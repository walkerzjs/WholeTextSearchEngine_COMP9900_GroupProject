<P>

	<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:    This is an application by Cecil Walter Gidley brought
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> for an order determining
minimum terms and additional terms in respect of the life sentences imposed on
him by Mr Justice Roden on
22nd April 1983.  
<P>

2		On 21st March 1983 the applicant was indicted before Roden J on an
indictment containing two counts of murder and one each of
robbery with
striking and armed robbery.  He pleaded not guilty to the two charges of murder
and guilty to the two robbery matters.
 On 31st March 1983 the jury returned
verdicts of guilty in respect of each count of murder.  The matter was stood
over for sentence
to 22nd April 1983.  On that occasion two further indictments
were presented and the applicant when arraigned upon them pleaded guilty
to a
series of further charges. Those were as follows:  (i) escape from lawful
custody, (ii) stealing, (iii) use offensive weapon
with intent to prevent
lawful apprehension, (iv) possess shortened firearm, (v) break enter and steal,
(vi - ix) four counts of kidnapping,
(x) forgery, (xi) uttering, and (xii)
steal from a dwelling.  
<P>

3	Additionally there was one count of armed robbery to which the applicant
pleaded not guilty. It should be noted that in relation
to the charge of break
enter and steal the applicant asked that a further seven matters appearing on a
schedule be taken into account.
 Those additional charges comprised a break
enter and stealing offence together with three instances each of forging and
uttering.
 
<P>

4		It appears that the applicant called no evidence on sentence nor were any
submissions addressed to his Honour on the applicant's
behalf.  As at 22nd
April 1983 sentences of life imprisonment in respect of the convictions for
murder were mandatory unless it appeared
to the sentencing judge that the
prisoner's culpability for the crimes was significantly diminished by
mitigating circumstances.
 There was nothing of that nature in the facts of
this case.  In that sense it might be thought unsurprising that no material was
placed before the sentencing judge.  I note that during the course of the trial
the applicant withdrew his instructions from his
solicitor and counsel and
thereafter appeared unrepresented.  
<P>

5		The facts of the two murders are summarised in the Statement of Facts
prepared by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions
in accordance
with Practice Note 57.  The applicant through his legal representatives filed a
Notice dated 7th December 1998 in which
he stated his acceptance of the
Statement of Facts.  On the hearing of this application the applicant gave
evidence and sought to
supplement aspects of the facts as agreed.  I will come
to this aspect shortly.
<P>

6	At about 5pm on 30th January 1982 the applicant, probably in company with an
unidentified companion, went to premises at 9 Moonbria
Street, Naremburn.  The
applicant was armed with a sawn-off 12 gauge double barrel shotgun. The
premises were the home of Bernard
and Elsa Levine.  They were an elderly couple
both in their seventies.  Mrs Levine was five years older than her husband.
There is
nothing to suggest that they had ever met the applicant or his
companion.  It is likely that Mr and Mrs Levine opened the front door
of the
premises since the police detected no signs of forced entry.  Once the
applicant gained entry to the premises it appears that
he or his companion made
demands of the Levines which were not met.  Thereafter the applicant struck
each of them over the head on
more than one occasion with the butt of the
shotgun fracturing their skulls and occasioning the fatal injuries.
<P>

7	A little after 8am the following morning the Levines' son-in-law, Herbert
Kalcher, happened on the scene.  He looked through a
partially open window in
the lounge room and saw the body of his father-in-law lying on the floor with
blood on the carpet nearby.
 He entered the house through a window and saw his
mother-in-law lying near her husband with blood on the back of her head.  The
police were called to the premises and they observed blood stains on the lounge
room curtains, the window frame, inside the front
door, on the western wall of
the lounge room, the television set and a cupboard in the lounge room.  That
was in addition to the
blood on the bodies and on the carpet near where the
bodies were lying.  Police also observed that the telephone receiver was off
its rest and the cord had been forcibly pulled from the socket.  Drops of blood
were located in other rooms of the house. 
<P>

8	The post mortem examination of Bernard Levine revealed six large lacerations
around the left side of his head and forehead.  There
were several small skin
abrasions on the shoulders and back, haemorrhages in the upper lids of both
eyes, a fracture to the right
side of the jaw bone, and several fractures
extending from the right side of the skull to the base of the left hand side
and again
at the back of the skull.  An autopsy performed on the deceased Elsa
Levine found seven large lacerations on the head and a Y-shaped
fracture to the
base of the skull at the back of the head.  It was the doctor's opinion that
the application of considerable force
would be required to inflict the injuries
to both the deceased's skulls.  
<P>

9	At the time of the commission of these murders the applicant was an escapee.
He had been serving a sentence at the Malabar Training
Centre and on 17th
January 1982 he failed to return from day leave. He had been serving a sentence
of balance of parole. That sentence
was due to expire on 8th March 1982.  
<P>

10	Three days after the murder of Bernard and Elsa Levine the applicant entered
a firm of estate agents at Bondi Junction armed
with a sawn-off rifle.  He
committed a robbery obtaining the sum of just under $4,000.  In the course of
that robbery he struck a
customer with his shotgun.  It was this conduct which
gave rise to the offences of armed robbery and robbery with striking to which
the applicant pleaded guilty before Mr Justice Roden on the day his trial for
the two murders commenced.  
<P>

11	Three days after the armed robbery the applicant  broke and entered premises
in Lugarno with a view to stealing firearms which
he had been informed were to
be found there.  He was disturbed by the activation of an alarm in those
premises.  He left and entered
a home nearby where making use of a sawn off
shotgun to back-up his demands he required the householders, including an
infant child,
to accompany him in their car.  This behaviour gave rise to the
four charges of kidnapping.  
<P>

12	The following day whilst in Grace Bros at Warringah Mall the applicant was
seen to remove a price ticket from a carry bag.  He
produced his sawn-off
shotgun to prevent arrest in those premises.  That gave rise to the charge of
stealing and of using an offensive
weapon with intent to prevent lawful
apprehension.  On the same day he broke into premises in Hunters Hill where he
stole a number
of items including a cheque book.  On 13th February 1982 on four
occasions he used cheques from the stolen cheque book.  On 15th
February he
stole a number of items from a dwelling house in Fairlight.  He was arrested on
16th February 1982.  
<P>

13	At the time of his arrest he was in possession of the shortened double
barrel shotgun which was the subject of one of the counts
in the indictment to
which he pleaded guilty.  
<P>

14	In relation to the offences of armed robbery and robbery with striking and
the four counts of kidnapping Mr Justice Roden  imposed
concurrent sentences of
ten years penal servitude. The remaining charges were the subject of sentences
subsumed by the ten year terms.
 All determinate sentences were expressed to
commence from 8th March 1982 and were concurrent with the two life sentences
which also
commenced on that date.  His Honour declined to specify a non-parole
period in relation to the determinate sentences.
<P>

15	On 16th September 1983 the applicant attempted to escape from the Central
Industrial Prison at Long Bay.  On 8th August 1985
he was sentenced to a term
of two years in relation to this offence.  
<P>

16	On 16th October 1989 the applicant succeeded in escaping from the Grafton
prison.  He was at liberty for a period of fifty days.
 On 6th December 1989 he
was arrested in South Australia.  He was subsequently returned to custody in
New South Wales.  He was convicted
of this escape following a trial before
Judge Phelan and a jury.  On 28th October 1991 his Honour imposed a sentence of
imprisonment
for a period of four years and one day comprising a minimum term
of three years and one day with an additional term of one year.
 The sentence
was expressed to commence from the date of its imposition. It is apparent from
his Honour's remarks on sentence that
he took a serious view of this escape
which he found to have been the product of sophisticated planning.  
<P>

17	The applicant has a lengthy criminal history.  His first custodial sentence
was imposed on 10th October 1968.  There are a number
of entries for the
possession and use of prohibited drugs, breaking entering and stealing,
escaping from lawful custody and larceny.

<P>

18	A quantity of material has been placed before me on this application
disclosing the applicant's progress in custody over the
past seventeen years.
The bulk of this material is in the form of the reports of the Serious
Offenders Review Board, later the Serious
Offenders Review Council ("the
Council"), together with annexures thereto.  
<P>

19	In the first of those reports under the hand of retired Judge Gee QC, the
following observation is made:
<P>

	"He has the reputation for being a notorious heroin addict and many of his
earlier offences have been associated with drug taking.
 As time passed,
however, there have been increasing signs that he suffers from bouts of serious
mental illness and that his drug
taking has served only to mask this
problem."
<P>

20	The report goes on to refer to the applicant's admission to the North Ryde
Psychiatric Centre on 21st April 1968.  On that occasion
it appeared that he
was suffering from delusions reportedly caused by drug taking.  
<P>

21		In 1986 the applicant spent three months in the Parklea Drug Unit.
Generally, he appears to have received a favourable assessment
there.
Significantly, officers monitoring his conduct made the following
observations:
<P>

	"Cec can be quite rational for many days or even weeks.  However there are
times when he displays psychotic behaviour."
<P>

22	David Roland, a psychologist, who worked closely with the applicant at the
Drug Unit made this observation in a report dated
16th May 1986:
<P>

	"He can go through swift mood swings where he becomes very resentful, angry
and quite irrational in his thinking, the latter tending
towards paranoia.  It
certainly shows a side of him that is close to psychotic."
<P>

23	The applicant was a witness before the ICAC Inquiry into the use of
informers. Commissioner Temby described his behaviour as
"quite aberrant" and
observed that he was a man who wrote "letters that appear to be the product of
a seriously disturbed mind".
 
<P>

24		The first assessment of the applicant as suffering from a psychiatric
illness appears to have been that made by Dr Barclay in
a report dated 24th May
1993.  Dr Barclay interviewed the applicant at the Metropolitan Reception
Prison, Long Bay, on 8th March
1993. He had then served eleven years of the
present sentence. In reviewing material relating to the applicant's background,
Dr Barclay
referred to a note prepared by an officer at Parklea Prison in May
1987. That officer had suggested that it was desirable for the
applicant to
undergo a psychiatric assessment.  Dr Barclay also made reference to the
contents of a letter written by the applicant
on 14th July 1987 which was
indicative of confused thinking and probably represented an example of thought
disorder.  Significantly,
Dr Barclay commented on the contents of some diaries
maintained by the applicant which were apparently produced at his trial.  There
appears to have been a suggestion that the contents of the diary entries was
psychotic.  
<P>

25	At the time the applicant spoke with Dr Barclay he appears to have been
quite florid.  Dr Barclay recited the numerous conspiracy
theories advanced by
the applicant during the interview together with the applicant's denial of his
involvement in the murders of
the Levines.  At that time, among other things,
the applicant asserted that the Levines were a Jewish couple and that Roden J
was
prominent in the Jewish community.  He told Dr. Barclay:
<P>

	"It was useful to me to appear to be guilty at that time because it served the
purpose."
<P>

26	He went on to tell Dr Barclay that he believed that because he appeared to
have been guilty of killing two prominent Jewish people
that the Muslims saw
him as supportive of their mission for social change. Dr Barclay recorded that
the applicant told him:
<P>

	"I am an initiated member of the temple because Mum's, my mother's line goes
back to a Davidian line.  I was taken to Stonehenge
as a child.  Not the normal
lodgers - my little temple which is a line from the temple Philista.  I believe
in God but not in a fundamentalist
way.  I like Eastern concepts of God."
<P>

27		Prior to this in 1986 the applicant, in an apparently more rational moment,
had admitted his guilt of the murder of the Levines
to the psychologist, Mr
Roland, at the Parklea Drug Unit.  Dr Barclay concluded his report in these
terms:
<P>

	"In my opinion Gidley is mentally ill.  I have considered the possibility that
he is making all this up but I think it is unlikely
when one looks back over
the history of events and the hints that have been given over the years of
Gidley having an underlying psychotic
disorder.  At this stage what he says is
indicative of paranoid delusions with grandiosity and persecutory ideas.  He
believes that
he is in some way a member of a special temple, that he has
selected university students working on genetic programming, that he
has
infiltrated with viruses the intelligence computers of a number of the major
intelligence agencies of Australia and the world,
and that people come to the
prison to interview him about his viruses in their computer programmes."
<P>

28	Dr Barclay went on to observe that it would be interesting to see what
effect any anti-psychotic treatment might have on the
applicant.  He noted that
it was improbable that the applicant would be co-operative in taking
medication.  
<P>

29		On 30th September 1994 when the Council reviewed the applicant it resolved
that he should be transferred to the Long Bay Prison
Hospital for psychiatric
assessment as at that time his condition appeared to be "deteriorating".  For
various reasons which are
set out in more detail in the Council's report of
17th September 1997  no psychiatric assessment appears to have been made until
late April of 1995.  On 3rd May 1995 Dr Jonathan Carne reported to the Council
that there was "strong evidence that Mr Gidley is
suffering from a mental
illness.  The illness has features of grandiosity, hostility and paranoid
delusions and formal thought disorder".
 Dr Carne expressed the view that a
course of anti-psychotic medication should be trialed. He shared Dr Barclay's
doubts that the
applicant would co-operate with a regime of medication and, at
that time, there were not sufficient grounds for imposing a compulsory
regime.

<P>

30	There are indications, apart from the contents of the psychiatric reports,
to suggest that in the mid-1990's the applicant was
mentally unwell.  In an
interview with the Visiting Committee of the Council on 31st January 1996 it
was noted that he was co-operative
but "still lost in fantasy".  Amongst other
things he told the Committee members that "the Jews had control of me for a
long time".
 Later that year in August when the Visiting Committee
re-interviewed the applicant he gave an account that he was Richard Truman
and
that "when he had escaped he stayed with Japanese people from IBM" who would be
"happy to have him back to stay when he is released".
 
<P>

31	At the beginning of the following year the Visiting Committee attempted to
interview the applicant but he refused to attend.
 His case management officer
advised, "Cecil is not currently in touch with reality, has association
problems with life".
<P>

32	The present application made pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A</a> was first filed in 1991.  For
a variety of reasons including, no doubt, the pending trial and subsequent
sentence imposed by Judge
Phelan, the matter did not progress for some time.
Again, it is noteworthy that in July 1995 the applicant told the Visiting
Committee
that he had decided to withdraw instructions from the Legal Aid
Commission in respect of this application because they were "all
out to get me,
they're communists".  Mr Nicholson SC, who appears on behalf of the applicant
on the present application, tendered
letters written by the applicant to Mr
Grahame of the Legal Aid Commission in mid-1995.  Their content is quite
bizarre.
<P>

33	Dr Carne reviewed the applicant on 18th July 1996.  He reported that the
applicant had refused to take his advice concerning
anti-psychotic medication.
At that time Dr Carne was of the opinion that there were still no grounds for
compulsory medication. 

<P>

34	On 19th August 1997 Dr Carne provided a further report relating to the
applicant.  At that time it appears that the applicant
was again quite florid.
He spoke of Hannibal's elephants, artificial intelligence and scanning other
people's minds using telepathic
techniques.  Old Testament imagery played its
part too.  In that report Dr Carne expressed the opinion that the applicant
suffered
from paranoid schizophrenia. Dr Carne concluded that the applicant
should be made a forensic patient.  He considered that the applicant's
future
and the welfare of the public would be better served if he were under the
supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
 On 9th September 1997 Dr
Ali, psychiatrist, provided a report on the applicant and concurred with Dr
Carne's conclusion that he
should be made a forensic patient and placed on
anti-psychotic medication.  As at 17th September 1997 when the Hon. Kep Enderby
QC
prepared a supplementary report on the applicant it was noted:
<P>

	"There is ample evidence to support the view that Gidley's behaviour reflects
that he is suffering from a serious mental illness
which perhaps in the past
has been difficult to diagnose or define.  Recent expert psychiatric opinion
suggests that Gidley's condition
is deteriorating and that his mental illness
is becoming more definable.  The SORC is of the view that if his condition does
not
ameliorate, Gidley will be unable to survive in normal community life and
will require institutional care for an indefinite period."
<P>

35	On 17th September 1997 the applicant was made the subject of an order
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.97(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Act 1990</a>.  As a forensic patient he
was transferred to the Long Bay Prison Hospital and his management became the
joint responsibility of
the Council and the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  
<P>

36	As a forensic patient the applicant was placed on anti-psychotic medication.
The effects appear to have been dramatic.  On 3rd
June 1998 the Assessment
Committee of the Council interviewed him and noted that he was described by
members of the Custodial and
Inmate Development Services Staff as being
well-behaved, polite and volunteering to undertake tasks.
<P>

37		On 30th July 1998 the Mental Health Review Tribunal recommended to the
Minister for Health that the applicant should cease to
be detained as a
forensic patient on the basis that:
<P>

	"Mr Gidley is intelligent and resourceful, and is compliant with medication.
...  Mr Gidley has developed reasonable insight into
the long-term benefits to
him, in terms of achieving eventual release, of voluntary compliance with an
anti-psychotic medication
regime."
<P>

38	On 13th August 1998 the Minister for Health approved the recommendation.
The applicant ceased being a forensic patient and was
returned to his former
custody.  Since that time and to date the applicant has been receiving periodic
injections of a drug known
as Zuclopenthaol-Decanate.  This is a long-acting
anti-psychotic medication. Currently the applicant receives injections at four
weekly intervals.  
<P>

39		In a Supplementary Report prepared by the Council dated 10th November 1998
it is observed:
<P>

	"The current medication regime being adopted by Gidley has caused an
appreciable difference in his behaviour, as evidenced by the
lucidity of his
recent written communication to the SORC.  Previously, there was ample evidence
to support the view that Gidley's
behaviour indicated that he was suffering
from a serious mental illness."
<P>

40	The Crown opposes the determination of a minimum term for this applicant.
It is the Crown's primary submission that these murders
fall within the worst
category of case and exhibit features of heinousness (and an absence of
features of mitigation) such as to
make it appropriate that the applicant
remain in custody for the rest of his life:  Twala (unreported, NSWCCA, 4th
November 1994)
per Badgery-Parker J at 7;  Kalazich  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 41</a> at
50-51.  In the alternative the Crown submitted that were a determinate sentence
to be imposed the additional term specified should
be for the remainder of the
applicant's natural life.
<P>

41		In submitting that these killings exhibited features of heinousness that
would justify a refusal to set a determinate sentence,
the Crown invited me to
find that the applicant deliberately killed the Levines in order to do away
with witnesses.  My attention
was drawn to the contents of a report prepared by
David Roland dated 15th August 1986 which recorded an admission made to him by
the applicant in these terms:
<P>

	"Soon after his escape he collapsed with a stomach injury and was taken to
hospital.  As soon as he could walk and while still
suffering pain he left the
hospital and met a friend who said he knew of a private residence where they
could obtain $80,000 and
Gidley agreed to this.  During this time he was using
heroin and drinking heavily which had the effect of staving off the pain he
was
experiencing.  At the time Gidley and his accomplice were so intoxicated that
they got the number of the house mixed up.  After
ransacking the house and not
finding the money Gidley brutally bashed the two elderly residents to death so
as not to leave any witnesses.
 Following on in close succession Gidley
committed the other offences in an attempt to acquire the funds he required for
a trip to
America."
<P>

42	In evidence before me the applicant said he had first made admissions as to
his guilt of the murders when he was a resident of
the Parklea Drug Unit.  He
said, "That was when I first felt guilty about what I had done in a sensible
manner, in a sane manner"
(T.5).  However, the applicant did not concede the
accuracy of the version David Roland attributed to him.  
<P>

43	The applicant's evidence concerning the killings was that he and an
accomplice, known only by the name of Jerry, planned to go
to the home of a
drug dealer in order to steal money.  The applicant had instructions as to
where the money was hidden.  He had the
number of the drug dealer's house
written on a piece of paper.  He must have made a mistake as to that number.
On arrival he was
not surprised to find two older people in the premises
because he believed the drug dealer lived with his parents. He and his
companion
arrived at the house with tape in order to tie up anyone who might be
present.  After gaining entry he went into a bedroom to look
for the money.
Jerry held the Levines captive in the lounge room.  Whilst the applicant was
searching for the money he heard the
sound of breaking glass. He went back into
the lounge room where he observed a struggle between Mr and Mrs Levine and
Jerry.  The
struggle was for control of the shotgun.  At the time the applicant
arrived Jerry had been pushed backwards and his elbow broke one
of the lounge
room windows.  At that point the applicant became involved in the struggle.  He
said this:
<P>

	"We got the upper hand and the Levines sustained - I hit them with the shotgun
over the head too hard, too hard, but I didn't know
at the time." (T.5).
<P>

44	He was asked what intention he had at that time and he replied:
<P>

	"I was panicking, probably because I was under the influence of drugs and
alcohol and - at that time of my life and my mind was
just a blank really."
(T.5).
<P>

45	He was asked whether he knew he was hitting them to which he replied:
<P>

	"It was a bit of a blur.  I was hearing voices at that time too.  So the whole
incident is a bit of a blur and I am not saying
that to make it easy to get out
of it, but it is a bit of a blur, the whole struggle episode, but I remember at
the end of it that
the Levines were laying on the floor and blood was coming
from their heads and I was concerned at that point that I might have killed
them." (T.5).
<P>

46	The applicant was cross-examined concerning the statements said to have been
made to Mr Roland in 1986.  He did not recall telling
Mr Roland that at the
time he had struck Mr and Mrs Levine he had an intent to kill.  He did not deny
such statements but indicated
he was unable to recall what he had told Mr
Roland.  In re-examination the applicant asserted that he had not made any
conscious
decision to not leave witnesses at the scene.  At T31 this exchange
is recorded:
<P>

	"Q.  Was the panic driven by any sense of the possibility that the matter
could be reported to the police and what that may lead
to? 
<P>

	A.  I was very drunk at the time so they may all have been factors rushing
through a criminal mind which I had but I find it very
hard to remember the
actual event.  I am not saying that to evade any question, I was very drunk and
very stoned and it was a sudden
struggle and it ended with the Levines, the
injuries took their lives."
<P>

47	In further cross-examination by leave the Crown Prosecutor put these matters
to the applicant:
<P>

	"Q.  I put to you that you told Mr Roland that the reason for you killing Mr
and Mrs Levine was so that you would not leave any
witnesses?
<P>

	A.  I don't think that is true.  I may have, I can't recall conversation with
David Roland.  I may have said that way back then
but I don't think so, I
really don't.
<P>

	Q.  And I put to you that is the reason you killed the Levines in order not to
leave any witnesses.  What do you say to that?
<P>

	A.  No, it was not that pre-planned, it was not that simple, it was more crazy
than that." (T.32).
<P>

48	I do not accept the applicant's account given in evidence as to the
circumstances surrounding the killings.  I consider the account
that the
elderly couple attempted to disarm a young man holding a double barrel shotgun
an unlikely one and the circumstance that
the applicant has previously given an
inconsistent version does not encourage me to accept the present one. However,
I am not prepared
to find as a fact beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant
deliberately formed an intention to kill the Levines in order to do
away with
them as witnesses.  I have no doubt that the applicant said that to Mr Roland
in the course of an interview in 1986.  At
that time the applicant also gave an
account that his co-offender was a married man with children.  This is in
contrast to the evidence
he gave before me on the hearing of the application.
I have no reason to consider either version as truthful.  In the course of
cross-examination
the applicant gave an account of why he had given the earlier
version about his co-offender. He said this:
<P>

	"I just wanted the issue dealt with so that everybody would relax about it,
because I had pressure on me to name him.  ...  So
I just made up a little
story that covered everything, kept everybody happy and got them all of my back
so that I could just make
admissions that I'd committed the murders, admissions
relating to me and me alone and I didn't get into any trouble with any other
prisoners, you know, by informing on anyone else and everybody was happy with
that at the time."
<P>

49	In the report of the Council signed by retired Judge Gee QC reference is
made to a further admission of guilt made by the applicant
in a letter to Mr
Schubert, the Superintendent of Classification, dated 23rd April 1986.  The
report goes on to observe that two
years later the applicant again wrote to
Superintendent Schubert on 21st April 1988.  On this occasion he denied
committing the murders
and gave a version of events described as being wildly
at variance with the one he had given to the psychologist at Parklea in August
of 1986.  The report states:
<P>

	"Both versions have a tinge of plausibility about them but neither version is
substantiated by contemporary records.  They appear
to be the products of a
mind with a tenuous grasp of reality."
<P>

50	Although, as I have indicated, I am not prepared to accept the somewhat
self-serving version given by the applicant in his evidence
before me, nor do I
consider it would be appropriate to sentence upon the version given to the
psychologist. I think it is reasonably
possible that the killings were, as the
applicant said, not preplanned and somewhat more crazy than the account to the
psychologist
would suggest.     
<P>

51		In approaching this application I give substantial weight to the comments
made by Mr Justice Roden when sentencing the applicant:
<P>

	"There is no account which I had from him in court upon the basis of which I
can assess the motive or purpose for these killings.
 It is clear from the
evidence that at or about the time of the two murders the home of the deceased
was ransacked in a manner indicating
that robbery was the motive.  However, the
home in which tragedy occurred was a modest suburban home which on the face of
it gave
no indication of the availability of any great wealth or of anything
else that may make the home attractive to a person bent upon
robbery.  Some of
the remarks attributed to the prisoner by witnesses called at the trial are
capable of suggesting that there was
a deeper motive behind the killings, and
that it is not unlikely that the prisoner believed that there would be some
money or other
property available at those premises.  The nature of those
remarks attributed to the prisoner and the nature of the killings are
also
capable of suggesting that the killings were either in the nature of an
assassination or the result of frustration when the
victims failed to deliver
to the prisoner whatever it was that he may have been expecting to find.  These
are all possibilities which
suggest themselves on the evidence, but they are no
more than that.  The evidence of the witnesses who saw the two men arrive also
suggests the possibility that they may have entered the wrong house by
mistake.
<P>

	For sentencing purposes I cannot properly settle upon any of those possible
versions of the facts.  But there is no basis upon
which I can do more than
regard these as brutal killings by a person who at the time was bent upon a
criminal enterprise."
<P>

52	I approach my task on an acceptance of his Honour Mr Justice Roden's view
that these were brutal killings by a person who was
bent upon a criminal
enterprise.
<P>

53		The objective criminality of these offences is of a very high order.  The
applicant took two lives.  The Levines were elderly,
they were in the sanctity
of their own home, they were very brutally bashed about the head and they had
done nothing to provoke any
assault upon them. 
<P>

54		A Victim Impact Statement signed by Mrs Maureen Kalcher was tendered in
evidence before me.  Provision is made for such statements
to be received and
considered by the court when determining an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a>;  s.23C(2) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act 1986</a>.  That statement was
signed by Mrs Kalcher on 8 August 1997.  She describes the terrible grief to
which she was subject following
the murder of her parents and the associated
severe depression which has plagued her since.  At that time she described
herself as
still living with the murders vividly present in her mind.  It would
appear that members of the Levine family attended the hearing
of this
application.  It is eloquent testimony of the love that Bernard and Elsa Levine
inspired that so many years later their loss
would continue to be so acutely
felt.  The court has noted the contents of the Victim Impact Statement and
extends its profound sympathy
to Mrs Kalcher and her children.  I am mindful of
the approach adopted by the former Chief Judge of the Common Law Division in R
v Previtera  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 A Crim R 76</a> at p.85 to the use to which such material
should be put in a case such as this.  I adopt that approach and it is not
necessary for
me to further refer to the matter.
<P>

55	Terrible as these two murders were I have come to the conclusion that it is
not an appropriate case in which the court should
decline to fix a determinate
sentence.  
<P>

56	The killing of the Levines and the violence inflicted during the course of
the armed robbery three days thereafter are, having
regard to the whole of the
applicant's criminal record and known history, somewhat uncharacteristic.  This
was a matter which Dr
Lucas remarked on in his report prepared for the
applicant's legal representatives dated 1st October 1998.  In that report Dr
Lucas
expresses this opinion:
<P>

	"Although I can reach no firm conclusion about the role his mental illness may
have played in the commission of the murders there
are hints that round this
time he was experiencing psychotic symptoms, which although not severe he
perceived as unusual even given
his long experience of drugs.  If this is so,
he may well have suffered some disturbance of judgement which combined with his
circumstances
led him into situations where for the first time he engaged in
violent offending.  Even if one does not accept this view, and it
is a
tentative one, there is no doubt that he later developed frank psychotic
symptoms which had been present intermittently during
his imprisonment.  The
fact that he has now received treatment with good effect and is compliant with
it suggests Mr Gidley's future
prospects may be considerably better than one
would previously have thought."
<P>

57	It would seem a number of features led to Dr Lucas' view that there were
hints that the applicant's mental illness may have played
some role in the
commission of the murders.  Dr Lucas considered that it is difficult to be
certain about the date of onset of the
applicant's psychotic illness but that
there were important indications that all was not well perhaps as far back as
1980 or 1981
(report page 4).  Interestingly, in his discussions with Dr Lucas
the applicant did not assert that the offences were committed because
of
delusions or hallucinatory experiences.  However, he did give an account of an
incident during his stay in America (prior to the
commission of the murders)
which was suggestive of a psychotic episode.  Dr Lucas observes that aspects of
the applicant's behaviour
during his trial for the murders appear to have been
unwise for an intelligent man (and there is no doubt that the applicant is an
intelligent man).  Apart from sacking his legal representatives it appears that
against the advice of the trial judge he insisted
that police note books and
his own diary be put into evidence.  It will be remembered that there is a
suggestion that the entries
in the diary were of a psychotic nature.  It also
appears that the applicant gave a history of auditory hallucinations in late
1981.
<P>

58		Dr Lucas gave evidence on the hearing of this application.  In the course
of his cross-examination the following passage appears
at T43-44:
<P>

	"Q.  And you don't go so far as to express the opinion that there was any
psychiatric pathology involved in the offences in 1982;
 you don't go that far
as asserting that?
<P>

	A.  I don't assert that the offence arose because of that or he would have had
a psychiatric defence.  I think there are hints
that he may not have been
psychiatrically well at that time, but as to whether he talked to voices, he
apparently told the psychologist
in the prison service about that, but if his
mental state was disturbed to some extent then, as well as the drink and drug,
I suspect
that may have played a part in three weeks of pretty disturbed
behaviour, in a criminal sense, but we don't know.  I think Dr Barclay
in his
report did at the bottom of his second last page, he wondered whether Mr
Gidley's disturbed mental state went back further
than he expected."
<P>

59	The view that the applicant's mental state was disturbed to some extent, and
that played a part in the three weeks of very disturbed
behaviour to which Dr
Lucas refers, receives some support from the circumstance that this appears to
be the only time when he has
engaged in acts of violence.  
<P>

60		In approaching my task under s.13A I must have regard to the circumstance
that this applicant stood for sentence before his
Honour on a total of sixteen
offences (together with the seven matters on the Schedule) together with the
subsequent sentences imposed
in relation to the escape matters; R v Fenech 4th
September 1997.  
<P>

61		The longest of the sentences imposed by Roden J were the ten year terms. I
am informed those expired with the operation of remissions
on 12th February
1989.  The Crown submitted that the applicant had served seven years, one month
and twenty-two days (as at the date
of the hearing of the application) as
exclusively referable to the life sentences.
<P>

	Mr Nicholson  submitted that the determinate sentences would, in the absence
of the concurrent terms of life imprisonment, have
been subject to non parole
periods. There was nothing in the applicant's criminal history that would have
denied him the benefit
of the non-parole period save that he stood for sentence
upon two counts of murder.  I accept that submission.
<P>

62		In Regina v Purdey  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2065%20A%20Crim%20R%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 65 A Crim R 441</a>, Hunt CJ at CL, dealing with an
application under s.13A in respect of a prisoner convicted both of murder and
of a series of armed
robbery offences in respect of which concurrent
determinate sentences had been imposed, discounted the latter to take into
account
notional non parole periods and their translation under the
transitional provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>. In this case any non parole
period would have expired prior to the commencement of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>. I
propose discounting the determinate sentences imposed by Mr Justice Roden to
take into account this consideration.
<P>

63		A minimum term set pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A</a> must commence on the day on which the
original sentence commenced or, if the person was remanded in custody for the
offence, on the
date on which the first such remand commenced; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A(5).</a> 
<P>

64	Any sentence which I determine, in lieu of the life sentence, must reflect
the objective criminality of the two murders.  It
must also reflect the
totality of criminality involved in all the offences for which Roden J imposed
concurrent sentences together
with the subsequent escape matters; Purdey;  R v
Fenech 4th September 1997.  However, it is plain that the sentence must not
exceed
that which is proportionate to the gravity of the murders; Veen v The
Queen [No.2] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 465</a> at 477.
<P>

65		In determining the minimum term pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>
I am not concerned to fix a date upon the expiry of which I consider the
applicant would be ready for release into the community;
 Regina v Dennis
(NSWCCA, 28th October 1992).  It is the role of the Board  to determine when a
prisoner's release is appropriate
having regard to the principle that the
public interest is of primary importance and that it has sufficient reason to
believe that
the prisoner, if released from custody, would be able to adapt to
normal community life;  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(e)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a>.  
<P>

66		I must have regard to the matters set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A(9)(a)</a>-(c) together with
any other relevant matter. In other respects my task is no different to that
which would have been undertaken by
the sentencing judge at the time the
original sentence was imposed had the penalty then been wholly at the
discretion of the judge;
Purdey at p.444.
<P>

67		The sentence to be imposed must take into account the different purposes
involved in the exercise of the sentencing discretion;
 the protection of
society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform.  
<P>

68		By reference to these, at times competing, considerations I must, in
relation to the minimum term, fix a period which justice
requires that the
applicant must serve before he becomes eligible for parole;  Power v The Queen
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20131%20CLR%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 131 CLR 623</a> at 628-9;  Regina v Maclay  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 112</a> at 122.  
<P>

69		The Crown has placed emphasis, among other things, on considerations of the
protection of society in relation to this applicant.
 In particular Mr Cogswell
SC has submitted that I would entertain doubts as to the applicant's personal
commitment to overcoming
his drug and alcohol addiction.  Considerable focus in
both the cross-examination of the applicant and of Dr Lucas was directed to
this issue.  It was submitted that since 1986, when the applicant participated
in the Parklea Drug Unit programme, he had not sought
to avail himself of any
structured course of drug rehabilitation.  I will come back to this
consideration shortly.  For present purposes
I note that the risk of
re-offending is a relevant factor in determining the minimum term;  Regina v
Leaver (unreported, CCA, 23rd
November 1994), Veen [No 2] at p.477.  
<P>

70		It does appear that the applicant was intoxicated, probably by a
combination of drugs and alcohol, at the time of the commission
of the murders.
In his evidence before me the applicant stated that he had not used heroin for
a long time now.  He had consumed
two smokes of marijuana while at the
hospital, while a forensic patient in 1997.  He considered that he had done
well in giving up
drugs.  He acknowledged that alcohol was a bigger problem for
him.  He told me:
<P>

	"Alcohol and violence I think are related in my life and I should be very
careful of alcohol.  I've attended drug and alcohol counselling
and I have to
watch the alcohol very carefully indeed, not to drink." (page 8)
<P>

71	In cross-examination the applicant was challenged as to his commitment to
constructive drug rehabilitation.  Generally, it was
his account that there was
little more he could have done during his period of incarceration.  He had on
occasions spoken with drug
and alcohol counsellors at the various institutions
in which he has been held.  He was not aware of ongoing programmes that had
been
available to him save for the Parklea Drug Unit.  The Crown drew attention
to material which suggested that the applicant had failed
to complete the
second phase of the Drug Unit programme. He also referred me to the report of
Mr Roland of 15th August 1986 which
suggested that indices of the applicant's
continuing commitment to drug rehabilitation would include involvement in
therapy programmes
such as those offered at the Drug Unit and the Special Care
Unit.  The applicant did enter the Special Care Unit in 1986 but he remained
there only a brief time.  He commenced the programme with a friend who was
discharged within a week. When his friend left the applicant
chose to leave
too.  
<P>

72	Whether the applicant should have remained in the Special Care Unit or
sought to undertake further treatment in the Parklea Drug
Unit in 1986 seems to
me to be of marginal assistance in addressing the issues both of dangerousness
and rehabilitation for the purpose
of this application.  There has been a good
deal of water under the bridge since that time.  I accept that the range of
opportunities
for participation in drug courses may have been limited over the
past ten years or more.  I also note the applicant's evidence that
on occasions
when he was spoken to by the Council's Visiting Committee and in his
discussions with drug and alcohol counsellors employed
by the Corrections
Health Service it was not suggested to him on any occasion that he needed to
enrol in further courses.  
<P>

73	This is not to say that in the event of his release the applicant ought not
to be subject to careful supervision in relation
to both drug and alcohol
abuse.  I accept that the applicant's optimism concerning his ability to deal
with his long-standing addiction
may be misplaced.  However, regard must be
paid to the circumstance that the applicant is now on medication to control his
psychiatric
illness. Dr Lucas said in the course of his evidence that the
medication has a "considerable and obvious stabilising effect" on the
applicant
(T.35.34). He doubted that on release the applicant would "relive his early
years again" (T.35.29). He thought his past
use of drugs may have involved an
element of self medication (T.35.45).   
<P>

74		In its report of 10th November 1998 the Council said:
<P>

	"So long as Gidley continues to appreciate the importance of taking his
medication and can be relied upon to do that, in the event
of his life sentence
being redetermined, there appears to be no reason why he could not return into
the community at the expiration
of any minimum term.  However, he will require
supervision by the Probation and Parole Service for a reasonable period after
his
release."
<P>

75	Dr Lucas in his report of 1st October 1998 observed:
<P>

	"I believe it would be of assistance to Mr Gidley and to the correctional
authorities if his sentence was determined.  The setting
of a minimum will
allow planning for his movement through the system so that his progress and
overall stability are tested and he
can be prepared for return to the
community.  If he is successful during this period it is important that when
released he receives
long-term supervision with the requirement that he
continue psychiatric treatment.  It goes without saying that abstinence from
drugs
and alcohol will be essential, not simply because of his past history of
abuse and dependence but also because a return to this pattern
of behaviour,
even at a minor level, will interfere with his psychiatric treatment."
<P>

76	The applicant's evidence which was not challenged was that he has insight
into the benefits of medication (T7). It is clear that
he has undergone a
significant improvement in his mental state over the past eighteen months.
Concerns as to future dangerousness
do not figure in the recent reports of the
Council.  For that matter, in the years prior to the identification and
treatment of his
mental condition, it is noteworthy that the applicant did not
conduct himself in a violent way in custody.  His conduct has been
manipulative
and bizarre at times but there is little in the material to suggest that the
minimum term imposed needs to reflect emphasis
on the protection of society;
cf Veen [No 2] at 473-4.  I regard the considerations of general deterrence and
retribution as more
prominent in the determination of this application.  
<P>

77		I am required to have regard to the knowledge of the original sentencing
court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life
was eligible to be
released on licence under s.463 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> and the practice
relating to the issue of such licences; s.13A(9)(a).  To this end statistical
material has been placed before me
in the form of an annexure to the report of
the Serious Offenders Review Board relating to the release on licence of
prisoners serving
life sentences between October 1981 and July 1989.  This
material shows that the mean time served before first release on licence
by the
161 prisoners the subject of the sample was 11.7 years (minimum of 3 years
maximum of 34 years). The limitations on the use
of this statistical material
have been referred to on a number of occasions by this court.  
<P>

78		This applicant was sentenced in relation to two murders.  They were
objectively very serious offences that would, as at the
date of sentence, have
been expected to result in a custodial component well in excess of the mean
length of time disclosed by the
statistics.  The circumstance that 92.5% of
life sentence prisoners served 15 years or less prior to release on licence is
of somewhat
more assistance in the determination of this application.
<P>

79		I have also been assisted by reviewing a number of s.13A determinations and
appeals arising from them which were supplied to
me by the Crown. 
<P>

80	In Robinson (28th November 1997) Abadee J dealt with an application on
behalf of a prisoner who stood convicted of two murders.
His victims were a 74
year old lady and her son both residents of Lightning Ridge.  In addition to
those crimes the applicant had
subsequently been convicted of the offence of
solicit to murder for which he received an 8 year term with a 6 year minimum
term specified.
 On the re-determination a minimum term of 16 years was set.
An additional term for the remainder of the applicant's natural life
was
imposed.  
<P>

81		In Spinks (unreported, CCA, 7th August 1997) the court rejected an appeal
against the severity of a sentence as redetermined
by Hunt CJ at CL on a s.13A
application.  The applicant had been sentenced for the crimes of murder and
robbery with striking and
wounding. The sentencing judge had said that each was
an appalling crime involving a brutal and cowardly attack on a defenceless
invalid pensioner living alone.  The applicant was a man with an extremely long
criminal record including a number of offences of
violence.  The sentence
imposed by Hunt CJ at CL was one of a minimum term of 20 years and an
additional term for the remainder of
the applicant's life. 
<P>

82		In Bell (18th April 1995) Finlay J  redetermined the sentence of a prisoner
who, while an escapee, had murdered one man and
robbed and wounded another.
The objective gravity of the murder was extremely grave.  The applicant had
presented a very real management
problem during his period in custody.  There
were a number of instances when he had assaulted prisoners.  The sentence as
redetermined
was one of 18 years minimum term with an additional term for the
remainder of his natural life.
<P>

83		In Sami Salameh (15th December 1998) McInerney J redetermined the sentence
of a prisoner who had been convicted of one count
of murder in May 1987.  At
the time the applicant was charged also with the possession of a shortened
firearm and larceny of a motor
vehicle. He and a co-accused, whilst disguised
with stockings over their faces and armed with a shotgun, robbed a jewellery
store
.  During the course of the robbery the applicant discharged the shotgun
killing the victim.  In addition to the serious criminality
involved in that
murder there were a number of other features which his Honour observed made the
case "extremely disturbing".  The
applicant had a long criminal record.  He was
on bail at the time the murder was committed.  Just prior to the murder he had
committed
other offences including an armed robbery involving the use of a
shotgun.  The applicant was described as having little going for
him in terms
of his behaviour in prison.  He had been "to say the least a very difficult
prisoner".  His Honour found himself wondering
whether the applicant would ever
be rehabilitated.  He was prepared to deal with his application on the basis
that there was some
chance of reform.  However, his Honour considered there was
a serious question as to the extent to which the applicant would represent
a
danger to the community upon his release on parole.  At the time of determining
the application he concluded there was a substantial
basis for considering that
the applicant would commit further crimes if released.  A minimum term of 23
years penal servitude was
imposed and an additional term for the remainder of
the applicant's life.
<P>

84		In Alexander (7th May 1999) Kirby J dealt with an application for
redetermination of two life sentences imposed on the applicant
in 1987.  He had
been found guilty of the murder of a women and her three year old daughter. The
applicant had been boarding at the
deceased's home.  During a dispute over the
payment of rent he obtained a length of electrical cord and strangled her.
When her three
year old child found him covering her body he struck her with a
piece of wood.  He stabbed the child and her mother. There was evidence
the
killing of the mother was premeditated.  The applicant had escaped whilst
serving the life sentence.  A minimum term of 21 years
was imposed with an
additional term of 8 years.  
<P>

85		A review of such material as is before me concerning this applicant's
conduct whilst in prison suggests that he has generally
been a compliant
prisoner who has pursued a variety of hobbies.  In 1995 the case officer's
assessment on the serious offender's
review form described him thus:
<P>

	"Cecil is of good character, well liked, communicates with other inmates.
Displays appropriate behaviour amongst peers and staff.
 A more settled and
mature inmate.  Enjoys his hobbies/interests in reading - manages to make his
time useful."
<P>

86	Around this time his unit supervisor described him in these terms:
<P>

	"Quiet, good, well behaved inmate.  Has a good sense of humour, nothing
adverse to report."
<P>

87	The following year the case officer's assessment noted that the applicant
mixed well in the unit and that he was involved in
unit activities.  His main
activities included pottery and music.  He was described as being "a bit exotic
at times" but always polite
and co-operative.
<P>

88		I accept the evidence of Dr Lucas that the applicant has a long-standing
history of psychiatric illness.  I accept that the
indications are that as far
back as 1980 or 1981 all was not well with the applicant in terms of his mental
health.  It would appear
his condition has fluctuated in the course of his
lengthy imprisonment.  Generally, even when behaving in a bizarre fashion
consistent
with the subsequent diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, the
applicant has been able to get on with staff and fellow inmates.  I
accept his
evidence that it is his present intention to continue with the medication since
he sees the benefits of him so doing.
 I consider that his prospects for
rehabilitation are good.  
<P>

89		I do not consider that this is an appropriate case in which to impose an
additional term for the remainder of the applicant's
natural life.  He is now
approaching 50 years of age.  The sentence I intend to impose will ensure a
lengthy period of supervision
such as is recommended by Dr Lucas.  
<P>

90		The application for the determination of minimum and additional terms is
granted.  In relation to each conviction for murder
pursuant to s.13A(4)(a)(i)
I set minimum terms of imprisonment of 19 years.  Each sentence is to commence
on 8th March 1982.  Those
sentences will expire on 7th March 2001.  Pursuant to
s.13A(4)(a)(ii) I set additional terms of 11 years to commence on 8th March
2001.
