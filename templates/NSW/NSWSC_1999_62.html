JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR :   These two summons seek that the defendant be dealt with
according to law for a total of eleven offences contrary
to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act 1987</a> (the Act). The Hon J.W Shaw QC, AG with Mr Lonergan appeared for the
prosecutor; Mr C.A. Porter QC and M. Burley appeared for the
defendant.  Mr
Porter tendered pleas of guilty to all offences on behalf of his client and by
consent the matters were heard together.
 Thanks to the cooperation of counsel,
the facts were presented by way of an agreed statement.  Matters in mitigation
were advanced
by way of statement and testimony from Mr John Shuster a director
of the defendant.  Factual contest was virtually non existent but
there was
some controversy about the conclusions to be drawn and assessments made.
<P>

2	I sketch background facts and for convenience I will number the offences
charged in summons 12923/94, 1-3 and the balance charged
in the summons
12823/97, 4-11. 
<P>

	<b>Offence No 1</b>
<P>

3	On 2 September 1994 an investigator in the employ of the prosecutor called at
a store operated by the defendant at Roselands Shopping
Centre where she saw
exhibited for sale amongst other things wooden toy trucks consisting of
carriages with a wooden screw driver.
 The inspector indicated that the product
would be tested to determine compliance with requisite standards.  The store
manager stated
that he would take the items off sale.  Subsequent tests in a
laboratory revealed the items presented an inhalation/ingestion hazard.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 2</b>
<P>

4	On the same visit on 2 September 1994 the investigator also took possession
of  products offered for sale described as wooden
toy abacus bus and toy abacus
cargo trucks.  These items failed a tension test and were, similarly to the
item mentioned in offence
1, assessed as presenting an inhalation/ingestion
hazard.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 3</b>
<P>

5	On 22 September 1994 the investigator returned to the Roselands store and
purchased four units of a toy product identified as
"Magic Balloon Blowpipe".
The attention of the store manager was drawn to the circumstance that the item
was the subject of a banning
order in force pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31</a> of the Act.  The
manager agreed to withdraw the product from sale immediately and indicated that
he would inform a director of the
defendant. 
<P>

	<b>Offence No 4</b>
<P>

6	On 7 November 1994 the manager of the major investigations unit on behalf of
the prosecutor attended the defendant's store at
Eastgardens where he purchased
three units of a product known as a "Tummy Trimmer".  He advised the store
manager that the item was
the subject of a banning order.  The item consisted
of home exercise equipment comprising two foot pedals connected to a bar handle
by a spring or springs. 
<P>

	<b>Offence No 5</b>
<P>

7	On 8 November 1994 an investigator attended the defendant's shop at Roselands
and observed 26 units of the "Tummy Trimmer" product.
 This manager was
informed of the banning order being in force and responded by indicating that
the products would be taken from
sale that day. 
<P>

8	It can be noted that in respect of this and the preceding offence, a public
recall notice was placed in various newspapers and
the store manager in each of
the stores operated by the defendant was instructed not to sell the item.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 6</b>
<P>

9	On 11 November 1994 an investigator attended the defendant's store at Erina
and purchased items including a children's toy known
as a "Super Jetfighter".
Subsequent testing disclosed failure of an applicable projectile test in that
after launch all 10 projectiles
discharged by the toy ruptured the test
aluminium foil.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 7</b>
<P>

10	On the same visit to Erina as is relevant to offence no 6, the investigator
purchased a "Pull Along Play Train".  A purchase
of this item was subjected to
testing and was subjected to "drop", "moving components" and "tension" tests
all of which it failed.
 It was assessed to present an inhalation/ingestion
hazard.
<P>

11	It can be noted that upon notification of these contraventions, the
defendant removed these products from sale and public recall
notices were
placed in the Sydney Morning Herald, Lake Macquarie News, Border Daily Mail,
Central Coast Express and La Fiamma newspapers.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 8</b>
<P>

12	 On 26 November 1994 the manager of the major investigations unit attended
the defendant's store at Westfield Shopping Centre
Liverpool where he observed
stacks of products described as "Santa Bags" displayed for sale.  He purchased
three of these units after
which he spoke to the store manager and informed him
that the products were the subject of a banning order in force under 31(1) of
the Act.  The goods lacked required perforation holes which provide an obvious
safety factor in the event that the bags are misused
by young children.  The
manager responded that he would remove the product from sale.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	Offence No 9</b>
<P>

13	On the following day (27 November) the manager returned to the Liverpool
store where he again observed stacks of "Santa Bags".
 The evidence does not
persuade me that there was a deliberate flouting of the advice and undertaking
given on the previous day.
 The investigations of Mr Shuster reveal that the
probable reason for the remainder being present was the incomplete carrying out
of instruction compounded by the inadequacy of supervision.
<P>

14	In relation to the "Santa Bags" public recall notices were placed in the
Sydney Morning Herald, Lake Macquarie News, Border Daily
Mail, Central Coast
Express and La Fiamma newspapers.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 10</b>
<P>

15	On 27 November 1994 an investigator attended the defendant's store at Erina
and commenced an inspection after speaking to the
manager.  This revealed
approximately 90 elastic luggage straps displayed for sale to each of which was
affixed the requisite display
 "WARNING. Avoid eye injury. Do not overstretch.
Strap may rebound."  Other straps were displayed for sale which did not bear
the
requisite warning label.
<P>

16	A public recall was implemented by the defendant and notices placed in
various newspapers.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Offence No 11</b>
<P>

17	On 13 December 1994 an investigator attended the defendant's premises at Top
Ryde.  On entering the store she observed "Super
Jetfighter" toys displayed for
sale.  Nineteen of this unit were available and the investigator purchased
three.  The "Super Jetfighter"
was of the same type as described in relation to
offence no. 6.  Undertakings had been given in this Court in proceedings for
interlocutory
injunction concerning the non availability of such items for
sale.  That circumstance was drawn to the attention of the manager.
 As already
observed, this toy failed a requisite projectile test.  It was agreed that the
store at Top Ryde had not opened for business
at the time the prosecutor
alerted the defendant to its concerns regarding the  "Super Jetfighters".
Notification was given on 11
November 1994 and the directive for removal given
on 14 November.  The Top Ryde store had opened for the first time on 12
November.
 The agreed statement of facts records that upon discovering failure
by the manager (of the Top Ryde store) to act on the directive
the defendant
immediately called an emergency meeting involving all of its Sydney managers to
ensure that all necessary procedures
were in place and that all of the managers
understood them.
<P>

18	In respect of each of the offences the defendant, being a corporation is
liable to potential penalties not exceeding a fine of
$100,000.
<P>

19	The defendant has no prior convictions under this Act.  It was not suggested
that there was relevant conduct or relevant offences
to the taking into account
in respect of any matters touching the defendant since these occurrences all of
which occurred in the
span between 2 September and 13 December 1994.
<P>

	<b>Mitigation</b>
<P>

20	I have referred to the evidence of Mr Shuster.  I accept he was a witness of
truth, indeed no suggestion that I ought find otherwise
was made.  He accepted
the amendment to some details of his statement put to him in cross examination.
It is unnecessary to recite
that material but I should record the thrust of the
principal matters which I understood to be relied upon by Mr Porter.  The
tabulation
is my own and is adopted for convenience and I will interpolate
remarks where appropriate.
<P>

(a)	An order for payment of the prosecutor's costs is not opposed and it is
agreed that the sum sought ($89,772) is a final figure
including all aspects of
the litigation.  The Attorney General confirmed a concession that in fixing
fines for the offences the acceptance
by the defendant of the obligation to pay
these costs would be a matter for consideration.      
<P>

(b) 	The pleas of guilty themselves attract leniency.  I would take these into
account in favour of the defendant on two bases,
first evidencing genuine
regret on the part of the defendant's directors for the offences (the usual
expression of contrition seems
ill fitted where a corporation is involved) and,
second, crediting the utilitarian value of saving the State the cost of any
extended
trial.  The latter is of particular value where the material is
assembled and put before the Court as Mr Porter commented (and I
agree) with
"considerable commonsense by the parties".
<P>

(c)	The offences are somewhat stale, all being committed over four years ago.
No blame for delay is sought to be attributed to the
prosecutor and I was
informed that there had been "various negotiations".  I will regard the matter
of the four year delay as essential
neutral but I take into account the
corollary that in the progress of legislative action, the community becomes
more safety conscious
and it might realistically be said that attention to
potential product danger by a trader might be expected to be more acutely
focussed
in 1999 than it might have been in 1994.
<P>

(d)	In response to investigation the defendant made full and candid
disclosure.
<P>

(e)	In no case was it suggested that the breach was deliberate.  It was
submitted that neither would I find any of them reckless.
 There is no need to
elaborate upon the standard of culpability to qualify as recklessness in
connection with penal sanction.  I
find that the defendant did not act
recklessly in respect of any of the offences.
<P>

(f)	The defendant was faced with compliance in an area made difficult by the
differences in requirements from State to State.  It
was implied that it was
not unreasonable to obtain goods from reputable suppliers (as was not
challenged) which were stated to comply
with European standards and assumed
therefore not to require further investigation.  I accept that this approach
was bona fide but
I reject that it was reasonable.  The defendant self
evidently made the decision to trade in New South Wales and it was plainly
incumbent
upon it to make adequate arrangements to become informed of the
requirements in this State and to meet them.  Effectively nothing
was done
other than rely upon the implication that satisfaction for one standard could
be assumed to be universal  until the prosecutor's
investigations provoked some
activity.
<P>

(g)	It was conceded that in 1994 compliance mechanisms of the defendant were
not "as good as they should have been" but that the
measures now being taken
including the employment of a highly experienced toy buyer and the testing of
items at external laboratories
was as much as could reasonably be expected.
Attention was drawn to the costs incurred in allied responses following the
prosecutor's
investigation.  I am persuaded by the submission that this
expenditure as such is not realistically an amount to be taken into account
in
mitigation.  The defendant ought to have been complying in any event with
requirements and the cost involved was a requirement
of carrying on the chosen
business.  The additional costs are a direct result of the circumstance that
the defendant did not make
timely arrangements to effect compliance.
<P>

(h)	There has been no report of anyone being injured with the items.  In this
regard and the issue of expenditure canvassed in the
preceding paragraph I
would respectfully echo the remarks of Einfeld J (dealing with a parallel
provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> and a toy called "Happy Hippo"):
<P>

	"There is an important public interest at stake and although the standards are
arbitrary, the existence of such standards is widespread
around the western
world if not virtually universal.  Business people must be conscious of their
responsibilities in this regard,
even if it means factoring into their price
structures the cost consequences of having to ensure that their products are
safe and
rejecting those that are not.  It is only a matter of luck that no
child was hurt from the dangerous nature of this particular toy"
: <b>McInnes v
Global Imports Pty Limited</b> 1993 ATPR 41-206.
<P>

(i)	Some balance sheets of the defendant were produced and it was asserted that
they showed that the company was not in a position
to pay heavy fines.  I am
not equipped to analyse the account methods which led to the production of the
balance sheets but I can
observe that as at 30 June 1998 the stated nett assets
appear to approach $9,000,000 and there is a record of retained profits
exceeding
$5,000,000.  Operating revenue (which I take to be virtually the
annual takings) was over $115,000,000 and in the light of all the
figures I am
unwilling to conclude that the negatively assessed profit/loss figure
demonstrates any relative impoverishment.
<P>

(j)	None of the offences was particularly serious.  The prosecutor expressly
challenged this submission and I would uphold the challenge.
 No doubt the
outcome might have been more serious, for example if actual injury had taken
place, but in dealing with preventative
safety measures, exposure to risk
resulting from simple non compliance is  itself serious and in my view cannot
be categorized any
more mildly.
<P>

(k)	Any claim to dismissal pursuant to s 556A of the Crimes Act was disavowed
and Mr Porter realistically acknowledged that fines
should be imposed.  It was
reiterated that the defendant had no prior convictions and the evidence of Mr
Shuster that the defendant
had acted exactly in compliance with the law in 1994
was not contradicted.  Finally attention was directed to an asserted sense of
practical duplication in some of the offences in that they related to identical
goods.  Section 62(4) of the Act which reflects the
flavour of the principles
of totality was referred to.  In the light of my assessment of appropriate
penalty its specific terms do
not need to be applied and I shall limit myself
to giving appropriate indications when imposing the fines.  
<P>

	<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

21	I conclude that the evidence shows that the responses of the defendant were
such that the element usually referred to as "personal
deterrence" would not be
of any great significance.  The offences do however relate to matters of public
safety and the element of
"public deterrence" is of significant concern.  There
should be a clear signal to traders that offences arising out of breaches of
safety requirement will not be lightly tolerated.  Nevertheless in the
particular circumstances of these offences and for the reasons
adumbrated above
the amount of penalty should be tempered but it should be recognized that
considerable leniency has been integrated
into the assessment of amount.  As I
have already mentioned it is necessary to give special account to the consent
of the defendant
to pay the substantial amount representing the whole legal
costs of proceedings brought by the prosecutor.
<P>

	<b>Penalties</b>
<P>

22	I impose the following fines and I add some notations concerning the
assessment of the discrete amounts.
<P>

	<b>First Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Second Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

Both the first and second offences relate to wooden toys.  The defendant has
ceased all trade of such items.
<P>

	<b>Third Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.  
<P>

The neglect to discover the chemical content which included benzine was
particularly significant in the case of an item which required
little attention
to lead to a conclusion that prudence would demand investigation and
examination. 
<P>

	<b>Fourth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.
<P>

	<b>Fifth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

The fourth and fifth offences relate to the same stock discovered in separate
stores on succeeding days.  Qualified by my earlier
remarks about electing to
move into this State to trade, I accept that the defendant marketed these items
in the knowledge that there
was no ban upon them in the States where it had
previously operated namely Victoria and South Australia.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Sixth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.  
<P>

The design of the toy including the potential to launch projectiles is a matter
which adds in my view to culpability when no adequate
testing or inspection is
undertaken.  
<P>

	<b>Seventh Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.
<P>

	<b>Eighth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.
<P>

	<b>Ninth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.  
<P>

The eighth and ninth offences concern the "Santa Bags".  The need for air holes
in such bags to avoid risk to some of our most vulnerable
population is widely
appreciated.  The description suggests that the bags were likely to come into
the possession of the extremely
young.  I regard it as being just as important
to have adequately supervised and ensured compliance with withdrawal after
attention
was drawn (ninth offence) as the failure to appreciate and act on the
danger.
<P>

	<b>Tenth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

The elastic straps were most likely to be used by adults.  As only some of the
items were not labelled, the oversight can to an
extent be understood if not
excused.  
<P>

	<b>Eleventh Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

As this is the same item as related to the sixth offence being the toy jet
plane which launched projectiles.  It was apparently
stocked in a store prior
to opening and I have taken into account that there are two offences in respect
of the same item and that
there was the infortuitous timing of the
investigation and the opening of the store.
<P>

23	The total of the fines imposed above is $30,000.  I further order the
defendant to pay the prosecutor's costs assessed at $89,772.
 I note that
payment may be enforced in respect of both these amounts pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/" class="autolink_findacts">Fines
Act 1996</a>.

11	It can be noted that upon notification of these contraventions, the
defendant removed these products from sale and public recall
notices were
placed in the Sydney Morning Herald, Lake Macquarie News, Border Daily Mail,
Central Coast Express and La Fiamma newspapers.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 8</b>
<P>

12	 On 26 November 1994 the manager of the major investigations unit attended
the defendant's store at Westfield Shopping Centre
Liverpool where he observed
stacks of products described as "Santa Bags" displayed for sale.  He purchased
three of these units after
which he spoke to the store manager and informed him
that the products were the subject of a banning order in force under 31(1) of
the Act.  The goods lacked required perforation holes which provide an obvious
safety factor in the event that the bags are misused
by young children.  The
manager responded that he would remove the product from sale.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	Offence No 9</b>
<P>

13	On the following day (27 November) the manager returned to the Liverpool
store where he again observed stacks of "Santa Bags".
 The evidence does not
persuade me that there was a deliberate flouting of the advice and undertaking
given on the previous day.
 The investigations of Mr Shuster reveal that the
probable reason for the remainder being present was the incomplete carrying out
of instruction compounded by the inadequacy of supervision.
<P>

14	In relation to the "Santa Bags" public recall notices were placed in the
Sydney Morning Herald, Lake Macquarie News, Border Daily
Mail, Central Coast
Express and La Fiamma newspapers.
<P>

	<b>Offence No 10</b>
<P>

15	On 27 November 1994 an investigator attended the defendant's store at Erina
and commenced an inspection after speaking to the
manager.  This revealed
approximately 90 elastic luggage straps displayed for sale to each of which was
affixed the requisite display
 "WARNING. Avoid eye injury. Do not overstretch.
Strap may rebound."  Other straps were displayed for sale which did not bear
the
requisite warning label.
<P>

16	A public recall was implemented by the defendant and notices placed in
various newspapers.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Offence No 11</b>
<P>

17	On 13 December 1994 an investigator attended the defendant's premises at Top
Ryde.  On entering the store she observed "Super
Jetfighter" toys displayed for
sale.  Nineteen of this unit were available and the investigator purchased
three.  The "Super Jetfighter"
was of the same type as described in relation to
offence no. 6.  Undertakings had been given in this Court in proceedings for
interlocutory
injunction concerning the non availability of such items for
sale.  That circumstance was drawn to the attention of the manager.
 As already
observed, this toy failed a requisite projectile test.  It was agreed that the
store at Top Ryde had not opened for business
at the time the prosecutor
alerted the defendant to its concerns regarding the  "Super Jetfighters".
Notification was given on 11
November 1994 and the directive for removal given
on 14 November.  The Top Ryde store had opened for the first time on 12
November.
 The agreed statement of facts records that upon discovering failure
by the manager (of the Top Ryde store) to act on the directive
the defendant
immediately called an emergency meeting involving all of its Sydney managers to
ensure that all necessary procedures
were in place and that all of the managers
understood them.
<P>

18	In respect of each of the offences the defendant, being a corporation is
liable to potential penalties not exceeding a fine of
$100,000.
<P>

19	The defendant has no prior convictions under this Act.  It was not suggested
that there was relevant conduct or relevant offences
to the taking into account
in respect of any matters touching the defendant since these occurrences all of
which occurred in the
span between 2 September and 13 December 1994.
<P>

	<b>Mitigation</b>
<P>

20	I have referred to the evidence of Mr Shuster.  I accept he was a witness of
truth, indeed no suggestion that I ought find otherwise
was made.  He accepted
the amendment to some details of his statement put to him in cross examination.
It is unnecessary to recite
that material but I should record the thrust of the
principal matters which I understood to be relied upon by Mr Porter.  The
tabulation
is my own and is adopted for convenience and I will interpolate
remarks where appropriate.
<P>

(a)	An order for payment of the prosecutor's costs is not opposed and it is
agreed that the sum sought ($89,772) is a final figure
including all aspects of
the litigation.  The Attorney General confirmed a concession that in fixing
fines for the offences the acceptance
by the defendant of the obligation to pay
these costs would be a matter for consideration.      
<P>

(b) 	The pleas of guilty themselves attract leniency.  I would take these into
account in favour of the defendant on two bases,
first evidencing genuine
regret on the part of the defendant's directors for the offences (the usual
expression of contrition seems
ill fitted where a corporation is involved) and,
second, crediting the utilitarian value of saving the State the cost of any
extended
trial.  The latter is of particular value where the material is
assembled and put before the Court as Mr Porter commented (and I
agree) with
"considerable commonsense by the parties".
<P>

(c)	The offences are somewhat stale, all being committed over four years ago.
No blame for delay is sought to be attributed to the
prosecutor and I was
informed that there had been "various negotiations".  I will regard the matter
of the four year delay as essential
neutral but I take into account the
corollary that in the progress of legislative action, the community becomes
more safety conscious
and it might realistically be said that attention to
potential product danger by a trader might be expected to be more acutely
focussed
in 1999 than it might have been in 1994.
<P>

(d)	In response to investigation the defendant made full and candid
disclosure.
<P>

(e)	In no case was it suggested that the breach was deliberate.  It was
submitted that neither would I find any of them reckless.
 There is no need to
elaborate upon the standard of culpability to qualify as recklessness in
connection with penal sanction.  I
find that the defendant did not act
recklessly in respect of any of the offences.
<P>

(f)	The defendant was faced with compliance in an area made difficult by the
differences in requirements from State to State.  It
was implied that it was
not unreasonable to obtain goods from reputable suppliers (as was not
challenged) which were stated to comply
with European standards and assumed
therefore not to require further investigation.  I accept that this approach
was bona fide but
I reject that it was reasonable.  The defendant self
evidently made the decision to trade in New South Wales and it was plainly
incumbent
upon it to make adequate arrangements to become informed of the
requirements in this State and to meet them.  Effectively nothing
was done
other than rely upon the implication that satisfaction for one standard could
be assumed to be universal  until the prosecutor's
investigations provoked some
activity.
<P>

(g)	It was conceded that in 1994 compliance mechanisms of the defendant were
not "as good as they should have been" but that the
measures now being taken
including the employment of a highly experienced toy buyer and the testing of
items at external laboratories
was as much as could reasonably be expected.
Attention was drawn to the costs incurred in allied responses following the
prosecutor's
investigation.  I am persuaded by the submission that this
expenditure as such is not realistically an amount to be taken into account
in
mitigation.  The defendant ought to have been complying in any event with
requirements and the cost involved was a requirement
of carrying on the chosen
business.  The additional costs are a direct result of the circumstance that
the defendant did not make
timely arrangements to effect compliance.
<P>

(h)	There has been no report of anyone being injured with the items.  In this
regard and the issue of expenditure canvassed in the
preceding paragraph I
would respectfully echo the remarks of Einfeld J (dealing with a parallel
provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> and a toy called "Happy Hippo"):
<P>

	"There is an important public interest at stake and although the standards are
arbitrary, the existence of such standards is widespread
around the western
world if not virtually universal.  Business people must be conscious of their
responsibilities in this regard,
even if it means factoring into their price
structures the cost consequences of having to ensure that their products are
safe and
rejecting those that are not.  It is only a matter of luck that no
child was hurt from the dangerous nature of this particular toy"
: <b>McInnes v
Global Imports Pty Limited</b> 1993 ATPR 41-206.
<P>

(i)	Some balance sheets of the defendant were produced and it was asserted that
they showed that the company was not in a position
to pay heavy fines.  I am
not equipped to analyse the account methods which led to the production of the
balance sheets but I can
observe that as at 30 June 1998 the stated nett assets
appear to approach $9,000,000 and there is a record of retained profits
exceeding
$5,000,000.  Operating revenue (which I take to be virtually the
annual takings) was over $115,000,000 and in the light of all the
figures I am
unwilling to conclude that the negatively assessed profit/loss figure
demonstrates any relative impoverishment.
<P>

(j)	None of the offences was particularly serious.  The prosecutor expressly
challenged this submission and I would uphold the challenge.
 No doubt the
outcome might have been more serious, for example if actual injury had taken
place, but in dealing with preventative
safety measures, exposure to risk
resulting from simple non compliance is  itself serious and in my view cannot
be categorized any
more mildly.
<P>

(k)	Any claim to dismissal pursuant to s 556A of the Crimes Act was disavowed
and Mr Porter realistically acknowledged that fines
should be imposed.  It was
reiterated that the defendant had no prior convictions and the evidence of Mr
Shuster that the defendant
had acted exactly in compliance with the law in 1994
was not contradicted.  Finally attention was directed to an asserted sense of
practical duplication in some of the offences in that they related to identical
goods.  Section 62(4) of the Act which reflects the
flavour of the principles
of totality was referred to.  In the light of my assessment of appropriate
penalty its specific terms do
not need to be applied and I shall limit myself
to giving appropriate indications when imposing the fines.  
<P>

	<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

21	I conclude that the evidence shows that the responses of the defendant were
such that the element usually referred to as "personal
deterrence" would not be
of any great significance.  The offences do however relate to matters of public
safety and the element of
"public deterrence" is of significant concern.  There
should be a clear signal to traders that offences arising out of breaches of
safety requirement will not be lightly tolerated.  Nevertheless in the
particular circumstances of these offences and for the reasons
adumbrated above
the amount of penalty should be tempered but it should be recognized that
considerable leniency has been integrated
into the assessment of amount.  As I
have already mentioned it is necessary to give special account to the consent
of the defendant
to pay the substantial amount representing the whole legal
costs of proceedings brought by the prosecutor.
<P>

	<b>Penalties</b>
<P>

22	I impose the following fines and I add some notations concerning the
assessment of the discrete amounts.
<P>

	<b>First Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Second Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

Both the first and second offences relate to wooden toys.  The defendant has
ceased all trade of such items.
<P>

	<b>Third Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.  
<P>

The neglect to discover the chemical content which included benzine was
particularly significant in the case of an item which required
little attention
to lead to a conclusion that prudence would demand investigation and
examination. 
<P>

	<b>Fourth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.
<P>

	<b>Fifth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

The fourth and fifth offences relate to the same stock discovered in separate
stores on succeeding days.  Qualified by my earlier
remarks about electing to
move into this State to trade, I accept that the defendant marketed these items
in the knowledge that there
was no ban upon them in the States where it had
previously operated namely Victoria and South Australia.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Sixth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.  
<P>

The design of the toy including the potential to launch projectiles is a matter
which adds in my view to culpability when no adequate
testing or inspection is
undertaken.  
<P>

	<b>Seventh Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.
<P>

	<b>Eighth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.
<P>

	<b>Ninth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $4,000.  
<P>

The eighth and ninth offences concern the "Santa Bags".  The need for air holes
in such bags to avoid risk to some of our most vulnerable
population is widely
appreciated.  The description suggests that the bags were likely to come into
the possession of the extremely
young.  I regard it as being just as important
to have adequately supervised and ensured compliance with withdrawal after
attention
was drawn (ninth offence) as the failure to appreciate and act on the
danger.
<P>

	<b>Tenth Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

The elastic straps were most likely to be used by adults.  As only some of the
items were not labelled, the oversight can to an
extent be understood if not
excused.  
<P>

	<b>Eleventh Offence</b>
<P>

The defendant is fined $2,000.  
<P>

As this is the same item as related to the sixth offence being the toy jet
plane which launched projectiles.  It was apparently
stocked in a store prior
to opening and I have taken into account that there are two offences in respect
of the same item and that
there was the infortuitous timing of the
investigation and the opening of the store.
<P>

23	The total of the fines imposed above is $30,000.  I further order the
defendant to pay the prosecutor's costs assessed at $89,772.
 I note that
payment may be enforced in respect of both these amounts pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/" class="autolink_findacts">Fines
Act 1996</a>.
<P>
