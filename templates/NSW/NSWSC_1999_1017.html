<P>

WOOD CJ at CL
<P>

FRIDAY 8TH OCTOBER ortio1999
<P>

<b>PAPADOPOULOS &amp; ANOR v HRISTOFORIDES </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>WOOD CJ at CL</b>:  In 1989 the plaintiffs, Sofia Papapopoulos
and her brother Demetrios Tsesmetzis, purchased a parcel of land known as 72 to
74 Corrimal
Street Wollongong, with an eye to its development for home units.
They entered into a joint venture with the defendant, John Hristoforidis,
also
known as "John Christo", who was a licensed builder by trade.  By July 1991,
the home units were completed.  By this time, however,
there was serious
disharmony within the venture.   In October 1991, the defendant commenced
proceedings to wind up the joint venture
company, leading to the appointment of
a Receiver and Manager, and later of a liquidator.
<P>

2  	Now that the units have all been sold off, the plaintiffs have
brought these proceedings whereby they seek recovery of damages
for negligent
misstatement, and for breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the defendant.
Needless to say, the proceedings have
been hotly contested.
<P>

<b>THE UNDISPUTED FACTS</b>
<P>

3  	Certain facts have been agreed, others have been established from
the documents placed into evidence.  What is not in dispute
is that:
<P>

(a)	On 23 March 1989 the plaintiffs purchased the Corrimal Street properties
for $335,000, of which $155,000 was contributed by
Sophie Papadopoulos on
behalf of herself and her brother, and the balance of which ($180,000) was
borrowed from Mercantile Credits.
<P>

(b)	On 7 June 1989, Development Approval was obtained for the construction of
ten home units on the site.  This DA was  amended
on 16 August 1989, 18
December 1989, 12 February 1990, 30 January 1991, and 10 May 1991.
<P>

(c)	On 17 July 1989 Burgess and Jaye valued the lands for an intending
mortgage, on Mrs. Papadopoulos' instructions, in the sum
of $320,000.
<P>

(d)	On 21 July 1989, the purchase of the lands by the plaintiffs was settled
and a mortgage was given to Mercantile Credits to secure
the loan made by
it.
<P>

(e)	Steps were initiated to convert the titles to the lands from Old System to
Torrens and  Strata title.
<P>

(f)	The plaintiffs' attempts to secure finance for the development were
unsuccessful.
<P>

(g)	The defendant was approached by the plaintiffs, to whom he had been known
for thirty years or so, in about September 1989, with
a view to securing his
assistance with the project.
<P>

(h)	Between September and November 1989 there were a number of discussions
between the plaintiffs and the defendant, which ultimately
led to them entering
into a joint venture to construct and sell the units.  In particular there were
meetings at the City Pacific
International Restaurant, it would seem on 16
September, and at the Elsinor Motor Inn (or Lodge, as it was variously named)
on 23
September, at which the project and the defendant's involvement in it
were discussed.
<P>

(i)	On 14 November 1989, the plaintiffs and the defendant executed a letter of
agreement, under which BCE Constructions Pty Ltd
(BCE) a company beneficially
owned and controlled by the defendant, was appointed as builder for the
venture, at a rate of $50 per
hour plus 7.5% of the cost of construction.  The
agreement recorded, additionally, that the books, invoices and paperwork should
be available to the partnership, at any time, and that the units were to be
sold as soon as possible, and the loan repaid "as a priority".
<P>

(j)	On 28 November 1989, Burgess &amp; Jaye provided a valuation, "for an
intending mortgage to Mercantile Credits under instructions
from J. Christo",
in which the construction costs were estimated in the sum of $1.401m (plus non
construction fees and costs of $45,000),
 and an estimate of the total gross
sales value was given, in a sum of $2m.
<P>

(k)	On 30 November 1989, an application was lodged with the Wollongong City
Council for Building Approval.
<P>

(l)	On 13 February 1990, Building Approval was obtained from the Council.
<P>

(m)	On 6 April 1990, the Defendant obtained a valuation of his home from
Carritt Taylor &amp; Associates Pty Ltd for mortgage purposes,
in the sum of
$320,000.
<P>

(n)	On 23 April 1990 a shelf company, Emery Park Pty Limited (Emery Park) was
acquired, of which the plaintiffs and defendant became
shareholders and
directors.
<P>

(o)	On 4 May 1990, Burgess &amp; Jaye prepared further valuations of the two
Corrimal Street properties in the sums of $165,000
and $175,000
respectively;
<P>

(p)	On 18 May 1990, the plaintiffs entered into a contract for the sale of the
two properties to Emery Park for the amounts recorded
in these valuations.
<P>

(q)	On 18 May 1990, Emery Park entered into a contract to sell the penthouse
unit to Daphne Innes for $470,000.
<P>

(r)	On 23 May 1990, Sophie Papadopoulos and her father entered into an
agreement with Daphne Innes to borrow $140,000 from her,
at an interest rate of
20% per annum, to be secured by a mortgage over the house of the father.
<P>

(s)	On 23 May 1990, Emery Park entered into an agreement with BCE, whereby the
latter agreed, upon the face of the document, to
construct the units for
$1.45m.
<P>

(t)	On 24 May 1990,  Emery Park opened a bank account with the ANZ Bank at its
Earlwood Branch.  Pursuant to an authority signed
by the parties, the defendant
was authorised to sign cheques by himself to an amount of $10,000.  Cheques
over this amount required
the signatures of both the Defendant and the First
Plaintiff.
<P>

(u)	On 24 May 1990, deposits were made to the bank account of Emery Park on
behalf of:
<P>

&#183;	the plaintiffs in the sum of 		$105,000   (Sophie $20,000 and $60,000
and Demetrios $25,000)
<P>

&#183;	the defendant in the sum of 	<u>  $35,000</u>
<P>

$140,000
<P>

(v)	On 31 May 1990, the solicitors for Mercantile Credits confirmed the
availability of a loan to be made to Emery Park in the sum
of $1.63m, to be
disbursed as to $180,000 to pay out the existing mortgage over the premises,
and as to the balance of $1.45m. for
construction of the units.  The conditions
for approval of the finance included a requirement for production of a fixed
price contract
with BCE in a sum not exceeding $1.45m, and for confirmation
that the borrower held the sum of $240,000.
<P>

(w)	On 1 June 1990, the plaintiffs and the defendant executed two documents,
each headed "To Whom it may concern", the first of
which set out the respective
contributions of the partners to the project, which after offsets produced a
working capital of $288,624
as well as the cash outlays required and the
balancing amounts due to them;  and the second of which noted that the
defendant was
to be credited, by way of a contribution to the joint venture,
with the sum of $53,976 to cover his wages, plus 7.5%, plus operating
expenses
to 1 June 1990, together with a further sum of $70,000 as a fee for making his
home available, by way of security for the
Mercantile Credits loan.  It also
noted that he was to receive vehicle expenses for one year referable to a
nominated utility.
<P>

(x)	The sum of $53,976 was calculated by the defendant so as to include the
following components:
<P>

Wages 8/1/90 to 1/6/90 @ $2,000 per week		$42,000
<P>

Interest @ 17.5%						    1,410
<P>

Expenses (as recorded in the yellow book)		    6,538
<P>

Interest $ 17.5%							  ___<u>262</u>
<P>

   50,210
<P>

7.5% commission						<u>      3,766</u>
<P>

									  $53,976
<P>

(y)	The "loan fee" was calculated upon the basis that the value of the
defendant's home was tied up for 1.5 years, and should attract
interest at 17%
per annum, against which there should be an offset for rent:
<P>

$320,00 x 3/2 x 17/100			=	  $81,600
<P>

less rent (at $644 per month)		<u>$11,600</u>
<P>

								$70,000
<P>

(z)	At the same time a similar exercise was undertaken in relation to the first
plaintiff, to calculate the monies that she had
paid out to that date in
respect of the properties.  The amount struck, as drawn from a brown book kept
by her and then carried over
to the yellow book, in which the records for the
venture were effectively kept by the defendant, was $204,458, which was then
apportioned
equally between the plaintiffs in the sum of $102,230.
<P>

(ba)	On 4 June 1990, the defendant  deposited $13,624 to the Emery Park bank
account.
<P>

(bb)	On 4 July 1990, Emery Park entered into an agreement with the defendant
and his wife whereby, in consideration of them providing
security for the
Mercantile Credits loan, it agreed to complete the sale of the units by the end
of December 1991, to enter into
a program for their auction and if necessary to
reduce the sale prices sufficiently so as to pay out the loan by 31 December
1991.
<P>

(bc)	On 17 July 1990 further deposits were made to Emery Park's bank account as
follows:
<P>

&#183;	the first plaintiff in the sum of	$40,000  (10,000 and $30,000)
<P>

&#183;	the defendant in the sum of 	$20,000
<P>

(bd)	On 25 July 1990, Burgess &amp; Jaye provided a further valuation report as
to the construction costs in the sum of $1.446m,
of which they assessed the
value of work to date in the sum of $196,700, the cost to complete being
$1,249,300.  Similar valuations
were provided at intervals thereafter, against
which draw downs were progressively made to meet the costs of construction and
the
servicing of the interest debt.
<P>

(be)	On 31 July 1990, the plaintiffs executed a transfer of the land to Emery
Park for a total consideration of $340,000, which
was registered on 22 August
1990.
<P>

(bf)	On 1 August 1990, Emery Park executed a mortgage in favour of Mercantile
Credits to secure a borrowing of $1.63m.
<P>

(bg)	On the same date the defendant and his wife executed a second mortgage
over their home by way of further security for the Mercantile
Credits loan.
<P>

(bh)	From about this time construction of the units commenced, following
demolition of the cottages and excavation of the site.
 Subsequently, and
before completion of the building, the defendant began to advertise the units
for sale.  It would seem that the
first such advertisement was placed in
September 1990.
<P>

(bj )	On 9 October 1990, Richardson &amp; Wrench provided a report to the
defendant of suggested selling prices for the units, in
a total of $1,502,600
(excluding the penthouse).
<P>

(bk)	On 4 March 1991, Peter Fitzgerald Real Estate wrote to the solicitors for
Emery Park advising that Unit 3 had been sold for
$175,000.
<P>

(bl)	On 2 May 1991, a contract for sale of this unit was exchanged, recording a
sale price of $220,000 subject to reduction to $125,000
in the event of
settlement prior to 31 August 1991;
<P>

(bm)	On 7 May 1991, BCE obtained a guarantee from the ANZ Bank in the sum of
$50,000 in favour of the Wollongong City Council, such
guarantee being required
against release of the Strata Plan.
<P>

(bn)	On 9 May 1991, BCE lodged $50,000 with the ANZ Bank, in its name, by way
of a term deposit.
<P>

(bo)	On 14 June 1991, Peter Fitzgerald Real Estate provided a pricing agenda
for the units excluding the penthouse, in the sum of
 $1.577m.
<P>

(bp)	On 20 June 1991, the Council advised that the Strata Plan had been
registered.
<P>

(bq)	By about July 1991, construction of the units was completed, for a total
cost initially calculated by Mr. Woodgate to be $1,580,774
(including
commission of $110,286 at 7.5%), but later reduced by $3,150 to allow for an
adjustment downwards of the commission. The
calculation of Mr. Rees, based on
the yellow book, was $1,562,452.  The sales of the ten units achieved, it would
seem, a gross return
of $2,002,000 (ie exclusive of commission, advertising,
holding and legal costs).
<P>

(br)	On 3 July 1991, the sale of Unit 3 was settled, according to the
settlement statement for a price of $125,000 but according
to the memorandum of
transfer executed that date for a consideration of $220,000.
<P>

(bs)	On 10July 1991, the sale to Daphne Innes was settled.
<P>

(bt)	On 1 August 1991, the bank account of Emery Park went into overdraft, and
at the request of the defendant, although it would
seem without reference to
the plaintiffs, the limit was from time to time increased.
<P>

(bu)	On 19 August 1991, the defendant wrote to the plaintiffs requesting the
payment of construction accounts in the sum of $15,283.51.
<P>

(bv)	On 24 August 1991, the second plaintiff sent a demand to the defendant to
produce the plans, specifications, invoices, cheques
and correspondence
relating to the venture.
<P>

(bw)	On 4 September 1991 a meeting of Directors of Emery Park was held, on the
requisition of the Second Plaintiff.  The defendant
refused the request which
had been made to him to produce the financial records in respect of the
venture, for the stated reason
that he did not trust the other directors.  He
did, however, produce some unpaid invoices.  "Resolutions" were then passed by
the
plaintiffs to the effect that all future sales required their approval,
that a new bank account be opened for which the plaintiffs
were to be the
signatories, that a solicitor, Mr. Walter, and an accountant, Mr. Hackleton, be
appointed to inquire into the venture,
and that the payment of outstanding
accounts be held in abeyance.
<P>

(bx)	On or about 26 September 1991, the defendant issued a notice of demand
upon Emery Park pursuant to S460 of the Corporations
Law (as it then provided)
in respect of the contributions of $68,624 ($35,000, $13,624 and $20,000 noted
above) made by him to the
venture, and deposited into Emery Park's bank
account, which were said to be "funds advanced ... pursuant to a shareholders'
agreement".
<P>

(by)	On 15 October 1991, an accountant, Andrew Chiu of Joseph Yuen Pty Ltd,
advised the defendant that Emery Park had been trading
at a loss and was
insolvent.
<P>

(bz)	On 17 October 1991, the Defendant filed a summons in the Equity Division
of the Supreme Court for an order that Emery Park
be wound up.
<P>

(ca)	On 25 October 1991, Mr. Hackleton delivered to Mr. Walters a report on the
financial affairs of Emery Park.
<P>

(cb)	On 30 October 1991, the Court appointed a receiver and manager to Emery
Park .
<P>

(cc)	On 18 March 1992, a quantity surveyor, Trevor Hilaire prepared an estimate
of the reasonable costs required to construct the
units in accordance with the
Council approved plans, based on construction during the period June 1990 to
June 1991, in the sum of
$1,635,797, adjusted down to $1,567,797, to take into
account deviations from the approved drawings.  Letters of this date including
a costs schedule were sent to "<i>Mrs. S. Papadopoulos and Mr. J Christo, Cnr
of Carters Lane and Towradgi Road, Towradgi</i>".  The estimate was exclusive
of any project management fee and of all acquisition, legal and finance
costs.
<P>

(cd)	On 24 March 1993, a meeting was held with Mr. Hilaire at the office of the
accountant at which the report was discussed.
<P>

(ce)	On 25 March 1993, Mr. Hilaire wrote to the First Plaintiff and "Mr. J.
Christo" stating that his company was not prepared to
issue a report disclosing
a reasonable construction cost for less than $1m.
<P>

(cf)	On 25 March 1992, the plaintiffs' solicitors wrote to Mr. Hilaire
expressing dissatisfaction with the report and  advising
that the cheque for
part payment of his fees that had been earlier provided was to be stopped.
<P>

(cg)	On 2 June 1992, Mr. Hilaire commenced proceedings in the Local Court for
recovery of the fees incurred in preparing the report
and later obtained a
default judgment for the sum of $3,575.69.
<P>

(ch)	On 26 October 1992, the Supreme Court appointed a liquidator to Emery
Park.
<P>

(ci)	On 27 December 1994, the defendant sent a letter to the Liquidator of
Emery Park noting that while the asking price for Unit
3, was $220,000 "the
agreement was that the unit would be sold to David at the discounted price of
$175,000" which was to be paid
in the following way:
<P>

$125,000 which is referred to as the settlement funds, to Esanda (formerly
Mercantile Credits.
<P>

$50,000 which was used to issue a bank guarantee to Wollongong Council...."
<P>

(cj)	The letter further advised that the $50,000 plus accrued interest was used
to pay:
<P>

$24,176.36 to BBC Hardware
<P>

$19,800.00 to Dave's Plumbing Service
<P>

$7,045.41	to Emery Park
<P>

(ck)	Supporting documentary records were identified in respect of those
payments which confirmed that the sum of $50,520.56  was
paid into BCE's
account, on maturity of the deposit, on 23 July 1991, and that the sums
mentioned above were paid out of that account
between 23 July and 31 July.
<P>

(cl)	In September 1995, the plaintiffs commenced these proceedings.
<P>

(cm)	On 26 November 1996, the Liquidator provided a final report showing a
balance of $23,030 which was applied against the Liquidator's
costs incurred in
the winding up of $92,808, the balance being written off.
<P>

(cn)	As a result of the interest and holding costs, the costs involved in the
repair and sale of the units, and the costs of the
receivership and
liquidation, there was no return to the partners on account of their capital
contributions, let alone any component
for profit in relation to the venture.
The only party to reap any actual benefit was the defendant, so far as he, or
BCE, received
remuneration  assessed by Mr. Woodgate to have been in the order
of $233,347, in respect of the construction works.  The net result
to the
plaintiffs was the loss of the lands and of the monies they had contributed.
<P>

(co)	A further valuation of the lands, made by Terence Wetherall, was tendered,
which placed a market value upon them as undeveloped
lands but with development
and building approval for ten units, as at May 1997, in the sum of $420,000.
<P>

<b>THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM</b>
<P>

4  	The plaintiffs' claim was pursued on several bases.
<P>

<b>Negligent Misstatement</b>
<P>

5  	The duty of care in relation to misstatements sounding in
economic loss has its genesis in the decisions in <u>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd
v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) AC 465</a>;  <u>Mutual Life &amp; Citizens

162 CLR 340</a>, and it is in reliance upon the statements of principle there
expressed, that the plaintiffs' claim , in this respect, is pursued.
 Of
particular relevance is the passage in the joint judgment of Gibbs CJ, Mason,
Wilson and Dawson JJ at 356-357.
<P>

"In <u>Evatt</u> and <u>Shaddock</u> the misstatement on which the plaintiff
relied was made in response to a request - in the case of <u>Evatt</u> for
information and advice, and in the case of <u>Shaddock</u> for information
alone, although the distinction between information and advice is an
unnecessary and often difficult one to draw:
....  (65)But there is no
convincing reason for confining the liability to instances of negligent
misstatement made by way of response
to a request by the plaintiff for
information or advice.  The existence of an antecedent request for information
or advice certainly
assists in demonstrating reliance, which is a cornerstone
of liability for negligent misstatement. However, such a request is by
no means
essential, though it has been suggested that instances of liability for
misstatement volunteered negligently will be "rare":
...The maker of a
statement may come under a duty to take care through a combination of
circumstances or in various ways, in the
absence of a request by the recipient.
The author, though volunteering information or advice, may be known to possess,
or profess
to possess, skill and competence in the area which is the subject of
the communication.  He may warrant the correctness of what he
says or assume
responsibility for its correctness.  He may invite the recipient to act on the
basis of the information or advice,
or intend to induce the recipient to act in
a particular way.  He may actually have an interest in the recipient so
acting."
<P>

6  	Their Honours referred to the appellants' submission to the
effect that:
<P>

".... where A engages in conduct which is intended to cause B or a class of
persons to act in a particular manner, A comes under
a duty of care to B or any
member of the class who is induced to act in that manner.  Alternatively the
appellants submit that A
comes under a duty of care where he has an interest in
inducing such action."
<P>

7  	The deficiency in the first submission, their Honours said (at
358):
<P>

"... may be expressed by saying that it is necessary not only that A intends
that B or members of a class of persons should act
or refrain from acting in a
particular way, but also that A makes the statement with the intention of
inducing B or members of that
class, in reliance on the statement, to act or
refrain from acting in the particular way, in circumstances where A should
realize
that economic loss may be suffered if the statement is not true. In
cases where the defendant intends the statement to operate as
a direct
inducement to action, the reasonableness of the reliance will not be a critical
factor, although in other cases the defendant's
appreciation of the
reasonableness of reliance will be relevant."
<P>

8  	As to the alternative way in which the appellants put their case,
their Honours observed:
<P>

"The appellants' alternative proposition derives from the American
<i>Restatement of the Law of Torts</i> (2d) 552, which speaks of the liability
of a person who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in
any other
transaction in which he has a <i>pecuniary</i> interest, supplies
false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,
for pecuniary loss caused to them
by their justifiable reliance on the
information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining
or communicating
the information."
<P>

9  	Their Honours noted, in relation to this leg of the argument,
that the general interest which a local authority had in promoting
or
encouraging development within its area, would not normally be classed as a
"pecuniary interest";  and hence would not be enough
to support the existence
of a duty of care in relation to statements made in development plans.  Its
applicability otherwise was
not the subject of comment.
<P>

10  	It followed then, their Honours said, in relation to the matter
on appeal, that:
<P>

"...if the appellants' case is to succeed they must establish at least, amongst
other things, (1) that the alleged representation
was made, and (2) that the
Authority and the Council made the representation with the intention of
inducing members of the class
of developers to act in reliance on the
representation."
<P>

11  	Brennan J (as he then was) stated the relevant principle (at
372) after referring to the judgment of Barwick CJ in <u>Mutual Life &amp;
Citizens Assurance Co v Evatt</u> in the following terms:
<P>

"Where a representor gives information or advice on a serious or business
matter, intending thereby to induce the representee to
act on it, the
representor is under a duty of care in giving that advice or information if
three conditions are satisfied.  First
(corresponding with the first condition
expressed by Barwick CJ), if the representor realises or ought to realise that
the representee
will trust in his especial competence to give that information
or advice;  second, (corresponding with the third condition), if it
would be
reasonable for the representee to accept and rely on that information or
advice;  and third (applying the underlying principle
of the law of
negligence), if it is reasonably foreseeable that the representee is likely to
suffer loss should the information turn
out to be incorrect or the advice turn
out to be unsound."
<P>

12  	Although the law of negligence has moved on considerably since
these decisions, and there has been a questioning of the extent
to which
notions of foreseeability, proximity and general reliance provide the
touchstone for, or the universal identifier of, the
existence of a duty of care
in decisions such as <u>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd</u>

338</a>, I do not see these decisions as limiting the principles identified in
<u>San Sebastian</u>. 
<P>

13  	In this regard, it may be noted that <u>in Pyrenees Shire
Council</u>, Gummow J observed, at 385-386:
<P>

"... the primary significance of reliance is in cases of alleged negligent
provision of advice or information where reliance aids
the formulation of a
duty of care and detrimental reliance enters into the question of causation of
loss".
<P>

14  	Although not referred to in argument, the High Court returned to
the subject of economic loss in <u>Perre v Apand Pty Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20164%20ALR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 164 ALR
606.</a>  The members of the Court did not speak with one voice as to the
circumstances in which a duty of care arises in this context, agreeing
however, that upon the facts of the case on appeal, a duty was owed.  McHugh J
said (at 76) that:
<P>

"... the differing views of the members of this Court in the present case
suggest that the search for a unifying element (in determining
the duty of care
question) may be a long one."
<P>

15  	The existence of the divergent views seen in this appeal leaves
a Judge, at first instance, in some difficulty.  So far as
I can determine the
relevant principles were stated as follows:
<P>

Gleeson CJ:
<P>

"[7]	If there once was a bright line rule which absolutely prevented
recognition of a duty of care in any case where the negligent
conduct of one
person caused financial loss to another, not associated with injury to the
other's person or property, and which assigned
claims to recover such loss to
the field of contract rather than tort, the line gave way in an area where
there is a clear potential
for carelessness to cause financial harm:  negligent
misstatements made to a person who, to the  knowledge of the maker of the
statement,
relies upon the advice or information provided.  However, there is
no convincing reason why conveying advice or information should
be treated as
the solitary exception to an otherwise absolute exclusionary rule.
<P>

[10]	In <u>Caparo</u>, Lord Oliver emphasised that, in this field of discourse,
the mere foreseeabillity of possible damage, without some further control
(which he summarised as `proximity', after explaining what he meant by that
term) would not be useful as the test of liability. 
At the same time, however,
his Lordship made it clear that `in some cases the degree of foreseeability is
such that it is from that
alone that the requisite proximity can be deduced'.
In relation to the giving of advice or information, questions of reliance and
actual foresight of the possibility of harm (or, what is the same thing, the
foresight that a reasonable person would have) are closely
related.  Moreover,
knowledge (actual, or that which a reasonable person would have) of an
individual, or an ascertainable class
of persons, who is or are reliant, and
therefore vulnerable, is a significant factor in establishing a duty of
care."
<P>

Gaudron J:
<P>

"[27]	It is clear that foreseeability does not, of itself, suffice to render a
defendant liable for negligently inflicted economic
loss.  This
notwithstanding, the notion of proximity, which has generally been adopted by
this court to describe the special feature
or features that attract a duty of
care in economic loss cases, has been criticised as being incapable of
constituting a universal
criterion of liability and, also, as having only
limited utility in determining whether there exists a duty of care in a
particular
case.  It may well be that, at this stage, the notion of proximity
can serve no purpose beyond signifying that it is necessary to
identify a
factor or factors of special significance in addition to the foreseeability of
harm before the law will impose liability
for the negligent infliction of
economic loss.
<P>

[42]	In my  view, where a person knows or ought to know that his or her acts or
omissions may cause the loss or impairment of legal
rights possessed, enjoyed
or exercised by another, whether as an individual or as a member of a class,
and that that latter person
is in no position to protect his or her own
interests, there is a relationship such that the law should impose a duty of
care on
the former to take reasonable steps to avoid a foreseeable risk of
economic loss resulting from the loss or impairment of those rights."
<P>

McHugh J:
<P>

"[101]	Until 1963, the almost universal rule was that, absent contract or
fiduciary relationship, a person owed no duty to avoid
causing economic loss to
another person, and although no longer a universal rule, no duty is the general
rule. Judges and academic
commentators have subjected  this exclusionary rule
to an intense scrutiny which has yielded a broad consensus on the rationale for
the rule.  They generally agree that the theoretical underpinnings of the
exclusionary rule are the need to avoid imposing indeterminate
liability and
the need to avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the freedom of individuals
to protect or pursue their own legitimate
social and business interests without
the need to be concerned with other persons' interests.
<P>

[103]	Nevertheless, when a court is satisfied that the economic loss suffered
by the plaintiff was reasonable foreseeable by the
defendant, that no question
of indeterminacy of liability arises and that the defendant was not
legitimately protecting or pursuing
his or her social or business interests, it
will often accord with community standards and the goals of negligence law, as
an instrument
of corrective justice, to hold that the defendant should have had
the plaintiff's interests in mind when engaging or refusing to
engage in a
particular course of conduct.  However, the common law in its desire to give
effect to the autonomy of each individual
does not generally require a person
to act as if he or she were `my brother's keeper'.  That is particularly so
when the defendant
would have to take affirmative action to save a person from
suffering harm.
<P>

[104]	What is likely to be decisive, and always of relevance, in determining
whether a duty of care is owed is the answer to the
question, "how vulnerable
was the plaintiff to incurring loss by reason of the defendant's conduct?"   So
also is the actual knowledge
of the defendant concerning that risk and its
magnitude. If no question of indeterminate liability is present and the
defendant,
having no legitimate interest to pursue, is aware that his or her
conduct will cause economic loss to persons who are not easily
able to protect
themselves against that loss, it seems to accord with current community
standards in most, if not all, cases to require
the defendant to have the
interests of those persons in mind before he or she embarks on that
conduct."
<P>

Gummow J:
<P>

"[172]	The decision of this court in <u>Caltex Oil</u> is authority at least
for the proposition that, in a case such as the present, one does not begin
with an absolute rule that damages
in negligence are irrecoverable in respect
of economic loss which is not consequential upon injury to person or property.
The same
may be said of more recent decisions of this court and the House of
Lords, as well as of the Supreme Court of Canada and the New
Zealand Court of
Appeal.
<P>

[200]	The emergence of a coherent body of precedents will be impeded, not
assisted, by the imposition of a fixed system of categories
in which damages in
negligence for economic loss may be recovered.  In Canada, it appears that what
is identified as `contractual
relational economic loss' is recoverable only in
special circumstances and these can be defined by reference to three
categories.
 The first is whether the claimant has a possessory or proprietary
interest in the damaged property;  the second is the general average
cases in
shipping law;  and the third comprises cases where the relationship between the
claimant and the property owner constitutes
a joint venture.  However, it has
been necessary to add that the categories are not closed...." 
<P>

[201]	I prefer the approach taken by Stephen J in <u>Caltex Oil.</u> His Honour
isolated a number of `salient features' which combined to constitute a
sufficiently close relationship to give rise to
a duty of care owed to Caltex
for breach of which it might recover its purely economic loss.  In <u>Hill v
Van Erp</u> and <u>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</u> I favoured a similar
approach, with allowance for the operation of appropriate `control mechanisms'.
In those two cases, the result
was to sustain the existence of a duty of
care.
<P>

Kirby J:
<P>

"[259]	The foregoing analysis brings me to the third (of the three options
identified by his Honour in para 247 of his reasons)
...  It was expressed in
my reasons in <u>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</u>.  As an approach or
methodology for deciding whether a legal duty of care in negligence exists, I
suggested that the decision-maker
must ask three questions:
<P>

1.	Was it reasonably foreseeable to the alleged wrongdoer that particular
conduct or an omission on its part would be likely to
cause harm to persons who
have suffered damage or a person in the same position?
<P>

2.	Does there exist between the alleged wrongdoer and such a person a
relationship characterised by the law as one of `proximity'
or
`neighbourhood'?
<P>

3.	If so, is it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of
a given scope upon the alleged wrongdoer for the
benefit of such a person?
<P>

[269]	Even in England, since <u>Hedley Byrne</u>, an increasing number of
judges have begun to reconceptualise negligence claims involving pure economic
loss in terms of the general
approach established by <u>Caparo</u> which I
followed in <u>Pyrenees</u>.  Thus in <u>Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc</u>
Lord Lowry considered the question of whether a legal duty of care existed in
negligence in that case by reference to the foreseeability
and proximity tests.
He then rejected the defendant's argument that public policy required that
recovery be denied:
<P>

`This argument falls to be considered on the assumption that, but for the
overriding effect of public policy, a plaintiff who is
in the necessary
proximate relation to a defendant will be entitled to succeed in negligence if
he proves his case. To assess the
validity of the argument entails not the
resolution of a point of law but a balancing of moral and practical arguments.
This exercise
could no doubt produce different answers but, for my own part, I
come down decisively on the side of the plaintiff'.
<P>

[288]	In this area of the law, there has been a candour about the influence of
legal policy which surprises some commentators, and
even some judges, used to
the pretence that the law provides for every problem a simple rule yielding an
unarguable outcome.  In
this field of negligence law, at least, it does not.
This is not the time to return to pretended classifications, narrow
`exceptions',
newly invented `principles' or rules derived from the apparent
justice of a hard case, or unconceptual categories.  The law of negligence
in
cases of claims for pure economic loss is completely unsatisfactory.  This
court's duty is not to search for more `rules' which
will last a moment but
fail to afford more than fleeting and particular guidance as new and different
circumstances present themselves
for decision. Our duty is to afford an
approach or methodology which is universal to the tort of negligence and
appropriate to the
particular sub-category of negligence where the breach in
question has occasioned pure economic loss.  Only the <u>Caparo</u> formulation
achieves that goal.  We should adopt it.  In doing so we will be taking no bold
step.  The methodology or its variants
are, as I have shown, already applied in
England, New Zealand and Canada - the countries of the common law whose legal
systems most
closely approximate that of Australia. Striking out with our own
new `principles' is in my view quite the wrong way to go.  It is
doomed to
fail."
<P>

Hayne J:
<P>

"[333]	It is because of the lack of definition of terms like `proximity' and
`fairness' that it has been said that the law in this
area should develop
incrementally.  And so it must for as long as no unifying principle emerges.
But that is far from saying that
the law should develop without explicit
recognition of the factors that are considered important in deciding whether
there is a duty
to take care to avoid pure economic loss.  The identification
of those factors is essential to any ordered development of the law
in this
area.  In particular, if the matter were to be described in terms of whether to
impose a duty would be `fair, just and reasonable'
it is essential to identify
what are the factors that lead to the application of these epithets.  Without
that identification the
words state no principle, only a qualitative
description of the intended result of any and every application of law.
<P>

334	It is not enough to say that compensating those who are injured, deterring
wrongdoing or spreading loss are values that are
reflected in the law of
negligence.  They may be.  But these do not assist in deciding whether a duty
of care exists.  They do not
assist because each of them is a corollary of a
finding that a duty does exist and none, therefore, helps to say whether a duty
<i>should</i> be found to exist.  Equally, references to the possibility that
there are many persons in the same position as a particular plaintiff,
or that
the losses sustained by a plaintiff and others in like case are very large, do
not help any more than do references to floodgates
or the like.
<P>

[335]As I have said, the search for a control mechanism in addition to
foreseeability is driven by at least two considerations -
the desire to avoid
indeterminate liability and the concern not to establish a rule that will
render `ordinary' business conduct
tortious.  If those are the concerns, then
the criterion or criteria devised by the courts should address them directly
rather than
obscure their significance behind expressions such as `fair, just
and reasonable'.  It may be that there are additional considerations
that may
have to be taken into account as this area of law develops but for present
purposes the two that I have mentioned are critical:
 whether the liability is
indeterminate and whether the liability is consistent with basic assumptions
about the economy in which
the conduct takes place."
<P>

Callinan J:
<P>

"[402]	The cases subsequent to <u>Caltex</u> in this country show that all
judges are united in their opinions that, for policy reasons, there is a need
for a control mechanism
to limit the availability of relief for pure economic
loss so that commerce, providers of services, courts and society generally
will
not have to bear the burden and uncertainty of incalculable claims by a mass of
people whose identity or very existence may
be unknown to the defendant. It is
not surprising, having regard to the different factual situations in which pure
economic loss
has been suffered and will no doubt be suffered in the future,
and the frank judicial acknowledgments that have been made of the
relevance of
public policy and social issues, that the principles governing or controlling
the mechanisms to limit liability have
not always been stated identically.
<P>

[404]	In her essay `Duty of Care Factors: a Selection from the Judicial Menus',
Professor Stapleton discusses some of the difficulties
which have confronted
the courts in trying to find, and express one clear principle which judges may
readily apply in cases of pure
economic loss.  There is much I think to commend
her view that:
<P>

`while the listing of these judicial menus of sound factors relevant to the
duty issue help unmask  the substantive determinations
being made by judges in
this field, they cannot operate as some sort of mechanical guide as to how a
novel case will be decided in
the future ... (A)t the end of the day, even if
judges agree on the relevant factors to be weighed in the individual case,
different
judges may well place different weight on competing factors and do so
quite reasonably.'
<P>

It should be made clear, however, that the determination of a claim for pure
economic loss is not a merely discretionary matter;
 it requires the
application of the principles stated in <u>Caltex</u> and the subsequent cases
in this court to the various factual situations as they arise in the courts.
<P>

[405]	And it must be accepted that this is an area of the law in which the
courts should move incrementally and very cautiously
indeed.  It is not yet
possible to identify a bright line of demarcation between those cases of pure
economic loss in which damages
are recoverable and those in which they are not.
The law is still developing in the somewhat piecemeal fashion that Stephen J
predicted
in <u>Caltex</u>:
<P>

`As the body of precedent accumulates some general area of demarcation between
what is and is not a sufficient degree of proximity
in any particular class of
case of pure economic loss will no doubt emerge;  but its emergence neither can
be, nor should it be,
other than as a reflection of the piecemeal conclusions
arrived at in precedent cases.'
<P>

[406]	I turn now to a consideration of the factors which in combination I think
relevant in this case and which establish a sufficient
degree of proximity,
foreseeability, a special relationship, determinacy of a relatively small
class, a large measure of control
on the part of the respondent, and special
circumstances justifying the compensation of the appellants for their
losses."
<P>

16  	The plaintiffs pursued their claim upon the basis that the
defendant was negligent in relation to the advice, given to them
in September
1989, concerning the construction costs and return from the project
(specifically in not making proper investigations
into those costs or into the
value of the units) and in not bringing to their attention the November 1989
valuation, before they
became finally committed to the project. In this regard
they placed particular reliance upon the decision of Casey J in <u>J &amp; C
Abrams Ltd v Ancliffe</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%202%20NZLR%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 2 NZLR 421</a>, in which a comparable duty of care
was found to have existed.
<P>

17  	The following factors may, in my view, properly be taken into
account in determining whether a duty of care of the kind asserted,
arose in
the present case:
<P>

&#183;	the existence of a joint venture between the parties;
<P>

&#183;	the experience of the defendant as an engineer, builder and
developer;
<P>

&#183;	the comparative lack of experience of the plaintiffs in the development
of land;
<P>

&#183;	the fact that the plaintiffs sought and obtained from the defendant an
estimate of the construction costs (the terms of which
were in dispute) before
deciding to go ahead with the venture;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	the significance for the joint venture in terms of its profitability,
and for the parties in terms of the financial contribution
they made, of the
construction costs and sales returns;
<P>

&#183;	the fact that the defendant was effectively in control of the project,
from the time a decision was made to proceed with
it.
<P>

18  	The plaintiffs additionally relied upon a submission to the
effect that the defendant gave them a `guarantee' as to the construction
cost
and as to their anticipated net return.  As I do not accept their evidence in
this regard, I have excluded it from the considerations
relevant to the
existence of a duty of care.  Otherwise, it appears to me that the
circumstances identified were sufficient to give
rise to a duty of care, in
relation to the provision of any advice as to the construction costs and sales
returns.  Clearly, the
possibility of loss, in the event of the information
being incorrect, was foreseeable.   Equally clearly, the relationship was one
of potential vulnerability and of reliance on the part of the plaintiffs.
Moreover, the case is not one of indeterminate liability,
such that policy or
other considerations should intervene to exclude liability.
<P>

19  	In my view, the duty owed was properly to be considered as a
continuing duty such that, in the event of it becoming apparent
that any
information previously supplied concerning construction costs or sales values
was incorrect, then that fact should have
been drawn to the notice of the
plaintiffs.  
<P>

20  	To the question of breach of the tortious duty I shall
return.
<P>

<b>Fiduciary Relationship</b>
<P>

21  	The plaintiffs' claim in this regard was pursued upon the basis
that the existence of a joint venture, or partnership, between
the parties,
gave rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the defendant, requiring the
utmost candour and honesty on his part in
his dealings with them.  This, it was
submitted, extended to any statements made in relation to the venture, to the
disclosure of
any adverse circumstances or of any change in relation to
important information concerning the viability of the venture, that came
to
light; and to any abuse of his position so as to acquire a personal gain (other
than proper payment for services rendered in relation
to the construction of
the units). 
<P>

22  	More specifically, it was submitted that the duty resting upon
the defendant was one:
<P>

&#183;	to act bona fide in the interest of the plaintiffs as a whole;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	to exercise his powers as a joint venture partner for the purpose for
which they were conferred and not for any collateral
or improper purpose;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	to avoid being placed in a position of conflict of interest;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	to disclose to the joint venture partners the costs of construction and
any variation therefrom during the progress of construction;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	to disclose to the joint venture partners variations to the estimated
total sales value of home units.
<P>

23  	The breach of this duty arose, so it was submitted, in not
disclosing the Burgess and Jaye valuation of November 1989 to the
plaintiffs,
and in pointing out the differences that it revealed in the construction costs
and sales values that had  previously
been advised to them.  The exercise of
the defendant's power in remaining silent in this regard, it was submitted, was
for a collateral
or improper purpose, in that it permitted him, or the company
of which he was the owner and controller, to receive the wages and
the
percentage of construction costs that were generated once the venture continued
(and which would not have been earned had the
valuation been disclosed).
<P>

24  	In support of the submission that the defendant stood in a
fiduciary relationship to the plaintiffs and owed the duties outlined
above,
reliance was placed on the judgment of Einstein J in <u>Schipp v Cameron and
Ors</u> 9 July 1998 unreported, at paras 695 to 718.   There his Honour applied
a number of observations in the authorities, pertinent to
situations where the
parties had treated together, both before and after entering into a joint
business relationship.  They included
the observations of Mason J in <u>
Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR
41</a> at 96-97:
<P>

"The accepted fiduciary relationships are sometimes referred to as
relationships of trust and confidence or confidential relations

Boardman)</u> viz, trustee and beneficiary agent, and principal, solicitor and

critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or
agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests
of another person in the
exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other
person in a legal or practical
sense.  The relationship between the parties is
therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the
power
or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly
vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position."
<P>

25  	As Brennan J put it in <u>Wik Peoples v Queensland</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20187%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996)
187 CLR 1</a> at 95 to 96, to establish a fiduciary duty:
<P>

"It is necessary to identify some action or function the doing or performance
of which attracts the supposed fiduciary duty to be
observed.  The doing of the
action or the performance of the function must be capable of affecting the
interests of the beneficiary
and the fiduciary must have so acted that it is
reasonable for the beneficiary to believe and expect that the fiduciary will
act
in the interests of the beneficiary (or, in the case of a partnership or
joint venture, in the common interest of the beneficiary
and fiduciary to the
exclusion of the interest of any other person or the separate interest of the
beneficiary."
<P>

26  	In <u>United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 1</a>, Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ observed, in their joint
judgment, at 11:
<P>

"...whether or not the relationship between joint venturers is fiduciary will
depend upon the form which the particular joint venture
takes and upon the
content of the obligations which the parties to it have undertaken. If the
joint venture takes the form of a partnership,
the fact that it is confined to
one joint undertaking as distinct from being a continuing relationship will not
prevent the relationship
between the joint venturers from being a fiduciary
one.  In such a case, the joint venturers will be under fiduciary duties to one
another, including fiduciary duties in relation to property the subject of the
joint venture, which are the ordinary incidents of
the partnership
relationship, though those fiduciary duties will be moulded to the character of
the particular relationship: see,
generally, <u>Birtchnell v Equity Trustees,
Executors Agency Co. Ltd </u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1929/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2042%20CLR%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 42 CLR 384</a> at pp 407-409."
<P>

Their Honours continued, at 12:
<P>

"A fiduciary relationship can arise and fiduciary duties can exist between
parties who have not reached, and who may never reach,
agreement upon the
consensual terms which are to govern the arrangement between them. In
particular, a fiduciary relationship with
attendant fiduciary obligations may,
and ordinarily will, exist between prospective partners who have embarked upon
the conduct of
the partnership business or venture before the precise terms of
any partnership agreement have been settled.  Indeed, in such circumstances,
the mutual confidence and trust which underlie most consensual fiduciary
relationships are likely to be more readily apparent than
in the case where
mutual rights and obligations have been expressly defined in some formal
agreement.  Likewise, the relationship
between prospective partners or
participants in a proposed partnership to carry out a single joint undertaking
or endeavour will
ordinary be fiduciary if the prospective partners have
reached an informal arrangement to assume such a relationship and have
proceeded
to take steps involved in its establishment or implementation.
<P>

Dawson J, in the same case, said, at 16:
<P>

"Although the relationship between participants in a joint venture which is not
a partnership will be governed by the particular
contract rather than extrinsic
principles of law, the relationship may nevertheless be a fiduciary one if the
necessary confidence
is reposed by the participants in one another.  Of course,
in a partnership the parties are agents for each other and this may constitute
a separate reason for the fiduciary character of a partnership.  There may be
no such agency between participants in a joint venture,
but, as Dixon J pointed
out in <u>Birtchnell v Equity Trustees, Executors &amp; Agency Co. Ltd</u> even
in a partnership it is really the mutual confidence between partners which
imposes fiduciary duties upon them and the same confidence
may, in appropriate
circumstances, be found  to exist between participants in a joint venture.
<P>

The only other thing which I wish to add is that in my view it is quite clear
that a fiduciary relationship may arise during negotiations
for a partnership
or, for that matter, a joint venture, before any partnership or joint venture
agreement has been finally concluded
if the parties have acted upon the
proposed agreement as they had in this case. Whilst a concluded agreement may
establish a relationship
of confidence, it is nevertheless the relationship
itself which gives rise to fiduciary obligations.  That relationship may arise
from the circumstances leading to the final agreement as much as from the fact
of final agreement itself."
<P>

27  	It was the conclusion of Einstein J, in <u>Schipp</u> at par
707, with which I respectfully agree, that:
<P>

"The principle appears to be that a Court will find that a fiduciary
relationship existed between the parties to a joint venture
when it is
analogous to a partnership".
<P>

So it was that in <u>United Dominion Corporation</u> a joint venture agreement
for the development of a parcel of land was held analogous to a partnership,
and that the relationship
between the parties was fiduciary in character.
<P>

28  	The present case, upon the facts outline above, is such a case
in my view. However, even if I am incorrect in concluding that
it was an
arrangement analogous to a partnership, then I am satisfied that the mutual
trust and confidence which the parties placed
in each other, and their
commitment to act in the joint interest of each other in the joint venture,
were such as to give rise to
a fiduciary relationship.
<P>

29  	The contrary was not seriously argued by the defendant, and I
will not spend any further time on this aspect of the case. 
I am satisfied
that a fiduciary relationship did exist, giving rise to duties in the terms of
the first three of those  identified
by the plaintiffs, as set out above.  To
the question of any breach of those duties, I will return.   In that regard,
the fourth
and fifth items identified seem to me to be incidents of potential
breach rather than duties themselves.
<P>

<P>

30  	The plaintiffs conceded that this head of claim was out of time,
and it was not pursued.
<P>

<b>THE MATTERS FACTUALLY IN DISPUTE</b>
<P>

31  	Evidence was given by the plaintiffs and by the defendant as to
the circumstances surrounding the creation of the joint venture,
and concerning
the disclosure by the defendant to the plaintiffs of the cost of construction
of the units.  This evidence was very
much in dispute, and upon it the
plaintiffs' claims critically turn.
<P>

<b>Pre agreement meetings</b>
<P>

32  	The second plaintiff said that after he had obtained some
quotations for the construction of the units, he asked the defendant,
for whom
he had done some kitchen installation work, whether he was interested in
quoting on the job.  The defendant's initial response
was negative, but some
weeks later he phoned asking for a copy of the plans, and said that he might
change his mind.  The defendant,
according to him, said that he would come back
to Wollongong one weekend and look around at the units that were being built in
the
area.
<P>

33  	A week or two later, the second plaintiff said, the defendant
phoned him, said that he had looked around at some units with
the agents, and
was interested in the project.  Arrangements were made for a weekend meeting.
On the Friday night they met in the
defendant's motel, where a decision was
made for a meeting over dinner the following night, (16 September 1989) at the
City Pacific
International Restaurant, with other family members.  According to
him there was no site inspection that night.
<P>

34  	It was the evidence of each of the plaintiffs that this meeting
proceeded as a dinner meeting.  On their version there were
present also the
defendant's wife, and the first plaintiffs' son.  They said that, at this
meeting, they showed the defendant their
plans for the units, along with the
Development and Building Approvals, and advised that they had received three
verbal quotes, namely
from Arnold Hanson for $1.45m, Bill Bundis of Carrington
Constructions for $1.5m, and Burnshore Constructions for $1.4m. (according
to
the first plaintiff) or $1.45m (according to the second plaintiff).  
<P>

35  	They said that the defendant advised them that he could build
the units cheaper, and indicated that he would make some inquiries
with local
agents as to the going price for comparable units.  In response to the
defendant's request, the plaintiff said that her
costs to that point were
$204,000 and that she had borrowed $180,000.  It was the second plaintiffs'
account that the defendant said,
at this meeting, that he would think about
entering into a partnership to build the units.  There was no commitment by him
at that
stage, they conceded.
<P>

36  	In two respects, this account was accepted to be incorrect in
that the Building Approval had yet to be issued, and the plaintiffs'
outgoings
were not at that point crystallised at $204,000.
<P>

37  	The following day, the plaintiffs said, they had a further
conversation with the defendant, at the factory of the first plaintiff,
in the
course of which he confirmed his interest in the project, and said that he
would work out the construction costs.  The first
plaintiff said to him that
the units in contemplation had to be luxury units, with quality inclusions - a
requirement the defendant
said that he could more than keep.
<P>

38  	The second plaintiff said that, about a week later, the
defendant phoned him, stated that he thought a partnership was a good
idea, and
asked him to book a restaurant and a motel for a further meeting.
<P>

39  	This meeting, (on 23 September 1989) was held over dinner at the
Elsinor Travel Lodge, and was attended by the three of them,
along with the
defendant's wife, his three children, and two others, John Sofianopoulos and
Rosie Tsesmetzis.  In the course of discussions
that night, they said that the
defendant advised them that the venture was good, that he estimated the
building costs to be roughly
$1.24m, that the cost of the required finance
including the existing loan, would be in the order of $380,000, and that he
expected
to be able to squeeze 5 to 10 per cent off the building costs because
there was not much work around.  Additionally, he said that
he had checked the
worth of the units and expected that they could be sold for between $180,000
and $300,000 with the penthouse bringing
about $420,000, thereby achieving
total sales of $2.4m.  These prices they said were noted on a piece of paper
shown to them.  The
plaintiffs added that the defendant said, during this
dinner, that the units could be sold off the plan.  Mr. Sofianopoulos suggested
making a model for this purpose.
<P>

40  	According to the first plaintiff, the defendant also said at
this meeting:
<P>

"I guarantee if you go with me that we will each make $150,000 and anything up
to $260,000;  we'll have to form a company so we
will become equal shareholders
and you will have to transfer the land into that company, whatever you spent to
now I'll put in half
of that so [we] have equal shares of a third each."
<P>

She said that she informed the defendant that she had put in $204,000 for
herself and for her brother, and as a consequence he said
that he would put in
$102,000.  She added that the defendant said that he had been building for many
years, that he could get references
from people who could recommend his work,
and that he had just completed six units in Mittagong.
<P>

41  	In an earlier affidavit, filed in the winding up proceedings,
the first plaintiff had attributed a slightly different conversation
to the
defendant this day along the lines that he said:
<P>

"I have done my work Sophie.  It is a very good project.  I think it should
cost just over one million dollars to build.  We should
get just over $200,000
out of the venture".
<P>

The first plaintiff sought to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the
two versions on the basis that, with five to ten percent
cut off, the cost
would be "just over $1m."
<P>

42  	The first plaintiff said that the cost of construction was the
most critical aspect of the venture, and determinative of whether
it would go
ahead.  The quotes that had been obtained by the  second plaintiff were too
high to make it a profitable proposition,
the land costs being assessed by the
plaintiffs at $380,000, the interest cost to finance construction being
assessed at $200,000,
and the total sales value assessed at $2.2m.  The
partnership she said would not have proceeded had the construction costs not
been
as agreed with the defendant.  The sum of $1.24m estimated by him
included, on her understanding, the wages of the defendant as well
as any
commission.
<P>

43  	The second plaintiff similarly said that he understood the lump
sum cost of construction to have been $1.2m.  He affirmed that
he would not
have entered into a partnership with the defendant, had the total costs of
building not been agreed.
<P>

44  	The defendant did not accept the plaintiffs' version of these
preliminary discussions, including the introductory conversation
deposed to by
the second plaintiff, as well as the events that the plaintiffs described as
having occurred at the City Pacific International
and the Elsinor Motor
Lodge.
<P>

45  	He acknowledged that at the time of the alleged meetings he was
the managing director of BCE, which traded as a builder, and
that he held the
degree of Bachelor of Civil Engineering, although he had never practised as
such.  He held a gold licence issued
by the Department of Fair Trading, and
apart from working on private homes, he had been involved in one home unit
project at Mittagong.
This was a current project in which he was a joint
venturer with a real estate agent, Don Ciccone.  He acknowledged that he had
been
looking around for another such project in the Gosford or Wollongong
areas, and that he had adopted for this purpose a rule of thumb
assessment of
the construction costs for town houses of $6,000 per square.
<P>

46  	According to him, he first heard of the project in September
1989, when the second plaintiff phoned him, informing him of it,
and asking
whether he was interested.  His reply was in the affirmative.  He said that he
would go down to Wollongong to see the
second plaintiff and his sister.  Some
time later he phoned the second plaintiff and suggested they meet to talk about
the project
over lunch.
<P>

47  	On 13 September, he made a reservation for his wife and himself
at the City Pacific International Hotel, for this purpose.
On Friday 15
September, they drove down to Wollongong and checked into the hotel.  That
evening he said that the second plaintiff
picked him up, drove him to the site,
and then onto the first plaintiffs' factory, arriving there at about 11pm.  On
the way he said,
the second defendant pointed out some units, and mentioned
that units at North Bay and Sorrento were selling for $300,000 each.
<P>

48  	At the factory, he said that the first plaintiff showed him some
preliminary drawings.  He expressed interest in building the
units, and asked
whether the plaintiffs wanted a lump sum contract, or hourly rate, or day
labour.  He said that his rates were about
$50.00 an hour plus 10%.
<P>

49  	When the first plaintiff asked him how much it was going to
cost, he said that he did not know and asked in turn how many squares
were
involved.  The first plaintiff replied that the units were about 10 square
each, and asked whether it would cost $1m.  He replied
that he did not know.
The second plaintiff, however, denied that there was any meeting at the factory
of the first plaintiff this
night, or any conversation along the lines to which
the defendant deposed.
<P>

50  	On Saturday 16 September 1989, the defendant said that he and
his wife met with the plaintiffs over lunch at the City Pacific
International.
According to him the first plaintiff asked "Now you have seen the plans for the
units, do you think it is a good proposal?",
to which he replied "It seems like
a good proposal.  Good luck with it."  
<P>

51  	This was a somewhat curious response in the light of his
professed interest, and his subsequent activity as recorded in his
diary.  For
example, his diary has entries for 18 September 1999: "Ring Wollongong re
computer printout, zoning plans";  and for
21 September 1989, "Ring Jimmy re
pick up plans from Council ... and copies of plans".  The defendant
acknowledged placing these
inquiries and, in particular, asking the second
plaintiff to pick up zoning plans from the Council, and inquiring whether the
first
plaintiff had copies of the plans which she had said she would get for
him.  Moreover on 19 September he made arrangements for accommodation
at the
Dapto Inn for Saturday 23 September.
<P>

52  	In the week commencing 18 September 1989, he said that the first
plaintiff informed him that she was having trouble financing
the project, and
asked whether he could do so.  He replied in the negative, but confirmed that
he would be interested in becoming
a partner.  He said that he could not give
an answer until he had "checked things".
<P>

53  	On Saturday 23 September 1989, he said that having travelled to
Wollongong the previous night, he rang a real estate agent,
Paul Dignam, and
inquired as to the sale price of two bedroom units.  He went to the factory of
the first plaintiff, where he picked
up some drawings, and then made further
inquiry of Mr. Dignam and of Ray White Real Estate, as to sale prices.  He
noted some prices
in his diary for second floor units in the sums of $115,000
and $103,000, which he obtained either from the agents, for from the
newspaper.

<P>

54  	He agreed that, on that evening of 23 September, he and his
wife, who was a director and shareholder of BCE and with whom he
regularly
discussed business affairs, met the plaintiffs for dinner at the Elsinor Motor
Lodge.  This he said, notwithstanding the
activities earlier that day, was a
purely social occasion, at which the project was not discussed in any detail.
To this stage, he
had not seen any detailed plans, and had not made up any
quote or estimated a building cost.  Because he was fully occupied on the
Mittagong units and was about to start a new project at Roseville, he said that
he was unable to give any more time or thought to
the project.
<P>

55  	He denied being informed that the plaintiffs had already
received three quotes, and said that the first he heard of them was
when he
read the first plaintiffs' affidavit.  It follows that he denied saying, at the
City Pacific International meeting, that
he could do the job cheaper.  He also
denied that the first plaintiff said that her expenses to that point were
$204,000.
<P>

56  	The defendant similarly denied that the parties had any
conversation, at the first plaintiffs' sewing factory, on the day after
the
City Pacific International meeting, or subsequently at the Elsinor Travel Lodge
along the lines deposed to by the plaintiffs.
 He denied that, at various
subsequent times, he confirmed or repeated, as the first plaintiff suggested,
that the construction costs
would be in the order of $1.24m, which he expected
to cut by 5 to 10 per cent, or by some equivalent monetary amount.
<P>

57  	The defendant also denied having said to the plaintiffs at the
Elsinor Travel Lodge, or at any time, that they would "each
make $150,000 and
anything up to $260,000" from the units.  However, it may be noted that the
diary of the ANZ bank manager of 28
August 1991 records him saying that the
profit he expected  was "around $200K".   This the defendant suggested was an
error of interpretation
by the bank.
<P>

<b>Further investigation of the project</b>
<P>

58  	The defendant said that the first plaintiff asked him to meet
the financier (Mercantile Credits), the architect (Lance Peckman)
and the
engineer (Reno from Sherston &amp; Associates), on Wednesday 4 October 1989, in
Wollongong.  His diary noted such a meeting
but he could not recall whether it
took place. 
<P>

59  	On 9 October his diary noted "Ring Sophie re plans ready".  On
10 October, he said he called the first plaintiff again inquiring
about the
plans.  On 12 October his diary noted "plans for Wollongong should be here
today".  On 18 October, he said that he phoned
the first plaintiff to arrange a
meeting for Monday 23 October or Tuesday 24 October, to finalise an agreement
in principle for the
building of the units.  Before this call he said that he
had informed her that he was still happy to build the units for an hourly
rate
of $50 plus 7.5% of the cost of construction.
<P>

60  	On 23 October, he said (in his affidavit) that he went to the
site where  he inspected the test bores that the engineer was
making, before
going on to Mercantile Credits to drop off a balance sheet for BCE, and then to
Lance Peckman to pick up copies of
the latest plans.  After doing these things,
he said that  he met the plaintiffs at the factory.  His diary note records,
"go to
Sophie preparation contracts, incl. Sep. agreement wages etc.", but
beyond this he had no recollection of what was discussed.
<P>

61  	In his evidence at the trial he was somewhat uncertain as to
whether the various events recorded in his diary occurred, in
fact, on the days
noted, or in some cases at all, or whether they were merely notes of matters
that were planned.
<P>

62  	On 26 October, he said (again, in his affidavit) that he
returned to the Corrimal site and inspected the test bores.  He then
went to
the office of Mercantile Credits, where he was asked to provide another  set of
plans. He collected them from Lance Peckman
and returned them to Mercantile
Credits.   He also met with the first plaintiff, but did not provide any
details of the meeting.
 Somewhat curiously, he said that it was his
recollection that the events recorded in his diary for 23 October, may have
occurred
on 26 October, even though he had earlier asserted the contrary.
Perhaps not too much turns upon this beyond noting that he did meet
with
Mercantile Credits, the engineers, the architect and the plaintiffs this
week.
<P>

63  	On 29 October, he said that he returned to Wollongong, and as
noted in his diary obtained a copy of the plans from the plaintiff,
took some
levels at the site, assessed the  demolition of the cottages and the clearing
of the site, wrote out on a piece of paper
a deal with the plaintiffs, and
possibly on this day took the financial statements to Mercantile Credits which
he had earlier stated
were taken to it on 23 October.  
<P>

64  	On 29 October, he said that he obtained the plans from the first
plaintiff.  On 1 November he said that he discussed the visitors
parking layout
with the Council, and spoke to the plaintiffs' solicitor about the
consolidation of the site and its mortgage to Mercantile
Credits.
<P>

65  	During this month he said that the first plaintiff phoned him
and said that as soon as he was ready they would like him to
get going on the
project.
<P>

66  	Between 2 and 13 November 1989, he said that he made phone calls
and visits, concerning the project, to or with the plaintiffs'
solicitors, the
engineer, the Council, Mercantile Credits, and an alternative financier.  He
also placed an advertisement in the
local newspaper for demolition tenders.
<P>

<b>Agreement of 14 November 1989</b>
<P>

67  	On 13 November 1989, the defendant said that he prepared the
letter of agreement which was signed on the following day at the
factory of the
second plaintiff, and witnessed by an employee of the latter.   It was his
evidence that they each approved of the
agreement, under which BCE was to
construct the units at the rate of $50 per hour plus 7.5% of the costs of
construction.  There
were several discussions concerning these rates, he said,
before the agreement was prepared and signed.  Once the agreement was signed
he
said that the he felt confident that he had won the job and could go ahead in
anticipation of securing the finance.
<P>

68  	Thereafter he said that he had various further discussions with
Mercantile Credits, the engineer, the architect, the Council,
the plaintiffs,
their Solicitors, their accountants, the valuer and others.
<P>

69  	The plaintiffs acknowledged that the document signed on 14
November recorded the basis upon which BCE was to build the units,
but said
that they took it for granted that the defendant's wages were included in the
$1.24m which they understood to be the total
costs of construction.  No
explanation was provided, if that was the case, as to why the letter of
agreement did not simply note
a cost of $1.24m.
<P>

<b>Burgess &amp; Jaye valuation of 28 November 1989</b>
<P>

70  	The next significant event prior to execution of the loan
documents, was the preparation by Burgess &amp; Jaye of the valuation
of the
construction costs and sales projections dated 28 November 1989.  The defendant
said that this had been requested by Mr. McLaughlin
of Mercantile Credits at a
meeting attended by him and by the first plaintiff on 13 November 1989.
According to him, the first plaintiff
asked him to organise the valuation with
Mr. Burgess.  This led to him contacting Mr. Burgess on 15 November and meeting
with  him
on 23 November, a date against which his diary records "12.00
Malcolm Burgess  Tues valuation to G. Smart".  On 28 November, his
diary notes
"go to Malcolm Burgess re valuation".  On 30 November there is an entry "10.00.
Ed Smart at Wollongong, valuation by
Malcolm".
<P>

71  	The first plaintiff admitted meeting Mr. McLaughlin, with the
defendant, at Mercantile Credits.  Although initially she said,
in cross
examination, that she recalled him saying something to the effect that they
would need to get a valuation, later she said
that she could not recall the
details of the discussion.
<P>

72  	It was the defendant's evidence that he discussed the valuation
with the plaintiffs.  He said that when he asked them what
they thought of the
sales figures, the first plaintiff replied "I think they're a bit low".  In
particular, he said that the plaintiffs
considered Mr. Burgess' valuation of
the penthouse at $325,000 as being too low and suggested that they put $600,000
on it.  It was
later offered to Mrs. Innes at this sum, but reduced after
negotiation to $470,000.
<P>

73  	The diary contains no entry that would expressly support the
defendant's evidence in this regard.  It does, however, contain
entries for 23
November: "discussion with Sofie re shelf company"; for 24 November: "ring
Sofie re accountant shelf company";  for
28 November: "ring Sophie and Jim ...
ring Pat Quinn";  for 29 November: "go to Sophie, Jimmy contract prepared,
shelf company, financial
statements";  and for 1 December: "go to Wollongong
9.00am. Sophie financial statements, water diagram 10.00am. Ed. Smart -
valuation
by Malcolm".
<P>

74  	The plaintiffs denied seeing the valuation or being aware, at
any time before May 1998, that the construction costs had been
valued by Mr.
Burgess at $1.45m.  The first plaintiff said that had she seen the valuation
she would not have gone ahead with the
project.
<P>

75  	Mr. Burgess said that the valuation was requested by the
defendant, with whom he discussed some modifications to the plans.
 He did not
have any dealings with the plaintiffs in relation to this valuation.
<P>

76  	Although no invoice from Mr. Burgess for this valuation was
placed into evidence, it would seem that it was paid for by Emery
Park, being
part of a sum of $1,050 paid on 11 May 1990.  The cheque butt suggests that
this sum represented payments for three valuations
in sums of $675, $250 and
$125; the larger of which the defendant suggested related to the November
valuation.  Three valuations
had in fact been prepared by Burgess &amp; Jaye to
that point, namely the two relating to the subject lands which had been
prepared
in support of the sale to Emery Park, and the November valuation. 
<P>

77  	Although the defendant seemed in his evidence to have had little
recollection of the terms of this valuation, he was prepared
to accept, as one
would think he must have done, that if the total sales value was $2m; and that,
to a construction cost of $1.4m,
there had to be added a land cost of $325,000,
interest of $200,000 and the costs of the sale of the units, the venture would
not
have been profitable.  He further acknowledged that had the venture not
proceeded, then he (or BCE) would not have received the $2,000
per week or the
commission of 7.5% on the building costs.
<P>

<b>Work undertaken between January and May 1990.</b>
<P>

78  	By January 1990, the defendant said that he had finished the
Mittagong and Roseville jobs, and advised the first plaintiff
that, once
finance was approved, he would get on with the job.   To that point he said
that the only costs discussions, that had
been undertaken with the plaintiffs,
were general discussions about the rates of the tradesmen he was considering
using, or rough
 estimates of the costs of specific parts of the building, such
as the kitchens.  He added that before this he neither had the opportunity,
or
the plans, to work out the full construction costs.
<P>

79  	He said that thereafter he spoke on several occasions to Mr.
Smart of Mercantile Credits, and in the meantime got on with preparations
for
the project.  During the month of January, he said that the first plaintiff
said to him, "If the job takes off we will pay you
your wages as agreed until
the job starts."  He did not take on any other work between January and June
1990, but busied himself
with obtaining quotations, working up the drawings,
speaking to the Council, the architect and the engineer, and negotiating a sale
of the penthouse to Daphne Innes, who he said was introduced to him by the
first plaintiff.   He said that the first plaintiff came
to the site office
almost daily and discussed these matters with him.  He acknowledged that he had
not kept time sheets, or diary
entries for those activities.
<P>

80  	It was only after he received a copy of the Building Approval in
February 1990, and the more detailed drawings which had accompanied
it, that he
could calculate a rough estimate of the construction costs.  At about this
time, he said that he informed the first plaintiff,
"I think the costs are
going to be about $1.4m to $1.45m, plus or minus 10%".  Upon his case this was
the first time that he had
given any indicative costing for the units. The
plaintiffs each denied that there was any such conversation, either then or at
any
other time.  It was their case that the defendant had given the price of
$1.24m back in September 1989, and that this was the agreed
construction
cost.
<P>

81  	Between January and June 1990, he said that the three of them
had numerous discussions about the prices that might be obtained
for the units,
as well as discussions with several real estate agents, although he could not
recall whether any overall valuation
was given.  These discussions also
extended, he said, to the timing of the sales so as to pay off the loan. It was
arising out of
these discussions, he suggested, that the agreement  of 4 July
1990 was prepared by Mr. Quinn and  signed by the parties.
<P>

82  	As events turned out, notwithstanding their attempts to sell
units off the plan, only the penthouse and unit 3 were sold during
the
construction phase, the penthouse in May 1990, and unit 3 in May 1991.
According to the defendant the latter sale was agreed
to even though the offer
was much lower than the price they wanted, because of their desire to get the
sales under way. 
<P>

83  	In the middle of March 1990, the defendant said that he
contemplated moving off the site to take on a development in the Central
Coast,
as the loan approval had yet to materialise.  The first plaintiff, he said,
asked him not to go away.  Thereafter he had various
discussions with
Mercantile Credits concerning the loan finance.
<P>

84  	The first plaintiff agreed that between October 1989 and May
1990, there were several discussions about the project, and that
from about
January 1990 the defendant moved into one of the houses on the site.  She said
that, in the course of these conversations
the defendant repeated that the
construction costs would be $1.24m and that they should be able to sell the
units for $2m.
<P>

<b>Building Agreement of 23 May 1990</b>
<P>

85  	On 20 April 1990, the defendant said that he informed the
plaintiffs that Mercantile Credits required a mortgage over his Belmore
home.
Additionally, he said that he advised them of its requirement for a lump sum
building contract.  There was no diary entry to
support any such discussion on
or about this date.
<P>

86  	On 17 May 1990, the defendant said that he took a form of
building contract, in the Housing Industries Association form, to
Mercantile
Credits.  This contract he said did not represent the true agreement with him,
that being the agreement recorded in the
letter of agreement of 14 November
1989.  It was prepared, he said, only because Mercantile Credits insisted on
having a lump sum
contract.  Before it was signed by the parties in the office
of Mercantile Credits, (on 23 May 1990) he said that it was discussed
with the
plaintiffs.  According to him he said that he thought they should put in the
estimate of $1.45m which he had discussed with
them earlier.  The first
plaintiff asked whether that meant they were "locked into that price?" to which
he said "No.  This is only
for the finance purposes, our agreement is the one
we signed in November and, as we've discussed before, materials and labour will
be charged at cost."  This, he said, she accepted.
<P>

87  	The plaintiffs denied, in their affidavits, any such
conversation.  During her cross examination the first plaintiff said that
she
did not remember actually signing the building agreement of 23 May 1990, but
asserted that the figure of $1.63m which was ultimately
borrowed was based upon
a construction cost of $1.24m plus $200,000 interest, and $183,000 for the
land, and not upon a construction
cost of $1.45m plus interest.  It was for
that reason that there was no protest, she said, concerning the execution of
this agreement.
 The second plaintiff similarly said that, although he had no
specific recollection of signing the document, he understood, upon
the basis of
the previous discussions, that the $1.45m mentioned included the 1.24m
construction costs and $200,000 for interest,
and not a figure of $1.45
mentioned by the defendant in February 1990.
<P>

<b>Plaintiffs' borrowings from Dorothy Innes</b>
<P>

88  	In April 1990, the defendant arranged for the plaintiffs to meet
at an accountants office to form a company in which they would
be equal
shareholders.  Soon after they said they were informed by the defendant that
each would need to put a further $25,000 into
the  project in order to get the
loan.  A little while later, they met at the office which the defendant had
established.  They were
informed that Mercantile Credits required that they
have available, by way of security for the interest on the loan, a sum of
$210,000.
 The first plaintiff said that the defendant suggested that her share
of  this sum be borrowed from Daphne Innes, who was the proposed
purchaser of
the penthouse.  He denied that this was the case, suggesting that it was her
own initiative to approach Ms. Innes for
a loan.
<P>

89  	However the seed was sown, it is the fact that the first
plaintiff borrowed $140,000 from Mrs. Innes, at an interest rate of
20%  per
annum.  It was after this that the plaintiffs paid into Emery Park's bank
account the sum of $105,000, recorded as a deposit
on 24 May 1990, of which
$60,000 represented an advance from Ms. Innes, $20,000 was provided by the
first plaintiff and $25,000 came
from the second plaintiff.
<P>

<b>1st June 1990 agreement</b>
<P>

90  	The defendant said that the 1st June 1990 agreement was signed
following discussions with the plaintiffs as to the manner in
which their
contributions could be equalised.  Initially he said it was decided that the
plaintiffs would transfer the land as their
contribution and that he would put
in $102,230 in cash.  However, Mr. Smart, he said, indicated that the parties
needed to show that
they had $280,000 available as working capital, in order to
get a loan.  He then made the calculations recorded in the June documents,
including the credits in his favour for $70,000 and $53,976 mentioned above,
and a credit in favour of the first plaintiff for $35,740
for interest paid
out.
<P>

91  	It was his account that when these documents were handed to the
plaintiffs, at a meeting arranged about this time and read
over, they said
"that's OK".   He added that before agreeing to offer his house as security for
the loan, he had informed the plaintiffs
of his wife's opposition and of his
own concerns.  It was his suggestion, he said, that they view the arrangement
as one under which
Emery Park would nominally purchase the property and use it
as security, and under which he and his wife would be nominally credited
with
the proceeds of sale upon which interest could be calculated at a commercial
rate, so as to determine a fee for its use as security.
 He suggested that the
use of his premises as a security was requested by the first plaintiff since
neither she nor the second plaintiff
had any property to offer.  He also said
that it was at her request that the valuation of 6 April 1990 of his home  was
obtained,
inferentially so as to support the calculation.
<P>

92  	The plaintiffs disputed the defendant's version of this meeting.
The first plaintiff said that, when the defendant explained
the basis on which
he had worked out the value of his contributions in kind at $70,000 and at
$53,976, she protested that this was
not fair, offered her father's house as
security (which he said Mercantile Credits would not accept because her father
was not involved
in the project), and asserted that he had not done any work to
that point.  She was sufficiently concerned, she said, to walk out
of the
meeting, but at a meeting arranged a few days later she accepted the
calculations and signed the agreement of 1 June.  She
did this, she explained,
because she was informed that Mercantile Credits had approved the loan, and
because the defendant had said
that he would not commence construction unless
she signed.  She also said that she realised that the land had been transferred
to
Emery Park, and that the project would be further delayed if she tried to
reverse the transfer.
<P>

93  	The second plaintiff similarly disputed the defendant's account
of the meeting, and confirmed that following a heated argument,
his sister had
walked out.  The documents he also agreed were signed about a week after the
date which they bore.   The defendant
denied that the first plaintiff walked
out of this or any meeting, and also denied that the plaintiff had offered her
father's house
as security.
<P>

<b>Contributions</b>
<P>

94  	On 17 July 1990, the first plaintiff said that she paid a
further $80,000 to the defendant, made up by cheques for $40,000
and cash in an
equivalent amount, (made up of $50 notes).  It is accepted by the defendant
that $40,000 was paid into the bank account
of Emery Park, on behalf of the
plaintiffs, at this time.  The payment of the remaining $40,000 in cash was,
however, disputed  by
the defendant, who denied the receipt of any such sum.
The first plaintiff said that this payment in cash was sourced to various
withdrawals from her bank account and had been kept in a box in her home, since
having cash gave her a feeling of security.
<P>

95  	The withdrawals were identified as follows:
<P>

<b>Date			Cheque No		Amount</b>
<P>

5/2/90		109932			$12,500
<P>

	23/2/90		109944			5,000
<P>

	24/4/90		316952			5,000
<P>

	11/5/90		316964			5,500
<P>

	18/5/90		316966			4,500
<P>

	13/7/90		371586			<u>9,320</u>
<P>

								$41,820
<P>

96  	Although cheque butts were tendered recording payments in these
sums, only the sum of $5000 drawn on 23 February 1990,  can
now be matched with
a withdrawal recorded in the bank pass sheets. The remaining relevant
statements (pages 66, 67, 69 and 70) were
not produced.  It was said could not
be located or recovered from the bank.  It is of relevance, however, to note
that the account
operated for most of the period either barely in credit or
overdrawn, that the withdrawal of $5,500 placed it into overdraft, and
that at
about the time of the alleged withdrawal of $12,500, a sum in that amount was
in fact credited to the account.
<P>

97  	There was no documentary record to support the receipt by the
defendant of a cash payment of $40,000 at this time.  The alleged
cash cheque
withdrawal of $12,500, was of considerable significance since the statements
for February and March were available and
did not record its presentation
between at least 5 February 1990 and 20 March 1990, even though the first
plaintiff said that it
had been cashed immediately. The account had a debit
balance of $68.74 at 20 March and the next available statement opened with a
debit balance of $15,628.72, which could be consistent with the cheque having
been presented between  those dates.  The position
in relation to this alleged
payment was not, however, assisted by the inability of the first plaintiff to
show how the $40,000 that
was in fact deposited to the bank account of Emery
Park on 17 July 1990 was sourced, or to explain how the full $140,000 borrowed
from Mrs. Innes was applied.  
<P>

98  	Although the plaintiffs initially pursued the allegation that
the defendant received, and did not account for, this cash payment
of $40,000,
ultimately in their submissions in reply the claim was abandoned because of the
difficulty in its proof.
<P>

99  	It was not in issue that an account was effectively struck
between the parties as at 1 June 1990 for their respective contributions,
or
that it was followed by subsequently agreed payments, so as to reflect the
following position:
<P>

<P>

<b>The Construction and Sale Period</b>
<P>

101  	The first plaintiff said that, at various stages during the
demolition and construction phase, i.e. between July 1990 and
July 1991, the
defendant assured her that he was getting cheaper prices, observing at one
point that he should be able to get$100,000
off his original quote of $1.24m.
The second plaintiff said that he attended the site on a regular basis during
the early stages
of construction, upon which occasions he was assured that
"things were going according to plan".  .   Each Friday he attended at
the
defendant's office, where he checked the invoices which had been entered up in
pencil in an exercise book, (the yellow book)
and initialled that book.  By
about March 1991, he said that the plaintiffs no longer inspected the invoices
or signed the book.
<P>

102  	The first plaintiff said that, at various times, she requested
but was denied, access to the accounting records and supporting
vouchers for
the building work.  She did see that a cash book was being kept, but said that
the entries were in pencil.  The only
time, according to her, when she saw
invoices was when they were presented to her with a cheque for her signature,
the bank authority
requiring two signatories for cheques drawn in amounts above
$10,000.
<P>

103  	The defendant denied withholding from the plaintiffs the
records, and said that, from time to time, they saw the invoices
and initialled
the cash book kept for the project.
<P>

<b>The venture unravels</b>
<P>

104  	In May 1991, the second plaintiff said that he phoned the
defendant and asked how much would be left over on completion of
the job.  The
defendant said that they should have about $100,000 each.   A week or two
later, he was informed by the defendant that
it was now only $70,000 each, as
there were some bills for which he had not provided.   The defendant thereafter
proved evasive when
the topic was raised, causing the second plaintiff to
insist on seeing the books.  The defendant at this stage produced a bundle
of
unpaid invoices which totalled about $51,000, and a bank statement which he
recalled having a balance of $50,000.  When the second
plaintiff asked where
was the $70,000 each was supposed to receive, the defendant said "I've got to
go".  The defendant denied that
there were any conversations along these lines.
According to him, the only inquiry made by the second plaintiff was in May
1991,
when he was asked by him whether he could take $5,000 out of the company,
to which he replied in the negative.
<P>

105  	The first plaintiff said that in June 1991, while on holiday in
Greece, she telephoned the defendant, after receiving news
from the second
plaintiff of his conversation.  She said that she had been informed by her
brother that there was no money left.
 The defendant replied to the effect that
her brother did not know what he was talking about, but said that he would
phone her back
on Monday, as it was 3am.when the call came through.   This did
not occur.  When she phoned him again, she said that he hung up on
her.  The
defendant denied that events unfolded in this way.  Rather, he said that he had
spoken to her brother and asked him to
bring her up to date.
<P>

106  	Upon her return to Australia the first plaintiff made an
inspection of the units and then rang the defendant to complain of
their state,
and to ask him to bring down the books so that they could go through them
together.  According to her, he refused to
produce them to her or to her
accountant.  Her threat of legal action was met with the response, according to
her "You haven't got
enough money for one solicitor, I have enough for fifteen
solicitors".  The defendant admitted that the first plaintiff rang him,
on her
return from Greece, and asked for the books.  He said that he offered to go
through them with her rather than hand them over.
<P>

107  	When she went to the ANZ Bank to request copies of the bank
statements for Emery Park, being the account into which monies
drawn down from
the loan were deposited, and from which progress payments were made, she
discovered that the account was held with
the Earlwood branch where the
defendant banked, contrary to her belief that it had been opened at Wollongong.
She also found that,
without her knowledge, the account was overdrawn by about
$35,000.
<P>

108  	It was in consequence of these developments that the meeting of
directors was requisitioned by her brother, at which the defendant
was
requested, but refused to produce the books.  This he said occurred because he
did not trust the plaintiffs.  The resolutions
that were "passed" this day, he
said, were dealt with without any opportunity for debate, and led ultimately to
Mr. Walter, the plaintiffs'
solicitor, telling him, "This meeting's over.
You're out."  These events were followed, it was common ground, by the
appointment
of a receiver and manager, and ultimately of a liquidator, it
having become apparent that the parties were in serious dispute over
the
project.
<P>

<b>The sale of Unit 3</b>
<P>

109  	The position in relation to Unit 3 is somewhat curious.
Although the contract provided for a sale price of $220,000 reduced
to $125,000
for early completion, the defendant said that the reduction was to $175,000 of
which $50,000 was paid in cash.  The memorandum
of transfer recorded a sale
price of $220,000 yet the letter from the agent advising of the sale mentioned
a sale price of $175,000.
 The notice of transfer prepared by the solicitor for
Emery Park recorded a sale price of $125,000.  
<P>

110  	If in fact the sale price was $220,000, of which $50,000 was
received in cash, then $45,000 was not accounted for.  If on
the other hand the
sale price was $175,000 of which $50,000 was received in cash, then there was
no failure to account.
<P>

111  	It was the evidence of the first plaintiff that the defendant
said that he had negotiated the price down to $220,000 because
$100,000 was to
be paid in cash, a sum which he later said was to be paid "under the table" to
him, at a time when he and the buyer
did not want the plaintiffs present.
Although she initially denied that there had been any conversation in relation
to the requirement
for a Council bond, ultimately she acknowledged that there
had been such a discussion. 
<P>

112  	The second plaintiff gave a somewhat different account, in so
far as he said that the defendant had informed him that he had
sold Unit 3 for
$220,000 for which a discount of $50,000 was given, and $50,000 was being
received in cash.  This sum, he acknowledged,
the defendant said would be given
to the Council as security for the strata title.
<P>

113  	The defendant denied that there was any conversation along the
lines of those deposed to by the first plaintiff.  On the contrary,
he said
that he explained to her why the $50,000 was required and how it was used to
obtain a bank guarantee to which she said "fine".
 It was his evidence that the
price for the unit, wrongly referred to in his first affidavit as Unit 1 (one
of the 1992 sales) was
$175,000, of which $50,000, he said, was provided in
cash on settlement and then used to obtain the bank guarantee.  This
explanation
must have been incorrect in that the bank deposit was made, and the
guarantee was obtained, in May 1991, yet the sale was not settled
until July.
It was corrected in his May 1999 statement, in which he said that it was he who
collected the $50,000 on exchange.  In
this document he asserted that the
arrangement was discussed with the plaintiffs, so that Units 3 and 10 could be
settled immediately
upon completion of the works, thereby reducing the interest
payable to Mercantile Credits.  It was his evidence that it was the first
plaintiff who had in fact made the suggestion that they ask for $50,000 to be
paid on exchange, and that it be used to pay for the
bond required by the
Council.  This the first plaintiff denied.
<P>

114  	I observe that Unit 3 was a three bedroom ground floor unit.
Had it been sold for $220,000 then it would have achieved a price
equivalent to
that for Unit 9, a three bedroom unit on the third floor, that was sold in
August 1991 for $222,000.  It would have
been the third most expensive unit in
the building.  The first plaintiff however, said that she regarded the price as
acceptable
for a ground floor unit.
<P>

115  	The documents do support the defendant's account that the sum
of $50,000 was used for a deposit in BCE's name, against which
a bank guarantee
was obtained in favour of the Council, so as to secure release of the Strata
Plan.   They similarly support the
subsequent application of those funds, and
the interest earned, for the benefit of the Emery Park project.
<P>

116  	Some concerns initially arose in relation to arrangements
apparently being made for a purchase of land being effected partially
for cash,
and as to those moneys having been diverted from the vendor (Emery Park) to the
builder (BCE).  It does, however, appear
from the transfer that the
consideration was not understated so as to avoid stamp duty, that the monies
were applied in the way outlined
for the benefit of Emery Park, and that the
transaction was so structured because the Bank required to deal with a customer
it knew
(BCE) in issuing its guarantee.  While the documentation is
inconsistent, and the transaction suspicious, in the absence of evidence
from
the purchaser as to the amount paid, I am not prepared to find that the
defendant misappropriated, or failed to account for
any portion of the proceeds
of sale of the unit.
<P>

<b>The Hilaire Cost Estimate</b>
<P>

117  	A curious feature, which has more relevance to credit than
anything else, relates to a request made by the plaintiffs of the
quantity
surveyor, Tevor Hilaire in March 1992, to provide an estimate of the
construction costs.  The first plaintiff explained
that this request was
initiated by their solicitors, and led to her meeting Mr. Hilaire, with her
brother, on the site.    
<P>

118  	It was Mr. Hilaire's account, however, that they met at the
Towradgi chicken shop and not on the site.  Moreover, he said
that the second
plaintiff was introduced to him on 27 February 1992, as John Christo, rather
than as Jim Tsesmetzis, the implication
being, for reasons that are not readily
apparent, that the second plaintiff was impersonating the defendant in their
discussions.
 His recollection of this was based upon his practice of writing
down the names of people immediately he met them.  
<P>

119  	Mr. Hilaire  said that, during their first meeting, he was
informed that they had a block of ten units that they were building,
that they
thought they had paid too much, and they wanted him to have a look at the plans
and give them an idea of what the cost
should have been.  He performed some
rough calculations and then said, based upon the drawings provided and industry
rates, that
the cost for construction during 1990/1991 was somewhere between
$1.5m and $1,778,250.  The first plaintiff, he said, replied "we
received a
quote of $1.45m".  His note does not bear this out entirely,  the actual entry
recording "quotes had been approx $1,450,000",
this being more consistent with
the three verbal quotes which the second plaintiff had received than with a
single quote in this
sum from the defendant.  It was Mr. Hilaire's account that
they then went to the site that night but were not allowed access.
<P>

120  	On 13 March Mr. Hilaire said that he visited the site again,
where he inspected three units.  He then prepared a detailed
estimate, after
examining the engineers plans, in the sum of $1,635,797, which he said was
delivered to the first plaintiff at the
Towradgi chicken shop on about 19 March
1992.  In a letter to her on 18 March, he recorded the adjustments for the
changes that had
been made during the works, which reduced the total costs by
$53,237.  This report he said complied with the request made by the
plaintiffs
for an estimate of the cost of the units as constructed.
<P>

121  	On 24 March 199, he said that he met the first plaintiff and
the man he thought to be Jim Christo at the office of Hackletons,
where he was
introduced to the solicitor Bruce Walter.  He saw that the solicitor had the
detailed cost estimate.  Mr. Walter said
to him, "This report is no good to us.
We need you to give a revised report showing the reasonable construction costs
to be less
than $1,000,000 so that we can commence legal action against the
builder."
<P>

122  	He refused to comply.  Mr. Walter then said "Don't worry.  It
will be six or eight months before anything happens.  You can
adjust your
report then."
<P>

123  	When he said that he was not interested, he was asked to leave
the room.  Later he was told by Jim that he should leave, and
that they would
call him when they had sorted out some interim problems as the builder was
their cousin.   
<P>

124  	He sent a letter, on the following day ,confirming his opinion
that as a reasonable construction cost would be in excess of
$1m, his company
was not prepared to issue a report indicating a cost less than that sum.  The
terms in which this letter were written
tends to support his evidence that he
had been asked to provide a report estimating the construction costs in a sum
less than $1m.
<P>

125  	The plaintiffs denied this version of events, and suggested
that Mr, Hilaire may have mistakenly assumed that he was dealing
with John
Christo and Mrs. Papadopoulos because those were the names shown on the plans
which were provided to them.  There is some
force in this suggestion, since Mr.
Hilaire acknowledged that he was not good with names, and the spelling
Papadop<u>o</u>los in his hand, in the note of 27 February 1992, does appear in
some of the plans.  Additionally, it is the fact that the name he
wrote on the
note made on the first meeting was "Jim Christo", not John Christo, and that in
the note of his next meeting he did
not record the surname of the solicitor,
the entry being "Bruce?  Solicitor"
<P>

126  	The plaintiffs said that their concern with his valuation was
that it did not value the works as they were actually constructed.
 They denied
receiving his detailed report, although the first plaintiff accepted that she
must have received one or other of the
two letters that he sent to them on 18
March 1992.
<P>

127  	There were some other differences between the accounts. For
example, the first plaintiff asserted, although Mr. Hilaire denied,
that they
obtained access to the building on 27 February and then inspected one or two
unfinished units.  Mr. Hilaire said that they
tried to gain access after the
meeting at the chicken shop, but were told by an occupant to go away.
Additionally, he disputed the
first plaintiffs' account that his claim for
payment of his fees, was "settled".  He acknowledged however, that her
application for
time to pay the judgment debt by instalments led to an
agreement before that application reached the Court.  In that sense the claim
was "settled".
<P>

128  	Somewhat unsurprisingly, each of the plaintiffs said that they
did not remember the meeting at which Mr. Walters was present.
 Although not
initially willing to acknowledge that she had received the detailed costs
estimate referred to in the covering letter
of 18 March, ultimately the first
plaintiff agreed that it looked as though this document was returned by Mr.
Walters to Mr. Hilaire
upon her instructions, on 25 March 1992.  It would
follow that despite her denials, she must have received this document.
Moreover,
it is likely that it was against its receipt by her, that she drew
the cheque for Mr. Hilaire's fees, that was later stopped.
<P>

<b>Credit</b>
<P>

129  	In relation to many of the matters in issue, evidence that
might otherwise have been expected to be available was not called.
 For
example:
<P>

(a)	The defendant's wife was not called, nor were the relatives of the
plaintiffs who were at the September 1989 meetings at the
City Pacific
International and Elsinor Motor Inn meetings.
<P>

(b)	The Bank pass sheets for the alleged cash withdrawals by the first
plaintiff were not provided, and no explanation for their
loss was provided.
<P>

( c)	The purchaser, agent and/or solicitors acting on the sale of Unit 3 were
not called, even though each could have established
the correct price paid for
that unit.
<P>

(d)	None of the Mercantile Credits staff were called , nor were any of its
internal documents concerning, for example, the building
agreement and
valuation, produced.
<P>

(e)	Mr. Walters was not called in relation to the Hilaire valuation.
<P>

(f)	The brother in law of the first plaintiff was not called, although she said
that he was present when she handed over the $40,000
in cash.
<P>

130  	A <u>Jones v Dunkel</u> inference is, in my view, properly to
be drawn to the effect that this evidence, if called, would not have assisted
those who might
have been expected to proffer it.  That, however, produces a
somewhat neutral effect in relation to the September 1989 meetings.
<P>

131  	The plaintiffs' claims ultimately come down to a determination
of whether they are to be believed in preference to the defendant,
since it is
they who bear the onus of proof.  The case is one in which none of these three
witnesses made a particularly favourable
impression upon me.  Each, I am
satisfied, was determined to place the best face upon the various events and to
reconstruct where
memory was lacking.
<P>

132  	The plaintiffs in particular were obviously very resentful that
the venture had soured, and they were determined to pass the
blame to the
defendant, even though on the basis of the independent expert valuations, and
taking into account all development, holding
and sales costs, the true fact is
that the venture was, at best, always very marginal.  It was such that
experience and expertise,
well beyond that possessed by the parties, was
required if a development on this site was to be profitable to any significant
extent,
and particularly to the extent which the plaintiffs said they had in
mind.  The defendant, however, was somewhat defensive, and it
appeared to me,
prepared to reconstruct where a real memory was lacking.
<P>

133  	In relation to the plaintiffs, the following matters, it seems
to me, rebounded to occasion serious doubt as to their credibility:
<P>

(a)	the acknowledged error in the account, to which each initially deposed,
that at the first meeting in September 1989, they informed
the defendant that
the building application had been issued, and that their costs to date were
$204,000;
<P>

(b)	the first plaintiff's attempt to cling to that version when it was
challenged in cross examination, which extended to an assertion
that entries in
the cash book were hers, when, self evidently, that could not have been
true;
<P>

(c)	the inherent improbability that by the time of the second meeting, the
defendant would have made the calculations suggested
without the benefit of
building plans, or that he would have quoted a construction cost in the order
of $1.24m, from which "5 to
10 per cent could be squeezed off", in the face of
external quotations each of in excess of $1.4m;
<P>

(d)	the difference between the version given by the first plaintiff in these
proceedings as to a cost being quoted in the region
of $1.24m, and as to a
return to each of them being promised in the order of between $150,000 and
$260,000, compared with her affidavit
in the winding up proceedings, where she
said that the cost estimate given was "just over $1m", without any suggestion
of a five
to 10 per cent reduction, and that the defendant said <i>they</i>
should get "just over $200,000 out of the venture";
<P>

(e)	the inconsistencies between the alleged $1.24m quotation (and its alleged
repetition), the cost plus agreement of 14 November
1989 that was entered into,
and the lump sum building agreement provided to Mercantile Credits, which
recorded a construction cost
more in accordance with the external quotes, the
valuer's calculations, the quantity surveyor's calculations and the actual
construction
costs;
<P>

(f)	the somewhat hedged evidence given by the plaintiffs as to whether they saw
the lump sum building contract, even though it bears
their signatures;
<P>

(g)	the similarly hedged evidence of the first plaintiff as to whether she was
aware of the 28 November 1989 valuation, or whether
she had been present in
meetings with Mr. Smart of Mercantile Credits, at which the need for it was
discussed;
<P>

(h)	the inherent unlikelihood of the plaintiffs having gone ahead with the
venture if the first plaintiff had been as troubled over
the fairness of the
arrangements proposed by the defendant concerning the calculation of their
contributions to the point where,
on her account, (denied by the defendant) she
walked out of the meeting preceding the execution of the 1 June 1990 agreement,
even
though it was not too late, at that stage, for the venture to be
stopped.
<P>

(i)	the wholly unsatisfactory evidence of the first plaintiff concerning the
$40,000 (in bank notes of $50) which she said she contributed
in July 1990, and
which was said to represent cash held at her home and withdrawn from her bank
in  instalments, between 5 February
1990 and 13 July 1990.  The unexplained
absence of the critical pass sheets, the state of the balance in that account,
and the ultimate
withdrawal of this claim, seriously undermine this party's
credibility, as does the withdrawal of her earlier claim that all of the
monies
paid by Emery Park to BCE in respect of the construction of the units was
misappropriated by the defendant.
<P>

(j)	the claim of the first plaintiff to the effect that the defendant
misappropriated portion of the proceeds of the sale of Unit
3, and her
eventual concession (despite earlier evidence to the contrary) that she had
known of the manner in which the $50,000 was
used, when viewed in the light of
documentary records, the sale price for other units, and the Jones v Dunkel
inference mentioned
above.
<P>

(k)	the first plaintiff's reluctance to accept that Mr. Hilaire, an independent
professional quantity surveyor,  had in fact provided
her with the detailed
estimate of the costs of the building as constructed and her denial of his
account as to the request made of
him to  produce a report showing a
construction cost in the order of $1m, in the light of the contemporary
records, which tend to
show his account to have been correct.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSIONS ON LIABILITY</b>
<P>

134  	Together, these matters cause me to prefer the evidence of the
defendant where it is in conflict with the oral evidence of
the plaintiffs.
His evidence I find more likely to have fitted in with the manner in which the
venture developed, and to a significant
extent (but not wholly), to be
consistent with his contemporary diary records.
<P>

135  	Although the manner in which his contributions to the project
were calculated were somewhat favourable to him, they clearly
were accepted by
the plaintiffs, as the documentation records.  The circumstances in which the
building contract was prepared were
satisfactorily explained upon the basis
that Mercantile Credits required a lump sum contract.  The amount recorded
reflected  his
evidence as to the estimate that he said that he provided, once
he had the building plans, and was in a position to move onto this
project.
Its existence was not necessarily inconsistent with the actual costs plus
agreement which the parties signed, so far as
the lump sum was understood to be
an estimate, and so far as the contract was provided to meet the lender's
needs.
<P>

136  	So far as the plaintiffs sought to rely upon the "rule of
thumb" calculation used by the defendant for the possible Gosford
project, as
lending credibility to their assertion that a figure of $1.24m was quoted, this
is not borne out upon the figures.  A
rate of $6,000 per square equates to $645
per square metre.  Applied to Mr. Burgess' calculation of a total area of 2,150
square
metres for the Corrimal project, the cost would be as follows:
<P>

$645 x 2,150 = $1,386,750
<P>

This sum is more consistent with every other calculation made for the job, and
with the defendant's own evidence, than it is with
the plaintiffs' evidence.
<P>

137  	One matter of concern I had related to the circumstance that
the November valuation, on its face suggested that the venture
was almost
certainly bound to be unprofitable.  The obvious question arises, if that was
the case, why did the parties proceed with
it?   Is the answer that it was
withheld from the plaintiffs?  I am not persuaded that was the case.  Rather,
it seems to me, the
answer lies in the evidence of the defendant, that the
plaintiffs, most particularly the first plaintiff, who effectively carried
the
second plaintiff, took a bullish view of the likely sales values, an attitude
that was borne out by the obvious expectations
they had in this regard that
show through their evidence.
<P>

138  	Another matter of concern related to the  bank diary as to the
profit forecast, which on one view might lend support to the
plaintiffs'
account of the profits that the defendant held out as anticipated.  The answer,
however, lies in the fact that this document
was made two years after the
September 1989 discussions, and hence is not corroborative of anything that had
been held out at that
time.  Moreover, it is equivocal as to whether the
defendant was speaking to the bank, of the profit to the venture as a whole or
to the defendant alone,
<P>

139  	In order to make out their claim in tort, the plaintiffs have
to show that the defendant was negligent in any advice given
concerning the
construction costs and expected sales, for example in not making sufficient
inquiries or investigations, and also
that the estimates given were in fact
those that they alleged he supplied;  and/or that he negligently omitted to
disclose the November
1989 valuation to them.
<P>

140  	To make good the claim for breach of a fiduciary duty, they
have to establish that the defendant failed to act in good faith
in the supply
of information to them concerning his estimate of the construction costs and
sales values, and/or in withholding the
November valuation, and/or in so acting
generally in relation to the venture as to encourage them to go ahead with it,
for the collateral
purpose of enriching himself.
<P>

141  	In the circumstances outlined above, I am not persuaded that
there was any breach of the duty of care owed under general law,
or of the
fiduciary duty owed concerning either the advice given pre contract as to the
construction costs or likely sales return,
and profitability of the venture, or
concerning disclosure of the November 1989 valuation.
<P>

142  	In particular, since I prefer the defendant's version to that
of the plaintiffs, I am not persuaded that he ever quoted any
figure other than
the "$1.4m, to $1.45m plus or minus 10%" that he said he gave in about February
1995.  Nor am I persuaded that
he ever gave any firm estimates of a total sales
value in the sum of $2.4m.  or of the likely profits to each partner.
Additionally,
I am not persuaded that he withheld the November valuation from
the plaintiffs.  On the contrary, I accept his evidence that he discussed
it
with the first plaintiff, and that she said that the sale estimates were too
low.  Its inclusion within the Coopers &amp; Lybrand
material when inspected in
1992, is inconsistent with any attempt by the defendant to conceal it.
Moreover, in view of the later
valuations obtained for subsequent draw downs,
any such suppression would have been likely to have proved fatal.
<P>

143  	The plaintiffs' claim accordingly fails, and it is unnecessary
to deal with their claim for damages, save to note that the
amounts claimed
(variously as tortious damages or as equitable compensation in accordance with
the principles stated in <u>United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital
Products International Pty Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20766" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 766</a> at 816) were as
follows:
<P>

<u>First Plaintiff</u>
<P>

Cost of the land				$204,458
<P>

Cash contributions			$<u>120,000</u>
<P>

						$324,458
<P>

<u>Second Plaintiff</u>
<P>

Cash contributions			$25,000
<P>

So claimed, the damages were confined to the monies which the plaintiffs lost
in the venture, ie the monies outlaid for the land
and for their development
contributions, all having been wholly absorbed in the costs of construction,
receivership and winding up.
<P>

144  	If I am in error in my assessment of the factual issues, and
they should be found as the plaintiffs contend, then these claims
would in my
view be made good.  In that respect, it would be proper to find the relevant
issues of causation in the plaintiffs' favour.
<P>

145  	There will be a verdict for the Defendant.   I will hear
further argument as to costs.
<P>
