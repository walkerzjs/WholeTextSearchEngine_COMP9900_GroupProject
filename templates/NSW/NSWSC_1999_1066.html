FRIDAY 25 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>1945/92 - IOLANDA HOARE  v  EDWARD DUBOIS (ESTATE OF THE LATE JOHN
SMYTH)</b>
<P>

<b>1510/99 - EDWARD GEORGE DUBOIS  v  ISABELLA HODGSON &amp; 3 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in
respect of the estate of the late John Smyth who died on 6 January 1991.  The
deceased was survived by the plaintiff who had lived
with him for many
years.
<P>

2  	The deceased was also survived by Isabella Hodgson who had lived
with the deceased for a short time prior to his death.  There
is some
suggestion in the evidence of Isabella that the deceased may have had a
wife.
<P>

3  	Further evidence has been given by the plaintiff who, it will be
appreciated from what I say later, had lived with the deceased
from the mid
1960s. 
<P>

4  	According to her the deceased in fact never had a wife and he
joked on one occasion about how no one would ever have him.  
<P>

5  	In the circumstances it would seem to me that it is safe to
assume that he did not have a wife but even if he did the estate
is of such a
size that any such claim from a former wife may well be accommodated.  In any
event, the claim would be substantially
discounted because it must relate to
some relationship prior to the 1960s, more than thirty years before the death
of the deceased.

<P>

6  	Other relevant people who take under the deceased's will are the
plaintiff's daughter, Yvonne Hoare, and the defendant, who
was a friend of the
deceased for a few years prior to his death.
<P>

7  	The estate of the deceased is substantial.  At the time of
probate it was valued at $2,220,874.52.  It is now presently valued
at some
$3,162,970.80  The major assets are real estate and their value is as
follows:
<P>

A   71 Helen Street, Sefton 		           $    210,000
<P>

B   344 Albury Street, Murrumburrah -

<P>

H   34 pacific Highway, Mooney Mooney             280,000
<P>

8  	Other assets which the deceased has include an interest in the
estate of his step brother Alex Felby of $169,713.47 and there
are various
moneys on deposit and shares of between $60,000 and $70,000.  
<P>

9  	The will of the deceased was a home-made will.  There has been a
construction suit in respect of that will which I heard the
day before
yesterday and I gave judgment yesterday on the result of that suit.   I will
not repeat the matters that I dealt with
in it but reference can be made to
that judgment for the background for the provisions of the will of the
deceased.
<P>

10  	Having regard to the result of the construction suit, the
position of the beneficiaries before payment of costs, expenses and
any further
provision for the plaintiff is as follows:

11  	There are a number of proceedings including the construction
suit and there are substantial costs in this regard.  There have
also been
expenses relating to the maintenance of particular assets.  In particular
Church Point, which is an asset having a value
of $2 million, has required
moneys to be spent on it and I determined yesterday in my judgment that those
particular expenses should
be born by the asset in question.  If one deducts or
allocates to the particular properties the relevant expenses and if one takes
the costs of the proceedings to date, including the defendants' costs of these
proceedings, out of residue, the net position of the
beneficiaries is as
follows:
<P>

<b>	ISABELLA </b>
<P>

(Subject to payment of future rent)
<b>300,000.00</b>
<P>

<b>IOLANDA</b>
    <b>183,316.00</b>
<P>

12  	It can be seen from the above that substantially residue has
borne the whole of the costs of the defendant in these proceedings
and the
costs of all the other parties to the construction suit.
<P>

13  	The provision for Iolanda, the plaintiff, includes the sum of
$718,616 which is the net rental which has been received from
the Harden shops
since the date of death and of this she has already received about $46,000.
<P>

14  	There will be some other costs if an order is made in favour of
the plaintiff and these would probably be in the order of some
$48,000.  In the
ordinary course those costs will fall on residue and there is still sufficient
residue to meet those costs.
<P>

15  	It is necessary to put a little of chronology in context.  The
plaintiff was born on 19 January 1921 at Ciate in Italy.  She
is now aged
seventy-eight.  In 1948 she migrated to England and married the following year.
Their daughter Yvonne was born on 22
October 1949.  
<P>

16  	Little is known or given in the evidence of the early life of
the deceased.  What we do know is that on 29 September 1959 the
deceased and
his half brother, Alex Filby, purchased a property at Church Point as joint
tenants.
<P>

17  	In 1960 the plaintiff and her family emigrated to Australia and
she separated from her husband shortly thereafter.   She met
the deceased.  At
that time he was living at Leichhardt and she was living at Carlton.  On 22
September 1997 the deceased purchased
a property at Mooney Mooney.  It is
apparent that the deceased and the plaintiff moved into that property and at
least from this
time they commenced a de facto relationship.
<P>

18  	Thereafter the deceased commenced painting and he started his
business of picture framing.  In June 1971 the deceased acquired
a property at
71 Helen Street, Sefton.  The deceased and the plaintiff moved into that
property and thereafter for a while Mooney
Mooney was used as a weekender and
some time later it was rented.
<P>

19  	The deceased seemed to have been able to acquire properties
probably using rental and also the income from his business.  In
1969 the
deceased purchased 60 Walton Road, Chester Hill in which he and the plaintiff
set up a picture framing and art business.
 The plaintiff worked in the
business at that location.
<P>

20  	A business name was obtained and the business conducted as Fine
Art Picture Framing.  It was in 1973 that the actual transfer
of 96 Walton Road
was made to the deceased.  Apparently in 1970 there was a purchase of
Torrington Avenue. It might have been a little
bit after but around 1975 they
moved into the property.  At that time a deed was executed which provided for
the transfer of that
property to the plaintiff.  The deed was expressed to be
in consideration of the work which the plaintiff had done in the business
of
the deceased for some years prior to that date and there was also provision for
some payments under the deed which apparently
were not made or otherwise taken
into account between the parties. 
<P>

21  	For a while in 1977 and 1979 the plaintiff conducted a gallery
but eventually that stopped and at some stage, probably in the
early 1980s,
there was a shop leased at Mona Vale and the deceased, with the help of the
plaintiff, conducted a picture framing business
in those premises as well.
<P>

22  	By 1980 the deceased had finished paying off Torrington Avenue
and it was transferred to him.  Pursuant to the arrangements
of the 1975 deed,
the property was transferred to the plaintiff on 4 November 1993.
<P>

23  	In 1988, the plaintiff's step brother, who had obviously used
the Church Point resident as his home, became disabled.  He had
a stroke moved
from Church Point to the property, 71 Helen Street, Sefton.  He died on 13 May
1989. 
<P>

24  	Some time prior to this, the deceased had met Isabella Hodgson.
This was put by her as in 1986.  Apparently they both attended
a church, being
the Assembly of God, and would meet each weekend at church.  At that stage
Isabella was living in a flat at Parramatta.
 In mid-1990 the deceased was
diagnosed with cancer of the liver and admitted to hospital.
<P>

25  	Isabella's situation also changed because on 5 June 1990 she was
retrenched from her job at Parramatta.  It seems that after
coming out of
hospital for the first time the deceased then went and lived with Isabella at
the property at Helen Street, Sefton.
<P>

26  	The deceased made his last will on 14 September 1990 and died on
5 January 1991.  Probate was granted in 1992 and the proceedings
commenced
within time.  During the extraordinary length of time it has taken these
proceedings to come on for trial, the property
at 146 Neill Street, Harden was
destroyed by fire.  Apparently it was not insured.  
<P>

27  	There were proceedings apparently before Cohen J brought by the
plaintiff to enforce her entitlement under the will.  On 20
March 1998 consent
orders were made for the payments and transfers to her.  Those transfers have
not yet occurred so she has not
yet received the Harden properties as required
by those orders.
<P>

28  	It is necessary for the plaintiff to establish that she is an
eligible person.  Even on the plaintiff's case she was not living
in a de facto
relationship with the deceased at the date of death and accordingly it is
necessary for her to have been part of the
household and dependent upon the
deceased.  Clearly, in the admitted circumstances of this case, that
applies.
<P>

29  	There is a dispute about the end of the period when she was
living with the deceased.  According to Isabella he ceased living
with her in
1989, some months after the death of Alex but, even if one takes the deceased
as having lived with the plaintiff up until
that time, there is clear evidence
of the plaintiff being part of the household and dependent upon the
deceased.
<P>

30  	It is necessary under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9(1)</a> to see whether there are factors
warranting the making of the application.  The evidence that I have referred to
is subject to one
qualification, namely, that there are submissions that have
been made that perhaps the relationship of the deceased and the plaintiff
started to deteriorate in the early 1980s.
<P>

31  	Be that as it may, the situation still is that the plaintiff was
the deceased's de facto spouse from 1967 for a long time.
  It is also clear
that she made contributions to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of
the property through her work
in the business.  She obviously was the homemaker
and effective wife of the deceased. 
<P>

32  	In these circumstances it seems to me that there are appropriate
factors warranting the making of the application and indeed
that is not
disputed in respect of the proceedings.
<P>

33  	In applications under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></b> the High
Court has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the
two-stage approach that a court must take.  At page 209 it said the
following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-sage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

34  	I turn to consider the position of the plaintiff.  She is aged
seventy-eight and although married was separated from her husband
at a time
prior to her commencing her relationship with the deceased.  Her daughter is
not dependent upon her.  Her present assets
are as follows: she has the house
at 9 Grafton Avenue, Sefton which has a value at $190,000.  She has a
half-share in a house in
George Street, Gayley which she owned with her husband
and her half-share is worth $30,000.  He resides in that and it is his home
since he has retired.  She has furniture of some $2500 and moneys in the bank
of $13,600.  
<P>

35  	Importantly it should be noted that the house which she has at
Torrington Avenue, Sefton is not in a good state.  In the will
she received
some $12,000 to fix the roof but, even leaving that aside, the building
inspection report indicates the many defects
in the house and substantial costs
which would be involved in fixing it.  Clearly it is old and not in good
condition.
<P>

36  	She exists on the pension of $350 per fortnight and manages to
cover her expenses.  She does not have any substantial expenses.
 She is not in
good health and has suffered from dislocated hips from birth.  She has had
three operations in Italy and says she
may need other operations on her hips.
As a result she cannot walk very far and she was very dependent on the deceased
during her
lifetime for transport.  The difficulty she has with walking was
obvious in Court.  She has to use taxis as she finds it difficult
to use public
transport and she has difficulty walking up and down stairs.
<P>

37  	It is necessary to deal with the relationship between the
plaintiff and the defendant in order to form a view as to what is
an
appropriate provision.  The difficulty in the case is that the plaintiff was
not a very satisfactory witness.  At times she was
evasive in the witness box.
She was also argumentative and advocated her case.  At times she changed her
evidence from what was in
her affidavit evidence and thought of matters that
had not been put in the affidavit.  She did not properly address critical
questions
when they touched upon her case, such as questions about from where
the deceased was taken to hospital.
<P>

38  	Be that as it may, the Court has to look at what evidence there
is to try to determine when the relationship finished.  There
is no doubt about
the start of it and I am satisfied that the de facto relationship commenced
when the deceased and the plaintiff
started living together at Mooney Mooney.
The plaintiff's version of what happened at the end of the relationship is set
out in paragraphs
21 to 24 of her affidavit of 8 October 1998.
<P>

39  	Effectively, she says that just before the deceased left
Westmead Hospital after his first treatment he said to her that he
was going to
go to Helen Street rather than come back to the plaintiff.  He said that he
wanted to have his friends with him. 
<P>

40  	This apparently was a reference to Isabella, her family and
others no doubt in the group in which the deceased was mixing.
<P>

41  	Apparently he continued, on the plaintiff's version, still
living at Helen Street and on one occasion about six months before
the deceased
died she visited there and saw another woman who, apparently, was Isabella
Hodgson. 
<P>

42  	The plaintiff occasionally visited the deceased thereafter in
hospital and last saw him at the hospital about Christmas time
in 1990.
<P>

43  	Isabella's story is set out in her affidavit.  In essence she
says that after having met the deceased she had also at some
stage met Alex.
Initially she was a friend of Alex but came also to know the deceased fairly
well.
<P>

44  	She says that after Alex died on 13 May 1989 the deceased moved
to live with Isabella, her son and daughter in a unit at Parramatta
where they
had moved. She talks of him purchasing a microwave oven, a refrigerator and a
freezer.
<P>

45  	She also says that it was on 5 June that she was retrenched from
her employment and her son had gone back to New Zealand. 
She says that there
were discussions between the deceased, herself and her daughter.  As a result
the three of them moved out of
the flat into the deceased's property at Helen
Street, Sefton.
<P>

46  	In other words the suggestion is that there was a relationship
between Isabella and the deceased from some time after the middle
of 1989 until
the date of death.  Even on the plaintiff's story it would seem clear that
there was such a relationship, certainly
from the middle of 1990.
<P>

47  	It is difficult to precisely resolve this matter.  There are
some other items of evidence, for instance, the defendant, Mr
Dubois, has given
evidence of what he observed at the shop from 1988 onwards and that gives some
insight into the assistance the
deceased was giving to his half brother and the
fact the plaintiff was not working at the shop.  Mr Dubois was in fact in the
next
door premises to the deceased's shop.  
<P>

48  	There is other evidence of an occasion when the husband of the
plaintiff was picked up by the deceased and taken to Moss Vale
to obtain a car
which had apparently broken down. 
<P>

49  	The evidence he gives of picking up Isabella at Parramatta would
perhaps indicate the deceased was not living there. 
<P>

50  	The submissions that have been put suggest that there may have
been an earlier break down in the relationship.  
<P>

51  	Particular reference is made to the terms of the 1975 deed
suggesting that perhaps there was some suggestion of parties each
going their
own way.  I do not think that is the case.  The plaintiff's evidence is that
she continued working for a long time after
1975 when the deed was signed. 
<P>

52  	Another person who gave evidence was the husband of the
plaintiff.  Admittedly they are separated but he seems fairly clear
that in
1990 the plaintiff and the deceased were still together.
<P>

53  	In these circumstances it seems to me that it is likely that the
relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased had commenced
to break
down, certainly in 1989.  If that had not happened one would not find the
sudden change that occurred in the middle of 1990.
 It is not as though there
is a specific event that precipitated the leaving.  Whether or not Isabella was
in fact living in a de
facto relationship is hard to determine.  I am satisfied
that she was living in such a relationship from the middle of 1990 onwards.
Obviously she was a friend to and assisted the deceased in the period to his
death.  
<P>

54  	There is evidence from the plaintiff of her working in the
deceased's business, certainly for a period up until the early 1980s.
 Given
the evidence of the defendant, it seems that the work in the business had
ceased by at least 1988.  However, all this work
was done without any
recompense apart from the transfer of the Torrington Road property in 1975.  It
certainly continued on for a
long period after that.  There is no doubt that
such assistance, together with the rentals which the deceased had from various
properties,
enabled him to build up his assets. 
<P>

55  	It is necessary to look and see how the plaintiff says that she
has been left without adequate and proper provision for her
maintenance,
education and advancement in life.
<P>

56  	She has a property at Torrington Road, Sefton which is in bad
repair and needs work doing to it.  She quite frankly talks of
wanting to move
to the seaside and buying a unit at Manly.  The reason for that is expressed to
be so that her daughter could visit
her but, given that her daughter is living
in Coogee, that does not seem to be a valid reason.  However, she does wish to
move away
from Sefton and acquire a unit at that place.  Her daughter supports
that move.  To acquire a unit there would require the expenditure
of between
$350,000 and $590,000, depending upon the unit purchased.  The lower end
relates to older style units and the higher to
newer style units. 
<P>

57  	It is necessary to consider also the situation of others having
a claim on the bounty of the deceased.  In the present case
there are a number
and the first I will deal with is Yvonne. 
<P>

58  	She is fifty and is single and has no dependants.  She has no
assets, apart from some furniture  and personal effects.  She
has debts of some
$4500 and has difficulties with work and her medical condition.  In 1992 in
Queensland she contracted Ross River
fever.  That left her unable to work and
on sickness benefits for over a year.  She was then unemployed for two years.
That has left
her with a disability of arthritis in her feet, neck, back and
hands which causes her considerable pain. 
<P>

59  	She needs to have a job which enables her to sit for a while and
then stand and move around.  She had one but that has been
lost and she now
survives on a Newstart allowance of some $305 per fortnight.  A report from
Doctor Deakin deals with her disabilities.
<P>

60  	The doctor indicates that because of her difficulties she can
only work part-time in a capacity that permits some flexibility
in her work
activities.  He talks about the fact that the arthritis is degenerative and
will worsen with age.  He also indicates
that any treatment is not likely to
have a dramatic impact on her condition.  Clearly, she is in fairly
straightened circumstances.

<P>

61  	Yvonne has had a fairly close contact with the deceased.  She
was twenty-one when they were living at Mooney Mooney and obviously
was taken
in as part of the family by the deceased.  Although she was overseas between
1978 and 1981 she continued contact with the
deceased after that time.
<P>

62  	The deceased was particularly supportive when she commenced
university studies in 1987 and bought her a computer in order to
help her in
her Honours year.
<P>

63  	She also apparently fulfilled some role in the life of the
deceased in that the deceased would ask her to ring and check to
see how he was
from time to time.  Another matter that indicates the closeness between them
was the fact that the deceased certainly
discussed with Yvonne what he intended
to do with his property on his death.  He initially indicated that he was going
to leave the
whole of Church Point to Yvonne's mother, the plaintiff.
<P>

64  	At another stage he suggested that he might leave her half the
Church Point property.  She was non committal because she was
surprised and did
not want to talk about such matters.
<P>

65  	There was then a later conversation when he indicated that he
was thinking of leaving Church Point half to her and half to
Isabella.  Clearly
there has been a long contact over a period with Yvonne.  
<P>

66  	Mr Dubois is a friend of the deceased.  His friendship goes back
to 1988 when he started to work next door and his circumstances
are not
particularly outstanding.  He has a house, a property at Regents Park, worth
$180,000 upon which he has a mortgage of some
$90,000.  He has a 1983 Sigma
vehicle worth $1600, a leased truck with a value of $6000, stock in his
business of $40,000 and some
insurance policies.  His income per year is
modest, being $35,000 and this comes from the furniture business which he runs
at 96
Walton Road, Chester Hill.  That is, of course, part of the estate
property and in the will he is to receive the premises after the
death of
Isabella but in the meantime is to pay rent indexed with the CPI.  The present
rent that he pays is $11,851.  In the event
that he pre-deceases Isabella the
property would pass, according to his will, to his next of kin or to those whom
he might specify.
<P>

67  	Clearly, his circumstances are ordinary and fairly modest.  His
relationship with the deceased was as a friend and I have referred
to this.
<P>

68  	The other person to whom consideration has to be given is
Isabella Hodgson.  She had a large family of children originally
and that
marriage has finished.   She had another short marriage which is also finished.
All her children are not dependent upon
her although one of her daughters is
living with her now.  She has no assets of any substance and is in good health,
apart from her
hearing.  
<P>

69  	So far as her relationship with the deceased is concerned, I
think I have dealt with this earlier.  I accept they were friends
from 1986.
From the latter half of 1984 she formed a relationship with the deceased which
ultimately, in mid-1990, became a de facto
relationship.
<P>

70  	The balancing of these claims is always a difficult matter.  One
must bear in mind that the deceased was not married but for
a substantial part
of his life he lived with the plaintiff in a de facto relationship.
Effectively it was of about twenty-two years'
duration.  
<P>

71  	Widows' claims are frequently the subject of applications in
this Court.  The Court of Appeal in <b>Goloski v Goloski</b> (unreported 5
October 1993) has referred to formulations of this standard to be expected in
respect of a widow in terms which refer
to the decision of Powell J in
<b>Luciano v Rosenblum</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65</a> and <b>Elliott v Elliott</b>,
which was approved by the Court of Appeal on 24 April 1986.  There his Honour
said:
<P>

"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and harmonious,
where the widow has loyally supported her husband
and assisted him to build up
and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no
less than to the extent
to which his assets permit him to achieve that result;
first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for the rest of her life
and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have the
capacity to change her home; secondly, that she have available
to her an income
sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and free
from any financial worry; and, third,
that she have available to her a fund to
which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such modest
luxuries as she
might choose and which would provide her with a hedge against
any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring."
<P>

72  	Here, as we have seen, there is a long relationship and there
has been a contribution to the estate of the deceased.  In part
it has been
recognised in 1975 but there is obviously a period after that, probably running
up until the mid-1980s, when there was
further help and assistance by the
plaintiff in the deceased's business.  Although she has Torrington Street,
probably it would be
preferable for her to sell it and move.  Her desire to
move to Manly is one which I do not doubt is real on her part.  Whether it
is
appropriate is another matter.  Clearly, however, the plaintiff does need some
contingency and she needs housing.  The evidence
does not really address in
detail her income needs and the submission that was made on behalf of the
plaintiff was that she should
receive a legacy of some $2 million.  That
submission was put on the express instructions of the plaintiff.  Clearly, that
is not
appropriate.  What is appropriate is that the plaintiff should have some
sum to purchase new accommodation.
<P>

73  	There is probably no reason why it should not be in the Manly
area.  The estate is a large one and the question of what is
an appropriate
provision in respect of a large estate is dealt with by Young J in <b>Anasson v
Phillips</b>, 4 March 1988, where he said the following:
<P>

"... with a very large estate ... there is a great temptation on a court to be
over-generous with other people's money.  This is
especially so when the court
can see that plaintiffs have been very hardly done by at the hands of a
domineering testatrix.  However,
the case should not be approached in this way
as the application has to be determined in accordance with the legal
principles.  These
principles include the fact that in Australia there is
freedom of a person to leave her property in whatever way she wishes, to love
whom she wishes, to hate whom she wishes and there is only when there has been
a failure to comply with a moral duty to those who
in the community's eyes she
should have made proper provision for, that anyone can legally complain about
another person's will.
 Even then, the court has no power to re-write the will,
but can only adjust things, in substitution for the testatrix, in such a
way as
to fulfil her moral duty.
<P>

74  	If the estate is a large one, the court has a slightly different
approach.  The basic principles are the same, that is, the
will can only be
affected to the extent that it is necessary to discharge the moral duty by
making adequate provision for the plaintiffs,
but where there is a large
estate, competition between claimant and claimant, and claimant and beneficiary
under the will is much
reduced or eliminated.  Further, there may be a more
liberal assessment of the moral duty owed, to be reflected in what is proper
provision for the plaintiffs.  IN particular, the lifestyle that has been
enjoyed by the plaintiffs, because they have been associated
with a wealth
testatrix is a relevant factor.  These principles all, I think, flow from cases
such as <b>Re Buckland</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1966/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] VicRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20VR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) VR 404</a>, especially at page 412."
<P>

75  	If the plaintiff sells her property at Torrington Road and
receives $190,000, she will have that plus she will have the estate
properties
worth a little over $100,000 which produce an income at the moment.  That would
be a fund and it would no doubt help supplement
her income.
<P>

76  	When one looks at the evidence, clearly a reasonable unit can be
purchased for something under $600,000 and the plaintiff probably,
given the
largeness of the estate, ought to have some flexibility in choosing a unit
which would suit her, particularly in her advanced
years.  She should also have
a reasonable sum to provide for contingencies and supplement her income.
<P>

77  	One of the things that needs to be considers is where the burden
of the legacy will fall.  The defendant, Mr Dubois, is not
in an extravagant
situation.  His situation is modest and he, under the terms of the will, will
be paying $11,000 a year to Isabella.
 That is something additional that
Isabella has even if, for instance, her provision is substantially reduced.

<P>

78  	Yvonne has the difficulties that I have referred to. She has had
a long association with the deceased since her late childhood
and she was
obviously close to him.  Her health causes her enormous difficulties and will
continue to do so and she will have great
problems obtaining employment.
<P>

79  	So far as Isabella is concerned, the relationship that she had
with the deceased was no doubt of great assistance to the deceased.
 Clearly
they had their life together for the short time left, at least as a de facto
couple for six months and probably as an assisting
friend for somewhat
longer.
<P>

80  	However, the provision in the will of just under $1.4 million
seems to be out of all proportion.. Even if some substantial
legacy is given in
favour of the plaintiff out of Isabella's share, Isabella will still have, for
instance, the property at Helen
Street, Sefton and funds left over.  
<P>

81  	Given the extent of the estate and given the position of the
other beneficiaries, who are Yvonne and the defendant, it seems
to me that the
burden of an additional legacy which I should give should be borne by the share
of Isabella which she receives from
the Church Point property.
<P>

82  	Accordingly, the orders that I make are as follows:
<P>

1.	In addition to the provisions that the plaintiff receives under the will of
the deceased, the plaintiff is to receive a legacy
of $600,000 which is to be
paid out of the half-share of the deceased's Church Point property bequeathed
to Isabella Hodgson.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff's costs on as party and party basis and the defendant's on an
indemnity basis are to be paid or retained out of
the estate of the deceased.
As I have indicated earlier, the costs will come out of residue.
<P>

83  	On the question of interest the property will have to be sold to
enable the legacy to be paid and, accordingly, I order that
interest under s
83A of the Wills Probate and Administration Act should run on the legacy if not
paid within three months of today's
date.
<P>

84  	The other matter that was raised is the question of enforcement
of the orders, the only evidence that is before me is that
there has been a
delay from 1991 until the present time when these proceedings have come on for
hearing.  It is quite extraordinary.
 It was necessary for orders to be made
for the plaintiff to receive particular properties and they have not yet been
transferred.
<P>

85  	Normally in the event of there being no proper payment, it would
be usual for the beneficiary to start proceedings for administration.
 However,
what I will do is reserve liberty to apply in respect of enforcement in case
that is of assistance.
