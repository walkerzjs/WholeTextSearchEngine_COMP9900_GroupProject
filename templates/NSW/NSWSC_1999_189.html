<b>3001/97	JOHN NEVILLE WINTOUR &amp; ORS  v  </b>
<P>

<b>		HERBERT BONNEY</b>
<P>

<b>4322/97 	LUANNA WINTOUR &amp; ANOR  v  </b>
<P>

<b>		HERBERT BONNEY</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> There are before me two sets of proceedings, each
<P>

	under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i> 1982</a>.  
<P>

2	By summons 3001 of 1997 John Neville Wintour seeks, in effect, an order for
provision for his maintenance, education and advancement
in life out of the
estate of his late father Neville Henry Wintour (to whom I shall refer as "the
deceased").
<P>

3	By summons 4322 of 1997 the plaintiffs Luanna Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong
each seeks an order for provision for her respective
maintenance and
advancement in life out of the estate and/or the notional estate of the
deceased.  Each of those plaintiffs is a
daughter of the deceased.  
<P>

4	Subsequently, on 2 February 1999, the Court made orders that Edna Florence
Wintour and Arnold Charles Wintour, Maryanne Armstrong
and Luanna Wintour be
joined as plaintiffs in the proceedings 3001 of 1997, an order that proceedings
4322 of 1997 be joined and
heard with proceedings 3001 of 1997.
<P>

5	Edna Florence Wintour is the widow of the deceased.  Arnold Charles Wintour
is another son of the deceased.  He was an adopted
child of the deceased but
the fact of his adoption does not have any effect upon his status as a child of
the deceased.
<P>

6	The deceased died on 1 January 1996 aged sixty-seven years.  Probate of his
will dated 20 July 1993 was, on 15 July 1996, granted
to the defendant Herbert
Bonney, who was the executor named in such will.  That grant was re-sealed in
Queensland on 18 October 1996.
 
<P>

7	The deceased was survived by his widow and by his four children (each of
those persons being now a plaintiff in one or other of
the two sets of
proceedings).  The deceased, by his will, purported to give his interest in
certain property at 18 Creek Street,
Hastings Point to his widow.  In fact, it
appears that that property was held by the deceased and Edna Florence Winter as
joint tenants,
and in consequence the interest of the deceased in the property
passes by survivorship to his widow and not in consequence of the
provisions of
the will.  
<P>

8	The deceased, also by his will, gave to his widow a certain motor vehicle,
gave to another beneficiary what is described as "my
dredge and all dredging
pipes", and gave to his sons, John and Arnold, all his tools of trade and
workshop equipment.  
<P>

9	Clause 7 of the will is in the following terms:
<P>

	I direct that my trustee shall sell my land known as Lot 156 in deposited plan
628026 and from the proceeds of that land to pay
all my funeral and
testamentary expenses and to divide the proceeds in the following manner:
one-third of the net proceeds to be
paid to wife Edna Florence Wintour,
two-thirds of the net proceeds to be paid to Arnold Charles Wintour, John
Neville Wintour, Maryanne
Armstrong and Luanna Wintour for their sole use and
benefit absolutely.
<P>

10	However, the gift contained in clause 7 adeemed, since the deceased during
his lifetime had disposed of the land referred to
in that clause.  Apparently
the deceased lent the proceeds of sale of that land upon a registered mortgage
to a company called Tweed
Coast Developments Limited, which, in due course, has
gone into liquidation.  The interest of the deceased in that asset is now the
interest of a mortgagee in possession.  However, the ultimate benefit to the
estate in practical terms is uncertain.  
<P>

11	The will does not contain any provision concerning residue. It follows
therefore that the interest of the deceased in the mortgage
to which I have
just referred, which is by far the most significant asset in the estate (having
a value which, in the most general
terms, has been estimated to be within the
range of between $1 million and $3 million), now passes upon partial intestacy.
The effect
of the provisions of the <i>Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act
</i>1898</a> concerning that partial intestacy is to give to the widow of the
deceased a significantly greater share in that asset than she would
receive if
the deceased had still retained the property which was the subject of clause 7
of the will.  By the same token, the entitlement
of each of the four children
of the deceased upon intestacy in respect to the only significant asset in the
estate would be considerably
less than the benefit which the deceased intended
each of those children to receive in the land which was the subject of clause 7
of the will.  
<P>

12	Each of the plaintiffs is an eligible person in relation to the deceased
within one or other of paragraphs (a) or (b) of the
definition of that phrase
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  The plaintiff,
Edna Florence Wintour, as the widow of the deceased is an eligible person
within paragraph (a) of that definition.
 Each of the other plaintiffs, John
Neville Wintour, Arnold Charles Wintour, Luanna Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong,
as a child of
the deceased, is an eligible person within paragraph (b) of that
definition.  As such an eligible person each of the plaintiffs has
the standing
to bring the present proceedings.  
<P>

13	Apart from the five plaintiffs the only other eligible person in relation to
the deceased is Melanie Wintour, the former wife
of the deceased.  A Notice of
Claim, as required by the Supreme Court Rules, was served upon her by the
defendant.  She has not sought
to make any claim against the estate of the
deceased.  It follows, therefore, that the five plaintiffs are the only persons
whose
interests in the estate of the deceased must be considered by the Court
(apart from the beneficiary Geoffrey William Wallen who,
under the terms of the
will, receives the deceased's dredge and dredging pipes).
<P>

14	Although the first set of proceedings was instituted on 26 June 1997 and
although those proceedings came before the Registrar
on seven separate
occasions between 29 September 1998 and 2 January 1999, the defendant executor
filed the affidavit required by
Part 77 Rule 59 of the Rules, being his
affidavit sworn 27 November 1998, only on 15 February 1999.  He had, shortly
before then,
on 2 February 1999, filed his affidavit sworn 27 January 1999.
The defendant had in fact been ordered on 15 December 1998 to pay
the costs of
the then plaintiff in proceedings 3001 of 1997 and of the beneficiaries Arnold
Charles Wintour, Edna Florence Wintour,
Luanna Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong,
those costs be paid personally by the defendant and not from the estate of the
deceased. 

<P>

15	The various plaintiffs are, as I have indicated, the only significant
beneficiaries in the estate of the deceased.  They are
the only persons
entitled to share upon the partial intestacy the only significant asset in the
estate of the deceased.  They are
the only eligible persons, apart from the
former wife of the deceased (who, although served with notice of the
proceedings, has chosen
not to make any claim against the estate of the
deceased).  
<P>

16	It emerges from the evidence that the five present plaintiffs were desirous
of arranging amongst themselves that the only significant
asset in the estate
--- which in the events which have happened passes upon intestacy --- should
pass, not in accordance with the
relevant provisions of Division 2A of the
<i>Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act</a></i>, but in the manner in which the
deceased himself clearly decided was appropriate, that is, that his widow
should receive one-third
of that asset and the remaining two-thirds should be
divided among his four children (that is, that each of those four children
would
receive one-sixth of that asset).
<P>

17	The defendant executor, for reasons best known to himself, chose not to
facilitate effect being given to the arrangement agreed
upon by the only
persons who had any interest in that asset of the deceased.  It is difficult to
resist the conclusion, when one
looks at the procedural history of the matter
and also at the contents of the two affidavits filed by the executor, that the
defendant
executor was deliberately choosing to obstruct the resolution of
these proceedings.  Indeed, when the matter came before me two days
ago, on 9
March 1999, the defendant, who was then represented by a solicitor, informed
the Court through his solicitor that he neither
consented to nor opposed the
relief sought.  I, on that occasion, specially fixed the hearing of each of the
two sets of proceedings
for this day, 11 March 1999, before myself.  
<P>

18	At today's hearing the defendant executor was represented by Counsel, who
informed the Court that the defendant maintained the
attitude that he neither
consented to nor opposed the claims of each of the plaintiffs.  The executor
has no beneficial interest
in the estate - indeed, in his affidavit of 27
January 1999 the defendant expressly states, "I have no material or pecuniary
interest
in the estate of the deceased person". In the light of that fact I
find the attitude adopted by the defendant to be somewhat curious.
 He has a
responsibility as executor to administer the estate in accordance with the
provisions of the will of the deceased and,
in the event, also in accordance
with the rules relating to devolution upon partial intestacy.
<P>

19	The responsibilities of the executor are to the persons entitled under that
will and upon such intestacy. Where, as here, each
of those persons is of full
age and legal capacity and where they have, as here, expressly requested the
executor to participate
with them in achieving the making of orders by the
Court to give to each of those beneficiaries the interest which that
beneficiary
would have received under the will if the gift of the real estate
contained in clause 7 had not adeemed, one wonders for whose benefit
or in
whose interest the executor is acting when he chooses not thus to co-operate
with the entirety of the beneficiaries.  
<P>

20	The five plaintiffs have agreed upon orders which they request the Court to
make. Those orders are set forth in a document entitled
Terms of Settlement
dated 9 March 1999 which has been signed by the respective solicitors for each
of the five plaintiffs.  That
document is exhibit A in the present proceedings.

<P>

21	The effect of that document is that the widow would receive less than her
entitlement upon intestacy.  To that extent, therefore,
the claim brought by
the widow as a plaintiff jointed in proceedings 3001 of 1997 must be
dismissed.
<P>

22	Each of the other four plaintiffs has demonstrated some need.  
<P>

23	It does not seem to me that in circumstances such as these the Court
requires a great deal of persuasion before making an order
for provision along
the lines which each of the persons beneficially entitled seeks should be made.

<P>

24	I have referred to the date upon which the summons in proceedings 3001 of
1997 was filed, being 26 June 1997.   That summons
named only one plaintiff,
John Neville Winter.  Since the deceased died on 1 January 1996 those
proceedings were brought within the
period of eighteen months after the death
of the deceased prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.

<P>

25	Proceedings 4322 of 1997, in which Luanna Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong are
the plaintiffs, were instituted by summons filed
on 8 October 1997.  That
summons was filed more than eighteen months after the death of the deceased.
The claim brought by those
two plaintiffs is about four months out of time.
Prayer 4 in the summons seeks an order for extension of time.  In support of
that
application for extension there has been filed a joint affidavit sworn by
Luanna Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong on 8 December 1998.
 That affidavit
addresses the question of why the claim of those two plaintiffs was not
instituted within the eighteen-month period
provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the Act.

<P>

26	In paragraph 3 of that affidavit the two plaintiffs say that the reason why
they did not commence the proceedings within the
prescribed period was that
following the death of the deceased there were discussions and negotiations
between various family members,
and specifically after the commencing of
proceedings by John Neville Wintour, the brother of those two plaintiffs,
negotiations continued
for a period of time.  
<P>

27	The deponents say in paragraph 4:
<P>

	As a result of those negotiations spanning from the date of our father's death
until the date of issuing of the summons on file
number 4332 of 1997 at various
times we were of the view that the matter had been resolved, but that
ultimately ended up not being
the case.
<P>

28	In paragraph 5 they say:
<P>

	In the end result the agreement that has been reached between all members of
the family is in the same terms as we thought the
matter had been resolved upon
on a number of occasions between the date of the death of our father and the
issuing of the summons
in this matter.
<P>

29	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16(3)</a> of the Act provides, 
<P>

	The Court shall not make an order under subsection (2) allowing an application
in relation to a deceased person to be made after
the expiration of the
prescribed period unless sufficient cause is shown for the application not
having been made within that period.
 
<P>

30	I am satisfied from the material in the joint affidavit of the two
plaintiffs in proceedings 4322 of 1997 that the explanation
given by them shows
sufficient cause for the application of those plaintiffs not having been made
within the prescribed period. 
Similarly, I am satisfied from that evidence
concerning the discussions and negotiations between the family members and the
view
that as a result of those negotiations from the time of the death of the
deceased until the institution of Mr John Neville Wintour's
proceedings that
not only were, Luanna Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong of the view that the
matter had been resolved but also that
the other members of the family,
including the widow of the deceased and Mr Arnold Charles Wintour, were of the
same view.
<P>

31	I am satisfied therefore that sufficient cause has been shown for those two
plaintiffs not having made their application within
the prescribed period. But,
as I have already recorded, since the claim of the widow is to be dismissed, it
is not necessary for
any order to be made extending the prescribed period for
her application.  
<P>

32	I propose however in the case of Arnold Charles Wintour, a plaintiff in
proceedings 3001 of 1997, and in the case of each of
Luanna Wintour and
Maryanne Armstrong, the plaintiffs in proceedings 4322 of 1997, to order that
leave be granted to each of those
plaintiffs to bring their claim after the
expiration of the prescribed period and that the time for the commencement of
the proceedings
by each of those plaintiffs be extended, in the case of Luanna
Wintour and Maryanne Armstrong up to and including 8 October 1997
and in the
case of Arnold Charles Wintour up to and including 2 February 1998, that being
the date when he was joined as a plaintiff
to proceedings 3001 of 1997. 
<P>

33	I propose also to make an order along the lines of paragraph 1 in the
document entitled Terms of Settlement which is exhibit
A in the present
proceedings.  
<P>

34	[Submissions as to costs]
<P>

35	I have heard submissions concerning the costs of these two sets of
proceedings.  
<P>

36	There has already been an order made on 15 December 1998 that the defendant
personally pay the costs of the five plaintiffs of
that day and that those
costs not be paid from the estate of the deceased.  The plaintiffs, concerning
the general costs of the proceedings,
are content that they should bear their
own costs because they are the only beneficiaries in the estate and, from a
practical point
of view, if they receive an order such as is usually made in
favour of successful plaintiffs that their costs be paid out of the
estate,
those costs will be paid out og moneys which they will receive in any event.

<P>

37	However, each of the plaintiffs seeks a specific order in respect to the
costs of last Tuesday 9 March and of the hearing this
day, 11 March.  The
plaintiffs seek an order that the defendant should personally pay the costs of
the plaintiffs of those days and
that the defendant should not be entitled to
recoup those costs from the estate of the deceased.  
<P>

38	Costs orders in favour of a successful party are intended, as far as
possible, to place that party in a position where he or
she is not out of
pocket from having participated in the proceedings.  Costs orders are not made
to punish an unsuccessful party.
 Normally in claims under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> </i>the executor is entitled, whatever be the outcome, to have
his costs of the proceedings paid out of the estate, since the executor
is
regarded as having an obligation to uphold the terms of the will.  
<P>

39	In the instant case I propose to make an order that the defendant executor,
subject to two exceptions, receive his costs of the
proceedings out of the
estate and that those costs be on the indemnity basis.  The two exceptions are,
firstly, the order that has
already been made on 15 December 1998 that he
personally pay the costs of the appearance on that day.  The other exception
relates
to the application which has been made on behalf of the plaintiffs that
the defendant personally should pay the costs of 9 March
and of the hearing
this day 11 March.  
<P>

40	The plaintiffs have been put to very considerable expense in having the
matter brought before the Court for a full and final
hearing of the
proceedings.  That expense has been occasioned to them, in my view,
unnecessarily.  It has been occasioned as a result
of what I have already
referred to in my reasons for judgment on the substantive claim of the
plaintiffs as being a conclusion which
it is very difficult to resist --- that
is, that the defendant executor has chosen to be deliberately obstructive in
this matter.
 It is unnecessary for me in delivering these brief reasons
concerning costs to rehearse what I have already said concerning the
responsibilities of the defendant in these proceedings and the query that I
have raised, both during the submissions from Counsel
for the defendant and in
my reasons for judgment, as to the identity of those in whose interests it has
been that the defendant sees
himself as acting.  He has chosen not to act in
the interests of the only persons who are affected by the will or the partial
intestacy
of the deceased or by the present proceedings.  
<P>

41	The defendant has also chosen to have various legal representatives from
time to time acting for him throughout these proceedings.
 The procedural
history clearly indicates considerable delay on the part of the defendant and
lack of concern by him for advancing
the orderly progress of the hearing of
these claims.  
<P>

42	In those circumstances I consider that there is substantial merit in the
application which has been made on behalf of the plaintiffs
that they should
not be out of pocket for the appearance on 9 March or for the hearing this day
(which has now occupied in excess
of two hours).  It would have been a very
simple matter for the defendant to have consented, as apparently the plaintiffs
thought
that he had consented at various earlier stages, to the substantive
orders that are set forth in the document Terms of Settlement,
which is exhibit
A herein.  
<P>

43	Accordingly, I propose to make an order that in respect of the appearance on
9 March 1999 and of the hearing today, 11 March
1999, the defendant personally
pay the costs of the plaintiffs and that he not reimburse himself from the
estate of the deceased
in respect of those costs, and, further, that he not
have his own costs out of the estate in respect of those dates.
<P>

44	In proceedings 3001 of 1997 I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the claim of the plaintiff Edna Florence 	Wintour be
dismissed.
<P>

	2.	I order that the time for the making of the claim by 	the plaintiff Arnold
Charles Wintour be extended up 	to and including
2 February 1999.
<P>

	3	I make an order as in paragraph 1 in the document 	entitled Terms of
Settlement, being exhibit A herein.
<P>

	4.	Subject to the costs order made on 15 December 	1998 and subject to Order 5
hereof, I order that the 	costs of the defendant
on the indemnity basis be paid
out of the estate of the late Neville Henry Wintour 	("the deceased"), and that
there be no order
as to the 	costs of the plaintiffs, to the intent that they
shall 	bear their own costs of the proceedings. 
<P>

	5.	I order that the defendant personally pay the costs of 	the plaintiffs of 9
March 1999 and of the hearing this 	day, 11 March
1999, and that the defendant
not 	reimburse himself from the estate of the deceased in 	respect of those
costs, and that there be
no order in 	respect of the costs of the defendant of
those dates, 	to the intent that he will personally bear his own 	costs thereof
and not reimburse himself from the 	estate of the deceased in respect of those
costs. 
<P>

45	In proceedings 4322 of 1997 I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the time for the making of this 	application be extended up to
and including 8 	October 1997.
<P>

	2.	I make an order as in paragraph 1 in the document 	entitled Terms of
Settlement, being exhibit A herein.
<P>

	3.	Subject to the costs order made on 15 December 	1998 and subject to Order 4
hereof, I order that the 	costs of the defendant
on the indemnity basis be paid
out of the estate of the late Neville Henry Wintour 	("the deceased"), and that
there be no order
as to 	costs of the plaintiffs, to the intent that they shall
bear their own costs of the proceedings. 
<P>

4. 	I order that the defendant personally pay the costs of 	the plaintiffs of 9
March 1999 and of the hearing this day, 11 March
1999, and that the defendant
not reimburse himself from the estate of the deceased in respect of those
costs, and that there be no
order in respect of the costs of the defendant of
those dates, to the intent that he will personally bear his own costs thereof
and
not reimburse himself from the estate of the deceased in respect of those
costs.
