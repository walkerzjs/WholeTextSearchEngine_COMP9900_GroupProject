Ltd</u></b>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	At the outset of this judgment I should record that I informed counsel for
the parties of my association, as employed solicitor
and as counsel, with the
original Aboriginal Legal Service throughout the 1970s and of the fact that, in
more recent years, I was
briefed as counsel on at least one occasion by a
solicitor employed by the defendant. (That solicitor is not the person said to
have
furnished the advice giving rise to these proceedings, with whom I have
had no contact.)  I was informed that neither party objected
to my hearing the
matter, at least for the limited purpose for which it was listed before me. 
<P>

2	On 12 January 1981 the plaintiff suffered spinal injuries when he dived into
the Macquarie River near Wellington, striking his
head on submerged rocks.  As
a result he is a quadriplegic.  He alleges that his injuries were the result of
the negligence of a
number of statutory authorities for reasons which, for
present purposes, I need not examine.  He further alleges that in early 1985
he
consulted a solicitor employed by the defendant, who advised him that he had no
basis for an action for damages for negligence
against anyone. 
<P>

3	In December 1994 the plaintiff sought advice from other solicitors, who
considered that he may have a cause of action.  In November
1995  they lodged
an application on his behalf to extend the limitation period for that purpose.
On 8 December 1995 Master Greenwood
granted the application, so as to enable
proceedings to be commenced against the statutory authorities to which I have
referred.
 However, those authorities appealed against the Master's decision
and that appeal was allowed by Ireland J on 21 February 1997.
<P>

4	As a result, the plaintiff has instituted the present proceedings for damages
against the defendant, alleging that the original
advice that he had no claim
arising out of the accident was negligent.  The grounds of defence assert that
this claim also is statute
barred.  As I have said, the accident occurred on 12
January 1981 and, as the law then stood, the limitation period for any action
arising from it expired on 12 January 1987.  It is the defendant's case that
any cause of action against it for negligent advice
accrued on the following
day, 13 January 1987, so that that action itself became statute barred on 13
January 1993.  The current
proceedings were not commenced until July 1997.  
<P>

5	The only question I am asked to decide is whether this defence under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</i> 1969</a> is made out. For this purpose I shall assume that
the plaintiff had a good cause of action against one or more of the statutory
authorities
arising from the accident and that he was negligently advised by a
solicitor employed by the defendant, although the defendant concedes
neither of
those things.  
<P>

6	The limitation period for bringing an action against the defendant was six
years after the cause of action first accrued: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14(1)(b)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></i>.  The critical question is when that course of action accrued.  It is
not possible to extend the six year period.  The only provision
for extension
of a limitation period is in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a>, Division 3, which relates only to actions
for damages for personal injury.  It was those provisions which were relied
upon in the
application before Master Greenwood and the appeal to Ireland J
relating to the original cause of action.  The present action is
for economic
loss arising from the loss of an opportunity to pursue a claim for personal
injury: <i>Nikolaou v Papasavas, Phillips &amp; Co</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20166%20CLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 166 CLR 394</a> at
402-3.
<P>

7	A cause of action in negligence accrues when damage first occurs:  <i>Hawkins
v Clayton</i> (1988) 164 CLR 539 per Brennan J (as he then was) at 561, Deane J
at 587 and Gaudron J at 599 ff.  As Gaudron J observed (at 601),
to determine
when damage first occurs in actions for economic loss it is necessary to
identify precisely the interest said to have
been infringed. Her Honour's
approach was adopted by other members of the Court in <i>Wardley Australia Ltd
v The State of Western Australia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a>, in the joint judgment
at 527 and per Toohey J at 555-6.  The Court has rejected any "general
overriding qualification" to the effect
that a limitation period does not begin
to run "until the stage is reached when the plaintiff discovers, or could on
reasonable inquiry
have discovered, that the loss has been sustained":
<i>Wardley </i>per Deane J at 540.
<P>

8	<i>Nikolaou</i> and the case which the High Court heard immediately before
it, <i>Johnson v Perez</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%2d89%29%20166%20CLR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988-89) 166 CLR 351</a>, were concerned primarily with
how damages in actions for professional negligence of this kind should be
assessed.  It is clear from
the judgments in both cases that their Honours
considered the plaintiff's loss to have occurred when he was deprived of his
opportunity
to pursue his claim for damages in the original action.  In
<i>Johnson v Perez</i> that opportunity was lost when the action was dismissed
for want of prosecution. In <i>Nikolaou</i>, as in this case, it was when the
action became statute-barred.  In the latter case, in the joint judgment at
404, their Honours
said:
<P>

	For reasons which are set out in some detail in <i>Johnson v Perez</i>, his
Honour should have first focussed on Mr Nikolaou's situation when his claim for
damages for personal injuries became statute-barred.
 He should have assessed
damages by reference to the loss at that date of the right to claim damages.
<P>

9	The same view had earlier been taken in <i>Doundoulakis v Antony Sdrinis
&amp; Co</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1989/68.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] VicRp 68</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20VR%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] VR 781</a>, in which it was held that a cause of action against
a solicitor for negligently failing to institute proceedings within a
limitation
period is complete when that period expires.  Ormiston  J, who gave
the leading judgment, referred to the familiar distinction between
barring the
remedy and barring the right, the right to sue being lost only if the
limitation period is pleaded in defence.  His Honour
said (at 785): 
<P>

	It is the barring of the remedy which is critical in a case such as the
present, corresponding as it does to the immunity which
the defendant then
acquires, albeit it is an immunity he may not choose to assert.  Howsoever one
characterises this conditional
immunity and this conditional barring of the
plaintiff's remedy, the plaintiff is left with a remedy very different in
quality from
that which he had before the limitation period expired.
<P>

10	In that case, the appellant had wished to bring proceedings for personal
injury against his employer but claimed that his solicitors
had failed to
commence the proceedings within time.  Ormiston J found that he had "suffered
measurable damage the moment the limitation
period had expired, in that his
remedy had been substantially impaired".  His Honour continued (at 786):
<P>

	The appellant's argument confused two matters, one, the loss of the right of
action against the employer and, two, the harm suffered
by the plaintiff when
the limitation period for that cause of action was allowed to expire. There is
no dispute that the right of
action was not completely extinguished until
either the defence was delivered or judgment in reliance upon that defence was
entered
for the defendant employer.  Nevertheless, damage in the relevant sense
does not necessarily require loss of a right, only that the
right and the
related remedy should have been impaired to some measurable or significant
degree.
<P>

11	His Honour concluded (at 787) that the appellant's remedy in the original
action was lost "when his unfettered right to sue his
employer became
statute-barred, subject only to the employer choosing not to rely upon its
rights".  It was then the damage was suffered
and the cause of action against
the solicitors was complete. 
<P>

12	For present purposes it is unnecessary to consider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s63(1)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i>, the effect of which is that a cause of action in tort is
extinguished upon the expiration of the relevant limitation period.  In
particular, it is unnecessary to enter into the debate whether the plaintiff's
original cause of action was extinguished upon expiration
of the limitation
period, subject to the possibility of revival in the event of a successful
application for extension under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a>, Division 3, or whether it was
extinguished only when an extension was refused by the judgment of Ireland J
referred to earlier:
<i>Commonwealth v Dixon</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 601</a> per Hope
JA at 609-10; <i>Commonwealth v</i> <i>Mewett</i> (1997) 191 CLR 471 per Dawson
J at 507-10, Toohey J at 515-7 and McHugh J at 522-3.  
<P>

13	Provision in the Act for an application for extension does not alter the
fact that, when the limitation period expired, the plaintiff's
remedy was
"impaired to some measurable or significant degree": <i>Doundoulakis</i>
(supra).  In <i>Mewett</i>, Dawson J was of the view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14(1)</a> of the Act
bars the remedy but does not extinguish "the underlying cause of action" (at
509).  He considered that extinguishment
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s63(1)</a> occurred only when an
application for extension of time had been refused or the opportunity to make
it had passed.  Albeit in a different
context, some of his Honour's
observations (also at 509) are relevant for present purposes: 
<P>

	Thus <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14(1)</a> does not of itself prevent a statute-barred cause of action from
continuing in existence.  Of course, the value of the property comprising
the
cause of action would be affected by the fact that the action was
statute-barred and would further be affected by such factors
as the likelihood
of the limitation defence being pleaded or the likelihood of the limitation
period being extended.
<P>

14	Accordingly, the plaintiff's cause of action against the defendant first
accrued when his original action became statute-barred.
 It was then that the
limitation period in which to bring the present action began to run, pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(1).</a> 
<P>

15	Counsel for the plaintiff referred to a passage in the judgment of Deane J
in <i>Hawkins v Clayton</i> (at 590), in which his Honour considered that "the
reference in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14(1)</a> of the Act to the cause of action first accruing should be
construed as excluding any period during which the wrongful act itself
effectively precluded the institution of the proceedings".  In that context,
his Honour referred to the equitable notion that it
would be unconscionable to
permit reliance upon a limitation provision where a cause of action had been
concealed until after the
relevant period had expired: see now <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the Act.
It would be unconscionable for the defendant to rely upon the limitation period
in the present case, it was said, because
the plaintiff's predicament is
entirely the result of the negligent advice he was given by the defendant's
employed solicitor in
1985. 
<P>

16	In <i>Hawkins v Clayton </i>the behaviour of the solicitors was such that
the appellant was unaware for some years of the facts upon which an action
against them
might have been brought.  That is not this case.  At any time
after receiving the solicitor's advice in 1985, the plaintiff could
have sought
another legal opinion, as he finally did in December 1994.  The distinction
between <i>Hawkins v Clayton </i>and a case such as the present was drawn in
<i>Sampson v Zucker </i>(Court of Appeal, unreported 11 December 1996) per
Gleeson CJ at p4ff.  In any event, as the Chief Justice observed, the view of
Deane
J in <i>Hawkins v Clayton </i>was not applied by the other justices of
the High Court in that case.
<P>

17	The decision of Master Harrison in <i>Grew v Walsh </i>(unreported, 16
October 1997), upon which counsel for the plaintiff also relied, takes the
matter no further.  That was an application
by the defendant solicitor that the
plaintiff's action be summarily dismissed or struck out because it was
statute-barred.  The Master
refused the application only because the plaintiff,
in a reply to the defence, alleged that the defendant had fraudulently
concealed
the plaintiff's entitlement to bring an action against him for a
significant period of time <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s55).</a>  The Master concluded that he had an arguable
case that there was a period of concealment.  No such allegation has been made
in the
present case.
<P>

18	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defence based upon the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a> </i>is made out.  I shall consult counsel about the orders which should be
made and, if necessary, hear argument on costs.
