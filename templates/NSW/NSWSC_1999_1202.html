WEDNESDAY 24 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>4526/98  KEITH WILLIAM SCHUBERT v DAISY ISABELLA JOHNSEN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in
respect of the estate of the late Leonard William Schubert who died on 17 June
1997.
<P>

2  	The deceased was survived by the plaintiff, who is his son by his
first marriage, and the defendant his defacto wife of many
years standing.  The
plaintiff's son Michael was also a party as a plaintiff, however about six
months ago or earlier this year he
discontinued the proceedings.
<P>

3  	The estate consists of realty and other property having a net
value of $1,000,407.44.  There have been costs incurred in this
matter which
are fairly substantial.  The plaintiff's costs are in the order of $32,572 and
the defendant's costs of the proceedings
are in the order of $32,290.  The
costs of administration amount to $35,540, a total of $100,402.
<P>

4  	The deceased made his last Will on 3 July 1995.  He gave various
pecuniary legacies amounting to some $251,000 to various friends,
family
members and other people who had been close to him.  One of the persons to
receive a legacy was the plaintiff who received
the legacy of $1,000.
<P>

5  	In his Will the deceased in giving that gift said that he made it
to his son Keith Schubert who he had not seen for the past
fifty years and whom
he was informed was a retired accountant and comfortably settled.  Apart from
the gift of a small item of real
estate the majority of the residue of the
estate passed to the defendant.
<P>

6  	It is necessary to give a little of the chronology in the matter.
The defendant Mrs Johnsen was born on 28 September 1919. 
The deceased first
marriage was on 5 February 1927 to Winifred Manning Schubert.  They gave birth
to a child, the plaintiff Keith
William Schubert on 11 July 1927.
<P>

7  	In 1938 the defendant, who at this stage of course had no contact
with the deceased, married and they had a child Raymond. 
By 1938 the
relationship between the deceased and the plaintiff's mother had started to
deteriorate.  From then until 1942 clearly
it was a very unhappy household with
continual arguments between the parents.  The plaintiff himself in 1941 after
taking the intermediate
certificate, left school and got a job to help his
mother to meet the living expenses.  Clearly the deceased was not anxious to
support
her and wanted to be away from her.
<P>

8  	In August 1942 the plaintiff's mother was ejected by the deceased
from the home and thereafter for the next year or so were
in a somewhat
destitute situation living in a stable in College Street, Sydney while they
waited for maintenance.
<P>

9  	The plaintiff had to support his mother during this time, a
matter which no doubt has permanently imprinted itself on his mind
and in his
memories of family life in such times..
<P>

10  	In late 1942 the defendant met the deceased she having been
separated from her husband about a year.  It was in early 1945
that the
defendant and the deceased started living together in a defacto relationship
which continued until the deceased's death.
 Meanwhile the plaintiff had
post-war qualified as an accountant and he lived with his mother at Enmore.
The deceased and the defendant
were working in a fairly Spartan situation in
Sydney, for instance making clothes pegs for sale.  Eventually they decided to
move
to Taree and set up business in a timber mill.  That business became
successful and ultimately extended into other areas such as
caravan parks in
which the defendant worked for many years.
<P>

11  	In 1950 the defendant divorced her husband who she had been
separated from for many years.  The plaintiff meanwhile in 1953
had married and
their son Michael was born on 8 December 1957.  Notwithstanding the terrible
time that the plaintiff had with his
father leaving his mother, the plaintiff
after the birth of his son rang the deceased and told him the fact that he now
had a grandson.
 He then sent photographs to the deceased.
<P>

12  	In the 1950s and the early 1960s the defendant and the deceased
expanded their interests in the Taree area including opening
a caravan park and
other activities.
<P>

13  	In 1961 the plaintiff and son Michael travelled to Taree in
order to see the deceased.  They did not do so as he was not there
but they did
see the defendant.  After that time a Christmas card was sent by the plaintiff
and his wife to the deceased and for
some years up until 1969 there was a
response from the deceased returning Christmas cards to them.
<P>

14  	It was in 1969 that the plaintiff again tried to meet his
father.  In fact he saw the deceased's brother Donald on a visit
to Taree and
was told by him it would be very awkward at that time if he saw his father.
Why that is so was not explored in the evidence,
although it is apparent that
the deceased and the plaintiff's mother were divorced in 1971 and those matters
may have been under
consideration at the time he saw the brother Donald.
<P>

15  	In 1990 there was another occasion when the plaintiff came to
Taree and this time he did meet the deceased and there is some
evidence of
photographs of the two of them together.  
<P>

16  	The plaintiff's mother died on 12 July 1990 and the plaintiff
conveyed that information to the deceased.  After this time there
were, still
in the early 1990s, Christmas cards sent by the plaintiff to his father the
deceased and he would write a note in them.
 I am satisfied that the evidence
does disclose the sending of these cards and that on this occasion the deceased
did not respond
to them.
<P>

17  	The defendant does not acknowledge, remember or know of the
sending of those cards but clearly the records kept by the plaintiff
and his
wife shows that this contact was continued.  By 1994 the plaintiff's son
Michael had qualified and obtained a Master's degree
in Social Science and on
this occasion the plaintiff sent a photograph of his son in his wig and gown to
the deceased.  There was
no response and it is to be noted that the deceased
never ever met Michael, his grandson.
<P>

18  	In July 1995 the Will in question was executed, it was also in
this year that Michael started his own life.  He entered into
a defacto
relationship with Virginia Close, she had two children at this stage, one was
Olivia who was born on 27 June 1992 and the
other was Sebastien who was born on
15 November 1989.  Thereafter Michael and Virginia had further children
themselves, Isabeau in
May 1997 and Paris in April 1999.  It was on 17 June
1997 that the deceased died.
<P>

19  	In due course the proceedings were commenced and a substantial
part of the real estate and other assets were distributed to
the defendant.  In
addition she paid out the legacies of $251,000 that I have referred to.
<P>

20  	In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High Court
has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two
stage approach that a Court must take.  At page 209 it said the following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the course may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

21  	As indicated by the High Court it is necessary obviously to
consider the plaintiff's situation.
<P>

22  	The plaintiff is married, is 72 years of age and has one son
Michael.  The plaintiff has been married since 1953.  Given the
length of the
marriage and one which appears to have been happy it is appropriate to take
into account the assets of both the plaintiff
and his wife.  I will firstly
deal however with the plaintiff's assets.
<P>

23  	At the moment he has shares worth $428,665, bank accounts of
$129,709, he has half the proceeds of sale of his St Ives home
of $206,500,
furniture and effects of about $50,000, a half interest along with his wife in
the piece of land at Lennox Head where
they wish to settle, a half interest
being valued at $70,000 and cars having a total value of $19,000.  This totals
$903,874.
<P>

24  	His wife for her part has shares of some $291,050, bank accounts
of $136,074, half interest in land of $70,000, furniture and
effects of
$50,000, half the sale proceeds of St Ives of $206,500.  This totals $753,624.
They between them have assets worth $1,657,494.
<P>

25  	Their income situation is modest, however it is sufficient for
their circumstances.  They have or expect to receive between
them somewhere in
the order of $55,900 for the year ended 30 June 1999.  If one allowed some
$12,000 for tax that provides a fortnightly
income of about $1650.  Their
outgoings which have been reduced because they have sold their St Ives property
are presently $1350
per fortnight plus some rent while they decide whether to
build on their land at Lennox Head.
<P>

26  	As far as the plaintiff's health is concerned he does have
problems with arthritis but most of those have been fortunately
overcome by the
fact that he has decided to move to Lennox Head no doubt to be closer to his
son who lives at Byron Bay.
<P>

27  	It is necessary for the court to consider the relationship
between the plaintiff and the deceased.  Clearly there was a very
acrimonious
break up between the deceased and his first wife.  The plaintiff was left
abandoned by his father having to try and work
to save sufficient money to
support his mother.  
<P>

28  	To the plaintiff's great credit he continued to make attempts to
contact the deceased as he matured and made his way in life.
 It seems to me
that a consideration of these contacts tends to show that the plaintiff was
rebuffed by the deceased and I suspect
that the deceased did not want to have
anything to do with the plaintiff or anything associated with his first
marriage.
<P>

29  	So far as I am concerned I am not critical in any sense of the
plaintiff and such lack of contact that might be referred to
I think would not
in any way impact upon the order that should be made in his favour.  If
anything the fact that he did persist in
making contact indicates a concern
that he had for his father.
<P>

30  	It is also necessary to have regard to any others having a claim
upon the bounty of the testator.  In this regard there are
a number of legatees
who received legacies totalling $250,000 to which I have referred.
<P>

31  	The defendant has given evidence which identifies the persons
and the role they played in the life of the deceased.  No doubt
the deceased
seems to have carefully considered those who had assisted him and been part of
his life for the many years that he was
in the Taree area.  There is no
evidence of the means of those persons.
<P>

32  	The most important person to consider of course in this category
is the defendant.  She is 80 years of age, is single and has
no dependants.
She appears in reasonable health although certainly she is frail.  Her
financial situation is quite reasonable, she
has assets of her own of some
$591,527 and she has received from the estate $592,522.  Those assets are
currently made up of the
following:  Real estate in various parcels which
include the home $495,000, loans $145,007, shares $95,035, cash $331,878, plant
and cattle $123,658, motor vehicle $27,000 totalling $1,217,570.  She has
liabilities of $33,532 leaving her net worth of $1,184,038.
 Clearly she is in
comfortable circumstances and adequately provided for.
<P>

33  	So far as the relations with the deceased are concerned it is to
be noted that she and the deceased had 52 years together.
 That apparently was
a happy relationship but it also had its elements of hard work for the
defendant.  She assisted the deceased
assiduously during their relationship and
helped him build up the assets which now form part of the estate.  She worked
long hours
and for no reward in this regard.
<P>

34  	It is necessary to see how the plaintiff may have been left
without adequate and proper provision for his maintenance, education
and
advancement in life because that is the question which the court has to
consider under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> of the Act.
<P>

35  	The plaintiff says that he had been left with inadequate
provision to the extent that: (1) he has depleted his assets to assist
his son
Michael; and (2) is likely to expend further funds in the future in assisting
his son.  He does not advance any other need
which is particular to himself.
<P>

36  	In these circumstances it is necessary to look at Michael's
position.  Michael is a person who obviously has some qualifications,
I have
referred to him having a Master of Social Sciences.  The evidence discloses
that he has recently been a University lecturer
earning in excess of $50,000
per annum.  He is in a defacto relationship and is in a position along with his
partner of caring for
four young children.
<P>

37  	His financial situation and that of his partner are, that they
have two blocks of land, one at Lennox Head which is worth $135,000
and one at
Byron Bay costing $115,000.  $40,000 has been spent moving an old house there
and about $60,000 is in the process of being
spent mainly from funds from his
father in renovating that property.  That puts a total value of some $350,000.
They have a mortgage
of $240,000.  This leaves a balance between them of
$110,000.
<P>

38  	They have small superannuation benefits which they cannot access
at this stage and there is minor amounts of $3,000 in personal
effects and a
car.  Clearly they are not in a good situation but they are in a situation
which is not uncommon to many young couples.
<P>

39  	They do have difficulty in that the daughter Olivia suffers from
a range of medical disabilities and is in effect profoundly
disabled.  She has
a hole in the heart and a number of birth defects which means that she requires
full-time care.  Those difficulties
were obviously evident when Michael and his
defacto partner commenced their relationship.
<P>

40  	As a result he receives a carer's pension of $307.69 per
fortnight and family assistance of $308.29 per fortnight.  His partner
Virginia
receives in effect $358 per fortnight by way of maintenance for her children
and a parenting allowance of $293.  She also
receives a special disability
allowance of $75.60 per fortnight.  They have expenses which are not unusual
given their assets and
they clearly have been supported by the plaintiff.
<P>

41  	The assistance which the plaintiff has given to his son Michael
to date between December 1985 and November 1999 amounts to
a sum of
$162,076.74.  Some comes from the plaintiff's wife but the majority from the
plaintiff.  There are continual payments for
Mastercard and Visa accounts and
payments for the mortgage which have been met as Michael has been unable to
meet them.
<P>

42  	Apart from this the plaintiff says that he wishes in the future
to give further assistance to his son Michael and his family.
 In his recent
affidavit he lists this as completion of urgent renovations $7,370, replacement
car to hold six people and wheelchair
$40,000, day to day living expenses
$23,000 and legal expenses for child maintenance $5,000 totalling $75,370.
<P>

43  	The scheme of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> is one which provides
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> for orders to be made in favour of eligible persons.  These persons
are defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6.</a>  Michael clearly is not an eligible person and he cannot
have an order made in his favour.  This much he recognised when he discontinued
the proceedings earlier this year.
<P>

44  	The plaintiff suggests that as there is a good moral need for
him to help his son he thus meets the criteria in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> and  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> of the Act.  I
have no doubt it is morally appropriate for the plaintiff to help his son.  To
the extent that he does so and disadvantages
himself he is to be commended.
<P>

45  	It is quite a different situation where there is a legal
obligation of a parent to provide for a child.  An example which readily
springs to mind is a child under 18 in the care and custody of a claimant.
That is not the situation in the present case.
<P>

46  	Michael is 42 years of age and well qualified.  He has chosen
his present course in life including pursuing parenting responsibilities
for
Olivia.  There is no legal obligation upon the plaintiff to assist Michael in
these circumstances, there is only a moral obligation.
<P>

47  	In <b>Crawshaw v Perpetual Trustees Co. Ltd</b> Young J, 27
April 1988 his Honour had to consider a slightly different problem but at least
it throws some light on the present claim.
 His Honour at page 7 of the
judgment says as follows:
<P>

"This raises a problem that I do not think has been covered by the cases,
namely, what happens to a plaintiff who in advance of
a decision in an
application under the Act but after the date of the testatrix's death incurs
substantial liabilities.  Part of these
liabilities have been because he has
been generous to his step daughter in giving her $15,000.  It is clear from
other decisions
under this Act that the plaintiff who makes such gifts cannot,
because he or she is impoverished thereby, claim that that impoverishment
is
something that should be reimbursed because of some moral duty that the
testatrix owed."
<P>

48  	In the present case there is of course no suggestion of
unwarranted gifts to Michael.  In the context of moral duty as his
Honour there
refers to it (even though this expression is not approved at the moment) the
Act does specify to whom a duty is owed.
 In this case it is not Michael.  
<P>

49  	To allow the plaintiff's claim is simply to accede to a claim
which the Act does not recognise.  Accordingly, in my view the
plaintiff has
not been left without adequate and proper provision for his maintenance,
education and advancement in life.
<P>

50  	Accordingly, I dismiss the summons.  I order that the
defendant's costs on an indemnity basis be paid out of the estate or
retained
out of the estate.
<P>

51  	I will hear further submissions on costs.
<P>

52  	I will allow Ex.E being photographs of Olivia to be returned.
<P>
