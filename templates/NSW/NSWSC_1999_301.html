THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONCOMMERCIAL LISTROLFE
JWEDNESDAY,  7 APRIL 1999<b>50009/1999 - BELL COAL PTY LIMITED v UB MINERALS
INC (IN LIQUIDATION) &amp; ANORJUDGMENT</b>HIS HONOUR:<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	By a Summons issued on 28 January 1999 the plaintiff, Bell Coal Pty Limited,
"Bell Coal", for which Mr T.F. Bathurst of Queen's
Counsel and Mr T.G.R. Parker
of Counsel appeared, sued the first defendant, UB Minerals Inc (In
Liquidation), ("UBN"), and Mr R.A.F.
England, who was appointed as its
liquidator on 29 February 1996.  Mr R.J. Whitington of Queen's Counsel appeared
on behalf of the
defendants.  I shall refer to these proceedings as "the New
South Wales proceedings".
<P>

2	By that Summons Bell Coal sought declarations that the purported avoidance by
Mr England, on his own behalf and on behalf of UBN,
of a certain guarantee is
invalid and of no effect; that Bell Coal is not indebted to UBN in the sum of
US$1,554,590 as claimed by
Mr England; and that an agreement referred to as the
Set-Off Agreement is not, and never has been, of any legal effect or,
alternatively,
has, in the circumstances which have happened, been avoided by
Bell Coal.  Bell Coal also sought judgment against UBN in the sum
of
US$4,866,725.48 together with interest; a declaration that as from 3 December
1992 UBN holds the proceeds of the US Tax Refund
on trust for it; and orders
that there be an inquiry into what moneys and other assets have, since 3
December 1992, been held by
UBN and/or Mr England representing the proceeds of
that Refund.  To the extent that such moneys or other assets are still held by
them an order is sought that they be transferred to Bell Coal, and, to the
extent that such moneys and other assets are not now held
by them, that they
pay to Bell Coal equitable compensation together with interest pursuant to
equitable principles or alternatively
s.94 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b>.
<P>

3	In the portion of the Summons dealing with the nature of the dispute it is
pleaded that it arises out of an agreement entered
into on 20 September 1989
between Bell Coal and a company in the Bond Group, BBH Bond Brewing BV,
("BBH"), whereby Bell Coal sold
to BBH one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, a
company incorporated in Louisiana and called UB Minerals Inc, ("UBL").  It is
pleaded
that UBN, which was also known as UB Minerals Inc but which had been
incorporated in Nevada, is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBL
and by an agreement
dated 25 September 1989 guaranteed the obligations of BBH under the sale
agreement.
<P>

4	It is pleaded that the sale price was to be adjusted for any tax refunds.
Subsequently there was a tax refund of US$4.87m from
the US Inland Revenue
authorities and a tax assessment of A$1.98m from the Australian Tax authorities
and, in 1992, the Set-Off Agreement
was entered into between Bell Coal and
UBN's administration in consequence of which the plaintiff was paid US$1.55m
from the US Tax
Refund and UBN retained the balance and agreed to meet the
Australian Tax assessment.  It is asserted that UBN had not at the time
of the
Set-Off Agreement, and has not subsequently, been adjudged liable to pay the
Australian assessment, and is now engaged in
litigation with the Australian
Taxation Office "in which it seeks to escape liability for the assessment".
<P>

5	On 2 December 1998 the solicitors for Mr England wrote to Bell Coal stating
that they acted for the liquidator of UBN and:-
<P>

	<b>"The Liquidator hereby avoids:-</b>
<P>

<b>1.	The agreement made on 3 December 1992 between Australian Consolidated
Investments Limited and/or Bell Coal Pty Limited and the
Scheme Administrators
of Bond Corporation Holdings Limited whereby Australian Consolidated
Investments Limited and/or Bell Coal Pty
Limited received the sum of
US$1,554,590 from UBN.</b>
<P>

<b>2.	The agreement dated 25 September 1989 between UBN and Bell Coal Pty
Limited whereby UBN guaranteed to Bell Coal Pty Limited the
payment of all
obligations of BBH Bond Brewing BV (`BBHBV') to Bell Coal Pty Limited pursuant
to a share sale agreement dated 20
September 1989 between Bell Coal Pty Limited
and BBHBV and granted a security interest in all of its assets in favour of
Bell Coal
Pty Limited.</b>
<P>

<b>This notice is served pursuant to Section 130(2) of the Companies Code
and/or Section 206(2) of the Corporations Law, Section 451
of the Companies
Code and/or Section 565 of the Corporations Law and Section 205 of the
Companies Code and/or Section 226 of the
Corporations Law."</b>
<P>

Those sections deal with the wrongful furnishing of financial assistance for
the purchase of shares in a company, preferences and
charges.
<P>

6	Unbeknown to Bell Coal, UBN and Mr England commenced proceedings, as
plaintiffs, in the Supreme Court of South Australia against
Australian
Consolidated Investments Limited, ("ACIL"), which, prior to 12 December 1990,
was named Bell Resources Limited, and Bell
Coal by a Writ and Statement of
Claim issued on 2 December 1998, ("the South Australian proceedings").  The
institution of these
proceedings was not disclosed to Bell Coal or ACIL until
about 2 February 1999 and after Bell Coal's Summons had been served.
<P>

7	By the Statement of Claim in the South Australian proceedings the plaintiffs
sought compensation by way of damages or other relief
pursuant to s.130(5) of
the <b>Companies Code</b> and/or ss.206(5) or 260D(2) and 1317HD of the
<b>Corporations Law</b>; a declaration that the Bell Coal indemnity and the
Bell Coal settlement are void or, in the alternative, voidable pursuant to
s.451
of the <b>Companies Code</b> and/or s.565 of the <b>Corporations Law</b>,
s.205 of the <b>Companies Code</b> and/or s.266 of the <b>Corporations Law
</b>or otherwise; a declaration that ACIL and/or Bell Coal are liable as
constructive trustees to account to the first plaintiff for the
loss suffered
by the first plaintiff and compound interest thereon; a declaration that the
first plaintiff has or is entitled to
a proprietary interest in the assets of
ACIL and/or Bell Coal to the extent of the value of the first plaintiff's loss
and compound
interest thereon; a declaration that ACIL and/or Bell Coal are
liable to compensate the first plaintiff by way of equitable damages
for the
amount of the loss suffered by the first plaintiff and compound interest
thereon; damages; restitution; equitable compensation
or an account of profit;
damages for loss of use of money; interest including compound interest; and
costs.
<P>

8	It was not in issue that both sets of proceedings arose out of the same
factual matrix, gave rise to substantially the same issues,
and, conveniently,
should be heard together with the evidence in one being treated as evidence in
the other.
<P>

9	It was not in issue that the Summons issued in the New South Wales
proceedings was served on the defendants on 29 January 1999,
it being
responsive to the purported avoidance by the liquidator.  Nor was it in issue
that at that time Bell Coal was not aware
that the South Australian proceedings
had been instituted.  The Summons in the New South Wales proceedings was issued
without leave
having been granted pursuant to s.471B of the <b>Corporations
Law</b> and, when it was served on 28 January 1999, the solicitors for Bell
Coal asked Mr England to advise whether he would consent to such
leave being
granted.  His solicitors replied on 11 February 1999 stating, in relation to
this matter:-
<P>

	<b>"We are instructed that our client does not consent to leave being granted
to your client to proceed against UBN, a company in liquidation.</b>
<P>

<b>	We trust you have been provided with a copy of the Summons and Statement of
Claim served on your clients Bell Coal and Australian
Consolidated Investments
Limited in the Supreme Court of South Australia action number 1609 of
1998.</b>
<P>

<b>	We consider that the matter raised by your client's claim would be more
appropriately pursued (to the extent they are capable of
being pursued) by way
of proof of debt in the winding up of UBN or by defence and counter-claim in
Supreme Court action number 1609
of 1998, given the similarity and the subject
matter of the two proceedings.  For these reasons and others, we do not
consider this
to be an appropriate matter for leave to be granted.</b>
<P>

<b>	Despite the above, should your client nevertheless wish to commence the
above action against our client, an action for leave to proceed
will need to be
pursued.  This will be vigorously opposed and full recovery of costs
sought."</b>
<P>

10	On 15 February 1999 the solicitors for Bell Coal responded stating, inter
alia:-
<P>

	<b>"With respect, not to consent to leave being granted to proceed against the
company in liquidation is an untenable position when the
company in liquidation
has brought mirror image proceedings against our client."</b>
<P>

11	There was further disputatious correspondence about whether leave to proceed
should be granted and, by a Notice of Motion filed
on 24 February 1999, Bell
Coal sought an order that it be granted leave to proceed "with this action
against the first defendant".
<P>

12	It is that Notice of Motion which came before me for determination on 29
March 1999.
<P>

<b>Some Matters Apparently Not In Issue</b>
<P>

13	Mr Whitington conceded that if I was minded to grant leave to proceed I
could do so <i>nunc pro tunc</i>, and that there was no need for Bell Coal to
amend its Notice of Motion to seek an order in those precise terms.
<P>

14	He submitted that Bell Coal should also have sought leave to proceed against
Mr England as relief was sought against him in his
personal capacity, but that
if I considered that was correct and, contrary to his submissions, that leave
to proceed should be granted
as against Mr England, there was no requirement
for the Notice of Motion to be amended to seek that relief.
<P>

15	Whilst I received submissions from both parties as to the efficacy of the
pleadings, which in the South Australian proceedings
include a Defence and a
Reply, it was agreed that I was not being asked to rule on the pleadings.
There was no issue that the Summons
in the New South Wales proceedings
disclosed a prima facie case for relief.  The submission was that leave should
not be granted
as that case could be determined in the South Australian
proceedings.
<P>

16	Also a number of observations were made as to whether the Supreme Court of
South Australia or this Court is the more appropriate
and convenient forum in
which the proceedings should be heard.  However, and notwithstanding that UBN
and Mr England have filed a
Notice of Motion in the New South Wales proceedings
seeking an order that in the event of leave being granted to Bell Coal to
proceed
with this action that it be permanently stayed or, in the alternative,
be transferred to the Supreme Court of South Australia pursuant
to the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act</a></b> 1987, I was expressly asked
not to decide those points at this stage.  I was asked to confine my
consideration to the question of
leave, which I shall do.
<P>

17	A basic submission of Mr Whitington was that all the matters raised by Bell
Coal could be decided in the South Australian proceedings,
which had been
regularly instituted without the necessity for the grant of any leave, and
that, accordingly, it was inappropriate
to grant leave to proceed in the New
South Wales proceedings as that would give rise to parallel proceedings in two
Courts. It was
not seriously in issue that in all probability all the matters
in issue in the proceedings could be determined in the South Australian
proceedings, although a question arose as to the attitude of the liquidator if
Bell Coal and/or ACIL sought to bring a counter-claim
in the South Australian
proceedings for the substantive relief sought in the New South Wales
proceedings.  Mr Whitington took instructions
on this and stated that without
prejudice to his clients' position in relation to the application before me,
they would not oppose
a grant of leave if one was sought for Bell Coal to
institute a counter-claim that the 1992 Set-Off Agreement was a nullity or
otherwise
ought to be set aside, and further for an order for the payment by
his clients of the difference between the United States' refund
of tax of about
US$4.8m and the amount already received of about US$1.5m.  This did not cover
the grant of leave in relation to a
trust issue raised by Bell Coal.
<P>

18	In this context he said that the words "without prejudice" were used to
maintain the opposition to the present application, and
that Mr England had
given the instructions referred to in the last paragraph as a matter of
expediency, because the defence has "pushed
the matter so far that it is only a
short step to seek positive relief".  Mr Whitington submitted that that
concession is a factor
against, rather than in favour of, the grant of leave to
proceed in the New South Wales proceedings, on the basis that all matters
in
issue will be determined in the one set of proceedings.
<P>

19	The next matter which did not seem to be greatly in issue was that if I
granted leave to Bell Coal to proceed with the New South
Wales proceedings
there would be on foot two sets of proceedings raising essentially the same
issues, and that the sensible course
for the resolution of those proceedings
would be, if they were in the one Court, to make an order to the effect that
they be heard
together and that evidence in the one  be evidence in the other.
I say "to the effect" because it will obviously be a matter for
the Judge
administering the proceedings to determine how best they should go forward.
Inherent in what I have just said, bearing
in mind that the proceedings are in
two different Courts, was an acceptance that if I grant leave to proceed with
the New South Wales
proceedings an application will be made in those
proceedings by Mr Whitington's client to cross-vest them to the Supreme Court
of
South Australia, and an application will be made by Bell Coal and ACIL in
the South Australian proceedings to cross-vest them to
this Court.
<P>

20	It happens, from time to time, that "parallel" proceedings are instituted in
two States, thus giving rise to the need to consider
a cross-vesting
application or cross-vesting applications, and whether the Court should, of its
own motion, cross-vest proceedings.
 In my experience one Court usually holds
its hand until a determination by the other Court of such an application and,
depending
upon the decision, orders may be made by consent linking both sets of
proceedings in the one State: <b>Kevin Barrington &amp; 71 Others v Centre
Mildura Plaza Pty Limited &amp; Ors</b> (Rolfe J - 4 March 1999 -
unreported).
<P>

21	However, as I made clear in <b>Kevin Barrington</b>, the refusal to
cross-vest the proceedings from New South Wales does not compel, in my view,
the Court of another State to agree
that the proceedings in that State should
be transferred to New South Wales.  Each Court must, in the view I take, deal
with these
matters as it sees fit, although in proceedings such as the present
it appears highly desirable that they be heard in the one Court
at the same
time.  Counsel did not suggest to the contrary.
<P>

22	I wish to make it clear that if I do grant leave to proceed, I am not to be
taken as expressing, albeit impliedly, any view as
to the fate of a
cross-vesting application to this Court to transfer the New South Wales
proceedings to the Supreme Court of South
Australia, or any view that the South
Australian proceedings should be cross-vested to this Court.  Such
applications, if brought
and pursued, will be determined on their merits.  I
have expressly been requested to determine the sole point as to whether Bell
Coal should have leave to proceed.
<P>

23	None-the-less, the reality of the situation is that Bell Coal wishes to have
the proceedings heard in this Court, whilst UBN
and Mr England wish to have
them heard in the Supreme Court of South Australia.  Whilst I do not wish to be
unduly critical of the
parties, it seems, particularly in circumstances where a
major protagonist is in liquidation, unfortunate that not inconsiderable
costs
have been expended on an application for leave to proceed when, as I understand
it, the real issue is in which Court the proceedings
should go forward.
Presumably the view has been taken by Bell Coal that it must have proceedings
validly on foot in this Court as
a launching pad for any application to
cross-vest the South Australian proceedings; whereas the view has been taken by
UBN and Mr
England that if there are no proceedings validly on foot in New
South Wales the basis for an application to cross-vest the South
Australian
proceedings to this Court is limited.  It was conceded by Mr Whitington that
the absence of proceedings in this Court
would not preclude Bell Coal and ACIL
making an application to the Supreme Court of South Australia to cross-vest the
South Australian
proceedings to this Court, but, as I would understand it, the
view is taken that Bell Coal's and ACIL's grounds would be somewhat
weakened by
the absence of effective and valid New South Wales proceedings.  Therefore, to
a not inconsiderable extent, the present
application is a tactical manoeuvre in
aid of determining which Court should hear the proceedings, Mr Whitington's
clients accepting,
as the concession I have set forth makes clear, that they
cannot prevent Bell Coal from ventilating the matters it wishes to litigate,
either by way of defence or counter claim, in the South Australian
proceedings.
<P>

24	A further matter, which was not in issue, was that this is not a case in
which Bell Coal should have pursued its rights by lodging
a Proof of Debt,
rather than resorting to litigation.  Initially Mr Whitington submitted that
the short issue was that Mr England
should not be vexed with unnecessary
proceedings.  In this context he referred to authorities such as <b>Capita
Financial Group Limited v Rothwells Limited (No 2)</b> (1989) 7 ACLC 634.  His
submission, however, was not that Bell Coal should have sought to establish its
rights by lodging a Proof
of Debt, but rather that it could achieve all that it
seeks and all that is appropriate in the South Australian proceedings.  In
this
respect he relied upon the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in
<b>Vagramd Pty Limited (In Liquidation) v Fielding &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2010%20ACSR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 10 ACSR
373</a>, which  set out the basic principles pursuant to which the largely
unfettered discretion of the Court to grant leave should be exercised
and, at
p.377, their Honours said:-
<P>

	<b>"The reason for imposing a requirement of leave, in the case of litigation
against companies in liquidation, was explained a century
ago by Manning J of
the New South Wales Supreme Court, in <i>Thomson v Mulgoa Irrigation Co
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281893%29%204%20BC%20%28NSW%29%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1893) 4 BC (NSW) 33:</a></b>
<P>

<b>	`All that s.140 means is that a company in liquidation is not to be
harassed and its assets wasted by unnecessary litigation, and
the leave of the
Court is therefore required as a safeguard.  Before any action can be brought
or continued against a company, the
Court must investigate the intended
litigation.'</b>
<P>

<b>	Manning J did not suggest that it was necessary to prove all the elements
of the applicant's claim."</b>
<P>

25	Their Honours also cited from the judgment of McPherson J in
<b>Ogilvie-Grant v East</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%207%20ACLR%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 7 ACLR 669.</a>  At pp.671-2 his Honour
said:-
<P>

	<b>"The precise purpose and function of provisions similar to s.230(3) have
seldom been explained.  From time to time the suggestion
has been made that the
prohibition exists in order to effectuate the statutory policy of ensuring that
corporate assets are distributed
rateably among all creditors so that none of
them will gain an advantage over others: see e.g. <i>Re Sydney Formworks Pty
Limited ...</i>  But in Australia at least it is not often that the institution
of proceedings or even the recovery of judgment operates to confer
a priority
or advantage on a litigating creditor.  A more convincing explanation is that,
without the relevant restriction, a company
in liquidation would be subjected
to a multiplicity of actions which would be both expensive and time consuming
as well in some cases
as unnecessary.  This explanation has been accepted in a
number of Canadian cases and appears also to have been adopted by Street
J in
<i>Re A.J. Benjamin Limited</i>.</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>	The question whether a claimant should be permitted to proceed by action,
or should be required to submit his proof of debt and,
if dissatisfied, appeal
to a Judge, is therefore reduced largely to one of choosing between alternative
forms of procedure.  The
effect of s.230(3) is to require the claimant to adopt
the course of lodging a proof of debt unless he can demonstrate that there
is
some good reason why a departure from that procedure is justified in the case
of the particular claim in dispute.  This is really
all that is meant in this
context by expressions such as `convenience' and `balance of convenience' that
appear in judgments on the
matter ...   It, of course, follows that it is quite
impossible to state in an exhaustive manner all the circumstances in which
leave
to proceed may be appropriate, but in the past they have been seen to
include factors such as the amount and seriousness of the claim,
the degree of
complexity of the legal and factual issues involved, and the stage to which the
proceedings, if already commenced,
may have progressed."</b>
<P>

26	Mr Whitington's initial submission also included an assertion that there was
no need for a counter-claim as all matters could
be determined on the Defence
filed in the South Australian proceedings.  After this submission was explored
in a little more detail
with the consequence that it became clear that Bell
Coal could not seek all the substantive relief it propounded without a
counter-claim,
Mr Whitington undertook to obtain instructions from Mr England
as to his attitude to the granting of leave if it was sought in the
South
Australian proceedings in relation to a counter-claim.  I have recorded the
result of those instructions.
<P>

<b>The Present Case</b>
<P>

27	Bell Coal's proceedings were directly responsive to Mr England's purported
avoidance as set forth in the letter of 2 December
1998.  In addition to taking
that approach Mr England had obviously instructed his solicitors to institute
the South Australian proceedings
but, as I have said, the institution of those
proceedings was not disclosed to Bell Coal or its solicitors until about 2
February
1999.  There was, of course, no obligation on Mr England or his
solicitors to make any such disclosure, although in the context it
may seem, at
least prima facie, a little strange that it was not done.  However, one
consequence of their not having done so was
that Bell Coal brought the New
South Wales proceedings, in which it crafted the relief it sought on specific
bases.  As has been
said, and so much could not have been and was not in issue,
the relief sought in both sets of proceedings arises out of the same
matrix of
facts and will depend upon substantially similar factual and legal issues.  In
these circumstances Mr Bathurst submitted
that it does not lie in the mouth of
Mr England to complain that he is being vexed by proceedings when he has taken
the view that
it is necessary for him to bring proceedings for relief, and when
he has conceded the entitlement of the defendants to his proceedings
not only
to defend them, but also to bring forward a counter claim.  Mr England's
submission was that as all issues could be determined
in one set of
proceedings, it was inappropriate to require him to be contesting another set
of proceedings raising the same issues.
<P>

28	In these circumstances Mr Bathurst submitted that Bell Coal was entitled to
have the New South Wales proceedings go forward in
the way in which it wished
to plead them, and that there could be no criticism of Bell Coal's instituting
the proceedings, which
it did, so he submitted, in a timely manner after Mr
England's purported avoidance and without notice of the South Australian
proceedings
having been instituted.
<P>

29	Mr Bathurst also submitted that the concession made by Mr Whitington in
relation to  Mr England's not opposing a grant of leave
did not extend to the
trust case, which Bell Coal wished to raise, and that this may be a matter
which might cause Bell Coal difficulties
if leave was sought to counter-claim
in the South Australian proceedings.  I am not certain why it would lead to any
difficulties
if consent was given to leave being granted in the South
Australian proceedings on other issues.  It seems to me that if leave is
granted on certain issues, the Court would grant leave on others relevant to
those issues, unless it was satisfied that there was
no prima facie case.
<P>

30	Mr Whitington also submitted that judgment in the South Australian
proceedings would be determinative of all issues between the
parties and
therefore constitute either a <i>res judicata</i> or an issue estoppel, subject
only to the possibility that Bell Coal, if successful, would have to lodge a
Proof of Debt to enforce
the judgment.  Mr Bathurst submitted that unless the
issues were formulated in the precise way in which Bell Coal wished to do,
there
could be difficulties in determining the extent to which there was a
<i>res judicata </i> or issue estoppel.  He referred to the divergent views
which had been expressed on this point, on the facts of particular cases,
many
of which cases were gathered in <b>Macquarie Bank Limited v National Mutual
Life Association of Australia Limited &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 543.</a>  In
that case, of course, it will be remembered that on this point there was a
division in the Court of Appeal.  The lengthy judgment
of Clarke JA, in which
Priestley JA agreed, points out the areas for dispute, as does the dissenting
judgment of Powell JA.
<P>

31	Mr Whitington also submitted that it was inappropriate to allow the New
South Wales proceedings to go forward because they are
predicated on a result
in the proceedings between Mr England and the Australian Taxation Office and,
until that has been resolved,
at least certain of the issues raised in the New
South Wales proceedings cannot be determined finally.  However, it was not in
issue
that there were other matters which are now susceptible of decision and,
if that dispute is not resolved at the time of the hearing
of the proceedings,
in whichever Court that may happen, it will be necessary for the Court to seek
to mould relief having regard
to that fact.
<P>

<b>The Exercise Of Discretion</b>
<P>

32	In the way in which the matter was argued the essential issue is whether I
should grant leave, and therefore allow Bell Coal's
proceedings to go forward
on the pleadings it has structured, or whether I should refuse to do so and
thereby require Bell Coal to
litigate the matter on which it seeks a decision
via its Defence and a Counter-Claim.  Obviously those pleadings will be
formulated
by the legal representatives for Bell Coal, so that there can be no
suggestion that Bell Coal will be precluded from putting its
case in the way it
wishes.  I am sure that is legal advisers will be astute to ensure that all
proper issues are raised.  Much, if
not, all of the force is taken out of the
submission that leave will be needed to bring a Counter-Claim by Mr England's
concession
in relation to it.  As I have said it is somewhat difficult to
conceive of a situation in which leave would be granted to pursue
some, but not
other, relief in the South Australian proceedings, unless the view was taken in
that Court that Bell Coal had not established
a prima facie right to that
relief. 
<P>

33	I do not overlook that Bell Coal regularly instituted the New South Wales
proceedings without notice that the South Australian
proceedings had been
commenced and in a timely fashion after being advised of Mr England's purported
avoidance.  Whilst its proceedings
were not commenced first, in point of time,
they were the first proceedings notified between the parties.  Whilst the New
South Wales
proceedings raise a prima facie case, which will have to be
litigated, and, in my view, Bell Coal is entitled to have it litigated
on the
way in which it wishes to plead the case, I do not see how it will be deprived
of that advantage by litigating such issues
in the South Australian
proceedings.  When the matter is viewed in this light it becomes apparent that
the New South Wales proceedings
become additional proceedings, which, on the
view I take, are not necessary for the resolution of all matters between the
parties.
 In those circumstances, consistently with the authorities to which I
have referred, Mr England is confronted with proceedings which,
in my opinion,
are not necessary.  Thus it can be said that the New South Wales proceedings
are "unnecessary proceedings", and that
Bell Coal has not established that the
balance of convenience requires the grant of leave.  For these reasons I
consider this the
appropriate characterisation of the proceedings and the
situation, and, accordingly, I have come to the view that the proper exercise
of discretion demands that leave not be granted.
<P>

<b>Two Sets Of Proceedings</b>
<P>

34	Mr Whitington also submitted that as a matter of discretion I should not
grant leave because the South Australian proceedings
are well advanced, as he
put it, and, accordingly, when coupled with his submission that all matters can
be determined in those proceedings,
it is not appropriate that leave be
granted.  The South Australian proceedings have reached the stage where a
Defence and a Reply
have been filed, although it is tolerably clear that all
the pleadings will require some further particularisation.  I do not regard
those proceedings, which have only been on foot as between the parties, in the
sense of Bell Coal's having knowledge of them, since
late January 1999, as
realistically very much more advanced than the present proceedings.  I do not
consider that this matter would
have been sufficient to exercise the discretion
to not grant leave.  However, taken in conjunction with my primary view it adds
some
weight to it.
<P>

	<b>The Position Of The Liquidator</b>
<P>

35	Mr Bathurst submitted that s.471B does not, in terms, require a party to
obtain leave to proceed against a liquidator.  That
is so.  Mr Whitington
submitted that there was authority for the proposition that leave should be
granted to proceed against a liquidator.
  Because of the conclusion to which I
have come in relation to Bell Coal's application it is not necessary for me to
pursue this
matter, although I believe that if I had granted leave to proceed
against UBN, I would also have granted that leave against Mr England.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

35	The parties did not specifically address me as to costs, although in the
correspondence emanating from the solicitors for UBN
and Mr England it was made
clear that they would be seeking costs in the event of the application for
leave not succeeding.  I am
prepared to assume that if Bell Coal had been the
successful party it would have sought an order for costs.  In my opinion, there
are several matters which are very relevant to an award of costs on this Notice
of Motion.  I accept that normally the successful
party is entitled to costs.
Those matters are, firstly, the failure to advise of the institution of the
South Australian proceedings.
Had Bell Coal been so advised it may have
litigated through them, rather than commence the New South Wales proceedings;
and, secondly,
and in my opinion more importantly, the failure by Mr England to
make any concession in relation to leave to proceed by way of a
Counter-Claim
until the hearing of the Notice of Motion was well advanced.  This concession
enables the view to be taken that all
matters in issue can be litigated in the
one set of proceedings or, put another way, removes an impediment to that
occurring.  This
is the essential reason why Bell Coal has failed, but the
position was stated too late, in my opinion, by Mr England.
<P>

36	In all the circumstances my prima facie view is that UBN and Mr England are
not entitled to their costs of this Notice of Motion,
and that the proper order
is that all parties should pay their own costs.  However, as this question was
not argued I shall reserve
leave to the parties to make submissions if they
wish.  If the parties are prepared to accept my prima facie view a joint
memorandum
stating that should be furnished to my Associate and I shall make
the order in Chambers.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

 (1)	I order that the plaintiff's Notice of Motion for leave to proceed be
dismissed.
<P>

(2)	I reserve for further argument, if need be, the question of costs.
<P>

(3)	I order that the exhibits be returned.
