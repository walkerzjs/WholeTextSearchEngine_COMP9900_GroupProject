TUESDAY 26 OCTOBER 1999
<P>

<b>3749/98 -  BARBARA LACKEY  v  JOAN LIDDLE - ESTATE OF DONALD KENNETH
THOMPSON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application in respect of the estate of the
late Donald Kenneth Thompson, who died on 28 April 1998 aged
74 years.  The
deceased was survived by the plaintiff, a former wife.  He is also survived by
his and the plaintiff's son, Kenneth
James Thompson, who has also brought
proceedings. Those proceedings have been compromised and I will refer to them
shortly.  The
deceased had two other wives, one - her name is Valerie - was
apparently someone to whom he was married prior to 1952, and the third
wife was
someone known as Leonie.  The evidence before me suggests that both of these
persons are dead and I accept that evidence,
which came from the deceased's
sister.  She had contact with the deceased over many years and no doubt has an
appropriate basis for
that evidence.
<P>

2  	The will of the deceased was made on 26 February 1988. Under that
will he appointed his sister the executrix. He gave a bequest
to a friend of
his, Rhonda Marshall, of some 600 shares in the National Bank and 600 shares in
the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
which on today's values are worth about
$37,000.  He gave to his son, Kenneth Thompson, his property at Doonside.  The
rest of the
estate passed to Joan Liddle and her husband, Desmond Liddle, as
joint tenants.
<P>

3  	The estate consisted of the deceased's house and also a
substantial number of shares.  The house at Doonside has a value of
$150,000.
The value of the estate at the date of hearing is approximately $665,000.  This
includes the house at $150,000.  Because
there are shares in there  are capital
gains tax implications on the transfer or distribution of the property.  The
maximum capital
gains tax liability that might be incurred is some $77,353, and
that may in fact be partly postponed if there are some shares distributed
in
specie.  In any event, obviously some of it will apply and there will be a sale
to meet expenses and the legacy in favour of Kenneth.
<P>

4  	The terms of the compromise with Kenneth, which I have approved
since they do not impact on this case, provide for him still
to receive the
property, worth $150,000, to receive the rents that have been accumulated, and
also to receive the sum of $130,000.
 Having regard to the capital gains tax
figure at its maximum and the estate's expenses for costs in these proceedings,
the amount
of the estate will reduce to $552,167.75.  Taking out the properties
and the legacy that will pass to Kenneth, there is left approximately
$270,000.
If one takes off the amount of the legacy to Rhonda Marshall of some $27,000,
one is left with $243,000.  In the event
that the plaintiff is successful, her
costs, which are estimated on solicitor and client basis at $25,000, would be
payable in part
from the estate.  This leaves an estate in the order of some
$220,000, with possibilities of increase if some shares are transferred
in
species.
<P>

5  	Clearly the plaintiff is an eligible person, being a former wife
of the deceased.  It is necessary, however, for the plaintiff
also to establish
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> that there are factors
warranting the making of the application. 
<P>

6  	The question of factors as warranting in respect of former
spouses has been dealt with in a number of cases.  In Dijkhuijs (formerly
Coney) v Barclay  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20639" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 639</a>, a number of the Judges dealt with this
matter .  Kirby P had the following to say: 
<P>

"Fifthly, the respondent, picking up one of the themes of Mr Landa's comments,
urged that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9(1)</a> of the Act was to be read in the light of the policy of the
law to promote the finality of settlements of property disputes by orders
made
in the Family Court.  Where such orders had been made, an order under the Act
in the case of a former spouse should be exceptional.
 Only if this approach
were adopted would the policy of the Family Law Act (Cth) be fully achieved.
That policy is that parties whose
marriage has been dissolved and in respect of
whom orders have been made disposing of their matrimonial property, could go
their
separate ways .  Save for the rare and exceptional cases provided under
the Family Law Act (Cth), such parties should henceforth
face no financial
obligation from one to the other.  This public policy was referred to by Young
J in O'Shaughnessy (at 149).  It
was also stressed by his Honour in the present
case.  There is no doubt that in most cases, the achievement of a final
property settlement
in the Family Court would be seen by the parties, in
current social circumstances, as terminating any moral claim of a former spouse
to provision in the will of the other.  Confronted by the news that he or she
had been excluded from the will of the former spouse,
the response would, in
the overwhelming majority of cases, be: 'Our marriage was dissolved.  We
settled our financial affairs. We
can each start a new life.  That was the
whole point of the Family Court proceedings.'  To this extent, I agree with
what Young J
has written in O'Shaughnessy and in this case." 
<P>

7  	         Mahoney JA said the following: 
<P>

"That which the court `shall first determine' is whether `there are factors
which warrant the making of the application'. That phrase
may be contrasted
with the references otherwise made to the determination of, for example, `what
provision (if any) ought to be made
in favour of an eligible person...'. On the
face of s 9(1) there is a distinction between `factors which warrant the making
of the
application' and factors  which warrant the making of an order. 
<P>

That distinction accords with the principle which, in my opinion, is inherent
in the legislation, viz, that, special cases apart,
an order is to be made only
if the deceased has made default in the performance of a duty which he owed to
the particular plaintiff.
 I do not think that this case requires a final
analysis of the basis of applications under the Act:  It will be sufficient to
refer
to this matter in general terms.  But the Act authorises the court to
`order that such provision be made out of the estate or notional
estate, or
both, of the deceased person as, in the opinion of the Court, ought, having
regard to the circumstances at the time the
order is made, to be made for the
maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person' (s 7).
That does not mean
that, if the plaintiff establishes a financial need within
the section and if on taking into account the considerations referred
to in s
9(2) (the discretionary considerations) there be nothing to the contrary, an
order must be made.  The statute assumes that
the deceased, in what he has done
during his life and by his will, has failed to discharge a duty which he owed
to the plaintiff
(the moral duty).  Thus, a plaintiff may be a former spouse
who, on dissolution of the marriage, received what on any view she was
entitled
to have and there may have been no further relationship between them so that
none of the factors in s 9(3)(a) to s 9(3)(c),
are of relevance.  But, at the
deceased's death, she may have a financial need.  In such circumstances, the
fact that the plaintiff
has established that she was a former spouse and has a
financial need would not, as such, entitle her to an order.  It would be
necessary
for her to establish that, in some way or because of circumstances
within s 9(3)(d), the deceased had a duty to her which involved
that he should
have provided for her financial need.  This will be so a foreshore where the
basis for the eligibility of the plaintiff
is alleged to be within par (d) of
the definition of `eligible person'."      Importantly, it can be seen that the
question of need
is a separate matter and factors warranting are something
different from that. 
<P>

8  	In another case, Churton v Christian  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 241</a>, his
Honour Priestley JA said the following, in respect of this type of application:

<P>

"Mrs Christian is a member of a class in respect of whom warranting factors may
often be more difficult to find.  It is common experience
that divorce
sometimes brings to an end all links between previously married people.  In
such cases, warranting factors might well
be expected usually to be absent,
although this need not be universally so.  On the other hand, divorced persons
may remain on close
terms, sometimes little different from those on which they
lived when married.  In every case it is necessary to examine the actual
relationship between the two people concerned, as far as possible without
preconceptions based only on the fact of divorce." 
<P>

9  	In his comments he illustrated a situation which sometimes
applies after there has been a divorce and a property settlement:
 Namely, that

<P>

10  	The parties still continue to have a close association.
<P>

11  	There has also been in recent times further attention to this
matter in the Court of Appeal in the case of Brown v Faggoter,
a decision given
on 13 November 1998, which is a decision of Sheller JA, Sheppard and Fitzgerald
AJJA.  The main judgment was given
by Fitzgerald AJA, who seemed to suggest
that an application might be warranted if the application has reasonable
prospects of success.
 This seems to be a somewhat different and perhaps easier
test than what was referred to in the other cases of the Court of Appeal
to
which I have referred.  I will consider the matter on both bases, given that
there may be some flux in the state of the law in
this regard.
<P>

12  	Before addressing the facts on this aspect I should give some of
the chronology of the matter.  The deceased was born in 1924
in India.  He came
to Australia after the War.  In 1927 the deceased's sister, Joan Liddle, who is
the defendant, was born. The plaintiff,
Barbara Lackey, was born on 28 February
1934.  Apparently the deceased separated from his first wife in 1952 and he
commenced cohabitation
with the plaintiff in 1954.  They were married on 3
March 1956 and their son Kenneth was born on 3 June 1956.  In late 1956 the
deceased
and the plaintiff separated.  Apparently they were divorced in 1959 on
the ground of the plaintiff's adultery.
<P>

13  	The evidence before me contained references to the circumstances
of the plaintiff's separation from the deceased.  The only
evidence before me
is that of the plaintiff, and that suggests that the plaintiff in fact
separated before she met a person in 1957
with whom she subsequently formed a
relationship and by whom she had a child.  The reason for the separation,
according the plaintiff,
was the deceased's sexual preferences.  In any event,
they went their separate ways thereafter, but there are a few things to be
noted about what happened on that occasion.
<P>

14  	There was in fact no property settlement.  The reason for that
was that the plaintiff was very attached to her son, who was
only some months
old.  She was threatened, according to her, by the deceased with a claim for
custody if she tried to obtain anything
from the deceased by way of property
settlement. In the result, the deceased kept the business and the property,
which was subsequently
sold by him.  He retained the proceeds.
<P>

15  	The deceased remarried in due course, as did the plaintiff.  She
remarried in 1964 and she was divorced in 1975.  There are
a number of children
by that relationship, four in all, and clearly both she and the deceased lived
their separate lives for many
years after they parted ways in 1956.  In the
early 1980s, however, there was further contact between the deceased and the
plaintiff
and they continued to see each other on what the plaintiff describes
as a friendship basis.  I will come back to that in due course.
 The deceased
made his will in 1988 and he died in 1988. Probate was taken out and the
summons issued within time.
<P>

16  	The factual matters which are advanced as factors warranting are
a number. First, there was no property settlement in this
case. The only
evidence is to that effect and there is a reason why there was no property
settlement sought by the plaintiff. The
only property that appeared to have
been accumulated over the period of their somewhat short marriage was taken by
the deceased.
 
<P>

17  	From the early 1980s it seems that the parties, according to the
plaintiff, would occasionally come together in the sense that
the deceased
might come and stay with the plaintiff at her house or she would do the same.
It is not suggested that this happened
frequently, but every few months or so.
There is no suggestion of a renewal of any sexual relationship; it was merely
friendship.
The fact that there was some friendship there is demonstrated by
one matter which is supported by some documentary evidence.  In
1989 the
deceased, when discussing matters with the plaintiff at his home, opened a
briefcase with a number of papers in it and said
to the plaintiff that "All
these shares belong to you, if anything happens to me, see Joan. If you want to
sell them, she'll do it
for you."
<P>

18  	The papers were retained by the deceased, they were not given to
the plaintiff.  In due course, not unnaturally, the defendant
did not know of
any such arrangement.  The plaintiff remembered the name of one of the
companies concerned, which was a company known
as Tindal, and she approached
them to get some information about investments that might be in her name.  The
result is that there
have been produced copies of investments made in Estate
Mortgage Income Trust which are filled out in the plaintiff's name and contain
what appears to be her signature.  Apart from two documents which were an
application form for investments which she says she signed,
the balance of the
documents are in the handwriting of the deceased and the deceased has written,
according to the plaintiff, her
signature.
<P>

19  	The facts are clear that these were investments of the deceased.
He provided the funds, and the plaintiff makes no suggestion
that she provided
any funds.  The fact that the deceased in effect treated them as his own by
signing the plaintiff's name to move
and change investments probably indicates
that he thought he had control of them during his lifetime and they were
something that
he was providing for the plaintiff after his death.  In these
circumstances, it seems to me that there is evidence of friendship
demonstrated. Other possible scenarios might, of course, include the deceased
not wishing to have the shares in his name for some
reason.  There is nothing
in the evidence that would suggest that this was the case.  Certainly there was
no arrangement made with
the plaintiff.  If there was some income-splitting
motive one would have thought there would be documents that might have
indicated
it.
<P>

20  	There was, as I say, this contact.  It has been suggested that
it may have been just because of the circumstances of the grandchildren.
However, that does not appear to be the case on the evidence before me.  The
extent of the visiting by each of the deceased and the
plaintiff included
matters done by the plaintiff for the deceased which one would expect if they
were friends.  For example, doing
things such as washing, ironing, cooking
meals, cleaning their respective places.  All these matters are important
aspects of what
might be called the factors warranting in the traditional
sense.
<P>

21  	Of particular importance is the lack of a property settlement
and the fact that the plaintiff bore the brunt of bringing up
the child of the
parties and that the deceased took the only property involved in the marriage.
This is not a situation where the
parties have made a clean break and started
their lives all over again in the sense of having had a property settlement in
the terms
used by judges in the cases to which I have referred.  There was in
addition the friendship in later years, which I think is manifest
by the
intentions of the deceased to which I have referred.
<P>

22  	In these circumstances, in the traditional sense I would be
satisfied that there were factors warranting.  However, to the
extent that
recent authority might indicate that the test is whether there are prospects of
success I will refer to the prospects
of success and whether it is appropriate
for there to be an order.  
<P>

23  	The High Court has recently in Singer and Berghouse set out a
two-stage process that a court must make.  Page 209 it said the
following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant have regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

24  	The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves
similar considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the
process, the court
may need to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance
and what is adequate provision,
in which event, if it becomes necessary to
embark upon the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely
determine the
order which should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying
that, we are mindful that there may be some circumstances in which
a court
could refuse to make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to
have been left without adequate provision for
proper maintenance.  Take, for
example, a case like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from
which an order could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the
testator's arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

25  	When one turns to the plaintiff's situation one finds that she
is a lady with virtually no assets.  She has a 1971 Datsun motor
vehicle worth
about $800, personal property and furniture of little value.  She has a few
liabilities in the order of $577.  Her
income is the age pension in the sum of
$364.30 per fortnight and she lives in rental premises which apparently cost
her $70 per
week.  She has living with her a 33-year-old son who apparently
pays her $70 per week board.  It seem fairly clear that her income
is totally
used on her expenses.
<P>

26  	The plaintiff does not advance a case which she claims that a
substantial award should be made to her.  The court has to consider
the way in
which she has been left without adequate and proper provision for her
maintenance, education and advancement in life.
 In this respect she merely
advances a number of matters concerning advancement.  The first one is that her
motor vehicle is a 1971
Datsun, which apparently is not very reliable.  She has
a need for a car as her mentally retarded son lives at a flat at Charlestown
under the auspices of the Department of Youth and Community Services. She needs
to visit him frequently when he has epileptic fits
or turns and accordingly
needs a reliable car.  She also takes him to a number of venues connected with
his sporting activities as
a disabled athlete.  The cost of a Nissan Pulsar
sedan is in evidence before me, being $24,933.  She also wishes to have some
new
electrical appliances costing to $7,138 and some furniture costing $4,038.
These are modest requests for someone living in rented
accommodation.
<P>

27  	It is also, of course, necessary to consider the situation of
others who have a claim on the bounty of the deceased.  There
is the
beneficiary Rhonda Marshall who received a bequest, and it is not suggested
that that bequest should be disturbed.  The other
person who has to be
considered is the defendant, Joan Liddle, and her husband. The defendant is 72
and apparently they do not have
dependent children living with them.
Previously they had farmed a property and have retired.  As is inevitable with
a number of retired
people, unfortunately, they have seen their capital erode
since retirement.  However, their situation at the present time, so far
as
assets are concerned, appears to be as follows.
<P>

28  	They have a home at Forestville worth about $200,000. They have
shares in public companies of $74,000, an investment property
at Underwood of
$84,000 and a small amount in the bank.  They do not have significant
liabilities but shortly they will have to spend
some funds, probably slightly
in excess of some $20,000, on their home.  Their income is not substantial.
Basically, it is in the
order of some $24,000 to $25,000 and their expenses are
a little less than that.  As I have mentioned, they have been eating into
their
capital reserves.
<P>

29  	The defendant was the sister of the deceased.  They had a long
and close association from childhood and clearly that close
association
continued throughout the deceased's life. It is very obvious that the deceased
would wish to make provision for his sister.
 However, there is, even after the
allowance of the provision made for the son, Kenneth, in the settlement of his
matter, still some
$220,000 in the estate, and in the circumstances I think a
modest legacy is called for.  In these circumstances there are prospects
of
success so I am also satisfied on this ground that there are factors warranting
the making of the application.
<P>

30  	The plaintiff seeks a legacy of $50,000 to $60,000. Bearing in
mind the factors to which I have referred and the evidence,
some of which I
have referred to, I will award a legacy of $35,000.  I make the following
orders:
<P>

1.   That the plaintiff receive a legacy out of the estate of the deceased in
the sum of $35,000.
<P>

2.   Order the plaintiff's costs on a party-and-party basis and the defendant's
on an indemnity basis to be paid or retained out
of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

3.   Exhibits to be returned
<P>

                           oOo
