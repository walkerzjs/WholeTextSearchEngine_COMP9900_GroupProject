Wednesday, 10 March 199
<P>

<b>3151 of 1997 DIANA MARGARET SIMPSON v BRUCH NAPIER BARKER </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  This is an application under the <b>Defacto
Relationships Act</b> for adjustment of the parties' property interests.  The
parties lived together in a defacto relationship from May 1983 until January
1996.  There is no dispute about the existence of the relationship.  There were
no children of the relationship although each of
the parties had previously
been married and had children from that marriage.  However, throughout the
relevant period the parties'
children were adult, or almost so, and no
questions of parenting contributions arise.  The plaintiff, who was born on 31
July 1939
is now 59 years of age and the defendant who was born on 9 June 1940
is now 58 years of age.  
<P>

2	The parties had met early in 1982 and when they commenced their relationship
in May 1983 they lived at Woollahra in premises which
were owned by the
defendant with his brothers.  At that stage the plaintiff had commenced working
for Home Care at Bondi and the
defendant was working as a Logistics Manager for
Gilbarco.  The property at Woollahra was sold in 1985 and the parties moved to
306
High Street, Chatswood and lived in the property owned by the defendant's
mother.  The parties occupied a granny flat at the rear
of the premises and
paid no rent.  About this time the plaintiff obtained employment at Fisher
Industries assembling electronic printed
circuit boards which position she held
for over ten years.  In June 1985 the defendant purchased in his name 5.5
hectares of land
near Berry known as 289 Brogers Creek Road, Woodhill.  The
purchase price was $56,000 and with stamp duty and legal costs the actual
cost
was some $58,000.  A mortgage was taken out for some $37,000 at the time of
purchase and the balance of the funds, to which
I will refer in more detail,
came from the defendant.  
<P>

3	Over the next few years the parties worked on the vacant land to get it ready
for the erection of a house and in due course in
1987 a kit home was purchased
for about $21,000.  Construction of that on the Berry land commenced.  
<P>

4	In 1992 the plaintiff, with the permission of the defendant, had travelled to
England to visit her family who lived there and
she was away for some three
months.  She returned and cohabitation resumed.  Even though the property at
Berry had been completed
to a live-in stage the parties continued to reside at
the flat at Chatswood since they both worked in Sydney.  Berry was really a
holiday retreat which the parties had planned as home for their retirement.

<P>

5	In December 1994 the plaintiff ceased to work at Fisher Industries and she
and the defendant travelled to the United Kingdom for
holidays for a period of
some two months.  On their return the defendant returned to his employment and
the plaintiff started working
for Dial-an-Angel house cleaning.
<P>

6	After separation in January 1996 the defendant moved out of the Chatswood
premises and the plaintiff remained there until the
end of July 1997.  She then
left the Chatswood premises and moved to the Central Coast where she now
resides with her daughter.
<P>

7	At the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff had little in the way
of assets.  Her assets consisted of clothes, personal
items and a minor amount
of furniture which she was given by her husband.  Prior to the commencement of
the relationship the defendant
had entered into consent orders for a property
settlement which meant that the former matrimonial home was transferred to his
wife.
 He owned with his brothers a property at Woollahra which had previously
been occupied by his father who was by then in a nursing
home.  What the value
of his interest was does not appear although ultimately he received
approximately $46,000 as a result of the
sale and distribution of the proceeds
in 1985.
<P>

8	At the completion of the relationship the plaintiff was virtually in the same
position as she was at the commencement.  She had
few personal items, no cash
saved and had nothing else.  The defendant at the completion of the
relationship had the land at Berry
in his name.  That is now valued at
$245,000.  At the time of separation there were amounts outstanding on bank
loans for its purchase
of some $13,080.  Since separation the defendant has
repaid that loan.  The defendant also had a Nissan car which he valued at
$8,000
which has subsequently had money expended on it and was recently traded
in on another car by him for $4,000.  
<P>

9	It can be seen from the recounting of the above history and the assets of the
parties that the main focus of the parties' assets
centred upon the property at
Berry.  The defendant had during his employment with Gilbarco been in a
superannuation fund and as 19
February 1986 the amount of the total benefit he
was entitled to at that stage was $140,918.58.  Part of this, namely,
$18,491.43
was indicated as being before 1983.  The plaintiff did suggest that
this financial resource of the defendant was one which has been
contributed to
by the plaintiff.  There is no doubt, and I will deal with it later, that the
plaintiff contributed the whole of her
wages towards the purchase of food for
the household and any balance over, apart from minor matters for herself, was
given by her
to the defendant for the joint purposes of the relationship.  In
<b>Green v Robinson</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%2096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 96</a> the Court, inter alia, dealt with
the way superannuation should be dealt with.  His Honour, the President, at p
11 of the judgment
had the following to say in relation to superannuation:
<P>

	"It is as erroneous to ascribe the superannuation payments to the separate and
differentiated income of the parties as it is to
ignore superannuation
altogether.  Despite equal pay legislation, and industrial decisions to the
same end, it is well known that
in Australia, female earnings are typically
lower than male earnings. Inherent in the notion that each 'owns' the
superannuation
entitlements accumulated from his or her income, in an
inescapable bias against vulnerable (usually female) members of a marriage
or
marriage-like relationship.  This is a bias which the Act, far from condoning,
forbids.  By section 3(1), the Act requires, in
relation to 'de facto partners
or either of them', that the financial resources, which must be taken into
account under section 20(1)
of the Act, are to include entitlements under a
superannuation scheme.  This is therefore something which, in the exercise of
the
section 20(1) discretion, the Court must view as belonging not to Mr
Robinson separately however he actually banks or notionally
receives the
contingent benefit, but to the financial resources of the parties which need to
be adjusted, having regard to the contributions
'made directly or indirectly'
by them.  Conformably with the language of the Act and applicable jurisprudence
which has developed
in the Family Court on analogous problems, it is my view
that Ms Green made an indirect contribution to Mr Robinson's superannuation
entitlements.  Just as he did to hers.  The only difference is that his
entitlement was more substantial.  This was because of its
longer duration and
because of his higher base income.
<P>

	I shall assume that the contributions to superannuation made before the
relationship commenced to be disregarded.  See <b>Lipman v Lipman </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2013%20FAM%20LR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 13
FAM LR 1</a>;  DFC 95-068 (SCNSW).  Both parties argued the case on this basis,
although it is not without controversy and contrary opinions exist.
 See e.g.
<b>In The Marriage of Gill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%209%20FAM%20LR%20969" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 9 FAM LR 969.</a>
<P>

	The funds must therefore be reduced pro rata for the contributions made before
1974.  I agree generally in the approach of Cole
JA to this adjustment.  But,
with respect, the error in his Honour's approach, is to require, in effect,
proof by evidence of the
direct or indirect contributions made by Ms Green to
Mr Robinson's accumulating superannuation entitlements during the relationship.
Such proof is not required in cases under the Family Law Act.  In my view, the
express mention of superannuation entitlements in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto
Relationships Act</a>, makes it plain that Parliament accepted that ordinarily,
partners to such relationships would be making at least indirect, if not
direct, contribution to the accumulation of the form of savings which
superannuation constitutes.  That, in my view, gave Ms Green,
for the period of
the relationship at least, such a stake in that aspect of the 'financial
resources' of Mr Robinson, as must be
reflected in a 'just and equitable
order', designed to adjust the interests of the partners, as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1)</a> of
the Act requires."
<P>

10		Powell J at p 9 of his judgment referred to the need to establish that one
of the parties had in some way contributed to the
other's superannuation
entitlements and that by reason of that contribution, it was "just and
equitable" that some order based upon,
or derived from, those entitlements
should be made.  Cole JA dealt with the matter on pp 11 and 12 of his judgment
and inclined to
the view that there was no evidence in the case to suggest that
the appellant had made any contribution, direct or indirect, to the
respondent's present superannuation entitlement, it being a deduction from his
service pay.  He held that a similar situation pertained
to the appellant's
superannuation.
<P>

11		It is not easy to reconcile the different views but it would appear from
the comments of Powell J and Cole JA that there must
be some factual matter
which enables one to form the view that there had been a contribution to a
spouse's superannuation entitlements.
 A common example of this would be a
partner who stays at home to look after children thus enabling the other
partner to go to work
and earn a superannuation entitlement.
<P>

12	In the circumstances of this case there does not seem to be any factual
basis for suggesting that the plaintiff did contribute
in any way to the
defendant's financial resources.  A submission was made to the effect that the
handing over of the balance of the
plaintiff's salary allowed the defendant to
devote some of his wages to his superannuation.  The majority in <b>Green v
Robinson </b>seems to require a greater factual proof than that identified in
the submission.  The submission is more consistent with the approach
of the
President in his dissenting judgment.  It seems to me therefore that in this
case there would be no contribution to that financial
resource of the defendant
to be taken into account in the adjustment process.  If the evidence is
available it might, however, be
appropriate to deduct the defendant's
superannuation contributions from his general financial contribution to the
parties' joint
endeavours to which I will later refer.
<P>

13	I turn to the contributions to the purchase of the Berry property and the
construction of the improvements thereon.  I will deal
with the financial
contributions at this stage.  As I have indicated the purchase price of the
Berry land was $56,000.  On 23 April
1985 the defendant received the sum of
$43,132 and on 27 March 1985 the sum of $3,200.31.  These sums were the amounts
which he received
from the distribution following the sale of the Woollahra
property that was owned by him and his brothers.  The purchase in July
was made
using a loan of $37,000 from a credit union.  These funds of approximately
$80,000 were used for the following purposes.
<P>

$58,000 was applied by the defendant to purchase the land and pay expenses of
purchase.
<P>

$6,000 was used for the costs of making an access road to the house when, in
due course, it was built.
<P>

$2,700 was used for power reticulation.
<P>

$1,000 was used for plumbing.
<P>

The defendant purchased a Nissan vehicle for $13,800.
<P>

14	Between December 1985 and 1987 the parties arranged a number of further
loans and got together funds in order to obtain a kit
home which cost them
$21,000.  It was acquired in June 1987.  Two personal loans were taken out, one
by the defendant for $2,000
and one by the plaintiff for $8,500.  This loan was
taken out in the plaintiff's name because she had a salary which could support
it and the defendant could not, because of his other loans, increase his
borrowing.  It is not disputed that the loan the plaintiff
took out was repaid
out of the defendant's bank account.  The plaintiff never had a bank account
and the defendant operated all the
finances.  In addition other funds were
contributed being $5,400 from a tax credit which the defendant received and
$5,500 from the
sale of a Ford car which the plaintiff described as his car.  A
further loan of $9,400 in the name of the defendant and a further
loan in the
name of the plaintiff for $2,700 were taken out.  All of these funds were used
for the purpose of the home, fitting out
and for other expenses of the
parties.
<P>

15	From a consideration of the above it can be seen that the direct
contributions in cash by the defendant amounted to $57,232 and
the that the
balance of the purchase price of the two major assets, namely, the house and
the Nissan car, came from loan funds. 
This leads one to the question of how
the loans were repaid and the extent of their repayment by the parties over the
period of the
relationship.
<P>

16	Each party has given evidence of their financial situation in respect of
income.  In order to make the comparisons relevant I
will not deduct the
plaintiff's Medicare Levy.  For the plaintiff the situation is as follows:-
<P>

<b>Taxable Income less Tax</b>
<P>

	1988                 $10,854
<P>

	1989                 $15,212
<P>

	1990                 $16,600
<P>

	1991                 $18,809
<P>

	1992                 $16,094
<P>

	1993                 $19,926
<P>

	1994                 $20,789
<P>

	1995                <u> $ 9,054</u>
<P>

	                    <u>$127,338</u>
<P>

	
<P>

17	On the defendant's part he was employed at a somewhat higher gross salary
and his earnings for the relevant period were as follows:-
<P>

	<b>Group Certificate Less Tax</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>1983                 $19,152
<P>

	1984                 $19,752
<P>

	1985                 $21,071
<P>

	1986                 $22,397
<P>

	1987                 $23,959
<P>

	1988                 $26,037
<P>

	1989                 $26,929
<P>

	1990                 $30,820
<P>

	1991                 $33,255
<P>

	1992                 
<P>

	1993                 $33,205
<P>

	1994                 $34,132
<P>

	1995                 <u>$35,368</u>
<P>

	                    <u>$326,077</u>
<P>

18	Making inferences where the evidence is wanting, the plaintiff's net salary
is in the order of $175,000 and the defendant's $360,000
for the period
1983-1995.
<P>

19	Not all the defendant's income can be taken to account for these purposes
because a sum of $82,674 was paid by the defendant
over the years from his
salary as maintenance to his former spouse.  In 1998 his contributions to
superannuation were $1,263.  Using
the increase in salary as a yardstick, his
total contributions over the period are likely to be in the order of
$12,000.
<P>

20	It is important to realise that in this case the parties have lived quite a
Spartan lifestyle.  They lived frugally and clothes
were bought from K-Mart.
There was no suggestion that there was any extravagance and apart from payments
to the former wife, the
payments were for the benefit of the relationship.
Thus one has the plaintiff's wages being used initially for food on a Thursday
night when she was paid and the balance being given over to the defendant.  The
amount could be $200, $100 or $20 on any given week.
 The total amount borrowed
was $59,600.  The actual principal owing as at separation was $13,080 leaving
the amount by which the
principal was reduced to $46,520.
<P>

21	After taking out payments by the defendant to his former wife for
maintenance and payments for superannuation one can see that
the proportion of
contribution by each of the plaintiff and the defendant to household expenses,
repayment of mortgages and other
charges concerning the joint property, namely,
the property at Berry and the car, were in the proportion of approximately 175
to
265.  The contributions of each to the reduction in the principal sum under
the mortgage was as to the plaintiff $18,502 and the
defendant $28,017.  The
defendant over a period of some years contributed cash of $57,232 making his
total contribution $85,249.
 This makes the proportion of each person's
contribution to the capital assets (the Berry property and the Nissan)
approximately
18 percent by the plaintiff and 82 percent by the defendant.  I
say, approximate, because it does not take full account of the time
value of
money amongst other things.  The parties' work, and hence their salaries, was
of quite a different nature.  No submission
was made that I should take into
account in the final balancing process what might be perceived to be an
entrenched inequality in
female wages and no evidence was led in this regard.
See <b>Gazzard v Winders, </b>Court of Appeal 23 July 1998 and my comments in
<b>Anderson v Charlton</b> 5 August 1998.
<P>

22	I turn to the non-financial contributions.  One of the major non-financial
contributions concerned the parties endeavours in
procuring the property at
Berry.  There was also work in preparation of the ground to enable the house to
be built.  The parties
substantially did this work on weekends and most of
their weekends were spent at Berry either preparing the land or building the
house.
<P>

23	In paragraph 20 the defendant described the work he did as follows:-
<P>

Excavation by hand for piers
<P>

Concreting and bricklaying
<P>

Construction, assembly and erection of the house from and flooring
<P>

All external plumbing and drainage
<P>

All internal  plumbing
<P>

Installation of a water supply system from a creek to the house
<P>

All internal gyprock fixing to walls and ceiling
<P>

Floor and wall tiling in wet areas
<P>

All internal joinery
<P>

Re-fencing all the property boundaries, gate installation etc.
<P>

Installation of a ground water supply for stock
<P>

Trenching for underground electricity supply
<P>

24	It is not disputed by the plaintiff that the defendant did this work and it
is not disputed that the plaintiff herself was a
willing pair of hands and
assisted enormously.  The plaintiff in her statement described the amount of
work she did in these terms.
<P>

Holding wall and ceiling gyprock whilst the defendant nailed the sheets into
place.
<P>

Climbing ladders and holding gutters and fascia in place whilst measurements
were taken or they were being affixed.
<P>

Generally assisting inside and outside the house in taking measurements and
holding beams, fittings and fixtures in place whilst
measurements were being
taken or they were being affixed.
<P>

Holding reels of barbed wire whilst new fences were being constructed around
the gardens (to keep the animals out).
<P>

Fetching tools and materials for the defendant whilst he was working.
<P>

Preparing meals.
<P>

Internal painting of walls and ceilings.
<P>

Sanding and painting doors, architraves and skirting boards.
<P>

Holding floor boards in place whilst they were being measured and affixed.
<P>

Helping with the tiling - holding tiles in place and helping the defendant
install show screen.
<P>

Assisting with measurements and holding beams for front and back verandahs.
<P>

25	Obviously there were other joint endeavours by both parties in the fitting
out and the final work that went into getting the
house almost finished.  At
the end of the evidence I had the strong impression that each party contributed
as fully and to the best
extent that each could given their knowledge and
physical capabilities.
<P>

26	So far as housekeeping contributions are concerned, it seems that the
plaintiff did the majority of matters such as cleaning
and cooking.  Although
these are matters which should be recognised in a substantial and not token
way, it should be appreciated
that in the present case the parties did not have
any children.  They were both working and accordingly the extent of household
contributions
are not the same as is the case where there is a family
comprising children.
<P>

27	It is thus a matter of balancing what are the respective contributions to
arrive at a just and equitable result.  The defendant
concedes that the
plaintiff would be entitled to some payment and suggests that 30 percent of the
present value of the house after
taking account of post-separation matters is
appropriate.  The plaintiff put her claim at 40 to 50 percent of the value of
the property
and the defendant's superannuation.
<P>

28	Following cessation of cohabitation it is clear that the plaintiff remained
in occupation for 15 or so months but there is no
evidence of the rental value
of such occupation.  It was also submitted that the defendant should be
credited for a contribution
during the period of the relationship consisting of
the rent free accommodation provided by his mother.  This is appropriate but
there is no evidence of the value of such accommodation.
<P>

29	Since separation the defendant has paid rates and insurance on the property
amounting to $3,360 and has discharged the mortgage
which was $13,080 as at
separation.  In dealing with the present value of the real estate which the
parties agree is $245,000 these
contributions should be taken into account.
<P>

30	So far as the Nissan is concerned it was worth $8,000 at separation.  The
defendant retained it and recently traded it in for
$4,000.  He also spent
$3,362 in essential repairs on the vehicle.  That was a matter which he should
bear and the plaintiff given
credit for the fact that assets include that
vehicle at its present value of $4,000.
<P>

31	Doing the best I can and taking into account the whole of the evidence, most
of which I have referred to, the identified financial
and non-financial
contributions, the appropriate order is that the defendant pay the plaintiff,
by way of adjustment of property
interest, the sum of $85,000.  
<P>

32	Accordingly, I order:-
<P>

1.	The defendant pay the plaintiff the sum of $85,000 by way of adjustment of
the parties' property interests within 60 days.
<P>

2.	Subject to any submissions, the defendant is to pay the plaintiff's
costs.
<P>

3.	Reserve liberty to apply for orders for sale of the property or other
enforcement if order 1 is not complied with by the defendant.
<P>
