<P>

<b>			THE CONSUMER CLAIMS TRIBUNALS &amp; </b>
<P>

			<b>ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Declarations:  jurisdiction of CCT)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By summons filed 7 June 1998 the plaintiff seeks
to appeal a decision of Mr G J Durie a Referee of the Consumer Claims Tribunal
(the tribunal) made on 13 May 1999.  The plaintiff relied on an affidavit of
Wayne Vincent Annis-Brown sworn 9 June 1999.  The second
defendant James
Stedman Advertising Pty Limited did not file any affidavit evidence.  The first
defendant the Registrar of the Consumer
Claims Tribunal filed a submitting
appearance.  The issue to be decided is whether or not the words "shall be
automatically renewed"
mean that at the expiry of initial term of the agreement
the parties entered into a fresh contract.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff seeks declarations that the Consumer Claims
Tribunals has no jurisdiction to hear and determine those matters
arising in a
claim by the second defendant against the plaintiff in proceedings before a
Tribunal numbered TSY98/1534 and that the
Referee G J Durie erred in law in
ruling that the Consumer Claims Tribunals has jurisdiction to hear and
determine the claim made
by the second defendant against the plaintiff.
Alternatively the plaintiff seeks an order in the nature of mandamus that the
proceedings
numbered TSY98/1534 in the Consumer Claims Tribunal be remitted to
the said Referee to be heard and determined according to law.
<P>

3  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12(2)(a)(i)</a> of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b>
1987 (the Act) gives this court the jurisdiction to grant relief in relation to
the hearing or determination of the claim if it has
given a ruling under s 26
of the Act which was erroneous.  The plaintiff concedes for present purposes
that the second defendant
is a consumer within the meaning of the Act;  the
claim made by the second defendant to the Tribunal was a consumer claim within
the meaning of the Act and that the consumer claim relates to goods supplied by
the plaintiff to the second defendant.
<P>

4  	On 13 June 1994 James Stedman Advertising Pty Limited as a renter
(second defendant) signed a rental agreement with Portfolio
Leasing Australia
Limited (the plaintiff  and the lessor).  The second defendant leased computer
equipment.  The computer equipment
was allegedly supplied on 16 June 1994.  The
initial term of the rental was 36 months.  The fixed monthly rental was $792.
The initial
period of rental expired on 16 June 1997.
<P>

5  	Clause 8 of the terms and condition of the rental agreement
stated:
<P>

<b>"RENEWAL.  After the expiration of the initial Term, this Agreement shall be
automatically renewed pending one of the following events:-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	Owner receives Renters written notice of cancellation ninety (90) days
prior to the expiration of the Terms of this Agreement.
 In the event the rent
payments shown above shall be due and payable in accordance with paragraph
seven (7) up to the effective date
of cancellation being the rent due date on
or after the expiry of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt by the Owner
of such
notice of cancellation.  The Renter shall return the Equipment on or
before such effective date of cancellation in accordance with
paragraph twelve
(12).</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	Owner does not receive from the Renter any written notice of
cancellation ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Terms
of this
Agreement or Renter does not return Equipment in accordance with paragraph
twelve (12) by the effective date of cancellation
associated with valid notice
of cancellation as provided for in paragraph eight (a) (8a).  In either of
these events the Term of
this Agreement shall immediately be renewed for a
period equal to the lesser of the Initial Term of twelve (12) months.  The
provisions
of this paragraph eight (8) shall also apply after the expiration of
each such period of renewal."</b>
<P>

6  	Prior to 13 June 1997 the renter of the equipment did not give to
the lessor any notices in respect of the rental agreement
nor did it return the
goods to the lessor.
<P>

7  	The second defendant continued making rental payments after 13
June 1997.  Once again prior to 13 June 1998 the renter of the
equipment did
not give to the lessor any notices in respect of the rental agreement nor did
it return the goods to the lessor.
<P>

8  	On 10 November 1998 the second defendant lodged a claim form with
the Consumer Claims Tribunal.  The second defendant gave the
following details
of the claim:
<P>

<b>"(1)	I am retiring and winding up my company.  I contacted Portfolio Leasing
on 13.5.1998 to establish a payout figure on the computer
that had been on a 36
month rental lease from 16.6.1994.  They advised the sum of $4454 was the
purchase price.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	On 14.6.1998 I posted a cheque for the above amount.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	On 19.10.1998 my cheque was returned and I was informed that it reached
Portfolio Leasing after 16 June and that I therefore was
liable for a further
payment of $792 per month (total $14030).</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	I advised them that I was not responsible for postal delays and
re-offered my cheque for $4454 plus interest of $94.81.</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	They refused my offer and requested payment of $9206 to complete the
transaction.</b>
<P>

<b>(6)	I feel this unfair as my account has been paid by bank debit for 48
months without fail during this contract.  I am prepared to
accept a decision
by the Consumer Claims Tribunal on his matter and would pay the $4454 +
interest to Portfolio Leasing Ltd."</b>
<P>

9  	Thus the amount in dispute is about $4,752 plus interest.  The
matter was heard on 4 December 1998 and 4 March 1999.  Mon 13
May 1999 the
Referee Mr G J Durie gave brief reasons for ruling on jurisdiction.  The
Referee commented that he was referred to an
unreported decision of Sully J but
it was not supplied to him by the parties, although they were requested to do
so.  I have also
been unable to locate that unreported decision.  The relevant
portions of the Referee's reasons are as follows:
<P>

<b>"The claim arises out of a lease of office equipment, the lessor being the
Respondent and the lessee the Claimant.  The original documentation
between the
parties dated 16 June 1994.  That place was for a term of 36 months, with fixed
monthly payments of $792.00.  There is
no holding over clause in the lease.
Clause 8 is relevant.  That provides for an automatic renewal until either (a)
the lessee in
writing cancels the lease;  or (b) where there is no such written
notice, and the equipment is not returned, "the Term of this Agreement
shall
immediately they (sic) renewed for a period equal to the lesser of the Initial
Term or twelve month".  Thus the Initial Term
expired on 15 June 1997.  The
Claimant continued to pay the monthly rental.</b>
<P>

<b>The Respondent argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because the
supply occurred more than three years before the claim was
lodged.  There is no
dispute that claim was not lodged on 10 November 1998...."</b>
<P>

<b>In my opinion, there was a supply of goods, and a provision of services on
16 June 1994.  I consider the proper interpretation of
the agreement entered
into that day was that that supply and provision came to an end on 15 June
1997.  There was then a fresh supply
and provision on 16 June 1997.  I am drawn
to this </b>
<P>

<b>conclusion from the use of the word "renewed" in clause 8 of the agreement.
This is to the contrast and with the use of such words
as "continued or "held
over".  Had such words been used, I would have concluded that there was only
one agreement.</b>
<P>

<b>The Claimant argues that there was a fresh agreement entered into on 16 June
1998 and a fresh supply the (sic) day.  I consider this
argument to be correct
for the same reason that I consider that there was a fresh agreement and a
fresh supply on 16 June 1997.</b>
<P>

<b>I adjourn the matter to take the fixed (sic) by the Registrar at least 14
days ahead as required by the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</i> section 26
(3).</b>
<P>

<b>Ruling</b>
<P>

<b>I rule that the Consumer Claims Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and
determine this claim."</b>
<P>

10  	On 1 March 1999 the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</b> 1987
was repealed by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act</a></b> 1998.  The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims
Act</a></b> 1998 commenced on 1 March 1999.  By virtue of Schedule 1 to the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act</a></b> 1998, the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</b> 1987
applied to matters that had not been finally determined by the Consumer Claims
Tribunal.
<P>

11  	Section 10(1) of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</b> 1987
reads as follows:
<P>

<b>"Jurisdiction</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Subject to this Act, a tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine
any consumer claim referred to it in accordance with this
Act."</b>
<P>

12  	and Section 10(3):
<P>

<b>"(3)	A tribunal does not have jurisdiction in respect of a consumer claim
... if:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	in the case of a consumer claim relating to goods or services that have
been supplied to or for the claimant , the date on which
the supply was made
or, if made in instalments, the date on which the supply was last made;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	...</b>
<P>

<b>or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	in the case of a consumer claim relating to:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	a contract for the supply of goods or services to which neither
paragraph (a) or (b) applies, or</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	a collateral contract, the date on which the contract was entered into,
</b>
<P>

<b>was more than 3 years before the date on which the claim was lodged in
accordance with section 13 of this Act or section 13 of the
 repealed
Act..."</b>
<P>

13  	There was no suggestion that the supply of the computer
equipment was made in instalments. 
<P>

14  	The plaintiff submitted at the hearing before the Referee, that
he had no jurisdiction because the goods, the subject of the
rental agreement,
had been supplied to Stedman on the date of the agreement (16 June 1994) and
that that date was more than three
years before the date on which the claim was
lodged on 10 November 1998. - Section 10(3)(a).  Alternatively if s 10(3)(a)
did not
apply, then the claim was still out of time by virtue of s 10(3)(c) as
the claim was lodged more than three years after the date
on which the contract
was entered into.
<P>

15  	The plaintiff submitted that the Referee was led into error by
equating the concept of date of supply (a question of fact)
with the notion
that there was automatic renewal of the rental agreement on 15 June 1997 (and
again on 15 June 1998).  According
to the plaintiff the Referee erred in law
when he decided that when the parties entered into a fresh agreement there was
then a fresh
supply of the goods.  According to the plaintiff the correct
construction of the agreement is that the application of clause 8 does
not
result in the extinguishment of the original agreement and the creation of a
new one, but merely results in a variation of the
original agreement such that
its provisions apply for a further 12 months.  
<P>

16  	The second defendant made lengthy written submissions.  Some of
these submissions referred to a subsequent oral agreement.
 There is no
evidence that this issue was raised before the Referee and there is no mention
in the Referee's reasons to lead me to
conclude it was raised before him.  In
any event, it seems that the Referee, having decided he had jurisdiction
intended to conduct
a hearing at which these arguments could be ventilated.

<P>

17  	The Referee considered that there was a fresh agreement entered
into on 16 June 1998 and a fresh supply on that day.  Similarly
he held that
there was a fresh agreement on 16 July and a fresh supply on that day.  Section
10 is directed at the date on which
the supply was made.  Section (3) of the
Act defines supply as:
<P>

<b>"(a)	in relation to goods, includes supply of goods by way of a contract for
the sales, exchange, lease, hire hire-purchase of goods
or an alleged contract
for the sales, exchange, lease, hire or hire-purchase of goods, and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	in relation to services, includes provide, grant or render services for
valuable consideration under a contract or for valuable
consideration claimed
to have been agreed to under an alleged contract."</b>
<P>

18  	The second defendant submitted that "supply" can be continuous
so that the computer equipment was not supplied on a specific
date.  The
<b>Macquarie Dictionary</b> 3rd Ed, The Macquarie Library Pty Limited 1997
relevantly defines "supply" as "to furnish (a person, establishment, place,
etc.)
with what is lacking or requisite;  to furnish or provide (something
wanting or requisite):  <i>to</i> <i>supply electricity to a community</i>;  to
make up (deficiency);  make up for (a loss, lack, absence, etc);  satisfy (a
need, demand etc);  to fill (a place, vacancy,
etc);  occupy as a substitute;
to fill the place of another, temporarily, or as a substitute".  The <b>Oxford
Concise Dictionary</b> defines "supply" as "furnish, provide (thing needed, or
person) with or with thing needed".
<P>

19  	The physical supply of computer equipment occurred on one
occasion, namely on 16 June 1994.  Even if the word "supply" could
be construed
as occurring continuously, it could not be construed in this manner with the
supply of inanimate objects such as computer
equipment.
<P>

20  	Clause 8 uses the words "This Agreement shall be automatically
renewed".  It is my view that the application of clause 8 does
not result in
the extinguishment of the original one and the creation of a "fresh" agreement
in identical terms to the original one
but rather gives rise to a variation of
the original agreement so that its provisions apply for a further 12 months.
Clause 8 operates,
in effect as a holding over clause in a lease.  Clause 8
does not result in the making of a new agreement between the renter and
the
lessor.  That being so, the supply of the goods occurred on 16 June 1994 which
was more than three years before 10 November 1998.
 Hence this consumer claim
does not fall within the provision of s 10(3)(a).  Alternatively if s 10(3)(a)
does not apply, the contract
was entered into on 15 June 1994 which was more
than three years prior to 10 November 1998.  The consumer claim does not fall
within
s 10(3)(c)(i).  Accordingly the tribunal does not have jurisdiction in
relation to this consumer claim.  This is common ground between
the parties.
<P>

21  	It is my view that the learned Referee has erred in law by
finding that there were fresh supply and provision of computer equipment
on 15
June 1997 and on 16 July 1997.  I set aside the decision of Referee G J Durie
made on 13 May 1999.  I make a declaration that
the Consumer Claims Tribunal
has no jurisdiction to determine the claim made by the second defendant against
the plaintiff in proceedings
No TSY98/1534.  Costs should follow the event.
The second defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

22  	<b>The Court declares that</b>:
<P>

(1)	The Consumer Claim Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the claim made
by the second defendant against the plaintiff in
proceedings No TSY98/1534.

<P>

23  	<b>The Court orders that</b>:
<P>

(2)	The decision of Referee G J Durie made on 13 May 1999 be set aside.
<P>

(3)	The second defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
