<b>3588/94	GIOVANNI OLIVERI v MICHAEL G. JONES &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The first defendant and cross-claimant, Michael
Jones, who is trustee of the bankrupt estate of Dominic Laurence
Oliveri, has
appealed from the certificate of Master Macready of 21 May 1999.  On 18
December 1996 I made orders declaring the interests
of parties in three
properties, and orders for taking accounts of dealings by the cross-defendants
with the Petersham property and
for an inquiry as to the amount of damage
suffered by Mr Jones by reason of the conduct of the cross-defendants in
dealing with the
Petersham property, subsequent to the sequestration order.
After hearing the accounts and inquiry the learned Master certified that
two of
the cross-defendants Giovanni Oliveri and Emanueli Oliveri were liable to pay
Mr Jones $368.52 and interest of $104.55 a total
of $473.01 in respect of
dealings with the property, and that no sum was due in respect of damages.  The
Master gave reasons on 5
March 1999 and 7 May 1999.  
<P>

2  	The first ground of appeal contended that it was erroneous to
hold that the appellant was not entitled to damages for occupation
of Flat 1 at
57 Station Street from the Sequestration Order on 23 December 1993 until Mr
Jones recovered possession on 3 February
1997.  The claim for damages before
the Master was a claim for mesne profits.  When Mr Jones' entitlement to the
property arose Emanueli
Oliveri was in occupation of Unit 1 as his residence
and he had the practical management of all four units in the building at
Petersham;
he did not have any leasehold interest, and he was in occupation
with the permission or at least at the sufferance of Dominic Oliveri.
 The
registered proprietors were Dominic Oliveri and Joseph Oliveri, but Joseph
Oliveri was not a beneficial owner.  The position
taken by Giovanni Oliveri and
the explanation offered by Emanueli Oliveri was to the effect that Emanueli
Oliveri acted at the direction
of Giovanni Oliveri who, as my earlier decision
established, had no beneficial interest in the property.  At the time of the
Sequestration
Order Emanueli's occupation was lawful, as he had the permission
of the beneficial owner.  Mr Jones did not in the cross-claim or
in any other
way bring proceedings in ejectment against Emanueli Oliveri, and did not make
any demand for possession, re-entry or
attempt to re-enter.  On one occasion he
asked for access for the purpose of inspection, which was refused, but to do so
was not
to effect a re-entry or attempt one.  Possession was eventually yielded
voluntarily on or about 3 February 1997.
<P>

3  	The acts of Emanueli Oliveri, and of Giovanni Oliveri at whose
direction (and it was claimed by both, and not disputed, that
he acted at his
direction) can only be said to be trespass by resort to a legal fiction.  Mr
Emanueli Oliveri did not establish control
of the premises by an unlawful entry
but he was actually there when Mr Jones' title to the premises arose.  In
actuality he did not
ever become a trespasser by withdrawal of his permission
to be present, by actually re-entering after possession had been taken by
Mr
Jones.  However an owner of land is entitled to recover damages for trespass,
referred to as mesne profits, under a fictitious
doctrine referred to as
trespass by relation, stated by Taylor J. in <b>Minister of State for the
Interior v RT Company Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20107%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 107 CLR 1.</a>  At p5 his Honour
said: "In support of the primary submission ... it was pointed out that a claim
for <i>mesne</i> profits is a particular form of the action for trespass, that
as such it is based upon an injury to the plaintiff's possession and
that the
plaintiff is enabled to recover only upon the doctrine of trespass by relation.
That is to say, that upon entering into
possession the plaintiff is deemed by a
legal fiction to have been in possession ever since his right to possession
arose."  His
Honour went on to show, with references to authority and texts,
that the principle on which the submission were based was clearly
established
and that (p6) "... at common law a plaintiff suing for <i>mesne</i> profits
could not, in general, succeed unless he proved that pursuant to a right to do
so he had entered into possession."  Taylor
J went on to indicate some
exceptions, but the present case did not fall within any exception.  The
best-known exception itself involves
a further fictitious step in that issuing
proceedings claiming ejectment and mesne profits is treated, for the purpose of
the claim
for mesne profits, as itself a re-entry.  Having regard to the form
of the cross-claim that reasoning and the fiction which it involves
are not
available in these proceedings.  
<P>

4  	Some expressions in Taylor J's judgment show that his Honour did
not regard the law in this area as altogether satisfactory
(and in my view it
could not be regarded as satisfactory), but however that may be the law is well
established, and it is only an
owner who has taken possession of the property,
or has taken some step which is treated as its equivalent such as commencing
ejectment
proceedings, who has the benefit of a claim for damages for mesne
profits relating back to the time when the owner's title accrued.
<P>

5  	The unusual facts of <b>The Minister of State for the Interior v.
RT Co. Pty Ltd</b> led Taylor J to a conclusion in which the plaintiff's claim
for mesne profits was defeated on the ground that the writ was issued
and the
claim for damages was made before re-entry was effected; hence there was no
entitlement to damages at the time of commencement
of the proceedings; while
the unusual facts of that case meant that fictitious relation back was not
available.  
<P>

6  	In the present case not only was the cross-claim claiming damages
commenced before possession was taken by Mr Jones, and without
commencing
ejectment proceedings with a claim for mesne profits, which would have given Mr
Jones the advantage the second fiction
to which I have referred; the order for
the assessment of damages was made before possession was taken.  At the time
the cross-claim
was commenced and at the time of my order a claim for damage
for mesne profits was not maintainable; cf the reasoning of Taylor J
at 7.  See
too <b>Baldry v Jackson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20NSWLR%20415" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 2 NSWLR 415.</a>  The procedural effects of this
shortcoming and the law as established in <b>Baldry v Jackson</b> might have
been overcome by an amendment granted under Pt.20 r.1(1) of the Supreme Court
Rules, with the effect prescribed by subr.(3A),
but there has been no
application for an amendment of that kind.  In my view the Master's reasons,
which are found at paras 23 to
25 of his judgment of 5 March 1999, were
correct.  
<P>

7  	Counsel's submissions in support of this ground went little
further than to contend that the outcome appears very anomalous
as Emanueli
Oliveri remained in occupation and control for well over three years after the
Sequestration Order, resisted these proceedings
and in probability would not
have given up possession had it been demanded, particularly having regard to
his response to the request
for access.  The submissions did not come to terms
with the reality that the law has been established as the Master applied it.
<P>

8  	Counsel also contended that the Master should have taken the view
that an award of damages was available as an alternative to
the grant of an
injunction restrained continuing trespass.  The Master's reasons for not acting
on this basis were to the effect
that there was no basis on which an injunction
to restrain continuing trespass could be granted, and in my view this holding
was
clearly correct.  Mr Jones' right to possession could have been enforced by
ejectment proceedings, and having regard to the facts
there was no basis on
which an equitable remedy could be granted.  In any event, there was no claim
for an equitable remedy relating
to possession of the premises.
<P>

9  	In my opinion the Master's certificate relating to damages was
correct.
<P>

10  	The other ground of appeal related to the taking of accounts.
The principal matter charged on the respondents was the rent
received by
Emanueli Oliveri with the authority of Giovanni Oliveri from Units 2, 3 and 4,
which were let out at most times while
Emanueli Oliveri was in control of the
premises.  In taking the account the Master made allowances for moneys paid by
Emanueli Oliveri
relating to the premises, and for other matters, and in so
doing allowed mortgage repayments which had been made against a bank mortgage
charged on the property.  The contention was to the effect that one-quarter of
the mortgage repayments should not have been allowed
as a just allowance,
having regard to Emanueli Oliveri's occupation of Unit 1.  The Master's reasons
for not reducing the allowance
in this way are found at para.5 of his judgment
of 7 May 1999.  The Master found in fact that there was no agreement between
these
respondents regulating a quarter of the mortgage payments (and that
finding is not challenged), and otherwise disposed of the point
by saying "...
the trustee has benefited from the payment of the mortgage.  On sale he has to
pay less to discharge the mortgage."
 In my opinion that was a complete and
correct dealing with the subject.  Although the respondents are accountable for
the rents
which Emanueli Oliveri collected, fairness requires that they be
allowed money paid, while receiving those rents, in reduction of
a mortgage
debt over the property.  The fact that he lived in part of the property makes
no difference to this; it is no less true
that Mr Jones has the advantage of
reduction of the debt.  The argument is an oblique way of seeking to charge the
respondents with
a small part of the claim for damages for mesne profits for
occupying Unit 1.  I do not regard it as appropriate to give that partial
and
limited recognition to the mesne profits claim at an altogether different part
of the parties' controversy.  In my view this
part of the Master's decision was
correct.
<P>

11  	During argument I considered the possibility that the just
allowance to be made might be limited to the reduction in principal,
and not to
mortgage interest for the period during which Emanueli Oliveri was in
occupation.  However the evidence does not lay the
ground for establishing what
the interest was, no such point was taken before the Master or in the Notice of
Appeal, the materials
on which the point could be decided are not before me,
and it is not appropriate to resolve that question in the appeal.  In my
opinion
the appeal from the Master's decision should be dismissed.
<P>

12  	Mr Jones' counsel also brought before me further consideration
of the costs of the inquiry, which I reserved in my orders of
13 December 1996.
I then said "My present impression is that if any significant sum is found to
be payable to the first defendant
in the course of that inquiry the first
defendant should recover all costs of the inquiry, but that cannot be decided
now as some
further circumstances might emerge in the course of the inquiry."
The amount recovered is not an amount which should in ordinary
circumstances
bring with it an order for costs.  The provisions of Rules of  Court
establishing scales do not literally apply in
the Equity Division although they
are sometimes applied by analogy.  There are some unusual circumstances in this
case, as the inquiry
was ancillary to litigation relating to property of
significant value which could only be brought in the Supreme Court.  Further,
the respondents did not participate in an appropriate way in the Inquiry so as
to produce accounts of their dealings and give effect
to my direction that
there be an inquiry on a subject in relation to which, for practical purposes,
almost all information was in
the hands of the respondents and not of Mr Jones.
I was referred to several affidavits and pieces of correspondence which
contain,
in no systematic way, indications of what might be in accounts.  These
served only to illustrate that the respondents did not produce
accounts in any
intelligible form.  The respondents took their position as an accounting party
in no way seriously until the hearing
of the inquiry was approaching.  On 30
October 1998 Master Macready made a number of procedural directions including
one requiring
Emanueli Oliveri to file a statement setting out his best
accounting showing the amount received, expenses paid and any credits given
to
tenants.  Thereafter Emanueli Oliveri made and filed an affidavit of 23
November 1998 in which, without complying with the court's
practices relating
to accounts, and in an inadequately systematic manner, he set out accounts
which formed the basis of the hearing
before the Master.  The cross-claimant
responded with a document indicating the matters in dispute which became
Exhibit 1.  Emanueli
Oliveri's affidavit was extremely belated, in an inquiry
which was directed on 13 December 1996 where the hearing was to commence
on 1
December 1998.  
<P>

13  	It is unlikely that Emanueli Oliveri would ever have made any
accounting at all unless Mr Jones had pressed on with the inquiry
and obtained
the procedural directions, and it was only when he made this affidavit that Mr
Jones and those advising him were in
a position to address what was truly in
issue and the likely outcome in any realistic way.  The events demonstrate that
Emanueli
Oliveri has followed a course of protraction and failure to comply
with the obvious requirements of his position as an accounting
party until the
last minute; he exploited the Court's procedure.  To my mind this is a
justification, at least to some extent, of
the course taken by Mr Jones in
pressing on with the inquiry, and is a consideration of weight in favour of
allowing some costs notwithstanding
the no more than nominal success of the
exercise.  In my opinion the events show that it was necessary to attain
justice that Mr
Jones should, with legal advisers, continue proceedings in the
inquiry, compel Emanueli Oliveri to give his version of the accounts,
and then
come to some conclusion on them.  Giovanni Oliveri is in no better situation as
he did not ever file any evidence at all
or make any gesture towards accounting
for what had been done under his authority.
<P>

14  	On the other hand some aspects of the conduct of the inquiry
appear to me to have been excessive.  The hearing continued for
three days and
Mr Jones was represented by senior and junior counsel.  In both these respects
the costs exceed any costs which respondents
ought justly be required to
pay.
<P>

15  	In the circumstances I propose to make an order for costs, but
to limit costs to be recovered in several ways.
<P>

16  	My Order is:
<P>

(1)	On the Notice of Appeal dated 9 June 1999 order that that the Appeal be
dismissed with costs.
<P>

(2)	On the further consideration of the costs of the proceedings on the Inquiry
reserved by my Order of 13 December 1996:
<P>

(1)	Order that the cross-defendants Emanueli Oliveri and Giovanni Oliveri pay
the cross-claimant's costs of the Inquiry assessed
in accordance with this
order.
<P>

(2)	On the assessment of costs the cost of preparation for the hearing and of
procedural directions and of hearing the proceedings
on 1 December 1998 are to
be allowed, but the costs of hearing the proceedings after 1 December 1998 and
the costs of senior counsel
are not to be allowed.
<P>

(3)	Order that the cross-defendants Emanueli Oliveri and Giovanni Oliveri pay
the cross-claimant's costs of the application relating
to costs of 2 August
1999.
