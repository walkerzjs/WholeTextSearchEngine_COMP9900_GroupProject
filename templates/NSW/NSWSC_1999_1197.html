<b>JUDGMENT (<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> - contextual imputations
- re-consideration of judgment 20 August 1999 (NSWSC 838))</b>
<P>

1   	On 20 August 1999 (NSWSC 838: DLJ: 3) I delivered a ruling
in relation to then pleaded defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a></i>.
<P>

2   	The ruling was delivered in the context of an application
concerning, <i>inter alia,</i> the adequacy of particulars of justification and
comment.  It was contended for the plaintiff that the form of the Defence then
pleaded
by the defendant (see paragraph 43 of the judgment) did not plead an
available defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the Act because it "<i>pleaded back"</i> the
plaintiff's imputations.  The relevant part of my judgment set out in
paragraphs 45 to 49 as follows:
<P>

<i>It seems to me that this submission is well founded.  The structure of the
defence provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> has been considered by the Court of Appeal in
<b>Perkins v Harris</b> (26 May 1995);  <b>Waterhouse &amp; Anor v Hickie</b>
(26 May  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%29%201995%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995) (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-347</a>; and, <b>TCN Channel Pty Limited
v Antoniadis</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 682.</a>  I considered the matter in <b>Hall &amp;
Anor v Nationwide News Pty Limited </b>(5 November 1998, unreported (DLJ: 2)).
</i>
<P>

<i>Contextual imputations are imputations not pleaded by the plaintiff.  They
are imputations that are not "imputation(s) complained
of" by the plaintiff.
They are "other" imputations.</i>
<P>

<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 15</a> provides the defence of truth in relation to imputations
"complained of" by the plaintiff.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> provides a defence whereby a
defendant can plead "other" imputations than those "complained of" by the
plaintiff which arise at the
same time and in addition to those "complained of"
by the plaintiff and provided they differ in substance from those pleaded by
the
plaintiff. </i>
<P>

<i>Where a defendant justifies some but not all of the imputations "complained
of" by the plaintiff (that is, justifies pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15)</a> I do not see any
statutory basis for the use by the defendant of "unjustified" imputations
"complained of" by the plaintiff as "contextual
imputations".  It might be
considered that this position is heretical and contrary to the observations of
Hunt J in <b>Allen v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited </b>(2 December 1988,
unreported) expressly said to be correct by Priestley JA in <b>Perkins v
Harris</b> at 9-10.</i>
<P>

<i>In the absence of any "other" imputations being relied by the defendant
strictly in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> as contextual imputations, the defendant can
still plead truth to the plaintiff's "</i>complained of"<i> imputations or some
of them and as to the balance in respect of which there is no plea of
justification pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a>, rely upon the truth of the "</i>complained
of"<i> imputations in mitigation of damages.  In other words, the ultimate
objective sought to be attained by the use of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> can be attained in
mitigation of damages when the only defence is in fact a defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15.</a>
It is open to the defendant to argue that by reason of the truth being
established of imputations 1, 2 and 3 the damages to the plaintiff's
reputation
in respect of the unproved imputation 4 and 5 is zero.  No damage to the
plaintiff's reputation has in fact been proved
by reason of the truth of
imputations 1, 2 and 3 and indeed the case is such that any presumption of
damage arising from unproved
imputations 3 and 4 has been rebutted.</i>
<P>

3   	The defendant has sought leave of the Court of Appeal to
appeal so much of my judgment of 20 August 1999 as is set out above
and I
understand that that Court's dealing with the application has been stood
over.
<P>

4   	On 14 October 1999 the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion
seeking various forms of relief in relation to the particulars of
justification
and comment thitherto and on 24 November ([1999] NSWSC 1132:  DLJ: 4) I dealt
with the then outstanding matter of the
sufficiency of particulars.  It was in
the course of the argument in connection with the matters the subject of the
Notice of Motion
that the correctness of my decision of 20 August was
re-argued.  It was re-argued by leave and, in effect, at my suggestion.  As
explained to the parties it was my anticipation that in concurrent but
unrelated litigation (<b><i>Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty
Limited</i></b>) an occasion would arise for me to re-consider my decision in
this matter.  That occasion did not eventuate and thus my suggestion
that it
might be opportune to re-argue it in this litigation itself if costs of an
appeal to the Court of Appeal could be avoided
and time spent in that Court
eliminated.  
<P>

5   	For the purposes of the conduct of the re-consideration of
the issues the subject of my earlier judgment I have had the benefit
of the
submissions in writing provided by the parties to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

6   	Having considered the matters raised orally and in writing
by way of submission in re-argument I have come to the conclusion
that my
decision of 20 August 1999 is wrong.
<P>

7   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 15</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> (truth)
provides as follows:
<P>

<i>"(1)	Notwithstanding <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a>, the truth of any imputation complained of
is not a defence as to that imputation except as mentioned in this
section.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	It is a defence as to any imputation complained of that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the imputation is a matter of substantial truth, and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the imputation either relates to a matter of public interest or is
published under qualified privilege".</i>
<P>

8   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> (contextual truth) provides as follows:
<P>

<i>"(1)	Where an imputation complained of is made by the publication of any
report, article, letter, note, picture, oral utterance or
other thing and
another imputation is made by the same publication, the latter imputation is,
for the purposes of this section, contextual
to the imputation complained
of.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	It is a defence to any imputation complained of that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the imputation relates to a matter of public interest or is published
under qualified privilege,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	one or more imputations contextual to the imputation complained
of:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	relate to a matter of public interest or are published under qualified
privilege, and</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	are matters of substantial truth, and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	by reason that those contextual imputations are matters of substantial
truth, the imputation complained of does not further injure
the reputation of
the plaintiff".</i>
<P>

9   	As matter of construction I am persuaded on reading the
terms of the two sections that the expression "<i>another imputation</i>" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
16(1)</a> is <i>not</i> limited to an imputation <i>not</i> pleaded by the
plaintiff.  The only limitation as to the proper meaning of that phrase arises
from the concept that a defendant cannot
plead back by way of a contextual
imputation the plaintiff's pleaded imputation as a defence to that pleaded
imputation.  This is
clear from the judgment of Priestley JA in
<b><i>Waterhouse &amp; Anor v Hickie</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2c347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) Aust Torts R 81,347.</a> 
<P>

10   	Insofar as in the course of my earlier judgment I
described my approach as "<i>heretical</i>" it certainly was, and the more so,
as it was contrary to his Honour's reasoning leading, in my view, to the
judgment of that Court
(that is, it was not <i>obiter</i>), at 62,490 - 62,491.

<P>

11   	That a defendant cannot plead back as a contextual
imputation an imputation pleaded by the plaintiff is made clear by the
terms of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> itself when it isolates the "<i>imputation complained of"</i>, that is,
one pleaded by the plaintiff, as the cause of action to which the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> defence
can be applied.  In other words, a defendant can plead back an imputation
complained of by the plaintiff but not as a defence
to that imputation.  A
defendant can plead back an imputation complained of by the plaintiff as a
contextual imputation which by
itself or in combination with others can be
weighed against other imputations, (but not the imputation complained of),
pleaded by
the plaintiff.  
<P>

12   	In the principal cases dealt with by the Court of Appeal
on the subject of contextual imputations that Court has been concerned
with
cases where the defendant has pleaded imputations not pleaded by the plaintiff:
<b><i>Perkins v Harris</i></b>; <b><i>Waterhouse &amp; Anor v Hickie</i></b>;
<b><i>TCN Channel Pty Limited v Antoniadis</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 682.</a>  I do
not consider it to be open to distinguish those cases on that basis.  
<P>

13   	The issue is not a bare one of what the plaintiff has
pleaded.  The question is not resolved by considering such issues as
to whether
the plaintiff has pleaded "<i>all available imputations"</i>.  The matters of
construction apply, in my view, whether the defendant has pleaded additional
imputations as contextual imputations
or, relies only upon the plaintiff's
imputations for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16.</a>
<P>

14   	In <b><i>Allen v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty
Limited</i></b> (unreported, 2 December 1988) Hunt J said at pages 10-11:
<P>

<i>"A defendant is always entitled to adopt any of the plaintiff's imputations
as a contextual imputation and to plead a defence of contextual
truth based
upon that imputation to the cause of action based upon another of the
plaintiff's imputations.  Similarly, the defendant
is always entitled to adopt
any of the plaintiff's imputations as one or more of its group of contextual
imputations where it relies
upon the combined effect of the truth of that group
of imputations as so affecting the plaintiff's reputation that the plaintiff's
imputation to which that group of contextual imputations is pleaded did not
further injure that reputation".</i>
<P>

15   	This was expressly said to be correct by Priestley JA in
<b><i>Perkins v Harris</i></b>.  Whilst it is not, to me, clear why his Honour
came to this view, an examination of the rationale of the defence of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> does
provide the relevant reasoning.  This rationale was discussed by Priestley JA
in <b><i>Waterhouse v Hickie</i></b> by reference to the report of the Law
Reform Commission (LRC 11 (1971)) especially paragraphs 73 and 74.  
<P>

16   	What the Law Reform Commission said is:
<P>

<i>"73.	Suppose that the defendant has published an imputation that the
plaintiff has been convicted of simple larceny and an imputation
that the
plaintiff has been convicted of fraudulently converting trust property to his
own use.  Suppose that the first imputation
is false but the second is true.
If the plaintiff sues for damages for defamation in respect of both imputations
a defence of truth
will fail because the truth of both charges cannot be
proved.  In England the effect of the Defamation Act 1952, section 5, is that
in such a case a defence of truth will succeed if the first imputation did not
materially injure the plaintiffs reputation having
regard to the truth of the
second imputation.  We agree with the object of this section, as far as it
goes.</i>
<P>

<i>74.	But if on facts such as these the plaintiff sues only in respect of the
first imputation he will still succeed notwithstanding
a provision along the
lines of section 5 of the English Act of 1952: <b>Plato Films Ltd v Speidel</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1090).</a>  A Bill (the Freedom of Publication Protection Bill) was
introduced in Parliament at Westminster in 1966 with a view, amongst other
things, to substitute a new section for section 5 of the 1952 Act.  The new
section would have embraced the case where the plaintiff
sues on such
imputations only as cannot be proved to be true.  We agree also with the object
of this proposed substitution.  Section
16 is intended to carry this object
into effect.  Its expression has to be more elaborate than that of the English
proposals because
place must be given to questions of public interest and
qualified privilege.  The Freedom of Publication Protection Bill was not
passed: this was, we believe, because of the controversial nature of other
provisions of the Bill."</i>
<P>

17   	Shortly stated, the objective of s 16 was to provide the
defendant with an opportunity to obtain judgment in its favour in
circumstances
where a plaintiff has pleaded more than one imputation, or the defendant can
plead contextual imputations, but in respect
of the plaintiff's imputations not
all those complained of by the plaintiff can be proved to be true.  
<P>

18   	Section 5 of the United Kingdom legislation provided:
"<i>In an action for libel or slander in respect of words containing two or
more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of
justification shall
not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the
words not proved to be true do not
materially injure the plaintiff's reputation
having regard to the truth of the remaining charges"</i>.  When one takes into
account the wording of the then provision of the United Kingdom Act it can be
seen why the Commissioners took
the view that they did in paragraphs 73 and 74
of their Report.  The more so in the context of the imputation constituting the
cause
of action to which the defence is pleaded.  
<P>

19   	I do not see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> to be
relevant.  That section is concerned with damages and the elimination of any
presumption as to falsity.  It provides that evidence
of the substantial  truth
of an imputation may be lead on the question of damages where it is relevant.
The plaintiff in a defamation
action in New South Wales is awarded damages for
<i>"relevant harm</i>" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 46).</a>  
<P>

20   	A defendant is entitled to lead evidence of the truth of
an imputation pleaded by the plaintiff (and only an imputation pleaded
by the
plaintiff) in mitigation of damages.  In what circumstances?  When the
defendant cannot prove a defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> by reason of a defendant
being unable to prove that the imputation related to a matter of public
interest or was published under
qualified privilege.  There is no inconsistency
between the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> and the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a>.  There may be
practical problems that confront a trial judge in any remaining case where that
trial judge has to sum up to the jury
on such issues: that is merely the
product of the legislation.  It can be overcome in any given trial.  When the
operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> is properly understood, especially that consideration which
limits it, as it must be limited, to the substantial truth of an imputation
complained of by a plaintiff, any asserted tension between that section and the
justification sections does not exist.  
<P>

21   	For these reason I am of the view that Order 4 made on 20
August 1999 striking out paragraph 8 of the Defence to the Amended
Statement of
Claim should not have been made and I revoke that Order to the extent that the
reasoning founding it is in error, as-it-were,
and to that extent withdraw the
earlier judgment.
<P>

22   	The question of costs is not easy of resolution.  The
plaintiff succeeded substantially on the Motion leading to the judgment
of 20
August 1999.  It appears from the plaintiff/opponent's submissions to the Court
of Appeal that he does not contend that a "<i>defendant who pleads a contextual
imputation cannot rely upon the truth of one or more of the plaintiff's
imputations</i>" (page 5) which is not quite consistent with what I ultimately
and incorrectly held to be the position in my judgment of 20 August.
 The order
for costs I would <i>propose</i> therefore in relation to proceedings leading
to the judgment of 20 August 1999 is that the defendant will pay two-thirds of
the plaintiff's
costs.  As to the remaining one-third of the costs, each party
should either bear its own costs and have the benefit of a certificate
under
the <i>Suitor's Fund</i> if eligible or alternatively, that those costs be
costs in the cause.
<P>

23   	As to the proceedings leading to this judgment I am of the
view that costs should be costs in the cause.  These are <i>not</i> final
orders and I will hear counsel further on them.
<P>

24   	The formal order I make in this instance is that Order 4
made on 20 August 1999 is revoked.
