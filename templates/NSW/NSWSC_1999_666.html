<u>10609/1999</u>	<u>JOHN PAUL MELO v AILEEN COULTER</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 16 March
1999.  Whilst the Summons in fact claims relief pursuant to both
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 208L</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">208M</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act), the hearing of the
Summons proceeded on the basis that relief was being sought only under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
208L.</a>
<P>

2  	In support of the Summons, the plaintiff has relied on two
affidavits sworn by Katerina Muc (the solicitor for the plaintiff)
and certain
exhibits.  In opposing the relief claimed, the defendant relied on affidavits
sworn by Mr Crestani (the solicitor for
the defendant).
<P>

3  	The plaintiff brought a claim for damages arising out of a
personal injury.  The claim was heard in the District Court before
Acting Judge
Johnstone.  The plaintiff was successful in recovering judgment.  The judgment
and orders made by his Honour may be
found in the affidavit sworn by Mr
Crestani.  For present purposes, the relevant orders are as follows:-
<P>

"6.	Defendant to pay plaintiff's costs on a party/party basis until 14 May 1992
and on an indemnity basis from 14 May 1992.
<P>

7.	Plaintiff to provide defendant with an assessment of costs within 28
days.
<P>

8.	Interest to run on any unpaid costs from 13 May 1998, provided that the
assessment of costs is supplied by 13 April 1998."
<P>

4  	The plaintiff prepared and served a Bill of Costs on the
defendant.  Unfortunately, it was not supplied by 13 April 1998.  The
plaintiff
applied to this Court for assessment of the costs by a Costs Assessor.  The
application was referred to a Costs Assessor
(Mr McGruther).  Documentation
passed between the Costs Assessor and the parties (including a Statement of
Objection to the Bill
of Costs and a Reply to the Statement of Objections).  A
Certificate of Determination was issued on 16 February 1999.
<P>

5  	The certificate awarded costs in the sum of $48,220.96 and
disbursements in the sum of $48,642.00.  This saw a substantial reduction
in
the amount claimed in the bill.  The bill had claimed professional costs in the
order of $87,000.00 (a significant proportion
of which related to indemnity
costs) and disbursements in the order of $55,000.00.
<P>

6  	The Costs Assessor was asked to provide reasons for the
determination.  Reasons were subsequently supplied by him (see Exhibit
KM
8).
<P>

7  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L</a> provides a narrow avenue of appeal (as to a matter
of law arising in proceedings to determine the application).  The plaintiff
bears
the onus of satisfying the Court of an entitlement to the relief provided
by this provision.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff contends that there were two errors of law.
Firstly, it is said that the Costs Assessor misdirected himself and
applied the
wrong test in assessing the costs which were ordered to be payable on an
indemnity basis.  Secondly, it is said that
he erred in failing to include in
his determination a component for interest in accordance with the order made by
his Honour.
<P>

9  	It is convenient to firstly look at the second of the two matters
argued.  In my view, the contention sought to be advanced
by the plaintiff is
hopeless.
<P>

10  	The order for interest was the subject of an express proviso.
The proviso was not met by the plaintiff.  He failed to provide
the defendant
with an assessment of costs within 28 days (by 13 April 1998) and so lost the
benefit of that order.
<P>

11  	Counsel for the plaintiff was unable to identify any source of
power which would enable the Costs Assessor to include a component
for interest
in his determination.  I am not satisfied that the Costs Assessor had any such
power.
<P>

12  	The Act enables the filing of the certificate (s 208JA).  On
filing of the certificate it is taken to be a judgment of the
Court in which it
is filed for the amount of unpaid costs.  Under the relevant statutory
provisions, interest then runs on the amount
of unpaid costs.
<P>

13  	The parties define the issues for determination.  The Bill of
Costs did not contain any claim for interest.  No claim for interest
was made
in the Application for Assessment.  The question of interest was not raised in
either the Statement of Objection or the
Reply (if anything, this material
could have led the Costs Assessor to the belief that the question of interest
had been dealt with
by the Judge).  It was simply not agitated before the Costs
Assessor at all.  In the circumstances of this case, if there had been
any
substance in this argument, I would not have been satisfied that the plaintiff
should be permitted to agitate it in the appeal.
<P>

14  	I now turn to the first of the two contentions.
<P>

15  	The Act stipulates that a Costs Assessor must consider the
matters set forth in s 208A (1) and s 208F (1).  It may be observed
that whilst
the respective considerations have similarity, they are not identical.  He must
comply with the requirements of the other
subsections contained in s 208F
(inter alia he must assess the costs on an indemnity basis where an order for
indemnity costs has
been made and he must have regard to any relevant rules of
the Court that made the order for costs).  These provisions do not stand
in
apparent harmony.  Any internal conflict presents the Costs Assessor with
significant challenge.
<P>

16  	The District Court does have relevant rules.  In substance, the
provisions require that all costs shall be allowed except in
so far as they are
of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred.  Doubts as to
these matters are to be resolved in
favour of the receiving party.
<P>

17  	Whilst there was an abundance of material before him which made
it clear that a part of costs payable had been ordered on an
indemnity basis,
it appears that neither party drew the matter of the content of these
provisions to the attention of the Costs Assessor.
 It was up to the plaintiff
to draw his attention to any relevant rule of Court.
<P>

18  	On behalf of the defendant, it is argued that the relevant rules
merely change the onus from the recipient to the person subject
to the order.
There may be considerable force in that submission (the terminological
differences may not throw up any or any substantial
differences in meaning).
It was not fully argued and it is not necessary to pursue it further for the
purposes of determining this
proceeding.
<P>

19  	The reasons provided by the Costs Assessor contain a Schedule.
It identifies items which were the subject of deduction and
the amount deducted
from each of the items.  It also identifies the categories of reasons relied on
by the Costs Assessor.  The categories
identify provisions contained in
sections 208A and 208F.  Largely, categories 2, 4 and 6 have been relied on by
the Costs Assessor.
 Category 2 is expressed in terms of "Not a fair and
reasonable amount".  Category 4 is expressed in terms of "Not reasonable to
carry out the work or all the work".  Category 6 is expressed in terms of "Work
not carried out in a reasonable manner".  There is
material in the language of
these categories which is consistent with the Costs Assessor having directed
himself to the relevant
principles.  In these circumstances, any lack of
specific reference to a relevant rule to which he is required to have regard
loses
significance.  In any event, I do not consider that the plaintiff should
now be permitted to complain about any such failure.
<P>

20  	In presenting the case for the plaintiff, counsel has largely
rested on the magnitude of the amount disallowed.  This magnitude
is inter alia
consistent with an inflated bill of costs.  It has not been sought to identify
error in respect of any particular amount
that has been disallowed.  In any
event, questions of what is "reasonable" or "unreasonable" are questions of
fact.
<P>

21  	As I have earlier said, the onus of demonstrating an error of
law rests with the plaintiff.  In this case, I am not satisfied
that the onus
has been discharged.
<P>

22  	I dismiss the Summons.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
proceedings.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
