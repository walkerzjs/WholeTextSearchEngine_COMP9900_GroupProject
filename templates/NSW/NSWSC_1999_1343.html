LMW</b></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
(On application for direction that the jury acquit the accused)<p>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>1. HIS HONOUR:  At the end of the Crown case Mr
Zahra made an application that the jury should be directed to acquit the accused
upon
the basis that the Crown had failed to rebut the presumption of doli
incapax.  That application was refused and I now publish my
reasons for such
refusal.</p>
<p><br>2. The accused was only ten years and some three months of age when it is
alleged his acts caused the drowning of the deceased, and
in these circumstances
the Crown must prove, as an element of his case, that when he committed the acts
in question the accused knew
that what he was doing was seriously wrong.</p>
<p><br>3. The relevant principles were stated by Lord Lowry in <i>C v Director
of Public Prosecutions</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%201%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 1 AC 1</a> at 38:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>&#8220;A long and uncontradicted line of authority
makes two propositions clear.  The first is that the prosecution must prove that
the child defendant did the act charged and that when doing that act he knew
that it was a wrong act as distinct from an act of mere
naughtiness or childish
mischief.  The criminal standard of proof applies.  What is required has been
variously expressed, as in
Blackstone, &#8216;strong and clear beyond all doubt
or contradiction&#8217;, or in <i>Rex v Gorrie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2083%20JP%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 83 JP 136</a> &#8216;very
clear and complete evidence&#8217; or in <i>B v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%2044%20Cr%20App%20R%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 44 Cr App R 1</a>, 3
per Lord Parker CJ, &#8216;It has often been put in this way,
that...&#8221;guilty knowledge must be proved and the evidence to
that effect
must be clear and beyond all possibility of doubt.&#8221;&#8217;  No doubt, the
emphatic tone of some of the directions
was due to the court&#8217;s anxiety to
prevent merely naughty children from being convicted of crimes and in a sterner
age to protect
them from the draconian consequences of conviction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second clearly established proposition is that evidence to prove the
defendant&#8217;s guilty knowledge, as defined above, must
not be the mere proof
of the doing of the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong that act
may be.  As Erle J said in
<i>Reg v Smith (Sidney)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281845%29%201%20Cox%20CC%20260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1845) 1 Cox CC 260:</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>&#8216;a guilty knowledge that he was doing wrong - must be proved by the
evidence, and cannot be presumed from the mere commission
of the act.  You are
to determine from a review of the evidence whether it is satisfactorily proved
that at the time he fired the
rick (if you should be of opinion he did fire it)
he had a guilty knowledge that he was committing a crime.&#8217;&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>4. The above dicta have been much cited and applied in the courts since: 
see, for example, <i>A v Director of Public Prosecutions</i> (1997) 1 Cr App R
27; <i>CC v Director of Public Prosecutions</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%201%20Cr%20App%20R%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 1 Cr App R 375</a>; <i>L v
Director of Public Prosecutions</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%202%20Cr%20App%20R%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 2 Cr App R 501</a>; <i>Re F (a child)</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20101%20A%20Crim%20R%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 101 A Crim R 113</a>; <i>DK v Rooney &amp; Anor</i> (unreported, McInerney J,
3 July 1996) and <i>R v CRH </i>(unreported, NSWCCA, 18 December 1996).</p>
<p><br>5. How is the presumption to be rebutted?  It cannot be rebutted merely
by reference to the essential elements of the offence:  see
the dicta of Lord
Lowry cited above.  In <i>C </i>per Lord Lowry said at 39:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;The cases seem to show, logically enough, that the older the defendant is
and the more obviously wrong the act, the easier
it will generally be to prove
guilty knowledge.  The surrounding circumstances are of course relevant and what
the defendant said
or did before or after the act may go to prove his guilty
mind.  Running away is usually equivocal, as Laws J rightly said it was
in the
present case, because flight from the scene can as easily follow a naughty
action as a wicked one.  There must, however, be
a few cases where running away
would indicate guilty knowledge, where an act is either wrong or innocent and
there is no room for
mere naughtiness.  An example might be selling drugs at a
street corner and fleeing at the sight of a
policeman.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
The Divisional Court here, assuming that the presumption applied, would have
reversed the youth court, rightly, in my opinion, because
there was no evidence,
outside the commission of the &#8216;offence&#8217;, upon which one could find
that the presumption had been
rebutted.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
In order to obtain that kind of evidence, apart from anything the defendant may
have said or done, the prosecution has to rely on
interviewing the suspect or
having him psychiatrically examined (two methods which depend on receiving
co-operation) or on evidence
from someone who knows the defendant well, such as
a teacher, the involvement of whom adversely to the child is
unattractive.&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>6. Mr Zahra submitted that
the issue of whether or not the Crown had rebutted doli incapax was a matter for
the trial judge and not
the jury.  He submitted that on this issue the jury has
no role to play.  In support of that submission he relied upon the decision
of
the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>R v CRH </i>(supra).  </p>
<p><br>7. I do not accept that submission.  </p>
<p><br>8. It seems to me that <i>CRH</i> is not to be read in the manner for
which Mr Zahra contended, but consideration of the submission requires close
attention to the
judgment of Newman J in <i>CRH.</i>  With his decision the
other members of the court agreed.</p>
<p><br>9. In <i>CRH,</i> at the close of the prosecution case, the appellant
made an application similar to that made here by Mr Zahra, namely that the jury
be directed to return a verdict of not guilty upon the basis that the Crown had
not rebutted the common law presumption that the
accused was doli incapax.  That
application was rejected and on appeal it was argued that the trial judge was in
error in his rejection.
 The case concerned the alleged sexual assaults upon a
young female by a twelve year old male.  The complainant child gave evidence
as
to the commission of the offences charged and the appellant gave evidence
denying the misconduct alleged.  He made no admissions
to the police and
essentially, on the analysis of Newman J, the evidence relied upon by the Crown
to rebut the common law presumption
of doli incapax was the evidence of the
complainant as to the commission of the offence.  Newman J referred to the
decision in <i>C</i> and cited the passages I have already recorded.  His Honour
determined that the dicta from Lord Lowry stated the law in Australia.
 His
Honour said then (at p 13 of his judgment):</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>&#8220;That being so...the evidence was
insufficient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax having regard to the
criminal standard
of proof.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>10. It seems to me that what his Honour was saying in <i>CRH </i>was that
upon analysis of the facts of that case all that the Crown had proved was in
effect the doing of the act charged and this
was not enough.  Hence there was no
evidence upon which the jury could act to find that the relevant presumption had
been rebutted.
 I should add that there is authority for the proposition that
&#8220;naughtiness&#8221; as a state of mind in child sexual cases
has been
expressed as not uncommon in children of the appellant&#8217;s age in
<i>CRH</i>:  see <i>A v DPP</i> (1997) 1 Cr App R 27 at 33.</p>
<p><br>11. It seems to me though that Mr Zahra&#8217;s submission that the
decision in <i>CRH</i> has the consequence that the jury has no role to play in
determining whether the presumption of doli incapax has been rebutted reads
into
the decision that which is not there.  Nowhere do any of the members of the
court in <i>CRH</i> express as a statement of principle that the jury has no
role to play on this issue.  What occurred in <i>CRH </i>was simply that there
was no evidence available for the jury&#8217;s consideration upon which it
<u>could </u>act to make a finding that the presumption had been rebutted.  The
Court of Criminal Appeal did not say that if there was evidence
available for
the jury&#8217;s consideration it nevertheless was not a jury question as to
whether the presumption had been rebutted.</p>
<p><br>12. Mr Zahra was not able to draw my attention to any statement of
principle to support his submission and I have been able to find
no authority to
support it either. In <i>R v Gorrie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2083%20JP%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 83 JP 136</a> Salter J directed the
jury that the prosecution</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;must satisfy the jury that when the boy did this he knew that he was
doing what was wrong - not merely what was wrong but
what was gravely wrong,
seriously wrong.&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>13. That direction was
cited with apparent approval by Bray CJ in <i>The Queen v M</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2016%20SASR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 16 SASR
589</a> at 593 and in <i>The King v Brooks</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%20NZLR%20854" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) NZLR 854</a> it is clear that the
Court of Appeal proceeded upon the basis that it was for the Crown to satisfy
the jury as opposed to the trial
judge, that a child under the age of fourteen
years knew the act or omission charged against him was wrong.  </p>
<p><br>14. In my opinion it is for the trial judge to determine whether there is
evidence upon which the jury properly instructed <u>could </u>conclude that the
presumption has been rebutted by the Crown.  If there is such evidence, it is
not for the trial judge to direct
an acquittal, even it be the case that the
judge himself, if left to determine the issue of doli incapax, would resolve it
in the
accused&#8217;s favour.  It is well settled that a trial judge does not
have the power to direct a verdict of acquittal simply because
he assesses that
the evidence is such that a verdict based upon it would be unsafe and
unsatisfactory:  see, for example, <i>R v Prasad</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2023%20SASR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 23 SASR 161</a> and <i>R
v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 74.</a>  In the latter case, Gleeson CJ, with whose judgment
the other members of the court agreed, referred to the decision of the High
Court in <i>Whitehorn v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20152%20CLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 152 CLR 657</a> and to the observations
made by Dawson J in that case at 675 as to aspects of trial procedure which
restrict the extent to which
a trial judge may intervene.  The Chief Justice
went on to say this (at 85):</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;To the aspects mentioned by Dawson J I would add the role of the jury as
the tribunal of fact.  It is that consideration,
rather than any point of legal
technicality, which underlies the decisions in cases such as <i>R v
Galbraith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20WLR%201039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 WLR 1039</a>, <i>R v Prasad (supra)</i>, <i>Attorney
General's Reference</i> (No. 1 of 1983) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1983/101.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] VicRp 101</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20VR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 2 VR 410</a>, and <i>Mezzo</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2027%20CCC%203d%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
27 CCC 3d 97.</a>  The legal principles which underpin the narrower view in turn
flow from, or are particular manifestations of, that basic aspect
of criminal
justice.  <u>It is one thing to recognise in courts of criminal appeal a power
to review a jury&#8217;s determination of fact.  It is another thing
altogether
to permit a trial judge to pre-empt such a
determination</u>.&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<i>(Emphasis added)</i></blockquote></blockquote><p><br>15. In my opinion, to
accede to the application made by Mr Zahra would have the consequence of
pre-empting the jury&#8217;s determination
of a factual issue which it is
charged to determine.</p>
<p><br>16. If there was no evidence upon which the jury could properly conclude
that the presumption was rebutted, then it would be proper
for me as the trial
judge to direct the jury to acquit the accused.  However, Mr Zahra concedes that
there is evidence available
upon which a tribunal could act; his submission is
that the court should not act upon that evidence so as to find that the
presumption
of doli incapax has been rebutted.  That is a submission properly to
be pursued with the jury and no doubt, as a consequence of my
decision on this
application, it will be vigorously pursued with the jury by Mr Zahra.</p>
<p><br>17. It seems to me that there are a number of features of the evidence
available for the jury&#8217;s consideration on the issue as
to whether the
Crown has rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in the case of this accused. 
Mr Zahra has dealt with a number
of these features in his submission, proceeding
as he has done upon the basis that it was for me to make the evaluation of the
evidence
and for me to determine, as he submitted I should determine, that the
Crown had not discharged its onus in this regard.  </p>
<p><br>18. In <i>C,</i> Lord Lowry identified as possible sources of evidence to
rebut the presumption the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(i)  the surrounding circumstances of the commission of the offence </p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>(ii)  what the accused may have said or done;</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>(iii)  evidence from teachers or others who know
the accused well;</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>(iv) psychiatric assessment of the accused.</p>
<p><br>19. The Crown has here submitted that there is material available for the
jury&#8217;s consideration in each of the above categories<b>.</b></p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(i)	Whilst the evidence does not reveal that there was anything untoward before
the deceased and the accused reached the Big Rock
area, there is the evidence
that once there the accused picked up and carried a protesting and struggling
child much smaller than
himself to the edge of the rock before then pushing or
dropping him into the water.  There is the verbal exchange on the way to the
edge of the rock referred to in (ii) below, culminating in the accused saying
<i>&#8220;too bad&#8221;.  </i>There are then the features of the rock face
itself and of the river below.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(ii)	There are the utterances attributed to the accused.  It seems to me that it
is for the jury to decide as a matter of fact whether
what was said indicated
the accused&#8217;s state of mind at the time he put the child in the water, and
an appreciation of the seriousness
of what he had done (see <i>C</i> (supra) and
<i>L</i> (supra) at 505).<p>
<p>
As he was forcing the deceased towards the edge of the rock, the latter
protested <i>&#8220;Luke is going to chuck me in&#8221;</i> and the accused said
<i>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re not.&#8221;</i>  Then after the child entered the
water the accused asserted he was going to get help.  There is evidence contrary
to his entertaining
any such intention in what he said to the young girls he met
after he left Big Rock.  The accounts of GW1 and GW2 are not entirely
consistent
the one with the other.  According to GW1 she asked the accused did he know
where the deceased was and was told that he
was down in the bush but that the
whereabouts were none of her business.  She said that the accused asserted that
he did not know
where the child was in the
bush.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
	GW2 gave a different account and said that when the girls encountered the
accused he called GW1 over and said Corey was down the
river in the
water.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
	Whilst there are discrepancies given by GW1 and by GW2 it is for the jury to
determine what evidence it accepts from either source.
 It would be open to the
jury to conclude that in what he said to GW1 he was concealing what had happened
to the deceased.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
	Then there is the evidence of the conversation which the accused had with
Constable French.  I detailed this conversation when delivering
an earlier
judgment as to the admissibility of the evidence of Constable French and I will
not repeat the relevant conversation here.
 There is evidence that in that
statement the accused did not tell the truth concerning what happened in his
encounter with GW1 shortly
after the accused left the deceased in the
water.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
	It is for the jury to assess the significance of all the above utterances by
the accused in considering the doli incapax
issue.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(iii)	The jury has the evidence before it of three school teachers who taught
the accused prior to March 1998, Ms Scott, Ms Calderon
and Ms Robinson.  Each of
these teachers gave evidence as to the accused being behind intellectually and
no doubt this is a matter
upon which Mr Zahra will place much emphasis in
addressing the jury.  However, looking at the Crown&#8217;s case at its highest,
and this is relevant in determining if there is evidence upon which a jury could
find that the Crown has rebutted the presumption
of doli incapax, the teachers
all gave evidence concerning the behaviour of the accused at school.  Ms Scott
said that the accused
presented no problem in observing classroom rules.  Nor
did he present a problem in relation to playground rules except for the out
of
bounds rule.  This was a rule introduced during the course of the
accused&#8217;s schooling that separated children of his age
from those of
kindergarten age.  The accused was slow to conform with that rule.  Ms Calderon
gave evidence that the accused was
well behaved.  He did get into trouble but no
more than she regarded as being normal.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
	Ms Robinson, who started to teach the accused only weeks before the death of
the deceased, said that the behaviour of the accused
was &#8220;perfect&#8221;. 
He followed the class rules and records were kept of any breaches of playground
rules.  There was no
record of any such breach by the accused. 
</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
	The evidence of the teachers assumes emphasis from the evidence of Dr
Wotton.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(iv)	Dr Wotton, a child psychiatrist, interviewed the accused&#8217;s mother
once and the accused himself twice, these interviews
taking place very shortly
before the trial.  The history that the mother gave the doctor was that the
accused was an average boy
who gave no particular trouble, and considering that
history and the assessments of the teachers about the behaviour of the accused
at school, Dr Wotton expressed the view that if there had been major problems in
the accused understanding the difference between
right and wrong then this would
have shown up in his everyday behaviour at home and at school.  Dr Wotton
considered on this material
that the accused probably understood the difference
between right and wrong in the school setting and in the home setting.  The
significance
of this in the present context is a matter for the jury.<p>
<p>
There is further evidence of Dr Wotton which assumes particular relevant in the
context of Mr Zahra&#8217;s submission.  When asked
about the significance of
the accused, as it were, &#8220;running away&#8221; from Big Rock, Dr Wotton
said it was possible that
this was indicative of an failure to understand the
consequences of his actions, but Dr Wotton&#8217;s further evidence was that
to
the effect that the behaviour reflected an anxiety about what happened and a
perceived need by the accused to conceal his part
in it.  The jury could regard
this as indicative of an awareness of serious wrongdoing, although as Lord Lowry
observed in <i>C</i>, <i>&#8220;running away is usually
equivocal&#8221;</i>.</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>20. In my opinion as the
evidence stands, there is evidence upon which the jury could find that the Crown
has rebutted the presumption
of doli incapax, and in these circumstances it is
not appropriate for me to determine whether the jury should do so.</p>
<p><br>21. Hence the application failed and the trial has
proceeded.<br><br><br><br>**********<br><br>LAST UPDATED: 	28/10/2009</p>
