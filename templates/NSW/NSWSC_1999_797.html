<b>1082/96	MICHAEL CAMPBELL LOWE v BARRY ARTHUR LANG and EROLGREEN PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT (see page 353 of transcript)
<P>

 
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	Application was made on the first day of the trial on
behalf of the plaintiff for a further amendment of the amended statement
of
claim.  The principal substance of the amendment sought is an amendment to par
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20Public%20Administration%20Review%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3.  Par 3</a> as it stood alleged that the promise made by the first defendant to
the plaintiff is that he "would pay to the Plaintiff 20 per cent
of any
royalties earned by the First Defendant from the Quarry over the life of the
Quarry".  The amendment seeks to remove from
that formula the words "by the
First Defendant", so that the amended par 3 will allege an obligation by the
first defendant to pay
to the plaintiff a sum equivalent to 20 per cent of the
royalties earned, whether, in the event, if the quarry proceeded, those moneys
were paid to the first defendant or to some other person or entity nominated by
him.  As I have said, it was not until the first
day of the trial that this
amendment was sought.  On the other hand, this being a case in which written
evidence has been filed,
no amendment to the evidence was sought by reason of
the proposed amendment to the pleading; the amended pleading would be based
upon, and, it is said, in accordance with, the evidence, particularly the
evidence of the vital conversation, already filed.
<P>

2   	Mr Deakin, of Queen's Counsel for the defendants, has
objected that this effects a radical change to the form of contract alleged,
and that at a very late stage.  There is justice in the suggestion that the
form of the contract sued upon would be significantly
changed by this
amendment.  However, as already said, the amendment in a sense brings the
pleading into accordance with the evidence
already filed.  Furthermore,
although Mr Deakin has expressed fears as to prejudice that may be suffered by
the defendants arising
from the amendment, he is now on the eighth day of the
trial unable to specify any prejudice that the defendants will suffer which
is
incurable.
<P>

3   	The result is that I propose to allow the amendment and to
grant leave to the plaintiff to file in Court the further amended
statement of
claim which has been brought forward as embodying the amendment in the form
finally desired:  see <b>The State of Queensland</b> <b>v J L Holdings Pty
Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146.</a>  However, it should be said that if, during the
further hearing of the proceedings, the defendants find themselves under
prejudice
by reason of this change of course on the plaintiff's part, I shall
make whatever directions are necessary by way of adjournment
or otherwise to
permit that prejudice to be met, and the defendants are reserved leave to make
application in that regard. 
<P>

4   	There has also been debated before me a question of
particulars relating to par 28 of the further amended statement of claim,
there
being no amendment made to this paragraph by the amendment recently allowed.
Earlier during the trial, Mr Deakin complained
of the generality of the
allegations made in par 28, and, in particular, of the lack of any statement as
to how the partnership and/or
joint venture alleged in that paragraph were
constituted or came into effect.  I indicated that I was of the view that,
despite the
lateness of the application, the defendants were entitled to
particulars of the terms of the partnership and/or joint venture alleged,
and
as to how that partnership and/or joint venture arose.  These were furnished by
the plaintiff to the defendants in a document
which I have this morning
admitted as Ex D.  The document as admitted contains an amendment suggested by
me as a result of a complaint
of Mr Deakin.
<P>

5   	Mr Deakin makes two other complaints about the document.
One is as to the uncertainty of the term "control" in par 2(d).  I
do not think
there is any difficulty about this.  I think the subparagraph simply adverts to
the fact that, as Mr Lang was the owner
of the land, he was the person who
could nominate to whom the royalty ought be to be paid, that is, either to
himself or some other
person or entity nominated by him.  Mr Taylor, of counsel
for the plaintiff, has confirmed from the Bar table that the word "control"
in
that context refers to no more than what I have just stated.  However, Mr
Deakin also complains that the term "instructions given
and representations
made" in par 2(c) calls for further particulars; Mr Taylor replies that they
are all matters already contained
within the evidence.
<P>

6   	However, on the ordinary law relating to particulars that
is no answer.  The opposing party is entitled not to be told, "Go
and look in
the evidence," but to be told how it is that the alleging party seeks to make
out its case.  In those circumstances,
I direct that the plaintiff give to the
defendants particulars of the instructions and representations alleged in par
2(c) of the
particulars of par 28 which are Ex D.
<P>

7   	All questions of costs arising from these applications are
reserved.
