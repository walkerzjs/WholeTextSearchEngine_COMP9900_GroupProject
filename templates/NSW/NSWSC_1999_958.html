FRIDAY 24 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>2951/91	DI MICHELLE BLACKLER v FELPURE PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings were commenced on 30 June 1999 and
heard with expedition.  In the Amended Summons the plaintiff
claims a
declaration that she duly exercised an option for renewal of lease, specific
performance of the agreement to lease arising
on exercise of the option, a
declaration that the lease has been extended to 30 June 2000 by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.7</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>, a declaration that a notice of termination given
about 14 December 1998 and purportedly terminating the lease on 30 June 1999
had
no effect, and injunctions restraining interference with her occupation.
She also claims damages and costs.  In the Cross-claim the
defendant claims
possession and also declarations in the contrary sense to those claimed by the
plaintiff.
<P>

2  	Lease 0463564 relates to the premises being the ground floor of
365 Port Hacking Road, Caringbah. The building also contains
an upper-storey
which has been used as an office although at present it is vacant; the
plaintiff has never had any interest in the
upper-storey. The Lease was granted
to the plaintiff by the then registered proprietors, John Cheung Chiu Tse and
Ping Tse; the land
in Folio 3/26093, Lot 3 Deposited Plan 26093 at Caringbah,
in the Sutherland Shire, Parish of Sutherland and County of Cumberland.
 The
Lease was duly registered. The shop is situated centrally in the Caringbah
Shopping Centre and is used for the Permitted Use
designated by the Lease, that
is Pizza and Pasta Bar.  Pizzas and food to take away are prepared and sold at
the front of the premises
where there is a pizza oven and a shop counter, and
meals are also prepared in the kitchen to the rear of the premises and supplied
to diners in the restaurant area behind the shop. 
<P>

3  	The relationship between the parties is affected by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act 1994</a> and the terms of the Lease show that the parties adverted to
this.  The term created was for three years commencing on 1 July 1995
and
terminating on 30 June 1998 with a first option to renew for three years and a
second option for a further three years.  Provisions
of the Lease which require
special notice are as follows:
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> relates to definitions and interpretations.  Clause 1.01 provides:
<P>

<i>In this Lease unless a contrary intention in any particular provision
appears:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	"the lessor" includes its successors, assigns, servants and agents
(including for the purpose of giving any notice , any Managing
Agent appointed
from time to time by the Lessor).'</i>
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3</a> relates to the term and further terms.  The first option is dealt
with in cl.3.02 and the provisions now material are as follows:
 
<P>

<i>If the Lessee desires to have a renewed Lease of the Premises granted to it
for the further term stated in Item 1 of the Appendix
(...) after the
termination date and gives to the Lessor notice in writing to that effect not
less than three (3) months prior to
the termination date then (...) the Lessor
shall grant to the Lessee a Lease of the Premises for the further term stated
in Item
1 ...".  </i>
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> relates to demolition and is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"7.01	If the lessor wants to demolish, substantially repair, renovate or
reconstruct the building or the part of it containing the
premises (that cannot
be carried out practicably without vacant possession of the premises), and
desires to terminate this lease
as a result of such work, the lessor must
provide the lessee with:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	sufficient details of the proposed works to indicate a genuine
proposal</i>
<P>

<i>	to carry them out within a reasonably practicable time after this </i>
<P>

<i>	lease is to be terminated; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	at least six (6) months, written notice of termination, unless the
term</i>
<P>

<i>	is twelve (12) months or less in which case the notice must be at
least</i>
<P>

<i>three (3) months.</i>
<P>

<i>7.02	After the lessor has given written notice of termination under clause
7.01, the lessee may terminate this lease at any time within
six (6) months
before the termination date in the lessor's notice, by giving the lessor not
less than seven (7) days written notice
of termination (unless the term is
twelve (12) months or less in which case the lessee may give its notice at any
time within three
(3) months before the termination date in the lessor's
notice).</i>
<P>

<i>7.03  If the lessor's works are not carried out within a reasonably
practicable time after the termination date in the lessor's notice,
the lessor
is liable to pay the lessee reasonable compensation for damage suffered by the
lessee as a consequence of the early termination
of this lease, unless the
lessor establishes that at the time notice of termination was given by the
lessor there was a genuine proposal
to demolish the premises within that
time."</i>
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13</a> contains Miscellaneous Provisions and includes in cl.13.03 the
following:
<P>

<i>"13.03	Any notice or other document required to be given or served under
this Lease may be given or served:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	in any manner described in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s170.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.170</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	by certified post, or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	by means of any document exchange service of which the party to be
served is a member;</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<cite>And</cite><i> in the case of any notice or document required to be served
or given by the Lessor to the Lessee the same may be signed on behalf
of the
Lessor by its Managing Agent, manager, property or estate manager, assistant
property manager, secretary, assistant secretary
or solicitor."</i>
<P>

4  	At the time of the grant of the Lease I.G. Martyn Real Estate of
Cronulla were the Managing Agents for Messrs Tse, the lessors.
 On 20 March
1998 the plaintiff gave a written notice of exercise of the first option to
that firm, and receipt of the notice was
acknowledged in writing by Mr M.
Christian of that firm.  The notice clearly indicated her wish to exercise the
option.
<P>

5  	On 26 March 1998 the defendant entered into a contract with
Messrs Tse as vendors to buy the whole building.  On 30 April 1998
I.G. Martyn
Real Estate informed the plaintiff by letter "<i>Once all arrears are brought
up to date we are authorised by the current and new owners to exercise your
option for a further four
years pursuant to the terms of your current
lease."</i> On 13 May 1998 the plaintiff paid up arrears of rent then due.
<P>

6  	On 15 May 1998 the defendant completed its purchase from Messrs
Tse and the transfer to it was registered soon after.  Later
the defendant
disputed that I.G. Martyn Real Estate Pty Ltd had any authority to write on its
behalf on 30 April 1998; but the strength
of the plaintiff's claim is not
affected by whether the firm had that authority.  The claim to be entitled to
grant of a further
lease for three years turns on whether she duly exercised
her option by giving notice in the manner indicated; this is the only ground
of
dispute of her entitlement to an option which the defendant relied on at the
hearing.  
<P>

7  	The plaintiff's entitlement to grant of a further term on
exercise of the first option depends on her having strictly complied
with the
conditions in cl.3.02 upon which the option was to be exercised.  To do so it
was necessary for her to give to Messrs Tse
as the Lessor notice in writing not
less than three months prior to the termination date, that is not less than
three months prior
to 30 June 1998 to the effect that she desired to have a
renewed lease.  The notice which she delivered to I.G. Martyn Real Estate
was
sufficiently clear in its terms and was given in the appropriate time.  The
ground of defence was that it is disputed that it
was given to the lessor.
<P>

8  	Clause 3.02 when expanded by inserting the definition of Lessor
from cl.1.01(a) literally authorises giving the notice to the
lessor or any of
the other classes of persons including the Managing Agent appointed at that
time by Messrs Tse.
<P>

9  	The contention on behalf of the defendant was to the effect that
the reference to the Managing Agent in the definition in clause
1.01(a) is made
only for the purpose of any notice given by or on behalf of the lessor, and is
not made for the purpose of the lessor's
receiving any notice, or for the
purpose of the Managing Agent's receiving any notice on behalf of the lessor.
This  contention rests
on an alleged distinction between giving a notice and
receiving a notice.  
<P>

10  	The defendant's counsel referred me to two decisions of
McLelland J in this Division in which his Honour considered the authority
of
Managing Agents to receive notice of exercise of an option in a lease.  In
<b>Setena Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Nominees (Canberra) Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d322" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) NSW
Conv R 55-322</a> McLelland J applied the terms of the definition of "the lessor"
in a lease with some general similarities to that in the present
case, although
not in exactly the same terms.  At 56,969/2 his Honour expressed this
<i>obiter</i> view: <i>"The management of property leased to tenants would
ordinarily embrace the receiving of a notice from a tenant exercising an option
of renewal of his lease, and in my view a Managing Agent of such property
would, in the absence of proof of some relevant limitation
to his authority, be
presumed to have authority to receive such a notice. (cf <b>Peers v Sneyd
</b>17 Beav<b>.</b> 151<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1853/510.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1853] EngR 510</a>; ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=51%20ER%20990" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">51 ER 990</a>, <b>R v Chief Immigration Officer</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20WLR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973)
1 WLR 141)."</a></i>  In <b>Oscars Town Centre Restaurant Pty Ltd v Port Shores Pty
Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) NSW Conv R 55-331</a> McLelland J made further observations to the
same effect.  
<P>

11  	Counsel also referred to <b>Kratzmann (Toowong) Pty Ltd v
Marjorie's Investments Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20ANZ%20ConvR%20803" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] ANZ ConvR 803</a>, a decision to the
opposite effect.  In <b>Kratzmann (Toowong) Pty Ltd </b>Moynihan J held that a
notice of exercise of option which was to be delivered before the end of March
1986 and was placed in the post
before 31 March and delivered by post on 1
April because of postal delays over Easter, was not delivered in due time.  His
Honour
gave as an alternative ground that the lease did not provide and the
evidence did not show that service of the notice on the managing
agent was
authorised, whether by the terms of the lease or by authority actually
conferred by the lessor.  Moynihan J did not deal
with the general authority of
managing agents or the authorities to which McLelland J referred in his
decisions later in the same
year.  I should respectfully say that I find
McLelland J's view on the general authority of managing agents persuasive.  The
present
proceedings are however disposed of without reliance on general
considerations relating to the authority conferred on Managing Agents.
In the
present case the sufficiency of delivery of the notice to the Managing Agent
appears from the express provisions of the lease.
<P>

12  	In my opinion on a literal reading of cl.1.01(a) the inclusion
of the managing director is an inclusion for the purpose of
giving any notice
irrespective of whether the notice is given by the lessor or to the lessor.
There is no indication in the terms
of the document that the inclusion of the
Managing Agent is made only for the purpose of assisting the position of the
lessor, and
no indication that the inclusion was not made for the purpose of
assisting the giving of the notice by any party other than the lessor.
 
<P>

13  	The terms of cl.1.01 state that it is to be applied unless a
contrary intention appears in any particular provision.  Counsel
was unable to
point me to anything in cl.3.02 which could support the view that the document
expressed a contrary intention with
respect of that provision.  Not only is
there no indication of a contrary intention; there are strong contextual
indications that
the literal meaning of cl1.01(a) was the intended meaning.
One is that in cl.3.02 the process of notifying the lessor of the exercise
of
the option is referred to in language which actually speaks of giving to the
lessor notice - "... give to the lessor notice in
writing to that effect ..."
and the notional insertion into that phrase of the definition of "lessor"
simply picks up and continues
the use of parts of the verb "to give".
<P>

14  	A further contextual consideration is the provision in the
tailpiece of cl.13.03 which establishes the efficacy of the signature
of a
Managing Agent to any notice required to be served or given by the lessor to
the lessee, leaving no work to be done by the reference
in cl.1.01(a) to giving
notices if it related only to notices emanating from the lessor.
<P>

15  	In my opinion the plaintiff complied with the formal requirement
relating to the delivery of notice to Messrs Tse and was,
when the defendant
became registered proprietor in or after May 1998, entitled to specific
performance of the obligation to grant
a renewed lease, by which the defendant
is bound having regard to the registration of the lease.
<P>

16  	On 14 December 1998 solicitors representing the defendants sent
to the plaintiff by letter a notice in these terms:
<P>

<i>"We act for the owner of the above property and are instructed our client
proposes to substantially repair, renovate and reconstruct
the building and
such proposals cannot be carried out practicably without vacant possession of
the premises.</i>
<P>

<i>Accordingly, our client desires to terminate the Lease and you should
consider this letter as Notice of Termination.  You are required
to vacate the
premises on or before 30 June, 1999 and take with you all tenant's fittings and
chattels.</i>
<P>

<i>We note our client proposes to completely gut the premises and carry out the
following works: -</i>
<P>

<i>-	install new shopfront;</i>
<P>

<i>-	new electrical wiring;</i>
<P>

<i>-	new plumbing works;</i>
<P>

<i>-	new ceilings;</i>
<P>

<i>-	removal of all kitchen equipment on the ground floor; </i>
<P>

<i>-	install new toilet facilities.</i>
<P>

<i>Our client is proposing a complete refurbishment of both floors of the
building and we again note that this cannot be carried out
without vacant
possession."</i>
<P>

17  	This letter is plainly recognisable as a notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>.  I set out some provisions of that Act:
<P>

<i>"7	This Act overrides leases</i>
<P>

<i>This Act operates despite the provisions of a lease.  A provision of a lease
is void to the extent that the provision is inconsistent
with a provision of
this Act.  A provision of any agreement or arrangement between the parties to a
lease is void to the extent that
the provision would be void if it were in the
lease.</i>
<P>

<i>16	Minimum 5 year term</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	The term for which a retail shop lease is entered into, together with
any further term or terms provided for by any agreement
or option for the
acquisition by the lessee of a further term as an extension or renewal of the
lease, must not be less than 5 years.
 An agreement or option is not taken into
account if it was entered into or conferred after the lease was entered
into.</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	This section does not apply to a lease that results from the renewal of
an earlier lease pursuant to an option conferred on the
lessee, so long as
there was no break in the entitlement of the lessee to possession of the retail
shop and the option was granted
by the earlier lease or by an agreement entered
into before or at the same time as that earlier lease was entered into.</i>
<P>

<i>35	Demolition</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	If a retail shop lease provides for termination of the lease on the
grounds of proposed demolition of the building of which the
retail shop forms
part, the lease is taken to include provision to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	The lease cannot be terminated on that ground unless and until the
lessor  has provided the lessee with details of the proposed
demolition
sufficient to indicate a genuine proposal to demolish that building within a
reasonably practicable time after the lease
is to be terminated.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The lease cannot be terminated by the lessor on that ground without at
least 6 months written notice of termination.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	If notice of termination on that ground is given to the lessee, the
lessee may terminate the lease by giving the lessor not less
than 7 days
written notice of termination at any time within 6 months before the
termination date notified by the lessor.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	If the lease is for a term of 12 months or less, the period of 6 months
in subsection (1)(b) and (c) is shortened in each case
to 3 months.</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	If a retail shop lease is terminated on such a ground and demolition of
the building is not carried out within a reasonably practicable
time after the
termination date notified by the lessor, the lessor is liable to pay the lessee
reasonable compensation for the lessor
is liable to pay the lessee reasonable
compensation for damage suffered by the lessee as a consequence of the early
termination of
the lease, unless the lessor establishes that at the time notice
of termination was given by the lessor there was a genuine proposal
to demolish
the premises within that time.</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	For the purposes of this section, demolition of the building of which a
retail shop forms part includes any substantial  repair,
renovation or
reconstruction of the building that cannot be carried out practicably without
vacant possession of the shop."</i>
<P>

18  	It appears to be an assumption on which the notice was given
that the option had been duly exercised and that the plaintiff
was not simply
holding over after the expiry of the three year term without exercise of the
option.
<P>

19  	The defendant did not rely on any breach of covenant and so far
as appears no notice was ever given under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.133E(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act
1919</a>.
<P>

20  	On behalf of the plaintiff it was contended that the statutory
extension of the term of a retail lease to a minimum of five
years brought
about by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> operates so that a right to terminate the lease, such as the
right to terminate the lease for demolition conferred by cl.7 and regulated
by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a>, cannot be exercised so as to terminate the lease at any date before five
years from its grant, in this case before 30 June 2000.
 
<P>

21  	In approaching this question it is always necessary to keep in
view <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> and its avoidance of provisions in leases
inconsistent with provisions of that Act.
<P>

22  	The Lease as granted is not modified in its operation by
subs.16(1) because the term of 3 years for which the lease was entered
into
together with the further two terms each of 3 years for which options existed
is not less than five years.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 16(2)</a> does not operate to affect the
term of the lease and nothing would have been achieved if a solicitor's
certificate under subs.16(3)
had been obtained. .  It appears from the terms of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> does not operate and the further provisions for which it
provides are not taken to be included in the lease unless the lease provides
for termination on the ground of proposed demolition, but that if the lease
does so provide, the provisions of the lease operate
with the provisions which
the lease is taken to include.  Both must be complied with and if there is an
inconsistency <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> is to prevail  The plaintiff's argument would require that
this is in some way inconsistent with the requirement of subs.16(1) to
the
effect that the term for which a retail shop lease is entered into must not be
less than five years that the lease contains a
demolition clause, and that the
operation of the demolition clause together with the provisions which the lease
is taken to include
is inconsistent with subs.16(1) in so far as termination
for demolition can take place less than five years after grant.
<P>

23  	Counsel drew my attention to the decision of the King's Bench
Division in <b>Quinlan v Avis</b> (1933) 149 Law Times 214 where a lease was
held to be a "valid lease for a term of not less than two years" although the
tenant had
an option to determine the lease before the expiration of two years.
The point decided is generally similar to the point before me
but the
legislation was different and their Lordship's ex tempore consideration was
brief, and I do not derive any assistance from
that decision.  <b>Kushner v Law
Society</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%202%20All%20ER%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] 2 All ER 404</a> could be thought of as to a similar effect but
the statutory context is even more dissimilar. 
<P>

24  	I was also referred to the discussion in "Commercial Tenancy Law
in Australia" 2nd ed. 1997 by Dr Bradbrook and Dr Cross at
p.21.

25  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 16</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">35</a> use two quite different basic concepts.  The
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> are built around the term for which a lease is entered into.
The impact of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> depends on the provisions of the lease when the lease was
entered into, and what the lease said then about the term for which it
was
entered into.  The basic concept of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> is a provision for termination on the
grounds of proposed demolition.  For this concept to have any application the
termination must
take place before the expiry of the term for which the lease
was entered into; the assumption of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> is that the term for which the lease
was entered into is to be cut short, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> imposes controls on the process
of cutting it short.  There is no guarantee in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> that the
term for which a retail shop lease is entered into will not, after it is
entered into, be interrupted by any supervening
event.  There could be
supervening events which bring the term to an end by conduct of a public
authority such as resumption of the
land, and there also could be supervening
events which bring the term for which a lease is entered into to an end before
the expiry
of the term through the operation of provisions of the lease itself.
Leases commonly contain express or implied provisions under
which their terms
can be brought to an end for breach of covenant; such provisions are not, as
far as I have observed, regulated
by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>, although they
are regulated by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.  There could I suppose be
provisions of other kinds under which a lease may be terminated; provisions for
termination on the grounds
of proposed demolition of the building are regulated
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a>, but provisions for termination on other grounds, if there are such
provisions in leases, do not appear to have been regulated by
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases
Act</a>.  
<P>

26  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> provides a number of protections for
lessees.  It protects them under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> by fixing a minimum term for which a
lease is to be entered into, and it protects lessees under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> by restricting
the operation of demolition clauses.  The provisions of the Act overall appear
to me to show contemplation that there
should be both minimum terms and also
demolition clauses which potentially might bring the terms to a premature
end.
<P>

27  	The presence in the lease of cl.7 and its provisions for
termination on the grounds of proposed demolition are not inconsistent
with and
in my view have no impact on the requirement of subs.16(1) relating to the
length of the term for which the shop lease is
entered into.  The recognition,
implied from the presence of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> in the Act, that leases may be terminated,
but subject to its provisions appears to me to confirm that terminations of
leases may
take place without regard to whether a term of five years will have
expired when termination of the lease on the ground of proposed
demolition
takes place.
<P>

28  	On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that termination of
the lease under the demolition clause is or is analogous to
forfeiture of the
term and that relief against this forfeiture is available.  However there is no
element of breach or default on
behalf of the lessee, and no event which by any
analogy could be considered a forfeiture or penalty or be the subject of
equitable
jurisdiction to grant relief.
<P>

29  	The plaintiff contended that the notice dated 14 December 1998
purportedly under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> did not validly terminate the
plaintiff's lease.  Although no evidence shows the exact date and manner of the
plaintiff's receiving
the two letters of 14 December 1998 setting out the terms
of this notice it was established by concession that she received them
soon
after that day and before the end of December 1998; so the notices were given
in due time to terminate the lease on 30 June
1999 if they were otherwise
effective.
<P>

30  	It was contended for the plaintiff that a purpose for which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a>
was enacted is the protectin of the lessee and that the notice was given for a
purpose for which such a notice may not be given.
 It was contended the purpose
discernible from many provisions in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> is protection of the
lessee's security of possession and the lessee's interest in the goodwill in
respect of the retail business.
<P>

31  	It was further contended that the defendant is subject to a duty
of good faith in exercising rights under cl.7 and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a>; counsel referred to the
discussion of a contractual duty of good faith in the judgment of Sheller JA in
<b>Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 483</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 349.</a>  It is quite
clear from the evidence tendered on behalf of the defendant that a purpose of
the defendant's proposed works, referred
to in its notice and said to
constitute demolition within the extended meaning in subs.35(4), is to make the
ground floor of the
building suitable for occupation by the defendant as the
business premises of its own real estate agency, and for letting out the
upper
storey.  The works referred to in the notice, and other works which the
defendant intends to carry out, will have the effect
of making the building
altogether unsuitable for occupation as a pizza and pasta bar, and suitable for
the defendant's real estate
agency business.  In my opinion it is required that
the lessor in fact should have a genuine proposal to demolish the building
within
a reasonably practical time after the lease is to be terminated.  It is
quite clear as a matter of fact, and was not in substance
disputed, that the
defendant in the person of its principal Mr Savelle genuinely proposes to
proceed with work, and to do so as soon
as can be arranged so as to be able to
move into the premises on the expiry of its present lease of premises nearby on
4 January
2000.  
<P>

32  	A duty of good faith in the exercise of its contractual right to
terminate the lease should in my view be implied in the lease;
the implication
is readily made as it could not possibly have been the intention of the parties
that the lease should be terminated
on the mere delivery of notice asserting a
particular intention but in the absence of any actual intention of that kind.
Other principles
which also support this conclusion are the principle requiring
the exercise of contractual powers which may affect the rights of
others to be
undertaken in good faith for the purposes for which the power was conferred and
at a more basic level the principle
which vitiates fraud would deprive a notice
asserting that there was an intention to demolish premises from any effect if
in fact
there was no such intention.  However those situations do not relate to
the present facts, and there is no reason why an intention
of the defendant to
occupy the premises itself, or it may be to lease them out to some particular
identified person after the works
have been carried out, establishes the
exercise as not being carried out in good faith.  The defendant can exercise
its power to
terminate the lease with a view to its own advantage; it is for
purposes of that kind that contractual entitlements generally exist.
<P>

33  	The effectiveness of the defendant's supposed termination of the
lease depends on whether the letter of 14 December 1998 meets
the requirements
of subs.35(1) para.(a), and whether the details set out in the letter actually
constitute details of work which
is to be treated as demolition under
subs.35(4).
<P>

34  	It will be seen from the expressions in subs.35(1) that a lease
cannot be terminated without at least six months' written notice
of
termination.  That is to say, termination is a different act to giving written
notice.  Paragraph (a) operates on the act of terminating
the lease; it does
not prescribe what must appear in the written notice, and the requirement that
the lessor provide the lessee with
details of the proposed demolition could be
complied with less than six months before termination and otherwise than in
writing.
 There is no evidence that any details were in fact provided in any
other way or at any other time than with the letter of 14 December
1998.  What
paragraph (a) requires, according to its express terms, is the provision of
details, and that the details provided should
be sufficient to indicate a
genuine proposal.  Although it is not expressly enacted that there must be a
genuine proposal it is in
my view a necessary implication that a genuine
proposal must exist; it could not have been intended that the requirement could
be
satisfied by a provision of details which was untrue.  
<P>

35  	The effectiveness of the termination is to be decided upon the
basis of what the details provided sufficiently indicate, not
upon the basis of
what the underlying proposal was.  This fine distinction is of some importance
in the present case because in December
1998 the defendant proposed and now
still proposes to do further works which were not mentioned in the notice.  The
further works
relate to extending the building, and the extension which is
feasible and the further works have not been established because the
defendant's architect has not conducted an appropriate inspection.  There is a
need to obtain the Shire Council's Development Consent
for any such extension
whereas the Shire Council may not require an application for Development
Consent for the works specified in
the letter of 14 December 1998.  
<P>

36  	The plaintiff's counsel contended that the provision of details
did not comply with para.(a) because some of the works which
are proposed were
not referred to.  In my view the facts that the defendant proposes to do
further works, and may do them subject
to the need to obtain Development
Consent, and proposed to do them at the same time as the works specified in the
notice, do not
establish that para.(a) was not complied with.  It is not
necessary for compliance with para.(a) to furnish every detail of the proposed
demolition, and it is enough if the details provided are sufficient to indicate
a genuine proposal to demolish.  If that is indicated,
it is not a defect in
the provision of details that more is to be done.
<P>

37  	It is in my view significant to consider the purpose for which
the provision which the Lease is taken to include requires that
details be
provided.  The requirement to provide details is not merely a formal step
imposed in the lessor's path, but the details
are to be provided so that the
lessee can come to a conclusion about whether the termination will be
effective, and whether the lessee
should accept that it will be effective or
dispute it.  The sufficiency of details provided should be tested in relation
to that
purpose. The question is whether the details provided are sufficient to
indicate a genuine proposal to demolish the building; if
they are not the
termination cannot take place and if they are it will be effective no matter
what other details of the proposed
demolition exist or could have been
provided.
<P>

38  	There is on the evidence tendered by the defendant, particularly
of Mr Sevelle no reason to doubt that there is a genuine proposal
to do the
work described in the letter of 14 December 1998, and to do further work
subject to Development Consent, with the object
of providing the defendant
itself with office space in which to operate when its present lease expires on
4 January 2000, and also
of creating enlarged office space in the upper storey
which the defendant now proposes to let to its solicitor.  There was no attack
on the genuineness of this proposal and the proofs of it are clear<i>.</i>
<P>

39  	The time when the demolition is to take place is not required by
para.(b) of subs.35(1) to be provided in writing.  That time
is not one of the
details which are required by para (a) to be provided, but is a characteristic
of the proposal which the details
are to indicate.  The reference to a
reasonably practicable time establishes a characteristic of the proposal; it
does not establish
one of the details which are required to be provided.  The
proposal indicated must be a proposal to demolish the building within
a
reasonably practicable time, not within a stated time, and to meet that
requirement the proposal must be sufficiently well-developed
and mature to
proceed within a reasonably practicable time.  A proposal which was immature or
only partly formed or to which the
lessor was not committed could not comply.
All buildings eventually come to the end of their lives and have to be
demolished, and
it was necessary for para.(a) to circumvent manoeuvres such as
terminating leases on the basis that the building would come to the
end of its
useful life in five or ten years' time, or that the locality would come under
redevelopment pressures in five or ten years'
time, so that the building would
then have to be re-demolished. 
<P>

40  	In submissions relating to testing whether the details provided
were sufficient to indicate a genuine proposal for a demolition
falling within
the extended definition in subs.35(4) the plaintiff's counsel gave emphasis to
the requirements that the repair, renovation
or reconstruction be
<b>substantial</b>, and that the work<b> cannot</b> be carried out
<b>practicably</b> without <b>vacant possession</b> of the shop.  In my view
there can be no doubt that the particulars indicate a renovation which is
substantial.  Counsel referred
me to several authorities in which the word
"substantial" has had judicial consideration including <b>Dainford Ltd v
Lam</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20255" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 255</a> at 268 (Powell J) and to dictionary definitions, and
since the argument I have seen observations in the judgment of the High Court
of Australia in <b>Wong &amp; Ors v Silkfield Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 48</a> at 27.
In my view the works described are substantial in any available shade of
meaning. 
<P>

41  	Counsel also pointed out that "vacant possession" can refer to
vacant physical possession or to legal possession of vacant
premises; counsel
referred to observations of Wallace J in <b>Di Salvio v Manthorpe</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20NSWR%20360" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965]
NSWR 360</a> at 361-362. Counsel referred me to the speech of Lord Kilbrandon in
<b>Heath v Drown</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20AC%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] AC 498</a> at 516-517 where his Lordship with the
concurrence of the majority held that the reference to "obtaining possession of
the holding"
in s.30(1)(f) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/lata1954177/" class="autolink_findacts">Landlord and Tenant Act 1954</a> (UK) was a
reference to the legal right to possession.  Although that provision deals with
the generally similar subject of a lessor
seeking to obtain possession where
the landlord intends to demolish or reconstruct the premises, it is quite
unlike subs.35(4) and
the expression "vacant possession" is not used.
<P>

42  	The context in s.35 of interaction between possession and
carrying out building works points clearly towards "vacant possession"
referring to vacant physical possession, and in that context legal entitlement
to possession cannot be of significance.
<P>

43  	"Practicably" is an adverb qualifying the verbal phrase "cannot
be carried out in cl.35(1)(a) Counsel referred me to dictionary
definitions of
"practicably" and to the use of that word elsewhere in Pt.4 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act 1994</a>.  In the Macquarie Dictionary 2nd Revised Edition 1987 the
first definition of "practicable" is <i>"1.  Capable of being put into
practice, done or effected, esp. with the available means or with reasonable
prudence; feasible."</i>  Counsel also produced an extract from the New Shorter
Oxford (which edition is this) Dictionary which gave the following definition
<i>"1.  Able to be put into practice; able to be effected, accomplished, or
done; feasible."</i>  It will be seen that the Macquarie Dictionary introduces
reference to action with available means or with reasonable prudence, which
does not appear in the other definition.  Counsel also referred me to the
article in Fowler's Modern English Usage 2nd ed. 1965.
<P>

44  	I was also referred to case law in which "practicable" was
considered in different statutory contexts: <b>Re</b> <b>Affairs of
Farquhar</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%202%20All%20ER%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 2 All ER 781</a>, <b>Lee v Nursery Furnishings Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%201%20All%20ER%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 1
All ER 387</a> and <b>Adsett v K &amp; L Steelfounders and Engineers Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%201%20All%20ER%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953)
1 All ER 97 (Note).</a>  Context is important for the meaning of the word
"practicable" and the statutory contexts in those cases were remote from the
present.
 
<P>

45  	Counsel for the Plaintiff contended that evidence shows that the
work proposed can be carried out without disturbing the plaintiff's
possession
or with minimal disturbances to the plaintiff's possession if special measures
are taken in the management of the building
work, so that work is done during
hours when the Pizza Bar and Restaurant are not open for business, and special
measures are taken
such as cleaning up dust and debris and covering work after
each working day so that the premises will be available for trade.  Of
course
measures like those would significantly increase the cost of the work and
extend the time taken for its performance.  In counsel's
contentions however
the consideration that the legislation was, as many of its provision tend to
show, enacted for the purpose of
protection of the interests of lessees
indicates that the force of "practicably" is that if it is feasible, by
measures such as these,
to carry out the work of renovation without obtaining
vacant possession, it should not be said that the work cannot be carried out
practicably without vacant possession.  Counsel contended that the shade of
meaning given by the Macquarie Dictionary, incorporating
reference to the
available means or with reason and prudence, is not the intended sense of
"practicable" because of the overall purpose
of the legislation, and because of
the qualification of "practicable" by the word "reasonably" in other passages.
In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33(b)</a>, the tailpiece of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34</a> and in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35(1)(a)</a> the expression "reasonably
practicable" is used.
<P>

46  	If subs.(4) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s35</a> bore a meaning in which work of renovation
was excluded from the definition of "demolition" if the work could be carried
out by adopting
unusual working methods and times and incurring unusual expense
I cannot see that the word "practicably" would actually be contributing
anything to the meaning of subs.(4).  It would be difficult to see a purpose
for a provision which had the effect that if it is in
any way physically
possible to work around the tenant, regardless of the difficulties of so doing,
the work is not demolition as
defined, and if there were an intention to confer
protection of that kind it could be expressed in a clear way.  The use of the
word
"practicably" appears to me to invoke consideration and assessment of
practical concerns such as time, expense and inconvenience
and to turn
attention away from theoretical exercises and from considering what could be
achieved by unusual expedients.  From time
to time we encounter unusual or
astonishing feats of construction and engineering, which can be achieved if
resources are made available
on an unusually lavish scale, and in ordinary
language there is a gap between the possible and the practicable.
<P>

47  	The plaintiff called the evidence of Mr Brian Bailey, a licensed
builder with long experience.  In his report he made comments
on the work
described in the letter of 14 December 1998 which show his view that renovation
was not necessary, and he supported no
more than painting. He said "I believe
the premises could stay as they are (except for minor painting) for another
five years." 
He also said "I note all of the above could be updated if the
lessors so wanted, but in no way would the lessee have to vacate the
premises
to do so.  My company could carry out any of the required work necessary during
the day as the restaurant does not operate
until after 5.30 pm and closes
Mondays. ... I believe my company could modify the premises with minor
disruption to the lessee and
maintain their `quiet enjoyment' of the premises
while doing so."  
<P>

48  	In oral evidence Mr Bailey said to the effect that if the
business was still operating while the work proposed to be done was
carried out
the builder would spend two to two and a half hours cleaning at the end of each
session of work.  He would expect the
cost to increase by approximately 30 or
40 per cent and the time would increase by 30 to 40 per cent.  He said "I would
not intend
to do all the areas up at the one time.  There would be areas left
for them to work, and then we could be doing other areas."  There
would have to
be arrangements including dust covers in areas under work, and limits on the
area used for seating.  As the ceiling
was pulled out there would be three or
four men pulling the ceiling out and then the ceiling would be lined the next
day.  He pointed
out that a different method could be adopted in which the
existing ceiling was left in place and a new ceiling was put in place under
it.
He would expect to work so that electricity supply was not interrupted.  He
described a method of work on renovation of the toilets
in which work would
proceed progressively and some toilet would always be available; and this work
would not take longer than three
days.  Mr Bailey accepted that stripping the
ceiling plaster is a messy job and would create dust.  He was cross-examined
about the
difficulties which might arise when removing fibro corrugated sheet
roofing at the rear of the premises; this roofing contains asbestos.
 However I
disregard that subject because, although the defendant does propose to do that
work, it is not part of the matter under
consideration because it was not
referred to in the details provided in the notice of 14 December 1998.  He
accepted that it would
be easier and cheaper to do the work if vacant
possession were obtained, but he did not have a preference as he would charge
more
if restaurant trade continued.
<P>

49  	In evidence the plaintiff described her trading routine; the
shop trades between 5.30 pm and midnight, and sometimes later,
from Tuesday to
Sunday each week.  If a public holiday falls on a Monday the shop trades then.
The plaintiff and the chef usually
arrive at about 3 pm and other staff arrive
later, until 6pm.  Pizzas are prepared in the pizza oven at the front of the
shop, and
pasta and veal dishes are prepared in the kitchen area; in the usual
working method there is a pizza chef and also a kitchen chef.
 The plaintiff
contemplated that she would continue to work if builders were coming and
working on the premises, although she might
have to cover up part of her usual
restaurant or other working area.
<P>

50  	The defendant called the evidence of Mr Chris Brown, a licensed
builder with significant experience, although not for as long
as Mr Bailey.  Mr
Brown's building company entered into a contract with the defendant to perform
renovations on 17 March 1999 relating
to a Scope of Works which corresponds
generally although not exactly with the works in the letter of 14 December
1998; the demolition
and extension of the building were not included in that
scope of works and the contract price was $48,600.  He rescinded the contract
as work did not commence on the contracted date 1 July 1999.  In evidence he
said "You couldn't operate food preparation business
while you were demolishing
the ceilings."  In his description of his proposed working methods for
replacing the ceiling, electric
power would be disconnected before work was
done, the ceiling would be stripped, then the roughing-in or chasing for new
electric
power would be carried out, then the new ceilings would be erected,
then the electrical work would be fitted out.  Electrical trades
and ceiling
trades could be accommodated so as to work more or less at the same time with
give-and-take.  He had experience of carrying
out building works on shops and
restaurants while the tenants were still in situ; in his experience it is
possible to do the works
while the tenants remain in by juggling and
accommodating working hours.  He said "... <i>when the work was being done in
the kitchen you would not be able to do any preparation in that area for food,
or if you did, your
hours of work would be that reduced that you would only
probably be getting an effective 2 hours of work done a day</i>." At t.22:
<P>

<i>"Q.	So it is much more convenient to have everybody out and you just get an
open go at it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes."</i>
<P>

51  	Mr Brown further said (t.22 to t.23):
<P>

<i>Q.	I think you answered `Both yes and no'.  What problems as a builder would
you see, or expect to experience having to do the work
with the tenant in
possession?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Your problems are doing the demolition around existing fittings that
could be damaged as you pull down the ceiling.  An awful lot
of dust and debris
is likely to be in the ceiling as you demolish it.  Ceilings of that vintage
tend to not be the easiest done in
one piece, sometimes you will get a small
section, sometimes you will pull half the ceiling down.  Then you have the
cleaning up
factor which would have to be taken into account every afternoon,
whereas if you had vacant possession you could get in basically
and strip the
whole ting and worry about the cleaning up process afterwards.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are there any occupational hazards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There would be occupational hazards.  In that part of the floor or with
the floor coverings up you would have to make sure there
were no areas where
the tenants or customers could trip, that everything was sealed and safe from
all the other trades, being electrical
and plumbing.  It would be quite an
onerous additional load on your work load to make it, to tidy up and make it
safe every afternoon.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you also indicated that working in the kitchen that you may only have
an effective two hours work a day?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How much longer would the job take to do?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I think I would say it would add about 75 per cent of the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And cost?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would say about 70 per cent to the cost.</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  Q.  If you did have vacant possession, what time span would the
work be expected to take?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I, I think I put eight weeks on my contract for the time for the work to
be taken.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And if you had to work around a tenant on the ground floor, what time
span would you expect the work to take?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would think 16 weeks." </i>
<P>

52  	Later evidence shows that in special circumstances and with
special measures he could achieve shorter working time, and he
said (t.25):
<P>

<i>"Q.	And I take it when you told the Court that if you have to work around a
tenant on the ground floor it wouldn't matter if that
tenant was Mr Savelle,
for argument purposes, or the plaintiff, you could more or less double whatever
the time was for vacant possession
work?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	But you would need vacant possession of some portion of that time to be
able to do that."</i>
<P>

53  	The plaintiff also called the evidence of Mr James Alan
MacGillivray an architect of long experience.  His evidence first dealt
with
the times required for carrying out the work, and its force is qualified
because he has not carried out proper inspections or
prepared plans.  He
expressed the view that vacant possession would be required for the work
proposed to be carried out, particularly
on the ground floor where the food
preparation and sales business is conducted.  The force of this view is limited
because it was
expressed in relation to paragraph 9 of the affidavit of Mr
Savelle, the principal of the defendant, which set out the work proposed
and
included work not specified in the letter of 14 December 1998, including
removing the rear wall and extending the premises. 
This difficulty persists
throughout my consideration of the application of Mr MacGillivray's evidence to
the issues before me; he
directed himself to more extensive works which might
involve, for example, replacing the wooden floors, as well as demolition of
the
rear wall and extension of the building.  When cross-examination (at t.31) took
him to the parts of the work which are relevant
he said to the effect that he
had been directed to the terms of Mr Savelle's affidavit.  His view as to the
need for vacant possession
was exemplified by reference to Mr Savelle's Item
(b), in which if the timber floor boards of the first floor were not in good
order
they were to be removed and replaced with a concrete floor.  This would
be a far more extensive exercise than that referred to in
the notice.  It was
however relevant that Mr MacGillivray said, of a number of items in the notice,
to the effect that the job could
be done without vacant possession but it would
be extremely difficult (t31) and exemplified that as follows:
<P>

<i>"A.	There is some worrying issues, just pick on the ceiling, pulling the
ceiling out, ground floor ceiling.  We have got a restaurant
in there - I don't
know what we will find when we pull the ceiling off, I know that there is dust
in there.  I have learnt just recently
that the dust in these ceilings contains
lead.  I am quite sure that the council would have a lot of input into that
situation where
you have got a situation of health problems, health danger
with, just on that one instance, the led that is in the dust that's in
the
ceilings, getting over food or food preparation areas.  There is other issues
that arise.  It is a building of the 1950's vintage.
 Timbers - it's probably a
timber floor, I haven't been in it, I don't know - if it is a timber floor and
built in the 50's it would
be quite likely that it's got vinyl tiles in there.
It's probably likely that it has got vinyl tiles on the floor, vinyl tiles
contain
asbestos and you would need men in plastic suits cleaning the place up.
Again that would be a hazard to the preparation of food and
trying to work
around it."</i>
<P>

54  	In appraising the force of this passage I have to remember that
there is in fact no evidence in the proceedings that the dust
in the ceilings
contains lead, and no evidence that there are vinyl tiles on a floor or that
vinyl tiles contain asbestos.  Mr MacGillivray,
who has not inspected the
premises at all, was speaking of potential hazards which might be encountered,
and not of hazards which
have been established to exist.  That there are
potentially such hazards has some relevance for deciding what is practicable,
but
very little force.
<P>

55  	Mr Savelle the principal of the defendant described in evidence
what he would want to do.  "... what I want to do is put a
Bobcat through the
front of it and carry it all the way up the back."  To my mind it is quite
clear that the work described in the
notice can be done practicably without
using a bulldozer to clear everything away.
<P>

56  	I turn to assess what findings I should make on subs.35(4).  To
my mind the work described in the notice would inherently be
very difficult to
accommodate with continued operation of the plaintiff's business.  The work
described would not be carried on with
a view to continuing the use of the
premises for the plaintiff's business; it would be carried out so as to equip
the premises for
a completely different use.  The opening words of the
description in the notice "to completely gut the premises" are rather dramatic
but they do not in fact convey much which can be comprehended about what the
work is to be; that is to be understood from the later
details.  The work of
installing a new shop front could easily be managed so as to cause very little
disturbance with continuing
business, as the new shop front would be
pre-fabricated off-site, and could be installed in the course of an ordinary
working day.
 The installation of new electrical wiring, involving chasing
wiring into walls, and the installation of new plumbing works would
involve
very considerable difficulty and inconvenience for the conduct of the
plaintiff's business while the works were proceeding.
 The likelihood is that
the plaintiff's business would be interrupted for several days by new
electrical wiring and new plumbing
works.  The removal of the ceilings and
fixing new ceilings would create very large difficulties for the conduct of the
plaintiff's
business.  A great deal of dust and mess would necessarily be
created by pulling down old ceilings.  The whole of the premises would
be not
capable of being used for several days; it does not seem to me to be realistic
to suppose that the work site could be cleaned
up before completion of the work
and that the premises could be put into position where a pizza bar and
restaurant could be carried
out, with the work of removing and refixing the
ceiling still uncompleted.  The dust and filth arising would be simply
inconsistent
with food preparation, and with conduct of shop selling food or a
restaurant, and the incompatibility would continue for some days
as a
minimum.
<P>

57  	The removal of all kitchen equipment on the ground floor is of
course altogether inconsistent with the continuance of the plaintiff's
business.
<P>

58  	The work to install new toilet facilities would be a
considerable inconvenience but could be manageable by arranging the work
progressively so that some toilet was always available.
<P>

59  	Overall the work described could be performed without first
completely removing the plaintiffs and her business , but the business
would be
disrupted for weeks or months and stopped it completely for days at a time.
The costs and time involved would be greatly
increased, variously estimated at
between 30 and 40 percent and at 70 percent more cost and at 70 percent more
and twice the time.
 At the end of the works the building as renovated would be
completely unsuited for conduct of the plaintiff's business, without
any
internal fixings, without a kitchen and in a suitable state for the conduct of
a real estate office.
<P>

60  	My finding on the facts is that the work described is
substantial renovation that cannot be carried out practicably without
vacant
possession of the shop.  In my finding the defendant in the letter of 14
December 1998 provided the plaintiff with details
of the proposed work
sufficient to indicate a genuine proposal to carry out the works within a
reasonably practicable time after
termination.
<P>

61  	It is not my view open to contention by the lessee whether the
lessor's decision to demolish, repair, renovate or reconstruct
the building is
reasonable or appropriate; it is sufficient if there is a genuine proposal.
Nor in my opinion is it open to debate
whether the lessor could in some way
modify the lessor's proposal so as to continue to accommodate the lessee after
the premises
have been demolished, repaired, renovated or reconstructed.  The
opportunity to break a lease, retake possession and take advantage
of the
demolition clause is a contractual opportunity made available to the lessor by
the terms of the lease itself, including the
provisions notionally incorporated
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35</a>, it is not injurious to the lessor's position whether the lessor has
decided to take that advantage, and it is not relevant that
the lessor has in
view occupying the premises itself, or selling them after reconstruction, or
leasing them again, even if the lease
should be to business similar to the
lessee's.  The demolition clause is a reality of the party's relationship, and
so is its potential
operation to end the lease.
<P>

62  	It was contended that the duty of good faith referred to
<b>Alcatel</b> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> operating together make it
impermissible to use the break clause when the underlying purpose is to put
another occupant into possession.
 In my view this lease includes the break
clause and it is not possible to say that by exercising rights under it the
lessor is stepping
outside the contemplated relationship.
<P>

63  	The plaintiff's counsel contended that I should not give
judgment for possession on the Cross-claim because it was said that
the
cross-claimant did not comply with several provisions of the Rules of Court.
One provision referred to was Pt.7 r.8 but upon
the evidence no person other
than the cross-defendant is in occupation of the premises; in particular there
is no basis for finding
that Mr La Grazia, who is referred to in evidence as
Mrs Blackler's business associate and as the chef of the restaurant, is in
occupation.
 Counsel also referred to Pt.40 r.11 which does not apply as the
cross-defendant has participated in the hearing, and to Pt.42 r.4
the only
relevant operation of which is its requirement in subrule (2) of leave to issue
a writ of possession, which I will consider
forthwith on publishing these
reasons. 
<P>

64  	Defendant's counsel told me that on the cross-claim the
defendant contended that damages for mesne profits should be assessed
to $450
per week being the current rental rate.  As the period to surrender of
possession is not yet known, and as there may be some
other damages question
relating to the interlocutory injunction, I prefer to leave all questions of
damages for further consideration.
<P>

65  	<b>Orders:</b>
<P>

<b>On the plaintiff's claim</b>
<P>

(1)	Give judgment for the defendant with costs.
<P>

<b>On the Cross-claim</b>
<P>

(2)	Declaration in terms of Claim 1
<P>

(3)	Dismiss Claim 2.
<P>

(4)	Judgment for possession as in Claim 3.
<P>

(5)	Reserve further consideration of questions of damages.
<P>

(6)	Order that the cross-defendant pay the cross-claimant's costs of the
Cross-claim.
