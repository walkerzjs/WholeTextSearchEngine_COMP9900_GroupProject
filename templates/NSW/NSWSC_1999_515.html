ORS</b>
<P>

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT  -  On costs</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  This matter has been relisted in order to
determine the outstanding issues as to costs of the proceedings.
<P>

<b>Boral</b>
<P>

2  	It has now been shown, in relation to the proceedings concerning
this party, that:
<P>

(a) On 6 April 1993 Boral, through its solicitors, made an offer to Taylor
&amp; Scott to bear its own costs of the proceedings
if they were discontinued
against it, and outlined the basis on which it contended that the proceedings
against it should fail.
<P>

(b) This offer was repeated in a Calderbank letter from Boral's solicitors to
Keddies dated 9 February 1995, in which Boral advised
that it intended to seek
costs upon an indemnity basis from that date, if this offer was not
accepted.
<P>

(c) On 22 August 1995 Boral's solicitors wrote to Hunt &amp; Hunt, drawing
attention to the fact that special leave to appeal from
the decision in<b>
O'Brien v Boral Roof Tiles</b> had been refused by the High Court, and repeated
the offer contained in the letter of 9 February 1995.
<P>

(d) On 12 December 1995 a letter was sent advising that the earlier offer
remained open and again giving notice of Boral's intention
to seek indemnity
costs.
<P>

(e) Mediation was attempted, unsuccessfully, on 29 May 1998. 
<P>

(f) On 18 November 1998 a further letter was sent to the plaintiff's current
solicitors, drawing attention to the very same matters
which led to the
proceedings ultimately being decided by me in favour of Mirvac and Boral, and
making a joint offer on behalf of
each of those parties to pay the plaintiff's
costs in the sum of $30,000 in return for a judgment in their favour
accompanied by
a deed of release and indemnity.  Express reference was made in
this letter to the decision in Calderbank.
<P>

(g)	On 4 February 1999 a further joint offer was made, this time by Mirvac's
solicitors, as set out below.
<P>

3  	In the light of those circumstances, Boral seeks an order for
costs on a party and party basis up to 6 April 1993, and upon
an indemnity
basis from that date, or at the latest from 18 November 1998.
<P>

<b>Mirvac</b>
<P>

4  	In relation to the proceedings against Mirvac, it was established
that:
<P>

(a) On 25 November 1993, that is the day after Keddies took over conduct of the
proceedings from Taylor &amp; Scott, a  without
prejudice offer was sent to the
former firm to settle the matter for $50,000, inclusive of costs.
<P>

(b) On 1 July 1998 a statement from Gordon Collis was served upon the
plaintiff's current solicitors, which underlined the problems
that the
plaintiff ultimately faced in establishing a claim against Mirvac and, I would
add, against the carpenters.
<P>

(c) As previously mentioned, on 18 November 1998 a joint offer of settlement
was made on behalf of both Mirvac and Boral.
<P>

(d) On 4 February 1999, that is on the third day of the trial, a letter was
sent to the plaintiff's solicitors by Mirvac's solicitors,
in which a joint
offer was made on behalf of Mirvac and Boral to pay their own costs in return
for a verdict in their favour and
entry into a deed of release and
indemnity.
<P>

5  	Mirvac seeks, in those circumstances, an order for costs upon a
party and party basis up to 25 November 1993 and upon an indemnity
basis from
that date or, alternatively, from 18 November 1998.
<P>

6  	By consent Mirvac and Boral do not seek any order for costs in
relation to the cross-claims between them.
<P>

<b>Taylor &amp; Scott</b>
<P>

7  	In relation to Taylor &amp; Scott, it was established that: 
<P>

(a) On 13 April 1995 a formal offer of compromise was forwarded to Keddies upon
the basis that they bear their own costs and that
a consent verdict be entered
in their favour.  This was accompanied by a letter detailing the basis on which
it was suggested that
the claim against Taylor &amp; Scott must fail, advising
that the offer was open for twenty-eight days, and asking that it be treated
in
accordance with the Calderbank principle.
<P>

(b) On 26 May 1995 this offer was, in substance, repeated in a letter to Hunt
&amp; Hunt, in which notice was given that if the
proceedings were pursued
unsuccessfully against Taylor &amp; Scott, then costs incurred henceforth would
be sought on an indemnity
or a solicitor and client basis.
<P>

(c) This offer was rejected by Hunt &amp; Hunt on 11 August 1995.
<P>

(d) On 24 April 1996 the solicitors for Taylor &amp; Scott again wrote to Hunt
&amp; Hunt, outlining in detail their case and advising
that they were still
prepared to settle on the basis of the offer of compromise, provided that
settlement was achieved within twenty-eight
days.  Again, notice was flagged of
an intention to seek costs on a solicitor and client or indemnity basis.
<P>

8  	In those circumstances Taylor &amp; Scott seek costs on a party
and party basis up to 13 April 1995 and upon an indemnity basis
from that
time.
<P>

<b>Keddies</b>
<P>

9  	In relation to Keddies, it was established that:
<P>

(a) On 28 February 1996 the solicitors for that firm wrote to Hunt &amp; Hunt,
making a without prejudice offer of $30,000, inclusive
of costs, in full and
final settlement of the matter, and setting out, in some detail, the problems
that they saw in the way of the
plaintiff's claim against them.
<P>

(b) This offer was effectively renewed by a reminder sent on 20 May 1996.
<P>

 (c) A counter offer was made on 15 July 1997 by the plaintiff's solicitors to
settle the proceedings for $280,000, inclusive of
costs.
<P>

(d) On 7 August 1997 Keddies' Solicitors, withdrew their earlier offer and on
27 August 1997 they rejected the plaintiff's counter
offer.  They seek an order
for costs on a party and party basis only.
<P>

10  	Section 76 (1) of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970</A> (NSW)
provides as follows:
<P>

"Subject to this Act and the rules and subject to any other Act -
<P>

(a) costs shall be in the discretion of the Court; 
<P>

(b) the Court shall have full power to determine
<P>

by whom and to what extent costs are to be paid; and
<P>

(c) the Court may order costs to be assessed on the basis set out in Division 6
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lpa1987179/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987</A> or on an indemnity
basis."
<P>

11  	The proceedings were commenced at a time when<b> Supreme Court
Rules</b> Pt 52 were in force.  Those rules were superseded effective from 1
July 1994 by<b> Supreme Court Rules</b> Pt 52A.
<P>

12  	It is not necessary to enter into any inquiry whether this
requires any difference of approach as to the costs of these proceedings
or any
part of them, since both sets of rules recognise the power of the Court to
order costs on an indemnity basis (Pt 52 r 28A
and Pt 52A r 37), and contain
similar provisions in relation to offers of compromise (Pt 52 r 17 (4) and (5)
and Pt 52A r 22 (4)
and (6)).  They provide, relevantly, that:
<P>

"Where a defendant has made an offer of compromise that is not accepted by the
plaintiff, and the plaintiff has obtained an order
or judgment that is not more
favourable to the plaintiff than the terms of the offer, then the plaintiff,
unless otherwise ordered,
is to be entitled to party and party costs up until
the day of the offer and the defendant is to be entitled to costs upon a party
and party basis thereafter."
<P>

13  	As Rolfe J observed in<b> Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal
Airports Corporation</b> (1996) 138 ALR 425, these rules do not expressly
accommodate the situation where a defendant has made an offer and the plaintiff
has failed entirely. Notwithstanding, his Honour held that there was a prime
face presumption that an order for indemnity costs should
be made, if an offer
of settlement was made, rejected and not bettered in litigation, unless the
party rejecting the offer establishes
that it was reasonable for it not to
accept the offer.  Prime face, his Honour held unreasonableness would depend
upon the failure
of the offeree to accept the offer. The discretion to order
indemnity costs, his Honour considered, should not be limited to those
cases
where there was no prospect of success, or where the rejection of the offer was
plainly unreasonable, or where there was an
element of misconduct on the part
of the offeree.
<P>

14  	With respect, I agree with the conclusion which his Honour
reached and with the analysis which led to that result. 
<P>

15  	The present case may be approached upon the basis that a
Calderbank letter is the equivalent of an offer of compromise and
that its
existence may properly enliven the discretion to  order indemnity costs.  The
present case is also one in which, so far
as Mirvac and Boral are concerned,
the principles described by Cole J, as he then was, in<b> State Authorities
Superannuation Board v Property Estates (Queensland) Pty Ltd</b> (Supreme Court
of New South Wales, 8 February 1991) and by Rogers CJ Comm D in<b> AWA Ltd v
Daniels</b> (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 8 October 1992) have particular
application.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff's claim against the primary parties (Mirvac and
Boral) was always very weak and that weakness was only confirmed
once the
decision of the Court of Appeal in<b> O'Brien</b> was handed down, and once it
became known what evidence Mr Collis would give if called as a witness.  Each
of Mirvac and Boral pointed
out, in clear terms, the pitfalls in the way of the
plaintiff, and each took sensible and commercial endeavours to be released from
the litigation.  I cannot see any reason why they should be burdened with the
recovery of costs only up-on a party and party basis,
once they had brought
these matters to attention and had delivered a Calderbank offer.
<P>

17  	Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of Mirvac
on a party and party basis up to 18 November 1998, and upon
an indemnity basis
thereafter.
<P>

18  	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of Boral on a party and
party basis up to 22 August 1995, and upon an indemnity basis
thereafter.
<P>

19  	The position in relation to Taylor &amp; Scott and Keddies is
somewhat more complicated, in that each firm, to some extent
at least,
encouraged the plaintiff to pursue litigation which, upon my assessment, was
bound to fail.  In the case of Taylor &amp;
Scott, they encouraged action
against Mirvac and Boral, and also against the carpenters.  In the case of
Keddies, they encouraged
continuance of the proceedings against Mirvac and
Boral, and also advised action against Taylor &amp; Scott for not joining the
carpenters
in time.
<P>

20  	Even looked at in the most favourable light possible, the
discharge by each firm of its retainer can only be described as dilatory
and as
unsatisfactory from a professional point of view.  However, at least three
problems stand in the way of the plaintiff in seeking
the orders that he seeks:
namely, that they be required to pay the costs that he now has to pay to Mirvac
and Boral and, additionally,
or alternatively, that they be deprived of their
costs of defending the proceedings he has brought against them.
<P>

21  	The problems are as follows:
<P>

(a) The proceedings were continued against Mirvac and Boral, and against Taylor
&amp; Scott and against Keddies, by two other firms
of solicitors, once they
had ceased to act for the plaintiff. 
<P>

(b) There is no evidence before me as to what advice they gave to the plaintiff
in relation to pursuing any aspect of the proceedings
or in relation to their
possible settlement, and
<P>

(c) In each instance they had consulted counsel from time to time concerning
the proceedings and may be assumed in the absence of
evidence to the contrary
to have acted in accordance with their advice.
<P>

22  	There is a power to order costs against successful parties but
the Court must be satisfied that, in the particular circumstances,
it is
appropriate to do so.  For example, such an order may be made where they have
misconducted themselves in relation to the events
the subject of the
proceedings, or in the institution or conduct of the proceedings, or in
encouraging the other party to believe
in the strength of the case that was
brought against them.  These principles are discussed in<b> Ritter v
Godfrey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%202%20KB%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 2 KB 47</a> and<b> Jamal v Secretary Department of Health</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20252" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 252</a> at 271-272.
<P>

23  	The argument on costs cannot be converted into an inquiry
whether Taylor &amp; Scott or Keddies were negligent in advising
the plaintiff
to begin, or to continue, the proceedings against Mirvac or Boral, or whether
Keddies was negligent in encouraging
the plaintiff to commence proceedings
against Taylor &amp; Scott.
<P>

24  	On the state of the evidence before me, I am unable to find that
there was that degree of misconduct or encouragement as would
justify an order
that either party pay the costs of the plaintiff, either by way of a
reimbursement of the costs that he must now
pay to Mirvac and to Boral, or
those which he has incurred in bringing the proceedings against them.  
<P>

25  	Each did flag, for the plaintiff, the problems he was likely to
face in the proceedings so far as they related to them.  However,
neither,
while acting for the plaintiff, seems to have adequately assessed the aspect
that became critical if negligence was to be
established against Taylor &amp;
Scott:  namely, whether there was any reasonable prospect of maintaining an
action against the carpenters,
or of gaining access to the insurance policy.
It was that aspect that halted progress for an extended period, to the
considerable
disadvantage of the plaintiff, both while Taylor &amp; Scott had
the conduct of the proceedings and when attempts were made later
by Keddies to
institute proceedings against them.
<P>

26  	Absent the offers, and the waiver of their own fees in respect
of the periods during which they acted respectively for the
plaintiff, I would,
in the exercise of my discretion, have declined to make any order for costs in
the proceedings so far as they
concern the claims brought against each firm.
However, once sued, they did endeavour to resolve the proceedings and to point
out
the problems in the way of the plaintiff.  It was his election to proceed
with the claims and it is, in my view, appropriate that
the costs should follow
the event but only on a party and party basis.
<P>

27  	Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of Taylor
&amp; Scott and of Keddies, confined to the claims brought
against them for
negligence, on a party and party basis.
<P>

28  	I grant a stay in relation to the costs orders for twenty-eight
days.
