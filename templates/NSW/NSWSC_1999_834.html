<b>JUDGMENT	(Leave to appeal decision of costs assessor)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b> The appellant by summons filed 2 March 1999 seeks
leave to appeal against the decision of costs assessor, Mr David Harold Cohen
made
on 3 February 1999.  The appellant relies on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal
Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW).  The appellant relied on the affidavit of
Roderick James Watt sworn 9 April 1999 and affidavit of William Watson sworn
14
April 1999.  The respondent relied on the affidavit of June Vile sworn 9 June
1999.  
<P>

2  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (the
Act) provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in
accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of the
Court to
appeal to the Court against the determination of the application made by a
costs assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A party to an application relating to costs payable as a result of an
order made by a court or a tribunal may, in accordance with
the rules of the
court or tribunal, seek leave of the court or tribunal to appeal to the court
or tribunal against the determination
of the application made by a costs
assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Supreme Court or court or tribunal may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine the
appeal.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or
evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the
original proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

3  	In seeking to appeal under s 208M rather than s 208L, the
applicant requires material, other than, or in addition to a point
of law in
order to be successful.  This section provides that such an application
requires leave in accordance with the rules of
the court.
<P>

4  	I have read Master Greenwood's decision in <b><u>Busuttil v
Holder &amp; Anor</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 9 August 1996).  In particular I
agree with his comments on the applicable test for leave.  He says:
<P>

<b>"Thus whilst each application for leave to appeal is to be determined on its
merits and I heed the statement of the High Court in
Adam P Brown Male Fashions
Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 170</a> that it is "unnecessary and
unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria" for the grant of leave to
appeal, as the circumstances
of different cases are "infinitely various"" I can
see nothing in what is before me that leads me to a conclusion that I ought to
look to the </b>
<P>

<b>question of leave other than to apply the criteria of an obvious error on
the face of the record and substantial injustice done to
the appellant if the
determination of the costs assessor is allowed to stand."  </b>
<P>

5  	The assessor's certificate dated 3 February 1999 determined that
the sum of $15,808.72 was the fair and reasonable amount payable
by the
plaintiffs instead of $18,458.47 as submitted.  The bill of costs related to an
appeal to the Court of Appeal.  This was a
reduction of $2,649.75.  The
plaintiff has paid $9,400 and the sum of $6,408.72 remains outstanding.
<P>

6  	It was not submitted that the costs assessor did not conduct the
costs assessment in accordance with the procedures laid down
in the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal
Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW).  The plaintiff conceded that the items that it
submitted were excessive were those in which the costs assessor had a
discretion.  The plaintiffs' case at its highest was that the professional
costs should have been reduced from $8,566.04 to $5,916.29
(a further reduction
of $2,469.75) and disbursements should also have been reduced.
<P>

7  	The plaintiffs' counsel referred to some specific items which
were allowed by the costs assessor which he submitted were either
not allowable
on a party/party assessment or excessive.  According to the plaintiff the
preparation fees charged by counsel, the
costs of the costs assessor preparing
the party/party bill ($725) were not allowable and the amount allowed for care,
skill and consideration
was too high.
<P>

8  	It is my view that the sum of $15,808.75 is a fair and reasonable
amount for the costs of an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
 The only possible
error of principle may be that the costs assessor allowed the costs of the
costs consultant to prepare the bill
of costs but this item amounts to the sum
of $725.  I have reached the conclusion that there is no obvious error on the
face of the
record.  Nor has there been a substantial injustice done to the
appellant if the costs assessor's decision is allowed to stand. 
For these
reasons leave to appeal is refused.
<P>

9  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Leave to appeal is refused..
<P>

(2)	The summons filed 1 March 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The appellant is to pay the respondent's costs as agreed or assessed.
