<P>

FRIDAY 26 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>11513/1999</u>	<u>ROBERT GILBERT COSHOTT v WOOLLAHRA MUNICIPAL
COUNCIL</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff brought proceedings in the Court of Appeal against
the defendant.  The appeal was set down for hearing.  The proceedings
were
settled shortly prior to the hearing date.  A consent order was made which
required the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs
of the appeal.
<P>

2  	The defendant prepared a Bill of Costs.  It claimed costs and
disbursements in a total amount of $19,618.78.  It is a detailed
document
containing some 155 items (of which 142 were items of profit costs).  The
profit costs were in the order of $8,000.  The
disbursements were in the order
of $11,000 (mainly counsels' fees).  The bill provided information as to each
profit cost item (it
gave the item number, the date, a narrative of the work
done (including a figure for the time engaged) and the amount charged).
<P>

3  	The defendant applied to this Court for assessment of the costs.
The application was referred to a Costs Assessor (Mr Bartos).
 He proceeded
with assessment of the costs.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff provided him with a Notice of Objections (there was
an objection to $12,194.32 of the bill).  The defendant provided
the Costs
Assessor with a Notice of Concessions and Specific Replies.  Correspondence
passed between the Costs Assessor and the parties.
<P>

5  	On 31 May 1999, the Costs Assessor issued a Certificate of
Determination.  He assessed the sum of $18,868.72 as a fair and reasonable
amount of costs to be paid by the plaintiff.  The certificate was accompanied
by other documentation.  One document was in the following
terms:-
<P>

"It may assist the parties to note that:-
<P>

1.	The assessment of costs includes the filing fee of 
<P>

$194.25.
<P>

2.	It is my practice to allow fax and photocopying charges at $1 per page for
the first five pages and subsequent pages at 20 cents
per page.  I have allowed
such charges on that basis.  I do not propose to list the individual items
affected and the amended charges.
<P>

3.	I have accepted or partially accepted some of the respondents' objections.
The items which have been disallowed or reduced are
set out in the Appendix.  I
have indicated my reasons.
<P>

4.	The applicant claimed extra $25.00 in relation to item 130.  I did not allow
this additional claim, as it seemed to me that the
initial claim for this item
was appropriate.
<P>

5.	In relation to the argument about the use of "blocks of six minutes", as is
obvious from my assessment I have accepted the applicant's
submissions in this
regard, except in relation to some attendances as noted in the Appendix."
<P>

The other document was the Appendix.  The Appendix identified the items that
had either been disallowed or reduced.  It specified
the amount either
disallowed or reduced and set forth the reason for the disallowance or
reduction.
<P>

6  	On 28 June 1999, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings by the
filing of a Summons.  He seeks relief pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal
Profession Act 1987</a> (the Act).  This provision provides a restricted avenue of
appeal against a decision of a Costs Assessor ("as to a matter of law
arising
in the proceedings to determine the application").
<P>

7  	The appeal was heard on 2 November 1999.  The plaintiff has sworn
an affidavit.  The defendant has relied upon an affidavit
sworn by Mr O'Rourke.
The affidavit material provides the documentation that was made available to
the Costs Assessor.
<P>

8  	The submissions of the plaintiff raise three areas of challenge
to the decision of the Costs Assessor.  The first area was said
to be that the
assessor had allowed a large number of items claimed on the basis of 6 minute
minimums or on the basis of 6 minute
units.  The second area was said to be
that the assessor did not give reasons.  The third area was said to be that the
assessor allowed
counsels' fees on an indemnity basis (this was in fact a
somewhat erroneous presentation of a contention that he erred in allowing
the
fees in the full amount claimed).
<P>

9  	It is common ground that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpaaa1998454/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Amendment (Costs
Assessment) Act 1998</a> and the Legal Profession Amendment (Costs Assessment)
Regulation 1999 do not have application to the matter in dispute in these
proceedings.
<P>

10  	It was common ground that as a matter of general law the Costs
Assessor was obliged to give reasons in the sense indicated
in the authorities.
The judicial observations express a need to give specified detail in relation
to items that have been reduced.
<P>

11  	It was plainly erroneous to submit that the Costs Assessor had
failed to give reasons.  The only challenge open to the plaintiff
was as to the
sufficiency of the disclosure of the reasoning process.  The argument
ultimately put was that he had failed to express
the reasoning process for the
allowing of the six minute block items and the counsels' fees.  In my view, the
Costs Assessor has
sufficiently disclosed his reasoning process.
<P>

12  	What will be required by way of expression of reasoning process
will vary from case to case.  It must be borne in mind also
that some
deficiency in the expression of the reasoning process may not of itself lead to
a disturbing of the Costs Assessor's decision.
 Some good basis for the
disturbing of it must be shown.
<P>

13  	In this case, the submissions made to the Costs Assessor clearly
identified the issues raised as to the matters of the six
minute blocks and
counsels' fees.  It is obvious from the documentation produced by the Costs
Assessor that in allowing items he
was accepting submissions made on behalf of
the defendant and not accepting the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff
in respect
of these matters and that the items were allowed as they had been
assessed as fair and reasonable.
<P>

14  	The onus rests on the plaintiff to demonstrate an entitlement to
relief under the Act.  In my view the plaintiff has fallen
well short of
discharging that onus.
<P>

15  	I am not satisfied that there was error on the part of the Costs
Assessor in allowing either the items claimed on a six minute
block basis or
the disbursements for counsels' fees.  It seems to me that the Costs Assessor
reached a result which was open on the
material that was available to him.  In
any event, I am not satisfied that the challenge made in respect of these items
involved
any matter of law.
<P>

16  	There was an attempt to present the first area of challenge as
involving a matter of law.  Reference was made to <u>Moray v Lane</u> (Allen J,
unreported, 26 February 1993) and <u>Re Morris Fletcher &amp; Cross' Bill of
Costs</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%202%20Qd%20R%20228" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 2 Qd. R 228.</a>  In each of those cases, observation was made as
to the potential for error where a minimum charge is imposed.  I am not
persuaded
that these observations give rise to any matter of law which can be
called in aid by the plaintiff to disturb the decision of the
Costs
Assessor.
<P>

17  	The Summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of
the Summons.
