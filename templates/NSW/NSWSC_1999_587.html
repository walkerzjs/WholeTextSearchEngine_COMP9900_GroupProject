WEDNESDAY 16 JUNE 1999
<P>

<u>20840/1996</u>	<u>JOHN BERNARD RAE v THE COMMONWEALTH OF </u>
<P>

<u>AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This proceeding is one of the many arising out of the collision
between the HMAS Melbourne and the HMAS Voyager on 10 February
1964.  The
process was filed on 8 August 1996.  A Notice of Motion was filed on the same
day.  It sought an extension of the relevant
limitation period.
<P>

2  	The Notice of Motion was heard on 10 June 1999.  It commenced as
an opposed application.
<P>

3  	The evidence placed before the Court fell within a small compass.
The plaintiff has sworn an affidavit.  Certain exhibits were
tendered.  The
plaintiff was asked a few questions in cross-examination.  The defendant did
not adduce any evidence.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff was born on 14 December 1942.  He became a member
of the Royal Australian Navy on 15 February 1960.  At the time
of the collision
he was a member of the crew of HMAS Melbourne.  He was on the flight deck at
the time.  Paragraph 6 of his affidavit
provides a version of what he observed
at the time of and following the collision.  He was not cross-examined on this
version.
<P>

5  	He was discharged from the Navy on 14 February 1969.  His other
post-collision history can be gleaned from the affidavit.  Save
for particular
mention of certain matters, it is not necessary to repeat history details in
this judgment.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff's present problems are a psychiatric disorder, a
substance abuse disorder and a heart condition.  He became aware
that he was
suffering from a psychiatric disorder in 1995 after consulting with a general
practitioner (Dr Peachey) and a specialist
(Dr Pohlen).  On 20 January 1998, he
suffered a heart attack.  He came under the care of Dr Hill (a cardiologist).
Later in January
1998, he became aware that in the opinion of Dr Hill the
psychiatric disorder had caused him to greatly increase his smoking and
drinking and that all of these conditions were either a contributing factor to
or cause of his heart condition.  This was the first
time that he had knowledge
that his heart condition was related to the collision.
<P>

7  	Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act
1969</a></u>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a> prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> unless the
Court is satisfied of the matters listed in (a) and (b) of subsection (1)
thereof.  These are threshold requirements to
the making of an order.  When the
threshold requirements have been satisfied, there is a discretionary power to
grant relief.
<P>

8  	At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant made no
submissions in opposition to the granting of the relief sought by the
plaintiff.  Although by that time the application had become unopposed, the
defendant indicated to the Court that a judgment was
still required.
<P>

9  	The evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff has met the relevant
threshold requirements.  In the circumstances of this case,
I have reached the
decision that it is just and reasonable to make the order sought and that such
an order should be made in this
case.
<P>

10  	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded
in the Statement of Claim up to and including 8 August 1996.
 It is common
ground that the costs of the application should be costs in the cause.  I make
that order.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
