<b>JUDGMENT (On application for directions to the jury- see page 57 of
transcript)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   Address by counsel concluded shortly after 4pm yesterday
afternoon. I had earlier ruled that the usual course and
order of addresses
would apply and thus plaintiff's counsel would not have what was then sought,
namely a right of reply to the jury
(DLJT: 12 19 February 1999)
<P>

2	A document has been prepared by Mr Reynolds S.C. for the plaintiff setting
out 17 directions sought by the plaintiff following
Mr Nicholas' address to the
jury. Whilst not seeking to avoid addressing the 17 points, the discussion
between Mr Reynolds and Mr
Nicholas and myself on the record will indicate that
each of the matters has generally been confronted and I have indicated, where
I
considered it appropriate, that I would give specific directions.  Thus I do
not propose to lose time at this stage in dealing
with them one by one. 
<P>

3	The plaintiff has the benefit of having made the application for the
directions and I invite him and his counsel and the defendant
and its counsel
to listen to my summing-up.
