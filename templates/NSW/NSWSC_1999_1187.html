<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: I am asked to rule in advance on a body of
evidence proposed to be led for the plaintiff.  The witness from whom
the
evidence is to be led is disabled, and it would be an inconvenience for her to
be in and out of the witness box.
<P>

2   	A statement of principle that has been referred to again
and again in this litigation is that set out at page 513 E of the
judgment of
Hunt J in <b><i>Hughes v Mirror Newspapers Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 504</a>
where his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"Mr Peters could give evidence of the precise words used by some other
person out of court which demonstrated that person's contemporaneous
reaction
to the publication of the matter complained of."</i>
<P>

3   	The evidence sought to be led, it is submitted, falls
within that category.  It is proposed to lead from the witness who, as
I
presently understand it, occupied an administrative office in the Council of
Civil Liberties, that within a short time after the
publication of the first
matter complained of, she and the office of the Council received, respectively,
telephone calls and letters
demonstrating the callers' and correspondents'
contemporaneous, and also particularly adverse, reaction to the plaintiff.  In
respect
of each type of communication the caller and the letter writer, or the
callers and letter writers, was or were anonymous.
<P>

4   	In respect of the letters received, evidence will be given
that they were destroyed and thus the witness will give evidence
as to the
contents.  Assuming that the letters are "<i>unavailable" </i>documents, as
defined in section clause 5 of the dictionary to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>,</i> in
relation to each such unavailable document, it would be, in my view, a
"<i>document in question" </i>as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.46</a> (1) in respect of which
evidence may be adduced pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> (4) (b) by oral evidence of its
contents.  The opening words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> (4) are:  "<i>A party may adduce evidence
of the contents of a document in question that is not available to the
party</i>" is to be read disjunctively to the balance of the introductory
paragraph in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 4.</a>
<P>

5   	In circumstances where, assuming contemporaneity and
linkage with the relevant publication, an identified caller has a communication
with someone in the position of this witness, or a letter identifies its author
to that person, and the letter exists, it would seem
to me that that evidence
would be admissible in accordance with the <b><i>Hughes</i></b> principle I
have identified.  The mere fact that the caller was not identified and the
author of the letter not identified, seems
to be an insufficient basis for the
exclusion of the evidence as a matter of principle, provided all other
components of it satisfy
the statement by Hunt J.  It is evidence of the very
kind, one would have thought, to which his Honour was directing his attention
at the passage cited.
<P>

6   	On that basis, subject of course as to how the witness
evidence comes out, but subject to one other matter, I have come to
the view
that it is admissible.
<P>

7   	It is argued by the defendant, however, that I should
exercise my discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> on the basis that
the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence
might be unfairly prejudicial to
the defendant.  The probative value of the
evidence is infected, it is said by, first, anonymity and, second, by reason of
the absence
of the documents in the case of the letters.  No material would be
available to determine how many correspondents there were, on
the assumption
that there was more than one.  Reference was made, in the course of
submissions, by myself, to an obsessive person
who might write hundreds of
letters.
<P>

8   	By reason of those qualities, of course, the ability of the
defendant to test what I will describe as the strength of the presumably
disparaging content, both of the calls and the letters, is affected, as well as
the number.
<P>

9   	The witness herself can be tested as to her recollection,
and in the end weight or lack of it given to the testimony she gives.
 By its
very nature, the evidence will not have the probative value that evidence in
relation to identified letters, existing letters
and identified callers
evidence would have. I am not persuaded that its potential probative value or
its probative value is outweighed
substantially by the danger of unfavourable
prejudice to the defendant, given its capacity thoroughly to test this witness
as to
her recollection and the contents.  I propose to allow it, subject to all
the other matters to which I have referred being established
in her testimony.
I will add that no authority really one way or the other has been cited in the
context of a defamation case, apart
from the principle stated in
<b><i>Hughes</i></b>.  <b><i>Hughes </i></b>case, as I understand it, was
concerned with the evidence of Mr Peters in the context of talk-back radio
program.  To that extent
the present point is novel.
