<b>50278/1996 - GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES PTY LIMITED  v  LEGION TELECALL PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	By a Summons issued on 24 December 1996, which was amended
by an Amended Summons filed in Court on 15 February 1999, Global
Network
Services Pty Limited, ("Global"), for which Mr P.LeG. Brereton of Senior
Counsel and Mr M.K. Meek of Counsel appeared, sued
Legion Telecall Pty Limited,
("Legion"), for which Mr J.W.J. Stevenson of Counsel appeared.  Global alleged,
under the heading "Nature
of Dispute", that it has been, at all material times,
a provider of telephone psychic reading services by making available
astrologers,
star card readers, fortune tellers and similar services to members
of the public on "190" telephone numbers, i.e. telephone numbers
commencing
with those numbers; that Legion has been, at all material times, a service
provider of telephone lines to handle premium
rate audiotex services; and that
it contracted with Legion to provide psychic reading services on telephone
lines supplied by Legion.
 It sued Legion for damages for breach of the terms
of the contract, which, it alleged:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	obliged Legion to direct all 190 psychic and psychic-related call
processing requests to Global (with the exception of the one-off
Athena
Starwoman - Woman's Day Star Cards Promotion); and</b>
<P>

<b>  (b)	entitled Global to receive the residual moneys from the bad debt
retention levy of 20% charged by Telecom, remitted by Telecom
to Legion after a
period of 7 months in respect of services promoted by Global using Legion
solely as service bureau."</b>
<P>

2   	Global identified the issues likely to arise as:-
<P>

<b>"1.	Whether Legion directed all 190 psychic and psychic-related call
processing requests (with the exception of the one-off Athena
Starwoman -
Woman's Day Star Cards Promotion) through Global's psychic call centre, and, if
not, then the number and value of the
190 psychic and psychic-related call
processing requests which Legion did not direct through Global's psychic call
centre.</b>
<P>

<b>2.	In particular, whether Legion has redirected calls on the Psychic Express
service to Legion's own Mystic Meg 190 line, and if so
the quantity and value
of calls so diverted.</b>
<P>

<b>3.	Whether Legion has received from Telecom residual moneys from Telecom's
bad debt retention levy, in respect of services promoted
by Global using Legion
solely as service bureau, and if so the amount of such moneys."</b>
<P>

The principal issue was whether Legion had the obligation referred to in (a)
above, it not being in dispute that there was no diversion
as alleged in
paragraph 2, save for a period after about 15 December 1995, and that Global
was entitled to recover certain residual
moneys, the amounts being $4,896 and
$10,868.53 respectively.
<P>

<b>The Pleadings</b>
<P>

3   	In its Summary of Contentions, Global pleaded in paragraph
C1 that it entered into a written Agreement with Legion on 30 November
1994 for
the provision of a live psychic reading premium rate service on the 190
InfoCall Network.  Legion admitted the entry into
the Agreement on the date
specified, relied on its terms as if they were set out in full, "but save as
aforesaid" denied the Agreement
contained the terms alleged in paragraph C1(f),
and otherwise did not admit the allegations in that paragraph.
<P>

4   	It pleaded that pursuant to the Agreement, Legion undertook
to provide access to telephone lines to handle premium rate audiotex
services
to be operated by live operators provided by Global, with Legion outswitching
call traffic to an operator bureau operated
by Global; and to supply Global
with call figures and operator call reports relating to the services monthly or
at such longer period
as may be necessary due to circumstances beyond Legion's
control, and that operator call reports would be made available daily:
sub-paragraphs
(a) and (b).  It further pleaded that Legion undertook to notify
Global of revenue due to be payable by a monthly statement, and
that payment
would be made within 30 days after the month end in which calls were generated,
subject to receipt of an invoice by
Legion from Global for the revenue due:
sub-paragraph (c); and that Legion agreed to direct all 190 psychic and
psychic-related call
processing requests through Global's Psychic Call Centre,
with the exception only of the then current one-off Athena Starwoman -
Woman's
Day Star Cards Promotion: sub-paragraph (d).  It continued that Global agreed
to work for Legion on an exclusive basis on
the service in Australia, and not
to offer its Psychic Call Centre capability to any other service provider
during the term of the
agreement: sub-paragraph (e).
<P>

5   	Sub-paragraph (f) alleged:-
<P>

<b>"Legion agreed to pay Global a share of all the revenue calculated by Legion
as being due from Telecom Australia using the call logging
equipment for each
number allocated to the service for the period, on the following basis:</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	calls were charged to callers at $3 per minute, of which Legion received
$2.45 per minute from which amount of $2.45 the share
of revenue between Legion
and Global was to be calculated but that the rate to callers was subject to
change and in the event of
such change the amount retained by Legion would also
change and Global would receive a proportionate share of any increase in that
amount.</b>
<P>

<b>				<u>Particulars</u></b>
<P>

<b>	The term is partly express and partly implied.  In so far as it is express
it is contained in paragraph 4(a) of the agreement.  In
so far as it is implied
it arises from the express term in order to give business efficacy to the
express term.</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	where Legion pursued independent promotional opportunities using
Global solely as call centre then, in respect of calls charged
to callers at $3
per minute, as follows:-"</b>
<P>

There was set out a formula for payment, and the paragraph concluded:-
<P>

<b>"with Legion to be responsible for payment of the uncollectible (sic) debt
levy (20%) charged by Telecom and to receive the residual
moneys retained after
the period of 7 months retention by Telecom .."</b>
<P>

6   	Sub-paragraph (3) pleaded that:-
<P>

<b>"where Global pursued independent promotional opportunities using Legion
solely as service bureau then, in respect of calls charged
to callers at $3 per
minute:"</b>
<P>

Another formula was set out, and the sub-paragraph concluded:-
<P>

<b>"with Global to be responsible for payment of the uncollectible (sic) debt
levy charged by Telecom and to receive the residual moneys
retained after the
period of 7 months retention by Telecom."</b>
<P>

7   	The pleading continued that pursuant to the Agreement
Legion provided Global with access to 5 designated telephone lines on
which
Global provided Psychic Live services exclusively to Legion, and to 19
designated telephone lines on which Global provided
Psychic Express services
exclusively to Legion.  Legion admitted that pursuant to the Agreement it
provided Global with access to
those lines, but made no other admissions.
<P>

8   	Legion also admitted paragraph 3, which alleged that
pursuant to the Agreement Legion marketed the Psychic Live service using
Global
solely as call centre, and Global marketed the Psychic Express service using
Legion solely as service bureau.
<P>

9   	Global pleaded and Legion admitted the following
allegations in paragraphs 3A and 4A:-
<P>

<b>"3A.	From 30 November 1994, Legion received psychic and psychic-related call
processing requests on:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the 190 Listed Lines; and</b>
<P>

<b> 	(b)	other 190 telephone lines (the 190 Other Lines).</b>
<P>

<b><u>PARTICULARS</u></b>
<P>

<b>The other 190 psychic and psychic-related telephone lines on which Legion
received calls can be supplied after discovery but include
at least 190 226
4064 and 190 224 3622.</b>
<P>

<b>....</b>
<P>

<b>4A.	Some of the calls received by Legion on 190 Other Lines were charged to
callers at $5 per minute, of which Legion received $4.24
per minute."</b>
<P>

10   	Global denied the breaches of the Agreement pleaded in
paragraphs 4 and 4B, and the consequences allegedly flowing therefrom
pleaded
in paragraph 5.  The breach of paragraph 3A pleaded was that in breach of the
term pleaded in sub-paragraph 1(d) Legion failed
to direct <u>all</u> psychic
and psychic-related call processing requests received by it on the 190 Other
Lines, save for the one exception, through Global's
psychic call centre.  The
breach of paragraph 4A pleaded was that pursuant to the term alleged in
sub-paragraph 1(f)(1) Global was
entitled to a proportionate share of $4.24,
"on the footing of Legion pursuing independent promotional opportunities using
Global
solely as call centre".  The alleged proportionate share was stated.
Legion also denied the breach alleged in paragraph 6 and the
consequences
allegedly flowing therefrom.
<P>

11   	The consequences of the breaches pleaded were alleged to
be that Global suffered loss, in that it lost the share of revenue
to which it
would otherwise have been entitled and, after providing particulars of damage,
it claimed $755,143.45 on the assumption
that all calls were $3 calls, and
$1,480,561.20 on the assumption that all calls were $5 calls.
<P>

12   	The pleading continued that from about December 1995,
Legion, in breach of the term pleaded in paragraph 1(d) redirected calls
on the
Psychic Express service to its Mystic Meg 190 service, whereby Global suffered
loss: paragraphs 6 and 7, which Legion denied;
and that as at 31 May 1996 there
was due and payable to Legion from Telecom residual  moneys, from the bad debt
retention levy in
respect of services provided by Global pursuing promotional
opportunities using Legion solely as service provider, in the sum of
$10,868.53, which Legion admitted.  Legion denied that pursuant to the term
pleaded in paragraph 1(f)(3) Global was entitled to receive
that sum.
<P>

13   	Legion raised certain "positive" defences.  In paragraph 8
it denied the matters alleged in paragraph 1(d) of the Amended
Summons and
asserted that, on a proper construction of the Agreement, it was only obliged
to direct to Global calls made on the 190
Listed Lines.  In the alternative
Legion asserted, in answer to the whole of the Amended Summons, that it and
Global agreed on or
about 31 March 1995 that:-
<P>

(a)	clause 4(a) and Schedule 1 of the Agreement would be varied so that the
allocation of revenue between the parties, for the period
commencing 1 April
1995, would be as set out in Legion's letter to Global of 16 March 1995 and not
as set out in Schedule 1; and
<P>

(b)	any obligation of exclusivity in clauses 1(k) and 2(c) of the Agreement
would be no longer binding on the parties.
<P>

The variation agreement was particularised as partly express and partly
implied, the express terms being in letters passing between
the parties dated
16 March 1995, 29 March 1995 and 31 March 1995.  The implication was said to
arise from the absence of a response
to the letter of 31 March 1995; the
distribution of revenue after 1 April 1995 as set forth in Legion's letter of
16 March 1995;
and the fact that Global "wound down" the advertising of Global
through Legion and promoted its psychic services through other service
bureaus.
<P>

14   	On 17 February 1999 Legion further amended to plead that
in so far as clause 1(k) imposed an obligation of exclusivity on
it in respect
of incoming calls, other than those referred to in paragraph 2 of the Amended
Summons, Global waived its right to rely
on and hold Legion to that
obligation.
<P>

15   	In paragraph 10 Legion pleaded in answer to paragraphs
1(f) and 4B that if there was an agreement between them as to the way
in which
revenue would be distributed if the call charge to callers was increased from
$3 per minute, the agreement was that such
revenue would be shared in the same
proportion as if the Charge Rate had not increased.  That term was said to be
partly express
and partly implied, the express portion arising from clause 4A
of the Agreement, and the implication arising from the necessity to
give
business efficacy to that express term.
<P>

16   	Paragraphs 11 and 12 alleged that from September to
December 1995 Global, by its conduct, evinced an intention not to be bound
by
the Agreement, which conduct Legion accepted on or about 15 December 1995 as a
repudiation in a telephone conversation between
Mr Burden of Legion and Mr
Turnbull of Global on or about that date.
<P>

17   	Legion asserted a number of other matters, which allegedly
entitled it to bring the Agreement to an end or meant that no damage
was
suffered, viz:-
<P>

(i)	that it was a term that if the number of call minutes on the 190 Listed
Lines fell below 2000 per month the Agreement would
come to an end; that that
happened in October 1995; and that the Agreement either came to or was brought
to an end.  This allegation
was not pressed;
<P>

(ii)	that the parties had, by 15 December 1995, agreed to abandon their
respective rights and obligations under the Agreement;
<P>

(iii)	that it was a term of the Agreement, it being alleged that the term was
implied to give it business efficacy, that either
party could terminate it on
giving reasonable notice, which Legion did by giving 7 days' notice; and
<P>

(iv)	that Global suffered no loss if Legion was in breach because it could not
provide the necessary service.
<P>

18   	Finally, Legion relied on a set-off by virtue of an
entitlement to damages for breach of the Agreement by Global, which was
more
fully set out in the Cross-Claim.
<P>

<b>The Amended Cross-Claim</b>
<P>

19   	On 15 February 1999 Legion filed an Amended Cross-Claim
asserting the Agreement of 30 November 1994 and alleging three breaches
by
Global, viz the failure to maintain service opening hours; the failure to
ensure there were sufficient operators available to
cover the service at all
times; and the failure to adhere to an agreement to work for Legion on an
exclusive basis on the Psychic
Hot Line service detailed in Schedule 1 in
Australia and offer Legion first option for other related services not detailed
in that
Schedule.  The last mentioned breach was the subject of the amendment,
it being asserted in paragraph 4A that by reason thereof Legion
was not able to
take up the option from which it would have derived income, which was earned by
another service provider.
<P>

20   	In its Defence to the Amended Cross-Claim, which was also
filed in Court on 15 February 1999, Global admitted the terms of
the Agreement
and asserted that Legion was bound to provide it with call figures on a monthly
basis, which it failed to do after
June 1995 with the consequence that Global
was deprived of the ability to determine roster schedules and the numbers of
operators,
who should be rostered on at any time.  It was pleaded, in these
circumstances, that insofar as Global failed to maintain service
opening hours
or to ensure that there were sufficient operators available to cover the
service at all times, any such failure was
caused by Legion's own breach of its
obligations.
<P>

21   	In relation to the allegation concerning Psychic Hotline
Pty Limited Global denied it was its partner and the alleged breach
of the
agreement.
<P>

<b>Matters Not In Dispute</b>
<P>

22   	It is convenient to note a number of matters, which the
parties expressly agreed were not in dispute, viz:-
<P>

(a)	That all the calls on the 190 lines specified in paragraph 2 of the Summary
of Contentions as "Psychic Live" and "Psychic Express"
were directed to Global
until about 15 December 1995;
<P>

(b)	That thereafter calls on those lines were not directed to Global;
<P>

(c)	That Legion received calls on other 190 lines as alleged in paragraph 3A(b)
and that it did not direct those calls to Global
but directed them to other
information providers; and
<P>

(d)	That 1,145,071 minutes of psychic and psychic-related calls were received
by Legion during the period from the commencement
of the Agreement until 31
March 1996 and not directed to Global, they being the ones which came on "the
190 Other Lines" referred
to in paragraph 3A(b).
<P>

23   	A further matter which was not in issue was that once
lines had been dedicated to Global by the setting up of the necessary
computer
equipment so that when the telephone numbers were dialled the computer
automatically directed the call to the number so
dialled, there could be no ad
hoc interference with that call being received at that number.  It was also
agreed that the consequence
of that was that the telephone would either be
answered by an operative of Global or, if there was no operative available, an
engaged
signal would be given.
<P>

24   	When these matters are understood it becomes clear that
the real issue, so far as the redirecting or diverting of calls, revolved
around Legion's not acting exclusively, in this field, as a provider of
services to Global, but also providing the same service to
other persons
providing psychic reading services to members of the public, who telephoned on
"the 190 Other Lines".
<P>

<b>The Agreement</b>
<P>

25   	The Agreement, which is headed "Agreement for 190 InfoCall
Services", was prepared by the parties without the assistance of
lawyers.
After specifying the date it was "drawn up", which was stated as 30 November
1994 and which was accepted as the date it
was entered into, and the parties,
it stated:-
<P>

<b>"For the provision of a live Psychic reading premium rate service on the 190
InfoCall network."</b>
<P>

That sentence is followed by the word "WHEREAS" and the next line stated:-
<P>

<b>"1.	Legion undertakes to:".</b>
<P>

26   	Thereafter there are a number of sub-paragraphs, some of
which follow from the words "Legion undertakes to" and some of which
are
introduced by the words "agree" and "agrees".  I shall refer to Legion's
undertaking to do various matters as its being "obliged
to" or "obliged".  The
parties acknowledged that the sub-paragraphs in paragraph 1 introduced by the
words "agree" and "agrees" should
not be read as meaning that Legion undertook
to agree or to "agrees", but rather that the words "agree" and "agrees"
constituted
an agreement between the parties.
<P>

27   	The opening words, which I have quoted, indicate that the
Agreement was for the provision of the stated service on the particular
network, and this is supported by clause 1(a) whereby Legion undertook to
provide access to telephone lines to handle premium rate
audiotex services as
detailed in Schedule 1.  In Schedule 1, beside the word "Service",
appeared:-
<P>

<b>"Psychic Hotline.  This service is operated by live operators, with Legion
outswitching call traffic to the operator bureau."</b>
<P>

28   	Immediately thereafter, Schedule 1 provided:-
<P>

<b>"BRANDING.	The Service name may, from time to time, change as both parties
see fit.  Legion and Global to keep each other notified
of any change of name
of the Service.</b>
<P>

<b>  ON-LINE DATES.	As mutually agreed.</b>
<P>

<b>  OFF LINE DATES. Off-line date is that date which is mutually agreed by
both Legion, Global or in the event that the call traffic
falls below 2000 call
minutes per month."</b>
<P>

29   	Clause 1(b) obliged Legion to use its best endeavours to
ensure the "Service(s)" were set up and fully operational on the
telephone
numbers, and clause 1(c) obliged it to supply Global with call figures and
operator call reports relating to the "Service(s)"
monthly or at such longer
period as may be necessary due to circumstances beyond Legion's control.  It
provided that "Operator Call
Reports" would be made available daily.
<P>

30   	Clause 1(d) required Legion to ensure that the content of
all services complied with a specified code and any other regulations,
including Telstra's functional specifications for 190 Infocall services.
<P>

31   	Clause 1(f) obliged Legion to explore promotional
opportunities independently or jointly with Global in mediums other than
defined in Schedule 1.  Schedule 1, beside the heading "Promotion of Services",
stated:-
<P>

<b>"Promotion of the service to be pursued independently by Global and Legion
under the following exclusions and other means as referred
to in 1(f) and
1(k).</b>
<P>

<b>Legion: media identified as exclusive to them</b>
<P>

<b>ACP Publishing, Murdoch Magazines, Pacific Print Advertising, Seven Network
nationally and Austext.</b>
<P>

<b>Global: media identified as exclusive to them</b>
<P>

<b>Ten Network, SBS, Ratio and Television Informercials (other than the Seven
Network and Austext) and Shop a Dockets."</b>
<P>

32   	Clause 1(g) obliged Legion to supply Global with a
schedule, on a monthly basis, of planned media campaigns for the services
outlined in Schedule 1, and clause 1(h) obliged it to ensure that every time
the number was promoted the relevant cost message was
always included as set
out in the regulations and Code of Practice from TISCC and Telecom Australia or
other Network Provider respectively.
<P>

33   	Clause 1(i) obliged Legion to notify Global of revenue due
to be payable by the provision of a monthly statement, and provided
that
payment would be made within 30 days after the month end in which calls were
generated, subject to the receipt of an invoice
by Legion from Global for the
revenue due.  Clause 1(j) noted the agreement of Legion to conduct a Management
Meeting with Global
on a regular basis not less than once every calendar
month.
<P>

34   	Clause 1(k), which is of fundamental importance,
stated:-
<P>

<b>"Agrees to direct all 190 Psychic and Psychic-related call processing
requests through Global's Psychic Call Centre, with the exception
of the
current one-off Athena Starwoman - Woman's Day Star Cards promotion."</b>
<P>

35   	Global has submitted that this provision amounted to an
agreement by Legion that all psychic and psychic-related call processing
requests on 190 numbers, save for the exception, but irrespective of whether
the 190 numbers were those dedicated to Psychic Live
and Psychic Express or
were "190 Other Lines", were to be directed to Global's Psychic Call Centre,
and that this constituted an
agreement for exclusivity in the sense that Legion
would not accept business from others engaged in psychic and psychic-related
call
processing requests on 190 numbers or, if it did, it would do so on the
basis that they were directed to Global's Call Centre.
<P>

36   	The submission continued that  because Legion had no power
to divert, at least on an ad hoc basis, calls made to the listed
lines, and
because it had no power if it was providing a similar service to other psychic
and psychic-related activities to direct
calls away from them to the listed
lines dedicated to Global, the provision for exclusivity could only mean that
it would not enter
into any arrangements with other persons engaged in that
type of business.  It was submitted by Mr Brereton that the exception in
the
sub-clause made this clear.
<P>

37   	By clause 1(l) Legion agreed to keep the agreement it had
with Telecom in connection with the InfoCall 190 service in force,
and that any
breach of that constituted a breach of the Agreement by Legion entitling Global
to damages.
<P>

38   	Clause 2 is headed:-
<P>

<b>"Global &amp; it's (sic) partners or assignees undertake to".</b>
<P>

Sub-clause (c) is in the following terms:-
<P>

<b>"Agree to work for Legion on an exclusive basis on the services detailed in
Schedule 1 in Australia (the Territory), and offer legion
(sic) first option
for other related services not detailed in Schedule 1.  This clause will be
subject to review at the end of each
three month period or in the event of a
sale to a third party.  Further it is understood that Global will not offer
it's (sic) Psychic
Call Centre capability to any other Service Provider during
the term of this agreement."</b>
<P>

39   	To some extent this may be seen as the mirror image of
clause 1(k), although the word "all" in clause 1(k) is more all embracing
than
the words in clause 2(c), particularly in so far as there are the option
provisions, which provide, at least to Legion, an element
of choice.  It may be
thought strange if one party was offering exclusivity, but the other was not.

<P>

40   	Subsequent clauses imposed obligations on Global as to the
way in which it would conduct itself in essence to ensure that
Legion had the
benefit of the Agreement.
<P>

41   	Clauses 2(l) and (m) provided that Global confirmed that
it would maintain service opening hours and would notify Legion of
any changes
relating to them, and that it would ensure that there were sufficient operators
available to cover the service at all
times based on call statistics and
operator management information supplied by Legion on a regular basis.  Thus
compliance with the
latter clause was dependent on activity on the part of
Legion.
<P>

42   	Clause 4, it being agreed that there is no clause 3,
provided that Legion agreed to pay Global a share of the revenue as set
out in
Schedule 1, revenue being defined as that calculated by Legion as being due
from Telecom for using the call logging equipment
for each number allocated to
the service(s) and for the period specified in Schedule 1. Telecom received the
amounts from the callers,
they being debited by Telecom for the calls, and
on-paid money, less its costs and the retention sum for potentially bad debts
to
Legion as, in effect, Telecom's customer.  Schedule 1 provided two bases for
the division of revenue, viz:-
<P>

<b>"On the basis of Legion pursuing independent promotional opportunities using
Global solely as Call Centre ...."; and</b>
<P>

<b>"On the basis of Global pursuing independent promotional opportunities using
Legion solely as Service Bureau ....".</b>
<P>

In the first instance, save for the first bracket of minutes per month, Legion
received more.  In the second, subject to the same
proviso, Global received
more.  These figures seem to have been worked on a Telecom charge of $3 per
minute.  The first basis concluded:-
<P>

<b>"Legion to be responsible for payment of the uncollectable debt levy (20%)
charged by Telecom and will receive the residual monies
retained after the
period of seven months retention by Telecom.  This levy may be subject to
change from Telecom from time to time."</b>
<P>

The second basis concluded in substantially the same terms, but specifying
Global in lieu of Legion.
<P>

The concluding sentence of clause 4(a) stated:-
<P>

<b>"However, the call charges are subject to change and hence the amount
retained by Legion and subsequently Global will be subject to
this
change."</b>
<P>

43   	Clauses 4(b) and (c) provided for the consequences of
material changes to the service and the resolution of disputes over
revenue
share.
<P>

44   	Clause 4(d) provided:-
<P>

<b>"Structure of payment of all charges relating to the number allocation,
rental, connection and switching of the services are outlined
in Schedule 2 of
this Agreement."</b>
<P>

45   	Clause 5 dealt with the duration of the Agreement
providing that either or both of the parties, either may, or more probably,
shall "review the situation at regular three monthly intervals", and that if
any party failed to comply with its terms the other
may give notice to the
party in default to rectify such non-compliance within thirty days and, if
after that period the non-compliance
was not rectified, the complaining party
may terminate the Agreement forthwith by giving written notice.
<P>

46   	Clause 8, where first appearing, is headed "Number
Portability" and provided:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	If Legion fails to comply with the terms of this agreement, or Global's
Psychic interests are sold to another party, subject
to clause 6(b), then
Legion agrees that they will release the numbers assigned under Revenue Deal 2
in Schedule 1 of this agreement
to the Service Provider of Global's or
subsequent owners choice."</b>
<P>

There is no clause 6(b) and it is not clear to me that there are any numbers
assigned under Revenue Deal 2 in Schedule 1.
<P>

47   	The provisions for the distribution of revenue in Schedule
1 are, in my opinion, helpful in seeking to determine the issue
of exclusivity.
The entitlement of Legion to be paid the rate set forth in Revenue Deal 1
depended on its pursuing independent promotional
opportunities using Global
"solely" as the call centre. This raises the question as to how "solely" is to
be interpreted.  On the
other hand the lesser rate payable to Legion applies
where Global pursues independent promotional opportunities using Legion
"solely"
as the service bureau.  Once again the proper interpretation of
"solely" is raised, although it could hardly be suggested that it
had different
meanings wherever used in the same provision.  A potential difficulty, which
may rise, is what is to happen if either
Legion or Global does not use the
other "solely" in the role specified.  In such circumstances no method for
distribution of revenue
is provided.  Further, the income split provided for a
lesser amount than $2.45.
<P>

48   	Schedule 2 was headed "190 Number Allocation", and was
concerned, firstly, with the charge made by Telecom for each number
issued and
the monthly rental charge for that number, which was to be allocated as between
Legion and Global under paragraphs 1 and
2 in Schedule 1.  The remaining costs,
which are for Centel line connections, were to be shared equally between Global
and Legion
and to be deducted monthly from net revenue.  This may tend to
indicate that the only matters causing concern were the actual lines
dedicated
to Global.
<P>

<b>A Refinement Of The Issues</b>
<P>

49   	Global's case was based upon the breach pleaded in
paragraph 4, viz a failure to direct all 190 psychic and psychic-related
call
processing requests received by Legion on the 190 Other Lines through Global's
psychic call centre.  At Tpp.28-29, the following
transpired:-
<P>

<b>"HIS HONOUR: There is something I want to ask someone and that is whether
the people in the position of ITM or Legion are able to
divert calls themselves
or whether it comes through automatically once a person is logged on.  I don't
know whether Mr Lovell's expertise
goes to that.</b>
<P>

<b>STEVENSON: Q. I think it is an automatic process.  The number dialled is
determinative of where the call will go and then you look
to see if the
operator is logged on to see the next available operator who is logged on and
not on the phone.</b>
<P>

<b>BRERETON: I agree with that.  As I understand the position what happens is
if someone calls, for example, Psychic Live and there are
three operators
logged on and one or more of those operators is not currently taking another
call, then the computer will select,
will identify one or two of those
operators are free and direct the call to that operator.  If they are all busy
their calls do play
the engaged signal and if no one is logged on it plays the
engaged signal as well, but there is no capacity in the service bureau
or
provider selecting which operator it goes to.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Or to divert from your client, relevantly, to Mystic Meg or
whatever her name is.</b>
<P>

<b>BRERETON: There was ultimately a capacity to do so but as I understand it it
cannot be done on an ad hoc call by call basis.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Provided somebody rings up your client's number as advertised
they will either get one of your client's operatives or
the engaged
signal?</b>
<P>

<b>BRERETON: Yes."</b>
<P>

50   	Against this background it is convenient to return to the
pleadings.  Paragraph 3A of the Amended Summons, the facts pleaded
in which
were admitted, identified the 190 Listed Lines and the 190 Other Lines.  The
breach alleged in paragraph 4 is that in breach
of the pleaded requirement of
clause 1(k), (sub-paragraph 1(d)), Legion agreed to direct all 190 psychic and
psychic-related call
processing requests through Global's Psychic Call Centre,
with the exception only of the current one-off Athena Starwoman - Woman's
Day
Star Cards Promotion, and "Legion failed to direct all 190 psychic and
psychic-related call process requests received by it on
the 190 Other Lines",
save for the exception, through Global's Psychic Call Centre.  Therefore, the
issue is whether the Agreement,
on its proper construction, imposed this
obligation on Legion.
<P>

<b>Legion's Defence of Variation</b>
<P>

51   	In paragraph 9 of its Defence to the Amended Summons
Legion pleaded the variation to the Agreement said to have been effected
on or
about 31 March 1995 to which I have referred.  None of the facts furnished in
the particulars, as facts, were in issue. 
<P>

52   	In paragraph 3A of its Amended Cross-Claim Legion pleaded
that in breach of clause 2(c) Global "and/or its partner Psychic
Hot Line Pty
Limited (`Psychic Hot Line') promoted services to those detailed in Schedule 1
through service bureaus other than Legion
without offering Legion first option
for those services".  In the particulars the services were said to have been
promoted through
Information Dialling Services Pty Limited, ("IDS"), and
Interactive Tele-Media Pty Limited, ("ITM").  It was pleaded in paragraph
4A
that as a result of the breach Legion suffered loss because had it been offered
first option it would have agreed to process calls
to such services and would
have been entitled to the revenue earned by ITM from 30 November 1994 "until
the date on which the agreement
between Legion and Global was varied as alleged
at paragraph 9 of the Amended Defence, alternatively until 31 December 1995".
It
was also pleaded that particulars in relation to losses occasioned through
IDS would be provided in due course.
<P>

53   	In answer to paragraphs 3A and 4A Global denied that
Psychic Hot Line Pty Limited was its partner; that it breached the agreement;
and otherwise did not admit the allegations.
<P>

54   	The facsimile transmission of 16 March 1995 was sent by Mr
David Burden to Mr Nigel Anthony Lovell, the principal director
of and a fifty
per cent shareholder in Global.  It complained about certain matters, including
low margins because of the alleged
poor performance of Global, and proposed an
amendment to the revenue "deal" by amending paragraph 1 relating to Revenue
Distribution
in the Schedule in the manner set forth.  It stated that that
would allow Legion to re-commence its advertising programme and asked
for Mr
Lovell's comments.
<P>

55   	Mr Lovell responded on 29 March 1995 accepting the revised
schedule on a three months' trial basis beginning on 1 April 1995
with a review
of the position thereafter.  The facsimile transmission continued:-
<P>

<b>"In agreeing to the revised schedule we would seek to amend our existing
agreement to allow for the following change: </b>
<P>

<b>* Non-exclusivity as a call processing centre.  The reasons for this are as
follows;</b>
<P>

<b>1).	The original agreement clearly stated that Global Network Services would
be the exclusive call processing centre for all of Legion's
psychic activity
apart from the one-off Woman's Day Athena Starwoman promo.  This has never been
the case.  Legion have continued
to establish their own processing centre in
direct competition to Global.  Please see the attached agreement and the
sections marked.</b>
<P>

<b>2).	It has been clearly established that providing an exclusive call
processing centre for Legion activity is not viable.  To push
the business into
the realm of reasonable profit margins we must process volume calls on a
consistent basis.  The lumpy unpredictable
nature of call activity so far has
required a high degree of commitment by us and the unending patience of our
readers to try to
come to grips with chasing our tail 14 hours a day, 7 days a
week."</b>
<P>

This communication made clear that Mr Lovell was contending for an exclusive
arrangement of the type alleged.
<P>

56   	The facsimile transmission went on to elaborate, at some
length, the benefits of this proposal, and concluded by suggesting
a meeting to
discuss the issues in more detail.
<P>

57   	On 31 March 1995 Mr Burden responded.  At p.2, in dealing
with certain argumentative matters, he wrote:-
<P>

<b>"Another bone of contention you hold is in regard to the Athena service.
Both yourself and Simon claim that Adam stated that this
service would be a
one-off promotion.  Neither Adam, nor Glenda can remember such a statement
being made.  I have always maintained
that this service was running for the
duration, this is ratified in the agreement between us, which lists the Athena
service as an
exception to the exclusivity agreement."</b>
<P>

58   	Subsequently on the same page he wrote:-
<P>

<b>"Your organisation has graciously allowed a modification to the Legion
Telecall advertised service deal.  However in the same breath
you have asked
for the exclusivity to be removed.  I naturally assume that this applies to
both parties."</b>
<P>

59   	He continued:-
<P>

<b>"We understand your desire to work with other Service Provider's to build
volume.  This will keep your operators content.  However
we are very concerned
that this move will reduce your levels of service, and increase the number of
failed calls.  This claim is
naturally refuted by yourselves, but realistically
I can see no other option for the short term.  I do agree that once volume
builds,
the operators confidence is restored, and more than likely you will be
in a position to handle the calls.  The question mark remains
over the level of
service while this transformation takes place.</b>
<P>

<b>With your business spread across a number of bureaus, I can not see how you
can facilitate the same operators providing services for
all."</b>
<P>

60   	The penultimate paragraph of the letter stated:-
<P>

<b>"We would have to very carefully consider your suggested approach to
supporting a number of Service Provider's.  This would require
you to fully
explain the bureau operation and to guarantee a level of service to Legion
Telecall.  In your response please also consider
the financial support and
advertising you would give to your own services facilitated by each Service
Provider, given your stated
financial position."</b>
<P>

This letter not only seemed to accept that there was an arrangement for
exclusivity, but that it was in Legion's interests to maintain
it.
<P>

61   	The correspondence proceeded, however, on the basis that
Legion sought a reduction in Global's share of revenue to which Global
said it
would agree on a trial basis provided the exclusivity provisions were removed.
The facsimile transmission of 31 March 1995
does not accept, in terms, this
suggestion, and Mr Stevenson accepted that the correspondence was inconclusive
as to whether there
was an agreement.  But, from 1 April 1995 the parties
conducted their affairs on the basis of the changed revenue allocation and,
so
far as Global was concerned, on the basis that it was no longer bound by the
exclusivity provisions.  Mr Stevenson submitted that
this constituted an
acceptance of Legion's requirement for a reduction in Global's share of revenue
in return for Global's not being
required to act as the exclusive Call
Centre.
<P>

62   	In his witness statement, Exhibit A, of 4 June 1998 Mr
Lovell annexed the various facsimile transmissions and, in paragraph
47,
referred to a meeting on 7 April 1995 between himself, Mr Turnbull, Ms Ramzan
and Mr Burden.  Ms Taylor was not at the meeting,
but she was in the same room
and heard what was said.  Mr Lovell asserted that he raised with Mr Burden a
prime concern that Legion
had not kept its agreement that Global would be the
exclusive call processing centre for all of Legion's psychic activities.  He
then referred Mr Burden to the Agreement and, in particular, to clause 1(k).
He said that that clause had not been complied with
and that after Mr Burden
read it "there was a long silence and he shook his head" and said:-
<P>

<b>"I have to agree with you, I'll have to take the matter up with Adam and get
back to you."</b>
<P>

63   	There was some further conversation and, in paragraph 48,
Mr Lovell said that he did not hear back from Mr Burden about the
Agreement and
he then "wound down the advertising of Global through Legion".  It was not in
issue that Mr Burden did not respond.
<P>

64   	At Tp.30 Mr Lovell was shown a letter of 1 March 1995,
which he wrote to IDS, which he agreed was sent with a view to entering
into
some business relationship with IDS and to persuade it that Global's readers
were properly qualified and provided a worthwhile
service, which it would be in
the interests of IDS to process.  He was then taken to the facsimile
transmission of 16 March 1995.
<P>

65   	Mr Lovell was referred to his facsimile transmission of 29
March 1995 and he agreed that as from 1 April 1995 revenue was
allocated in
accordance with Mr Burden's formula set out on 16 March 1995 to which Mr Lovell
made no protest.  He further agreed,
Tp.34, that from that time he took the
decision to wind down the advertising of Global through Legion, and shortly
thereafter an
arrangement was entered into between Global and IDS.  At Tp.35
his evidence continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And I suggest the reason you were able to do this was that you felt that
Global had shed itself of such obligations of exclusivity
as it might otherwise
have had to Legion after 30 November?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I don't believe so.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Do you say that you were of the state of mind that you were not acting in
breach of the obligations of exclusivity?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. The position is that by July 1995 and I suggest in April 1995 your state
of mind was that such obligation of exclusivity as Global
might have had by the
agreement, had been discharged?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No, it was not in April.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Certainly July?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

66   	Mr Lovell was referred to further communications between
Global and IDS and, in particular, to a facsimile transmission of
November 1995
in paragraph 2 of which he referred to a psychic live service with an
advertising campaign to commence on 4 December
1995.  He agreed he knew that
service was one Legion was promoting pursuant to the Agreement of 30 November
1994, which he sought
to explain by saying that activity in Psychic Live was
very low and, at Tp.37, he gave the following evidence:-
<P>

<b>"Q. I want to suggest to you that the only way to characterise your conduct
in writing this letter was that either you regarded the
agreement as being at
an end or you were behaving in a commercially immoral and cavalier
fashion?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Do you agree with that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Q. Which of those two?</b>
<P>

<b>A. We were acting or I acted against the agreement, the existing agreement
with Legion."</b>
<P>

67   	He denied that in his mind he regarded Global as having
abandoned the contract.
<P>

68   	In re-examination, Tp.38, he was asked about his agreement
to the proposition that the obligation of exclusivity of Global
to Legion had
been discharged in July 1995.  He was asked what caused him to form that view
and he said:-
<P>

<b>"Well so many services had been established by Legion such as Mystic Meg,
Susanna Miles and so I felt that Legion were not honouring
their side of the
agreement."</b>
<P>

69   	There was no evidence of any complaint to this effect
after the meeting of 7 April 1995 to which I have referred.
<P>

70   	Mr Lovell agreed, Tp.38, that the business relationship
with IDS was consummated in July 1995.
<P>

71   	In paragraph 25 of her witness statement of 4 June 1998 Ms
Taylor gave evidence of the meeting of 7 April 1995.  She recalled
hearing Mr
Lovell say:-
<P>

<b>"We have a very clear agreement that we are the exclusive call processing
centre.  Have you seen the signed agreement?"</b>
<P>

She heard some rustling of papers and Mr Lovell say:-
<P>

<b>"Just here it says we are responsible for processing all your psychic calls
with the exception of the current one of Athena star cards
promotion.  This has
not happened."</b>
<P>

72   	She said there was a period of silence of about five
seconds and that Mr Burden said:-
<P>

<b>"I haven't seen this before.  I have to agree with you.  I'll have to talk
to Adam and get back to you on this."</b>
<P>

Ms Taylor was not cross-examined about this conversation.
<P>

73   	In paragraph 17 of his witness statement of 4 June 1998,
Exhibit C, Mr Turnbull gave evidence about the conversation on 7
April 1995.
He said that Mr Burden said that if Global gave Legion exclusivity, Legion
would give Global "Mystic Meg to process exclusively".
 He said that he replied
that the existing agreement was to process Legion's psychic calls exclusively,
which had not happened. 
Thereafter the Agreement was produced and Mr Turnbull
heard Mr Lovell say:
<P>

<b>"It clearly states that we are responsible for processing all Legion's
psychic calls with the exception of the then current one of
Athena Starwoman
Woman's Day star cards promotion.  This has not been happening."</b>
<P>

74   	Mr Turnbull said, without objection, that Mr Burden
appeared to read that section of the Agreement and looked shocked, and
said
that he would have to speak to Adam "and get back to you".  Mr Turnbull was not
cross-examined about that conversation.
<P>

75   	Ms Ramzan, in paragraph 29 of her witness statement of 3
September 1998, Exhibit E, said that she attended the meeting on
7 April 1995,
although she makes no reference to any discussion about exclusivity.  She was
not cross-examined about the conversation.
<P>

76   	In his witness statement of 10 August 1998, Exhibit 1, Mr
Burden referred to the meeting of 7 April 1995 and he agreed that
Mr Turnbull
and Ms Ramzan were present and that Mr Lovell said:-
<P>

<b>"We believe we have an exclusive arrangement with you for the Athena
Starwoman business and that simply hasn't been happening."</b>
<P>

He said he replied that that was not his understanding of the contract "at
all", and he said that he complained to Mr Lovell that
Global was not
processing the calls through one call centre as was originally agreed.  He also
complained that the business with
ITM had not been brought to Legion. 
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Submissions On Construction</b>
<P>

77   	Global submitted that the Agreement was for the provision
of a live psychic reading premium rate service on the 190 InfoCall
network and
that, relevantly, it provided that Legion would provide access "to telephone
lines to handle premium rate audiotex live
psychic reading services.  That,
according to clause 1(a), was to be done "as detailed in Schedule 1", namely
the provision of a
Psychic Hotline to be operated by live operators "with
Legion outswitching call traffic to the operator bureau".  The submissions
set
forth a number of the terms of clause 1, with particular reference to clause
1(k), and then various provisions of clause 2, with
particular reference to
clauses 2(c), (l) and (m).
<P>

78   	The submissions turned to a consideration of the
"Financial Terms" in clause 4(a) and Schedule 1 and, in relation to the word
"solely" in the Schedule, submitted that it governed "the function - service
bureau or call centre - and not the entity, Legion or
Global".  In his oral
submissions, Mr Brereton contended that the word "solely" meant "merely".  This
submission was made to meet
Mr Stevenson's submission that "solely" meant that
when Global was being used "solely as Call centre" or Legion was being used
"solely
as Service Bureau", it meant that parties other than Global and Legion
respectively could be used by the other for that purpose.
 In each event it was
necessary for Legion, as the service provider, to have an entity in the nature
of Global providing the call
centre facility, i.e. the persons who would
receive and answer the calls.  Similarly, so far as Global was concerned, it
was necessary
for it to have a service provider, such as Legion, to ensure that
telephone calls were directed to Global's operatives; that the
necessary
financial records of those calls were maintained; and that, accordingly, there
was provision for the division of finances.
 Thus, if Legion pursued
independent promotional opportunities it derived a larger percentage of
revenue, save for the first bracket
of time, and if Global pursued those
opportunities, it derived a larger percentage of revenue, save for the first
bracket of time,
no doubt the larger percentage reflecting the cost of
independent promotion in advertising, inter alia, in the media outlets
identified
beside "Promotion of Services" in Schedule 1.
<P>

79   	Mr Brereton submitted that the word "solely" in both
Revenue Deal clauses meant, in clause 1, "with Global performing the
role of
Call Centre only and not any promotional role", so that all the word "solely"
does is describe that for the purposes of that
paragraph Global is only a Call
Centre.  So far as clause 2 is concerned, he submitted that Legion undertook no
additional role but
remained "solely" the Service Bureau, and Global assumed
the additional role of independent promoter.
<P>

80   	Mr Brereton submitted that in circumstances in which, i.e.
on the basis of Legion's pursuing promotional opportunities independently
of
Global, such that Global's sole or only role in relation to the production of
revenue was as Call Centre the "Revenue Deal" was
as stated in paragraph 1;
whereas in circumstances in which Global pursued  promotional opportunities
independently of Legion, such
that Legion's sole or only role in relation to
the production of revenue was as a Service Bureau, the "Revenue Deal" was as
stated
in paragraph 2.  In the first instance, save in the first minutes per
month band, Legion was remunerated more highly than Global
for the pursuit of
independent promotional opportunities; and, in the second instance, save in the
first minutes per month band,
Global was remunerated more highly than Legion
for the pursuit of independent promotional opportunities.
<P>

81   	Mr Stevenson's submission, in essence, was that if Legion
used Global "solely as Call Centre" it necessarily followed that
the Agreement
contemplated that Legion would not "only" or "solely" use Global in that role
and, therefore, may use another operator
where it pursued independent
promotional opportunities.  His further submission was that if Global used
Legion "solely as Service
Bureau" it necessarily followed that the Agreement
contemplated that Global would not "only" or "solely" use Legion in that role
and, therefore, may use another service bureau where it pursued independent
promotional opportunities.
<P>

82   	The concluding words of each paragraph are, in the light
of these submissions, significant.  In the first instance, Legion,
which
received the greater share of revenue, was to be responsible for payment of the
uncollectable debt being charged by Telecom
and entitled to the residual moneys
retained after the Telecom retention period.  In the second instance, Global
had the responsibilities
and entitlements, which Legion had under the first.
<P>

83   	Clauses 1(f) and 2(j) obliged Legion and Global
respectively to explore promotional opportunities independently of or jointly
with Global and Legion respectively in mediums other than those defined in
Schedule 1.  The Agreement does not provide for the manner
of division of
revenue in the event of a joint promotional opportunity, but, in the
circumstances of this case, that does not matter,
in the sense of throwing
light on the possible construction.  Clause 4(a) makes clear that there was an
agreement by Legion to pay
Global a share of revenue as provided in Schedule 1.
There is no suggestion in clause 4(a) or Schedule 1 of a payment to any other
Call Centre or Service Bureau.
<P>

84   	The submission Global had to meet was that on Legion's
construction "solely" meant that neither Global nor Legion was bound
to pursue
independent promotional opportunities using the other for the provision of the
services to which reference was made, the
division of revenue only occurring
where that was done "solely as call centre" or "solely as service bureau".
<P>

85   	The submissions continued that pursuant to the agreement
Legion provided Global with access to five psychic live lines, which
were
identified by the number 64, and nineteen psychic express lines, which were
identified by the number 60.  These were the "190
Listed Lines" and, as I have
said, it was not in issue that Legion did not allow those lines to be used by
any entity other than
Global prior to about 15 December 1995, nor that calls
could not be diverted from them on an ad hoc basis.
<P>

86   	Global's claim, of course, is that Legion permitted calls
to be made on "the 190 Other Lines" and, from about 15 December
1995,
re-directed calls on the Psychic Live and Psychic Express services to the
Mystic Meg 190 service, the total time of the calls
to the "190 Other Lines"
and the diverted calls from about 15 December 1995 being 1,145,071 minutes,
which figure was not in issue.
<P>

87   	Global submitted that the principal issue concerned the
construction of the agreement and, in particular, clause 1(k), the
question
being whether, upon the proper construction of the agreement, Legion was bound
to direct that number of minutes to Global.
 It submitted that the context,
known to both parties, in which the agreement was made, and in particular in
which clause 1(k) came
to be included, was that Legion wanted to enter the live
psychic reading market as a service bureau; Global had experience in that
market and wanted to be the exclusive call processing centre for Legion for
psychic and psychic-related calls; in negotiating the
agreement, Legion was
prepared to consider making Global its exclusive call processing centre for
such calls save for the Athena
exception; and Global requested the addition of
clause 1(k) to which Legion agreed.
<P>

88   	Mr Burden, who was the main witness called by Legion,
agreed that during the negotiation period he said to Mr Lovell words
to the
effect that all calls would be handled by Global through its call processing
centre; that he was keen to put all calls through
Global "because Global was my
client, yes"; and, once again, that all calls "will be handled by Global
through its call processing
centre"; Tp.140.  In these circumstances Legion
agreed to insert clause 1(k).
<P>

89   	The submission continued that the plain words of clause
1(k) could lead to no other result, because the agreement was to direct
"all"
calls and, as no particular services were identified either in the Agreement or
the Schedule, save for the Athena Starwoman
exception:-
<P>

<b>"... it is impossible to say that the obligation of exclusivity was to be
restricted to the 190 Listed Lines, the number, identification,
and name of
which were not specified by the agreement, and for which the agreement provided
no means of identification."</b>
<P>

90   	It was submitted that if the agreement was construed
otherwise, the obligation of exclusivity would be illusory because it
could be
circumvented by Legion's opening an additional 190 line at any time and, in
circumstances where both parties knew that Global
was seeking an exclusive
arrangement, such a result would be totally uncommercial.  It was further
submitted that this construction
gained force from the express exception, which
assumed that such calls "would otherwise have been caught".  It was submitted
that
any other construction would render the exception "mere surplusage".
<P>

91   	The next submission drew attention to a comparison of
clauses 1(k) and 2(c), and noted that the first referred to "all" relevant
calls, and the second to "services detailed in Schedule 1".  It was
suggested:-
<P>

<b>"While Global's obligations of exclusivity were limited to the services
described in the Schedule (and related services), Legion's
were not; they
extended to all psychic and psychic-related call processing requests."</b>
<P>

Mr Brereton submitted that the first option for other related services meant
that if Global developed a "related service", not being
the service specified
in Schedule 1, i.e. being a service different from a psychic or psychic-related
service, Global was obliged
to offer that to Legion.  Mr Stevenson submitted
that a "related service" meant a psychic or psychic-related service.  In the
end
I do not think that the difference matters.  The service may be one or the
other, but whichever it be, on a proper construction of
the Agreement, I do not
think that it impinges on the exclusivity point.
<P>

92   	It was submitted that far from being uncommercial, in the
context in which clause 1(k) came to be in the Agreement, it gave
effect to
"precisely what the parties had been contemplating in their negotiations".
<P>

93   	Mr Stevenson submitted that the terms of the Agreement
made clear that the "Services" were those, and only those, promoted
by either
Legion or Global pursuant to it.  They were to be provided, he submitted, in
the context of the telephone numbers to be
allotted to the parties under the
Agreement, namely the 190 Listed Lines.  He submitted so much was made clear by
the recital, which
was to be read as:-
<P>

<b>"For the provision [by the parties] of a live Psychic reading premium
service [to be promoted by Global or Legion] on the 190 InfoCall
network."</b>
<P>

The additional words in square brackets are those it was submitted were
necessary to give sense to the recital in the context of
the Agreement.
<P>

94   	The submission continued that clause 1(a) was an
undertaking by Legion to provide access to telephone lines to handle the
services detailed in Schedule 1, so that the obligation of Legion was to
provide dedicated telephone lines for the provision of a
Psychic Hotline to be
operated by live operators for whom Global was responsible: clauses 2(a), (h),
(l), (m) and (n).  Thus, so
the submission ran, Legion was obliged to provide
access to telephone numbers; to use its best endeavours to ensure that the
services
were set up and fully operational "on the telephone numbers", i.e. the
telephone numbers referred to in clause 1(a); and to ensure,
speaking
generally, that everything was done necessary to maintain the telephone lines
in a fully operational manner.
<P>

95   	The next submission was that the undertakings and
agreements of Legion were related to "the Service(s)": clauses 1(b), (c)
and
(g), and that clause 4(a) defined revenue as the amount calculated by Legion as
being due from Telecom using "the call logging
equipment for each number
allocated to the services(s) and for the period as specified in Schedule 1".
<P>

96   	Accordingly, it was submitted, Legion's obligations
included the provision of access to telephone lines as required by clause
1(a)
and the use by Legion of its best endeavours to ensure that the Services were
set up and fully operational on those telephone
numbers, so that revenue could
be determined in relation to "each number allocated" to the Service.  It was
noted that the parties
may agree to change the Service name from time to time
as they saw fit, and reliance was then placed on the method for the
distribution
of revenue.
<P>

97   	It was submitted that the construction of clause 1(k) for
which Global contended would lead to a commercially irrational result,
which
the parties could not possibly have contemplated.  The evidence was that there
were various people offering psychic and psychic-related
readings to members of
the public, such people operating under various names.  If calls for a psychic,
other than one promoted by
Global, were directed to a Global operator the
member of the public would have the call answered by an operator from whom that
person
was not seeking a reading.
<P>

98   	Mr Stevenson submitted that clause 1(k) was inserted in
the context that Gobal had expressed an interest in respect of the
then
contemplated Star Cards promotion involving Athena Starwoman and Woman's Day;
that Global was also interested in processing
work for any on-going promotion
with Athena Starwoman and Woman's Day; and that although there had been
discussions as to whether
that would be possible, it was clear to Mr Lovell
that such a result would depend upon whether Athena Starwoman was agreeable
and,
if she was not, that would be an end of the matter.  Thus, it was
submitted, not only did the exception relate to the "one-off" promotion
referred to in clause 1(k), but also to any "on-going" arrangement with Athena
Starwoman.  This submission was added to the submission
that the obligation
imposed by clause 1(k), if Global's construction was correct, would be to refer
all psychic or psychic-related
call processing requests received by Legion,
even for one of Global's competitors, to the Global operator.  It was said that
this
would impose on Legion an obligation to act in breach of its contractual
obligations to other clients; to put calls through to Global's
call processing
centres, which were intended for those of Global's competitors; and to subvert
the intention of the callers on the
190 Other Lines by directing calls from the
chosen psychics to one of Global's psychics.
<P>

99   	In response to this it was submitted that it is immaterial
that by contracting with other parties, Legion may have put its
capacity to
perform its contractual obligations with Global beyond its control without
breaching other contracts.
<P>

100   	Mr Stevenson submitted that the result for which Global
contended was that Legion could only contract with, for example,
Athena
Starwoman, on terms that any calls received in response to her advertisements
would be processed by Global, which submission
he said amounted to a suggestion
that, on its proper construction the agreement obliged Legion to engage in
unlawful activity, namely
third line forcing contrary to ss.45 and 47(6), (7)
and (10) of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> 1974.
<P>

101   	Mr Stevenson referred to various authorities relating to
the poor quality of drafting of an agreement and the necessity to
give the
agreement commercial effect: <b>Mitzui Construction Co Limited v Attorney
General of Hong Kong</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2033%20BLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 33 Build LR 1</a>; <b>Antaios Cia Navierasa v Salen

would the add the frequently cited reference to the decision of Gibbs J in
<b>Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right
Association Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a> at p.109.
<P>

102   	It is obvious that the poor drafting of the Agreement
leads to difficulties in its ultimate construction and, I have no doubt,
different minds may differ as to the correct or, perhaps I should say, the
appropriate construction.  I have come to the conclusion
that the construction
for which Mr Brereton contends is to be preferred for the following
reasons:-
<P>

(i)	The mutually known factual matrix against the background of which the
Agreement was entered into was the desire by Global for
an exclusive agreement
and the willingness of Legion to give that, save for the exception to which it
was committed.
<P>

(ii)	There was no suggestion of other contractual obligations on Legion for
providing for psychic and psychic-related services at
that time, so that there
was no other contractual reasons why Legion could not provide exclusivity.
<P>

(iii)	Clause 1(k) is unambiguous in its terms.  It provides that "all" stated
call requests would be directed through Global's Call
Centre, save for only one
exception.  The use of the word "all" and the provision of the exception points
powerfully to the result
I favour.
<P>

(iv)	Clause 1(k) differs from the obligation cast on Global by clause 2(c),
because whilst Global agrees to work for Legion on an
exclusive basis for the
services detailed in Schedule 1 and to give Legion first option for related
services, there is no obligation
on Legion to take up the option, so that
another service bureau could do so.  Thus, there is no obligation on Global to
direct "all"
its related services through Legion, which adds to the strength of
the word "all", supported by the exception, in clause 1(k).
<P>

(v)	The Agreement, read as a whole, is one for the provision of services by
Legion to Global and by Global to Legion for which each
will receive
remuneration.  Save, possibly for the division of payments, there is no
suggestion that any other party will acquire
any rights (except in the case of
an assignment or sale).
<P>

(vi)	The "Revenue Deals" should be construed in the way for which Mr Brereton
contended.  They follow the obligation to make payment
in clause 4(a).  The
word "solely" will not, in my opinion, do the work of creating exclusivity for
which Mr Stevenson submitted.
 It is, to paraphrase Mr Brereton's submission
which I have set out, intended to govern the function of "Call Centre" and
"Service
Bureau" as a separate contractual activity from pursuing independent
promotional opportunities.
<P>

(vii)	To give clause 1(k) a more restricted meaning would be to relegate it to
stating the contractual obligations of the parties
but, in doing so, to write
out the word "all".  There is no justification for taking this step.
<P>

103   	In so far as regard may be had to subsequent events in
construing the Agreement, I consider they are consistent with the
view to which
I have come.  However, they are not matters on which I have to rely because,
for the reasons I have given, I am satisfied
that clause 1(k) imposed
obligations on Legion to direct all the specified calls on 190 numbers to
Global.  In so far as it did not
it was in breach of the Agreement.
<P>

104   	For the reasons I have given I accept that the Agreement
did provide for the exclusivity for which Global contended.
<P>

<b>Was The Agreement Varied?</b>
<P>

105   	Legion has pleaded that the Agreement was varied in the
manner alleged in paragraph 9 of its Defence.  Its submission was
that the
letter of 16 March 1995 was an offer by it, in the context of its complaint
about failed calls and low margin, to amend
paragraph 1 of the Revenue Deal in
terms which would provide it with a higher percentage of the revenue in
circumstances where it
was pursuing independent promotional opportunities and,
thereby, allow it "to recommence its advertising programme hopefully to the
benefit of all".  Assuming that that was an offer capable of acceptance,
Global, in its letter of 29 March 1995, did not accept it
but, rather, made
what could be described as a counter offer.  Firstly, it was prepared to accept
the revised Schedule on a three
month trial basis beginning on 1 April 1995
with a review at the end of that period.  Secondly, it was only prepared to
agree to
that, which in any event was a variation of the offer made by Legion,
if the Agreement was amended to allow Global to have "non-exclusivity
as a call
processing centre".  The reasons put forward for this amendment were that
Legion was not abiding by the exclusivity provision
and had continued to
establish its own processing centre in direct competition to that of Global;
that an exclusive call processing
centre for Legion was not viable; and that to
continue to allocate time and resources to the business Global must pursue "by
whatever
means" a consistent level of call volume that allowed efficiencies
from the economies of scale.
<P>

106   	The letter of 31 March 1995 from Legion replied to a
number of matters raised by Global, and asserted that the main cause
of the
problem was insufficient operators resulting in too many unanswered calls.  The
letter stated, as I have noted, the assumption
that the removal of exclusivity
would apply to both parties, and Legion's understanding of Global's desire to
work with other service
providers to build volume.  The letter continued that
Legion was very concerned that that would reduce Global's level of services
and
increase the number of failed calls, and disputed the business wisdom of having
a number of service bureaus for Global including
"it will not be long before a
number of callers realise that the same operators are working across different
services".
<P>

107   	The letter also referred to various operational issues,
and continued:-
<P>

<b>"These are real concerns that will have to be addressed immediately if
Legion Telecall is going to continue to switch calls to your
bureau.</b>
<P>

<b>Legion Telecall is committed to the success of psychic services.  We do
believe that these services are in their infancy in Australia,
and we are
probably one of the only Service Provider's (sic) with the media and the
financial backing to ensure success that the
service is optimised.</b>
<P>

<b>We are prepared to talk further on how an exclusive two way arrangement can
benefit both our companies.  This would require you to
run and advertise all
your services through Legion Telecall, and in return Legion Telecall to fully
support the services run through
your bureau.</b>
<P>

<b>We would have to very carefully consider your suggested approach to
supporting a number of Service Provider's (sic), this would require
you to
fully explain the bureau operation and to guarantee a level of service to
Legion Telecall.  In your response please also consider
the financial support
and advertising you would give to your own services facilitated by each Service
Provider given your stated
financial position."</b>
<P>

108   	Mr Stevenson conceded that the question as to any
variation was left open by the correspondence, and that this was the situation
which obtained at the time of the conference on 7 April 1995.
<P>

109   	In his written submissions Mr Stevenson stated that in
its letter of 31 March 1995, Legion indicated tentative agreement
to the
proposal for the revision of Schedule 1, provided Global could be released from
its obligation of exclusivity under clause
2(c) "provided that all obligations
of exclusivity (including such obligations as may be imposed on Legion under
clause 1(k)) would
be removed".  The submission continued that accepting that
that question was left open by Legion's letter of 31 March 1995 and at
the
meeting of 7 April 1995, none-the-less Legion by making all post-March 1995
payments to Global in respect of  Psychic Live services
at the rates set out in
the letter of 16 March 1995, rather than those set out in the Agreement knowing
that Global would only agree
to accept payment at those lower rates if it were
released from its obligation of exclusivity under clause 2(c), was accepting
Global's
proposal that it be released from that obligation of exclusivity; and
that Global, by accepting such reduced payments without demur
and knowing that
Legion would only release Global from its obligations of exclusivity under
clause 2(c) if Global released Legion
from such obligations as Legion owed
under clause 1(k), agreed to release Legion from any such obligation of
exclusivity.
<P>

110   	The submissions continued that the variation took place
in April 1995 or, on the view of the evidence most favourable to
Global, by
July 1995, and that from April 1995 Global started to wind down "the
advertising of Global through Legion"; and that from
1 March 1995 Global
commenced its "flirtation" with IDS, which continued and was consummated by
July 1995 when Global offered its
psychic capability to IDS.  By then Mr Lovell
believed that such obligation of exclusivity as Global might have had under the
Agreement
had been discharged: Tp.35.
<P>

111   	It was submitted on behalf of Global, and so much was not
in issue, that the correspondence did not bring about a variation.
 The
question then was what effect the meeting of 7 April 1995 had.  Global relied
on Mr Burden's evidence.  Commencing at Tp.152,
he agreed that the question of
exclusivity was raised at that meeting and that he told Mr Lovell he would have
to speak to Mr Maxted,
his superior at Legion, and "get back" to Mr Lovell.  He
said the matter he was intending to discuss with Mr Maxted was whether Global
could use or take calls from other service bureaus.  He agreed, Tp.153, that Mr
Lovell raised the obligations of Legion to deal with
Global exclusively, and
that he complained that calls were not being directed to Global.  Mr Burden
said that he believed the matter
to be taken up with Mr Maxted was in regard to
Global's exclusivity to provide calls to other service bureaus, and that he
left the
meeting of 7 April 1995 believing that he would have to again speak to
Mr Lovell about the whole question of exclusivity.  He said:-
<P>

<b>"I think it was fair to say, your Honour, when I left that meeting, Global
had made it pretty clear that they wanted to work with
other people and I left
that meeting pretty much with that firmly in my mind."</b>
<P>

112   	On the basis of this evidence there was no agreement as
at 7 April 1995 in relation to exclusivity, save that Mr Burden would
communicate again with Mr Lovell after consulting with Mr Maxted.  Mr Burden
did not do so.
<P>

113   	Mr Brereton submitted that Legion argued that the
variation was effected by its sending a payment to Global at rates it knew
Global would accept only if released from exclusivity, and Global's acceptance
of payment at the lower rate knowing that Legion would
release it from
exclusivity only if Global reciprocated, thereby accepted the offer.
<P>

114   	The submission continued:-
<P>

<b>"This amounts to an alleged implied acceptance of an implied offer in
circumstances where the parties had addressed the issue expressly
and not
reached agreement.  An agreement to vary should not be implied in such
circumstances.  But there is an even stronger reason
for not implying such an
agreement: Global's acceptance of payment at the lower rate is just as
consistent with Global accepting
a variation only in respect of the revenue
share, as it is in respect of exclusivity.  And that is the far more likely
explanation,
given the history of negotiations between the parties to that
point."</b>
<P>

115   	In my opinion a consideration of the correspondence and
what transpired at the meeting of 7 April 1995, when Mr Burden was
clearly
taken by surprise by the terms of the Agreement, leads to the conclusion that
the parties were still in a state of negotiation
and, certainly, there was no
concluded agreement for a variation of the type for which Legion contended, but
only as to the rate
of payment.
<P>

116   	In the result I do not accept that the Agreement was
varied, save to the extent to which I have referred.  It may well be
that the
parties were acting in breach of it, but that is an entirely different thing to
an assertion that there was an agreement
whereby it was varied.
<P>

<b>Waiver</b>
<P>

117   	In so far as a defence of waiver was raised, Mr Stevenson
said that there was no additional argument, apart from that of
variation, the
waiver alleged being a waiver of Global's right to enforce clause 1(k) if it
had the meaning for which Mr Brereton
contended.
<P>

<b>Repudiation</b>
<P>

118   	In paragraphs 11 and 12 of its Defence, Legion asserted
that during the period September to December 1995, Global, by its
conduct,
evinced an intention not to be bound by the Agreement, and that on or about 15
December 1995, Legion, by its conduct, accepted
Global's conduct as a
repudiation of the Agreement and terminated it.  The particulars of the
repudiatory conduct were failure to
ensure there would be sufficient operators
available to cover the services at all times in breach of clause 2(m) and to
maintain
service opening hours in breach of clause 2(l); and further the
provision of a totally inadequate level of service so as to provide
effectively
no service at all.  The acceptance of the alleged repudiation was pleaded as
having occurred in a telephone conversation
between Mr Burden and Mr Turnbull
on or about 15 December 1995.
<P>

119   	It does not appear that Mr Stevenson made any submissions
in respect of these allegations.  However, in his submissions in
relation to
abandonment, he referred to the decision of the High Court in <b>DTR Nominees
Pty Limited v Mona Homes Pty Limited &amp; Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20138%20CLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 138 CLR 423.</a>  That
case concerned the right to rescind for breach of an essential term and, at
p.434, in the joint judgment of Stephen, Mason
and Jacobs JJ it dealt with the
question of abandonment.
<P>

120   	Mr Brereton relied on the fact that no submission had
been made in relation to repudiation and, notwithstanding that that
submission
was repeated, there was no further submission by Mr Stevenson on this point.
In all these circumstances I do not propose
to stay to consider the point
pleaded, but not argued, particularly as specific reference was made by Mr
Brereton to the failure
to make submissions on it.  However, at the end of the
day, it may well be that the findings I make in relation to the alleged
breaches
will be such as to show that there was no breach of a repudiatory type
by Global.
<P>

121   	The matters pleaded in paragraph 13 of the Defence were
abandoned expressly.
<P>

<b>Abandonment</b>
<P>

122   	Mr Stevenson submitted that by 15 December 1995 the
parties had agreed to abandon their respective rights and obligations
under the
Agreement in that from about 16 September 1995 Global ceased to arrange for
operators to log onto Legion's equipment and/or
ceased to arrange for them to
take calls on the 190 Listed Lines; and, on 15 December 1995, Legion
disconnected Global's access to
the 190 Listed Lines.
<P>

123   	The passage upon which Mr Stevenson relied in <b>DTR
Nominees</b>, at p.434, stated:-
<P>

<b>"Thus the contract in the present case was still on foot on and after 25
July 1974.  Neither party had effectively rescinded.  But
there can be no doubt
that by 5 December 1974, when these proceedings were commenced, neither party,
whatever may have been their
reasons, regarded the contract as being still on
foot.  Neither party intended that the contract should be further performed.
In
these circumstances the parties must be regarded as having so conducted
themselves as to abandon or abrogate the contract.  The position
is similar to
that with which Isaacs J dealt in <i>Summers v The Commonwealth</i>.  The
plaintiff did not succeed in his action for damages for breach of contract, but
on the other hand the defendant had not rescinded.
 Time passed during which
neither party took any steps to perform the contract.  It was held that the
parties had so conducted themselves
as mutually to abandon or abrogate the
contract."</b>
<P>

124   	Mr Stevenson submitted that by the end of November 1995
Global had ceased to promote any service through Legion and to answer
calls on
the 190 Listed Lines, and that the effect of that conduct was that abandonment
took place on 15 December 1995, so that if
there was otherwise an entitlement
to damages it ceased then.
<P>

125   	I am not satisfied that there was any agreement, whether
express or implied, by the parties that the Agreement should be
abandoned.  It
will be necessary to consider the evidence relevant to the alleged breaches of
contract by Global to ascertain what
steps it took in performing its
contractual obligations.  In my view the claim based on abandonment must
fail.
<P>

<b>The Giving Of Reasonable Notice</b>
<P>

126   	Mr Stevenson relied upon the fact that it was an implied
term of the Agreement that either party was entitled to terminate
it on giving
reasonable notice to the other, such term being implied to give business
efficacy to the Agreement.  He submitted that
although no notice was given
seven days would have been a reasonable period because the parties had ceased
to be in contractual relations.
<P>

127   	Mr Brereton relied upon clause 5(b) of the Agreement,
which provided:-
<P>

<b>"If any party fails to comply with the terms of this agreement then the
other parties may give the party in default thirty days notice
in writing in
which to rectify such non-compliance.  If after thirty days such non-compliance
has not been rectified then the complaining
parties may terminate this
agreement forthwith by giving written notice of such termination."</b>
<P>

128   	The implication of the term, for which Mr Stevenson
contended, can only arise if, inter alia, it does not contradict an express
term of the Agreement.  In my opinion clause 5(b) provides that if there is
breach, including breach of the terms of clauses 2(l)
and (m) in the manner
alleged, the Agreement required Legion to give notice to Global to rectify the
default within 30 days and,
in the event of its not being rectified, it was
then open to Legion to terminate the Agreement.  This term, in my opinion, is
contradictory
of the term sought to be implied.
<P>

129   	Further, it seems to me that clause 5(b) also justifies
the view that a minimum period of notice is 30 days.  However, clause
5(a)
provided that the parties are to review "the situation", i.e. the duration of
the Agreement, "at regular three monthly intervals".
<P>

130   	Mr Brereton submitted that the effect of clause 5(a) was
to deal with the Agreement's duration, save as provided in clause
5(b), and
that, on its proper construction and in the absence of a notice under clause
5(b), the Agreement could not be terminated
in the absence of breach save on
three months' notice.  Alternatively, he submitted, that if the Agreement was
terminable on reasonable
notice, the circumstances required not less than three
months' notice because, inter alia, of the lead time for advertising of two
to
three months; the circumstance that the Agreement contained provision for three
monthly reviews; and the inference to be drawn
from the fact that in the case
of breach a 30 day notice requiring rectification was necessary before the
Agreement could be terminated
thus leading to the conclusion that a
substantially longer period would be expected in the absence of a breach
justifying termination.
<P>

<b>Conclusions Thus Far</b>
<P>

131   	Global was entitled, upon a proper construction of the
Agreement, to the exclusivity for which it contended.  There was no
variation
of the Agreement in the way for which Legion contended.  The questions, which
arise therefrom, are the damages to which
it is entitled.  Further questions
will arise as to whether, in consequence of any alleged breaches by Global,
Legion is entitled
to damages.
<P>

132   	<b>Damages For The Failure To Provide All Calls To
Global</b>
<P>

Global submitted that its damages are the amount of remuneration to which it
would have been entitled had Legion directed all 190
psychic and
psychic-related call processing requests through its psychic call centre, other
than the current one-off Athena Starwoman
- Woman's Day Star Cards Promotion.
It submitted that the damages should be calculated to March 1996 because Legion
could not, as
it purported to do, have lawfully terminated the Agreement on 15
December 1995, but was required to give three months' notice from
that date,
for the reasons to which I have just referred, thus meaning that it could not
have terminated in the absence of breach
before 15 March 1996.  This submission
was supported by submissions that no notice pursuant to clause 5(b) was given
to Global, so
that Legion was not entitled to terminate for breach; that in
those circumstances, for the reasons earlier submitted, the Agreement
was
terminable on three months' notice; and, alternatively, it was terminable on
reasonable notice which, in the circumstances, was
three months.
<P>

133   	The submissions continued that had Legion honoured its
contractual obligations, Global would have been entitled to its revenue
share
in respect of the calls not directed to it at the rate provided for in Part 1
of the Revenue Schedule, until 31 March 1995,
and thereafter as varied by the
correspondence of March 1995.  Global accepted that as Athena, Mystic Meg and
Myles lines were not
promoted by it, Part 1 of the Revenue Schedule was
applicable and, further, that the correspondence of March 1995 effected a
variation,
with effect from 1 April 1995, of the Revenue Share Deal, although
not of exclusivity.  The relevant figures are set forth in the
letter of 16
March 1995.
<P>

134   	The submissions continued that certain calls to Athena,
Mystic Meg and Myles were on $5 and $3.95 lines, and that the Agreement
did not
directly address calls at such charge rates.  Reference was then made to clause
4(a), which dealt firstly with calls at $3
per minute and concluded:-
<P>

<b>"However, the call charges are subject to change and hence the amount
retained by Legion and subsequently Global will be subject to
this
change."</b>
<P>

135   	The submission was that the changes to $5 and $3.95 per
minute meant that the call charges had been changed, as contemplated
in that
sentence, and that, consequentially on that change, there was to be a change in
the amount retained by Legion and subsequently
Global; and that the clear
intention evidenced by this sentence was that in the event of call charges
being changed the amounts to
be distributed to Legion and Global would alter
proportionately in accordance with the original division of call charges.
There seemed
to be no significant difference in the submissions on this point,
save that Mr Stevenson submitted that there was only an agreement
to enter into
a further agreement.
<P>

136   	Mr Stevenson submitted that in considering damages, on
the basis that the construction of the Agreement for which he contended
was not
accepted, it was necessary, firstly, to have regard to the fact that Legion
only failed to direct the relevant calls on the
190 Other Lines amounting to
1,125,447 minutes.  The submission continued that on the construction of the
Agreement, which I consider
is correct, Global is entitled to damages
sufficient to put it in the position it would have been had Legion directed
calls on those
lines, being specifically those to Athena Starwoman, Mystic Meg
and Myles, to Global, and the submission posed the question rhetorically
as to
what would have happened if Legion had attempted to do so.  The evidence was
that Athena Starwoman, Mystic Meg and Myles were
competitors of Global and had
their own call processing centres.  Further, it established that Athena
Starwoman had been approached
by Legion with the suggestion that Global's
psychics be used, a matter she considered to be "unwise" and about which she
would be
"most apprehensive" to lend her name.  Legion also approached Mystic
Meg and, when she ultimately commenced operations in November
1995, she used
Myles as her call processor.
<P>

137   	From this the submission ran that it is obvious that
these people would have become aware if Legion had put their calls through
to
Global operators, and that it is "inconceivable" that they would have "been
prepared to tolerate that conduct" and that if Legion
had persisted in it they
would have terminated their arrangements with it pursuant to their contractual
arrangements with Legion.
<P>

138   	Mr Stevenson submitted that the onus is on Global, as is
obviously correct, to prove the quantum of its damages, and that
it had not
adduced any evidence to establish that any of these persons, all of whom were
Global competitors, would have allowed calls
intended for their services to be
directed to Global.  He submitted the evidence was to the contrary and the
probabilities favour
the view, which was otherwise established by the evidence,
that these people would have rejected Global as the call centre.
<P>

139   	There was evidence, to which Mr Stevenson's written
submissions referred, that callers would have realised they were being
connected to operators other than those of their choice and that:-
<P>

<b>"In all these circumstances it is highly improbable that Global would have
generated any income from the calls it claims Legion was
obliged to direct to
it."</b>
<P>

140   	Mr Stevenson further submitted that Global's case assumed
an inability to handle the vastly increased number of calls without
any
increase in overhead costs, "merely because the operators logged on to the
Psychic Express and Psychic Live service were not
fully occupied".  The
submission referred to the evidence of Ms Ramzan that Global's "business rule"
was that its operators would
log on to only one service at any given time,
because otherwise "not all services could be dealt with adequately".  The
submission
was that Global had not demonstrated that it could have engaged
sufficient operators to meet "such an extraordinary increase in demand",
and
that Global is merely asking the Court to either infer "or, more accurately, to
speculate" that it could have done so.  These
submissions concluded that Global
suffered no loss, let alone the amount claimed.
<P>

141   	Mr Stevenson's submissions then turned to calls charged
at $5 per minute and, I shall assume, these were also intended to
cover any
calls at $3.95 per minute.  He submitted that Global's contention that it was
entitled to the benefit of an increase in
call charges "is inconsistent with
clause 4(a) ... which, properly construed, requires there to be further
agreement between Global
and Legion, in the event of an increase in call
charge", and that absent any such agreement Global had no entitlement to any
increase.
 I do not agree with this submission.  In my opinion, the concluding
sentence of clause 4(a) does not require a further agreement.
 It provides the
agreement of the parties as to what shall happen in the event of a change in
call charges and provides that the
amounts to be retained "will be subject to
this change".  It is not difficult to imagine a more expanded method of stating
what was
intended.  However, a fair reading of the provision is that in the
event of a change in call charges, whether upwards or downwards,
Legion is to
be paid a percentage, on those adjusted figures, that $2.45 bears to $3, and
the share of the revenue to be divided
is to be calculated on the basis of the
changed figure, but by reference to the percentages appearing in the revenue
provision of
Schedule 1 and the subsequent correspondence.
<P>

142   	Mr Stevenson continued that if, contrary to that
submission, Global was entitled to increased revenue, such increase should
be
such amount as would give Global the same proportion of the charge rate had
there been no increase "and not a `proportionate share
of any increase'".
<P>

143   	Mr Brereton submitted that there was no justification for
discounting the amount of damages to which Global was entitled
based on
insufficient capacity to cope with the increased level of calls.  He submitted
Global had ample capacity and relied on the
evidence of Ms Ramzan to this
effect.  In my opinion the evidence does establish that Global had the
necessary capacity to handle
an increased volume of calls.
<P>

144   	Mr Brereton then turned to consider whether the other
people would have agreed to Global's handling their calls, and the
submission
that it was improbable that they would have.  He submitted this completely
misunderstood the approach to damages in contract,
as distinct from tort,  the
question being simply what would have happened had the Agreement been
performed, this not being a case
where one had to question whether the calls
would have been made at all.
<P>

145   	To this point I do not discern any great difference
between the submissions.
<P>

146   	Mr Brereton then submitted that the question "becomes
simply, what would Global have earnt had they been directed to Global",
and
that the question as to whether Athena Starwoman, Mystic Meg or Myles would
have allowed calls intended for their services to
be directed to Global does
not arise and that it was for Legion, if it decided to process such calls, to
ensure that it was able
to direct them to Global to perform its contractual
obligations to Global.
<P>

147   	In my opinion there are two issues involved in these
various submissions.  Firstly, for the reasons I have sought to explain,
I am
of the opinion that Legion was obliged to direct all calls to Global operators.
However, this would have led to two potential
difficulties so far as the 190
Other Lines were concerned.  Firstly, there would, I am satisfied by the
evidence, have been a very
real probability that Athena Starwoman, Mystic Meg
and Myles would have terminated their arrangements with Legion.  Secondly, the
submission overlooked the fact that a critical aspect of the revenue raising
was that callers would remain on the line.  The proper
inference from the
evidence is that the callers, or indeed the vast majority of them, were seeking
to speak to a person of their
choice.  They were not simply seeking to speak to
any operator.  This observation is not overcome by the fact that a person
ringing
Psychic Live or Psychic Express may receive one of a number of
operators, because such people were content to have the service operating
under
one or other of those names.  But it does not follow, and indeed the evidence
is to the contrary, that a person telephoning,
for example, Psychic Express or
Psychic Live would be prepared to accept a service provided by, for example,
Athena Starwoman or
Mystic Meg, and the converse position must be so.   I am
satisfied that the evidence supports this.
<P>

148   	The total amount claimed by Global for this breach is
$1,054,902.18, which includes $4,896 for calls on Psychic Express directed
to
Mystic Meg.  In my view the proper way to approach this claim, having regard to
the difficulties confronting Global in relation
to Athena Starwoman, Mystic Meg
and Myles remaining with Legion and callers being prepared to accept Global's
operators, is on the
basis of damages for loss of opportunity to have received
and taken advantage of such calls.  The issue, in the context of a tortious
claim, was considered by the High Court in <b>Malec v J.C. Hutton Pty
Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a>, particularly at pp.642-645 in the joint
judgment of Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.  It was considered in the context of
a claim for
damages under the Trade Practices Act in <b>Sellars v Adelaide
Petroleum NL &amp; Ors</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 332.</a> 
<P>

149   	In the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and
Gaudron JJ, their Honours said, at pp.339-340:-
<P>

<b>"The primary question is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the
loss of an opportunity to obtain a commercial advantage or
benefit amounts to
`loss or damage' within s.82(1).  Is it necessary for the applicant to prove on
the balance of probabilities that
a benefit would have been derived from the
opportunity had it not been lost and, if so, the extent of that benefit?  Or is
it sufficient
for the applicant to show, not on a balance of probabilities, but
by reference to the degree of possibilities and probabilities,
that there was
some prospects of deriving a benefit from the opportunity had it not been lost
and, if so, then to ascertain the value
of the opportunity or benefit by
reference to such possibilities and probabilities?  The question whether the
applicant has sustained
loss or damage is necessarily related to the
ascertainment or measurement of that loss or damage."</b>
<P>

150   	At p.349 their Honours said:-
<P>

<b>"In the realm of contract law, the loss of a chance to win a prize in a
competition resulting from breach of a contract to provide
the chance is
compensable, notwithstanding that, on the balance of probabilities, it is more
likely than not that the plaintiff would
not win the competition.  As the
contract contained a promise to provide the chance, the breach of the contract
resulted in the loss
of the chance and that loss was for relevant purposes an
actual loss, in the sense in which Dixon and McTiernan JJ used that expression
in <i>Fink v Fink</i>.  And where there has been an actual loss of some sort,
the common law does not permit difficulties of estimating the loss in money
to
defeat an award of damages.  The damages will then be ascertained by reference
to the degree of probabilities, or possibilities,
inherent in the plaintiff's
succeeding had the plaintiff been given the chance which the contract
promised.</b>
<P>

<b>This approach is not confined to contracts relating to games of chance,
sporting contests or other competitions.  <i>Fink v Fink</i> concerned a
contract to provide an opportunity for a reconciliation, breach of which was
held to entitle the wife to damages.  And
there can be no doubt that a contract
to provide a commercial advantage or opportunity, if breached, enables the
innocent party to
bring an action for damages for the loss of that advantage or
opportunity.  So, in <i>The Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Limited</i>,
Mason CJ and Dawson J, Brennan J and Deane J concluded that a lost commercial
advantage or opportunity was a compensable loss, even
though there was a less
than fifty per cent likelihood that the commercial advantage would be realised.
Damages for breach of contract
were assessed by reference to the probabilities
or possibilities of what would have happened." </b>
<P>

151   	At p.350, after referring to <b>Malec</b>, their Honours
said:-
<P>

<b>"Neither in logic nor in the nature of things is there any reason for
confining the approach taken in <i>Malec</i> concerning the proof of future
possibilities and past hypothetical situations to the assessment of damages for
personal injuries.
 The reasons which commended the adoption of that approach
in assessments of that kind apply with equal force to the assessment of
damages
for loss of a commercial opportunity, as the judgments in <i>Amann</i>
acknowledge."</b>
<P>

152   	At p.355 their Honours said:-
<P>

<b>"Notwithstanding the observations of this Court in <i>Norwest</i>, we
consider that acceptance of the principle enunciated in <i>Malec</i> requires
that damages for deprivation of a commercial opportunity, whether the
deprivation occurred by reason of breach of contract,
or contravention of
s.52(1) should be ascertained by reference to the Court's assessment of the
prospects of success of that opportunity
had it been pursued. The principle
recognised in <i>Malec</i> was based on a consideration of the peculiar
difficulties associated with the proof and evaluation of future possibilities
and past
hypothetical fact situations, as contrasted with proof of historical
facts.  Once that is accepted, there is no secure foundation
for confining the
principle to cases of any particular kind.</b>
<P>

<b>On the other hand, the general standard of proof in civil actions will
ordinarily govern the issue of causation and the issue whether
the applicant
has sustained loss or damage.  Hence the applicant must prove on the balance of
probabilities that he or she has sustained
<i>some</i> loss or damage.
However, in a case such as the present, the applicant shows <i>some</i> loss or
damage was sustained by demonstrating that the contravening conduct caused the
loss of a commercial opportunity which had
<i>some</i> value (not being a
negligible value), the value being ascertained by reference to the degree of
probabilities or possibilities. 
It is no answer to that way of viewing an
applicant's case to say that the commercial opportunity was valueless on the
balance of
probabilities because to say that is to value the commercial
opportunity by reference to a standard of proof which is inapplicable."
 (Their
Honours' emphasis.)</b>
<P>

153   	Their Honours considered that this approach resulted in
fair compensation, whereas "the all or nothing outcome produced by
the civil
standard of proof would result in the vast majority of cases in
over-compensation or under-compensation to an applicant
who has been deprived
of a commercial opportunity".
<P>

154   	The matter, so far as I am aware, was most recently
considered by the Court of Appeal in <b>Tszyu v Fightvision Pty Limited &amp;
Anor<i> </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20NSWCA%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) NSWCA 323</a> (13 September 1999).  A boxing fight promoter
sought damages from, inter alios, a boxer, on the basis that but for his breach
of
contract he would have continued to fight in circumstances where the fight
promoter would have derived income.  The Court was necessarily
confronted with
the question as to what would have occurred but for the breach by the boxer of
his contract, which involved considerations
such as the number of fights in
which he would have been engaged, the profits to be derived from them, the
amount to which the promoter
would have been entitled from them, and the
inherent vicissitudes and contingencies that the underlying circumstances would
have
transpired necessary to enable the boxer to have engaged in such fights
before crowds and in circumstances where other income would
have been derived,
which would support the damages claimed.
<P>

155   	Their Honours noted that in that case causation did not
arise.  In my opinion, in the present case causation does not arise
because the
failure to direct the calls was the breach of contract and, in so far as there
was any loss, it was caused by that failure.

<P>

156   	At paragraphs 140 and 141 the Court of Appeal said:-
<P>

<b>"140	It would have been erroneous to apply a balance of probabilities test
to the programme and the earnings, treating as certain
the past hypothetical
events of promotion or co-operation by Fightvision of bouts in which Mr Tszyu
participated and earnings from
those bouts as put forward in the evidence of Mr
Mordey if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that those events would
have
occurred.  That would have then been unfair to the defendants, because it
would have treated as certain a prediction of events with
a 51% probability of
occurring.  It would equally have been unfair to Fightvision to have ignored
the events altogether, and so awarded
no damages, if the prediction of their
occurrence was given only a 49% probability.  The correct approach, given the
causation of
loss was not in issue and the task was to assess the damages for
loss of the commercial opportunity of promoting or co-promoting
fights in which
Mr Tszyu participated, was according to the degree of possibility or
probability of such bouts occurring and bringing
earnings as claimed.</b>
<P>

<b>  141	It is not essential, however, in making an assessment of damages of
this kind, to express a percentage possibility or probability
of the occurrence
of the events necessary for the claimed lost profits, here the number of fights
and the amounts of earnings."</b>
<P>

157   	In my opinion paragraph 141 was said in the context of
the particular findings at first instance in that case.  I do not
consider that
their Honours were suggesting that the application of a percentage amount,
which is a conventional approach to the
problem, was not permissible.
<P>

158   	Their Honours quoted with approval from the decision in
<b>Norris v Blake (No 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 49</a>, at p.67:-
<P>

<b>"Where a valuation of a loss has to be made and the extent of the loss
depends upon an uncertain event, which has not occurred by
the time the
evaluation is made, such evaluation must be made by reference to the chance of
the event occurring, and not by reference
to whether or not the occurrence was
or is probable."</b>
<P>

159   	At paragraph 144 they continued:-
<P>

<b>"So where there is controversy over the validity of a hypothetical exercise
of earning capacity, or hypothetical events necessary
for claimed lost profits,
being the hypothesis for which the plaintiff contends, to say that it is more
probable than not that something
less than that for which the plaintiff
contends would have occurred may be a way of allowing for imponderables or
chances and coming
to the degree of probability of that for which the plaintiff
contends.  In substance, that is what was done in <i>Norris v Blake (No 2)</i>,
although with further allowance for the particular prospect of greater
success."  </b>
<P>

160   	In my opinion, these authorities set forth the proper
approach to the assessment of the damages with which I am now dealing.
 The
evidence does not establish that had Legion directed the 190 Other Line calls
to Global, Global would have derived anything
like the full financial advantage
it claims from them.  Rather, I am satisfied that had this been done Athena
Starwoman, Mystic Meg
and Myles would have terminated their arrangements with
Legion, so that there would have been no calls on the 190 Other Lines to
be
directed to Global operators.  Further, I am satisfied that most, if not all,
the callers would, in all probability, not have
accepted other services than
those to which they were seeking to be connected.  However, there are two
qualifications in this.  The
first is that it would have taken some little time
for Athena Starwoman, Mystic Meg and Myles to terminate their respective
arrangements
with Legion.  The second is that there is the possibility that
some callers would have accepted the Global operators.  I am not prepared,
using the example in <b>Malec</b>, to conclude that these possibilities were so
remote that no assessment could be made of the lost opportunity by virtue of
the breach
of contract.  On the other hand, I am by no means satisfied that the
situation would have continued for long and, of course, once
Athena Starwoman,
Mystic Meg and Myles ceased their contractual arrangements with Legion, there
would have been little possibility
that callers to them would have accepted
Global operators because they could not have been directed to them.  I say
"little" in recognition
of the fact that there was still advertising material
available, which may have led to calls, which may, in turn, have led to some
callers accepting Global operators.  None-the-less, Global is entitled to be
recompensed, on the principles to which I have referred,
for the loss of the
opportunity.
<P>

161   	The Schedule, on the basis of which the damages have been
calculated, could be used as some guide to the amount.  The amounts
claimed for
the months of January, February, March and April 1995 respectively are
$32,524.40, $40,049.92, $45,947.53 and $51,384.98
of which Global claims an
entitlement to $7,590.75, $16,566.60, $15,589.05, $19,824.15 and $17,309.
These figures total approximately
$76,880.
<P>

162   	I have taken this figures as a check against the
percentage of the claim of $1,050,006 (i.e. $1,054,902.18 less $4,896),
which,
in my opinion, would be appropriate.  In my view the percentage is 10% and,
accordingly, the amount of damages to which Global
is entitled, under this
head, is $105,000.
<P>

163   	It was not in issue that, in addition to this amount,
Legion was obliged to pay Global the bad debt retention levy of $10,868.53
and
$4,896 for Legion's admitted re-direction of calls on the Psychic Express
service to Mystic Meg.  In the result I consider that
Global is entitled to
damages in the sum of $120,764.53.
<P>

164   	The assessment I have made also takes account of the view
expressed by Mr Lovell, paragraph 65 above, that such obligation
of exclusivity
as Global might have had was discharged by July 1995, when read with his
re-examination on this point.
<P>

<b>Legion's Claim For Damages On The Cross-Claim</b>
<P>

165   	Legion made several claims for damages under its
cross-claim.  The first alleged breaches of clauses 2(l) and (m) in that
for
the period from 1 April 1995 to 15 December 1995 Global failed to maintain
service opening hours and to ensure that there were
sufficient operators
available to cover the service at all times and, for the period from 1
September 1995 to 15 December 1995, the
service provided by Global "was totally
inadequate so as to effectively provide no service at all".
<P>

166   	The particulars alleged that for the period from 1 April
to 15 December 1995 Global's operators failed to answer a total
of 97,568 calls
to the service and, during the months from September to December 1995, its
operators failed to log in to the service
on whole dates thereby failing to
answer calls on those days.  The particulars alleged that the number of days
were 30, 31, 30 and
15 in September, October, November and December
respectively.  It was pleaded that as a result of these breaches Legion has
suffered
loss and damage. 
<P>

167   	Mr Stevenson submitted that there had been a breach of
sub-clauses 2(l) and (m) as a result of which Global had repudiated
its
obligations under the Agreement, and Legion had suffered damage and is entitled
to damages.  The submission continued that it
was clear that Global did not
maintain service opening hours throughout the course of the Agreement, and
reference was made to Mr
Turnbull's evidence that he told Mr Burden, on or
about 15 December 1997, that Global had stopped attending the lines:-
<P>

<b>".. because our psychics were fed up with being at a desk for four hours at
a time and not getting any calls."</b>
<P>

168   	Mr Stevenson referred to an answer to particulars in
which the solicitors for Global stated that no operators were logged
on after
16 September 1995, and to Schedule JB4 to Mr Bailey's statement of 22 September
1999, which revealed that between 16 September
1995 and 15 December 1995 no
operators were logged on for 51 days out of 91 days.  This would tend to
indicate that the answer to
the particulars: Exhibit 11, was incorrect, the
correct position, as disclosed by the evidence, being that there were operators
logged
on for some periods after 16 September 1995.
<P>

169   	Mr Stevenson submitted nextly that it was to be inferred
from the pattern and extent of call failures and unanswered calls
that Global
ceased to maintain service opening hours and to ensure sufficient operators
were available.
<P>

170   	He submitted that Global's obligation to ensure the
availability of sufficient operators was expressed to be "based on" a
supply of
"call statistics" and "operator management information", which Legion was
obliged to supply pursuant to clause 1(c), and
which it did supply in monthly
statements sent by it to Global, which set out, in relation to each line, the
number of calls and
the total number of minutes of those calls and thus
provided sufficient information to enable Global to determine how many
operators
were necessary. 
<P>

171   	Mr Stevenson also submitted that Legion provided Global
with operator call reports, although he accepted that none were furnished
after
23 August 1995.
<P>

172   	A great deal of evidence was given in relation to failed
and unanswered calls.  It was submitted that the source of information
in
relation to these calls came from Legion's computer records and that the two
questions which arose were whether the information
was accurate and what
conclusions should be drawn from it.
<P>

173   	Mr Stevenson submitted that Legion's relevant records had
been subjected "to rigorous and critical scrutiny" by Mr Murrell,
who was
called to give evidence by Global, and by Mr Simpson, who was retained by
Global but was not called.  Mr Stevenson noted
that Mr Murrell had sought to
impugn the integrity of the data in the records, but he submitted that
cross-examination revealed that
this attempt failed and that Global had failed
to establish that the records were inaccurate.  He further submitted that
ultimately,
albeit reluctantly, Mr Murrell conceded that there was no error in
the records themselves.  Mr Murrell also made an allegation that
Legion's
records had been subjected to a process of auto dialling, which allegation was
withdrawn during the hearing.
<P>

174   	Mr Stevenson submitted that if Legion's records showed a
call failed "it clearly did fail", the question being the reason
for that.  He
accepted that for there to be a relevant call failure it must be demonstrated
that it occurred when a call was received,
and no operator was available to
take the call because either no operators were logged on at all, or all
operators logged on were
"blocked out", i.e. were engaged on other calls, the
answer depending upon the proper analysis of Legion's records.
<P>

175   	Mr Bailey carried out an analysis of the records for
Legion.  He made various statements and responded to criticisms of his
analysis
offered by Messrs Murrell and Simpson by adjusting his conclusions in relation
to call failures and unanswered calls.  Mr
Stevenson, as I understood it,
accepted that this provided a basis for criticism of Mr Bailey's analysis, but
that subject to that
the resulting figures should be accepted as accurate.  He
submitted that from Mr Bailey's figures there was a total of 1,333 calls
on
both lines not answered and of 17,737, which failed, making a total of 19,070
calls.  Mr Brereton asked that that figure be contrasted
against the figure
originally claimed in the cross-claim of 97,568 calls and the figures
thereafter put forward by Mr Bailey leading
to his final figure of 19,070.  The
figure of 19,070 calls presented a problem, which Mr Stevenson frankly
accepted, arising from
the fact that an unspecified number of unanswered calls
may have occurred when an operator was logging out; the entries for 16
September
1995 and 17 October 1995 in Schedule JB3 to Mr Bailey's statement of
22 September 1999 disclosed negative numbers, which he said
should not have
occurred; and any further issue arising out of Exhibit Q with which Mr
Stevenson said he would deal in reply.
<P>

176   	One matter of criticism of Mr Bailey was that, prima
facie, his Schedule in reference to Exhibits JB2 and JB3 to his statement
of 22
September 1999 was inaccurate.  However, that inaccuracy was explained by a
wrong transposition of figures, which Mr Brereton
accepted.  Nothing more turns
on that, as such.
<P>

177   	Mr Stevenson also confronted evidence given by Mr Bailey,
at Tpp.229-230, in relation to the existence of the negative numbers.
 Mr
Bailey agreed that there should not be a negative number and that it appeared
to be a result of some programming error.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And your figures cannot be treated as reliable, can they?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It doesn't appear that is so, does it.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Q. If you go back to 16 September 1995, page 4 of 6.  Does the
same answer apply?</b>
<P>

<b>A.  Sorry, what is this one? </b>
<P>

<b>Q. Sorry, 16 September 1995, the previous page, does the same answer apply
about the validity of the figures?</b>
<P>

	<b>A. ...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. What I wanted to direct your attention to was 16 September where there
are three negative figures.  The question I just wanted
to ask you was does the
same answer apply as to the weight or reliability that can be placed upon your
figures, having regard to
those negative figures?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, they are wrong."</b>
<P>

178   	Mr Stevenson submitted that that evidence must be read as
confined "to that matter", which I take to mean for the period
from 16
September 1995 to 17 October 1995.  Even if it is read in that somewhat
benevolent way it still means that the figures are
wrong, a word used by Mr
Bailey in the answer I have just quoted.
<P>

179   	Mr Stevenson also sought to meet the submission that Mr
Bailey's evidence that his statements did not necessarily contain
everything
that he did was intended to convey no more than that he had not exposed, in his
statements, every step in his process
of reasoning, and not as a concession
that he had adjusted his figures otherwise than to deal with the specific
criticisms made of
him.  It seems to me that that probably is so.
<P>

180   	Mr Brereton submitted that Global's obligation was to
ensure there were sufficient operators based on call statistics and
operator
management information supplied by Legion on a regular basis, and that Legion
was bound to provide Global with call figures
monthly, and operator call
reports daily.  There was no suggestion that the failure to provide the
"monthly" figures should be excused
due to circumstances beyond Legion's
control.
<P>

181   	Mr Burden agreed that after June 1995, Legion failed to
provide Global with such figures and reports at all.  Their absence,
it was
submitted, deprived Global of the information essential to determine roster
schedules and the number of readers to be rostered
at any time and, in these
circumstances, a condition precedent to the obligation created by clause 2(m)
was not met.  The matter
was also put that any such failure was attributable to
Legion's breach of its obligations under clause 1(c).
<P>

182   	However, it was further submitted that Global did ensure
there were sufficient operators available to cover the service.
 Ms Ramzan, who
was in charge of rostering the operators, said she had no difficulty in finding
operators to fill the demand and
that a minimum of twelve and a maximum of
fifteen operators were rostered from January until April 1995.  As at July
1995, Legion
had recorded twenty named psychic readers as provided by Global to
whom identification numbers had been issued for use on the system.
 Further, Mr
Brereton submitted, certain statistics referred to as the "Shabnam statistics"
showed that for the period April 1995
to January 1996, according to Legion's
statistics, operators were logged on for a total of 354,675 minutes, but that
calls totalled
only 105,277 minutes.  Thus, during that period, there was, he
submitted, always a surplus capacity available.  Mr Burden, when faced
with
these figures, conceded that the time operators were logged on exceeded call
minutes over the period by a factor of 6.0:1.7.
 This percentage derived from
Mr Burden's concession, Tp.130, that operators were logged on for 6,077 hours,
but were busy only for
1,791 hours.  Mr Brereton submitted that even using Mr
Bailey's most recent figures in place of the Shabnam statistics, a similar
result was achieved.
<P>

183   	He continued that if operators were not "logged on"
during the period from October to December 1995 it was because calls
were not
being received by them during that period and no call statistics were provided
to Global to enable it to plan for that period.
<P>

184   	Mr Brereton made the telling submission that a number of
operators were called, who gave evidence that although they were
logged on and
ready and willing and able to take calls, calls were not made to them.
<P>

185   	Exhibit 4 was tendered with a view to seeking to prove
recorded instances when Global's operators, although logged on and
therefore
purportedly available, failed to answer calls directed to them.  However,
serious doubt was cast upon the accuracy of that
by the evidence of Mr Burden
at Tp.104.  He was cross-examined about 1 April 1995, as recorded in that
exhibit, and he said it would
seem that the computer was obviously selecting
"success" plus "clear" as well as "success" plus "no answer" plus "clear", the
former
indicating a call on which the caller had hung up before the operator
had an opportunity to answer it generally.  The evidence continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Therefore included in Exhibit DB-1, just in respect of the first day,
five out of the six calls are calls in respect of which
the caller hung up
before the operator had a chance to answer?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That would seem to be the case in those six calls.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Yes.  And to describe Exhibit DB-1 as a list of calls when an operator
failed to answer is an inaccurate description, isn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, it is.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And I think you may have already agreed with me, that save in respect of
the days for which we have the original data, it is just
not possible to tell
which of the other calls in Exhibit DB-1 are `success' plus `clear' and which
of the others are `success' plus
`no answer' plus `clear', is it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No, it is not possible to tell that."</b>
<P>

186   	Mr Brereton then noted that Mr Bailey's most recent
report showed a markedly reduced level of "calls not answered", which
needed to
be weighed against the unchallenged evidence of the operators which was
substantiated to a large degree by their logs.
 This had to be done in the
context of their evidence not being challenged and the accuracy of their logs
being corroborated by the
close correlation with Telstra's records.
<P>

187   	In my opinion Legion has not established that Global
failed to provide sufficient operators.  Notwithstanding that Legion
failed to
furnish Global with the information to which Global was contractually entitled,
none-the-less Global did provide sufficient
operators and there is no
justification to find, on the evidence, that unanswered calls were as a result
of Global operators not
being on duty.
<P>

<b>Call Failures</b>
<P>

188   	Mr Brereton submitted that there was no acceptable
evidence of "call failures", i.e. of calls made but not answered.  I have
referred to the difficulties with the evidence of Mr Bailey and to the
reduction in numbers from those alleged originally to those
upon which reliance
was ultimately placed, the latter being one of significance as the analysis was
of Legion's data and still disclosed
a real potential for error.
<P>

189   	As the evidence developed, however, it emerged, and I
accept this evidence, that a substantial proportion of these failures
was, as a
matter of probability, repeat calls generated by a few persistent callers.  Mr
Brereton submitted this was evidenced by
the Telstra Origin of Call Reports and
the documents subpoenaed from Telstra: Exhibit Q, which showed the actual
calling number,
and also from the analysis of calls prepared for Legion, with a
view to refuting the auto dialler claim, and ultimately tendered
by Global as
Exhibit S.  An analysis of these figures shows the call failures were, in a
number of instances, generated by a few
callers making from ten to, sometimes,
fifty successive attempts before being connected, although the evidence also
showed that notwithstanding
the number of attempts the caller was, generally
speaking, usually connected so that no revenue was lost.  Mr Brereton submitted
that this view was supported by the circumstance that there was no advertising
after August 1995, so that one would expect that the
level of demand to
progressively decrease; that while, as expected, the call volume decreased
according to Telstra records, there
was apparently a massive increase in
"failures"; that while very high in the days preceding the switch on 19
December 1995, when
the lines were switched to Legion the failures ceased
although there was no commensurate increase in revenue calls; and that these
matters led to the inference that despite the apparently high number of
"failures" they represented a very small demand, and, ultimately,
that was a
demand which was generally satisfied.
<P>

190   	Mr Brereton further submitted that it was never
anticipated that every call would be answered, with which Mr Burden had agreed:
Tp.127.
<P>

191   	Mr Brereton submitted that the circumstance that there
were some call failures did not establish a failure to ensure that
sufficient
operators were available to cover the service.  He then dissected the figures
in various ways, placing emphasis upon the
fact that not every unanswered call
or call failure would have led to a revenue producing situation.
<P>

192   	The relevant records from which unanswered calls and call
failures could be ascertained were those of Legion.  Legion had
every
opportunity to establish that for which it contended.  It also had obligations,
with which it failed to comply to the extent
to which I have referred, to
provide information to Global.
<P>

193   	The case was adjourned on 18 February 1999 because of the
necessity to consider the evidence of Mr Bailey and certain other
evidence
relating, inter alia, to unanswered calls and call failures.  In the result
Legion had more than ample time to put forward
its case in this regard.
<P>

194   	In his submissions in reply Mr Stevenson attacked the
analysis of Exhibit Q on which Mr Brereton relied.  He submitted that
it
established no more than that there were repeat callers, which Legion accepted.
He continued that it provided no reliable basis
upon which to calculate the
pattern of repeat callers in April 1995, the extent to which call failures in
April 1995 might be repeat
calls, nor such discount as should be made to
Legion's figures to take account of repeat callers.
<P>

195   	He continued that Exhibit S did not purport to deal in a
comprehensive way with the April origin of call records, but, rather,
was
prepared to deal with the allegations by Mr Murrell of auto dialling.  He
submitted it did not provide any basis upon which to
extent the pattern of
repeat calls during April or any other period, that it was not prepared for
that purpose and that it did not
purport to do so.
<P>

196   	The submission then went on to refer to some further
analysis, which had been carried out on the April 1995 Telstra Origin
of Call
Reports.  Even accepting for the moment the way in which the material is sought
to be used and the validity of the hypotheses,
there is no justification for
carrying forward the April 1995 figures to other months and, in fact,
irrespective of these analyses,
which in my view should have been carried out
and the subject of evidence, the fact remained that there was powerful evidence
of
repeat callers, which would explain the failed calls.  Mr Stevenson finally
submitted that the appropriate way to take into account
repeat calls, when
assessing the damage Legion had suffered as a result of Global's alleged breach
of the Agreement, was to discount
the number of missed calls for which Legion
contended, namely 19,070 by 14.49% at the most.
<P>

197   	In my opinion Legion has simply failed to prove the
number of failed and/or unanswered calls and to put into any context
that
number, in any event, in relation to the extent to which it was anticipated
that not all calls would be successful in any event.
 Therefore, it has not
proved that Global breached its agreement.
<P>

198   	For all these reasons this aspect of Legion's cross-claim
must failed.
<P>

199   	The second basis on which the cross-claim proceeded was
that clause 2(c) of the Agreement provided an undertaking by Global
and its
partners to offer Legion first option for other related services not detailed
in Schedule 1.
<P>

200   	It was submitted that Global breached this clause by
failing to offer Legion the opportunity of processing the calls it promoted
through ITM, which were the Psychic Hotline calls.  There was no challenge to
the evidence of Mr Burden that no such offer had been
made and that had it been
Legion would have accepted it.
<P>

201   	Mr Stevenson pointed to Mr Lovell's evidence of his
understanding that the Agreement imposed upon Global an obligation to
procure
that Legion have the work of processing the Psychic Hotline calls and, from all
this, he submitted that Legion was entitled
to damages in an amount equal to
that earned by ITM for processing those calls.  He continued that the documents
produced by ITM
on subpoena did not enable a precise calculation to be made of
its earnings for the period from December 1994 to June 1995, although
it was
possible to provide a precise calculation for the period July 1995 to December
1995.  Mr Stevenson submitted further that
Legion accepted that if its
submissions as to the variation of the Agreement were accepted, its claim under
clause 2(c) would only
be for the period up to the date when the variation took
effect.  As I do not accept that there was a variation that becomes
irrelevant.
<P>

202   	Mr Brereton submitted that the issue was whether "Psychic
Hotline" was Global's partner, as pleaded in clause 3A of the Amended
Cross-Claim.  "Psychic Hotline" was operated through Psychic Hotline Pty
Limited.  At Tp.141 Mr Burden agreed that as at December
1994 he knew that
Psychic Hotline Pty Limited had an existing relationship with ITM and that that
was "a business I was after". 
He said the telephone numbers were portable
"with the consent of both service providers" and that, accordingly, ITM's
consent would
be necessary.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. You knew that Psychic Hotline Pty Ltd could not take those numbers from
ITM and give them to Legion without ITM's consent?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's right.  Such consent would not normally be withheld by ITM.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Did I ask you that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No you didn't.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. At the meeting on 8 November 1994, Mr Lovell said to you and the other
Legion personnel present, `you know our current position
with ITM'.  Didn't
he?</b>
<P>

<b>A. He said words to that effect, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. He said, `while we are interested in pursuing a business relationship
with you, we do want to protect our investment in this business
so far'?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Words to that effect, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Mr Maxted said, `that's fine and we certainly understand that'?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

203   	Mr Burden said he did not know, in December 1994, that
the reason why the company contracting with Legion was Global and
not Psychic
Hotline Pty Limited was because of the latter's existing relationship with
ITM.
<P>

204   	This evidence makes it obvious to me that "Psychic
Hotline" was controlled by Psychic Hotline Pty Limited.  There was no
evidence
that Psychic Hotline Pty Limited was either a partner or assign of Global, each
being a corporate entity carrying on a similar
business.
<P>

205   	I also accept the submission of Mr Brereton that the
words "Psychic Hotline", in the Schedule, were descriptive of the services
only
and a generic statement of the type of service being offered.
<P>

206   	On the issue of damages the parties have agreed that if,
contrary to the view to which I have come, there was such a breach
Legion's
total entitlement for the period from December 1994 to December 1995 is
$62,030.95.  If, on the other hand, the obligations
of exclusivity came to an
end in April 1995, the parties are agreed the total would be $22,031.24.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

207   	In my opinion the following orders should be made:-
<P>

1.	Judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $120,764.53
to which interest will have to be added.
<P>

2.	The defendant's cross-claim be dismissed.
<P>

208   	I invite the parties to bring in Short Minutes of Order
to give effect to these conclusions at which time I shall consider
any
submission on costs and interest.
<P>

209   	I stand the matter over until Friday, 26 November 1999
for mention.
