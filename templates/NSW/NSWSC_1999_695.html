<b>1618/99 - SAXBY BRIDGE MORTGAGES PTY LIMITED  v  SAXBY BRIDGE PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by notice of motion filed on
25 June 1999.  By that application the plaintiff sought urgent
relief designed
to permit it to continue to use some twenty-four telephone numbers, and four
additional numbers with respect to facsimiles,
all of which it currently uses
in its business, at the new premises to which it proposed to move yesterday
evening or today.
<P>

2  	I was told by the plaintiff's counsel at the commencement of
yesterday's hearing that it was necessary that the application
be determined on
that day.  The defendant also encouraged me to do so.  Although I was not
entirely convinced that the matter was
so urgent, I heard the application fully
and when the hearing concluded I announced my decision as requested by the
parties, and
directed the plaintiff to bring in short minutes.  I adjourned the
case to this morning for the purpose of delivering my ex tempore
reasons for
judgment.
<P>

3  	I mention these circumstances because it seems to me that there
was a real inconsistency between the parties' eager request
for an urgent
interlocutory determination and their conduct of the case yesterday.  In the
course of a five-hour hearing fifteen
affidavits were read, ten exhibits were
tendered, a witness gave oral evidence and was cross-examined and there were
substantial
oral submissions in which I was taken to case law and a learned
text concerning legal issues which are far from straightforward.
 I did my best
to assess all of the evidence and argument but I must say that in my view
neither side had sufficiently pruned marginally
relevant material from their
cases.  In my opinion it was an unreasonable imposition on the Court to seek a
decision yesterday evening.
<P>

4  	The notice of motion sought principal relief on two alternative
bases.  The first was by way of order that the defendant immediately
take all
steps within its power to transfer the telephone numbers to the plaintiff at
its new address in Bligh Street.  The alternative,
in the event that transfer
was not for some reason technically possible, was that the defendant be ordered
after the plaintiff leaves
the O'Connell Street premises to attach to the
telephones and facsimile numbers an answering machine message re-directing the
caller
to the new telephone number of the plaintiff.   At the end of the
recorded message the caller would be automatically disconnected.
<P>

5  	In addition to those principal forms of relief the plaintiff also
sought an order that the defendant refer to the plaintiff
at its new premises
and telephone number any inquiry made by any person to the defendant with
respect to Saxby Bridge Mortgages.
<P>

6  	The circumstances in which this relief is sought are as follows.
In late 1994 or early 1995 there were discussions between Mr
Kingston, who has
been described loosely as the principal of the plaintiff, and Mr Braysich of
the defendant with respect to setting
up a new mortgage company.  In March 1995
the plaintiff commenced trading.  The plaintiff was constituted so that eighty
per cent
of its shares were held by the Kingston interest and twenty per cent
was held by the defendant.  During its initial months of trading
the plaintiff
shared the premises at Level 6, 4 O'Connell Street, Sydney, with the defendant.
During a start-up period the premises
were supplied rent-free by the defendant
and telephones were supplied.  As at the hearing yesterday the plaintiff
remained in those
premises though the arrangements with respect to telephones
changed in mid-1996.
<P>

7  	During the period from 1995 to early 1999 the plaintiff's
business prospered and expanded and the plaintiff came to employ staff,
to pay
a commercial rent and to pay for all telephone lines and advertising necessary
for its business.  The business of the plaintiff
is conducted to a considerable
degree by use of the telephone, so that the provision of telephone lines was
important to it.
<P>

8  	In mid-1996 an arrangement was made between the plaintiff and the
defendant whereby the plaintiff acquired its own dedicated
telephone numbers
for which it paid.  This arrangement was achieved by the defendant procuring
from Telstra itemised bills for telephone
rental and use directed to the
defendant, separately identifying the telephone lines dedicated to the
plaintiff and attributing part
of the common costs of the telephone service,
such as directory costs, to the plaintiff.  The practice emerged that upon
receipt
of Telstra's itemised bill directed to it, the defendant would render
an account to the plaintiff for that part of the bill payable
by the
plaintiff.
<P>

9  	The dedicated lines used by the plaintiff included the telephone
line 9202 2424, which appeared against the plaintiff's name
in telephone
directories and advertising material, as I shall note later.  It also included
the facsimile line 9202 2411 which was
also widely advertised.  Additionally,
there were other facsimile lines and a substantial number of lines allocated to
individual
staff of the plaintiff.  I shall return to the way in which those
numbers were used.
<P>

10  	On 23 February 1999 the defendant purported to cease doing
business with the plaintiff and to evict the plaintiff from the
premises in
O'Connell Street.  Mr Braysich resigned as a director of the plaintiff, saying
that he wished to avoid a conflict of
interest.  Shortly afterwards two
companies were incorporated or commenced as wholly owned subsidiaries of the
defendant, named Saxby
Bridge Mortgages and Finance Pty Limited and Saxby
Bridge Home Loans Pty Limited.
<P>

11  	These events, and some arguments about the defendant's
entitlement to trail commissions with respect to mortgage referrals
to the
plaintiff, led to the commencement of proceedings.  Proceedings 1618/99 were
instituted by the plaintiff to obtain relief
with respect to allegations which
may be colloquially referred to as allegations about the poaching of customers.
I was informed
from the bar table that there are also oppression proceedings in
the expedition list of the Equity Division, instituted by the present
defendant
against the plaintiff.  
<P>

12  	The application to me is an application in proceedings 1618/99.
In those proceedings an interlocutory application was made
to Hamilton J in
March of this year and on 22 March 1999 his Honour granted interlocutory relief
to the plaintiff upon the usual
undertaking as to damages.  That relief
included an order restraining the defendant from poaching persons specified in
the order
who have made an application for mortgage finance to the plaintiff or
to whom the plaintiff has communicated approval for finance
or to whom the
plaintiff has provided finance.  The order prevents the defendant from making
an approach to those people which would
seek their application for mortgage
finance to any entity other than the plaintiff.   Additionally, Hamilton J
ordered that the defendant
be restrained from interfering with the plaintiff's
quiet use and enjoyment of Level 6, 4 O'Connell Street until further order.
<P>

13  	In his reasons for judgment Hamilton J noted that the latter
relief was framed so that the defendant could seek to procure
the plaintiff's
ejectment from the premises if in fact the defendant ceased to occupy them
before 30 June 1999, but that has not
occurred.  The basis for the order was
that the plaintiff had tendered to the defendant twelve months rent for the
period expiring
on 30 June 1999, so effectively the order ensured the
plaintiff's quiet enjoyment until that date.  
<P>

14  	It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff is actively
engaged in moving from O'Connell Street to new premises in 25 Bligh
Street, and
that it was in the course of the planning of the arrangements for moving that
the plaintiff raised with the defendant
the question of taking the telephone
numbers associated with its business to the new premises.  The issue was raised
in a letter
by the plaintiff's solicitors to the defendant's solicitors dated
23 June 1999.  The defendant's solicitors refused the plaintiff's
request and
consequently the present motion was filed.
<P>

15  	It is trite law that the plaintiff can succeed in the present
application only if it satisfies the requirements for the grant
of
interlocutory relief and, in particular, only if it shows that there is a
serious question to be tried and that the balance of
convenience favours the
making of the orders.
<P>

16  	As to the issue whether there is a serious question to be tried,
the plaintiff says it has a better title to the telephone
lines than the
defendant and asserts a proprietary right to the telephone numbers which it
uses, in the nature of goodwill, because
of the association of the telephone
numbers with its business.  The plaintiff relies on Young J's decision in
<i>Rahme v Telstra Corporation Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20119%20FLR%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 119 FLR 426.</a>  There Young J
said (at 428):
<P>

`It may be that the subscriber does not have a proprietary right like it might
have in a book or a pencil, but it seems to me that
there is at least some
proprietary right in the nature of goodwill in the association of the telephone
number with the business.'
<P>

17  	His Honour declared (at 432) that as between the plaintiff,
which was the purchaser of a business, and the vendors of the business,
the
plaintiff had a better right and title to the telephone numbers.
<P>

18  	In the present case there is evidence that the telephone numbers
9202 2424 and 9202 2411 have been used in a manner which associates
them with
the plaintiff's business as regards the persons with whom the plaintiff deals,
and that this has taken place since mid-1996.
 The yellow and white pages
telephone directories for 1998/99 list the general telephone number against the
name of the plaintiff
and it is anticipated that the new telephone directories
for 1999/2000 will do likewise.  There is evidence that letterheads,
promotional
brochures, advertisements and business cards also give particulars
of the general telephone and facsimile numbers.
<P>

19  	Most of the other numbers which are the subject of the
application are direct lines used by staff and consultants of the plaintiff.
The evidence is that they are encouraged to give the numbers out to customers,
but it appears that the numbers are not printed on
their business cards.  Mr
Kingston estimates that of all customers' calls about 80% come through direct
lines.  There is also evidence
that a fax number which is frequently used
provides access to the plaintiff's accounts department.
<P>

20  	There is surprisingly little evidence before me as to the
contractual position of the defendant vis a vis Telstra, and of the
plaintiff
and the defendant with respect to use of the telephone lines.  Mr Braysich has
given evidence that the contract with Telstra
is for a spectrum system under
which there is a fixed obligation to take a specified number of lines over a
fixed period of time
regardless of usage.  There is also evidence, which is
contested, as to the arrangement between the parties.  It is clear that the
contract with Telstra remains with the defendant and it is also clear that the
defendant has licensed the use of specified lines
to the plaintiff.  What is
contested is the nature and terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the
defendant.  
<P>

21  	There is a basis on this evidence for arguing that the plaintiff
is entitled to relief on the ground that as against the defendant
it has a
better title to the telephone numbers.  As presented to me yesterday, the
argument was far from robust both with respect
to facts and law.  As to the
facts, the plaintiff has no direct contractual relationship with Telstra and,
moreover, the nature of
the subscriber's rights against Telstra is very unclear
in the present case because of the limited evidence of that contractual
relationship.
 In <i>Rahme's</i> case Young J noted that after 1992 Telstra
supplied services under general tariff conditions which expressly stated that
the customer
has no title, goodwill or interest in any telephone number to be
allocated to it.  I do not know whether that tariff condition still
exists and
if it does, whether it applies to the kind of telephone service which is in
dispute in this case.
<P>

22  	As to the law, in my opinion the <i>Rahme</i> decision is
distinguishable on a number of grounds.  First, it related to a telephone
service which was provided prior to the commencement
of the general tariff
conditions to which I have just referred.  Second, the decision relates to the
rights of the subscriber.  In
the present case the defendant, not the
plaintiff, is the subscriber.  Even if the defendant has proprietary rights the
plaintiff
may be a mere contractual licensee.   Third, the dispute in that case
was between the vendor and purchaser of a business in circumstances
where the
vendor had falsely asserted to Telstra that the business was theirs and that
the purchaser had not in fact bought it but
was merely their manager.  Here the
dispute is between the defendant, who at all relevant times had contractual
rights as against
Telstra, and the plaintiff whose claim to use the lines can
only be asserted through or under the defendant.  The defendant has not
dropped
out of the picture.  Fourth, the plaintiff claims proprietary rights in respect
of twenty-eight lines but it is questionable
whether any more than two of them
can be said to be associated with the plaintiff's business in the manner
described by Young J or
in any other way that generates value in the nature of
goodwill.
<P>

23  	If the <i>Rahme</i> case was intended to lay down that where a
telephone number becomes associated by customers with the user's business the
proprietor
of the business has in all cases a proprietary right in the nature
of goodwill, I would respectfully doubt that such a wide proposition
was
correct.  The true principle may be more limited.  Equity will protect the
contractual rights of the subscriber and any licensee
of the subscriber by
injunction in the usual way, provided there are relevant contractual provisions
to enforce.  Equity will also
restrain an apprehended passing off where the
ingredients of the tort and the risk of harm to the plaintiff are made out.  In
cases
of passing off it is sometimes said that the basis of equitable
intervention is protection of the goodwill of the plaintiff's business,
but
that could be misleading if taken to imply that equitable relief is available
simply to protect goodwill, regardless of whether
grounds of apprehended
tortious misconduct are established:  Meagher Gummow and Lehane, <i>Equity
Doctrines and Remedies</i>, 3rd ed, 1992, pars. 4203 and 4212.
<P>

24  	Although the plaintiff did not specifically rely on the point in
oral submissions, it may be contended that on the evidence
there was a
reasonable ground to apprehend that the defendant would engage in conduct
amounting to passing off or misleading and
deceptive conduct.  There is some
evidence to that effect constituted by the establishment of two companies with
names which are
misleadingly similar to the plaintiff's name.  There is also
evidence, all of which is contradicted, about confusion in the minds
of the
customers of the plaintiff.  That evidence may be enough to establish a serious
question to be tried, if some other kind of
relief was sought.  Hamilton J
thought it appropriate to grant relief arising out of such concerns on 22 March
1999.  But it seems
to me that apprehensions of that kind do not justify relief
of the absolute kind sought in the present application concerning the
telephone
numbers.
<P>

25  	My conclusion is that I doubt, all things considered, that the
plaintiff has established that there is a serious question to
be tried with
respect to the present application;  but I need not resolve that matter because
I am satisfied that even if there was
a serious question to be tried, the
plaintiff would fail on balance of convenience.
<P>

26  	As to balance of convenience, both the plaintiff and the
defendant are about to move their business premises.  The plaintiff
is about to
move, or possibly has already moved, to Level 30, 25 Bligh Street.  The
defendant proposes to move some of its business
operations into Level 6, 4
O'Connell Street when the plaintiff departs.  The evidence is that Level 6 will
be turned into meeting
rooms and rooms for the location of the most senior
consultants of the defendant.  Both parties need telephone lines for the
conduct
of their businesses, businesses which in both cases rely heavily on
telephone contact with customers.
<P>

27  	The plaintiff submitted that there was no evidence that the
defendant needs any additional phone lines, whereas the evidence
demonstrated
that the plaintiff clearly needs to continue the lines it currently uses.  But
the evidence shows that as from February
1999 the defendant expected the
plaintiff to return the twenty-eight phone lines to it, and can be presumed to
have made its business
plans on the basis that those lines would be available.
Installation of senior consultants on Level 6 implies that phone lines would
be
needed there to permit them to operate.
<P>

28  	The plaintiff submitted that the defendant could obtain new
telephone lines from Telstra easily as an existing subscriber.
 There is
evidence in Mr Best's affidavit that it would be `no trouble' for the defendant
to add twenty lines to its existing system.
 I am inclined to doubt that
evidence.  It appears that the information obtained from Telstra by Mr Best was
based on a misdescription
of the defendant's telephone system.  An affidavit by
Mr Braysich tends to confirm that I should be sceptical of Mr Best's evidence.
In any event, that evidence does not indicate the cost of establishing new
phone lines, the time frame for delivery or whether it
would be easy to set up
the new lines on Level 6.
<P>

29  	Having regard to the evidence I cannot reach the conclusion the
defendant would be able to satisfy its telephone requirements
for Level 6
expeditiously enough to avoid real disruption to its business plans, even
assuming that the plaintiff's undertaking as
to damages would be sufficient
protection to the defendant with respect to the costs of installing new
lines.
<P>

30  	While both the plaintiff and the defendant had business needs
with respect to the telephone lines which are in dispute, the
difference
between their respective positions is that the plaintiff has been on notice
since February 1999 that the defendant would
expect the return of the lines
when the plaintiff vacated the O'Connell Street premises.
<P>

31  	The relevant facts are these.  By letter of 23 June 1999 the
plaintiff's solicitor demanded that the telephone numbers be taken
with the
plaintiff when it moved from the O'Connell Street premises.  However, as the
defendant's solicitors pointed out in a letter
of 24 June 1999, the defendant
had given the plaintiff notice by letter of 23 February 1999 that the telephone
numbers would be withdrawn
from the plaintiff's use. At the hearing before
Hamilton J on 19 March 1999 the following occurred, according to the
transcript:
<P>

`Mr Hartnell submitted that the defendant should not be required to continue to
provide the plaintiff with a telephone service because
there was no ongoing
business relationship.  Mr Webb said he had not turned his mind to that issue.
His Honour said at the moment
he could not see any ground for an order that the
defendant should continue to pay the plaintiff's telephone service.'
<P>

32  	In his reasons for judgment on 22 March 1999, par.10, Hamilton J
noted that the plaintiff had informed the Court that it would
not regard the
cutting off of its telephone services as a breach of the injunction relating to
quiet enjoyment, whatever other rights
that act might give rise to.  
<P>

33  	Thus, the plaintiff was aware from February of this year that
the defendant had a claim with respect to the telephone numbers
used in the
plaintiff's business.  Given the plans for relocation of business activities to
which I have referred, it is appropriate
for me to infer, in the absence of any
timely contest by the plaintiff to the defendant's position, that the defendant
made its business
plans in reliance on the availability of the telephone lines
which are currently used by the plaintiff.  The question of use of the
telephone lines was raised by the plaintiff very late, after the main part of
the relocation plans of the parties must have been
well and truly made.  I do
not find that these facts constituted estoppel or acquiescence or laches in the
strict sense, but it seems
to me that in the exercise of my discretion with
respect to the balance of convenience, those facts are very significant.
<P>

34  	It is also relevant that the plaintiff has had under way
arrangements for the installation of telephone lines at the Bligh
Street
premises for some months.  The evidence indicates that a proposal was made to
the plaintiff by Siemens Communication Limited
by letter of 29 April 1999.
There is also some evidence of an application made on behalf of the plaintiff
to Telstra, the evidence
being annexed to an affidavit of Mr Perry who is a
director of the defendant.
<P>

35  	In his oral evidence Mr Kingston denied that a facsimile
signature, which appears in an annexure to the affidavit and purports
to be his
signature, was in fact affixed to the relevant telephone application form by
him.  It is not necessary for me to determine
whether Mr Kingston signed that
document.  It is enough for present purposes to note that the annexure to Mr
Perry's affidavit includes
a letter from Telstra to `Melita' with respect to
the plaintiff dated 18 May 1999.   That evidence confirms that the plaintiff's
telephone plans have been under way for some time and well before its letter of
23 June to the defendant.
<P>

36  	The final matter relevant to balance of convenience is an offer
which was made by the defendant's solicitor to the plaintiff's
solicitor in
writing on 28 June 1999.  The offer was made in an effort to limit the legal
expenses associated with having an interlocutory
argument and was made without
admissions.  It was that the defendant was willing to consent to an order
whereby the plaintiff was
given use of five telephone numbers including the
principal advertised telephone number and the principal fax number for the
period
of time which is the earlier of twelve months and the determination of
the substantive proceedings in the Supreme Court.  The offer
was rejected on
behalf of the plaintiff.  It seems to me, however, that the principal
difficulty for the plaintiff would be overcome
if the plaintiff was able to
take with it the principal advertised lines, and it is this that the offer made
available.  In the course
of argument yesterday I asked the defendant's
solicitor whether the offer would remain open and he said that it would remain
open,
available for acceptance by the defendant today.  I indicated to counsel
for the plaintiff that I was disposed to take appropriate
steps to ensure that
the offer would be available for acceptance by the plaintiff, but I was not
inclined to make an order, even
with the plaintiff's usual undertaking as to
damages, compelling the defendant to make those lines available.  My reason was
that,
given the defendant's willingness to make an agreement of the kind
outlined, it seemed to me undesirable and unnecessary for an order
of the Court
to be made.
<P>

37  	This morning the legal representatives of the parties informed
me, after some argument about what occurred yesterday, that
their clients were
prepared to make an agreement reflecting the substance of the offer in the
letter of 28 June 1999.  Their agreement
means that I can achieve the objective
which I articulated yesterday evening of ensuring, if I deny the application,
that nonetheless
the plaintiff will be able to take advantage of the offer of
28 June.  
<P>

38  	My conclusion therefore is that the plaintiff's application with
respect to telephone lines must be denied, but that the Court
should note the
agreement of the parties along the lines of the offer contained in the letter
of 28 June.  
<P>

39  	I have heard argument on the question of costs and I have
concluded that the plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs of
the
application.  The parties have now handed up short minutes of orders which I
have amended after discussion with the parties.
 The plaintiff accepts that the
short minutes reflect the orders which I outlined yesterday evening and the
reasons for judgment
which I have just delivered.  I initial and date the short
minutes for the purposes of identification.  I note the matter in par.1
and I
make the orders in pars. 2, 3 and 4.
