<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner has pleaded guilty before me to one
offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.97(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, a subsequent offence under

<P>

2  	It will be necessary in this case of multiple offences to have
regard to the totality principle and also the principles referred
to by the
High Court in <b>The Queen v. Pearce</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20156%20ALR%20684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 156 ALR 684.</a>
<P>

3  	The facts of these offences are as follows:-
<P>

<b>Assault with intent to rob being armed with an offensive instrument at
Blacktown on 4 August 1997</b>
<P>

"At about midday on Monday 4 August 1997, the prisoner went to the Blacktown
East Totalizer Agency Board (the "TAB") with an unknown
male person, where she
had a brief conversation with the 26 year old TAB manager Neil Flockhart.  The
male accomplice of the prisoner
was seen to flick through results books whilst
the prisoner looked around at security cameras.  The prisoner and the male
accomplice
were in the TAB for about five minutes.
<P>

A regular patron of the TAB who was there at the time took particular notice of
the prisoner.  The patron was still in the TAB with
about eight other adult
male customers when two bandits entered the TAB about 4.15 pm the same day, one
being an unknown male, the
other being the prisoner.
<P>

Both of the bandits wore dark coloured full face balaclavas, gloves, padded
clothing on the top half of their bodies, track pants
and shoes.  The male
offender carried what resembled a hand gun.  He threatened customers in the TAB
with the gun upon entry to the
TAB, demanding that they lie on the floor.  The
prisoner said 'get down, get down on the floor'.
<P>

The TAB manager was working alone at the time, but was behind an enclosed,
secure area which accessed the back of the premises.
 He saw the offenders.
Fearing that he was about to be held up, he made good his exit into the back
room.  He was able to activate
hold up alarms.
<P>

The prisoner and her accomplice banged on the outside of the enclosed area.
Her accomplice was heard to say words to the effect
of 'I need the money'.  The
prisoner was heard to say 'come on let's get out'.  They were unable to obtain
money or other property.
 There was cash on the premises at the time.
<P>

As the prisoner and her accomplice were leaving the TAB, her accomplice said
words to the effect of 'We ought to pop one of these
cunts off', referring to
the customers who were lying on the floor of the TAB.  The prisoner said words
to the effect of 'No fuck
that, fuck that, let's go'.  They then ran off, but
were photographed by TAB security cameras.
<P>

It is unclear how the prisoner and her accomplice travelled to and from the
TAB.  A subsequent search of premises at Lethbridge
Park which had been
occupied by the prisoner led to the seizure of footwear and clothing, some of
which appears to be the same as
items worn during the TAB robbery.
<P>

Enquiries led to the prisoner being identified from photographs as the female
who was in the TAB earlier in the day prior to the
robbery.  It has not been
established who the male accomplice was.
<P>

The prisoner was electronically interviewed at Blacktown Police Station on 30
December 1998.  During the interview, the prisoner
admitted that she went to
the TAB wearing a balaclava with an intent to rob, but she denied being armed
herself.  She stated that
her role in the robbery was to keep watch if anyone
came into the TAB.  She was otherwise non-specific about details of the
incident
and did not name her accomplice, allegedly due to fears for her
safety."
<P>

<b>Assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon;  use
offensive weapon to prevent apprehension at Lurnea on 26 October
1997</b>
<P>

"At about 5.30 pm on Sunday 26 October 1997, the prisoner Mandie Jancek and a
co-offender Frank Petrinovic drove to the vicinity
of the Liquorland Bottle
Shop, located at the corner of Hill Road and Reilly Street, Lurnea.  Both
Petrinovic and Jancek travelled
there in vehicle MOW-739, a 1983 Holden
Commodore sedan owned by Petrinovic.
<P>

Petrinovic got out of the vehicle in Reilly Street.  He put on a black
balaclava and surgical gloves and armed himself with a loaded
.32 calibre
Argentina brand revolver.  At the time he was also carrying a red plastic Grace
Bros. shopping bag.  The prisoner remained
in the vehicle in Reilly Street.
<P>

Petrinovic walked into the Liquorland Bottle Shop through the Reilly Street
entrance.  He walked towards the cash register and confronted
the two employees
on duty, Ian Hagarty and Troy Stephens.
<P>

Petrinovic ordered the two employees to the ground.  Both complied.  Petrinovic
stood over both employees and pointed the loaded
revolver in their direction.
Petrinovic threw the Grace Bros. bag he was carrying behind the counter and
said 'fill up the bag'.
 Mr. Hagarty stood up and said 'Alright mate, I'll do
it'.
<P>

At that point a struggle started between Petrinovic and Mr. Hagarty.  During
the struggle, two shots were discharged from the revolver
by Petrinovic.
<P>

Mr. Hagarty continued to struggle with Petrinovic after the shots were fired,
eventually taking the revolver off Petrinovic and
staggering away.
<P>

Around this time, a number of the customers in the shop came to the aid of Mr.
Hagarty.  Petrinovic was restrained by the customers
in the driveway area.
<P>

At that point the prisoner entered the shop on foot and attempted to pull away
the customers who were restraining Petrinovic.  She
was unsuccessful and she
left the shop.  The prisoner then returned a short time later driving vehicle
MOW-739.  She drove the vehicle
into the bottle shop via the exit into Reilly
Street, and drove at Petrinovic and the customers, narrowly missing a number of
people.
<P>

This resulted in Petrinovic breaking free of the customers for a short time.
Petrinovic attempted to get into the vehicle driven
by the prisoner, but was
unable to do so.  Petrinovic then picked up a house brick and threatened the
witnesses who were trying to
detain him.
<P>

The prisoner remained in the vehicle whilst all of this was happening.  A
witness removed the keys from the ignition of the vehicle,
preventing the
prisoner from driving away.  The prisoner's vehicle was surrounded by a number
of witnesses, preventing her from escaping.
<P>

Petrinovic ran out onto the footpath of Reilly Street where he was again
restrained by customers until police arrived.  The prisoner
was taken into
custody by police, together with the co-offender Petrinovic.
<P>

Located at the scene was the loaded revolver used by Petrinovic, the balaclava
worn by Petrinovic which was removed by one of the
witnesses who tried to
detain him, surgical gloves worn by Petrinovic, and the Grace Bros. shopping
bag.
<P>

A search was made of the vehicle which the prisoner was driving.  Located in
the vehicle was a radio scanner which was set on the
police channel for the
Liverpool area, and a box of surgical gloves.
<P>

The prisoner was taken by police to Liverpool Police Station where she was
interviewed.  The prisoner stated that she did not wish
to comment about what
had occurred."
<P>

4  	Although on the plea there were tendered numerous statements,
that recital of the facts was unchallenged.  It is notable that
the statement
"we ought to pop one of these cunts off" by the prisoner's accomplice on 4
August 1997 presaged the death of Mr. Hagarty
on 26 October 1997.  It must be
remembered that the present prisoner is not charged with any complicity in the
murder or death of
Mr. Hagarty.
<P>

5  	I have had the benefit of substantial documentary material and
extensive written submissions from both the prisoner and the
Crown.  By consent
I was to have regard to that written material as provided on behalf of the
prisoner in that form.  There was no
challenge by the Crown to its content.
<P>

6  	The prisoner was arrested on 26 October 1997 and although
released for a time on bail, has been in custody for this offence
for a period
of almost one year.  Since there has been a broken period of custody, the
appropriate course will be to give the prisoner
the credit for that time as
affecting both the minimum and additional term components of the total sentence
and I will do so.
<P>

7  	The prisoner was born on 11 September 1973 and her prior criminal
record commences with the imposition of a recognizance for
assault on 5
November 1990.  On 1 October 1993 she received a recognizance for stealing and
was ordered to perform 150 hours community
service and to pay compensation in
respect of an offence of break, enter and steal.  In 1994 she was found to be
in breach of a community
service order and was the subject of a further
community service order.  She has been fined for entering enclosed land and
possessing
prohibited drugs.  She has not previously received a gaol
sentence.
<P>

8  	Although her co-offender on 4 August 1997 has not been
affirmatively identified and she did not admit it to be Frank Petrinovic,
her
co-accused in respect of the attempted robbery at Lurnea on 26 October 1997,
when interviewed, she did assert that she was not
identifying the person in
question in that interview because of fears of that person's violent nature and
for her own safety.  Considering
the violence that person showed and
threatened, and that this prisoner attempted to dissuade her accomplice from
the further act
he suggested, I can see a real basis for her fears and I
consider that her reticence should not be held against her. 
<P>

9  	Although some of the evidence suggests she was the more talkative
of the two on 4 August, nonetheless, it does not appear that
I could be
satisfied that she had the replica firearm charged.  That she successfully
dissuaded her associate from carrying out any
further violence to the persons
present is a matter which should be held to her credit.
<P>

10  	The Crown has put forward her culpability as being involved on
two occasions in joint criminal enterprises to rob and in attempting
to rescue
her associate when the robbery went wrong.  Although jointly responsible with
her co-offender(s) for the crimes, I accept
her role as less culpable.
<P>

11  	She had originally been charged with more serious offences in
relation to the events of 26 October 1997 but shortly before
trial a plea was
offered and accepted by the Crown to the offences of which she has presently
been indicted.
<P>

12  	She is entitled to some benefit under s.439 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>
because of the pleas and her co-operation, particularly in relation to the
offence of 4 August 1997, to which she confessed.  Although
one at least of the
victims of that offence was easily able to identify her, without that
confession she may have had some argument
such that the Crown case against her
on that offence was not as strong as it was against her on the other.  But, as
to the events
of 26 October 1997, she was apprehended at the scene.  The
offences had been committed in the presence of many witnesses.  The case
against her was overwhelming.
<P>

13  	She is also entitled to some more substantial benefit for the
pragmatic value of her pleas avoiding lengthy and costly proceedings
and in all
the circumstances, entered, if not at the first available opportunity, at a
time such as to avoid the costs to the community
and early enough to support
its use as indicating contrition.  Indeed, as was submitted on her behalf, the
fact of her pleading guilty
may go some way to acknowledging the harm caused in
these offences to the victims.
<P>

14  	I have been provided with the Judicial Commission Sentencing
Statistics for offences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.97(2)</a> and s.<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s33b.html" class="autolink_findacts">33B</a>.  Whilst I have had regard to
those statistics, I have also had regard to the guideline judgment of this
court in <b>Regina v. Henry &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/111.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 111</a>, not only in
relation to the appropriate ranges of sentence for offences of armed robbery
and attempted armed robbery, but also with
respect to the issue of the
relevance of drug addiction for the reasons to which I shall refer later.
<P>

15  	The prisoner did not give evidence on her plea but without
objection I was provided with a two page statement from her.  In
that statement
she refers to her two small children aged 10 and three respectively;  her
addiction and her lack of a similar record
in the past.  She asserts that she
has undergone a tremendous change whilst at the Mulawa Detention Centre and
expresses deep remorse
at the harm she has caused to others.  She informed me
that she had chosen not to go on the methadone programme and had, whilst in
gaol, been selected to work in telemarketing, having obtained a certificate in
that regard.
<P>

16  	The prospect of her rehabilitation is attested to by a school
friend, Catherine Trent, who had visited the prisoner in gaol
and noted her
health improvement.  A reference was provided by the general manager of Call
Centre Services Pty. Limited as to her
commitment, ability, effort and her
bright and cheerful personality.  The welfare officer at Mulawa has provided a
statement that
she has assisted the prisoner attend to the placement of her two
children with family members and arranged through the Department
of Housing to
ensure that the prisoner may be re-housed at the completion of her sentence.
<P>

17  	Reports from the Department of Corrective Services show that she
has enrolled as a full-time student in a range of courses
including painting
and decorating trade course, information technology, desktop publishing and
adult further education at TAFE but
has not yet managed to develop a consistent
approach to study or a level of development which would define her as an adult
learner.
 A further report indicates that her behaviour within the system is
acceptable, it having shown a marked change from the initial
problems she had
adjusting to the environment.  I am informed that she seems to have made an
effort to address her alcohol and other
drug problems, childhood, family and
related social and psychological issues, although in the circumstances with
which I was provided
with those reports by that Department, very little detail
has been given.  She has attained her TAFE qualification by way of Outreach
Access certificate and other course completion certificates.
<P>

18  	Major Hindle of the Salvation Army had assessed the prisoner for
bail purposes and found her to be highly motivated to break
her life on drugs.
Her motivation had been watched and assessed over a period of two months whilst
in Mulawa.  He confirmed her family
support.  He offered the Salvation Army
Bridge Programme to assist with rehabilitation.  That programme deals with all
aspects of
rehabilitation and is a residential programme conducted through the
William Booth Institute.
<P>

19  	In consequence of that assessment, the prisoner was bailed to
that programme but developed withdrawal and psychological reactions
to a 30
milligram daily dose of methadone and left the programme on 6 February to
reside in full-time Salvation Army care under medical
supervision, returning to
custody on 2 March 1999.  She had previously attempted residential
anti-addiction programmes with the Salvation
Army at Selah Farm and with WHO's
at the New Beginnings Therapeutic Community.
<P>

20  	A report from Dr. Lucas was provided.  He elicited a most useful
history.  
<P>

21  	The prisoner had been born to Aboriginal parents but fostered
from the age of six weeks.  Unfortunately the marriage of the
foster parents
also failed.  She had other placements but when pregnant at 15, left foster
care.  Her education was only to Year
Nine level.  She has the two children to
whom she referred in her statement.  Her relationship with her co-offender was
referred
to as relatively brief.  She has tested positive to Hepatitis C but,
otherwise than having been a heroin addict whose use of the
drug is reported as
recently increased prior to her entering custody, especially after her
association with her co-offender, she
apparently has no significant medical or
psychiatric problems.
<P>

22  	She had confirmed to Dr. Lucas that the offence which resulted
in the death of Mr. Hagarty had occurred when she and her co-accused
were
experiencing the effect of lack of heroin, having no money with which to get
it.  Her role in the expected robbery apparently
was as driver of the vehicle
and lookout.  When things went wrong and her associate was being forcibly
attacked by the people at
the bottle shop, they were also yelling at her and,
she told the doctor:-
<P>

"Without even thinking she got into the car wondering what to do and how to get
heroin.  She drove the car to where people holding
her companion (sic) and
dragged him into the car.  Someone threw a brick through a car window and a
woman took the car keys."
<P>

23  	She confirmed that the previous hold up at the TAB was an
attempt to get money to remedy a lack of heroin.  She told Dr. Lucas
she was
ashamed and felt sick in her stomach talking about the offence and believed she
had done something really wrong:-
<P>

"She thought it was time to pay back for the wrong so she could get out and
start with a clean slate.  She would make sure she would
not do anything like
this again."
<P>

24  	She had also said to Dr. Lucas that the longest she had been off
heroin had been seven months but that she had managed periods
of abstinence on
methadone.  Dr. Lucas expressed the view that her educational level did not
represent a true measure of her abilities.
 The impression he gained was that
she was of good intelligence and could well pursue further education and
training.  She told Dr.
Lucas that she did not feel emotionally mature and that
she had sustained considerable physical abuse from her male partners.
<P>

25  	Dr. Lucas refers to the interaction of her heroin dependence and
her involvement with Mr. Petrinovic in the light of her emotionally
deprived
upbringing and personal difficulties.  He has expressed the view that he was in
no doubt that she was ashamed and contrite
and accepting of the fact that she
would be punished.  He expressed the view that she was forward looking, willing
to better herself
and strongly attached to her children.  He believed that with
support, supervision and abstinence from drugs she could do well and
benefit
from education and training.  He was of the view that a substantial period of
supervision on release combined with appropriate
drug counselling would be
necessary.
<P>

26  	She has participated in drug counselling programmes whilst in
custody and although she is anxious about her children, has apparently
acted
appropriately in the view of Dr. Sefton, the Director Womens' Corrections
Health Service.  There have apparently been no incidents
relating to illicit
drug use.
<P>

27  	Dr. Lisa Brown, consultant psychiatrist at the Mulawa
Correctional Centre also provided a report which was to the same effect
as that
of Dr. Sefton in noting the prisoner's anxiety and concern for her family.  Dr.
Brown noted expressions of remorse and the
attendance at psychological and drug
and alcohol counselling.  
<P>

28  	Subsequently, additional material was provided to me by consent
in written form.  That material included numerous Mulawa Correctional
Centre
reports by various officers including classification, vocational, welfare and
other reports.  There was in addition a psychologist's
report and a letter from
her former partner dealing with the disruptive effects of her custody on her
children.  The material establishes
that although the prisoner's case suits the
profile of the mother's and children's Programme, she is not eligible for the
options
which would permit more contact with her children whilst she is in
custody until sentenced and her present status is producing a
negative effect
on her children such that by reason of her deep concern for them, is affecting
her.  The material is confirmatory
of what she put in her letter to which I
have referred and of her recent history in custody as given to the psychologist
and the
psychiatrist.  She is plainly deeply concerned for her relationship
with her children and to be reunited with them.  She is currently,
apparently,
off both heroin and methadone and has shown an ability to stay off for an
extended period.  She is actively pursuing
obtaining vocational qualifications
and is engaged in a degree of employment.  It is said that she has some insight
into her prior
relationships and that a combination of all these factors are
such as to indicate some positive prospects that she might be able
to deal with
her addiction and the personality the psychologist describes as dependent.
<P>

29  	To some considerable extent the views of the psychologist and
psychiatrist appear borne out by the primary material by way
of report from the
various Corrective Services officers.  The history given to the psychiatrist
and the psychologist is similar.
 The deprived and disrupted childhood, her
foster placements and her difficulties with foster parents appear to underlie
the predilection
to addiction 
<P>

30  	The effect of the professional assessments of the medical
practitioners is that there is a basis for a real prospect of rehabilitation
if
the prisoner is able, with support to deal with her drug addiction and no doubt
that involves her avoidance of such associates
as might also have access to
that drug.  It is clear that upon release from the custodial portion of her
sentence the prisoner will
require substantial support and supervision.  Her
position is complicated by the apparent lack of supportive immediate family.
The
evidence before me does not disclose that the prisoner is likely to resume
the relationship which had been of some duration with
the partner with whom she
lived prior to meeting Mr. Petrinovic.  In the circumstances, perhaps it is
unlikely that that relationship
will be resumed.
<P>

31  	The prisoner's lack of prior record and the fact that these
offences were committed during the time of her association with
Mr. Petrinovic
(even though the evidence does not allow me to hold that Mr. Petrinovic was her
associate in the TAB robbery) leads
me to the conclusion that, notwithstanding
her lengthy involvement with heroin, Mr. Petrinovic was a substantial influence
in the
relationship and had a substantial effect in causing this prisoner to
act in a way out of accord with her prior behaviour.  In this
regard the views
of the psychologist that she has a dependent personality and Dr. Lucas'
observations are most relevant.
<P>

32  	I would not, however, regard her criminality in the context of
her heroin addiction as completely aberrant.  The consequences
of heroin
addiction and the likelihood of embarking on serious crime in order to feed it
are all too well known to everyone in the
community, including those so
affected, even if their habit prevents them having the usual moral restraints
from involvement in serious
crime.  I am also satisfied that the prisoner is
motivated and has been trying to address the very problem of her addiction
which
has led her into this substantial criminality and divorced her from her
children.
<P>

33  	The offences are now two years old and during that time, which
for her has been apparently attended by some degree of anxiety
in relation to
the children, she has, by her behaviour, given an indication that she has the
potential to avoid the drug addict's
usual life of criminality.  It appears to
be accepted that the delays in the disposition of the matter are not her
fault.
<P>

34  	In my view she falls within that class described by Spigelman,
CJ. in <b>Henry &amp; Ors</b> (supra):-
<P>

"It may be inferred in many cases (and the present case is very much in point)
that the offender would almost certainly never have
become a thief but for loss
of control of an ordered life through drug addiction.  The propositions the
results of drug addiction
are self-inflicted is half true and therefore
dangerous.  The offender must, of course, be held responsible for his or her
own actions.
 The drug addiction is not an excuse;  but it is a factor that may
tell the court that the real weakness of character is that of
a drug addict
rather than that of a robber.  That may be by no means inconsequential.  It is,
however, a two edged factor;  it may
also tell the court that rehabilitation is
going to be difficult."
<P>

35  	The circumstances of this prisoner can be considered in the
light of her drug addiction according to the principles laid down
by Wood, CJ.
at CL. in <b>Henry</b> (supra) as including an apparently impulsive offence
with limited planning;  an impairment of judgment under the influence of the
drugs, a condition that would render rehabilitation more difficult but which in
this case professional opinion considers the offender
will try to achieve and
that the addiction was attributable at least to a substantial extent to
circumstances for which the prisoner
was not primarily responsible.  Although
the Crown submitted that in respect of the first offence, that of 4 August
1997, the prisoner
would fall within the guideline promulgated in <b>Henry
&amp; Ors</b> (supra), it also submitted that the second offence took the
matter outside the guidelines and required a more severe penalty be imposed
for
that offence.  I do not consider that the circumstance that I am dealing with
two offences disqualifies these observations from
applying here.
<P>

36  	Her prior circumstances clearly enough raise the very matters
that his Honour also considered in <b>Regina v. Fernando</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2076%20A%20Crim%20R%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 76 A. Crim.
R. 58</a> at 62 to 63 albeit in the context of heroin rather than alcohol.
<P>

37  	The prisoner's attachment for and regard to her children,
insofar as hardship is occasioned to them by reason of the absence
from their
mother, is not a matter which would normally mitigate sentence (see <b>Regina
v. Day</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20100%20A%20Crim%20R%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 100 A. Crim. R. 275).</a>  However, it is also clear that because
of her separation from the children in the circumstances the prisoner will
serve the time
she spends in custody away from them in circumstances more
onerous than others.  Although she may be able to resume that contact
in
custody, nonetheless the impact upon her of that separation is a matter that
has to be considered.
<P>

38  	Further, it is important from a point of view of rehabilitation
to have regard to the closeness of her association and concern
for her children
particularly since it appears to be a factor which strongly points towards a
willingness on her behalf to avoid
the drugs and other criminality if given
sufficient support, that is, her relationship with her children can operate
under supervision
as a support mechanism.  I was asked to recommend to the
Department of Corrective Services that she be considered for any appropriate
programme that would, in the Department's view, be available to support her
contact with and care of the children.  Plainly in her
case if such a course is
considered to meet the various exigencies including the views of the childrens'
present carers, it would
be appropriate for the Department to put it into
effect in her interests and, insofar as it assists with rehabilitation, the
community's
also.
<P>

39  	My attention was drawn also to the fact that in her attempts to
achieve rehabilitation, she had spent in residential programmes
a period of
some six months and 18 days.  I do not feel that there should be any
mathematical application of the time thus spent
to the period of sentence that
I must otherwise pass.  However, I am prepared to take into account,
particularly as showing her willingness
to attempt to achieve rehabilitation,
the time she has spent in residential programmes.
<P>

40  	The Crown submitted that whilst an appropriate sentence had to
be fixed for each offence and then the question of cumulation
or concurrence
considered (see <b>Pearce v. The Queen</b> (supra)) nonetheless it accepted
that it was open to me ultimately to impose concurrent sentences.  I am not
aware that the Crown
was in any way contending that the sentences in this case
should be other than concurrent.  I am of the view that in this case, bearing
in mind the underlying common factors, despite the fact that the offences were
some months apart, it would be appropriate that the
armed robbery offences as
well as the offence of using the vehicle with intent to avoid apprehension be
the subject of concurrent
sentences.
<P>

41  	It is submitted that this prisoner is "at the crossroads".  Such
a submission is often made and in the case of heroin addicts
committing serious
crimes of violence, is one which the courts must understandably treat with very
great caution.  It would only
be where experienced professional assistance has
been provided to a court and that assistance itself expresses what appears to
be
a firm basis for the prospect of rehabilitation that such a submission might
find favour.  In this case I have that experienced professional
assistance
apparently firmly based upon the efforts the prisoner has made and the reports
available in respect of those efforts within
the gaol system.  I have reached
the view that in this case it would be appropriate in passing sentence to put
substantial emphasis
on the prospects of rehabilitation of this prisoner in the
light of the material to which I have already referred.
<P>

42  	Nonetheless, the crimes were of considerable seriousness and
although she should not be sentenced on the basis that she caused
or was liable
for the death of Mr. Hagarty, that matter cannot be put aside entirely.  Armed
robberies have the potential to kill.
 They do cause terror.  Those who
participate in them, even in a lesser role, must realise that the courts are
required to pass sentences
which are not disproportionate to the gravity of the
crime.  In this case I accept that as part of the sentencing complex,
proportionality
requirements may be met by reducing a sentence from what it
might otherwise have been by reason of the mitigatory factors I have
referred
to above and more importantly the prospects of achieving, by the rehabilitation
of this prisoner, the avoidance of further
crime.
<P>

43  	There seems to be a real basis to believe, in this prisoner's
case, that it will be in the best interests of society if she
is permitted to
be at liberty with her children under supervision for an extensive period of
time.  I take into account both on the
minimum term and on the additional term
the time in custody pending sentence and the periods in residential
rehabilitation to which
I have referred.  She has either been in custody or in
restrictive rehabilitation schemes for the greater part of the past two years
comprising a period in actual custody of almost 12 months and a period in
residential programmes.
<P>

44  	There are plainly here special circumstances under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5(2)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> including the need for supervision during an extended period
arising from her addiction, her comparatively young age, her children,
her
attempts at rehabilitation and obtaining education and employment.  In the
light of her dependent personality and earlier deprived
circumstances, such a
longer period of supervision would appear highly desirable.  
<P>

45  	Mandie Tanya Jancek, on the first charge, you are sentenced to
penal servitude for four years.  On the second charge, you are
sentenced to
penal servitude for six years.  On the third charge, you are sentenced to penal
servitude by way of a fixed term for
two years.  That fixed term is imposed
having regard to the other sentences I am imposing, in respect of each of which
I impose a
minimum term of two years.  I impose in respect of the first charge
an additional term of two years;  in respect of the second charge
an additional
term of four years.
<P>

46  	Mandie Tanya Jancek the effect of those sentences is that you
are sentenced to penal servitude for a total of six years. The
sentences are to
be served concurrently and are comprised as follows.  There will be a minimum
term of two years commencing today,
23 November 1999 which will expire on 22
November 2001 and an additional term thereafter of four years which, having
commenced on
23 November 2001 will expire 22 November 2005.  The earliest date
upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 22 November
2001.
