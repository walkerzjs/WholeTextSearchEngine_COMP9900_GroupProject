(Cth).
<P>

The plaintiffs, members of an accountancy firm, took out professional indemnity
insurance with the defendants for the insurance
years 1 July 1993 - 30 June
1994 and 1 July 1994 - 30 June 1995.  The insurance was on a claims made and
notified basis and included
cover for claims arising out of circumstances of
which the plaintiffs became aware during the period of insurance and notified
the
defendants within that period.
<P>

In February 1994 the plaintiffs became aware of circumstances but, after taking
legal advice, elected not to notify the defendants.
 A claim was subsequently
made in September 1995 and the plaintiffs then claimed in respect of the
1993-1994 insurance year.  They
asserted that the failure to notify was an
omission within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.54(1)</a> and (6) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act
1984</a> (Cth) which did not allow the defendants to refuse to pay.  The defendants
declined liability in December 1995.
<P>

In the proceedings by the claimants against the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs
cross-claimed against their solicitors and verified the
cross-claim, which
alleged they were not insured.  The affidavit deposed that all matters of fact
were true.  Those proceedings were
settled.
<P>

In these proceedings the plaintiffs sued the defendants to recover indemnity.
The amount was agreed and there was no  issue that
the defendants were not
prejudiced.  The basic issue was whether the failure to notify was an
omission.

LIMITED &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	From 1990 to 1996 the plaintiffs, for whom Mr M.L.D.
Einfeld of Queen's Counsel and Mr D.J. Hammerschlag of Counsel appeared,
were
partners in a chartered accountancy firm, which carried on practice as Einfeld
Symonds - BDV.  Relevantly for present purposes,
they entered into an
accountants' professional indemnity insurance contract for the period 1 July
1993 to 30 June 1994 with the defendants,
for which Mr J.E. Marshall of Counsel
and Mr G.R. Kennett of Counsel appeared, whereby:
<P>

<b>"On the terms and conditions herein contained the Insurers shall indemnify
the Assured up to an amount not exceeding the Sum Insured
and Related Costs
against all loss to the Assured (including  claimants' costs) whensoever
occurring arising from any claim or claims
first made against the Assured
during the Period of Insurance and reported to the Insurers during such period,
in respect of any
description of civil liability whatsoever incurred in
connection with the Practice other than loss arising out of any circumstance
or
occurrence with (sic) has been notified under any other insurance attaching
prior to the inception of this Certificate of Insurance,
or of which the
Assured was aware at the commencement of the Period of Insurance."</b>
<P>

Thus, the primary cover was in respect of claims made during the period of
insurance, irrespective of when the acts or omissions
giving rise to them
occurred, and excepting claims made in consequence of circumstances which may
give rise to a claim of which notice
had been given under any prior insurance
or claims of which the plaintiffs were aware at the commencement of the period
of insurance.
<P>

2   	The provisos to that clause are not presently relevant and,
under the heading "General Conditions", clause 4(b) provided:-
<P>

<b>"The Assured shall give notice in writing to the Insurers as soon as
practicable of any claim the subject of the Insuring Clauses
hereof made during
the Period of Insurance (or within 14 days following the Period of Insurance
provided subsequent renewal or replacement
insurance continues with the
Insurers) against the Assured or of the receipt of notice from any person of
any intention to make a
claim against the Assured.  The Assured may also give
notice in writing to the Insurers of any circumstances of which the Assured
is
or shall become aware during the Period of Insurance which may give rise to
such a claim.  If notice is given to the Insurers
under this paragraph any
claim subsequently made (whether before or after the expiration of the Period
of Insurance) pursuant to
such an intention to claim or arising from
circumstances so notified shall be deemed to have been made at the date when
such notice
was given.  Upon request, the Assured shall give to the Insurers
all such information and assistance as the Insurers may reasonably
require."</b>
<P>

3   	The policy, accordingly, was a "claims made and notified"
one, the defendants insuring the plaintiffs against claims first
made upon them
and reported during the period of insurance and, by dint of clause 4(b),
"deemed claims", such claims being deemed
by reason of the plaintiffs' becoming
aware during the period of insurance of any circumstances, which may give rise
to a claim by
a claimant upon them, of which circumstances the plaintiffs gave
notice to the defendants during the period prescribed, and which
circumstances
were subsequently the basis of a claim upon the plaintiffs.  This is an
important provision for both the insurer and
the insured, because upon renewal
of the policy it will generally be necessary to disclose an awareness of
circumstances unless notice
thereof had been given, as it was in this case,
such that the insurer may refuse to cover the insured in the next year in
respect
of a claim arising out of those circumstances.  From the insured's
point of view, unless cover can be obtained in respect of a claim
arising out
of circumstances of which it becomes aware under the current policy, it may not
be able to do so when effecting subsequent
insurance.
<P>

4   	Exhibit A is a Statement of Agreed Facts.  For present
purposes it is unnecessary to state them all.  From about 1980 to February
1994
the plaintiffs, and their predecessors, were retained by a real estate agency
to audit its trust accounts each year as required
by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psabaa1941385/" class="autolink_findacts">Property, Stock and
Business Agents Act 1941</a>.  They completed the audit for the 1992/1993 financial
year on or about 30 September 1993 and, on 4 February 1994, one of the partners
received a telephone call from a principal of the real estate agent advising
that receivers had been appointed to it; that its affairs
were being
investigated; that there was a deficiency, presumably in the trust account;
that he thought the plaintiffs should know;
that he had given a statement to
the Real Estate Services Council accepting full responsibility for the deficit
of $300,000; and
that the shortfall was about $350,000.
<P>

5   	Some further enquiries were made and, on 7 February 1994,
the plaintiffs met. It was suggested that the defendants should be
notified,
and  consideration was given to the possible increase in future premiums if
that was done.  The policy was perused and
the plaintiffs took legal advice and
did not give notice to the defendants of the circumstances of which they had
become aware. 
The proper inference is that this was an informed choice or
election by the plaintiffs made with the benefit of legal advice.  There
was no
submission that was not the proper inference and they did not submit that the
circumstances were not such as "may give rise
to such a claim".
<P>

6   	On 20 September 1995, the plaintiffs were served with a
Statement of Claim in which The Office of Real Estate Services, as
plaintiff,
sued them for negligently carrying out the audit of the real estate agent by
reason of which the plaintiff alleged it
had suffered damage, presumably
because of the necessity to make good the deficiency.   Thereafter, the
plaintiffs gave notice to
the defendants of the claim for the first time and,
accordingly, after the relevant period of insurance, and indeed the following
period of insurance, had expired.
<P>

7   	On about 22 December 1995, the defendants advised the
plaintiffs that they were denying indemnity under the 1993-1994 and 1994-1995
policies conformably with a letter of advice received from their solicitors,
which stated:-
<P>

<b>"Our clients did not learn of these events or the Office of Real Estate
Services' claim until Minet Professional Services received
the Insured's letter
dated 27 September 1995, the next day.  Our clients therefore have no
obligation to indemnify the Insured under
either Certificate 20749/93 which
expired on 30 June 1994 or Certificate 21522/94 which expired on 30 June
1995.</b>
<P>

<b>Furthermore, our clients' view is that before 1 July 1995:</b>
<P>

<b>&#183;	the Insured knew that these events and each of these events were
relevant to our clients' decision whether to accept the risk
and, if so, on
what terms; or</b>
<P>

<b>&#183;	a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know
that these events and each of these events was relevant
to our clients'
decision whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms.</b>
<P>

<b>Our clients have instructed us that had the Insured notified them of these
events or any of these events before 1 July 1995, they
would have excluded from
their policy commencing on 1 July 1995 (Certificate number 20753/95) all claims
arising from these events
or any of them."</b>
<P>

The present claim was brought only under the policy in force from 1 July 1993
to 30 June 1994.
<P>

8   	I assume that the proposal for the 1994-1995 year required,
as did the proposal for the 1993-1994 year, (Exhibit 2), that the
plaintiffs
disclose their awareness of any circumstance which may give rise to a claim,
(Question 9), in answer to which the plaintiffs
failed to give notice of the
presently relevant circumstances.
<P>

9   	The plaintiffs cross-claimed against their former
solicitors alleging, put shortly, that in the light of their advice they
had
not given notice to the defendants and, in paragraph 31, it was pleaded:-
<P>

<b>"In consequence of the failure of Einfeld Symonds to give written notice to
the insurers within the terms of and during the currency
of the policy, which
was in force when the advice and the further advice was given, of the
Circumstances and/or the statement and/or
the letter, Einfeld Symonds are not
covered in respect of the claims made against Einfeld Symonds in the Statement
of Claim in these
proceedings and have suffered damage."</b>
<P>

10   	The Cross-Claim was verified by the first plaintiff,
paragraph 2 of the affidavit stating:-
<P>

<b>"I believe the allegations of fact in the Cross-Claim as set out above are
true."</b>
<P>

11   	On 9 December 1996, the plaintiffs settled the claim
brought against them by agreeing to pay $400,000 and, on 25 March 1997,
they
settled the Cross-Claim against their former solicitors on terms whereby they
were paid $250,000 inclusive of costs.
<P>

12   	Exhibit B records the following concession by the
defendants:-
<P>

<b>"If the defendants are found liable to the plaintiffs' (sic) the plaintiffs
and defendants have reached an agreement as to the total
amount which is
payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs pursuant to the 93/94 policy being
the amount of $253,000.  This amount
takes into account all amounts paid by the
plaintiffs to settle the claim less all appropriate recoveries, deals with all
questions
of costs incurred by the plaintiffs and takes into account the
questions excesses deductibles.  It is the intent of this agreement
as to the
amount which would be payable if the defendants are found liable that it take
into account all of the issues raised by
paragraphs B2 and C14 of the
plaintiff's summons; the issues raised by paragraph 13 of the amended points of
defence and the issue
raised in the second part of paragraph 14(e) (beginning
`Alternatively ..') of the amended points of defence.  The result would be
that
if the plaintiffs were liable there would be an order that the defendants pay
to the plaintiffs the sum of $253,000.  This agreement
leaves the issues of
liability and costs (of these proceedings to be determined by the
Court)."</b>
<P>

It appears that the word "of" has been omitted after the word "questions" in
line 8, although nothing turns on that.
<P>

The parties agreed that this also left for determination the question of from
when, if at all, interest was to run on that amount
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psabaa1941385/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.57</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a></b> 1984 (Cth), ("the Act").
<P>

13   	The salient facts can be summarised thus:-
<P>

(a)	The plaintiffs entered into contracts of insurance with the defendants for
the periods 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 and 1 July
1994 to 30 June 1995.
<P>

(b)	The defendants agreed to indemnify the plaintiffs against any claims first
made against the plaintiffs by their clients between
1 July 1993 and 30 June
1994 whenever the basis for the claim had arisen in the past provided notice
was given to the defendants
during the period of insurance; and against any
claims made by clients of the plaintiffs against the plaintiffs after the
period
of insurance, which claims arose out of circumstances of which the
plaintiffs became aware between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 1994,
and of which
circumstances notice was given to the defendants during that period, whenever
such a claim was made by the client upon
the plaintiffs.
<P>

(c)	In early February 1994 the plaintiffs became aware of circumstances, which
may give rise to a claim against them.
<P>

(d)	The plaintiffs did not give notice to the defendants of those circumstances
during the 1993-1994 insurance year; nor, in so
far as it may be thought to be
relevant, during the 1994-1995 year.
<P>

(e)	The plaintiffs gave notice of the claim made against them in September 1995
on or about 28 September 1995.
<P>

(f)	The defendants denied liability to pay the claim under the 1993-1994 policy
as no claim was made by the plaintiffs during the
period of that policy, and as
they had not been given notice of the relevant circumstances during that
period.  They denied liability
under the 1994-1995 policy for those reasons and
because of the failure to disclose the circumstances when the plaintiffs
applied
for that year's insurance. 
<P>

(g)	The defendants did not assert that they had suffered any prejudice by
reason of the failure to give notice.
<P>

<b>The Present Proceedings</b>
<P>

14   	By a Summons filed on 9 February 1999, the plaintiffs
sought a declaration that they are entitled to be indemnified by the
defendants
under the 1993-1994 policy for the loss they had sustained and  consequential
orders and relief.  Under the heading "Issues
Likely to Arise", it was
stated:-
<P>

<b>"1.	Whether the plaintiffs' failure to notify the defendants of the
circumstances from which the claim arose is an omission to which
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.54</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a>, (1984) (Cth) applies such that the defendants may not
refuse to indemnify the plaintiffs in respect of their loss under the policy
in
force in the 1993/1994 financial year.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	Quantum of the loss."</b>
<P>

15   	The Plaintiffs' Contentions set out the matters to which I
have referred and the Defence initially raised, essentially, two
issues.
Firstly, whether a claim had been made conformably with the policy.  Secondly,
whether by their Cross-Claim the plaintiffs
had admitted they were not insured
such that they are now precluded from asserting that they were.  By an
amendment to the Defence,
to which I shall refer in more detail, the defendants
pleaded a failure by the plaintiffs to act with the utmost good faith within
the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.14(1)</a> of the Act.
<P>

16   	The matter proceeded on the basis of the Agreed Statement
of Facts, certain other agreements to which I have referred and
which were
reached during the hearing, and my being entitled to have regard to any
relevant admissions on the pleadings in these
proceedings.
<P>

17   	Mr Marshall accepted that if there had been a notification
of the circumstances during the 1993-1994 policy year and, in September
1995,
the claim had been made, the effect of the policy would have been such that the
plaintiffs could have obtained cover by virtue
of clause 4(b), which would have
deemed the claim to have been made in the 1993-1994 insurance year and,
therefore, to be within
the scope of the cover.  He stated that the real reason
for declining indemnity was that no claim was made during the currency of
that
policy.
<P>

18   	Judgment was reserved on 18 August 1999.  On 24 August
1999, my Associate received a letter from Mr Marshall stating that
he had found
two further authorities and wished to prepare a short supplementary written
submission in relation to them.  That was
filed on 1 September 1999 and, in
addition to quite detailed further submissions, appended a proposed amended
defence seeking to
raise the allegation that because of their deliberate
election not to invoke clause 4(b) the plaintiffs had failed to act with the
utmost good faith within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.14(1)</a>, such that they ought to be
precluded from relying on that clause.  The particulars relied on the
deliberate election not to give
notice; the agreed facts in paragraphs 6, 7 and
11 of Exhibit A, viz the decision to seek legal advice after the suggestion
that
the defendants should not be notified because of the potential impact on
future premiums and the taking and acceptance of that legal
advice; and the
knowledge that the notification to the plaintiffs may give rise to
circumstances which may, in turn, give rise to
a claim on the plaintiffs.
<P>

19   	On 10 September 1999 the plaintiffs furnished written
submissions in response in which, inter alia, they opposed the granting
of
leave to amend.  Because of this I re-listed the matter on 17 September 1999.
Mr Einfeld stated that the plaintiffs would suffer
no prejudice if leave to
amend were granted having regard to the narrow factual issue, which was not in
contest, on which reliance
was placed, and I was requested to deal with that
application, and, if I granted leave, the further substantive matter on the
written
submissions.  I again reserved my decision.
<P>

20   	As no prejudice was suggested, I think it appropriate to
grant the defendants leave to amend in the form of the document annexed
to Mr
Marshall's written submissions of 1 September 1999, and I do so.
<P>

<b>The Basic Submissions</b>
<P>

21   	Mr Einfeld submitted, and as I have indicated so much was
not in issue, that if the plaintiffs had given notice of the circumstances
during the period provided by the 1993-1994 policy and notwithstanding that the
claim was not made until 27 September 1995, the defendants
would have been
liable to indemnify them, so long as the circumstances of which notice was
given gave rise to the claim made in September
1995, which they clearly did.
The only missing element, therefore, was the giving of such notice, which, he
submitted, was an "omission"
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.54(1)</a> and (6) of the Act
in consequence of which the defendants could not refuse to indemnify.
<P>

22   	Mr Einfeld appreciated that this submission challenged the
Court of Appeal's decision in <b>FAI General Insurance Company Limited v
Perry</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 89</a>, which is indistinguishable on the facts and which
is binding on me unless it has been over-ruled by a subsequent decision of the
Court of Appeal, which it has not, or by a decision of the High Court.  Another
basis for its not being binding on me may be that
it is inconsistent with
subsequent decisions of other intermediate Courts of Appeal dealing with the
Act, which is of national application:
<b>Australian Securities Commission v
Marlborough Gold Mines Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 485</a> at 492.  
<P>

23   	Mr Einfeld submitted, firstly, that the High Court's
decision in <b>Antico v Heath Fielding Australia Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20652" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR
652</a> had over-ruled <b>Perry</b>, notwithstanding that the subsequent decision
of the Court of Appeal in <b>Greentree &amp; Anor v FAI General Insurance Co
Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/544.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 544</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20706" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 706</a> held that whilst certain reasoning in
<b>Perry</b> had been disapproved by the High Court in <b>Antico</b>, the
result in <b>Perry</b> had not been over-ruled.  A similar view, which was
accepted by the Court of Appeal in <b>Greentree</b>, had been expressed by
Hodgson CJinEq in <b>Permanent Trustee Australia &amp; Anor v FAI General
Insurance Co Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/1011.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 1011</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20186" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 186.</a>  He further submitted that
<b>Perry</b> was inconsistent with the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal
in <b>East End Real Estate Pty Limited v C.E. Heath Casualty &amp; General
Insurance Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 400</a>, which was expressly approved by the
High Court in <b>Antico</b>, and that it had not been followed, in relevantly
indistinguishable circumstances, by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of
Queensland in <b>FAI General Insurance Company Limited v Australian Hospital
Care Pty Limited</b> (9 July 1999 - unreported), which decision was consistent
with that of the Full Court of the Federal Court in <b>HIH Casualty and General
Insurance Australia Limited v Dellavedova</b> (15 April 1999 - unreported).
Both cases raised the same point as <b>Perry</b> but came to the conclusion
expressly in <b>Australian Hospital Care</b>, and impliedly in
<b>Dellavedova</b>, that <b>Perry</b> should not be followed.  Both decisions
post dated <b>Greentree</b>, which was referred to in <b>Australian Hospital
Care</b>.  Neither Court stated that the decision in <b>Perry</b> or, for that
matter <b>Greentree</b>, precluded the result reached by reason of the
principles in <b>Marlborough</b>.  I draw this inference from the failure of
either to refer to <b>Marlborough</b>.
<P>

Mr Einfeld's submission thus involved the proposition that I should not follow
<b>Perry</b>, because it was either over-ruled by the High Court or by
<b>Australian Hospital Care</b> and <b>Dellavedova</b>, and notwithstanding
that the Court of Appeal has said subsequently that the result has not been
over-ruled.  He submitted that the
decision in <b>Greentree</b>, relevantly for
present purposes, was <i>obiter dicta</i>.
<P>

24   	The range of the doctrine of precedent, and the duties of
a trial Judge conformably with it, were forcefully pointed out by
Moffitt P in
<b>Proctor v Jetway Aviation Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NSWLR%20166" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NSWLR 166</a> at pp.171-174.
His Honour stated, p.171, that a decision of the Court of Appeal is binding on
a Judge in my position unless and until
over-ruled by the High Court or the
Privy Council or departed from by the Court of Appeal.  He emphasised that
Judges at first instance
were not free to draw subtle distinctions in decisions
of, or assume that certain matters had been overlooked by, the Court of Appeal,
or otherwise seek to distinguish its decisions on narrow grounds or fine
points.  The necessity of obedience to precedent and the
reason therefor were
firmly stated.  A further matter in relation to precedent to which regard must
be had emerges from the joint
judgment in <b>Marlborough</b>, at p.492:-
<P>

<b>"Although the considerations applying are somewhat different from those
applying in the case of Commonwealth legislation, uniformity
of decision in the
interpretation of uniform national legislation such as the Law is a
sufficiently important consideration to require
that an intermediate appellate
court - and all the more so a single judge - should not depart from an
interpretation placed on such
legislation by another Australian intermediate
appellate court unless convinced that that interpretation is plainly
wrong."</b>
<P>

This passage was applied in relation to the <b>Trade Practices Act </b>1974 in
<b>Huntsman Chemical Company Australia Limited v International Pools Australia
Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 242.</a>
<P>

25   	I am thus left in the somewhat invidious situation where
important reasoning supporting the result in <b>Perry </b>has been disapproved
by the High Court in <b>Antico </b>in circumstances in which that Court has
upheld the reasoning in <b>East End</b>, which, on one view, is at odds with
that in <b>Perry</b>, but in circumstances where the Court of Appeal, albeit,
in my view, <i>obiter dicta</i>, has said in <b>Greentree</b> that whilst the
reasoning has been over-ruled, the decision has not.  However, the Court of
Appeal did not, so far as I can see,
suggest any other reasoning which would
support the majority views.  Hodgson CJinEq came to the same view in
<b>Permanent Trustee</b>.  Since those decisions, two intermediate courts of
appeal have declined, either expressly or impliedly, to follow <b>Perry</b>.
The problem is exacerbated for me because my own conclusion, to which I come
with the utmost respect, is that the effect of the
decision in <b>Antico</b>
was to over-rule, at least impliedly, <b>Perry</b>.  A simple escape from this
dilemma may be to say that whatever my decision there will, in all probability,
be an appeal to clarify
the situation.  However, I consider that my obligation
is to decide the case, in accordance with the law as I understand it, and
anything less would be a failing in my judicial duties.  Others will have to
decide the correctness of my view.
<P>

26   	Mr Marshall's principal submissions were, firstly, that
<b>Perry</b> was decided correctly and that it has not been over-ruled by the
decision in <b>Antico</b>.  The submission continued that the decisions in
<b>Permanent Trustee </b>and <b>Greentree</b>,<b> </b>particularly in the
judgment of the President at p.721, in whose reasons the Chief Justice at p.707
and Handley JA at p.723 agreed
subject to certain further observations their
Honours made, established that in their Honours' view the result in
<b>Perry</b>, as opposed to certain of the reasoning of the majority, had not
been over-ruled by <b>Antico</b>.  As I have said their Honours do not suggest,
to my observation, alternative reasoning and, further, what was said about
<b>Perry</b> was clearly <i>obiter dicta</i> as the question raised in that
case could have been determined on the basis that the claims made policy, on
which the insurer was
sought to be made liable, could not respond to the claim,
which was made long after the period of insurance had expired.  Therefore
no
claim was made to which the policy responded and no issue arose about the
insured receiving notice of circumstances likely to
give rise to the claim
during the period of insurance.
<P>

27   	Mr Marshall submitted that the defendants' entitlement to
deny liability was based on the failure of the 1993-1994 policy
to respond to
the claim because it was made outside the period provided for by that policy,
and the refusal to pay resulted from
that fact.  He submitted that the
plaintiffs' submission that reliance could be placed upon the deeming provision
of clause 4(b)
focused attention on the wrong question, the correct question
being the "gravamen" of the cover.  That submission picked up the words
of
Hodgson CJinEq in <b>Permanent Trustee</b>, at p.227, to which I shall
return.
<P>

28   	Mr Marshall submitted that s.40(3) of the Act provided, in
the case where the policy was silent on this point, for the circumstances
in
which an insured may give notice of facts that might give rise to a claim,
provided that was done as soon as was reasonably practicable
after the insured
became aware of those facts "but before the insurance cover provided by the
contract expired", and that this made
clear that notice of the circumstances
had to be given during the period of insurance.  Thus the section provided that
the insurer
is not relieved of liability under the contract in respect of the
claim, when made, "by reason only that it was made after the expiration
of the
period of the insurance cover provided by the contract".  Mr Marshall submitted
that this section provided a statutory "Condition
3" or "clause 4(b)" deeming
provision, and that it could not have been the intention of the legislature
that s.54(1) and (6) should
over-rule s.40(3) by providing that if the insured
did not give the notice "before the insurance cover provided by the contract
expired"
by reason of an "omission", including a deliberate choice or election,
the provisions of that section would be over-ruled.  His further
submissions
focussed on this point by reference to the decisions in <b>Newcastle City
Council v GIO General Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20191%20CLR%2085" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 191 CLR 85</a> and <b>Project Blue Sky Inc
&amp; Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20194%20CLR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 194 CLR 355.</a>
<P>

29   	Mr Marshall also submitted that if the plaintiffs'
submissions were correct the insurer would not know in which year the claim
would be brought.  In the present case he submitted it may have been brought in
the 1994-1995 year.  I do not think this is correct.
 The only policy which
could respond to the claim would be that for the 1993-1994 year, that being the
year in which awareness of
the circumstances occurred.  The failure to give
notice, which was the omission to which s.54 may be applicable, was a failure
or
omission during or in respect of that period of insurance.
<P>

<b>A Consideration Of The Submissions</b>
<P>

30   	Because of the problem I have about which principles of
precedent are appropriate, it is necessary to consider the submissions
in some
detail.  Mr Einfeld submitted that the determination of the issues depended on
the proper construction of s.54 in its application
to the particular facts of
this case and the terms of the policy, and that had the circumstances giving
rise to the claim been advised
to the plaintiffs during the relevant policy
year, the omission by them, although clearly an omission made in circumstances
where
they chose not to give notice, was none-the-less an omission to give such
notice, such that s.54 denied the defendants the right
not to indemnify.  The
submission was that that was an omission, which did not, upon a proper
construction of ss.54(1) and (6), entitle
the defendants to refuse to pay the
claim, but rather led to a situation, if the circumstances were appropriate,
whereby the amount
of the plaintiffs' claim against the defendants was to be
reduced by the amount that fairly represented the extent to which the
defendants'
interests were prejudiced as a result of it.  Thus s.54, if
applicable, adjusted the parties' rights by a quantification of the prejudice
suffered. In the present case he noted that as the defendants conceded that
there was no prejudice to them full effect could be given
to the remedial
provisions of s.54.  However, the force of the submission is that much of the
criticism that s.54 causes prejudice
to insurers, in the ways suggested by Cole
J in <b>Breville Appliances Pty Limited v Ducrou</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%207%20ANZ%20Insurance%20Cases%2061%2d125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 7 ANZ Ins Cas
61-125</a>, can be deflected once it is appreciated that in so far as the failure
to give notice has a prejudicial effect on the insurer that
will reduce the
amount the insured may recover.
<P>

31   	Mr Einfeld further submitted that in a claims made and
notified policy the insurer may be confronted with claims made many
years after
activities by the insured giving rise to them, so that any complaint that the
insurer was not able to adjust its position
at the end of each policy or
financial year did not reflect accurately the true financial situation in which
an insurer may find
itself.  Thus, by way of example, the 1993-1994 policy
could have covered a claim made by the plaintiffs upon the defendants in the
1993-1994 insurance year in respect of a claim made by a client on the
plaintiffs for negligent conduct some years earlier.  That
may give rise to the
same or similar types of prejudice identified by Cole J, but not in
circumstances where the insurer could complain
or have any redress.  Further,
if notice of circumstances had been given, such that a claim was deemed to have
been made in that
year, it may never mature into a claim, or it may not do so
for many years. Prima facie, one would anticipate that claims would be
made
within the usual limitation period of six years, but the Court has powers to
extend that period at the suit of an insured claimant.
 On the other hand, the
giving of notice has the important effect of allowing the insurer to
investigate the circumstances at the
earliest possible opportunity.  However,
Mr Einfeld's response to that would be that if the insurer was unable to do so
and, in consequence,
suffered loss that would be accommodated by a financial
adjustment based on the prejudice occasioned.
<P>

32   	Mr Einfeld recognised that the decision of the Court of
Appeal in <b>Perry</b> governed the present case if it is still good law.  His
submission was that in <b>Antico </b>the High Court held, in the majority
judgment, that <b>Perry</b> was wrongly decided by the disapproval of critical
reasoning and, according to his submission, I should decline to follow
<b>Perry</b> and hold that the omission to give notice of the circumstances of
which the plaintiffs had become aware during the period of insurance,
and which
gave rise to the  claim against them, was an omission which did not entitle the
defendants to refuse to meet the claim.
 The submission continued that there
was no relevant distinction between the failure to give notice of a claim,
which, it was held
in <b>East End</b> could be cured by recourse to s.54 and
approved by the High Court, and a failure to give notice of circumstances,
which <b>Perry</b>, however, held could not be cured by recourse to s.54.
<P>

33   	In <b>Permanent Trustee</b>, at p.227, Hodgson CJinEq
said:-
<P>

<b>"It seems to me that much the same applies to the lack of a claim in a
claims-made policy: the gravamen of the refusal is not that
someone omitted to
do something, but rather that something did not happen.  In my opinion, this is
the true basis for the distinctions
drawn in cases such as <i>East End</i> and
<i>FAI General Insurance Co Limited v Perry</i>.  If the reason for refusal is
fairly characterised as being that someone omitted to do something, then this
is an omission to which
s.54 can apply; but if it is fairly characterised
rather as being that something did not happen, then this is not an omission to
which s.54 can apply, even if it is the case that this something would have
happened if one or more persons had acted in certain
ways."</b>
<P>

His Honour was focussing on the same type of problem as arose in
<b>Greentree</b>, viz the absence of a claim in the policy year during which
the policy covered claims made, thus providing nothing to activate the
policy.
It was in this sense that his Honour referred to something not happening, in
contradistinction to an omission.  However,
if a claim were made that,
conformably with <b>East End</b>, activated the policy, subject to the giving
of notice.  Failure to give notice was held to be an excusable omission.  In my
opinion,
if relevant circumstances came to the notice of the plaintiffs that
would mean that something happened and, relevantly for present
purposes, the
omission would be the failure to notify the insurer in accordance with the
policy.
<P>

34   	In <b>Greentree</b> Mason P referred, with obvious
approval, to the decision in <b>Permanent Trustee</b>.  This was understandable
as it raised essentially the same point. After a detailed consideration of the
relevant authorities, including
<b>East End</b>, his Honour concluded, at
p.721, having cited the passage in the joint judgment in <b>Antico</b> at
pp.669-670 upon which Mr Einfeld placed reliance for the proposition that
<b>Antico</b> over-ruled <b>Perry</b>:-
<P>

<b>"The words used in the concluding sentence and the passages from <i>FAI
General Insurance Co Limited v Perry</i></b><i> </i><b>cited by the High Court
from  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=30%20NSWLR%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">30 NSWLR 89</a> at 93 and 107, make it plain to me that the High Court was
rejecting portion of the reasoning in <i>FAI General Insurance Co Limited v
Perry</i>, but not questioning the result in that case."</b>
<P>

35   	After a further consideration of the reasoning in
<b>Antico</b> his Honour said, at p.722:-
<P>

<b>"It follows that <i>Antico</i> should not be read as over-ruling <i>FAI
General Insurance Co Limited v Perry</i>.  It certainly cannot be viewed as
authority for the proposition that the terms under which insurance cover is
defined in a claims
made policy are irrelevant to the causation inquiry which
s.54(1) mandates.  While portion of Gleeson CJ's judgment in <i>FAI General
Insurance Co Limited v Perry</i> contains reasoning relating to a choice or
election by the insured, such reasoning being disapproved by the High Court in
<i>Antico</i>, a distinction remains between terms of the policy which should
rightly be seen as conditions to be satisfied by the insured, and
terms which
might expand the scope of the policy itself: see Clarke, `After the Dust
Settles on <i>Antico</i>: <i>FAI v Perry</i> Lives' (1997) 9 ILJ 29 at 33.  It
will be obvious from what I have written that I have been greatly assisted by
this article.</b>
<P>

<b>The distinction is difficult to express definitively.  Ultimately, it is a
question of applying the words of s.54 and the policy it
expresses to the
substance of the words of a particular insurance policy.  Section 54 was not
available to cure the omission in <i>FAI General Insurance Co Limited v
Perry</i>, because the effect of doing so would have altered the scope of the
contract of insurance in such a way that it would have been impossible
for the
Court to find a sufficient causal connection between the terms of the policy
and the insurer's refusal to pay a particular
claim.  In <i>FAI General
Insurance Co Limited v Perry</i> and <i>Antico</i>, the Court was at pains to
identify the insured's rights existing under the contract at the time of the
claim.  Only when they were
understood was it possible to determine whether the
insurer's refusal of the claim could fairly be said to flow `by reason of' some
act (or omission) of the insured or of some other person.  Some acts or
omissions are simply `non events', in the sense of having
no connection with
the substantive rights conferred under the policy and negotiated between the
parties."</b>
<P>

36   	That, if I may say so with respect, was clearly correct in
<b>Greentree</b> as no claim was made while the policy was current.  Therefore,
nothing happened to activate the policy and the policy had nothing
to say about
a claim made after its expiry.  <b>East End</b> was a different case.  The
claim was made during the currency of the policy but notice of it was not given
within the stipulated
time.  Non-the-less the insured was able to recover.
This was not the cover the insurer had offered, but s.54 overcame that omission
and, in doing so, gave cover where a claim was made within time, but
notification was made after the contractually stipulated time.
 That was not
what the parties had contracted for.  In so far as the President said that some
acts or omissions are simply "non events"
and have no connection with
substantive rights conferred under the policy, that is undoubtedly correct.
But the failure to give notice
does have a connection with substantive rights.
In the case of a claim made or of becoming aware of circumstances which may
give
rise to a claim, notice must be given.  If, in the first case, the failure
to give notice is an "omission", as has been authoritatively
determined, it
seems to me that it is very strongly arguable that it also is in the second
case.  Indeed, in my respectful opinion,
consistency would demand that
approach.  In each case there is a failure to give notice in circumstances
where an event potentially
triggering the policy has occurred and, if notice is
given of that event, the policy will respond.  I do not see why the nature of
the event, provided it happens within the policy year, affects the consequence
of the failure to give notice of it, where the omission
is the failure to give
notice.
<P>

37   	In <b>Perry</b> Condition 3 was, to all intents and
purposes, in the same terms as clause 4(b) and the facts are not
distinguishable.  Although in
<b>East End</b> the Court, of which both Gleeson
CJ and Clarke JA were members, held that a failure to give notice of a claim
was an omission within
the meaning of s.54, in <b>Perry</b> their Honours held
that the failure to give notice of circumstances of which the insured became
aware was not such an omission. 
At p.93, Gleeson CJ said:-
<P>

<b>"Here the primary cover afforded by the policy is cover against claims made
and reported during the relevant period.  An insured who,
during the relevant
period, becomes aware of an occurrence and hence the possibility of a future
claim, is entitled,<u> if he or she chooses to do so, to notify the insurer and
thus extend the scope of the cover to future claims in respect of occurrences
discovered and notified during the relevant period</u>.  There could be reasons
why an insured would choose not to do so.  The possibility of a future claim
might, for a number of possible
reasons, be regarded as remote.  Notification
might indirectly affect future premiums.  <u>When one is dealing with claims
that are mere future possibilities, a decision not to elect to expand the scope
of the cover to include
such claims does not seem to me to constitute an
omission of the kind with which s.54 is concerned</u>.  Condition 3 is intended
to relieve an insured (in a way that is similar but not identical to the relief
given by s.40 of the Act)
against a certain practical problem that can arise in
liability insurance.  <u>It does that by giving the insured a choice.  The
insured may choose not to follow the course made available by Condition 3.  In
that
event I am unable to conclude that the absence of liability on the insurer
is by reason of an omission on the part of the insured
within the meaning of
s.54</u>."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

38   	His Honour thus held that the insured may extend the scope
of the cover from claims made against it and reported during the
relevant
period to claims arising out of circumstances of which the insured has notice
during the period of insurance, and of which
circumstances the insured gives
notice during that period to the insurer, which circumstances, in the absence
of notice of them and
subsequent claims arising from them, would not be covered
by the policy.  His Honour's reasoning continued on the basis that there
was no
obligation on the insured to give notice in the latter case, and thereby
increase the scope of the cover, and that there may
be reasons why the insured
would choose not to do so.  He considered that if the insured chose to adopt
the course of not giving
notice, for reasons which appealed to the insured,
that would not constitute an omission, but rather an election or choice not to
extend the scope of the insurance to subsequent claims arising from those
circumstances.  This was the reasoning set out at p.93
and it led his Honour to
the critical conclusion, on the basis of which he found that s.54 did not
apply.  Thus, in <b>East End</b>, his Honour had said that as the claim had
been made the insured event had occurred and the failure to give notice was an
omission.
 In <b>Perry</b> the election or choice not to give notice of
circumstances was a matter which precluded the operation of the policy because
an insured
event did not happen until the notice was given and, thereafter, a
claim was made based on those circumstances, the policy not responding
merely
to the insured's knowledge of circumstances.  This was based, at least in part,
on his Honour's view that that exercise of
choice precluded an event to which
the policy responded coming about, and, because it was a matter of choice or
election, it could
not be an omission within the meaning of s.54.  However, his
Honour's decision was also based on the finding that the failure to
give notice
meant that the scope of cover was not increased as clause 4(b) provided, the
primary cover, as I have said, being in
respect of claims made.  Independently
of his Honour's views about choice or election (and there is an element of
choice or election
in giving notice of a claim made), his Honour's decision
would stand on the basis to which I have just referred.  But none-the-less
the
right to recover was lost, even though not the primary right, by reason of the
failure to give notice, which, arguably, was an
omission.  To conclude
otherwise could be said, if I may say so with respect, to allow form to triumph
over substance.
<P>

39   	At p.107, Clarke JA said:-
<P>

<b>"Despite the obvious width of the language in s.54 it operates only where
the effect of the contract is that an insurer might refuse
to pay a claim
because of an act (omission) of the insured or some other person.  As <i>East
End</i> makes clear it does not matter whether the insurance policy achieves
this effect in the definition of the cover or by the imposition
of obligations
the breach of which entitles the insurer to avoid the policy.  Nonetheless it
is essential that the contract have
that effect before s.54 operates.</b>
<P>

<b>Upon the assumption I have made for the purposes of the argument, the
contract under consideration (upon the assumption that Condition
3 was not in
the contract) would not have that effect.  The position under the contract
would simply be that the insured could claim
only if the claim was made and
notified within the period of the policy.  In those circumstances it could not
be said that the fact
that the insured had not notified the existence of facts
within the period constituted an act (omission) by reason of which the insurer
could exercise a right under the policy to deny a claim.</b>

<b>....  <u>What, as it seems to me, s.54 is concerned with is the loss by an
assured of a right to claim under a policy by reason of some act
or omission -
either of the insured or some other person.  It assumes the existence of a
right which by virtue of the contractual
provisions is lost.  But in the
circumstances under discussion here there is no right which has been lost.  All
that has occurred
is that the insured has not taken action, the effect of which
would be to enable a claim to be made for which (on the stated hypothesis)
the
policy does not provide</u>."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

Accordingly, it seems clear that his Honour's <i>ratio decidendi</i> founded
upon the absence of "an omission" in circumstances where the insured had
elected not to give notice, and thus not to take
the "action" to the effect of
which his Honour referred.  It seems to me, with respect, that that reasoning
is far closer to identifying
that which is an "omission" for the purposes of
s.54.  However, it may be argued, consistently with his Honour's reasons, that
becoming
aware of circumstances which may possibly give rise to a claim gave
rise to a right, which right was lost by virtue of the failure
to comply with
the contractual provision requiring the giving of notice.  That approach would
have been entirely consistent with
<b>East End</b>.
<P>

40   	The disapproving passage in the judgment of Dawson,
Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in <b>Antico</b>, which follows an acceptance by
their Honours of the correctness of <b>East End</b>, is in the following
terms:-
<P>

<b>"Section 54 does not postulate a liability of the insurer to pay a claim
which has been made.  <u>Rather, it takes as its starting point the existence
of a claim and a contract the effect of which is that the insurer may refuse
to
pay the claim</u>.  The section directs attention to the reason founding the
refusal, namely a particular act or omission on the part `of the insured
or of
some other person'.  The term `act', when used in s.54, includes a reference to
an omission (s.54(6)(a)).</b>
<P>

<b>Section 54(1) uses the phrase `by reason of some act of the insured or of
some other person'.  It does not specify the act or omission
of the insured as
being a failure to discharge an obligation owed by the insured to the insurer.
<u>The legislation is expressed in broad terms and, on its face, there is no
reason why the omission of the insured may not be a failure
to exercise a
right, choice or liberty which the insured enjoys under the contract of
insurance</u>.  In any event, the act or omission may be that of a third party,
`some other person', who is unlikely to be a party to the contract
of insurance
in question.  Submissions by the respondent which were contrary to the above
construction of s.54(1) and which apparently
were based upon the reasoning of
the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <i>FAI General Insurance Co v Perry</i>
(26) should be rejected."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

Footnote 26 refers to pp.93 and 107 of <b>Perry</b>, at which the reasoning of
the Chief Justice and Clarke JA appears respectively.  Mr Einfeld submitted
that the disapproval of this
reasoning necessarily meant that the conclusion on
which it was founded was also disapproved and, notwithstanding that the High
Court
did not in terms over-rule <b>Perry</b>, the effect of <b>Antico</b> was
to bring about that result.  Unassisted by the decisions in <b>Permanent
Trustee</b> and <b>Greentree</b>, I would have accepted this submission.  In my
respectful opinion, the reasoning in <b>Perry</b>, which failed to find favour
in <b>Antico</b>, was the reasoning which underpinned the decisions of  Gleeson
CJ and Clarke JA.  In <b>Perry</b>, Kirby P dissented, although from the point
of view of the precedent effect of <b>Perry</b> that is not relevant.  Once
that reasoning was removed, and no other reasoning was shown to justify the
decision, I consider, with
the greatest respect, that <b>Perry</b> can no
longer stand.
<P>

41   	The view I have just expressed was applied by the Full
Court of the Federal Court in <b>Dellavedova</b>.  The policy under
consideration and the relevant facts were relevantly indistinguishable from
those in the present case.  At paragraph
28 their Honours said:-
<P>

<b>"Alternatively, if it were contended by the insurers under the 1993
certificate that the respondents had chosen not to exercise the
right to extend
the cover of the certificate under clause 4(b) of the certificate by advising
the insurers of those circumstances,
such an omission would be one to which
s.54(1) of the ICA would apply with the result that the insurers could not
refuse to indemnify
the respondents under the certificate."</b>
<P>

Their Honours referred to <b>Antico</b>.  They do not appear to have been
referred to, and they did not refer to, <b>Greentree</b>.  It is clear that
they considered <b>Antico</b> was authority for the proposition I have
quoted.
<P>

42   	In <b>Australian Hospital Care</b> the majority,
Derrington and Chesterman JJ, concluded in separate judgments that the result
in <b>Perry</b> could not survive <b>Antico</b>.  Pincus JA dissented.  The
factual circumstances and the terms of the policy were relevantly
indistinguishable from the present
case.  Their Honours were referred to and
considered <b>Greentree</b>.  Derrington J expressed his primary conclusions in
paragraphs 37-46.  Chesterman J said, paragraph 30:-
<P>

<b>"The High Court approached the construction of s.54 in a way which, in my
respectful opinion, makes the distinction between <i>East End</i> and
<i>Perry</i> untenable.  <i>Antico</i> decided that s.54 <u>did</u> apply to
the insured's failure to seek consent.  The policy itself provided in what
circumstances the insurer could refuse consent
and so the matter was remitted
to the Supreme Court for a determination whether, if the failure to ask for
consent was overlooked,
the insurer would have been obliged to indemnify its
insured."  (His Honour's emphasis.)</b>
<P>

At paragraph 35 his Honour said that the reasoning in <b>Antico</b> "cuts
through both strands of the reasoning which supported Perry".
<P>

43   	If the matter were one which I was deciding unaided by
<b>Perry</b>, <b>Greentree</b> and <b>Permanent Trustee</b>, I would
respectfully adopt, essentially, the reasoning of Chesterman J, including his
Honour's observations in paragraph 51.  I
would do so on the basis that <b>East
End</b> was binding on me.
<P>

44   	The question is whether I can take this position.
Firstly, the High Court did not state expressly in <b>Antico</b> that <b>Perry
</b>was being over-ruled, and it may be thought by others that all their
Honours were saying was that in so far as Gleeson CJ and Clarke
JA stated what
may constitute an omission, they did so too narrowly, but in circumstances
where, as Mason P has said, the reasoning
was disapproved but the result was
not over-ruled.  Secondly, other Judges of this Court, including the unanimous
decision of the
Court of Appeal in <b>Greentree</b>, have concluded that the
result in <b>Perry</b> has not been over-ruled, albeit in <b>Greentree</b> the
observations were <i>obiter</i>.  Thirdly, the doctrine of precedent demands
that I should follow decisions of the Court of Appeal, in so far as they have
not been
over-ruled by the High Court, and, in so far as they have been
over-ruled by the High Court, decisions of the High Court.  The present
case is
indistinguishable from <b>Perry</b>.  The High Court did not say it was
over-ruling the result in <b>Perry</b>, and the Court of Appeal in
<b>Greentree</b> has said that the High Court did not over-rule the result in
<b>Perry</b>.
<P>

45   	However, the final question is the regard I should have to
<b>Marlborough</b> in circumstances where:-
<P>

(a)	the High Court has disapproved vital reasoning in Perry;
<P>

(b)	the High Court has expressly approved the reasoning in <b>East End</b>;
<P>

(c)	the Court of Appeal has accepted that disapproval, but said the decision is
not affected, albeit <i>obiter</i>; and
<P>

(d)	two other intermediate appellate Courts have since then assumed or held
that <b>Perry</b> has been over-ruled by <b>Antico</b> and, in one case,
notwithstanding <b>Greentree</b>.  Those Courts did not feel constrained by
<b>Marlborough</b>.
<P>

In all these circumstances, I consider that my duty is to conclude that
<b>Perry</b> has been over-ruled and to follow the decisions in
<b>Dellovedova</b> and <b>Australian Hospital Care</b>.
<P>

<b>The Further Defences</b>
<P>

46   	I do not consider that there is an inconsistency between
ss.40 and 54.  I am of the view that Mr Marshall has correctly characterised
the role of s.40 in the terms to which I have referred.  In my opinion, to the
extent that that section provides a statutory extension
to the policy there is
no reason why the ameliorating provisions of s.54 cannot apply to it.
<P>

47   	Further, I am of the opinion that the defence under s.14
cannot succeed.  In <b>Antico</b> the High Court held that in so far as the
exercise of an election or choice was held to be a disqualifying factor, the
provisions
of s.54 could none-the-less apply.  Further, to imply an absence of
the utmost good faith in this case would mean that the beneficial
effect of
s.54 would be lost.  Finally, there is no suggestion that the failure to give
notice in this case arose in consequence
of any lack of good faith.  It was an
omission but, on the agreed facts, it cannot be characterised as one springing
from a lack
of good faith.
<P>

48   	I do not consider that the statement in the Cross-Claim,
which I have quoted, and any similar statements to the same effect,
preclude
the plaintiffs from bringing these proceedings or demand that the result of
them should be that the plaintiffs fail.  Mr
Marshall placed emphasis upon the
fact that the pleading was verified, but the verification was confined to
matters of fact and,
in so far as the pleading asserted an absence of
insurance, that was clearly a matter of mixed fact and law.
<P>

49   	In <b>Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
170 CLR 70</a> Mason CJ and Brennan J said, at p.85:-
<P>

<b>"The appellant's case is that each and every present member of the Tribunal
must be regarded as asserting a belief in the truth or
correctness of these
defences on the footing that the Tribunal is continuing to maintain the
defences in the action.  This submission
cannot be accepted for two reasons.
First, as the Defence was not verified on oath and was not required to be
verified, it does not
amount to an assertion of belief in the correctness of
the facts pleaded.  Indeed, traditional principle is that assertions in
pleadings
do not amount to admissions."</b>
<P>

50   	After a consideration of the case law their Honours said,
at p.86:-
<P>

<b>"The suggestion that pleadings should be treated in the same way as any
other form of admission fails, in our view, to take account
of the function and
objects of pleadings, when they are not required to be verified, in outlining
the party's case and defining the
issues to be tried."</b>
<P>

51   	In the present case, of course, Mr Marshall emphasised the
fact that the Cross-Claim was verified.  I have referred to the
limited nature
of the verification.  In these circumstances, I do not conclude that the
pleading of the Cross-Claim precludes the
plaintiffs succeeding.
<P>

<b>Interest</b>
<P>

52   	There was argument as to the time from when interest
should run.  Mr Einfeld submitted that it should be from when the defendants
had had a reasonable opportunity to consider the claim and elected not to pay
it.  Mr Marshall submitted that even if <b>Perry</b> is over-ruled it was
reasonable for the defendants not to pay until that happened, as they were
entitled to rely on the applicability
of <b>Perry</b>.  
<P>

53   	Section 57 provides that interest is payable in accordance
with that section, sub-s.2 stating that the period in respect of
which interest
is payable is that commencing on the day as and from which it was unreasonable
for the insurer to have withheld payment
of the amount and ending, in effect,
when payment is made.  Mr Marshall submitted that it has never been
unreasonable for the defendants
to refuse to make payment, because they have
been entitled to rely upon the decision in <b>Perry</b>, in which judgment was
delivered on 24 March 1993.
<P>

54   	As I would understand it, if <b>Perry</b> is over-ruled so
that the plaintiffs succeed, the legal theory is that the law always has been
as stated in the decision over-ruling
<b>Perry</b>.  In most cases an insurer,
which refuses to meet a claim, will rely on factual and/or legal matters, which
it considers reasonably
entitle it to take that stance.  If the matter is
litigated the Court will decide whether that position was justified.  If it
concludes
that it was not interest will generally run from the date when the
Court considers the insurer had had a reasonable time to investigate
the claim
and decide how it would respond to it.  Thereafter, the insurer takes the risk
that its view of the facts and/or law is
correct.  There is, perhaps, no more
justification for thinking that its view of the facts will ultimately be
upheld, than that its
view of the law will be.  The law is ever changing.
Therefore, in the present case I see no reason why interest should not run from
22 December 1995 by which time the defendants had made their decision.  This is
consistent with the fundamental premises which underlie
the payment of
interest.  Firstly, the insurer must have a reasonable opportunity to consider
the claim.  Secondly, having had that
opportunity and formed a view on which it
acts, the insurer takes the risk that that view may not be upheld by the Court.
Thirdly,
in the meantime the insurer has had the benefit of the money it is
ordered to pay and the insured has been deprived of that benefit.
<P>

<b>Matters For Concern</b>
<P>

55   	The Act is a Commonwealth Act with the stated purpose to
reform and modernise the law relating to certain contracts of insurance
for the
purposes mentioned. It is regarded as remedial legislation. In relation to
claims made and notified policies it has given
rise to much litigation.  Within
this State <b>East End</b> and <b>Perry</b> are arguably at odds and
<b>Perry</b>, arguably, has been over-ruled.  The Full Court of the Federal
Court and the Court of Appeal of Queensland have come to a view about
the
applicability of <b>Antico</b> to the result in <b>Perry</b> different from
that expounded by the Court of Appeal in this State in <b>Greentree</b>.
Neither the Full Court of the Federal Court nor the Queensland Court of Appeal
felt constrained by the decision of the High Court
in <b>Marlborough </b>in so
concluding.
<P>

56   	The consequence may be that depending on where litigation
is brought on a claims made and notified policy, at least where
the issue is
that there was no timely notification, different results may be expected.
Indeed proceedings arising in New South Wales
may receive a different result if
decided by the Federal Court than if decided by this Court.  Insured parties
practising throughout
Australia may receive different results depending on the
Court in which they sue or are sued.  If I may say so with respect, I consider
that this is most unsatisfactory state of affairs, which should be resolved as
soon as possible.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

57   	The orders I propose are:-
<P>

(a)	Judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $253,000 on which interest will
be payable from 22 December 1995 to to-day's date
on the formula in the
Regulations to the Act.
<P>

(b)	The defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings including the
costs of the amendment to the Defence.
<P>

(c)	The exhibits be returned.
<P>

The parties should bring in Short Minutes of Order to give effect to these
proposed orders.
