<b>50258/1996 - HUNGRY JACK'S PTY LIMITED v BURGER KING CORPORATION &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>ADDENDUM TO JUDGMENT OF 5 NOVEMBER 1999</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	On 5 November 1999 I published my reasons for judgment and
stood the proceedings over to 12 November 1999 for the parties to
bring in
Short Minutes of Order to give effect to my findings.  I shall assume that the
reader of this addendum has access to that
judgment, and I shall use the
references in it in these reasons.
<P>

2   	When the matter was called on 12 November 1999 the parties
stated that they had not finished preparing draft orders.  Mr Sullivan
of
Queen's Counsel, who appeared for Shell, requested me to recall my judgment to
delete certain portions thereof, which related
to and caused concern to his
client.   It will be remembered that on the first day of the hearing HJPL and
Shell settled the proceedings
between them and, thereafter, Shell took no
further part in this litigation.
<P>

3   	Mr Sullivan had proposed to furnish to my Associate on 11
November 1999 a letter setting out those portions of the judgment
on which he
wished to comment, but did not do so as the solicitors for HJPL took the view
that the matter should be "dealt with in
a formal manner".  It was,
accordingly, mentioned in open Court on 12 November 1999.
<P>

4   	The settlement between HJPL and Shell left in issue whether
BKC's dealings with Shell had caused BKC to breach its fiduciary
duties to
HJPL, which I found they had.  However, conformably with its settlement with
Shell, HJPL was not to advance a case that
Shell had breached any fiduciary
duties it owed to HJPL by reason of any dealings it, Shell, had with BKC.  
<P>

5   	In his letter, which was handed up, without objection, on
12 November 1999 and which will remain with the papers, Mr Sullivan
stated:-
<P>

<b>"Shell has received and considered a copy of your Honour's Reasons for
Judgment delivered on 5 November 1999.  It has observed in
paragraph 369 of
your Honour's Reasons, your Honour expresses the view or `finding'
that:-</b>
<P>

<b>`.. The arrangements into which they entered created, in the view to which I
have come, fiduciary obligations between them, which
were breached by BKC
<u>and Shell</u> prior to the entry into the Tripartite Test Agreement'
(emphasis added).</b>
<P>

<b>Shell has also noted that in your Reasons for Judgment, your Honour sets out
that submissions were made (presumably by the Plaintiff)
that Shell owed and/or
breached fiduciary duties (see paragraphs 14, 300, 302 and 345 of the
Reasons)."</b>
<P>

6   	The letter referred to the fact that Shell had not been
heard on any such matters; that the Deed of Settlement between HJPL
and Shell
precluded HJPL from advancing any such submissions against Shell; and that
HJPL's solicitors had advised Shell's solicitors
that no submissions were made
to the Court "that Shell breached any fiduciary duty it may have owed to the
Plaintiff.  Moreover,
it appears that, given the way the case was run and the
orders sought (see, e.g. paragraph 29 of the Reasons), it was unnecessary
for
the Court to make any finding that Shell owed a fiduciary duty to the
Plaintiff, let alone breached any such duty".
<P>

7   	In addition to the matters to which I have referred in
relation to Shell, I should state that Mr Sullivan's letter pointed
out that
Shell, in its defence, denied that it owed or breached any fiduciary duty to
HJPL; stated that it had no notice of the possibility
of any adverse findings
or view being made or expressed about its conduct; and stated that it did not
have the opportunity to call
or challenge evidence or to make submissions as to
whether it owed or breached a fiduciary duty to HJPL. 
<P>

8   	It must, of course, be steadfastly borne in mind that the
case before me was conducted on the basis that BKC, by its dealings
with Shell,
breached its fiduciary duty to HJPL.
<P>

<b>Jurisdiction</b>
<P>

9   	The parties did not suggest that I did not have
jurisdiction to amend my reasons at this stage, if I thought it appropriate,
nor did any party raise any objection to my doing so.  Mr Hutley stated that he
did not wish to be heard on the matter.  Mr Oslington
took the same approach,
although he added, lest his silence should be misinterpreted, that if by
amending any part of my original
reasons that provided BKC and/or BKAL with
another ground or grounds of appeal, his clients would be relying upon it or
them.
<P>

<b>Shell's Application</b>
<P>

10   	The first two amendments I have been asked to make relate
to paragraph 14, which reads:-
<P>

<b>"A particular area of dispute concerns the relationship developed between
HJPL, BKC and Shell.  This involved several elements after
initial discussions
between HJPL and Shell, and BKC and Shell.  One was the negotiation for and
subsequent entry into a tripartite
test development agreement, pursuant to
which several restaurants would be opened at Shell controlled service station
sites to see
whether the co-branding of petroleum products and a fast food
restaurant would be successful, and also the extent to which the three
companies could work together in that venture.  Although the agreement was
signed in February 1995 and exchanged in March 1995, the
parties had been
pursuing the arrangements since late 1993 or early 1994.  The parties proceeded
with the test on the basis that
if it was successful they would enter into a
long-term relationship for the development of a number of restaurants at Shell
sites.
 Shell suggested there may be as many as 70.  HJPL's case was that prior
to the entry into that agreement, the parties were working
towards the
formation of a long-term relationship for the mutual financial benefit of each.
It is alleged by HJPL that BKC and Shell,
contrary to the spirit and intent of
that agreement and the arrangement for the long-term relationship, and thus in
breach of a fiduciary
duty allegedly owed to HJPL, sought to deal with each
other to achieve the same end but to the exclusion of HJPL.  The submission
was
that the evidence established that prior to 1994 Shell had been dealing
separately with each of BKC and HJPL because it was interested
in introducing
fast food restaurants at its service station sites.  By March 1994 the parties
came together to seek to develop the
test agreement and long-term arrangement
to which I have referred.  Subsequently, and it will be necessary to consider
the evidence
in detail, Shell advised BKC that it was not prepared to go ahead
if HJPL was involved. BKC did not seek to change Shell's attitude
on this and,
on one view, encouraged it not to proceed with HJPL, whilst pursuing
arrangements for Shell to enter into an arrangement
with it.  BKC did not
advise HJPL of its attitude, nor of Shell's, until Mr Fitzjohn wrote to Mr
Cowin on 15 May 1995. Although BKC
had been aware of Shell's attitude to HJPL
for some months prior to May 1995, it not only did not advise HJPL of it, but
it allowed
HJPL to continue with the test arrangements, with the expense and
time that involved, in the knowledge that Shell was stating that
it would not
participate in a long term dealing with HJPL.  When BKC told HJPL of the
position in May 1995, the tension between the
two was heightened. Thereafter
BKC sought to improve its own position in Australia through Shell to the
disadvantage of HJPL.  On
the basis of these submissions HJPL has put that BKC
and Shell breached fiduciary duties to it as a consequence of which it is
entitled
to equitable compensation from BKC."</b>
<P>

The amendments sought are within the category where I have set forth the
submissions made.
<P>

11   	The first amendment is to delete the words "and Shell" in
line 13.  I do not see those words in that line.  I have also been
asked to
delete the words "each other" in line 15 and insert in lieu thereof "Shell".  I
do not see those words in that line.  It
seems to me that the sentence to which
reference is being made is:-
<P>

<b>"It is alleged by HJPL that BKC <u>and Shell</u>, contrary to the spirit and
intent of that agreement and the arrangement for the long-term relationship,
and thus in breach of a
fiduciary duty allegedly owed to HJPL, sought to deal
with <u>each other</u> to achieve the same end but to the exclusion of
HJPL."</b>
<P>

That is a recitation of the submissions made.  I have not been referred to any
submission in those precise terms, and I have not,
in those circumstances, gone
back through the voluminous oral and written submissions.  In my opinion, the
sense of what I was seeking
to convey, without referring to any "fault" on the
part of Shell, is conveyed adequately if the sentence is amended to read:-
<P>

<b> "It is alleged by HJPL that BKC, contrary to the spirit and intent of that
agreement and the arrangement for the long-term relationship,
and thus in
breach of a fiduciary duty allegedly owed to HJPL, sought to deal with Shell to
achieve the same end but to the exclusion
of HJPL."</b>
<P>

12   	I have also been asked to delete the words "and Shell" in
the final sentence of paragraph 14.  In my opinion that amendment
should be
made for the same reason.  I propose to amend  the sentence to read:-
<P>

<b>"On the basis of these submissions HJPL has put that BKC breached fiduciary
duties to it as a consequence of which it is entitled
to equitable compensation
from BKC."</b>
<P>

It is quite clear from the balance of the paragraph that reference is being
made to BKC's dealings with Shell.
<P>

13   	Paragraph 300 is the next to which exception is taken.  I
have been asked to delete the words "and Shell" in line 4; and to
delete the
words "either" and "or Shell" in line 5.  Once again I was referring to the
submissions made. I think the words about
which complaint is made are:-
<P>

<b>"...gave rise to a series of fiduciary duties owed by BKC <u>and Shell</u>,
relevantly for present purposes, to HJPL, such that if <u>either</u> BKC <u>or
Shell</u> sought to subvert the arrangements ...".</b>
<P>

14   	In the passage I have just quoted I consider, essentially
for the reasons I have thus far given, that the words "and Shell";
and "either"
and "or Shell" should be deleted, so that the passage to which I have just
referred will read:-
<P>

<b>"...gave rise to a series of fiduciary duties owed by BKC, relevantly for
present purposes, to HJPL, such that if BKC  sought to subvert
the arrangements
...".</b>
<P>

15   	The next amendment I am asked to make is by deleting the
words "the two parties, namely" and "and Shell" in line 5 of paragraph
302.
That paragraph refers expressly to paragraph 30.3 of HJPL's written
submissions, which reads:-
<P>

<b>"By reason of that joint venture or proposed joint venture, BKC owed
fiduciary duties and obligations to HJPL, which required that
it not take
steps, either itself or in conjunction with Shell, to exclude HJPL from the
development, operation and/or servicing of
Burger King Restaurants at Shell
service stations in Australia (Summons para 29).  At the least, those duties
required that that
(sic) two parties must not secretly negotiate to exclude the
third from the proposed venture.  Alternatively, the dealings between
HJPL and
BKC, so far as they concerned negotiations with Shell, were directed to the
formation of a joint venture between HJPL and
BKC to establish and operate
Burger King Restaurants at Shell service stations in Australia, and BKC owed
HJPL fiduciary duties and
contractual duties of good faith in relation to that
matter."</b>
<P>

16   	Paragraph 302 reads:-
<P>

<b>"In paragraph 30.3 it was submitted that by reason of either the joint
venture or proposed joint venture, BKC owed fiduciary duties
and obligations to
HJPL, which required that it not take steps, either itself or in conjunction
with Shell, to exclude HJPL from
the development, operation and/or servicing of
Burger King restaurants at Shell service stations in Australia, and that those
duties
required that the two parties, namely BKC and Shell, must not secretly
negotiate to exclude HJPL from the proposed joint venture.
 Alternatively, it
was submitted, the dealings between HJPL and BKC, so far as they concerned
negotiations with Shell, were directed
to the formation of a joint venture
between HJPL and BKC to establish and operate Burger King restaurants at Shell
service stations
in Australia, and BKC owed HJPL fiduciary and contractual
duties of good faith in relation to that."</b>
<P>

What I have set out in paragraph 302 faithfully records the written submissions
of Mr Bathurst at paragraph 30.3 of his written
submissions, the reference to
the "two parties" clearly being a reference to BKC and Shell.  The solicitors
for HJPL have stated,
apparently, that this was not a submission that Shell
owed or breached a fiduciary duty.  I consider that the opening words make
clear that the allegation is one being made against BKC only, and the reference
to "secretly negotiating" is, in the circumstances,
only relevant to BKC's
conduct.  Accordingly, I do not propose to amend this paragraph.
<P>

17   	The next amendment I was asked to make was by deleting the
words "and Shell" in line 8 of paragraph 345.  I assume this is
a reference to
the submission that "BKC and Shell must not negotiate secretly ..".  In the
context of the whole submission I do not
consider that this could be read other
than as a reference to BKC's duties, and I do not propose to amend it.
<P>

18   	The next amendment I was asked to make was by deleting the
word "them" in the fourth last line of paragraph 369 and inserting
in lieu
thereof "HJPL and BKC".  The passage reads:-
<P>

<b>"No party had any intention to enter into a long-term relationship at that
time, but the arrangements into which they entered created,
in the view to
which I have come, fiduciary obligations between them, which were breached by
BKC and Shell prior to the entry into
the Tripartite Test Agreement."</b>
<P>

This was clearly a finding involving Shell and in lieu of the words "between
them", I consider that the words "between HJPL and
BKC" should be inserted, and
that the words "and Shell" should be deleted, so that the sentence reads:-
<P>

<b>"No party had any intention to enter into a long-term relationship at that
time, but the arrangements into which they entered created,
in the view to
which I have come, fiduciary obligations between HJPL and BKC, which were
breached by BKC prior to the entry into
the Tripartite Test Agreement."</b>
<P>

<b>Proposed Amendments</b>
<P>

19   	I propose that the sentences in paragraph 14, to which I
have referred, be amended to read:-
<P>

<b>"It is alleged by HJPL that BKC, contrary to the spirit and intent of that
agreement and the arrangement for the long-term relationship,
and thus in
breach of a fiduciary duty allegedly owed to HJPL, sought to deal with Shell to
achieve the same end but to the exclusion
of HJPL."</b>
<P>

<b>"On the basis of these submissions HJPL has put that BKC breached fiduciary
duties to it as a consequence of which it is entitled
to equitable compensation
from BKC."</b>
<P>

20   	I propose that the passage in paragraph 300, to which I
have referred in paragraph 13, be amended to read:-
<P>

<b>"...gave rise to a series of fiduciary duties owed by BKC, relevantly for
present purposes, to HJPL, such that if BKC  sought to subvert
the arrangements
...".</b>
<P>

21   	I propose that the sentence in paragraph 369 to which I
have referred in paragraph 18, be amended to read:-
<P>

<b>"No party had any intention to enter into a long-term relationship at that
time, but the arrangements into which they entered created,
in the view to
which I have come, fiduciary obligations between HJPL and BKC, which were
breached by BKC prior to the entry into
the Tripartite Test Agreement."</b>
<P>

22   	I shall give the parties the opportunity to consider these
reasons before making final orders.
<P>

<P>

On 19 November 1999 Shell advised that it did not require any further
amendments to the above judgment.
