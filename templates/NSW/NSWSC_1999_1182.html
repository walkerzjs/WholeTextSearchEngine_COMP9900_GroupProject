<b><u>30058/98 - DANIEL ANTOINE LAURENT &amp; ORS v </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>THE LAW SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT - </b>On subpoena to produce documents.
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:   The Plaintiffs in the principle proceedings, Daniel
Antoine Laurent,  Ormtrend Pty. Limited and Fabrama Pty. Limited,
seek by way
of summons against the Law Society of New South Wales ("the Law Society"), a
declaration challenging  Law Society Fidelity
Management Committee's
disallowance of the First Plaintiff's claim on the Fund for amounts of $317,500
and $322,804.70, and an order
in the nature of mandamus requiring the Law
Society to make determinations pursuant to s 79A (2)(b) of the Legal Profession
Act 1900
("the Act") in respect of such claims.
<P>

2  	Section 79A of the Act relevantly provides:
<P>

"(1)	In this Division, a reference to a failure to account is a reference to a
failure by a solicitor to account for, pay or deliver
money or other valuable
property received by, or entrusted to, the solicitor or an associate in the
course of the solicitor's practice
(in the case of an associate, being money or
valuable property under the direct or indirect control of the solicitor).
<P>

(2) 	This section applies only to a failure to account that arises from an act
or omission of the solicitor or associate:
<P>

(a)  for which the solicitor or associate has been convicted of a crime or an
offence involving dishonesty, or
<P>

(b)  which the Law Society Council has found to be dishonest.
<P>

(3)	A finding by the Law Society Council under subsection (2)(b) that an act or
omission is, or is not, dishonest is final and conclusive.
<P>

......"
<P>

3  	Subpoenae for production of documents were issued by the
solicitors for the Plaintiffs, seeking the production of a series of
documents
by the Law Society and by Jean Sayer, the Receiver, appointed by the Law
Society, of the practice of the late Michael Laurence
Kandy, in respect of
whose practice the claims were made.
<P>

4  	The Law Society and Jean Sayer, by Notices of Motion, seek to set
aside the respective subpoenae, having, in part, complied
with those subpoenae,
both of them leaving remaining as the basis of the motion to set aside, a
document of which production is sought,
namely the report of Miss Sayer as the
Receiver of the practice of R.B. Kandy &amp; Co.   Some of the documents
produced pursuant
to the subpoena were various items of the correspondence
which passed between Miss Sayer as Receiver and the Law Society, which included
references to the First Plaintiff, Daniel Antoine Laurent, and his various
companies.
<P>

5  	Exhibited before the court were the Minutes of the meeting of the
Fidelity Fund Management Committee on 27 July 1995, (although
without knowing
the correct date, that date may be in error) wherein a claim for $332,804.70
was disallowed on the basis that the
First Plaintiff had produced no evidence
of money being entrusted to the solicitor.  Also produced were the Minutes of a
meeting
of that Committee on 30 April 1998 in respect of a claim made by the
Plaintiffs, as well as Laurent  trading as "Affiliated Equities",
 those
Minutes disclosing that the Committee resolved that each of these claims be
disallowed, using the words, "on the basis of
no entrustment to the solicitor
in the course of his practice as a solicitor, no failure to account, and that
insufficient evidence
and documentation had been produced to enable the
claimants to establish that the solicitor was dishonest".
<P>

6  	By letter of 13 May 1998 the Manager of the Fidelity Fund advised
the solicitors for the Plaintiffs of the disallowance of the
two claims.
<P>

7  	Miss Sayer had been appointed pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act 1987</a>, on the 13th and 22nd January 1993 by this court, as Receiver of the
property of the late Michael Laurence Kandy, and of Lisa Kandy
and Gil Baron,
those three being the persons carrying on the practice of R.B. Kandy &amp;
Company.  Miss Sayer had conducted an investigation
into the practice, which
investigation is continuing.
<P>

8  	The objection made to production of the report in answer to the
subpoena as raised by the Law Society, is that the report of
Miss Sayer of the
trust property held by R.B. Kandy &amp; Company comprised seven volumes of
report and three volumes of annexures.
 The First Plaintiff's name is mentioned
only in Miss Sayer's Report No.3 at page 9, and there are scattered references
in Report
No.5 and in Report No.7 at page 24.  Neither of the other Plaintiffs
have been mentioned.  These pages have in fact been made available
to the
Plaintiffs' solicitors.  
<P>

9  	It is contended by the Law Society and Miss Sayer that the
subpoena is vexatious and oppressive, and amounts to no more than
an attempt to
trawl through these reports held by the Law Society, for no good or apparent
forensic purpose.
<P>

10  	It has been submitted on behalf of Miss Sayer, and it does not
appear to be in issue, that the late Michael Laurence Kandy
had provided
various services for investor clients, including money laundering and tax
evasion investment service, and that those
activities extended over a
considerable number of years, and that the ultimate shortfall was in excess of
twenty million dollars.
 As an integral part of that activity there was
misappropriation by the late Mr Kandy.
<P>

11  	This matter came before me initially on 26th August 1999, when a
large number of documents were produced as a result of that
hearing.  A
judgment was delivered by me on that day on the issue of costs and fees for the
production of those documents.
<P>

12  	The evidence before me on this application, from the evidence of
the first plaintiff, is that he did not recall specific discussions
over
particular transactions.  Over a period of many years a trusting relationship
had developed between the first plaintiff and
the late Mr Kandy, and as such
the first plaintiff did not question his words or figures, the relationship of
solicitor and client
having gone back to 1978.  The first plaintiff trusted the
late Mr Kandy with numerous sums of money, which resulted in numerous
conversations.  The first plaintiff does not recall specific references to
specific figures, other than that Mr Kandy did a vast
number of real estate
transactions for the first plaintiff and his companies.  
<P>

13  	The objection raised by Mr Lindsay SC on behalf of Miss Sayer is
similar to that raised by Mr Brown for the Law Society, that
this is a "fishing
expedition" and that there is no relevance to the proceedings, since the focus
of the report in dispute does not
specifically relate to the plaintiff, but
relates to other claimants and persons who have had dealings with the
solicitor.  It is
suggested that this is, in effect, a discovery.
<P>

14  	Mr Lindsay SC has referred the court to the judgment of Moffitt
P in Waind v Hill and National Employers' Mutual  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NSWLR 372</a> at 381,
wherein his Honour points out the steps annunciated by Jordon CJ as to the
procedure on subpoena, the first being by the
witness bringing the documents to
the court and handing them to the judge, who determines any objections.  The
second step is the
decision concerning the preliminary use of the documents,
which includes the question of whether or not permission should be given
for
access.  The third step is the admission into evidence of such document.
Moffitt P held at p 382:  
<P>

"It is the third step alone which presents material upon which ultimate
decision in the case rests.  In these three steps the stranger
and the parties
have different rights, and the function of the judge differs." 
<P>

15  	In Waind v Hill, Moffitt P goes on, however, to explain the way
in which a subpoena may be oppressive, if in fact it is obliging
a stranger to
carry out what may be an oppressive search, when the stranger does not
necessarily know the criteria to use in searching
for a particular document.
It could not in my view be characterised as a discovery where in fact a
specific document is sought. 
There is no oppression caused when that specific
document is known, as in fact is in the case in the present proceedings.  As
Moffitt
P said at p 382 D:
<P>

"It is a misuse of terms to say the person who inspects the latter is using it
for the purposes of discovery, because he is unaware
of the contents of the
documents or some of them."
<P>

In this case the document is known and the exercise of issuing a subpoena is
not one of discovery, and the document is properly
the subject of the
subpoena.
<P>

16  	There is no valid basis that the report may not be relevant.
"Relevant" obviously means for the very widely expressed purposes
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  Clearly methodology used in the various schemes to deal
with his clients' funds that have been adverted to in the course of these
proceedings, used by the late Mr Kandy, may assist a claimant  in searching for
evidence of a pattern of payments of funds.  The
very use of one or several
schemes to invest or misapply money could be relevant in the process of tracing
monies paid, if other
evidence can be obtained to link payments and the
procedure used by the late Mr Kandy to disburse clients' funds, properly and
improperly.
 It is irrelevant that the focus of the claim is the actual
payments made, since the additional information that is needed relating
to the
solicitors methodology will be admissible if there is evidence found in the
report of a procedure of paying monies to a particular
account, or to a
particular company, which may involve the funds of the plaintiffs or any of
them.
<P>

17  	It is proper that the reports in question be made available on
the subpoena addressed to the Law Society, being a party to
the proceedings,
since the document is the same one sought from both.  It seems to me that
although Miss Sayer is not entirely a
"stranger" to the proceedings,
nevertheless it is the party which should comply with the subpoena, rather than
Miss Sayer, and I
would propose that the motion to set aside the subpoena
against her be adjourned pending resolution of the production of the document
by the Law Society.  
<P>

18  	I propose that in the event the report is produced by the Law
Society, that the motion on Miss Sayer's behalf be granted. 
The subpoena to
the Law Society is valid, as the Law Society was the proper party from whom
production should have been sought. 
In the event of their being some further
problem with production by the Law Society then it is my view that the subpoena
addressed
to Miss Sayer may then become the proper vehicle for the production
of the report to the court.
<P>

19  	In any event, I consider that conditions should be imposed in
the making available of the report that can probably more conveniently
be
carried out by the Law Society as a party to the proceedings, which can more
readily police those conditions. 
<P>

20  	As there have been certain security concerns expressed, and
there is no opposition to conditions being imposed as expressed
by Mr Donovan
Q.C. on behalf of the plaintiffs, I would propose that any access that may be
granted be confined to the counsel and
the solicitors appearing for the parties
in the proceedings, unless the court grants leave.
<P>

21  	Further, I propose that information contained in the material
shall not be used for any purposes other than these proceedings,
or
disseminated without the leave of the court.
<P>

22  	Further, that access should be on the condition that the
Plaintiffs undertake not to approach any client or former clients
of the
solicitor without the leave of the court or the prior written approval of the
Law Society or of Miss Sayer.
<P>

23  	I would propose that the parties have liberty to apply, and
further would propose that the parties formally submit draft orders
giving
effect to the orders that I have set out above.  
<P>

24  	I would propose that the Law Society, having been unsuccessful
in these proceedings, pay the costs of the motion.  I reserve
the costs of the
motion by Miss Sayer against the plaintiffs.
<P>

25  	The orders that I make therefore are:
<P>

1.	The motion of the Law Society be dismissed.
<P>

	
<P>

2.	The motion of Miss Sayer be adjourned pending resolution of  the
proceedings.
<P>

	
<P>

3.	That the parties have liberty to apply.
<P>

	
<P>

4.	That the parties submit draft orders giving effect to the orders and
conditions I have set out above.
<P>

	
<P>

5.	The Law Society is to pay the Plaintiffs' costs of this motion.
<P>

	
<P>

6.	The costs of Miss Sayer's motion are reserved.
