<b>3575/99	CONSTANTINE KARAGEORGE v DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	In proceedings 2907/97 the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation
("DCT") sued Ann Maree Bowen to recover part of the proceeds of
the sale of a
house property ("the property") which she had co-owned with the present
plaintiff, with whom she had once lived in
a de facto relationship.  The DCT
alleged that the moneys were the plaintiff's, and that the DCT was entitled to
take them in satisfaction
of an assessment of the plaintiff to income tax ("the
assessment").  Ms Bowen denied that the moneys were the plaintiff's, and by
cross claim against both the DCT and the plaintiff sought a declaration that
the plaintiff had held his share of the property in
trust for Ms Bowen.  The
plaintiff was not, but should have been, a defendant to the DCT's claim, since
it was alleged that the moneys
were his.  When the matter was called on for
hearing, it was announced that it was settled as between the DCT and Ms Bowen;
in effect
the DCT abandoned his claim against Ms Bowen.  At that time, the
present plaintiff was seeking to file a cross claim against the
DCT for a
declaration that the assessment was invalid.  The DCT submitted that I should,
without more, refuse that application out
of hand, leaving the plaintiff to
bring fresh proceedings if he so desired, by reason that the proceedings were
otherwise settled.
 I declined to do that, on the ground that the cross claim
was closely associated with the subject matter of those proceedings and
the
plaintiff had made his application before the DCT, in effect, abandoned his
claim.  The DCT further objected to the application
to file the cross claim on
the grounds (1) that the plaintiff's proposed cross claim was bad on its face,
and (2) that he had a judgment
in the District Court at Sydney against the
plaintiff in proceedings 6808/97 based upon the assessment, which judgment
foreclosed
the plaintiff's claim to have the assessment declared invalid.  The
plaintiff, on the other hand, claims to be entitled to have the
District Court
judgment set aside.  The judgment was entered after a trial from which the
plaintiff was absent.  He says that the
cause of his absence was that he was in
prison and no warrant had been issued under s 44 of the Prisons Act 1952 for
his attendance
at Court.  He has now brought these proceedings by summons to
have the District Court proceedings removed into this Court under s
145 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act 1973</a> ("the new Act"), so that the same Court may adjudicate
upon his entitlement to have the District Court judgment set aside and whether
his cross claim for a declaration of invalidity of the assessment ought be
allowed into Court, or as the DCT submits, rejected, because
foreclosed by the
District Court judgment or because it is manifestly bad.
<P>

2   	The matters are, as appears above, closely interrelated and
it seems to me that there is a prima facie case that the District
Court
proceedings should be removed into this Court to permit them to be dealt with
simultaneously or in association with the application
to bring the cross claim.
This would be convenient, and economical for both the parties and the State.
However, the DCT objects to
this course on the ground that proceedings cannot
be removed from the District Court to this Court under s 145 after judgment.
The
question therefore arises as to whether this proposition is correct.
<P>

3   	This proposition flows from a number of decisions under or,
more accurately, <i>obiter dicta</i> relating to, the corresponding provision
in the predecessor of the new Act, namely, s 47 (1) of the District Courts Act
1912 ("the
old Act").  That section, prior to an amendment operative in 1972,
provided:
<P>

"Any plaint entered in any District Court may be removed by the writ of
certiorari into the Supreme Court by order of any judge
thereof upon such terms
as to payment of costs, giving security for the amount claimed or costs or such
other terms as such judge
thinks fit."
<P>

4   	After the amendment (effected by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>
s 7 and the Second Schedule and operative 1 July 1972) the sub section read:
<P>

"Any plaint entered in any District Court may be removed into the Supreme Court
by order of the Supreme Court upon such terms as
to payment of costs, giving
security for the amount claimed or costs or such other terms as the Supreme
Court thinks fit."
<P>

It would seem that the amendment was simply a result of the abolition by the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> of the prerogative writs and their replacement by
prerogative orders.
<P>

5   	When the new Act 1973 repealed the old Act, s 145 replaced
the old s 47.  Section 145 provides:
<P>

"(1) Proceedings may, upon the application of a party, be removed into the
Supreme Court by order of the Supreme Court upon such
terms as to payment of
costs, giving security for the amount claimed or costs, or otherwise, as the
Supreme Court thinks fit. 
<P>

(2) An action for damages in respect of personal injury or death (other than a
motor accident claim) may be so removed only if the
Supreme Court is satisfied
that the amount to be awarded to the plaintiff in the case, if successful,
would be likely to exceed $750,000
or that there is other sufficient reason for
trying the action in the Supreme Court. 
<P>

(3) A motor accident claim may be so removed only if the Supreme Court is
satisfied that the amount to be awarded to the plaintiff
in the case, if
successful, would be likely to exceed $1,000,000 and that the case involves
complex legal issues or issues of general
public importance."
<P>

Section 4(1) of the new Act<i> </i>relevantly defines "proceedings" to mean
"civil proceedings", which is in turn defined as "proceedings in the Court in
its civil jurisdiction".
<P>

6   	Mr McMillan, of counsel for the DCT, cited a number of
authorities relating to s 47 which he said support the view that proceedings
cannot be removed into the Supreme Court after judgment has been entered, but
only before judgment.  
<P>

7   	<b>Ex parte Vigilant Finance (NSW) Pty Ltd; Re Cameron
Smith</b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20NSWR%201282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] NSWR 1282</a> was a decision of the Court of Appeal under
the old s 47.  The matter was decided upon another point, but Herron CJ doubted
whether
s 47 was intended to cover cases where a default judgment had been
regularly entered (at 1284) as did Brereton J (at 1285) and Walsh
J (at 1286).
Their Honours did not set out the reasons for their doubts.  
<P>

8   	<b>Hewins v Formica Plastics Pty Ltd</b> (1968) 87 WN (Pt
1) (NSW) 469, also a decision of the Court of Appeal, dealt with a s 47
application for removal.  There it became
apparent that the injuries of a
plaintiff who had claimed $6,000 were more serious than at first thought.  The
defendant filed a
confession of the plaintiff's claim and sought to have the
Registrar enter up judgment for $6,000.  The plaintiff sought removal
to the
Supreme Court to permit him to increase his claim.  The defendant sought a writ
of mandamus to compel the Registrar to enter
judgment on the basis of the
confession. Sugerman JA would have granted mandamus and on the application for
certiorari said (at 472)
<P>

"It follows from the success of the application for mandamus that the
application for certiorari must be refused, as the matter
of the plaint will
become merged in the judgment which the registrar is ordered to enter up and
nothing will remain for the Supreme
Court to try."
<P>

Jacobs JA and Manning A-JA both considered the certiorari application first,
granted it, and therefore did not need to consider
the issue of mandamus.  
<P>

9   	Isaacs J in <b>Ex parte Sabbatini; Re Australian Iron &amp;
Steel Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2092%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 92 WN (NSW) 377</a> (at 383) considered that it was
implicit in Sugerman JA's judgment in <b>Hewins </b>that "once the judgement
had been entered the plaint merged in the judgment and certiorari would not
lie."  His Honour also took 
the view that the approach of the other Judges, in
considering the certiorari application before the mandamus application,
reflected
a view that once judgement had been entered there would have been no
plaint to remove.  In this case, after confession by the defendant,
judgment
for the plaintiff for $6,000 had been entered up in the District Court.
Although Isaacs J considered that a valid District
Court judgment would
preclude removal, His Honour held that the District Court judgment in that case
was a nullity, and ordered removal
by certiorari.
<P>

10   	In <b>Ex parte Sadler; Re Cemac Modular Constructions Pty
Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%201%20NSWLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 1 NSWLR 263</a> the Court of Appeal also appears to have considered
s 47 in its form prior to the 1972 amendment (see per Reynolds JA at 267).  The
case involved a jury verdict in the sum of $35,360.  Section 95A(2) of the
old<i> </i>Act<i> </i>provided that where there was a verdict for an amount in
excess of $10,000 in the trial of any cause in the District Court, the Court
should find and record a verdict for $10,000.  No finding or record of a
verdict for $10,000 had been made before removal was sought
pursuant to s 47.
Jacobs P (at 266) expressed serious doubt as to whether removal would be
available once a verdict had been recorded
and entered and thought that "more
probably than not, the language of s 47 envisages the removal to the Supreme
Court of a District
Court plaint for the purpose of hearing and determination
in the Supreme Court."  He went on to say that -"[t]o remove a plaint when
there had been a proper verdict thereon would be to remove it for re-hearing,
not for hearing."  Reynolds and Hutley JJA were of
the view that removal to the
Supreme Court was permissible, but refused to exercise the discretion to
remove.  Reynolds JA said (at
270):
<P>

"There may be and probably is a `plaint' within the meaning of s 47 still
subsisting, which can be the subject of an order under
that section.  It would,
however, come to this Court with the issue of liability concluded against the
defendant and a jury's verdict
as to amount standing and presently
unchallenged.  I know of no machinery in this Court to set aside that verdict
or the earlier
verdict as to liability."
<P>

Hutley JA (at 271-272) discussed the scope of the word "plaint".  He rejected a
narrow meaning confining it to the initiating process.
 He decided that the
writ of certiorari defined the scope of the meaning of "plaint".  He said (at
272) that "[w]hen the writ is
granted what must be removed into the Supreme
Court is the whole process, and where the proceeding is under way what must be
removed
is the process at the stage it has reached when the order is
served."
<P>

11   	Reference was also made to High Court cases dealing with
removal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40(1)</a> of the<i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth).  However, as that
section expressly stipulates that removal is available only "before final
judgement", these decisions are
not of assistance in the present context.
<P>

12   	Three things appear from the above.  The first is that, as
previously observed, the <i>dicta</i> on this subject in the Court of Appeal
and by Isaacs J are all <i>obiter.  </i>Secondly, they all deal with the old
Act, under which the subject matter of the removal was the "plaint" and not the
proceedings.
 The third is that the views expressed are not uniform: some
Judges were of the view that removal could occur after judgment in appropriate
circumstances.
<P>

13   	In my opinion, on its proper construction, s 145 permits
removal at any stage of the proceedings, if anything remains to be
done in
those proceedings.  It will not be appropriate, and may be impermissible, if,
after contest, judgment has been entered for
the defendant, or if a judgment
entered for the plaintiff has been fully satisfied.  But if anything remains to
be done in the proceedings,
they may be removed into the Supreme Court, if the
occasion for the exercise of the discretion is demonstrated.  This
interpretation
provides a full and flexible power which may be exercised in the
interests of the just, cheap and quick disposal of proceedings.
 In my view it
accords with the legislative intent to be derived from the words of the statute
as enacted.  It will permit, in circumstances
such as the present, the
avoidance of the agitation of the same or closely related subject matter before
two tribunals at the same
time.  I do not accept the suggestion that the
Disrtrict Court has no power to set aside the judgment: see <b>Coles v Burke
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 429.</a>  Even if that decision remains effective after the
decision of the High Court in <b>FAI General Insurance Co Ltd v Southern Cross
Exploration NL </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 268</a>, it seems to me that an express power is
conferred by DCR Part 26 r 5A.  Equally, I do not accept the suggestion,
insofar as it was
made, that the Supreme Court cannot after removal set aside a
judgment entered in the District Court; once the matter is in this
Court, the
judgment stands in a proceeding in this Court, which has power over it as in
the case of other judgments standing in this
Court.  But I am not to be taken
as expressing any view as to the basis on which an application should be dealt
with to set aside
the judgment in the District Court if removed into this
Court, or the appropriate result of such an application.
<P>

14   	I do not, therefore, accede to Mr McMillan's submission
that there is no power to remove the District Court proceedings into
this
Court.  It may flow from the views that I have already expressed in [2] that
that course would best serve the interests of justice,
by avoiding the
possibility of simultaneous although interdependent proceedings in two Courts,
and thus conducing to convenience
and economy.  However, I have said that I
should hear further submissions on whether or not the order should be made and
a time will
be appointed to hear those submissions.
