<b>	2916/98  -  LISA CAROLYN BINGHAM  v  JAN ERICA FORREST</b>
<P>

<b>	JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in respect of
the estate of the late Graham Douglas Forest who died on 14 June 1997 aged
sixty-two years.  The deceased was survived
by his widow, the defendant, his
daughter by his first marriage who is the plaintiff, and his two former wives.
Notice has been given
to his former wives who have made no claim in the
estate.
<P>

2		By his will made 19 May 1980 the deceased left the plaintiff, his daughter,
a legacy of $5,000 and he gave the residue to the
defendant and appointed her
executrix of his estate.  The deceased had a property at 7 Glover Street,
Mosman which is estimated by
the defendant to now have a value of between
$600,000 and $650,000.  She has apparently had some appraisals made by a valuer
to arrive
at this value.  There were two vans worth in total $15,000, which
have been sold.  There were some tools worth about $700 and there
was also an
interest in the estate of the deceased's father, James Murray Forrest.  That
interest was given to the deceased under
the will of his father which was made
2 February 1974. 
<P>

3		In that will he gave his property to his four children and, following upon
that, there was a deed of family arrangement which
was entered into some time
probably in 1991 under which the four children gave the deceased's widow
Charlotte Forrest, a life interest
in that property which comprised his estate,
or a subsequent property which apparently has been purchased at Werribee in the
State
of Victoria.  The property at Werribee is said to have a value of
$110,000, which would put the interest of the deceased in that
property at
$27,500, subject of course to the life estate. 
<P>

4		There was also jointly owned property held by the defendant and the
deceased, bank accounts of some $9,731.39, steers $5,084,
and there was also a
Tumut farming property of some 202 acres.  There have been a number of
estimates of value but the most recent
one, according to the one which I shall
adopt, is that the property is worth between $800 and $1,000 per acre, putting
its value
at between $160,000 to $200,000.
<P>

5		In this matter costs have necessarily been incurred.  The defendant's are
estimated at $7,500 and those of the plaintiff $15,000.
<P>

6		I will briefly refer to some of the history to set the chronology for the
matter.  The deceased was born in April 1935 and the
defendant, who is now the
widow, was born on 30 April 1947.  The deceased first married in 1960 and the
plaintiff was born on 7 July
1961.  The deceased and his wife separated and
they were divorced in March 1971.  Apparently in 1974 the deceased married
Norma Bell,
but this marriage only lasted for a few months.
<P>

7		In 1975 the deceased purchased the property 7 Glover Street, Mosman.  In
February 1977 the deceased and the defendant met and
they were married on 24
September 1977.  They then lived in rented accommodation because Glover Street
needed substantial work to
it and was not habitable.  They continued to work on
it and in July 1979 the deceased and the defendant moved in to Mosman and took
up residence.  Shortly after this, in fact in May the following year, the
deceased made his will, the provisions of which I have
broadly set out.  On 9
May 1987 the plaintiff married.
<P>

8		The deceased had been employed by the Department of Public Works as an
architect and in 1989 he changed his employment and moved
to Peddle Thorp &amp;
Walker where he again worked as an architect.
<P>

9		The plaintiff's first child, Emily, was born on 11 March 1991.  It was in
February 1989 THAT the deceased and the defendant purchased
the property at
Tumut.  That purchase price was $155,000 of which $105,000 was borrowed.  In
April 1991 that mortgage was reduced
by $20,000, presumably from a combination
of the deceased's and the defendant's savings.  The mortgage was finally
discharged in
August 1992 when the deceased obtained some access to his
superannuation fund and paid $85,000 to finally discharge the mortgage.
 The
deceased ceased work in 1992 and in 1995 the defendant retired from work.  It
had been intended by she and the deceased to move
to Tumut and to build a home
on the property and retire.  Those plans, however, were interrupted as the
deceased was diagnosed with
prostate cancer in October 1995.
<P>

10		The plaintiff's second child, David, was born on 12 June 1997 and two days
later the deceased died.
<P>

11		In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High Court has recently,
in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a>, set out the two-stage approach
that a court must take.  At p 209 it said the following:
<P>

	"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' et cetera were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co
Limited</b>.  The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process
calls for an assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate
or what, in all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance, et
cetera, appropriate for the applicant having
regard, amongst other things, to
the applicant's financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's
estate, the totality of
the relationship between the applicant and the
deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and other persons who have
legitimate
claims upon his or her bounty.
<P>

	The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

12		As directed by the High Court, it is necessary to consider the position of
the plaintiff.  She is a married lady aged thirty-seven
and has two children.
They are Emily aged eight and David aged two.  By training she is a teacher but
she has not worked recently,
mainly because she has been looking after her
young family.  Her husband has employment and apparently earns $825 per week
nett.
<P>

13		She and her husband have a number of assets.  They include superannuation
of $42,491, a car worth $24,000 and a house at 11
Richards Close, Berowra,
worth $320,000.  There is also furniture and effects, the property having an
insured value of some $65,000,
and minor amounts of cash and shares.
<P>

14		Naturally they have liabilities.  There is a mortgage which is now at
$78,000, an overdraft of $18,000, and some $2,000 in credit
cards, a total of
$98,000.
<P>

15		Given the income available to the plaintiff's family, they are managing in
a modest way.  It is apparent that they cannot do
necessary work about the home
because they do not have the appropriate funds.
<P>

16		As far as the plaintiff's health is concerned, she has in the past been
treated with anti-depressants by her GP and presently
she has problems with her
back which resulted from an injury at her employment.  She has difficulties
which mean that it would be
not possible for her to obtain physical work but no
doubt she could continue to teach or have other secretarial employment, as was
referred to in her affidavits.
<P>

17		It is necessary to consider the relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased.  It is important to realise that the plaintiff's
parents divorced in
1971 when the plaintiff was ten years of age.  The plaintiff then moved to live
with her mother.  There was contact
between the plaintiff and the deceased
after the separation and, although the plaintiff was critical of some of that
contact, it
is apparent from the evidence of the defendant that even at the
time when the defendant met the deceased in 1977 there had seemed
to be
reasonable contact between the plaintiff and the deceased, the plaintiff
visiting, coming for meals and matters of that nature.
<P>

18		According to the defendant, it started to decrease after some years and
probably initially started by the plaintiff growing
up and having more
commitments in relation to her work and the finishing of her schooling.  The
plaintiff has spoken in her affidavit
of events which transpired later on in
the eighties.  At that stage she was about to be married and she approached her
father one
day to speak to him with a view to introducing her fiance, whom the
deceased had not met.  The visit by the plaintiff was rebuffed
by the deceased
and she did not introduce her fiance.
<P>

19		She was married in 1987 and sent her father an invitation to the wedding
but received no response.  Thereafter the plaintiff
appears to have, in the
absence of further contact from her father, decided not to make further contact
because she did not want
any further rejection.  It appears that there was some
approach by the deceased through his sister to see the plaintiff's daughter
but
the plaintiff apparently indicated that the deceased would have to make the
first move.  Clearly the relationship between the
deceased and the plaintiff is
something that has troubled the plaintiff and she sought advice in relation to
it.
<P>

20		It is important to realise that in this case the defendant does not suggest
any disentitling conduct due to the absence of contact
between the plaintiff
and the deceased and in my view, although perhaps the plaintiff was of an age
where she may have been able
to persevere with contact, I certainly would not
reduce her claim by reason of the fact that there was not the contact.
<P>

21		It is important for the plaintiff to realise that the claim is not
increased or enhanced because of her father's apparent rejection
or indeed
because of the difficulties resulting from his marriage to the plaintiff's
mother.  Obviously chances to help the plaintiff
have passed.
<P>

22		The way in which the plaintiff says she has been left without adequate and
proper provision for her maintenance, education and
advancement in life has
been set out in her affidavits.  As far as education is concerned the plaintiff
clearly could return to teaching
but wishes to perhaps have part-time
employment and would like to get some secretarial skills.  She points to a
range of courses
that are available with costs between $3,000 and $6,000.
<P>

23		She also points to a number of matters concerning her house and the repairs
and improvements that are needed.  Apparently the
yard is unfenced and this is
becoming necessary because of the ages of her children.  The cost of turf and
fences to the yard is
in the area of $6,000.  Because of their limited
resources when married a rumpus room was not provided and the plaintiff would
like
to see this provided and the cost for that is said to be $62,000.  It is
not something which would be essential but no doubt is something
which the
plaintiff desires.  There is also apparently a problem with drainage with the
house and the cost to fix this is somewhere
between $10,000 and $11,000 and it
is a matter which should be attended to, as is termite protection at a cost of
some $5,000.
<P>

24		Other areas identified by the plaintiff are the possibility of having an
exercise pool to help with her daughter Emily's asthma
and her own exercise at
$15,000 and private schooling for her children of some $6,000 per annum for
each child.  The plaintiff herself
did not seem to be provided with this by the
deceased.
<P>

25		I have no doubt that some of these, particularly the urgent repairs, are
matters which would in an ordinary case lead one to
the view that the plaintiff
has been left without adequate and proper provision.  It is necessary, however,
to consider the position
of other people having claims on the bounty of the
deceased.  In this case there is only one, the defendant.  She is fifty-two,
single
and has no dependants.  She has not worked since 1995 and cannot at the
moment because of a medical problem.  She apparently has
secretarial skills and
presently exists on a pension paid by the State Government which amounts to
$503.85 per fortnight.
<P>

26		Her assets are of course the home which she lives in at 7 Glover Street,
Mosman and the likely amount from the sale next spring
of the land at Tumut.
That would realise after expenses somewhere between $150,000 and $190,000.  The
defendant has recently, because
she has had to sell the other cars and has
spent those funds on the house, purchased a VW Golf for $29,000 and to do that
she borrowed
$30,000 and she will have to repay this once Tumut is sold.  This
means that the amount available to her would be between $120,000
and $160,000.
The defendant spoke of work needing to be done to Glover Street and it would
seem the property has not been painted
since 1979. 
<P>

27		There is also of course the interest in the deceased's estate and the
defendant has 1,000 shares in Telstra worth $7,600.
<P>

28		As far as the relationship with the deceased is concerned, it is clear it
was a good one and a happy one.  The deceased contracted
cancer in October 1995
and the defendant gave up her work so that she could care for him in the
difficult time that followed.
<P>

29		An important matter in the present case in considering the extent of the
various claims is the estate and how it was built up.
 It will be apparent from
the chronology I have referred to earlier that the property at Glover Street
was purchased in December
1975.  The purchase price was $45,700 and there was a
mortgage of $20,000 to the Bank of New South Wales.  It could not be occupied
as the lean-to section at the rear of the house which had a kitchen, bathroom
and laundry had to be demolished.  At the time the
defendant and the deceased
were married the deceased had savings of $18,000 and this was used on the
repair and improvements to Glover
Street.  The work progressed partly by
contract but also physical work both by the deceased and the defendant.  The
parties from
July 1997 had apparently combined their earnings and paid all of
their outgoings from the combined earnings.
<P>

30		Also in 1979 the defendant received a legacy of some $5,000 which also went
into the renovations of Glover Street.  As I have
mentioned, it was in February
1989 that the Tumut property was purchased, with the mortgage to which I have
referred.  In part that
mortgage has been repaid by contributions from the
superannuation of the deceased.  One can see from the history that the deceased
and the defendant virtually contributed their incomes and their endeavours and
by the substantial investment of the defendant's superannuation
this enabled
the two properties, by the time of the death of the deceased, to be free of any
encumbrance.
<P>

31		There are tables which have been prepared by the defendant in which she
sets out for the period from 1982 to 1997, excluding
1989, the various nett
incomes of the parties.  The deceased's total income over the period was some
$306,172 and that of the defendant,
after allowing an appropriate amount for
1985 and 1986, was in the order of $195,209.  The deceased's amount also
included amounts
that he was paid out in superannuation.
<P>

32		One therefore has the situation where the defendant herself contributed a
sum of some $18,000 and a legacy of $5,000, which
in those days was quite a
considerable amount.  She has also with the deceased contributed substantially
her salary to their endeavours
and therefore it is perfectly clear to me that
there has been a substantial contribution to the house and to the land at Tumut
by
the defendant.
<P>

33		When one comes to consider the claim, clearly the plaintiff is an eligible
person.  She is in modest circumstances and only
received under the will the
legacy of $5,000.  I have no doubt that her needs are real.  The only question
is whether the estate
can accommodate those needs.
<P>

34		Though a slightly different question, the question of what provision is
normally made in respect of widows has been set out
in many cases and recently
the President of the Court of Appeal in <b>Goloski &amp; Anor v Goloski</b>,
unreported, 5 October 1993, summarised them in the following terms:
<P>

	"In testing the Master's decision it is appropriate to keep in mind the
principles which governed the approach which he was obliged
to take to the
widow's application under the Act.  Relevantly, these included:
<P>

	(a)	Proper respect was to be paid for the right of testamentary disposition
which is the fundamental premise upon which the provisions
of the Act are
based.  That premise requires the Court, out of respect for the continuing
right of testamentary disposition, to limit
its disturbance of the testator's
will to that which is necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act, and not
more.  See <b>The Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith and St
Charles Seminary, Perth v Scales</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20107%20CLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 107 CLR 9</a>, 19; <b>White v Barron
&amp; Anor</b>, above, 458; <b>Hunter</b>, above, 576;
<P>

	(b)	The purpose of the jurisdiction is not the correction of the hurt feelings
or sense of wrong of the competing claimants upon
the estate of the testator.
The Court is obliged simply to respond to the application of the eligible
person who was a member of
the testator's household and to consider whether, as
claimed, the provision made by the will is inadequate for that person's proper
maintenance and advancement in life.  See <b>Hayward v Fisher</b>, Court of
Appeal, unreported, 26 April 1995; (1985) NSWJB 81.
<P>

	(c)	Consideration of other cases must be conducted with circumspection because
of the inescapable detail of the factual circumstances
of each case.  It is in
the detail that the answer to the proper application of the Act is to be
discovered.  No hard and fast rules
can be adopted.  Nevertheless, it had been
said that in the absence of special circumstances it will normally be the duty
of a testator
to ensure that a spouse (or spouse equivalent) is provided with a
place to live appropriate to that which he or she has become accustomed
to.  To
the extent that the assets available to the deceased will permit such a course,
it is normally appropriate that the spouse
(or spouse equivalent) should be
provided, as well, with a fund to meet unforeseen contingencies; see
<b>Luciano</b> (above) 69-70;
<P>

	(d)	A mere right of residence will usually be an unsatisfactory method of
providing for a spouse's accommodation to fulfil the
foregoing normal
presupposition.  This is because a spouse may be compelled by sickness, age,
urgent supervening necessity or otherwise,
with good reason, to leave the
residence.  The spouse provided and will then be left without the kind of
protection which is normally
expected will be provided by a testator who is
both wise and just.  See <b>Moore v Moore</b>, Court of Appeal, unreported, 16
May 1984, per Hutley JA;
<P>

	(e)	Considering what is 'proper' and by inference what is 'improper' as a
provision in a will, it is appropriate to take into account
all of the
circumstances of the case including such matters as the nature and quality of
the relationship between the testator and
the claimant; the character and
conduct of the claimant; the present and reasonably anticipated future needs of
the claimant; the
size and nature of the estate and of any relevant
dispositions which may have reduced the estate available for distribution
according
to the will; the nature and relative strengths of the competing
claims of testamentary recognition; and any contributions of the
claimant to
the property or to the welfare of the deceased.  See <b>Re Fulop Deceased</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 679 (SC)</a>; <b>Churton v Christian &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR
241 (CA)</a> 252."
<P>

35		In talking of the need to provide a house and a sum for contingencies the
President is clearly referring to <b>Wellman</b> and passages in <b>Luciano v
Rosenblum</b> and other cases.  As was pointed out by the Court of Appeal in
<b>Elliott v Elliott</b>, unreported, 29 April 1986, such a type of provision
only applies where it can be said there has been a long and happy marriage and
a widow has helped build up the estate of the deceased.
<P>

36		If one looks at the situation of the defendant, she presently has the home
in Mosman.  Although it is in an error in which real
estate prices are high, it
is in fact the home that she has worked in and lived in with the deceased for
over twenty-one years. 
It has many fond memories for her and she is in an area
where she knows her neighbours and surrounds.  It is not unreasonable that
she
should be allowed to consider that as her home.
<P>

37		When one looks at her income it is less than $250 per week.  The total last
year was $13,017.27.  Expenses just simply for things
like rates and
electricity and utilities of that type come to in excess of $7,000.  She still
has to provide herself with food and
all the other necessaries of life.  She is
finding difficulty in doing so and that is not surprising, given the very
modest circumstances
provided to her by the pension.  It is likely that she
will get another $120,000 to $160,000, some of which will go on necessary
repairs to Glover Street.  There is no reason why she should not be able to do
these.
<P>

38		As indicated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal it is appropriate that
as well as being provided with a house the widow
have some fund for
contingencies and also a sufficient fund to provide her with income.
<P>

39		The defendant's income is not sufficient and there is no reason why one
would think that the type of provisions suggested as
appropriate for a widow
should not apply in this case.  Importantly, there have been the contributions
to build up the estate of
the deceased.  In the present case there is no
suggestion that the plaintiff has contributed to building up this estate.
There was
a long and happy marriage and in my view it is not appropriate that
any further provision be made in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

40		There is one matter which I raise and I have not referred to and that
concerns the interest in the estate of the late James
Murray Forrest.  The
defendant made the claim that she considers that that is something which she
would be quite happy for the plaintiff
to have.  There is an interest in the
remainder which no doubt will fall before too much longer.  Accordingly, given
that the defendant
is happy for the plaintiff to have this, it might be
appropriate to make an order that she receive a legacy in this regard.
<P>

41		Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff receive a further legacy of the
deceased's interest in the estate of the late James
Murray Forrest as modified
by the Deed of Arrangement made between the beneficiaries of that estate and
the widow of the late James
Murray Forrest, Charlotte Jessie Forrest.
<P>

42		I have heard further submissions in respect of costs.  The plaintiff
suggests that there perhaps should be an order in the plaintiff's
favour for
costs but in my view that is not appropriate.  Clearly just because she is an
eligible person she is not entitled to an
order for costs.  There was also at
least on the defendant's side a genuine offer to transfer some property to the
plaintiff, which
was not accepted. 
<P>

43		Ultimately the result is that the plaintiff has been unsuccessful.  She had
had the opportunity to assess the claim.  The affidavits,
once they were put
on, clearly indicated the nature of the estate.  It seems to me that it is
appropriate that from some time after
that the plaintiff ought to pay the
defendant's costs.  In order to allow a reasonable time for that assessment
being made, I will
allow some time after the supply of affidavits.  I will also
note that the plaintiff appears to have an emotional difficulty with
her
relationship with her father which becomes evident in the affidavits.
<P>

44		What I propose to order is that the plaintiff shall pay the defendant's
costs from 1 January 1999 to date. 
<P>

45		The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
