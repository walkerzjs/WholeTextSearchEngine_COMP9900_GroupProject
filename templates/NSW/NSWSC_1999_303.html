10203/99	<b>DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS   v   JOHN EDWARD HEAGNEY &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter the plaintiff, Director of Public Prosecutions,
seeks the following orders:
<P>

	<i>"1.	A declaration that the First Defendant erred in law on 23 October 1998
at Burwood Local Court in ordering a permanent stay of
seven informations laid
by the Plaintiff against the Second Defendant alleging three counts of furious
driving causing bodily harm
contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, one count
of dangerous driving contrary to s 4(1) of the Traffic Act 1909, one count of
negligent driving contrary to s 4(1) of
the Traffic Act 1909, one count of
furnishing false particulars contrary to s 8(5) of the Traffic Act 1909 and one
count of unlicensed
driving contrary to s 6(1)(a) of the Traffic Act 1909 (`the
subject informations').</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	An order setting aside the First Defendant's order of 23 October 1998
that the subject informations be permanently stayed.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	An order pursuant to s 134 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> that the subject
informations be heard and determined according to law in the Local
Court."</i>
<P>

2	In the summons a further order was sought to restrain the first defendant,
the magistrate whose decision is here under challenge,
from hearing the
matters, but that further order was not pursued.
<P>

3	The first defendant filed a submitting appearance, but the second defendant,
for whom Mr Wendler of counsel appeared, has resisted
the declaration and
orders sought.
<P>

4	It is necessary to refer to the relevant facts in some detail.
<P>

5	The second defendant was arrested on 12 September 1997, and on 24 September
1997 he appeared before the Local Court at Bankstown
where he was charged with
a number of offences.  Of particular relevance for present purposes were two
charges arising out of events
that allegedly occurred at Bankstown on 12
September 1997.  I identify these charges from the charge sheets annexed to the
affidavit
of Stephen Irvin filed in support of the summons:
<P>

6	(i)	<u>Stealing from the person: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 94</a> of the </u><cite><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></cite>
<P>

This offence was expressed as follows:
<P>

	<i>"That [the second defendant] on the 12th day of September 1997, at
Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did steal money and
property
namely, a black leather handbag containing a brown leather purse, a black
leather card holder, one Croatian passport, one
Commonwealth Bank Visa card,
one Commonwealth Bank Keycard, one Medicare card, various makeup, one pair of
sunglasses, personal papers,
three gold rings, one gold necklace, and $226.90
cash, the property of Fatima Hadziahmetovic from the said Fatima
Hadziahmetovic."</i>
<P>

7	(ii)	<u>Steal motor car: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s154.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 154(aa)(1)</a></u>:
<P>

This offence was expressed as follows:
<P>

	<i>"That [the second defendant] on the 12th day of September 1997, at
Chullora, in the State of New South Wales, did steal a motor vehicle,
to wit, a
maroon coloured 1996 model Ford Falcon sedan registered number QNA542 the
property of City Ford, Chullora."</i>
<P>

8	When he appeared in the Bankstown Local Court on 24 September 1997, the
second defendant pleaded guilty to the above offences
and the magistrate was
asked to consider a statement of facts identified in Annexure C to Mr Irvin's
affidavit.  It is desirable
that I record these facts in full:
<P>

	<i>"About 12:56 pm on Friday 12th September, 1997 vehicle QNA524 was being
detailed at City Ford - 204 Hume Highway, Chullora.  The vehicle
was unattended
with the ignition keys inside the vehicle.  At this time the vehicle was stolen
from this location.  About 5.30 pm
on Friday 12th September, 1997 the victim,
Fatima Hadziahmetovic, was walking in the carpark of the Stacey Street, Mall -
South Terrace,
Bankstown.  At this time the defendant and one other
unidentified person drove behind the victim in vehicle QNA524.  The defendant
then lent from the rear passenger side window of this vehicle and grabbed the
victims handbag from her right shoulder.  The defendant
pulled the handbag from
the victims shoulder.  As this was happening the passenger side of the vehicle
has collided with the victims
right calf causing her to spin and stumble
forward.  The offenders then drove off in a easterly direction along South
Terrace.  The
vehicle was seen by Police a short time later at the intersection
of South Terrace and Punchbowl Road, Punchbowl.  The vehicle was
then pursued
by Police through a number of suburbs.  The vehicle was eventually stopped
after a collision with another vehicle. 
The occupants of the stolen vehicle
then ran.  The defendant was arrested outside 13 Queensborough Road, Croydon
Park after a short
foot pursuit.  The defendant was conveyed to Campsie Police
Station.  The stolen vehicle was also conveyed to Campsie Police Station
and in
this vehicle was the victim's property.  The defendant was interviewed
regarding these matters and made full admissions to
stealing the victims
handbag.  The defendant stated he had been picked up at Bankstown in the stolen
vehicle at 5.30 pm this date.
 The defendant stated that at the time of being
carried in the vehicle he was aware that it was stolen."</i>
<P>

9	The second defendant was convicted on the above and other offences and was
sentenced to nineteen months imprisonment with a minimum
term of seven months.
It became necessary to return to the Local Court at Bankstown to correct an
error as to the commencement date
of the minimum term fixed, but it is
unnecessary for present purposes to record the detail of that correction.
<P>

10	The prosecution subsequently laid seven informations in March 1998 in the
Local Court at Burwood, and these are the informations
referred to in the
summons and detailed in paragraph 1 of that summons which I set out earlier.
Each of those seven informations
alleged the commission by the second defendant
of a further offence on 12 September 1997, and six of those informations
related to
offences containing as an essential element that the second
defendant was the driver of the vehicle at the relevant time.  The vehicle
in
question was the vehicle QNA524 described in the statement of facts tendered in
the Local Court at Bankstown in 1997.  The seventh
of the informations alleged
that the second defendant gave false particulars contrary to s 8 of the
<i>Traffic Act</i>.
<P>

11	When the matters came before the Local Court at Burwood on 17 September
1998, it was submitted on behalf of the second defendant
that the proceedings
should be stayed because of what had occurred at the Local Court at Bankstown
in September 1997.  That application
proved to be successful and on 23 October
1998 the learned magistrate ordered that proceedings on all seven informations
be permanently
stayed.
<P>

12	The reasons for the magistrate's decision form an annexure to Mr Irvin's
affidavit.  I do not propose to record them fully but
to record what was said
as to the basis for the application made and the ultimate conclusion
expressed:
<P>

	<i>"It is the application of the defendant to have those matters stayed
because, in his submission, to allow them to proceed would invite
a judicial
determination which is inconsistent with a judicial determination which has
already been made that he was not the driver
of the vehicle at the relevant
time...</i>
<P>

<i>	It seems to me, therefore, that to allow the present matters to continue to
be heard would be to invite a judicial determination
which is inconsistent with
a judicial determination which has already been made, and therefore I propose
to permanently stay the
proceedings which are presently before me."</i>
<P>

13	The plaintiff has submitted that the decision of the magistrate was
erroneous in law and indeed that there was jurisdictional
error warranting the
making of the orders now sought.
<P>

14	I have had the advantage of considering comprehensive written submissions
presented on behalf of the plaintiff and on behalf
of the second defendant.
Having reflected upon those submissions, I have concluded that those advanced
on behalf of the plaintiff
are to be preferred.
<P>

15	Before analysing what I perceive to be the critical features in this case,
it is appropriate to address matters of general principle.
<P>

16	Mr Wendler argued that issue estoppel applies in criminal proceedings.  The
High Court was divided over this issue in <i>The Queen v Storey</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20140%20CLR%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 140
CLR 364.</a>  Barwick CJ expressed the opinion (at 371):
<P>

	<i>"That the technical and often involved principle described as issue
estoppel has no place in the administration of the criminal law."</i>
<P>

17	Gibbs J (at 388) regarded the main objections to the application of issue
estoppel to criminal proceedings as being <i>"compelling"</i>, and Mason J (at
400-401) expressed his agreement with what Lord Hailsham had said in <i>DPP v
Humphrys</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 1</a> at 40:
<P>

	<i>"The doctrine of issue estoppel as it has been developed in civil
proceedings is not applicable to criminal proceedings."</i>
<P>

18	In <i>Storey</i> the Chief Justice and Gibbs and Mason JJ were in the
minority concerning the place of issue estoppel in the criminal law; Stephen,
Jacobs, Murphy and Aickin JJ expressed contrary opinions.
<P>

19	However <i>Rogers v The Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 251</a> tipped the balance the
other way.  In this case Mason CJ said at 254-255:
<P>

	<i>"I adhere to the view which I expressed in Reg v Storey ((1978) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=140%20CLR%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">140 CLR 364</a>
at 400-401)that the doctrine of issue estoppel as it has developed in civil
proceedings is not applicable to criminal proceedings.
 The reasons which
compel acceptance of that view are set out in the judgments of Barwick CJ,
Gibbs J and myself in that case ((1978)
140 CLR at pp 371-374, per Barwick CJ;
pp 379-389 per Gibbs J; pp 400-401, per Mason J).  The availability of res
judicata, the defences
of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict and the rule
against double jeopardy and the doctrine of abuse of process make it
unnecessary
to introduce the doctrine of issue estoppel into the criminal law.
Moreover, the introduction of issue estoppel and all its complexities
would
serve only to make the criminal law more convoluted.  This view accords with
the position reached in other common law jurisdictions
(England: Reg v
Humphrys,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 1</a>; Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] UKHL 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 529</a>; New Zealand:  Reg v Davis  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NZLR%20584" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NZLR 584</a>; Bryant v Collector
of Customs  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NZLR%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NZLR 280</a>; but cf. Duhamel v The Queen  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1984/1984scr2-555/1984scr2-555.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2 SCR 555</a>;
 <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1984/1984scr2-555/1984scr2-555.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 14 DLR (4th) 92.)</a></i>
<P>

20	In their joint judgment Deane and Gaudron JJ said at 278:
<P>

	<i>"Issue estoppel would not only overlap with the plea of autrefois acquit
and with the doctrines that have already developed, but its
importation into
the realm of criminal proceedings could well impede the development of coherent
principles which recognize and allow
for the distinct character of such
proceedings.  The preferable course, in our view, is to accept that the
principles which operate
in this area are fundamental and that the pleas and
the developed doctrines relating to the unassailable nature of acquittals and
the need for consistency may not exhaust their operation."</i>
<P>

21	The contrary opinion that issue estoppel is applicable in criminal
proceedings was expressed by Brennan J (at 266-268) and by
McHugh J (at 284),
but it seems to me that following the decision of the High Court in <i>Rogers v
The Queen</i> I should regard it as determined that issue estoppel as developed
in relation to civil proceedings is not applicable to criminal
proceedings.

<P>

22	The dicta of Mason CJ in <i>Rogers</i> set out above identify other measures
of protection however that may originate from earlier criminal proceedings.
Res judicata is
an available doctrine in criminal cases, and it finds
expression in defences of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict.  See
<i>Spencer Bower Turner and Handley on Res Judicata</i>, 3rd ed., at
310-311.
<P>

23	Autrefois acquit is available by way of a defence in bar where the essential
elements of an offence charged are the same as those
of an offence in respect
of which a conviction has already occurred.  In <i>Pearce v R</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20156%20ALR%20684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 156
ALR 684</a> Kirby J said, at 708-709 (para 103):
<P>

	<i>"In this court, although the matter is sometimes complicated by the
application of the language of criminal codes (Connolly v Meagher
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3 CLR
682</a> considering the Criminal Code (Qld) s 16; cf R v Hull (No 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%20St%20R%20Qd%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] St R Qd
53</a> per Griffith CJ (Qld)), the identity of the successive offences has
repeatedly been stated as the test (Li Wan Quai v Christie <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%201125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3 CLR 1125</a> at
1131).  The rule has been explained as requiring not identical offences as such
(Environment Protection Authority v Australian
Iron &amp; Steel Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2028%20NSWLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
28 NSWLR 502</a> at 507-8; R v Sessions  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20VR%20304" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 VR 304</a> at 309-10) but identity of
the essential elements of the offences under comparison so as to establish that
the accused has previously
been in a relevant peril of conviction.  In Li Wan
Quai v Christie, Griffith CJ said <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%201125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3 CLR 1125</a> at 1131)</i>
<P>

<i>	`In order that a previous conviction or discharge can be a bar to
subsequent proceedings, the charges must be substantially the same.
 The true
test whether such a plea is a sufficient bar in any particular case is, whether
the evidence necessary to support the second
charge would have been sufficient
to procure a legal conviction upon the first.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Thus the inquiry is not into what evidence might be given, but what must be
proved to establish the commission of each of the offences.
 The test is
therefore directed at the elements of the offences charged."</i>
<P>

24	With the above considerations of principle in mind, I return to the
circumstances of the present case.
<P>

25	It seems to me that the learned magistrate was wrong in the conclusion he
expressed and which I have recorded above.  In my opinion
there was no judicial
determination in September 1987 such as related to <i>"the driver"</i> issue
that would be central to the informations, proceedings on which have been
stayed.
<P>

26	A person who pleads guilty to an offence admits the essential elements of
the offence and no more.  In <i>The Queen v Riley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%201%20KB%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 1 KB 309</a> Hawkins J
said at 318:
<P>

	<i>"In regard to a question suggested in the case, whether a person by
pleading guilty to an indictment thereby admits the truth of the
facts stated
in the depositions, I think it right to express my opinion that he does not.
He admits simply that he is guilty of the
offence as charged in the indictment,
and nothing more."</i>
<P>

27	To the like effect in <i>Reg v O'Neill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSWLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2 NSWLR 502</a> Moffitt A-CJ
said at 588:
<P>

	<i>"...a plea of guilty, in itself, carries with it an admission of the
essential legal ingredients of the offence admitted by the plea,
and no
more."</i>
<P>

28	The magistrate sitting at Bankstown was not asked to determine any disputed
questions of fact nor did she do so.  This magistrate
did not make any finding
that the second defendant was not the driver of the stolen car at Chullora, or
at Bankstown, or at Croydon
Park.  Moreover the only relevant facts for the
purposes of the charges to which the second defendant pleaded guilty were those
essential
to the proof of the ingredients of the two offences.  Whether the
second defendant later drove the stolen vehicle at Croydon Park,
where the
seven subsequent offences were allegedly committed, was irrelevant to the
establishment of the offence charged under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 94</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></i>, and
it was also irrelevant to prove the offence charged under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s154.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 154(aa)(1)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.</i>  Moreover whether the second defendant drove the stolen car
or not was not relevant to sentence.
<P>

29	Autrefois convict was not available to the second defendant as a defence in
bar, because the elements of the offences in respect
of which he was convicted
in the proceedings at Bankstown court, and the elements of the offences to
which the later informations
related were not identical.  Those matters which
had to be proved to establish the offences first charged were altogether
different
from what had to be proved in respect of the offences to which the
later informations were directed.  Whether the second defendant
drove the
stolen vehicle was, as I observed, irrelevant to both charges upon which he had
been convicted, and it was irrelevant for
the purposes of the pleas at
Bankstown Local Court to determine who later drove the vehicle at Croydon
Park.
<P>

30	Mr Wendler submitted that even if autrefois convict was not available in
bar, the doctrine of abuse of process was broad enough
to cover the present
case and to justify the stay of proceedings ordered by the magistrate on
discretionary grounds.
<P>

31	The Local Court has power to permanently stay criminal proceedings where
such a course is required in the interests of justice:
 see <i>Smiles v
Commissioner of Taxation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/441.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 441</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2037%20FCR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 37 FCR 538</a> and <i>DPP v Shirvanian</i>

<P>

32	In <i>Smiles</i> Morling, Beaumont and Gummow JJ said (at 552):
<P>

	<i>"It is clear that, in an appropriate case, the Local Court has the power to
stay civil or criminal proceedings before it which are
an abuse of process (see
Jago [that is, Jago v District Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 23]</a> (at 25-26), per Mason
CJ; Spautz [that is, Williams v Spautz <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20174%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 174 CLR 509]</a> (at 518-521); Newby
v Moodie  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2083%20ALR%20523" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 83 ALR 523</a> at 526)...The power of a court to stay a proceeding
as an abuse of its process is an essential attribute of the exercise of the
jurisdiction
with which it is invested:  see Spautz (at 520-521)"</i>
<P>

33	In <i>Shirvanian</i>, Mason P, with whose judgment Beazley JA agreed,
expressed his agreement with the above statement of principle from
<i>Smiles</i>.  
<P>

34	What are the appropriate circumstances in which proceedings should be
restrained as amounting to an abuse of process?
<P>

35	In <i>Rogers</i> (supra) Mason CJ said (at 255):
<P>

	<i>"The concept of abuse of process is not confined to cases in which the
purpose of the moving party is to achieve some foreign or ulterior
object, in
that it is not the party's genuine purpose to obtain the relief sought in the
second proceedings.  The circumstances in
which abuse of process may arise are
extremely varied and it would be unwise to limit those circumstances to fixed
categories (Hunter
v Chief Constable [1982] AC at p 536, per Lord Diplock).
Likewise, it would be a mistake to treat the discussion in judgments of
particular circumstances as necessarily confining the concept of abuse of
process."</i>
<P>

36	Earlier, in <i>Walton v Gardiner</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 378</a> Mason CJ, Deane and
Dawson JJ said at 392-393:
<P>

	<i>"The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on
grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories
of cases in which
the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice
with fairness and impartiality may
be converted into instruments of injustice
or unfairness...</i>
<P>

<i>	...proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if,
notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise
to an estoppel, their
continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that
it is sought to litigate anew
a case which has already been disposed of by
earlier proceedings."</i>
<P>

37	In <i>Shirvanian</i> Mason P said at 135:
<P>

	<i>"Since the principle which gives rise to the power in a proper case to
grant a stay is that `the public interest in holding a trial
does not warrant
the holding of an unfair trial' (Jago (at 31), per Mason CJ), it follows that
such power resides in a magistrate
of the Local Court hearing a (summary) trial
unless excluded by clear words.  The duty to observe fairness, at least in its
procedural
sense, is a universal attribute of the judicial function.  Those
aspects of a fair trial known as the principles of natural justice
apply by
force of the common law and the presumed intent of parliament unless clearly
excluded in a particular context.  In my view,
the same can be said about the
power to prevent abuse of process as an incident of the duty to ensure a fair
trial.  And I can see
no principled ground for excluding a power to grant a
stay to prevent or nullify other categories of abuse of process."</i>
<P>

38	I do not find in the above statements of principle a cause to stay the
further proceedings against the second respondent.  I
do not consider that the
prosecution of the second defendant for the alleged offences identified in the
informations laid at the
Local Court at Burwood involved injustice or
unfairness in the relevant sense, particularly having regard to those essential
elements
of the offences alleged in such informations.  They were, as I have
already observed, altogether different from the elements of the
offences on
which the second defendant had been convicted.  Nor could it be said that the
second defendant compromised himself in
some way in respect of the later
informations by his pleas of guilty on the matters first charged.  Nor could it
be said that the
pursuit of seven further convictions for events in which the
second defendant was allegedly involved on 12 September 1997 necessarily
involved unfairness or injustice.  As Gleeson CJ said in <i>R v Dodd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991)
56 ACR 451</a> at 457:
<P>

	<i>"In Australia it is not the law that a person cannot be prosecuted for a
number of offences just because they all arise out of the
same act or the same
course of conduct."</i>
<P>

39	In his written submissions Mr Wendler argued that the informations laid at
Burwood Court involved an attempt to re-litigate the
issue of the identity of
the stolen vehicle and this warranted the permanent stay of what would be an
abuse of process.  I do not
accept that submission, and for the reasons already
expressed the issue as to who was for relevant purposes the driver of the
stolen
vehicle has not been litigated.
<P>

40	I am satisfied that the learned magistrate has erred in law in ordering a
permanent stay of proceedings on the seven informations
that have been laid.
<P>

41	Should this Court now grant the relief sought by the plaintiff?
<P>

42	The plaintiff seeks an order under s 134 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i>, and
plainly not every error of law would warrant the making of such an order.  A
succinct statement of relevant principle is to
be found in the judgment of Hunt
J in <i>Waterhouse v Gilmore</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 270</a> at 276:
<P>

	<i>"However, not every error of law justifies the grant of such relief, for
mandamus does not provide a form of general appeal upon questions
of law:
Barton v Berman  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20NSWLR%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 NSWLR 63</a> at 71.  The mistake of law must be one which
shows that the determination arrived at in the purported exercise of
jurisdiction is
nugatory and void, so that the ostensible determination by the
magistrate was not a real performance of the duty imposed by law upon
him:
(ibid at 71-72); R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Bott
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2050%20CLR%20228" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 50 CLR 228</a> at 242-243.  It must be shown that the magistrate
misunderstood the nature of the jurisdiction which he purported to exercise in
the matter before him:  Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947)
47 SR (NSW) 416</a> at 420;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=64%20WN%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">64 WN 107</a> at 109.  Jordan CJ in that case included
within the scope of mandamus the application of `a wrong and inadmissible test'
(Estate
and Trust Agencies (1927) Ltd v Singapore Improvement Trust  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%20AC%20898" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] AC
898</a> at 917) and a misunderstanding by the magistrate as to `the nature of the
opinion which [he] is to form': R v Connell <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1944/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2069%20CLR%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 69 CLR 407</a> at 432."</i>
<P>

43	I consider there was in this case an error of the kind warranting the
intervention of this Court.  There was a fundamental misapprehension
of the
jurisdiction which the learned magistrate purported to exercise so that there
was <i>"not a real performance of the duty imposed by law upon him"</i>.
<P>

44	Mr Wendler submitted that this Court should not grant the relief sought
because it is unlikely that the second defendant would
have received a greater
punishment than he has already received in respect of the convictions that have
been recorded.
<P>

45	It is not for me at this stage to determine what view a magistrate would or
should take as to penalty should the second defendant
ultimately be convicted
of the additional offences, but in rejecting this submission as I do, it
suffices that I observe that three
of the informations alleging furious driving
include as an essential element the causing of bodily harm.
<P>

46	The further argument that the stay ordered had the effect of discharging the
second defendant and that the Local Court would
have no jurisdiction to require
his return before that court is also to be rejected.  The dicta of Brennan CJ
in <i>Nicholas v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 456</a> at 467 (para 41) are directly
in point, addressing the very issue as to the effect of a stay order:
<P>

	<i>"An order staying a criminal trial is not a judicial decree conferring an
immunity from punishment for a criminal offence.  It is
not the equivalent of a
verdict and judgment of acquittal.  It confers no vested right.  A stay does
not determine the matter charged
in the indictment.  There is concededly power
to lift a stay and, if the stay be lifted, the trial on the indictment can
proceed."</i>
<P>

47	Upon the making of the orders sought in the amended summons, there is no
reason why the informations cannot be dealt with in
the Local Court according
to law.
<P>

48	The plaintiff has made good its claim to the relief sought in the amended
summons.  Accordingly I make the following declaration
and orders:
<P>

(1)	The declaration sought in para 1 thereof;
<P>

(2)	The order sought in para 2;
<P>

(3)	The order sought in para 3;
<P>

(4)	I reserve costs to afford the opportunity for the parties to make
appropriate submissions.
