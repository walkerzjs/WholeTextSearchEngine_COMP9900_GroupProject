<P>

<u>30011/1991</u>	<u>GEORGE JAMES CARROLL v POLICE MEDICAL BOARD &amp;
ORS</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This matter has had a very long and unfortunate history.  The
plaintiff was a member of the Police Force.  On 24 October 1987
he was
discharged from service as being medically unfit.  Since that time, he has been
seeking to establish what may be described
as an entitlement to a hurt on duty
pension.
<P>

2  	These proceedings were commenced in 1991.  The proceedings were
specially fixed for a hearing on 6 September 1999.  The relief
claimed by the
plaintiff is as set forth in the Third Amended Summons which was filed in court
on that day.
<P>

3  	There are five named defendants.  The court has been informed
that the first defendant may not be a legal entity and that the
second and
third defendants have adopted a submitting role to the relief now sought.
Counsel have appeared on behalf of the fourth
and fifth defendants.  The fifth
defendant was added as a party following orders made in December 1998.
<P>

4  	The evidence consists of two affidavits sworn by the plaintiff,
one affidavit sworn by his solicitor (Mr Liddy) and certain
tendered
documentation.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff joined the Police Force in 1977.  In 1979 he
suffered back injury in a motor vehicle accident.  Since that time,
there has
been a history of back problems.  There have been other incidents in which
injury has been sustained (including back injury).
 His back problems caused
him to have time off from work.  Largely, he ceased performing police duties in
1985.  By 1986 his specialist
had expressed the opinion that he should be
discharged from the Police Force on the ground of disability.  Later in 1986,
he suffered
an emotional break-down when his wife left him.
<P>

6  	He was seen by Dr Tarrant.  Initially, Dr Tarrant formed the view
that the plaintiff was suffering from a personality disorder.
 After seeing the
plaintiff on other occasions, he retracted that view.
<P>

7  	On 11 December 1986, the plaintiff was first examined by the
Police Medical Board (PMB).  PMB took the view that it was not
satisfied that
he was permanently incapable of discharging the duties of his office.
Following further back problems, a further application
was made to PMB.  He
received correspondence from the Police Department which said that the
Department had accepted his back condition
as being a hurt on duty injury and
told him that his medical discharge would take effect on 24 October 1987.  He
appeared before
doctors Swain and Orr.  Apparently they took the view that
there were not sufficient orthopaedic grounds to consider him permanently
unfit
to perform the duties of his office.  A psychiatric assessment was recommended.
He attended upon Dr Pasfield.  On 27 July 1987,
a certificate was issued.
There was a finding that he was suffering from a personality disorder.  PMB
certified that his infirmity
of body or mind rendered him permanently incapable
of discharging the duties of his office.  Thereafter, the Acting Police
Commissioner
decided that the infirmity "personality disorder" was not caused
by an injury on duty.
<P>

8  	An appeal against the decision of the Acting Police Commissioner
was brought in the Compensation Court.  The appeal was unsuccessful.
 In
December 1989 it was dismissed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
<P>

9  	Since the making of these decisions, it appears that further
material has become available to the plaintiff which reinforces
the view that
his incapacity is due to his back condition.
<P>

10  	After these proceedings were commenced in 1991, steps were then
taken for the resolving of the problem by non-curial measures.
 The solicitors
for the plaintiff wrote to the State Authorities Superannuation Board (the
Board) seeking a review of the PMB decision.
<P>

11  	By letter dated 18 October 1991, the Board responded to that
plea for assistance.  The letter contained inter alia the following:-
<P>

"The Board takes the view that it should assist your client as to the procedure
available to him so as to prevent him suffering
any injustice because the
Police Medical Board no longer has relevant functions, those having been vested
in the State Authorities
Superannuation Board.
<P>

It seems that if the events which have occurred had all occurred subsequently
to 1st April 1988 when the new Board first received
its powers, if it was felt
that an error might have been made in the decision reached under section
10B(1), Police Regulation (Superannuation)
Act, when the applicant for the
certificate was a member of the Police Force, it would be open to the Board to
reconsider the matter
if the now ex-member of the Police Force made an
application under subsection (2) of section 10B.  The position would be the
same
if the medical condition of the ex-member had substantially changed since
his examination for a certificate under section 10B(1).
<P>

Section 10B(1) is thus open to be used by the Board for a reconsideration of
the ex-member's position, provided that the former
member notified the
Commissioner of Police before his resignation or retirement and within six
months of receiving the injury which
has caused his infirmity of body or mind,
of that injury.  Now the notification has to be in a prescribed form, but this
was not
the position at the time your client claims he received his injury.
Fundamentally therefore, the question on reconsideration would
be was your
client at the time of his resignation or retirement incapable from infirmity of
body or mind of discharging the duties
of his office?  Your client would appear
to claim that his incapacity was orthopaedic, and a result of being hurt on
duty, whereas
the Police Medical Board decided that the incapacity was an
infirmity of mind.
<P>

It may be that the words in section 10B(2), namely, `resigned or retired' in
their ordinary meaning would not cover your client,
but lest there by any doubt
about this section 10, which is the operative section, defines `retired' to
include discharged under
sections 7 or 14.  Your client was discharged under
section 14.  If this is the present position, the fact that your client made
his original application under the Act prior to the amendments which commenced
on 1st April 1988 would not seem to deprive him of
his rights under section
10B(2).
<P>

Under these circumstances it appears that your client has a right to make an
application under section 10B(2) and it is open to
the present Board to
consider it;  if the Board's decision is against your client he would have a
right of appeal to the Industrial
Commission.
<P>

On the other hand I do not think that the Board has any power to reconsider
this matter under section 10B(1) because it is not given
power to reconsider
the decisions of the Police Medical Board given before 1st April 1988, and
there might be an argument as to whether
it has power to reconsider its own
decisions, although I think it can.
<P>

Further, it would appear that a section 10B(1) certificate would not be of much
use to your client now, because he has already been
discharged, whereas a
section 10B(2) certificate would, if your client is right in his claim, remedy
the situation."
<P>

It appears that this communication was based on advice received from senior
counsel.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff took up this invitation and brought an Application
for Certificate of Incapacity.  The application was dealt
with by the Police
Superannuation Advisory Committee (PSAC).  The Board had delegated its
functions under s 10B to PSAC.  It seems
that on 16 December 1992 PSAC gave a
certificate in terms of s 10B (2). It certified that he was incapable and
specified the infirmity
as "spinal injury to the lower back".  This appears to
have been a fresh determination (as opposed to a review of what had been done
by PMB).
<P>

13  	An application was then made to the Police Commissioner for a
Hurt On Duty Certificate.  For some years, it declined to issue
a certificate.
It has been said that this course was taken on the basis of a view that PSAC
did not have power to review a decision
of PMB and no jurisdiction to make any
determination in the case of the plaintiff.
<P>

14  	It appears that there was some further delay whilst the parties
abided the result of two other cases in this Court.  The first
was <u>Barnes v
Commissioner of Police</u>.  The second was <u>Smith v Police Medical
Board</u>.  Unfortunately, the decisions delivered in those cases were not of
great assistance in resolving the present problem.
<P>

15  	In December 1998, there was a change of stance by the Police
Commissioner.  By then he had adopted the view that he was not
entitled to
question the validity of the certificate of PSAC and a delegate certified
pursuant to s 10B (3) (a) that the specified
infirmity had been caused by the
plaintiff being hurt on duty.
<P>

16  	The fifth defendant has refused to act on the certificates.  The
stance taken by it is expressed in Exhibit 1.  The certificate
of PSAC (its own
delegate) is regarded as being ineffective and there is said to be an
impediment to payment of pension to the plaintiff.
 During the hearing, its
counsel expressed the view that the plaintiff needs to go back to PMB as it is
the only body empowered under
legislation to make the certification in this
case.  This change of stance has been taken it is said because of discovery in
about
1993 of error in the position previously adopted by the Board (due to the
overlooking of certain savings and transitional provisions
which had the effect
of depriving PSAC of jurisdiction).
<P>

17  	As all attempts at non-curial resolution have failed, the
plaintiff has returned to court to prosecute these 1991 proceedings.
 The
hearing took place on 6 September 1999.
<P>

18  	The fourth and fifth defendants present as being sympathetic to
the plaintiff, but draw attention to what they say may be legal
difficulties
obstructing a successful result in the present proceedings.  Both contend that
an avenue to relief remains open to him
(to go back to PMB).
<P>

19  	At this stage, it is convenient to refer briefly to some aspects
of the relevant legislation.  For present purposes, it is
not necessary to look
to the detail of that legislation and the changes made thereto.
<P>

20  	At the time of his discharge, the <u>Police Regulation
(Superannuation) Act</u> 1906 (the 1906 Act) was in force.  Police Officers
were members of the Police Superannuation Fund which was controlled by the
Police
Superannuation Board.  PMB was established under this Act.  It then had
functions in relation to the granting of an annual superannuation
allowance
under s 10B.  For present purposes, broadly speaking s 10B imposed two
requirements which had to be met to enable the granting
of an annual
superannuation allowance.  Firstly, there had to be a certificate from PMB to
the effect that PMB (having regard to
medical advice on the condition and
fitness for employment of a member) had certified the member to be incapable,
from a specified
infirmity of body or mind, of discharging the duties of his
office.  Secondly, there had to be a favourable decision from the Commissioner
of Police (he was required to decide whether or not the infirmity to which the
certificate related was caused by the member being
hurt on duty).
<P>

21  	The <u>Superannuation Administration Act</u> 1987 came into
force on 1 April 1988.  It constituted the Board which was charged with the
function of administering and managing
certain superannuation schemes,
(including the function conferred or imposed by or under the 1906 Act).  The
functions of PMB under
s 10B were given to the Board (see The Police Regulation
(Superannuation) Amendment Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)).  The 1987 Act contains
certain savings and transitional provisions (s 4).  They provide that the
amendments made by the Act inter alia to s 10B do not apply
to or in respect of
a member who inter alia retired or was discharged before the commencement of
those amendments (1 April 1988).
<P>

22  	The plaintiff asks the court to set aside the PMB certificate.
This will only be of assistance to the plaintiff should he wish
to make further
application to PMB.  The plaintiff has not shown much enthusiasm for pursuing
that possible avenue.  It may be that
further application can still be made
without the existing certificate being set aside.  I have reservations as to
whether or not
there is presently material before the court which would justify
the setting aside of that certificate.  In any event, it is not
necessary to
further consider that matter and I put it aside for present purposes.
<P>

23  	It seems to be common ground that the fourth defendant does not
have any locus standi to challenge the PSAC certificate and
it does not purport
to do so.  It takes the stance that it has performed the only function imposed
upon it by the legislation.
<P>

24  	The fifth defendant has placed itself in an invidious position.
The relevant decision was made by its delegate.  Apart from
protesting its
concern about the effectiveness of the certificate of its own delegate, the
fifth defendant has not taken any steps
to either disturb the decision or have
the certificate set aside.  Although it brings no Cross-claim in these
proceedings and has
made no other claim for relief, it continues to refuse to
make payment of the pension to the plaintiff.
<P>

25  	It may be added that the fifth defendant has a power to
compromise or settle any claim made against it (s 25).  Despite its
protestations of willingness to assist the plaintiff, it does not appear that
there has been any attempt to exercise this power.
I observe that it has
persisted with its approach to the problem, in circumstances where it had
already satisfied itself as to the
plaintiff's incapacity and infirmity.  An
exercise of the power may have produced an expeditious resolution of the
problem.
<P>

26  	The question of want of jurisdiction has been the product of
divergent views over the years.  There has been erosion of the
distinction
between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors.  Whilst these matters
have not been fully argued, my attention
has been drawn to authority for the
view that as the law presently stands official administrative decisions are
presumed to be lawful,
unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction
declares them unlawful (de Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell Judicial Review of
Administrative
Action Fifth Edition 5 - 048 and the cases cited therein).  It
does not seem to be in dispute that this authority correctly states
the present
position.
<P>

27  	The cases suggest that the presumption prevails in the absence
of rebuttal and that it cannot be rebutted except by a party
to legal
proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction who has locus standi to
challenge its status.  Further, they suggest that
administrative decisions,
however wrong they may be (including however lacking in jurisdiction they may
be) subsist and remain fully
effective unless and until they are set aside by a
court of competent jurisdiction.  Also, they suggest that the court has a
discretion
to refuse to set them aside (even where the decision is regarded as
ultra vires).  See inter alia <u>Hoffman - La Roche &amp; Co A G &amp; Ors v
Secretary of State for Trade &amp; Industry</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20AC%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) AC 295</a>;  <u>R v Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers</u> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1986/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] EWCA Civ 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20QB%20815" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) QB 815</a> at 840.
<P>

28  	The question of the locus standi of the fifth defendant was a
matter that was really not addressed.  The fifth defendant did
not put any
argument to the effect that the presumption had been rebutted.  Largely, it
simply brought the court's attention to the
savings and transitional
provisions.
<P>

29  	However, for completeness, it may be helpful if I do add some
further comment.  If a submission of rebuttal had been made,
the particular
circumstances of this case would have led me to the view that it be
rejected.
<P>

30  	Declaratory relief is discretionary.  If the court had been
asked to declare the decision to be unlawful, the court would have
been
required to look at the circumstances of this case and have regard to what
would best serve the interests of justice.  Apart
from questions relevant to
the parties themselves, there are also considerations of administrative
inconvenience.  The relevant considerations
in this case would have led to the
view that the application be refused.
<P>

31  	In the present case, there was an assumption of jurisdiction by
a delegate of the fifth defendant which is a body that has
been empowered since
1988 to make decisions of the nature contemplated by s 10B.  The subject
decision was made as long ago as 1992.
 The plaintiff's application for the
decision was made at the invitation of the fifth defendant, and he acted on the
representation
that it had the jurisdiction to entertain the application.  The
decision has been acted upon by both the plaintiff and the fourth
defendant.
It has remained on foot for about seven years.  There has been no action taken
to disturb it or have it declared unlawful.
<P>

32  	If the decision was set aside, the plaintiff would be left in
the position where he would probably have to start again.  He
has already
suffered many years of hardship.  It may be, that he would have to return to
PMB and seek a favourable decision.  This
body may have to be reconstituted for
that purpose.  This would occasion further delay and expense (including expense
to taxpayers).
<P>

33  	There would be a lack of utility in setting aside the decision.
There appears to be no real dispute that because of his back
problems (the
specified infirmity) the plaintiff is incapable of discharging the duties of
his office.  There is no suggestion of
non-jurisdictional error.  The fifth
defendant presents as being ready to pay the pension if what it sees as the
legal problems are
overcome.
<P>

34  	The plaintiff is the only party claiming relief in these
proceedings.  He seeks to have the decision declared to be a lawful
one.
Whilst the decision subsists and remains effective, the granting of such relief
will resolve the present difficulties.
<P>

35  	In the circumstances of this case, I consider that the court
should exercise its discretion to declare that the decision is
a lawful one and
I propose to make the appropriate declaration.  It may be that this is a case
where Short Minutes should be prepared
in consultation by the parties to enable
the framing of relief which will set up the mechanism which enables the parties
to give
effect to a state of affairs where the plaintiff is granted the annual
superannuation allowance.
<P>

36  	There remains the question of costs.  It is not a question that
has been addressed in argument.  It may be a question of some
complexity which
can be resolved between the parties.  Without having had the benefit of
argument, my preliminary view would be that
the fifth defendant should at least
bear part of the costs.
