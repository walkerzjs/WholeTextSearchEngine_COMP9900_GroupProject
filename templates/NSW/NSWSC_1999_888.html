<b>JUDGMENT	(Further list of documents - </b>
<P>

<b>service of experts reports)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By amended notice of motion filed 30 August 1999
the first defendant seeks orders pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p23" class="autolink_findacts">Part 23</a> r 3(6) of the <b>Supreme
Court Rules</b>, and that the first defendant file and serve all expert reports
upon which he proposes to rely 21 days after service of the further
verified
list of documents filed by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff file and serve
all statements and expert's reports in rely
upon which it proposes to rely
within 28 days after service of the expert's reports of the applicant.  The
first defendant relied
on two affidavits of Richard John Bain Allsop sworn 13
July 1999 and 27 August 1999.  The plaintiff relied on the affidavit of Robert
Lloyd Pritchard sworn 19 July 1999 and Francis Lemar sworn 10 February 1999.

<P>

2  	In paragraph (2) of the amended notice of motion the first
defendant seeks that orders (13), (14) and (15) made by Master Malpass
on 10
December 1998 be discharged.  Order (15) is that upon the presentation of a
certificate of assessment of the costs to the registrar
of the common law
division of the court, the costs as assessed are to be paid to the plaintiff
from the security sum by the registrar.
 Order (15) was made after a contested
application to set aside a default judgment and it was one of the terms upon
which the judgment
was set aside.  It is more appropriate that the discharge of
order (15) be dealt with by Master Malpass and it is stood over before
him for
that purpose on a date to be fixed. Default judgment has been entered against
the second defendant. 
<P>

3  	The issues raised in the pleadings in this matter have been
helpfully set out in a judgment of Bell J dated 22 April 1999 and
I have relied
upon some of these in setting them out below.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff, Pritchard Associates Pty Limited, claims an amount
of $264,185 due under a contract entered into with the first
and second
defendants who are said to have been partners in relation to the promotion of a
forestry resource development project
in the East and West Sepik province of
Papua New Guinea.  The plaintiff alleges two agreements, the first made on 21
May 1996 on
acceptance by the defendants of the plaintiff's offer made on 18
May 1996 to provide consultancy services in connection with the
project and the
second, described as a variation of the first, made on 10 August 1996.  The
alleged variation that occurred on 8
August 1996 was that if the plaintiff
reduced the charges for total consultancy services (excluding out-of-pocket
expenses) otherwise
payable in accordance with the first agreement, to the sum
of US$250,000 for all work carried out up until 24 September 1996 with
consultancy fees accruing thereafter to be charged at the rates and on the
terms agreed in the first agreement, the defendants would
pay to the plaintiff
the balance then remaining unpaid of the said sum of US$250,000, namely
US$204,185 as to the sum of US$154,185
forthwith and as to the balance of
US$50,000 on 1 September 1996.
<P>

5  	By his amended defence filed 25 February 1999 the first defendant
denies that he was a party to any contract with the plaintiff.
 He alleges that
the plaintiff is incorrectly named.  He contends that the agreement under which
the plaintiff seeks payment was
between the plaintiff and San Kung Trading Ltd.
Further, the first defendant pleads that the original agreement was one for the
provision
of legal services made between Phillips Fox of which Robert Pritchard
was a partner and San Kung Trading Ltd.  Subsequently, after
Mr Pritchard
ceased to be a partner of Phillips Fox it is contended that the agreement was
between Mr Pritchard in his personal capacity
as a solicitor and San Kung
Trading Ltd.
<P>

6  	By paragraph (30) of the amended defence the defendant alleges
that if it is held that there was an agreement between the plaintiff
and the
first defendant (which is denied) firstly, at all material times the plaintiff
was not a solicitor or a solicitor corporation
and did not hold a currently
practising certificate;  secondly, any work carried out or services provided by
the plaintiff pursuant
to such an agreement or part thereof, constituted
general legal work within the provisions of s 48E of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act 1987</a></b> (NSW) (as amended);  thirdly, the carrying out of general legal
work by the plaintiff was prohibited by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48E</a> and fourthly, the agreement
alleged to exist between the plaintiff and the first defendant was void.
<P>

7  	In relation to any alleged August 1996 agreement the first
defendant alleges that the plaintiff has received payment of US$170,291.57.
 He
alleges that it was a term of any agreement with the plaintiff that the balance
of the amount of US$250,000 would be payable
to the plaintiff upon completion
of the work required to be carried out in relation to the forestry resource
development project
and that the work required by that project has not been
completed.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff has provided to the first defendant unverified
discovery by list of documents dated 19 February 1999.  The list
of documents
refers to documents which are contained in 9 lever arched folders.  The first
defendant has inspected the documents
contained in these folders and has agreed
that the documents contained in each folder do not need to be itemised nor
identified in
any other manner.  This part of the list of documents that
relates to those folders is adequate.
<P>

9  	The gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint is that the discovery
that has been given is inadequate in that the documents that
are relevant to an
issue in dispute have not been included in the list of documents.  The
plaintiff complained that after the first
defendant identifies documents which
have not been discovered further documents continue to be produced.  Such
documents included
timesheets completed by Ms Potts, a diary belonging to the
plaintiff which has not yet been produced, any retained agreements as
between
the plaintiff and sub-consultants and invoices.  
<P>

10  	The plaintiff submitted that there were only four issues to be
decided, firstly, who were the parties to the contract;  secondly,
what were
its terms;  thirdly, what work was to be performed and fourthly, was the work
legal work or not?  The plaintiff submitted
that firstly, it had discovered all
relevant documentation;  secondly, that to itemise all documentation would
involve time and expense.
 It would cause further delay to the plaintiff in
obtaining a hearing date to its detriment because the first defendant had no
interest
in permitting this matter to get to trial.  Thirdly, the plaintiff
submitted that the documents were relevant for the work done up
to 24 September
1996 which is in accordance with a purported agreement of 8 August 1996.
<P>

11  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p23" class="autolink_findacts">Part 23</a> r 3(6) of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> relates to
discovery and provides:
<P>

<b>"(6)	The list of documents shall:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	be divided into two parts, of which part 1 relates to documents in the
possession, custody or power of party B, and part 2 relates
to documents which
are not, but were later than 6 months prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, in the possession, custody
or power of party B;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	include a brief description by reference to nature and date (or period)
of each document or group of documents, and in the case
of a group, the number
of documents in that group;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	specify against the description of each document or group in part 2 of
the list the person (if any) in whose possession the document
or group of
documents is believed to be;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	identify any document or group of documents which is claimed to be
privileged, and specify:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	any provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.10</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> under which the
privilege is claimed to arise; or</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	the circumstances which it is claimed bring the document or group of
documents within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(c)(ii)</a> or (iii)."</b>
<P>

12  	At least two agreements have been pleaded that of 18 May 1996
and 10 August 1996 in the statement of claim.  The first defendant
denies that
there were such agreements and puts into issue whether the plaintiff breached
implied terms of the contract in that work
was not carried out promptly and
efficiently.  The first defendant also asserts that some of the work was not
reasonably required
for the purpose of the forestry resource development
project, the contract had not been completed and it was void pursuant to s 48E
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a></b> because it involved legal work.
<P>

13  	It is my view that the list of documents is inadequate.  The
diary of Mr Pritchard which is not referred to in the list of
documents is
relevant to the issues in dispute.  As Mr Pritchard did not keep timesheets
after 14 August, 1996 diary entries would
be relevant to show the nature of the
work he undertook on behalf of the defendant.  Invoices have subsequently been
located in storage
in Mr Pritchard's garage.  Accounts rendered by Phillips
Fox, Deloitte Touche, Tohmatsu and Cartier Newells were forwarded to the
first
defendant as late as 23 August 1999.  The list of documents does not comply
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p23" class="autolink_findacts">Part 23</a> of the Rules.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the schedule does not comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p23" class="autolink_findacts">Part 23</a>
r 3(6).  A statement such as "brief to counsel" is not sufficient.  The list
should be verified in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p23" class="autolink_findacts">Part 23</a> r 3(5).  The plaintiff is
required to serve a further list of documents within 21 days.  The following
orders sought in the motion
are consequential orders that follow the supply of
a further list of documents.  I make orders in accordance with paragraphs (3)
and (4) of the amended notice of motion which relate to the service of experts
reports.
<P>

14  	The first defendant unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the
inadequacy of discovery prior to filing this notice of motion.
 Costs should
follow the event.  The plaintiff is to pay the first defendant's costs of the
motion.
<P>

15  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The portion of paragraph (2) of the notice of motion which refers to
paragraph (15) of the orders of Master Malpass of 10 December
1998 is stood
over before Master Malpass on a date to be fixed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to serve a further list of documents within 21 days.  This
list is to be verified.
<P>

(3)	Orders in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of the notice of motion
filed 30 August 1999.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff is to pay the first defendant's costs of the motion.
