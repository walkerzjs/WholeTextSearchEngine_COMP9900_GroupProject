<b>JUDGMENT (Admissibility of evidence - good reputation - "<i>relevant
sector"</i>)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:   In respect of the first program, <i>"Today
Tonight" </i>(which founds the case in the 1995 action), the jury nearly nine
months ago found it to have conveyed two imputations defamatory of
the
plaintiff. Those imputations are:  
<P>

<i>(a)	that the plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with boys who were under
the age of 18 knowing them to be under the age of 18, </i>
<P>

and
<P>

<i>(b)	that the plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with a 15 year old boy who
was then under the influence of drugs which had been
given to him by the
plaintiff.</i>
<P>

2   	In respect of the second program, "<i>Witness</i>",
telecast in 1996, the jury found the following defamatory imputations to have
been carried:  
<P>

<i>(a)	that the plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old boys
having deliberately refrained from asking those boys how old
they were.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that the plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old male
prostitutes having deliberately refrained from asking them
how old they
were.</i>
<P>

3   	Those imputations were found by the jury to have been
carried by the respective programs in each of which there was reference
to the
plaintiff having been President of the Law Society of New South Wales, in one
of which there is reference to him having held
office on the Police Board and
the Council of Civil Liberties, three organisations, one would think, which
could be characterised
as being concerned with the rule of law.
<P>

4   	After the recommencement of the part-heard trial this
morning, objection was taken to the following evidence given by Mr Lyall,
himself a former President of the Law Society of New South Wales. He was asked
by Mr Donohoe Q.C.:
<P>

<i>"Q.	You are aware that these proceedings refer to broadcasts in March 1995
and in the following year 1996, in May 1996, you were aware
of that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I am.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Prior to March 1995 what was Mr Marsden's reputation in the circles in
which you moved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I thought he had a high reputation in the position as a President
and--</i>
<P>

<i>OBJECTION"</i>
<P>

5   	The question was read to the witness again and the
following answer given:
<P>

<i>"He had a high reputation in the legal profession not only as a practitioner
but also having served as a President and  his reputation
I think
developed."</i>
<P>

6   	The objection was renewed.  The structure of this trial
being without a jury lends itself to the exploration of objections
to evidence
in a way that might not be otherwise available if a jury was present. It is
desirable wherever possible to have clarified
the nature of the evidence sought
to be tendered and thus expose a basis or bases for objections to it.
<P>

7   	The defendant objects to the witness giving evidence of the
kind encompassed by both his answers. A starting point for the
exploration of
principle said to underlie the objection is paragraph 32.52 in the 9th ed of
<i>Gatley,</i> <u>Libel and Slander</u> at page 827:
<P>

<i>"<b>Whether such evidence necessary or relevant:</b></i>  <i>It has been
stated that evidence of the plaintiff's good character or reputation is, as a
rule, neither relevant nor necessary in
an action of defamation, for the law
presumes that his character is good until the contrary is proved, and he can
safely rest on
that assumption.  However, this statement has attracted comments
that the authorities cited in support are `old and unsatisfactory',
and that
the presumption is on analysis not as to good character or reputation, but as
to injury to reputation resulting from defamation.
 Even if there is a
presumption that the plaintiff is of good character, it has been pointed out
that it must be a rebuttable presumption,
and `a party is never prevented from
leading evidence to establish an issue upon which he has a rebuttable
presumption in his favour'.
 It is submitted that an accurate statement of the
law is that evidence of the plaintiff's good character or reputation is
generally
unnecessary, but no irrelevant.  However, unless rebutting a plea of
justification, its relevance would relate to damages, and the
evidence should
be directed at the plaintiff's good character or reputation, and should not
include particular instances of good
conduct.  In the absence of a plea of
justification the plaintiff cannot lead evidence as to his enhanced or
undiminished reputation
at the time of trial".</i>
<P>

8   	By reference first to the decision of the Court of Appeal
<b><i>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Limited</i> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2 NSWLR 749</a> and
particularly at pages 800 and 801C, the groundwork was laid for a submission to
the effect that evidence called by the plaintiff
as to his reputation is
limited to the sector encompassed by the defamatory imputations found by the
jury to have been conveyed.
 For present purposes I will remark that their
Honours in the judgment of the Court in<b> <i>Morosi</i></b> in those pages, as
was acknowledged by Mr Nicholas, were dealing with the then understanding of
the operation of s 13 of the Defamation
Act. The Court in <b><i>Morosi
</i></b>said (at 801):
<P>

<i>"In the context of the present case, the respondent's bad reputation was a
bad reputation for dishonesty.  This is the reputation
which the appellant's
evidence supported, and no evidence was tendered to support a reputation for
promiscuity.  Under the general
law, although only evidence of the plaintiff's
general bad reputation can be tendered by a defendant:  <b>Scott v Sampson;
Hobbs v C. T. Tingling &amp; Co. Limited, </b>`evidence of general bad
reputation must be confined to the sector of the plaintiff's character relevant
to the libel.  If the libel
charges the plaintiff with treachery, evidence that
he has a reputation for loose morals would be inadmissible in mitigation of
damages':
 Gatley on Libel and Slander, 7th ed., p. 542, par. 1318; <b>Plato
Films Ltd. V Speidel</b>.  Assuming the relevance of the respondent's
reputation, the distinction between different kinds of reputation would have
been a
relevant matter for the jury to consider".</i>
<P>

9   	More recent authority is a ruling of Hunt J in<b> <i>Bickel
v John Fairfax and Sons Limited</i> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 474</a> at 481 being the
ruling of 12 October on evidence of reputation.
<P>

10   	In effect, and quite properly so, the whole of his
Honour's ruling was relied upon in submissions, but it is interesting and
important to note that His Honour commences his ruling by referring to:
<P>

<i>"The plaintiff seeks in his case in chief to lead evidence as to his
reputation as an author or as a writer </i><cite>and as a person</cite><i>"</i>
(emphasis added).
<P>

11   	His Honour referred to the evidence sought to be lead as
follows (at 482D):
<P>

<i>"The evidence which the plaintiff now seeks to lead is, of course, distinct
from that which has already been led to establish that
the plaintiff is and was
well-known throughout Australia as an author and as a writer on a wide variety
of subjects, but with a special
interest in scientific matters.  There is no
dispute between the parties that a plaintiff is always entitled to lead
evidence as
to his position and standing in the community in order to show that
very many people who read the matter complained of would actually
know him or
know of him, such evidence being relevant to the measure of ordinary
compensatory damages".</i>
<P>

12   	The defendant had argued that such evidence, given the
presumption in favour of the plaintiff, was inadmissible until evidence
of bad
reputation had been given. 
<P>

13   	It was in that context that His Honour at 482F refers to
an earlier statement in the 7th Edition of Gatley about evidence
of the
plaintiff's good "<i>character</i>" being unnecessary.
<P>

14   	His Honour concluded (at 483E) that a party is never
prevented from leading evidence to establish an issue upon which he has
a
rebuttable presumption in his favour.  He goes on in paragraph commencing at
F:
<P>

<i>"Moreover in defamation litigation the question must arise in many cases as
to the quality of the reputation which is presumed.  A
necessary consequence of
the defendant's argument and one from which the defendant in that case did not
shrink, is that a jury is
obliged to treat a plaintiff with the highest
reputation in the relevant sector on exactly the same basis as a plaintiff with
an
indifferent reputation.  To take an example: a bishop in charge of the
church finances who is accused of embezzlement, (who may not
be widely known in
the community) must, if the defendants are correct, be treated upon  the same
basis as a mere clerk who is similarly
accused, so far as ordinary compensatory
damages are concerned.  In my view this cannot conflict with the law and I
propose to admit
the evidence of good reputation."</i>
<P>

15   	In<b> <i>Anderson v Mirror Newspapers Limited
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20735" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 735</a> his Honour cited<b> <i>Bickel</i></b> and his ruling
therein when dealing with objection taken to the admissibility of certain
evidence in relation to reputation. The
relevant extract is at 737G where His
Honour says:
<P>

<i>"The second basis suggested for the admissibility of this proposed evidence
was that it went to good reputation. Evidence of good
reputation can of course
now be led in the plaintiff's case in chief. The decision to that effect in
<b>Bickel</b> is now to be generally accepted but the law has not been altered
that the plaintiff may lead evidence upon this issue only of good
reputation in
the relevant sector. He is not entitled to give evidence of particular facts in
support of his claim to have such a
reputation. Such particularity is
permissible only in cross-examination.  That is the rule by which the defendant
is bound in relation
to evidence of bad reputation."</i>
<P>

16   	The same rule binds the plaintiff in relation to evidence
of good reputation and his Honour cites<b> <i>Hobbs v C.T. Tingling &amp; Co
Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%202%20KB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 2 KB 1</a> at 39.  There Greer LJ said:
<P>

<i>"It seems to me convenient at this stage to state certain rules of law that
have been established by the decisions.  (1) it is not
permissible for the
plaintiff to give evidence of particular facts in support of his claim to have
a good character, nor is it open
to a defendant to give evidence or to
cross-examine as to particular instances with the object of diminishing the
damages."  </i>His Lordship cited <b><i>Scott v Samson</i></b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%208%20QBD%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 8
QBD 491.</a>
<P>

17   	The two decisions of Mr Justice Hunt point to important
concepts, "<i>relevant sector"</i> and "<i>particular facts"</i>. The
authorities to which His Honour referred and to which I have made reference
having recently received consideration in the Court
of Appeal in New
Zealand,<b> <i>Television NZ v Prebble</i> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%203%20NZLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 3 NZLR 513</a> at 524 to 530
and following. 
<P>

18   	This notion of "<i>relevant sector"</i> was articulated
earlier of course in<b> <i>Plato Films v Speidel Limited &amp; Ors
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20AC%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) AC 1090</a> by Viscount Simmons at 1124 and 1125 and by Denning LJ
at 1139-40.  Lord Denning at 1140 said:
<P>

<i>"When evidence of good or bad character is given it should be directed to
that sector of a man's character which is relevant, thus
if the libel imputes
theft the relevant sector is his character for honesty not his character as a
motorist.  And so forth.  It is
for the judge to rule what is the relevant
sector."</i>
<P>

19   	The relevant sector has been identified in submissions for
the defendant as "<i>sexual propensity"</i> or "<i>behaviour" </i>of the
plaintiff. It is submitted that any reputation witness must be limited in chief
to giving evidence as to the plaintiff's reputation
in that sector. The more
so, as I understand the submissions, by reason of that which was found by the
jury constituting the plaintiff's
causes of action (the imputations) under our
legislation, in contrast to that which existed prior to it and at common law
generally.
<P>

20   	 If that is right, it adds force, in my view, to
considerations as to the artificiality of the structure of post 1974 defamation
actions in this State and adds force to the observations of Viscount Simmons at
1125 in <b><i>Speidel</i></b> where his Lordship said: 
<P>

<i>"...  a libel action is an imperfect instrument for doing justice in every
case."</i>
<P>

21   	The imperfection to which his Lordship was referring is at
risk of being elevated, by acceptance of the submissions by the
defendant, to
rendering the instrument non-existent.
<P>

22   	In the course of submissions, and in an endeavour to
ensure I clearly understood them, extreme examples were given which can
be of
some utility.  One was a reference to the well known litigation involving Mr
Andrews, an architect of national and international
prominence ([1980]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20NSWLR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 NSWLR
225).</a>  If it was said of him in a properly "<i>structured"</i> way, that is by
an imputation, that he assaulted his wife, evidence from here and abroad as to
his good reputation as an architect
would be irrelevant and thus inadmissible.
That proposition, I am of the view arguably could be correct, on the assumption
that "<i>relevant sector"</i> is confined to "<i>relationship with his
wife"</i>.
<P>

23   	Another extreme example was that if it was said of a
person that that person murdered someone, the only evidence of reputation
that
could be led for that plaintiff would be in the sector identified of that
plaintiff's respect for human life.
<P>

24   	The statement of Lord Denning as to "<i>honesty"</i> and
the "<i>motorist" </i>is perhaps the one that captures the reality of the
distinction sought to be drawn.  One could be inclined to the view that in this
litigation, arguably, it would be irrelevant to Mr Marsden's reputation as a
motorist that imputations of these kinds were published
of him.
<P>

25   	Lord Denning's example, as I have said, articulates the
principle best because of its starkness. It does not, however, nor
do the dicta
of Justice Hunt in<b> <i>Bickel</i></b><i> </i>and<b> <i>Anderson</i>,
</b>preclude evidence of the kind that has already been given, (1) because thus
far the evidence is not of particular facts in support
of the claim for
reputation and (2) it must be relevant on any view of what that word means,
particularly under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> on the issue of damages (see <b><i>Bickel
</i></b>at 482D).  This was the thrust of Mr Donohoe's submissions.
<P>

26   	It might well be that the artificial construct we now know
as an imputation, by its very terms, is confining in the sense
of sector.  But
it does not follow as a matter of principle or as a matter of logic that being
so confining, evidence is not relevant
to other components of a person's
general settled reputation.  A plaintiff is awarded damages because he was
injured in his reputation,
because he was publicly defamed (<b><i>Uren v John
Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%2d1966%29%20117%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965-1966) 117 CLR 118</a> at 150 per
Windeyer J).
<P>

27   	As I have intimated it might not be relevant to Mr
Marsden's reputation as a motorist, but given the nature of the imputations
it
could hardly be said that it is not relevant to those sectors of the
plaintiff's reputation which the defendant itself in its
broadcasts giving rise
to the causes of action publicly identified.
<P>

28   	The distinction sought to be made for the defendant
between a person's private life and public life was curious in the context
of
an action based on two telecasts of this kind which a jury has already found to
have defamed the plaintiff in the way they did.
<P>

29   	Mr Lyall's evidence that the plaintiff had a high
reputation in the position of President of the Law Society in my view is
relevant and  admissible on the question of damages, as is his evidence as to
the reputation he said the plaintiff had in the legal
profession as a
practitioner.
<P>

30   	It may well be that further consideration will have to be
given to what precisely is meant in the cases by "<i>relevant sector</i>" and
particularly "<i>relevant</i>". An unduly restrictive construction of what Hunt
J said at 737G in <b><i>Anderson</i></b> could well lead to that extreme
example which I identified above, something which I do not understand His
Honour to have had in contemplation
particularly in the light of the example
His Honour gave in relation to church finances in <b><i>Bickel</i></b> at
483.
<P>

31   	It would be an extraordinary state of affairs if the
principle sought to be relied upon by the defendant could operate to
this
effect:  that a person who is in a position to prove that over a certain number
of years that person has developed and enjoyed
a settled reputation in various
sectors of life, indeed "<i>as a person"</i>, could not lead evidence as to
that on the issue of damages by reason of some artificial constraint imposed by
the imputation found
by the jury confining the sector to a discrete or
particular one.
<P>

32   	It may well be argued in due course that the effect of the
evidence may go one way or the other but to say that it is irrelevant
is not
persuasive.  I have formed of course no views on the merits of this litigation
on the few minutes of evidence received before
the objection was taken.  It
seems to me that it must be arguable, to take this case as an example, that
because a person has held
three public offices to which I have referred, the
reputation he has established and enjoyed was that in which he was amenable to
being injured by reason of the publication of an imputation in another or
additional sector altogether.  To put it another way, how
can it be argued that
a person who has established a reputation publicly in public office could not
present a case that in that reputation
in those <i>"sectors"</i> he was injured
by reason of the publication of imputations in another "<i>sector"</i>, <i>a
fortiori </i>if the imputations, are of gravity and impute serious personal
misconduct.
<P>

33   	I will allow the evidence given by Mr Lyall.  As Hunt J
ruled in<b> <i>Bickel</i>, i</b>t can be noted that the evidence will be given
over the defendant's objection. It will be unnecessary for further objection to
be
taken unless some additional ground for objection is to be relied upon.
