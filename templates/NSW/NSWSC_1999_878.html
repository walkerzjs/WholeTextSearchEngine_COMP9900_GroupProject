Prosecutions</u></b>
<P>

<b>	</b></center>
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1    	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  In February 1998 the plaintiff
was charged with indecent assault upon his six-year-old daughter and committing
an act of indecency
with her.  It is because of the nature of the charges, and
his relationship to the complainant, that I have already ordered that
his name
not be published.  On 6 July 1998 committal proceedings in respect of those
charges were listed for hearing, but were terminated
in the plaintiff's favour
without any evidence being presented.  However, the learned magistrate declined
to award him costs, having
considered the evidence against him in the light of
the restrictions upon an order for costs imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41A(2A)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices
Act </i>1902</a>.  In this Court, the plaintiff seeks declaratory and other relief
in relation to that order.
<P>

2    	It is necessary to examine the manner in which the
proceedings were terminated, because counsel for the Director of Public
Prosecutions in this Court submitted that the magistrate had no power to make
an order for costs in any event.  When the magistrate
called the matter on 6
July 1998, the solicitor then appearing for the Director announced that his
instructions were to seek leave
to withdraw the informations.  His Worship
asked senior counsel then appearing for the plaintiff (who did not appear in
this Court)
if he objected to that course.  The transcript records that counsel
replied, "I've no objection to the charges - to the defendant
being discharged
in each case if your Worship pleases."  His Worship said that he would note
that the matters were "withdrawn and
dismissed".  Senior counsel applied for
costs, to which the solicitor for the Director responded with the argument
advanced in this
Court.  He submitted that there was no power to award costs as
the informations had been dismissed following upon their being withdrawn.
 As
he put it, "It wasn't a question of not offering evidence."
<P>

3    	The matter was stood down to later in the day for
further argument, but for some reason that part of the proceedings was not
recorded and a transcript of it is not available.  However, I have the benefit
of evidence on affidavit about what occurred.  A number
of documents were
tendered for the purpose of the argument, including material from the police
brief of evidence.  The tape recording
of the morning's proceedings was played
and it was noted that, when asked if he objected to the withdrawal of the
informations, senior
counsel for the plaintiff had said that he did not object
to his client being discharged.  It seems that his Worship interpreted
that to
mean that he agreed to the plaintiff being discharged under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41</a> of the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i> on the basis that the prosecution offered no evidence.  He
announced that he would rescind his earlier order that the informations
be
dismissed, having been withdrawn.  The solicitor for the Director then offered
no evidence and his Worship ordered that the plaintiff
be discharged.  On the
charge coversheet he crossed out his original notation, "withdrawn, dismissed",
and substituted the words
"Def. discharged".
<P>

4    	His Worship gave judgment the following day, and at
the beginning of his reasons he noted that there had been "some initial
confusion as to the status" of the proceedings but that, upon listening to the
tape recording of the exchange the previous morning,
the scope of senior
counsel's agreement about the disposition of the matter was "obvious".  That
being so, his Worship went on, the
solicitor for the Director had "quite
properly" offered no evidence and the plaintiff had been discharged.  In
paragraph two of these
reasons I have summarised the transcript of what
occurred on the morning of 6 July, and I must say that the position taken by
senior
counsel for the plaintiff at that time is not entirely clear.
Certainly, his Worship could be forgiven for having understood that
there was
consent to the withdrawal of the informations.  However that may be, there was
a misunderstanding which, it seems, was
resolved in the afternoon. 
<P>

5    	Nevertheless, the solicitor for the Director offered
no evidence only after his Worship announced that he intended to rescind
his
earlier order.  The solicitor submitted that his Worship was <i>functus
officio</i> when he made that order and marked the papers accordingly.  The
same submission was developed by counsel for the Director in this
Court, who
argued that that was the case even if his Worship had allowed the informations
to be withdrawn under a misapprehension
that senior counsel for the plaintiff
consented to that course.  That being so, his Worship had no power later to
change the order
disposing of the proceedings, or to make an order for costs.

<P>

6    	Reliance was placed upon authority that a magistrate
is <i>functus officio</i> once he or she has announced conviction and sentence
or has dismissed an information unless, for one reason or another, the
proceedings
were a nullity: <i>R v Essex Justices, Ex parte Final</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%203%20All%20ER%20924" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 3
All ER 924</a>; <i>Ex parte Kelly; Re Teece</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%2085%20WN%28NSW%29%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 85 WN(NSW) 151</a> at 158;
<i>Thomas v Bell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2042%20ACrim%20R%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 42 ACrim R 318</a> at 320-1.  Proceedings might be a
nullity if, for example, a defendant were denied natural justice.  <i>Ex parte
Kelly; Re Teece</i> was such a case.  Other cases were summarised by Yeldham J
in the passage of his judgment in <i>Thomas v Bell</i> to which I have
referred.  Counsel for the Director submitted that there was no basis upon
which the present proceedings could be
held to have been a nullity, so that the
magistrate's order permitting the informations to be withdrawn and dismissing
them was valid
and final. 
<P>

7    	It is necessary at this stage to determine the nature
of the proceedings before the magistrate.  It is clear that they were
committal
proceedings, not a summary hearing.  The charges which the plaintiff faced are
included in Table 1 to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/index.html#p9a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 9A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act</i> 1986</a>.  By
s33C(1) of that Act they would have been dealt with summarily in the Local
Court unless the Director or the plaintiff had elected
to have them dealt with
on indictment.  While there is no evidence before me directly on the point,
such an election must have been
made by at least one of them.  It was common
ground before me that the charges were listed for committal proceedings and it
was upon
that basis that his Worship approached the question of costs.
<P>

8    	The position is materially different from that which
Studdert J considered in <i>Dargin v Simpson </i>(unreported, 24 September
1990: affirmed by the Court of Appeal, unreported, 7 February 1992).  In that
case his Honour was dealing
with the regime under ss495 and 497 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</i> 1900</a> whereby certain offences were to be dealt with summarily
unless the magistrate declined to do so.  There, the question whether a
charge
should be dealt with on indictment was a matter for the discretion of the
court, not the election of the parties, so that
Studdert J concluded (at p12)
that "proceedings under s495 are not to be characterised <i>ab initio</i> as
committal proceedings...". 
<P>

9    	The power to award costs of committal proceedings in
favour of a defendant derives from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i>.  For
present purposes, it is sufficient to say that that power arises when a
magistrate makes "an order discharging a defendant
as to the information then
under inquiry": <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41A(1)(a).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 41(2)</a> provides that a magistrate must
discharge the defendant if he or she is not of the opinion that "the evidence
is capable of satisfying
a jury beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has
committed an indictable offence...".  Alternatively, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41(6)</a> provides that a
magistrate must discharge the defendant if he or she is not of the opinion that
"there is a reasonable prospect that
a jury would convict the defendant of an
indictable offence...".  In either event, the defendant is discharged "as to
the information
then under inquiry".
<P>

10    	If the magistrate were <i>functus officio</i> when
he allowed the informations to be withdrawn, there is no doubt that he had no
power to award costs.  In <i>Reg v Phipps: Ex parte Alton </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20420" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 420</a>,
a magistrate had granted leave to an informant to withdraw an information,
there being no objection by counsel for the defendant.
 The matter had been
listed for committal proceedings.  The question for the Court of Appeal was
whether the magistrate had power
to award costs to the defendant under either
of two statutory provisions conferring such a power upon "examining justices"
who had
determined "not to commit the accused for trial".  The Court held that
the magistrate did not have that power as the information
had been withdrawn.
As Lord Parker CJ put it (at 426), "I do not think that on March 7, 1962, when
the case was called on, the time
ever came when the magistrate began to inquire
into any offence".  His Lordship added (at 427), "...an application for
withdrawal
and the consent to the withdrawal is in no sense a part of an
inquiry if it be an indictable offence or a summary trial if it be
a summary
offence".  His Lordship went on (at 428) to observe that a court has a
discretion whether to allow an information to be
withdrawn, one of the factors
relevant to the exercise of that discretion being the defendant's desire to
recover costs.
<P>

11    	The Court of Appeal's decision has been applied in
this Court: <i>Lay v Cleary </i>(James J, unreported 23 February 1993) at
pp17-19.  James J held that a magistrate who permits an information to be
withdrawn cannot
order the defendant to be discharged under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i>, as he does not have the information "under inquiry" within
the meaning of subs (2) and (6) of that section.  Accordingly, there
is no
power to order costs under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41A.</a>  His Honour also concluded, after an
examination of authority in this country and in England, that a magistrate who
allows an information
to be withdrawn in summary proceedings has no power to
award costs to the defendant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s81</a> of the Act.  Clearly, the position is
otherwise when the prosecution offers no evidence, whether in committal
proceedings or at a
summary hearing.  In that event, a defendant in a summary
hearing is entitled to an order dismissing the information under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s80</a> and may
apply for costs under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s81:</a> <i>Lay v Cleary </i>at pp31-2.  Equally, a defendant
in committal proceedings is entitled to discharge under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41</a> and to seek costs
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s41a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41A.</a>  So much was recognised by Lord Parker CJ in relation to the
English procedure in <i>Phipps </i>at 428.
<P>

12    	The crucial question remains, then, whether the
magistrate in the present case was <i>functus officio</i> when he recorded that
the informations had been withdrawn and dismissed.  This is not an easy matter
to resolve.  It is true that,
when his Worship expressed his intention to deal
with the matter in that way, senior counsel for the plaintiff did not protest
that
that was not the course to which he had consented.  Nevertheless, he had
said that he had no objection to the defendant being "discharged"
and, no
doubt, he was mindful of the significance of that expression in the relevant
provisions of the Act.  Moreover, he immediately
announced his intention to
apply for costs and I cannot believe that counsel of his great experience was
unaware of the fact that
the magistrate had no power to make such an order if
the informations were withdrawn.  As I have said, there was a misunderstanding
and, in the light of what occurred when the matter was resumed in the
afternoon, it is clear that his Worship would not have allowed
the informations
to be withdrawn if he had understood that that course was objected to.
<P>

13    	Was the magistrate's earlier order, then, a nullity?
Unsurprisingly, I was not referred to any case directly on point.  What
concerns me is that his Worship made that order under a misapprehension that it
was consented to.  No doubt, if he had not been under
that misapprehension, he
would have invited senior counsel for the plaintiff to put submissions in
opposition to the informations
being withdrawn.  In the light of what happened
later, it is likely that he would then have refused leave for them to be
withdrawn
and have required the solicitor for the Director to elect whether or
not to offer evidence.  The situation is very different from
that with which
the Court of Appeal was dealing in <i>Ex parte Kelly; Re Teece </i>(supra).
Nevertheless, there is a sense in which it could be said that the plaintiff was
denied natural justice at that stage, albeit
in circumstances in which no fault
could be imputed to the learned magistrate.
<P>

14    	Before me, the parties agreed that I should
determine this question before hearing argument about the exercise of his
Worship's
discretion in refusing the order for costs.  In the circumstances, I
am not prepared to hold that the magistrate was <i>functus officio</i> when he
recorded that the informations had been withdrawn and dismissed and that,
accordingly, his later order that the plaintiff
be discharged is of no effect.
The proceedings in this Court must be determined on their merits.  While I have
the benefit of written
submissions from the parties, they should have the
opportunity to develop those in oral argument.
