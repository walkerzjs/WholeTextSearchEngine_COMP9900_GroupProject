<P>

<center><b>HANZIC v CABRAMATTA COMMUNITY CENTRE INC &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	WOOD CJ at CL:
<P>

<b>BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

2  	On 9 January 1986 the plaintiff was working as a child care
supervisor at a vacation care programme conducted by the first defendant,
the
Cabramatta Community Centre, within the premises constituting the Villawood
Public School.  Those premises were owned by the
second defendant, the State of
New South Wales, and they were used in term time as a primary school.
<P>

3  	During the vacation period, the second defendant permitted the
first defendant to use the craft room, as it was described, as
well as the
toilet facilities and such portions of the schoolyard as were needed, for its
vacational care programme.
<P>

4  	The 9th January 1986 was a wet day.  In order to keep the
children occupied arrangements were made to show them some videos.
 For that
purpose, chairs needed to be moved from an elevated stage area to the body of
the room.  In the course of setting up the
room, the plaintiff and some other
workers made their way up to and down from the stage, which stood at a height
of 860mm above the
floor of the hall, using a set of centrally located stairs.
These stairs were somewhat primitive, comprising four open steps secured
at the
top to the stage, and at the bottom to the floor of the hall.  They did not
have any handrail.  To their condition at the
time of the accident I will
return, as it is in relation to that issue that the plaintiff's claim turns.
<P>

5  	It was the plaintiff's evidence that as she was going up the
stairs, she noticed a box containing computer paper at the front
of the stage
to her right.  Fearing that someone may trip over it, she reached over, picked
it up, turned, and went to descend the
stairs.  As she did so she slipped.  She
fell to the ground, twisting her left ankle and striking her back.  Her ankle
quickly swelled
up and she was taken to hospital.  X-rays were taken, her ankle
was strapped and she was advised to see her general practitioner.
 Later she
was referred to an orthopaedic specialist.  She was placed in a short leg
plaster, and treated with physiotherapy and
analgesics.
<P>

6  	For some years afterwards she walked with the aid of a single
crutch, two crutches, or a walking stick.  As time passed she
began to
experience pain in the hip and lower back.  It would seem that this aggravation
became obvious in about mid 1988.  Eventually
she was referred to medical staff
at the Royal North Shore Pain Management Centre for further treatment.  From
about 1990 she found
that she was experiencing falls when the right leg
collapsed from under her.   These falls she attributed to pain in the back and
hip occasioned by the change in posture caused by the use of walking aids, and
by the steps that she had taken to reduce stress on
her injured left ankle.
Eventually, on 4 February 1993, while being treated at the North Shore Pain
Management Centre, she suffered
one such fall down some stairs, occurring,
according to her when her right leg gave way. In this fall she suffered a
fracture of
the malleolus in the left ankle.
<P>

7  	Upon the plaintiff's case, she developed severe disabilities as a
result of these events.  They led to multiple attempts at
treatment by a number
of medical practitioners as well as numerous hospital admissions, culminating
most recently in the implantation
of a morphine pump, designed to reduce her
pain, and thereby to take her off the considerable volume of medication that
was being
prescribed, and to increase her mobility.  The outcome of that
procedure so far has been favourable, in that the plaintiff has made
considerable progress in reducing the vast amount of weight that she put on
during the period of inactivity, in reducing her dependence
on medication, and
in improving her outlook on life.
<P>

8  	It is her case that the somewhat dramatic and extensive sequelae
of what, on face value, might have been regarded as a simple
ankle strain, were
all the direct consequence of the original accident, and are organically based.
It is the case of the defendants,
however, that the consequences outlined have
been exaggerated.  The plaintiff, they submit, has been less than genuine in
her complaints.
  Alternatively, it is submitted, if her disabilities are
genuine, then they are attributable to causes other than the original accident.
It is the defendant's case additionally, and independently of the medical
issues, that the stairs were safe, that there was no breach
of any duty of care
on their part, and that if there was any such breach of duty of care, then the
plaintiff was guilty of contributory
negligence in not maintaining "a proper
lookout".  
<P>

9  	Both defendants conceded the existence of a general duty to
exercise reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff, on the
part of the
first defendant as an occupier and employer, and on the part of the second
defendant as owner and joint occupier of the
premises.  The content of that
duty of care in relation to the steps, the occurrence of any breach, and the
presence of a causal
connection between any breach and the fall are, however,
very much in dispute.
<P>

<b>LIABILITY</b>
<P>

10  	It was the plaintiff's case that the stairs were unsafe in so
far as they were worn and slippery, in so far as the width of
the tread or
going was too short, and in so far as the tread was warped.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff gave evidence to the effect that she first
conducted a vacation care programme at the school in August/September
1984.
She was also involved in similar programmes at the school during the 1985
school holidays, leading up to the January 1986 programme.
 It was in those
circumstances that she came to be aware of the state of the stairs which she
described as having a surface that
was "very shiny", and wood that was "sort of
pitted with wear".  She noticed that when walking upon them they "tended to be
very
slippery".   She gave the following evidence in this regard:
<P>

"Q. Prior to January 1986, what had you observed about those stairs?  A. That
the stairs were very shiny, very slippery.  They were
of a rough wood, a worn
rough wood and I felt quite unsafe.  They were dangerous.
<P>

Q. What did you notice about them in relation to the children?  A. A number of
children had slipped on the stairs while using the
stairs.
<P>

Q. In 1985?  A. yes.
<P>

Q. And did you do something about reporting the condition of the stairs?  A.
Yes.
<P>

Q. What did you do?  A. I spoke to the principal of the school."
<P>

The school principal she identified as Brian Chudleigh.  That conversation was
received into evidence in relation to the second
defendant.  The plaintiff
placed the conversation as occurring in December 1984, when she went to the
school to pick up the keys.
<P>

12  	Additionally, she said that she mentioned the unsafe condition
of the stairs in the written reports that she handed to the
first defendant at
the conclusion of the various programmes that she had supervised at the school.
 These reports dealt with matters
such as the activities offered, visits of
significance, and any problems that emerged, as well as matters of financial
interest.
<P>

13  	It was accepted that written reports of this kind were provided
to the first defendant at the conclusion of the various programmes,
but they
were not produced in answer to a subpoena or calls for their production.
Unfortunately it would appear, as Ms Collie explained,
that they were destroyed
in about 1993, when the Centre was relocated.  In those circumstances, I
allowed secondary evidence to be
given of the reports, such evidence to be
confined to the plaintiff's case in relation to the first defendant.  In this
regard, the
plaintiff said:
<P>

"Q. In those reports that went into those ladies did you make any reference to
the condition of those stairs?  A. Yes I did.
<P>

Q. What was that reference?  A. I explained that the stairs were slippery, that
they were shiny, that they were pitted and as a
number of children had slipped
on the stairs, that during the time that I was supposed to run a fire drill I
could not do it because
the only access was for the children to use the stairs
and because of the dangerous condition of the stairs we would not run a fire
drill and I had to verbally do one with one of them watching what the
instructions were.
<P>

Q. Without using the Stairs?  A. Without using the stairs, yes."
<P>

14  	So far as the other falls that were seen by the plaintiff were
concerned, she said:
<P>

"A.  the first school holidays that I was there, there were a number of
children that fell down the stairs and one of the adults
also slipped on the
stairs and when I noticed how dangerous they were, that is when I made the
decision that the stair area, the
stage area, was out of bounds to the
children.
<P>

Q. And the reason for that?
<P>

A. Because of the stairs being so slippery and shiny and I was frightened that
someone would get seriously injured."
<P>

The worker who fell, she said was a girl on work experience, who slipped on the
stairs during the August/September 1984 programme.
 It was during this
programme she said that she placed the stairs out of bounds for the children,
other than some of the older children
who were allowed on the stage for
supervised activities.
<P>

15  	Additionally to the written reports, which were included in an
exercise book handed in at the conclusion of each programme,
the plaintiff said
that she spoke of her concerns to one of the social workers who came to the
Centre.  In this regard she said:
<P>

"Q. Where do you say you spoke to this person?  A. This person was at the
centre, because on this particular day they came down
to the centre,  for what
I do not recall, but the oral conversation was to the effect that I was not
running a fire drill with the
children because of the nature of the stairs and
that I had walked the kids through verbally a fire drill and this person was
there
in the room as I did it and the comment to me was that "That's okay. That
is satisfactory because I wouldn't, she wouldn't use the
stairs either."
<P>

16  	The relevance of a fire drill, in relation to these stairs,
concerned the circumstance that the windows to the room were barred,
and that
in the event of a fire commencing in the entrance area, escape could only be
achieved by going up the stairs, over the stage
and out to the playground via a
storeroom.
<P>

17  	The fall which the plaintiff experienced on 9th January, she
described in the following terms:
<P>

"Q. What happened on one occasion when you were on the stairs?  A. I had walked
up and taken down one lot of chairs. I was walking
up again and I thought I
needed to remove that box of paper because it could cause someone to trip on
it.  So I was standing on the
second step from the bottom.  I leant over and
picked up the box of paper in both hands. I turned around to go down the stairs
and
when I put my right foot forward my feet just slipped out from underneath
me.
<P>

Q. Do you recall what sort of shoes you had on?  A. I had a leather sandal
on.
<P>

Q.  When your feet slipped out from underneath you did you have any control at
all?  A. No, none whatsoever".
<P>

18  	In cross examination she gave the following evidence concerning
this event:
<P>

"Q. As I understood you yesterday, you put your right foot forward? A. yes.
<P>

Q. As you put your right foot forward your feet slipped out from underneath
you? A. yes.
<P>

Q. And you don't tell his Honour that you have any recollection of your right
foot actually touching the next stop down? A. yes,
as I put my foot onto the
bottom step, that is when it stepped on the bottom step, slipped out.
<P>

...
<P>

Q. So you are telling his Honour that you slowly and carefully picked up the
box? A. Yes.
<P>

Q. And you slowly and carefully turned? A. yes.
<P>

Q. And you slowly and carefully took your right foot off the second step? A.
yes.
<P>

Q. And started to place it down? A. yes.
<P>

Q. And you slowly and carefully put it on the next step down? A. I don't
recall. I can't recall putting my full weight on the next
step. As I went to
put it onto the next step that's when my foot slipped out from underneath.
<P>

Q. So your weight was still on the back foot? A. yes.
<P>

Q. You tell his Honour that the back foot slipped? A. I was saying that both
slipped out. I cannot recall which of the feet that
actually slipped. They both
went out from underneath me.  I can't accurately say one  (way) or the
other."
<P>

19  	Dr. Olsen, an occupational health, safety and rehabilitation
consultant, was called in the plaintiff's case.  No expert was
called by either
defendant in relation to the accident, in the case of the second defendant
because of its failure to serve any expert
reports, either in accordance with
the Supreme Court Rules, or in accordance with directions given on 14 July
1998, 14 April 1999
and 26 August 1999.  In circumstances where the matter was
subject to Differential Case Management, this was an inexcusable omission
on
its part.
<P>

20  	Dr. Olsen examined what were said to be the stairs on 21 April
1994.  He described them as comprising a set of four steps set
into the side
rails, at an angle of 37 degrees to the horizontal and of irregular step
height.  He said that subjectively the steps
seemed to be slippery, a
conclusion that was confirmed, in his opinion, by a drag and slide test which
he conducted and which produced
a coefficient of dynamic friction across the
grain of 0.28 and 0.32 along the grain.  This his said was less than an
acceptable standard
of 0.4.  He was cross examined in relation to whether his
drag and slide test used conformed with the test proposed in the Australian
Standard 366S.1 then in force.  He agreed that it did not but said that he and
other experts did not employ or agree with the method
suggested in that
Standard.
<P>

21  	Additionally it was his evidence that the tread and going of the
first and second steps were insufficient at 232mm, a distance
that fell short
of the minimum set down by the Building Code of Australia that was introduced
in 1990, and that specified in Ordinance
70, of 250mm.   The practical effect
he described as follows:
<P>

"There is lesser room to place the foot and so there would be an increased risk
of falling...".
<P>

22  	The first step he said was warped in a concave manner with a
depth of 7mm in the middle of the step.  The warp in the second
step of about
2mm he described as involving a concavity over most of its area, so that it
"curved from one edge downwards and then
back up again on the other side".
Warping was not a "good effect", which he explained thus:
<P>

"A. Depending on what part you step onto, so if you step on the part that
slopes away, then the effect of coefficient of friction
would be there, so it
becomes more slippery.  If you step on the other side, it goes up, then you may
have a reverse effect".
<P>

23  	The steps he also said were worn with deep pitting and gouging
of the front edge of each step.  There were remnants of old
paint on the inside
of the side supports and the extremities where there had been little foot
traffic.  Their slipperiness he said
could have been reduced by fitting them
with a simple adhesive non slip strip such as that of a carborundum finish, at
a cost not
exceeding $100.
<P>

24  	His evidence was of limited value so far as it was based on
observations and tests made eight years after the event, at least
in relation
to the extent to which he judged the steps to have been worn or slippery, since
he could not say whether they were in
the same condition in 1986.  His
assessment in relation to the sufficiency of the width of the tread and going
was of more significance,
assuming that the stairs in place when he examined
them, were the stairs on which the plaintiff fell.  The second defendant raised
this squarely as an issue, suggesting that the 1986 stairs were damaged by fire
in 1988 and replaced with a new set of stairs.  This
had a relevance both for
Dr. Olsen's opinion, and also for the general credibility and reliability of
those witnesses called by the
second defendant who floated, with varying
degrees of confidence, the proposition that the stairs had been relaced and
that those
seen by Dr. Olsen were not the original stairs.
<P>

25  	It so happened that three sets of photographs of the stage and
stair area were tendered.  They comprised a set of three polaroid
photographs
taken by the plaintiff immediately after the accident;  two photographs taken
after the 1988 fire,  and four photographs
taken by Dr. Olsen on 21 April
1994.
<P>

26  	To the naked eye, these photographs appear to depict the same
set of stairs, being a basic unit comprising four steps with
open risers,
without any handrails, and located in the same position.  The 1998 photos do
not suggest any evidence of damage to them.
 It is quite impossible to detect
any difference between the photographs, let alone to conceive of any reason why
a set of stairs,
apparently undamaged in the fire, would have been replaced by
a virtually identical unit.
<P>

27  	Although not calling any expert witness, the second defendant
did call two senior staff members of the Cabramatta Community
Centre, and two
former principals of the school.  The first was Ms Bamforth, who commenced work
as a Community Development Worker
located in the portable building at the
school, in October 1985.  The first vacation care program she witnessed was
that which commenced
in January 1986.  Her position she described as the first
line supervisor for the project.  
<P>

28  	Although she said that no complaint had been made to her about
the stairs, her evidence was almost valueless in that regard
since she had not
been on the site during any of the vacation periods prior to the one in which
the plaintiff was injured.  She had
no recollection of reading the reports that
admittedly were prepared in relation to the vacation care programme.  Although
she had
an impression that the stairs in the craft room were renewed, she
accepted that she had not seen any new stairs being installed.
 She agreed in
cross examination that she could not be positive that this did occur, and she
said that she had no recollection of
ever walking upon the stairs in this
room.
<P>

29  	Ms Collie held the position of Co-ordinator with the Cabramatta
Community Centre from February 1985.  Although she had no recollection
of
seeing any complaint concerning the stairs in a report from the plaintiff, her
evidence tended to assist the plaintiff's case
so far as she recalled her
"raising the issue of the stage" in May or October 1985.  The evidence she gave
in this regard was as
follows:
<P>

"Q.  What was the problem there?  A. Well, that she considered it dangerous for
the children so they were not permitted to go up
on the stage. 
<P>

Q. Did she tell you why she considered it dangerous?  A. I can't remember to be
honest. I know that I heartedly concurred with what
she said, but whether I was
because --
<P>

Q. Don't speculate? A. No I don't remember, sorry."
<P>

...
<P>

"Q. I want to ask you, specifically, on a certain topic.  I want you to pause
before you answer the question.  Have you ever, prior
to Mrs. Hanzic being
injured, ever had any complaints made to you about the state of the stairs in
the room at the vacation care
programme conducted at the Villawood Public
School?   A. I don't think so."
<P>

30  	This latter answer she explained, in cross examination, meant
that she "did not remember", an answer that fell far short of
a denial of the
making of a complaint concerning the stairs.  The earlier part of the answer
however tends to fit in with the plaintiff's
version of events.  This witness
did acknowledge that the plaintiff wrote up reports concerning the programme
and also an accident
book.  She described her as a "good reporter" and an
excellent co-ordinator.  She had no recollection of the contents of the
reports,
and was not in a position to deny that there had been a mention of
falls on the stairs.  She did not think that she had used the
stairs herself.
In those circumstances, her evidence does not advance the defendants' case at
all.
<P>

31  	Mr. Charlton was the principal of the school from late January
1986 until the end of 1989.  He was accordingly not in any position
to give
evidence as to events or conversations prior to the plaintiff's fall.   He did,
however, give evidence as to the use of the
room, and of the stage, in the
years following the event.  He was unaware of any accident over that period,
involving the stairs,
that became the subject of the accident reporting
procedure that was in place.
<P>

32  	He said that he had not experienced any difficulty himself when
using the stairs, and did not consider them to have been slippery.
 He was no
longer the principal when the fire damage to the craft room was repaired, and
he was therefore not in a position to say
whether the stairs were later
replaced.  He agreed that he was the person depicted in the post fire
photographs standing on the steps,
and also agreed that they had not been
damaged in a way preventing him from doing that.
<P>

33  	In these circumstances he does not assist the defendants' case
in relation to the replacement of the stairs, or in relation
to any matters
that preceded the plaintiff's fall.
<P>

34  	Mr. Chudleigh was the principal between 1982 and 1985.  The
stairs in the room before the plaintiff's fall he described as
made of
"weathered timber", and as being "pretty rough in nature".   Before the
erection of a partition in 1985 the hall was used
for assemblies, dance and
music and for classes.  He had no recollection of any accidents, in this area,
of a serious nature.  He
had not experienced any problem himself with the
stairs and had not found them slippery.
<P>

35  	He had no specific recollection of meeting the plaintiff, or of
any conversation with her concerning the facilities used by
the vacation car
programme.  When shown the photograph taken in 1994 of the stairs and stage, he
suggested that they differed from
the condition which he recollected in his
time as principal.  He said that they were then untreated and were the colour
of a weathered
paling fence.  He also thought that there were only three
steps.
<P>

36  	He acknowledged that he did not become aware of the plaintiff's
accident until he was spoken to, in 1990 or 1991, by the solicitors
for the
second defendant.
<P>

37  	In my view, his evidence was found wanting in so far as he had
no recollection of any work being undertaken, in his time, to
repair the
stairs, in so far as he recalled the stairs to have originally comprised three
steps, and in so far as he suggested that
the stairs in the photographs
differed in appearance from those that he recalled.  So far as I can see, the
photographs which I find
were taken in 1986, 1988 and 1994, show no such
difference.  No other witness suggested that the stairs were originally of
three
steps - a matter that would have involved a substantial increase in step
height from that measured which varied between 162mm and
170mm, to one in the
order of 215mm.
<P>

38  	I do not accept him as a reliable witness, and prefer the
evidence of the plaintiff to his wherever they are in conflict. 
The impression
which he left upon me was of a dogmatic and defensive person who was not
prepared to concede any possibility of fault
on his part, and whose
recollection of the events was less than accurate.
<P>

39  	In the circumstances, I am satisfied, upon a balance of
probabilities, that the stairs seen by Dr. Olsen were those on which
the
plaintiff fell, that the tread and going were as he described, and that the
width of the tread was inadequate.  I accept the
plaintiff's evidence that the
steps were slippery, that prior to her accident, several children and other
workers had slipped on
them, and that she drew their condition to the attention
of Mr. Chudleigh, and to the attention of employees of the first defendant,
in
the manner she described.
<P>

40  	Her evidence in this regard was challenged so far as a statement
taken by a loss investigator attributed to her the observation
that:
<P>

"A number of children have slipped on the stairs prior to my accident.  As a
result of this I prevented the kids from using the
staircase. <i>I did not
report</i> these incidents to the Cabramatta Community Centre Management
because they were not serious."
<P>

The plaintiff denied making any such comment, and it is in any event equivocal.
Even if made, it is equally capable of being understood
as a reference to not
reporting or recording in the Accident Book, individual minor accidents which
did not involve any injury to
a child.
<P>

41  	In accepting the plaintiff's evidence, I state that she
impressed me generally as a witness of the truth, who had been an active
and
responsible member of the community, and not a person whose credit was
otherwise dented.
<P>

42  	In coming to this conclusion I was also impressed by the
evidence of her co-workers, Ms Woolcock and Ms Jamieson, to the effect
that
each had seen children fall on the stairs before the plaintiff's accident.  
<P>

43  	Ms Woolcock said that she had a fall herself while going up
them, during 1985.  She gave evidence of this in the following
terms:
<P>

"Q. When you walked up and down them, what did you notice about them?  A. Well,
I actually did fall up them myself once but they
are very old stairs.  They are
worn, they are slippery.  They appeared at the time to have some sort of
lacquer on them that had
worn away in parts.  There was no railing and they are
not the - the tread is not an exact width of your foot. Like, it is very
difficult,
worse coming down than going up because they overlap the other one
at the back.
<P>

Q. What was the effect of coming down when you put your foot forward?  A. You
couldn't really put your whole foot - you had to put
your foot sideways to get
down the stairs."
<P>

To her knowledge, three children fell.  It was as a result of this she
recalled, that the plaintiff banned their use by the children.
<P>

44  	Mrs. Jamieson similarly said she saw children fall up and down
the stairs on a number of occasions during 1985.  She confirmed
that as a
consequence they were banned by the plaintiff from using them.  She described
the stairs in the following terms:
<P>

"Q. What did you notice about the stairs?  A. The stairs were very worn.  The
tread was very short.
<P>

Q. The tread being?  A. The width, the width of the step was very short;  worn
in a smooth manner that they were very slippery."
<P>

45  	Her evidence was not challenged in cross examination, nor, to
any significant extent was that of Ms. Woolcock.  Each had the
advantage of
working inside the room where the plaintiff fell, and of gaining a particular
familiarity with the state of the stairs.
 Neither had an interest to serve,
and their credit was not diminished in cross examination, either generally or
by reference to
the statements they made at the time of the plaintiff's
fall.
<P>

46  	It was submitted that the mere fact of prior falls was not of
itself probative of the stairs being slippery, or of the existence
of any
causal relationship between their condition and the plaintiff's fall.  In a
general way there is a logical attraction to such
a proposition, since the
other falls may theoretically have resulted from carelessness or skylarking on
the part of the plaintiff
or the children, or the workers involved.  There was,
however, no suggestion that there was any conduct of this sort involved - a
matter as to which the defendants bore, at least, an evidentiary onus if they
were to rely upon it as an explanation for proven falls.
 
<P>

47  	So far as the plaintiff is concerned, her evidence is that she
was acting carefully, being aware of the problem which had caused
her to place
a ban upon the children using the stairs.  That she was a careful person is
indicated by the circumstance that the very
activity she was undertaking, at
the time of the accident, was to remove a potential cause for injury.  There is
no reason to suppose
that she overbalanced as the result of turning quickly
with the box in her hands, or was otherwise inattentive for her own safety.
<P>

48  	In all these circumstances I am satisfied that the stairs were
in an unsafe state and had been so for a considerable time before
the
plaintiff's fall.  I am also satisfied that the fall occurred without any fault
or lack of care on the plaintiff's part, while
she was in the course of moving
from the second step to the first step.  The direct cause of the fall, I find,
was the worn and slippery
state of the steps, compounded by the narrow tread
width and the absence of any protective rails by means of which she could have
broken her fall.
<P>

49  	The defence of contributory negligence, based upon an alleged
failure on the plaintiff's part "to keep a proper lookout" fails.
 I turn then
to the question whether the defendants or either of them are liable in law for
this event.
<P>

50  	It is beyond argument that the first defendant was the occupier
of the craft room at the relevant time, and also the employer
of the plaintiff.
As such it owed a duty to exercise reasonable care for her safety - as an
occupier, in accordance with the principles
discussed in <u>Australian Safeway
Stores v Zaluzna</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a>;  and as an employer in accordance with
the principles discussed in <u>Kondis v State Transport Authority</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">154 CLR
672</a> at 687 and 689.  Its duty of care as an employer extended to the provision
of a safe place of work.  The plaintiff's duties required
her to use the stage
and to access it by means of a set of stairs which were unsafe.  They formed
part of her place of work.
<P>

51  	Not only were the stairs unsafe upon reasonable inspection, but
their unsafeness and the occurrence of prior falls had been
reported to the
first defendant but ignored.  In those circumstances the plaintiff has
established negligence on its part both as
an occupier and as her employer.
<P>

52  	So far as the second defendant is concerned there was no issue
as to its ownership and control of the premises, or of the fact
that it was a
dual occupier.  Counsel for this party expressly eschewed reliance upon any
principle involving a special immunity
from liability in tort for personal
injury, caused by the condition of leased premises, that may have been approved
in <u>Cavalier v Pope</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%20AC%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) AC 428</a>, a decision not followed in <u>Parker v
South Australian Housing Trust</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2041%20SASR%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 41 SASR 493.</a>  Its inconsistency with
the modern law of negligence has been accepted by the High Court in <u>Northern
Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 313.</a>  The concession was
accordingly well made.   
<P>

53  	As a dual occupier, with the degree of control over the premises
which the second defendant had, namely a right to determine
which portion of
the premises the first defendant could use, its use of them during term time,
and the acceptance of an obligation
to maintain security in relation to them,
this defendant had an independent duty to use care towards persons coming
lawfully onto
the premises.  The persons within the umbrella of that duty of
care must be taken to have included the staff of the vacation care
centre which
was permitted to use the premises, as well as the children who attended its
programmes.  The existence and extent of
its duty as a dual occupier is as
described in <u>Wheat v E Lacon &amp; Co Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1966/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20AC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) AC 552</a>, applied in
<u>Hanson v Mathews Bros Contractors Ltd </u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2055%20SASR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 55 SASR 183</a> and followed in
<u>Hawkins Construction Co Ltd v Everson Swindel</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20NZLR%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) NZLR 306.</a>
<P>

54  	The second defendant placed some reliance on the decisions of
the Court of Appeal in <u>Stannus v Graham</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20ATR%2081%2d293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) ATR 81-293</a> and <u>Morgan
v Sherton</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] NSWCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2046%20NSWLR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 46 NSWLR 141.</a>
<P>

55  	The first is a decision on its own facts so far as it turned
upon the liability of an owner/occupier for a condition of which
it was
unaware, and it is distinguishable in view of my finding that the unsafe
condition of the stairs was brought to the attention
of the school principal
before the fall, and also upon the basis that these stairs were so constructed
as to be unsafe. 
<P>

56  	The present is not a case of an unsuspected or unknown defect,
tortious liability for which would depend upon the existence
of a duty to
inspect, of the kind rejected in <u>Aslandis v Atsikados</u> and the other<u>
</u>decisions referred to in <u>Stannus</u>.
<P>

57  	The second decision is concerned with the proposition that while
a duty of care is owed by an occupier not merely to those
who are reasonable
and careful, but also to those who might fail to take proper care for their own
safety, that duty will not necessarily
extend to protect an entrant from the
risk of injury that comes with foolhardy or reckless conduct.  The present is
not such a case.
The plaintiff's conduct could not by any stretch of
imagination be described as foolhardy or reckless.
<P>

58  	The risk of a fall was, in the present case, both obvious and
foreseeable.  The problem of slipperiness could have been addressed
simply and
cheaply by the provision of an adhesive strip, or by the provision of a new set
of stairs which could have accommodated
a wider tread, consistent step heights,
handrails, and steps that were not worn, warped or slippery.  The failure of
the second defendant
to address the problem once brought to the attention of
the school principal, and its actions otherwise in providing a set of stairs
that were unsafe, constituted a breach of its duty of care.
<P>

59  	Since I am not persuaded that the fall occurred through any
fault on the part of the plaintiff, or by overbalancing on her
part, I am
satisfied that a causal connection has been established. She is entitled to a
verdict against each defendant.  Contributory
negligence has not been
established, and no occasion arises for any apportionment of liability.  As
between the defendants, agreement
has been reached as to the manner in which
they will apportion liability between themselves.  Accordingly there is no need
for me
to address the cross claims.
<P>

<b>DAMAGES</b>
<P>

60  	In a case involving such a dramatic development from a
relatively minor ligamentous ankle strain to an apparent condition of
substantial disability, it is necessary to subject the plaintiff's evidence, as
well as that of the treating or assessing medical
practitioners, to a very
close examination.
<P>

61  	That evidence needs to be considered in the light of the
following background:
<P>

(i)	On 10 February 1951 the plaintiff was born
<P>

(ii)	On 31 March 1973 the plaintiff was married
<P>

(iii)	On 29 March 1974 her first child, Bianca, was born
<P>

(iv)	On 21 October 1975 her second child, Michelle, was born
<P>

(v)	On 13 October 1977 her third child, Faith, was  born
<P>

(vi)	On 7 March 1980 her twins Alison and Karen were born
<P>

(vii)	On 6 January 1983 her fifth child, Edouard, was born.
<P>

(viii)	On 9 December 1984, the plaintiff began work as a permanent part time
pharmacy assistant, at Liverpool;
<P>

(ix)	On 9 January 1986, the fall in the craft room occurred, leading to the
plaintiff being admitted to the Auburn District Hospital
for x-rays and
strapping and follow up by her general practitioner, Dr. Zaman, who treated her
between 14 January 1986 and 1991.
<P>

<b>The Medical Evidence</b>
<P>

62  	The evidence revealed that:
<P>

(i)	On 29 January 1986 the plaintiff saw Dr. Trevitt, an orthopaedic surgeon
who reported that:
<P>

" her symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of sprain over the lateral
ligament of her left ankle but the situation is now complicated
by stiffness in
the muscles and other ligaments causing a fixed equinus deformity of the left
ankle because of the pain.  I have
arranged some physiotherapy in an effort to
improve the position of the left ankle and to try and get the patient weight
bearing
so that she can start to walk."
<P>

(ii)	On 13 February 1986 Dr. Trevitt reported:
<P>

"This patient's left ankle is certainly improving a great deal with
physiotherapy and she is now almost to the neutral position
when weight
bearing. However, her progress is becoming complicated by the severe pain and
swelling she has experienced over the last
few days with weight bearing.
<P>

I feel that she needs a below knee walking plaster in order to let the
situation settle down now and would plan on removing this
in a fortnight and
continuing with further physiotherapy subsequently."
<P>

(iii)	On 27 February 1986 Dr. Trevitt reported that he had removed the
patient's plaster and noted that her left ankle was in the
plantigrade
position.
<P>

(iv)	On 26 June 1986, Dr. Trevitt reviewed the plaintiff. Clinical examination
showed a stiff ankle gait on the left and pain at
all extremes of movement.
He noted that he had advised the plaintiff that he did not believe that further
physiotherapy or external
treatment would help the situation. He expected
further improvement over time provided that she resumed her normal life style
and
increased her daily activities.
<P>

(v)	On 30 June 1986 the plaintiff saw <u>Dr. Deter Giblin</u>, an orthopaedic
surgeon, on referral from Dr. Zaman.  At that time she was complaining of pain
`all around the ankle' and was using
a single crutch.
<P>

(vi)	On 8 July, 22 July and 12 August 1986, the plaintiff was again seen by Dr.
Giblin who noted that while blood tests were clear,
as was the stress x-ray,
which he carried out on 8 July, the bone scan showed increased uptake in the
left ankle suggestive of arthritis.
<P>

(vii)	On 7 September 1987, she was reported by Dr. Giblin as still having
persisting symptoms.
<P>

(viii) On 15 December 1987, tomograms were performed and reported as normal.
<P>

(ix) On  14 January 1988, Dr. Giblin reported that her left ankle was still
sore, and he noted that she was on a crutch.  She was
found to be tender in the
antero-lateral aspect of the ankle joint which was stable;  there was no
obvious muscle wasting.  Dr. Giblin
opined:
<P>

"I feel that she has genuine soft tissue symptoms in her ankle reasonably
causally related to the alleged accident.
<P>

Her symptoms will probably persist for an indeterminate period of time, she
will be unfit for her pre-injury job during this period
which may last for a
year or more.
<P>

She would be fit for a sedentary sit down position where she did not have to
stand or walk.  The longer term outlook is unclear
although she would probably
be more prone to arthritic changes in the ankle."
<P>

(x)  During the period 1986 to 1988, the plaintiff underwent various courses of
physiotherapy and acupuncture, with little relief
from the former but with some
relief from the latter.
<P>

(xi) On 6 September 1988, the plaintiff was seen by Dr. Graham Mahony, who
reported:
<P>

"The above patient gave a history of sustaining an injury to the left ankle and
from the records available it appears she could
have sustained an injury to the
lateral ligament of her left ankle.  It is consistent that the fall she
described could have produced
such a lesion.
<P>

She subsequently has complained of back pain and pain in the right hip and the
pain could be associated with a low lumbar back strain
as well as generalised
strain on the right hip which could be related to altered posture.  There does
appear to be some over reaction,
however in regard to the left ankle although
it is  reasonable that she does have some persisting discomfort.  I do feel she
could
benefit from further investigations and treatment and I would consider
her fit for activities not involving significant weight bearing."
<P>

This appears to have been the first medical record taken of hip and back pain;
it fits in with the evidence of the emergence of
significant back symptoms by
about 1988.
<P>

(xii) On 9 September 1998, the plaintiff was seen by Dr. Grady for assessment
of her mental and emotional state.  At that stage
he was unable to reach a firm
psychiatric diagnosis upon the information available, and without an
orthopaedic opinion that showed
her complaints and disability to be
commensurate with the injury suffered.  He did, however, record a history of
pain in the right
hip, and of strained marital relationships attributable to
her problems and her difficulties with sexual intercourse due to pain.
<P>

(xiii) Dr. Cunningham saw the plaintiff on 17 November, 1998, and similarly
recorded a history of pain in the left ankle, right
hip and lumbar spine.  He
was of the opinion:
<P>

"This patient has sustained a severe strain of the left ankle as a result of a
fall at work nearly three years ago. A reflex sympathetic
dystrophy has
developed effecting (sic) this ankle.
<P>

This condition is very difficult to treat and shows a very poor response to any
type of treatment.
<P>

The patient remains unfit to return to work and is only fit for a sedentary job
where transport is not a problem.
<P>

The long term prognosis must be guarded."
<P>

(xiv) On 5 January 1990, the plaintiff also saw Dr. Slater, an ankle
specialist, upon referral from Dr. Cross.  He referred her
to Dr. Ted Morgan,
apparently with a diagnosis of sympathetic reflex dystrophy in the ankle.
<P>

(xv) On 24 January 1990, the plaintiff saw Dr. Ted Morgan, a pain management
consultant, for the first time at the Royal North Shore
Pain Management Centre
(`the Pain Clinic').  His impression was one of:
<P>

"right L5/S1 facet joint derangement consequent upon the basic leg limp
inequality and the effect of bearing weight preferentially
on the right leg
when there was pain in the left ankle.  The impression therefore is of:
<P>

(1) Chronic entrapment of perforating cutaneous branches of the sural
communicating nerve above the right lateral malleolus.
<P>

(2)	Mild sympathetic dystrophy
<P>

(3)	L5/S1 facet joint dysfunction causing right leg pain."
<P>

(xvi) Over the ensuing year Dr. Morgan  injected the right L5/S1 facet joint
and the sural communicating nerve entrapment sites,
with temporary relief.
<P>

63  	(xvii) On 18 January 1991, the plaintiff was first seen by
Professor Michael Cousins, the head of the Department of Anaesthesia
and Pain
Management at Royal North Shore Hospital, when she was admitted to that
hospital with a two week history of severe pain
in the low back.  A diagnosis
of myofacial pain with acute muscle spasms of the lumbar paravertebral muscles
was made, and treatment
was provided by placement of an epidural catheter
through which epidural fentanyl and marcaine were administered.  Physiotherapy
was also provided.  
<P>

(xviii) The plaintiff's history thereafter, as Professor Cousins noted in his
report of 17 August 1994, was one of repeated admissions
to the North Shore
Hospital or the Pain Clinic, following acute episodes of pain, back spasm, and
falls, of review by a number of
specialists for investigation of possible
organic causes for her complaints, and of adjustment of her medication. 
<P>

(xix)  On 15 February 1991, the plaintiff was first seen by Dr. Dallas, who
thereafter assumed responsibility to "top up various
medications prescribed by
the Pain Clinic, and to co-ordinate management external to the hospital
system".  In his first report he
noted that the prognosis was very difficult to
assess, and that the various treatment groups in the Centre were unsure of the
final
outcome.  In his subsequent report, dated 15 November 1999, he confirmed
that the plaintiff had been consistently on "high doses
of anti-depressants,
anti-inflammatory medication and analgesics" for the persistent pain for which
she had been treated.  The left
ankle sprain and subsequent fracture, he said,
caused a sympathetic dystrophy to develop.  The long term results he again
noted were
"hard to predict."
<P>

64  	(xx) On 17 February 1991, the plaintiff was admitted to the Pain
Clinic under the care of Dr. Schwarzer.  During this admission
a history was
taken of severe exacerbation of back pain, as well as of pain in the right leg,
left ankle and right hip, of spasms,
and of falls.  The plaintiff undertook the
pain management programme as an in-patient until 16 March 1991, with some
progress being
reported both in terms of pain reduction and increased activity
level.  Advice was given to her regarding posture, relaxation, management
of
household duties, restrictions on manual work, exercise, the need to pace
herself and to pass on some of her domestic responsibility
to others, and the
like.  She was supplied with a TENS machine for her lower back.  She was
reported as having participated well
in the programme and to have displayed a
"very determined attitude".  At the time of her admission she had presented as
a "very depressed,
very anxious and overweight woman who was very tearful", but
by the time of her discharge she was assessed as falling within the
normal
range on the depression scales.
<P>

(xxi) Dr. Zaman reported, consistently with the position recorded so far, that
by 1991, the plaintiff had changed from the "very
pleasant, happy, outgoing
person" he had previously known, to a "tense, edgy, aggressive and impatient
person".  These changes he
said were noticeable from August 1987, by which time
she was beginning to have problems with her marriage.  Again, this accords with
her evidence as to her frustration with the pain and inability to do the things
expected of a wife.
<P>

(xxii) In November 1991, the plaintiff was readmitted to Royal North Shore
Hospital, for administration of intramuscular morphine,
following an acute
episode.
<P>

(xxiii) On 26 February 1992, the plaintiff was reviewed at the Pain Clinic, it
being noted that she had been experiencing further
acute episodes of muscle
spasm that had required hospitalisation, and that she was still suffering
episodes of the right leg `giving
way' when the pain became severe.  The
problem was assessed to be one of continuing muscle spasm.
<P>

(xxiv) In May and August 1992 the plaintiff was referred for urological and
gastro-enterological investigation following the report
of symptoms in these
areas.
<P>

(xxc) From August 1992 she resumed physiotherapy as an out patient at the Pain
Clinic, attending twice weekly.
<P>

(xxvi) In December 1992, she was hospitalised for sixteen days for further
treatment, after a severe episode of back pain, during
which period she
received an epidural morphine infusion.
<P>

(xxvii) On 17 January 1993, she was readmitted to the Pain Clinic, where she
remained until 13 February 1993, for a further attempt
to control her pain.
Unfortunately during this admission, on 4 February 1993, she fell down some
stairs when her leg gave way.  As
a result of this fall she suffered a crack
fracture of the tip of the lateral malleolus and an avulsion fracture of the
tip of the
medial malleolus, again in the left ankle.
<P>

(xxvii) The return to the use of crutches, as a consequence of this fall, was
reported as having aggravated  her posture and worsened
her back pain.  She was
eventually discharged with advice as to weight reduction, and marital
counselling, and on a variety of medications
including Tegretol, Adolat,
Tryptanol, Panadol and Pepcidine.  She was reported as presenting initially as
"a very angry middle aged
woman whose daily functioning had suffered as a
result of her chronic pain", and as being discharged in a state of
disappointment
for the reason that, as the result of her further fall and ankle
injury, she had not made the gains hoped for.
<P>

(xxix) On 22 March 1993, the plaster fitted to her lower left leg was removed.
When reviewed on the next day at the Clinic it was
noted that she had made
little progress, and that her back pain had been aggravated by poor posture and
an inability to do her exercises
as a consequence of the leg plaster.  She was
noted to be displaying `signs of stress and depression' which were `known
amplifiers
of pain'.
<P>

(xxx) As a result of the further fall, the plaintiff was referred to Dr. Sears
for neurological testing without any abnormality
being found.  She was also
reviewed by Dr. Wegman for gastric reflux and dyspepsia, in case they were a
product of her medication.
<P>

(xxxi) On 13 October 1993, the plaintiff was readmitted to Royal North Shore
Hospital with several muscle spasms in the low back
which were relieved by
intravenous Diazapam.  Mexilthene treatment was also begun.
<P>

(xxxii) Dr. Jane Trinca, who treated her on this occasion, noted the presence
of marked spinal muscle spasm, and of some sensory
disturbances.
<P>

(xxxiv) Because of her complaints of pain in the right hip she was referred, at
the time, to Dr. Ruff, for orthopaedic opinion.
 Xrays were normal.
<P>

(xxxiii) On 18 November 1993, panendoscopy was carried out which revealed minor
gastritis to be present, along with a small hiatus
hernia, and an area of
superficial ulceration in the oesophagus.  This was treated with Losec.
<P>

(xxxv) On 9 December 1993, the plaintiff reported problems of palpitation and
dizziness with the mexilthene, and it was progressively
replaced with increased
doses of Epilim.
<P>

(xxxvi) On 3 January 1994, the plaintiff was readmitted to Royal North Shore
Hospital because of further episodes of pain and giving
way of her legs.  An
MRI of her brain and cervical region were carried out and found to be normal.
Dr. Williamson, a consultant neurologist,
examined her and reported that her
signs and symptoms were not consistent with organic neurological disease.
<P>

65  	By August/September 1994, at which time it appears to have to
have been assumed that her claim for damages might be ready for
trial, several
of the treating doctors reviewed the plaintiff and crystallised their opinions
in various reports that were tendered.
 
<P>

66  	So it was that, on 1 September 1994, Dr. Slater provided a
diagnosis of "chronic left ankle and foot pain (post traumatic)
complicated by
pain dysfunction syndrome".  He did not think the prognosis for improvement to
be good, and thought that she would
be likely to have "ongoing intermittent
symptoms".
<P>

67  	Dr. Mahoney, in a report dated 2 September 1994, stated:
<P>

"Mrs Hanzic does appear to have developed symptoms referable to a cervical
strain, a low lumbar back strain as well as a generalised
strain of the right
hip, although a degree of right hip pain could be referred from her back.  She
also has had symptoms referable
to a generalised strain of the left ankle and
has sustained a further injury which has involved an avulsion fracture of the
tip of
the medial malleolus and an undisplaced transverse fracture of the
lateral malleolus.
<P>

She has developed arthritic changes in her left ankle which appear to be post
traumatic, and I would consider in view of the history
to be influenced by the
initial incident in January 1986, and the subsequent incident in January
1993.
<P>

She will require further treatment and I would consider that the arthritic
changes in the left ankle will accelerate and it is very
likely that surgical
treatment will ultimately be indicated.
<P>

As far as her neck, back and right hip is concerned, I would consider that the
pain be associated with altered posture and she will
require further treatment
in the form of physiotherapy to these regions."
<P>

68  	Dr. Giblin, in a report also dated 2 September 1994, opined:
<P>

"This lady's condition has now stabilised.
<P>

She has developed sympathetic reflex dystrophy affecting her left lower limb.

<P>

The pain in the back and the pain in the interscapular area, is an age related
phenomenon which is being materially aggravated by
her altered gait pattern.
<P>

It is my opinion that surgical intervention would not be beneficial on her
spine or her leg or ankle.
<P>

It is my opinion that she remains permanently incapacitated for her pre injury
job.  As such, it is my opinion that she has fifteen
per cent permanent
impairment of her back, and 20 per cent permanent loss of efficient use of her
right leg below the knee and 5
per cent permanent loss of efficient of her
right leg at or above the knee.
<P>

Anxiety, apprehension, and depression, are supra imposed additive inorganic
factors."
<P>

69  	Professor Cousins in a report dated 17 August 1994, provided the
following summary of the plaintiff's condition:
<P>

"It appears that Mrs. Hanzic initially suffered a sprained left ankle and
subsequently developed postural abnormalities in the low
back region which
resulted in a recurrent `myofacial' pain syndrome in the low back region which
eventually extended into the scapular
region.  This condition has been
associated with depression and substantial anxiety which appear to have
contributed to her recurrent
episodes of severe muscle spasm necessitating
hospital admission.  No organic basis has been found for her episodes of
falling and
dropping things.  Care has been taken to modify her dosages of
medication and if she has adhered to these regimens, this would not
appear to
be a cause of her tendency to suffer episodes of falling.  Her prognosis must
be somewhat clouded in view of the continuing
episodes of admission to hospital
and the tendency to episodes of falling. However, the natural history of
myofacial pain syndromes
is a tendency to recurrent episodes, while at the same
time being responsive to reasonable conservative measures, as was demonstrated
by her response to the Inpatient North Shore Pain Programme."
<P>

70  	The treatment of the plaintiff at the Pain Clinic, and her
progress were amplified by the various further reports from Professor
Cousins
directed to Dr. Dallas, between February 1992 and July 1994, which were
tendered by the second defendant.  They do little
more than show a continuing
pattern of muscle spasm and pain that was treated with injections, stretching
exercises, physiotherapy,
the provision of a brace, and medication, which was
from time to time changed because of concerns in relation to hyperacidity,
gastroenterological
and urological problems and possible liver damage.  The
regime of medication noted included i/v Diazepam, Baclofren, Tryptanol,
Cisapride,
Tegretol, Prothiaden, Endone, Rivotril, Mexitill, Epilin, Losec,
Adalat, Natrilix, and Panadol.
<P>

71  	These reports also revealed that the falls were investigated by
repeat MRI examination and neurological study, without any
abnormality being
detected, raising for consideration the possibility of the medication being a
factor.  Other aspects under consideration
related to anxiety and behavioural
factors which led to a review by a psychiatrist, Dr. Malcolm Dent, which was
not placed into evidence.

<P>

72  	The final document in this line of correspondence was a letter
of 14 July 1994, to Dr. Dallas, in which Professor Cousins advised
that he did
not have any other avenue to suggest, and that as a consequence he did not
think it beneficial for the plaintiff to continue
to visit the Clinic. In none
of these letters, however, did Professor Cousins, a leading expert in the field
of pain management,
 suggest that the plaintiff was manufacturing her symptoms,
or that she was anything other than a genuine patient.
<P>

73  	Dr. Morgan, in a report dated 16 September 1994, noted that
using the Waddell Disability system, based on activities of daily
living, the
plaintiff ranked as 8/9.   He confirmed the presence of restrictions of active
and passive movements in the left ankle,
as well as tenderness in the ligaments
around the lateral and medial malleolus, and swelling above the line of the
ankle joint. 
In the back, he confirmed that CT scans showed some bulging
discs, facet joint hypertrophy, and osteoarthritis at L5/S1.  The symptom
of
sharp pain going down the leg with the onset of weakness and falling he said
was a fairly typical syndrome of the posterial root
ganglion compression which
he believed was present in this case. The aching pain down the front of the
right thigh he said appeared
to be referred from the bulging L3/L4 disc.
<P>

74  	At the same time Dr. Wegman reported that the plaintiff's
symptoms of reflux oesophagitis and ulceration may have been accentuated
with
her increase in weight, together with the use of tryptanol.
<P>

75  	In a report of 22 September 1994, Dr. Grady reviewed the
progress of the plaintiff in the light of his own re-examination of
her, and
his reading of some of the reports from the North Shore Pain Centre. In this
report he stated:
<P>

"I do not now think there is a great deal of evidence for a neurotic reaction,
hysterical or other.  Her motivation to co-operate
with treatment which has
been described in reports from North Shore Hospital and the Northside Pain
Clinic and her readiness to acknowledge
improvement are also against a
psychoneurotic reaction.
<P>

The cheerfulness, albeit superficial, could be simply from her personality
style and her decision to take a positive attitude to
her condition.
<P>

She remains disabled for domestic duties and employment to a very large extent,
but on the evidence available I don't think this
can be attributed mainly to
her emotional condition, less to a psychiatric disorder.
<P>

As to prognosis for future mental health and well being, it seems likely she
will go on as she is with the ups and downs in her
physical condition and using
the coping mechanisms which she has been using.  I do not think there is any
indication for direct psychiatric
treatment.
<P>

Although tendered by the second defendant, I do not see how this report assists
its case.
<P>

76  	Following these assessments, the plaintiff came under the care
of Dr. Sundaraj, to whom she was referred for chronic pain management
by the
Director of Accident and Emergency at Fairfield Public Hospital.   He first saw
her on 14 February 1995 in the orthopaedic
ward, to which she had been admitted
with severe low back pain radiating to both legs, and severe left ankle
pain.
<P>

77  	By this stage she was on a veritable cocktail of medication,
comprising Tryptanol, Tofranil, Epilin, Endone, Valium and Panadeine
Forte.
She was using a Tens machine and was on intermittent pethidine/morphine
injections for severe breakthrough pain.  Despite
all of this treatment, she
was still complaining of continuing back pain and bilateral lower limb pain.
Her weight at this stage
had gone out from about 90 kgs to 130 kgs, and she was
assessed as being in obvious pain and quite depressed. Dr. Sundaraj noted
that
"quite severe lumbar sacral muscular spasm was present", that straight leg
raising was no more than 20 degrees, and that swelling
and tenderness was
present around the left ankle and the whole of the left foot.   It was his
opinion that:
<P>

"Mrs. Hanzic sustained a work related injury resulting from a fall that
occurred in January of 1986.  She subsequently developed
Complex Regional Pain
Syndrome (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) Stage 1.   In view of continuation of
painful symptoms in her left
lower limb, she began developing severe low back
pain.  This would have resulted from abnormal posture, gait and difficulty with
weight bearing.  Reduced physical activity and consumption of large quantities
of different types of medications, would have given
rise to overweight
problems.  This once again compounding overall pathology.    In her lower back,
she was in fact suffering from
a fibromyalgia syndrome (Myofascial).  She has
been developing periodic acute painful episodes within the muscular skeletal
system."
<P>

78  	Treatment was initiated by him and progressed as follows:
<P>

(i)	pethidine injections were continued, as was the prescription of Rivotril,
Endone and Tryptanol.  All other medications were
withheld.
<P>

(ii)	On 16 February 1995 a left lumbar sympathetic block and an epidural at
L3/4 were carried out which led to some reduction of
the painful symptoms for
about 1 week.
<P>

(iii)	On 12 April 1995 she was admitted to Fairfield Heights Private Hospital
for a 5 level radiofrequency denervation of the L4/S1
facet joints - with no
benefit.
<P>

(iv)	 On 14 July 1995 she was readmitted to Fairfield Heights Hospital for a
trial of intrathecal Morphine, in the course of which
all other analgesics were
withdrawn.  There was significant relief.
<P>

(v)	On 1 August 1995, a Sychromed Morphine implant was inserted, leading to
excellent pain relief.  This procedure involved the
implantation of a battery
operated pump under the plaintiff's skin, programmed by computer to deliver
controlled amounts of morphine.
<P>

79  	As a result of this success, the plaintiff was referred to the
physiotherapist for a mobilising exercise program and for weight
reduction.
She was reported as responding extremely well, with a reduced pain level, and
with a much brighter and more positive outlook.
 With her increased physical
activity, the morphine dosage was increased, but she managed to go off most of
the other medication
other than the occasional Panadol or sleeping pill.  
<P>

80  	Her pain was significantly reduced but she continued to have
exacerbations which, if not brought quickly under control, led
to spasms and
further hospitalisations.  The development of these exacerbations, Dr. Sundaraj
explained, was not to be unexpected,
but they could be "quite easily
controlled" by increasing the morphine dosing.
<P>

81  	The subsequent progress, as recorded in Dr. Sundaraj's report of
13 September 1999, has  been in accordance with these predictions.
 In summary,
it appears from the Plaintiff's evidence or his report that:
<P>

(i)	As of April 1996, there was very mild base line pain with which the
plaintiff could cope, a resumption of more of her household
activities, an
improvement in her exercise profile, a loss of weight and improvement in her
confidence and self esteem;
<P>

(ii)	On 26 June 1996, after she complained of increased pain in the right lower
back, Dr. Sundaraj carried out medial branch radio
frequency denervation
therapy to the left L4-S1 facet joints;
<P>

(iii)	In April 1997 she developed an acute exacerbation of her low back pain,
associated with difficulty walking and weight bearing.
She was admitted to
Fairfield Hospital and then transferred to Westside Private Hospital on 2 May
where she remained as an inpatient
for six days.  During this period she was
reviewed by the physiotherapists, commenced on an exercise programme,
prescribed with a
variety of medications including Amitriptyline, Mersyndol,
Oxycodone, Parenteral Opioids, and Subcutaneous Ketamine.
<P>

(iv)	Subsequently she increased her social and physical activities, resuming
cycling, walking, knitting and sewing, and also taking
on a part time sales
representative job selling aroma therapy products on a party plan.  She also
enrolled in the Chronic Pain Support
Association, and began a Bible study
course.
<P>

(v)	In April 1998, she again developed an acute exacerbation of low back pain
which led to a readmission to Westside Private Hospital.
 Intensive
conservative treatment was recommended with increased medication,
physiotherapy, mobilising exercises and encouragement.
<P>

(vi)	In April 1999 there was another recurrence and admission to hospital, in
the course of which a local anaesthetic in combination
with Clonidine was
infused via an epidural catheter left in place for three days.  Intensive
physiotherapy was recommended.
<P>

82  	The hospital admissions noted above are those referred to by Dr.
Sundaraj in his reports.  The plaintiff's own records would
suggest some
additional admissions over this period  but in the absence of specific mention
in the reports, or in any supporting
hospital admission files, I am unable to
determine whether there were in fact further occasions on which she was
admitted to hospital.
 The admissions noted do, however, show a continuing
pattern of periods of relief and resumption of a degree of normal activity
followed
by periods of exacerbation leading to hospitalisations and follow up
treatment.
<P>

83  	In his final report of 13 September 1999,Dr. Sundaraj said:
<P>

"In summary, Phyllis Hansic's primary pathology appears to be one of deep
muscle spasm.  This seems to involve the paraspinal muscle,
the gluteus medius
and to some extent the sacraltuberous and the sacrospinalis group of muscles.
This is a <i>localised `Myofascial syndrome'</i>  which seems to be exacerbated
periodically for no apparent reason.  It is possible that she may be increasing
her physical activity
level thereby triggering the muscle spasm.  The right
lower limb pain extension could be arising from this site.  She complains of
periodic `giving way' of the lower limb.  This too would be of a soft tissue
involvement.  There is no abnormal neurological findings
on clinical
examination. Lower limb reflexes, sensory findings are intact.  No obvious
muscle wasting present.
<P>

She continues to maintain a stable weight of around 85-90kgs.  Uses a walking
stick occasionally as her confidence and/or support.
There is no evidence of
clinical depression, increased anxiety or any other `abnormal illness
behaviour'.  Self confidence and self
esteem continues to be preserved.
<P>

<b>Prognosis:  </b>  It would appear that she will always continue to complain
of some degree of baseline pain and disability in her low back and lower
limbs.
From her history thus far, presumably once a year, she seems to develop the
acute exacerbation of low back muscle spasm and
pain. She is requiring
hospitalisation, since she is unable to manage at home.  During this period,
intensive physiotherapy, increased
medications and psychological support seem
to be required.
<P>

I have suggested ongoing counselling sessions for relaxation therapy.  Phyllis
Hanzic is reluctant with this, since she has had
stress counselling on a number
of occasions previously and she reports practicing relaxation and other stress
management on her own
using music tapes, reading and other techniques.  There
is an <i>underlining component of psycho social issues</i> <i>which would be
playing a role in her pain and disability presentation</i>.  In comparison to
clinical condition and her general well being in the late 80s and early 90s she
has made a significant progress
and advancement.  From that point of view, her
prognosis though guarded seems optimistic.
<P>

She will be unable to return to her pre-injury duty as a supervisor in child
care centre on a full time employment.  However, she
may be able to resume very
light and selected duties for about 15-20 hours stretched over 3-4 days per
week.
<P>

Her lifting capacity, to be limited to about 5kgs, on an average and
occasionally able to lift to 10 kgs.  To minimise unnecessary
bending or
extension of her lumbar spine."
<P>

84  	In relation to the cost of maintaining the morphine implant, Dr.
Sundaraj said in his report of 27 March 1996:
<P>

"The morphine reservoir has a battery with a battery life between 5-8 years.
At the end of this, she will require a replacement
unit.  The cost of the
replacement unit would be similar to the original cost, i.e. around
($10-12,000) ten to twelve thousand dollars.
 Once again she will require about
5 days of hospital stay. In the meantime, she will require 3 monthly admission
into hospital and
as a day patient, requires refill of morphine reservoir. The
cost of this is around ($500.00) five hundred dollars at each visit.
<P>

In his more recent report, he said:
<P>

"This implant has in built battery, which generally lasts for about 4-6 years.
It is about this time that she will require a replacement
unit.  Instead of the
computer controlled Synchromed implant, if and when the battery gets low, I
will replace it with a gas driven
Isomed system. This costs about $7500 -
$8000,  Additional costs will include 2 days stay in hospital, theatre fees, my
professional
fees, anaesthetic and radiology costs.  The additional cost will
be around $4000 - $5000.  The gas driven Isomed does not require
replacement,
since there is no battery within the system. She will require 2 monthly
morphine refill.  This is due to the limit of
the reservoir volume and as per
the recommendation of the manufacturer.  The cost of each refill and
consultation will be identical
to the Syncromed refill cost."
<P>

Dr. Sundaraj said, in this report, that he expected the plaintiff to require
periodic physiotherapy on an ongoing basis, requiring
"about 20-30
consultations per year".  He also said that it was possible" that she would
require hospitalisation for acute exacerbation
management for "a few days each
year".
<P>

85  	None of the treating doctors was required for cross examination.
Their evidence stood unchallenged save so far as it was questioned
by the
medical practitioners qualified by the defendants, whose reports were tendered.
Of those only Dr. Burke, a surgeon, who had
examined the plaintiff on various
occasions between December 1988 and November 1996, was required for cross
examination.
<P>

86  	In the series of reports tendered Dr. Burke stated that he saw
no signs of sympathetic nerve dystrophy.  The symptoms of which
the plaintiff
complained he thought to be of a bizarre pattern, and not capable of
explanation in rational anatomical terms.  He
thought that he detected evidence
of exaggeration of the signs that she displayed, on examination, suggesting, on
one occasion, that
she had "voluntarily" induced a bout of leg twitching.  The
original ankle injury he expected would have resolved completely within
two to
four months. 
<P>

87  	The wider and progressive symptoms Dr. Burke considered to be
unrelated to the original fall.  His view in this regard was
expressed in a
report of 20 November 1991 as follows:
<P>

"It would seem that her symptom complexes and her pessimistic view of recovery
are being encouraged by enthusiastic attention from
her various medical
advisers.  It is disappointing to note that her weight has further increased.
There may well be degenerative
changes in the lumbar area and there may be
intermittent embarrassment of lumbo-sacral nerve roots.  However, no muscle
wasting or
limp is involved, and the degree of abnormality is obviously fairly
slight.   I would not agree with their diagnosis of sympathetic
dystrophy in
the left ankle region.  There are no signs to support such a diagnosis, nor
were there when I examined this woman in
1988.
<P>

It appears that there is a significant emotional element involved.
<P>

88  	When he reviewed the plaintiff in July 1993 following the fall
at the Pain Clinic, he found some "possible slight tenderness
and restrictive
movement" in the left ankle, but the signs elicited upon examination he
considered to be "deliberately exaggerated".
 Again he observed that "non
organic factors continue to overshadow her medical condition", a view repeated
in his report of 29 November
1995.
<P>

89  	On 19 March 1996 he confirmed that his previous findings and
opinion remained unchanged, observing:
<P>

"There is no residuum of any work injury.   No sequel of such need be expected.
The incident in 1986 does not adversely affect her
current fitness for work.
Her fitness for work is diminished by her obesity and general lack of fitness.
She is probably unfit for
work because of the therapeutic agents that have been
prescribed."
<P>

90  	In his final report of 29 November 1996 Dr. Burke opined:
<P>

"This woman apparently has mild old Scheuermann's disease of the thoraco-lumbar
region.  There is associated scoliosis.  There are
minimal degenerative
changes.  There is particular degenerative change at the L4/5 disc where there
has been some loss of disc height.
  However, there is no radiological evidence
of thecal or nerve root embarrassment.  There is osteoarthritis of the
weight-bearing
joints, and particularly at the right hip.  There is
osteoarthritis of the left ankle, and there was a fracture of the left lateral
malleolus in February 1993.
<P>

These studies did not show comparison view of the left hip and of the right
ankle.
<P>

She has complained of knee symptoms, but no x-rays of the knees have been
presented.  Ideally, x-rays of the hips, knees and ankles
should be taken for
comparison purposes.  It is possible that the osteoarthritic change at the left
ankle has been caused or aggravated
by trauma.  It would appear that the other
spinal and joint changes are present on a degenerative change, undoubtedly
abetted by
gross obesity.
<P>

It appears that her current lower limb symptoms are not easily explained on
rational physiological terms.  Perhaps assessment by
a neurologist would be
helpful.
<P>

Her inability to stand on one foot today was inconsistent with the manner in
which she was able to walk today."
<P>

91  	While he did not agree with the diagnosis that had been reached
by the treating doctors of sympathetic dystrophy in the left
ankle region, or
find any organic cause of continuing relevance for the plaintiff's symptoms, he
did not suggest that the treatment
provided by the Pain Management Centre or
its rehabilitation regime had been inappropriate. 
<P>

92  	He appeared to discount entirely the opinion offered by almost
all of the treating medical practitioners, that the extended
use of crutches
could have brought about postural changes and been the occasion for placing
extra strain on her right hip and back.
 He also appeared reluctant to accept
that the arthritic changes evident on X-ray of the left ankle, taken six days
after the 1993
fall, were an aftermath of the 1986 accident, although he
conceded the possibility of it having been the cause or an aggravating
cause of
that condition.
<P>

93  	He also conceded that it was possible for a fall to stir up a
degenerative but symptomless back condition of the kind that
was indicated by a
L4-5 disk bulge, although he said that he would have expected those symptoms to
emerge within a couple of weeks
of the fall.  Otherwise he appeared to have
placed a good deal of emphasis on his conclusion that the plaintiff, at the
times when
he saw her, had a problem of obesity which may have explained her
gait and restricted movements.  In this regard he did concede that
where an
overweight person falls, that factor of obesity was likely to cause an
increased injury or to compound its seriousness.
<P>

94  	He seems to have seen little of significance in the progress
made by the plaintiff under Dr. Sundaraj, and in particular her
weight loss and
increased mobility.  
<P>

95  	In the result, it seems to me that Dr. Burke's opinions attract
very much less weight than those of the treating physicians
and surgeons who
have uniformly accepted the genuineness of the plaintiff's complaints, and who
have attributed the symptom complex
including the Myofascial syndrome diagnosed
by Dr. Sundaraj, to the original ankle sprain, the changes in posture, and
uneven loading
of the hips and back that followed upon that injury, the later
ankle fracture, and the effects these all had in aggravating degenerative
changes in the hip and back.  Those experts have had the advantage of working
closely with the plaintiff, and of observing the extent
to which she had made
an effort during intensive treatment regimes, of seeing her when in episodes of
acute pain, and of seeing her
response when treated for those episodes.
<P>

96  	The remaining reports tendered by the defendants add little to
the case.  Dr. McInerney's report became irrelevant because
no claim was
pursued attributing the plaintiff's miscarriage, which occurred a few days
after the accident, to that event.  Dr. Barr,
who saw the plaintiff in
September 1994, and assumed the correctness of the history provided concerning
the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal
reflux, epigastric discomfort, and of
constipation, reported:
<P>

"She already demonstrated a  predisposition to reflux before her accident. I
think it is likely that her weight-gain has been a
provoking factor for the
recent reactivation of her reflux.  I would not think that the brief period on
anti-inflammatories was a
factor. She is taking Tryptanol in high doses at
night and the anti-cholinergic side-effect of this can aggravate reflux,
however.
 Her codeine-containing analgesics are almost certainly the reason for
the development of constipation.
<P>

From the GIT standpoint, I can see no limitation to her work capacity.  I don't
believe that any further treatment is necessary.
 Her gastrointestinal
conditions are not severe, and with regard to them, her prognosis would seem to
be very good."
<P>

The case for the plaintiff does not offer any different conclusion, and this
report only tends to confirm the likely linkage of
the weight gain consequent
upon medication, and the use of Tryptanol, to the relatively mild
gastroenterological problems that have
emerged.
<P>

97  	Dr. Boyd-Leigh, who saw the plaintiff on 1 May 1986, 28 August
1986 and again on 3 December 1987, reported on the first occasion
that the
ankle injury involved quite a severe strain which had left her with some
deformity which was still present.  He expected
that she would make a complete
recovery within three months, provided that she continued with the exercises
that had been prescribed
to overcome the flexion deformity that had developed.

<P>

98  	His clinical findings were largely the same at the time of the
second examination.  He still expected that with suitable active
exercise, and
staying away from passive manipulation of the kind that had been used, (by Dr.
Giblin) she would make a good recovery.
 The duration of the incapacity he said
"must be uncertain".  His final report was  more dismissive of the plaintiff in
so far as
he reported:
<P>

"Actual tests, in my opinion, are all normal and the responses are all
contrived.  I believe that there is still nothing wrong with
this lady.  She
shows no sign of wasting, no neurological defect as far as I can assess and she
refuses in many ways to co-operate
with examination."
<P>

99  	The value of these reports of Dr. Boyd-Leigh is diminished by
the circumstance that they were not updated, and they preceded
the aggravation
of which the plaintiff complained as time passed, particularly after the 1993
ankle fracture.
<P>

100  	Dr. Rob McMurdo, a psychiatrist, saw the plaintiff on 29
September 1988, 6 October 1993 and 15 January 1996.  At the first
consultation
Dr. McMurdo reported:
<P>

"It certainly is difficult to understand why a soft tissue injury should cause
such prolonged and severe disability and one would
wonder whether her
complaints are consistent with the physical pathology.  Only observation over a
very long period would help to
elaborate whether she is magnifying her
complaints.  It is possible that she has developed a sick role pattern of
behaviour.  It
is understandable that someone who has been very active, and who
has had many difficulties in their life with responsibilities and
worries about
the children, but then who has an injury during the course of her employment
that they should become distressed because
of the pain and interference with
the quality of life.  However, I do not think that Mrs. Hanzic has a formal
psychiatric illness
as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders.  If it can be shown that there is no physical pathology
in
the ankle, or the hip, then it is possible that she has the somatoform pain
disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental
Disorders (Third Edition Revised).  However, it is generally found that this
condition does not respond favourably
to formal medical treatment but rather to
rehabilitation.  It is also difficult to differentiate how much of the
condition is magnified
by conscious processes.
<P>

On her presentation today, the probability of her re-entering the workforce in
the near future seems very remote. It seems advisable
that litigation be
finalised as soon as possible.  Whether or not she has any significant organic
pathology, she firmly believes
that she has major damage in her foot and hip,
and from the comments she made to me, this could be partly iatrogenic in origin
from
the statements which have been made to her by treating doctors."
<P>

101  	At the time of the second examination, Dr. McMurdo reported
that the plaintiff "was not exaggerating, nor dramatising her
problems and
admitted to improvements where this had occurred ... she was  not overtly
depressed nor anxious."   His opinion was
as follows:
<P>

"From my further examination of the claimant she does appear to have adapted
quite well emotionally to her physical problems.  The
ongoing pain and
disturbance of sensation are certainly a problem to her but the ongoing
management of the pain clinic and her change
of philosophy towards her
difficulty do seem to have helped her to a considerable degree. She is more
bodily aware but not truly
hypochondriacal.  She lives a day to day existence
and although there is a marked interference with the quality of her life, she
does not have a specific psychiatric disorder as defined in the SSM-III-R
classification of mental disorders.  From the purely psychological
point of
view she would be fit for employment but the physical conditions prevent this
and I will leave other specialists to comment
thereon.  The prognosis rests
with her physical state rather than her psychological condition at this point
in time".
<P>

102  	By the time of the final examination, which occurred after the
morphine pump implant, Dr. McMurdo noted:
<P>

"During the course of the interview the applicant was quite relaxed, composed,
and overtly quite positive with no evidence of anxiety
or depression."
<P>

His opinion was as follows:
<P>

"From my further examination of the plaintiff I can find no evidence of any
psychiatric disorder.  There is no doubt that she has
suffered a considerable
interference with the quality of her life and there is not likely to be any
remarkable improvement in the
future.  She certainly is better for having much
less medication. Prior to the insertion of the morphine pump she was needing
fairly
high does of analgesics, sedatives and antidepressants.  These are no
longer necessary except in emergencies so that she is much
more alert, has
better memory, and is more agile, within the restrictions placed on her by her
back.  She has lost some weight which
is beneficial for her and this is
probably due to the combined effects of ceasing the antidepressants which
frequently cause weight
gain, and being more active physically.
<P>

Although the question of work is really academic given her physical disability,
from the purely psychological point of view she
could cope with employment if
any were possible for her.  The prognosis rests with the orthopaedic surgeons
and she is not in need
of any psychiatric treatment."
<P>

103  	These reports tend, if anything, to assist the plaintiff's
case, so far as Dr. McMurdo does not suggest her to have been malingering.
Otherwise they raise the possibility that the progression of the symptoms can
be attributed to iatrogenic factors or to the development
of somatoform pain
disorder, neither of which involves any voluntary choice or intervention on the
patient's part.
<P>

<b>Resolution of the medical issues</b>
<P>

104  	In my view far greater weight should be placed upon the
opinions of the treating medical practitioners  and upon the explanations
they
have offered, for the progressive deterioration in the plaintiff's condition
prior to the implantation of the morphine pump.
 The immediate relative success
of this procedure tends to suggest that there has been a genuine and continuing
organic cause for
at least a portion of the plaintiff's symptoms, as well as a
degree of positive motivation on her part since that time.
<P>

105  	So far as the defence sought to rely upon video surveillance of
the plaintiff over a couple of days in May 1992, I am quite
unimpressed by the
suggestion that it showed her to be coping with physical activity or to be free
in her movements. For the most
part it shows her walking about slowly with a
distinct limp, and bending occasionally in an unremarkable and unhurried way.
True
it is that she can be seen to have been standing for extended periods
while watching a netball game, but she can also be seen to
be moving about and
leaning forwards from the hips from time to time, in a manner that was
consistent with the techniques which she
explained she had adopted for the
purpose of maintaining some degree of physical mobility.  At no point can she
be seen to move quickly
or to engage in some form of activity that required any
degree of exertion.
<P>

106  	Upon my assessment of the whole of the evidence, after a close
examination of that given by the plaintiff, by her daughter
Michelle, by Ms
Woolcock, and by the medical experts, I accept that the plaintiff has suffered
from the symptoms of which she complained,
and from the progression in those
symptoms that she described.  I do not consider her to have been malingering or
to have voluntarily
behaved in such a way as to feign signs or symptoms for the
examining doctors.  The evidence of continuing falls, of apparent continuing
distress and pain, and the presence of objective signs of muscular spasm would
be difficult to manufacture.  Moreover, it is extremely
unlikely that anyone
who had been as active as the plaintiff had been before the first fall, and who
was bringing up six children,
would undergo the rigorous, extensive and
uncomfortable series of hospital admissions, rehabilitation programmes,
medication and
the like for monetary gain alone, or without genuine cause. 
<P>

107  	The symptoms and progression described by the plaintiff of pain
and swelling in the ankle after the initial injury which was
treated with
strapping, a leg plaster, analgesia, acupuncture,  physiotherapy and the use of
crutches for an extensive period, followed
by the onset of pain in the right
hip and back extending down the legs, and of falls commencing in early 1991 and
associated with
spasm, is consistent with an aetiology involving uneven loading
and stressing of the back and hip following an alteration in posture
and gait
associated with the use of walking aids or crutches, as described by the
treating doctors.   So is the history that the
plaintiff gave in evidence, of a
deterioration in these symptoms as she tried to push through the problems with
extra activity, as
encouraged by the Pain Clinic, and of further complications
after the ankle fracture.  The fall occasioning that fracture can, in
my view,
be causally related to the original fall, in that it was the sequelae of the
original injury which caused her leg to give
way from time to time, as I find
occurred on this occasion.  There is no suggestion, let alone any evidence, of
the fall down the
Pain Clinic stairs as occurring otherwise than as the
plaintiff described.
<P>

108  	I am satisfied that this further  injury tended only to
aggravate the ankle disability, to compound the arthritic changes
that I am
satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, are attributable to the original
ligamentous strain, and to occasion a further
period of uneven loading of the
back and hips when the plaintiff returned to the use of crutches.  These
problems I am satisfied
were also compounded by the weight gain which, upon the
basis of the medical evidence summarised above,  should properly  be attributed
to the reduction in physical activities enforced on the plaintiff, and to the
multiple medications prescribed.  The weight gain,
and the further falls, were
each contributing factors, I am satisfied, in conjunction with the uneven
loading, to a process which
rendered symptomatic the previously asymptomatic
degenerative changes that were emerging in the plaintiff's back and hips.
<P>

109  	So far as the plaintiff has experienced gastric symptoms, they
can also be properly considered to be causally connected with
the original
injury, in so far as there is evidence that medication of the kind taken by the
plaintiff and weight gain are known
to bring them on.  
<P>

110  	The position in summary is a complex one of compounding causes
all attributable, I am satisfied, to the original ankle injury
and to the
regime for treatment which followed.
<P>

111  	By reference to these matters, I find the plaintiff has had and
continues to have, significant disabilities related to her
ankle, hip and back
which are causally related to the fall on the stairs of 9 January 1986, and
which to a significant degree have
the organic basis described.  I am also
satisfied that, to a degree, these symptoms are iatrogenic in nature and that
there is an
emotional component attributable to the quite exceptional medical
and pharmacological intervention that has taken place, the sick
role associated
with that intervention, the resulting anxiety, anger and distress engendered by
the very intensity of that treatment,
the inevitable preoccupation with it, and
the apparent failure to achieve a beneficial result.  I would expect there to
be some,
although not complete, resolution once these proceedings are
finalised, particularly in view of the more positive outcome offered
by the
procedures undertaken by Dr. Sundaraj.   I note that there is some support for
the presence of an emotional or iatrogenic
component in the reports of Dr.
Mahoney, Giblin and Sundaraj, and to a lesser extent in the reports of Doctors
Burke and McMurdo,
and also in the report of Professor Cousins of 23 March
1993.
<P>

<b>Heads of Damages       </b>
<P>

112  	There was agreement for arithmetic purposes, in respect of the
components going to make up the heads of damages claimed, although
not as to
the plaintiff's entitlement to their recovery.
<P>

113  	It was the plaintiff's case, in broad terms, that she has been
substantially disabled since the accident, and that such position
will continue
for the remainder of her life.  Upon that basis, she claimed virtual
destruction of her earning capacity subject only
to an ability to work in a
limited part time capacity, upon her own terms, in the party plan venture in
which she has been involved
in recent times, or in some similar activity.  In
addition, she claimed significant damages for domestic services, past and
ongoing
medical and hospital treatment, and general damages.
<P>

114  	It was the case for the defendants, however, that she has been
nowhere near as disabled as she claims, or alternatively, that
her disabilities
are unrelated to the accident.  Upon that basis, it was their submission that
she was entitled to recover damages
for economic and related financial losses
for a relatively brief closed period, and to limited general damages.  In the
event of
this submission not receiving favour, it was put, in the alternative,
that her claims for domestic services, and for continuing losses,
should be
confined to very modest amounts.
<P>

<b>Past Out of Pocket Expenses</b>
<P>

115  	The amount which was agreed to be recoverable, as
particularised in Ex F, was $4,592.2 (item (a)). This includes various sums
expended in the immediate aftermath of the January 1986 fall, ie for the
treatment of the ankle sprain.  
<P>

116  	Agreement was reached as to the components of two other
categories of expenditure for which accounts were sighted, again as
particularised in Exhibit F.  
<P>

117  	The first category (item (b)) related to the investigation and
treatment concerning the progression  of symptoms from about
1990, at or
through the North Shore Pain Centre, or subsequently under the care of
Dr.Sundaraj, in the sum of $118,294.15.  These
amounts the defendants accepted
as recoverable only if the progression of symptoms was found to be causally
related to the fall and
original injury.  
<P>

118  	The second category (item (c)) related to  expenses submitted
to be unrelated to  the original injury, or to the progression
of symptoms, but
referable to other causes, including cardiovascular investigation,  and the
provision of items such as a travel
cushion, a flotation/electric lift-up
chair, a back brace, orthopaedic shoes and surgical stockings, in the sum of
$4,108.50.
<P>

119  	Having regard to my finding that the progression of the
plaintiff's symptoms was causally related to the original accident
and fall,
having been brought on by the uneven loading and stress occasioned to the
plaintiff's back and hips by the prolonged use
of walking aids, rendering
symptomatic degenerative changes in the back; by the explosion in the
plaintiff's weight from 90kgs to
130kgs. (20 stone) due to the medication which
was prescribed, and to the enforced inactivity that resulted from the original
fall;
by the onset of back/hip pain; and by the further falls with their
sequelae attributable to the resulting deterioration in the plaintiff's
condition,  I am satisfied that the amounts contained in the further two
categories are recoverable, with the exception of the sum
of $540 for
cardiovascular services.
<P>

120  	The plaintiff gave evidence of receiving relief by the use of
the back brace, orthopaedic shoes, surgical stockings, lambswool
blanket, ankle
brace and lift up chair.  She said that these items facilitated her in
remaining mobile and in driving a car, and
were of value in limiting the
occasions of flare up.  While the need for the lift-up chair was not all that
clear, in the absence
of evidence from the defendants challenging its utility,
I am left only with the plaintiff's evidence that it was beneficial and
was
recommended by the Pain Clinic.  I accept that evidence.  I am not, however,
persuaded, in the absence of any evidence as to
why they were needed, that the
cardiovascular diagnostic services were related to the accident.  I disallow
this item. In the result,
the damages under this head I assess as follows:
<P>

Item (a)	 $4,592.20
<P>

(b)	$118,294.15
<P>

(c)	<u>$    4,108.50</u>		$126,994.85
<P>

						<u>-      540,000</u>  (disallowed)
<P>

						$126,454.85
<P>

<b>Future out of pocket expenses</b>
<P>

121  	These claims were related to the replacement of the morphine
implant pump either in its present form (every 6.5 years), or
by the new type
of gas driven Isomed system mentioned by Dr. Sundaraj (once only), in each case
for a present cost of $15,000 (a
sum which is somewhat higher than the range of
$11,500 to $13,000 specified by Dr. Sundaraj in his report of 13 September
1999);
 Pump refills (every 8 weeks) at a current agreed cost of $731 each
refill;  visits to Dr. Sundaraj eight times a year at an agreed
cost of $10.77
per week;  physiotherapy, acupuncture, and hydro therapy at a current weekly
cost of $133 per week;  and recurring
hospitalisations at a cost of $4,600 per
annum (or $88.46 per week).
<P>

122  	So far as the pump was concerned, the calculation for
replacement of the existing unit, allowing for deferral, upon an annual
present
cost of $15,000, was agreed between the parties as follows:
<P>

First replacement at age 50			$14,576
<P>

Second replacement at age 56.5		$11,844
<P>

	
<P>

Third replacement at age 63			  $9,638
<P>

Fourth replacement at 70.5			   $8,307
<P>

Fifth replacement at 77			<u>$  6,365</u>
<P>

          $50,730
<P>

123  	This cost could be reduced, upon this basis, to $14,576 if, at
the first replacement, the newly available Isomed unit was
used.  I see no
reason why this alternative should not be the preferred choice.  Upon the
basis, as I find it to be the case, that
the plaintiff will need to continue
with a morphine pump implant for some time into the future, although not
necessarily for the
remainder of her agreed anticipated life expectancy of
35.82 years,  I am satisfied that damages should be provided for a single
replacement.  Although the starting point of $15,000 before deferral is
somewhat higher than the sum of $13,000, which was the upper
amount nominated
by Dr. Sundaraj, I see no reason to make allowance other than for the agreed
sum.
<P>

124  	An agreed multiplier of 1137.9 was adopted, allowing for
deferral, for the recurrence of the other relevant expenses over
the remaining
anticipated life expectancy of the plaintiff.  Where life tables are used for
the purposes of calculations such as
those required under the present head,
there is a built-in discount for contingencies, and no further allowance is
required for the
ordinary vicissitudes of life.  However, in the present case,
I am of the view that once this case is behind the plaintiff, some
of the
emotional and iatrogenic effects, which I find to be involved, are likely to
retreat, with a corresponding opportunity for
some further resolution of her
condition.  
<P>

125  	There can be no certainty in that regard, and the prospects of
improvement which I find to be realistic, are best allowed
for in my view by a
discount of 15%.  The discount contended for by the Second Defendant on this
account, I note was in the order
of 50%, a percentage which I regard as both
unreasonable and unrealistic. 
<P>

126  	Otherwise, it does appear that eight weekly refills and reviews
by Dr. Sundaraj would be appropriate, and that, in accordance
with past
experience and Dr. Sundaraj's report of September 1999, hospital admissions are
likely to be required for several days
each year, for occasions of "acute
exacerbation management", as described by Dr. Sundaraj, for the immediately
foreseeable future,
but not necessarily for the remainder of the Plaintiff's
life.  
<P>

127  	The sum of $4,600 per annum suggested by the plaintiff seems to
reflect considerably more than the "hospitalisation for `acute
exacerbation
management' for a few days each year" mentioned by Dr. Sundaraj.  The precise
basis for the calculation of the sum of
$4,600 was not shown, but it apparently
reflected an averaging of the hospital costs incurred over recent years. 
<P>

128  	The plaintiff bears the onus of proving the quantification of
this component.  However, since it appears from the submissions
that the sum
has been agreed, there is no reason why I should depart from it.  For the
reasons earlier mentioned, I propose similarly
to apply a discount of 15% for
the contingency of some further resolution of the plaintiff's condition, and
for consequent lessening
in the frequency of the hospital admissions .  
<P>

129  	The requirement for physiotherapy, acupuncture and hydro
therapy has not been shown to my satisfaction, to be anywhere near
the sum of
$133 per week claimed. The evidence does not supply any such claim.  The
plaintiff gave no evidence of currently being
on a weekly regime of
hydrotherapy or of regular acupuncture or physiotherapy, and the schedule of
expenses does not support a current
annual claim in any way approximating the
sum of $6,916 which was initially pressed upon me, in respect of this
component.  The plaintiff's
acupuncturist died some years ago and no evidence
was given of any other practitioner in this field having been consulted by her.
The claim for hydrotherapy, it was conceded, should be  compressed into the
physiotherapy claim.
<P>

130  	Dr. Sundaraj in his September 1999 report, estimated the need
for periodic consultation of a physiotherapist to be of the
order of twenty to
thirty consultations per year , ie approximately one such treatment each
fortnight.  I accept that at times of
acute exacerbation, some more intensive
treatment, involving several courses of physiotherapy, may be required and that
during times
of quiescence there may be no need for it.  Absent more specific
evidence on this aspect of the claim, I propose to allow an amount
for all
forms of physiotherapy necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the plaintiff,
calculated at the rate of $40 per week. 
I will apply the chosen multiplier,
and the same discount of 15% for contingencies referable to the possibility
that the need for
such treatment will abate over time.
<P>

131  	Upon this basis, I assess the future loss in accordance with
the agreed figures as follows:
<P>

Replacement pump at age 50
<P>

	Cost deferred				$14,576
<P>

Future visits to Dr. Sundaraj
<P>

	$10.77 pw x 1137 .9 x .85		$10,417
<P>

Pump refills
<P>

	$91.38 pw x 1137.9 x .85		$88,384
<P>

Physiotherapy
<P>

	$40 pw x 1137.9 x .85			$38,689
<P>

Recurring Hospitalisation
<P>

	$88.46p.w.  x $1137.9 x .85		<u>$85,560</u>
<P>

						        $237,626
<P>

132  	In case there be any doubt about it, I specify that the above
findings are based upon my conclusion that the plaintiff's current
disabilities
are genuine and are causally related to the 1986 fall and injury.  The
assessment has, however, been significantly reduced
from that.  I am of the
view that with the resolution of these proceedings, and with the lifting of
some of the emotional and iatrogenic
components, there is a realistic prospect
of the plaintiff experiencing some improvement in her condition in the future,
or at least
of not having to resort to the extraordinarily heavy reliance upon
medical assistance that has characterised the past.
<P>

<b>Past diminution of Economic Capacity</b>
<P>

133  	For arithmetic purposes, and subject to certain critical
assumptions, the past economic loss was agreed in a net sum of $172,839.21.
This calculation assumed that:
<P>

(i)	the plaintiff would have continued in the casual part time work in the
pharmacy, where she was working at the time of the fall,
or in an equivalent
position;
<P>

(ii)	she would have been remunerated in accordance with the award rates ($151
per week net at the time of the accident, rising to
$362.40 per week net at the
present time);
<P>

(iii)	she would have worked in the job twenty hours per week from the time the
January 1996 vacation care  programme ceased until
5 February 1988; 25 hours
per week between that date and 22 September 1988; 30 hours per week from that
date until 22 March 1989,
35 hours per week from that date until 3 August 1990;
and thereafter full time.
<P>

(iv)	From 2 September 1997 until the present time, she has been earning $70 per
week net in her party plan position.
<P>

134  	This claim was pursued upon the basis that the plaintiff would
have increased her hours of work to take on two and possibly
three extra
evening shifts, (the evidence being not entirely clear as to the number) in
accordance with an offer which had been extended
to her before the fall, and
that she would have progressively extended these hours, as the children became
older, rising to a full
40 hours per week after the youngest child, Edouard,
became old enouogh to go to school in 1990.   
<P>

135  	While there is no distinction in principle in assessing damages
for past and future diminution in earning capacity, it is
convenient and
possible to deal with this head separately, and to examine it against known
past facts, with a little more certainty
than is available where the assessment
is for a future loss. 
<P>

136  	It was the submission of the First Defendant that the plaintiff
should be regarded as having made a full recovery from the
initial fall within
twelve months or so, and that any ongoing diminution in her earning capacity
was related to other factors.  It
accordingly submitted that this head of
damage should be confined to a closed period of one year or thereabouts, at a
rate of $195.09
net per week, (a sum averaged out upon a basis of eight weeks
for the remainder of the Vacation Care Program at the rate of $248.10
per week
net, and of 48 weeks employment with the pharmacy at a rate of $170 per week
net) i.e. in the sum of $9,949.59.
<P>

137  	The second defendant submitted that in the absence of evidence
as to the manner in which the plaintiff would or could have
restructured her
household to accommodate full time work, and in the absence of evidence from
the manager of the pharmacy to corroborate
the availability of increased hours
and eventually of full time work, the wider claims could not be substantiated.
It also submitted
that the plaintiff should have been able to work through much
of the period since the accident, and that she had not made any reasonable
attempt to mitigate her loss by seeking vocational advice or retraining for
alternative avenues of employment. Taking into account
the circumstance that
she has now recently been engaged in an economic endeavour, selling
aromatherapy products via a party plan,
the submission of this defendant was
that, subject to proof of causation and mitigation arguments, the plaintiff's
loss since the
accident (720 weeks) had not exceeded upon average $100 per week
net, sounding in a maximum recoverable sum in the order of $72,000.
<P>

138  	The plaintiff gave evidence to the effect that, apart from
working four hourly shifts (extending occasionally to six hours)
in the
pharmacy on Tuesday and Friday evenings, and on Saturdays and Sundays during
the day, averaging about 20 hours per week (a
figure slightly in excess of the
15 hours noted in Exhibit 8), she had been involved in the Vacational Care
Program since May 1984.
 She had an arrangement to take on extra evening shifts
on Mondays and Wednesdays as the girl doing those shifts was leaving the
pharmacy.  She had not returned to any of this work in the pharmacy or in the
Vacational Care Program after the accident, because
her injury and the
progression of symptoms rendered her incapable of doing so.  
<P>

139  	The evidence she gave concerning her past and future capacity
to work is encapsulated in the following passages:
<P>

 "Q. What about your capacity to work?  Since the fall at school in January
1986 up until now do you feel that you have had any
capacity to work?  A. No I
haven't been able to have the capacity to work.
<P>

Q. If you had not been injured, what was your intention as to work?  A.   My
intention was I was really enjoying the work at the
pharmacy, because  I worked
in a pharmacy when I first left school, so I enjoyed pharmacy work greatly.
And it was - the job was
really great because I worked in the evenings on
weekends, which meant my husband was with the children and I wasn't having to
leave
them.  I was picking up extra hours, and the following year I was looking
at going into full time work because my son would have
been in preschool.
<P>

Q.  Would you have continued through - A. Yes.
<P>

Q.  --- up to the present time and into the future?  A. yes, I would have.  I
like being busy.
<P>

Q. How old are you now?  A. 48.
<P>

Q. Up until the present time, you haven't been able to do that?  A. I haven't
been able to do that.
<P>

Q. Or do any work? A. No.
<P>

Q. What about the future?  How do you se the future?  A. I've got - as to going
out and working for a job, I can't  see that happening.
<P>

Q. Why not?   A. Because I am very unreliable because I don't know from one day
to the next what I'm going to be able to cope with.
<P>

Q. Do you think you couldn't hold down a 9 to 5 job?  No, no way.
<P>

Q. Do you think you could get any work, cope with any work, on a regular basis?
A. I don't think so.
<P>

Q. Is that for the reason that you just gave?  A. yeah.
<P>

Q. I mean that you don't know -  A. The pain that's with me all the time, I
don't like actually to have - I wouldn't like to do
something with
responsibility because sometimes the pain clouds my mind even still, but not to
the extent that it used to before.
And even if I do an activity one day or the
next day, I have to have a rest day, so I can't do something that's
repetitious, day
after day."
<P>

140  	Her evidence in relation to the party plan was as follows:
<P>

"Q. Can you tell us a bit about what you have done to that end?  A. Okay. Just
on two years ago when I started feeling a lot better,
and getting my life back
in order, I started selling aromatherapy products, a diversional therapy.  I
was using the products myself.
<P>

Q. Tell us about that?  A. That is through a company called Lereve.  It is  a
party plan thing where I go to a person's house once,
maybe twice, a week,
demonstrate, tell them how to use the aromatherapy oils etc and it might be two
to three hours once a week or
twice a week. They order the products. I order
them from the company.  Then a couple of the children also help with that as
well.
 And sometimes if I'm not well enough to go and do it myself, one of my
daughters will also go and do it.
<P>

Q. Who pays you?  A. It is commission.  I buy the products at a lesser price to
what I sell them.
<P>

Q.  And how long have you been doing this?  A. I started - it will be two years
in December.
<P>

Q. And how did you find that, what effect?  A. I find that it is really a
diversional therapy because it gets me thinking about
something else.  I've
enjoyed learning about the products, the oils and how to use them in
relationship to my own pain and my own
health and reading a lot in that, so I
have enjoyed doing that part of it.  Even on bad days I'll get someone to drive
me there and
it will keep my mind off it, and if I'm having a bad day, there
has been a couple of times where I have actually been at the stage
of using a
walker, and when I've got to the person's place I've got the lady to hide that
in the bedroom so the people don't know
that I've got it.   I'm away from the
house and it helps keep my mind keep off the pain.
<P>

Q. About how much would you say that you have earned over the last two years?
A.  When I worked it out, it worked out, because I
don't do it every week and
each time it is a different amount, but over the twelve months I earned about
$70 a week.
<P>

Q. That you have collected from it?  A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Do you propose to keep going at that?  A. Yes."
<P>

141  	Accepting, as I do, the plaintiff's history of her symptoms and
their progression, and in the light of the quite exceptional
medical regime
into which she has been  received, I find that she has been prevented from
working during the period to date, subject
only to the more recent capacity to
work, at her own pace, and under her own direction, in the party plan
enterprise.  In this regard
I accept that she would have found any job
involving prolonged standing and physical activity of any magnitude or
continuity out
of the question.  More significantly, however, I find that she
needed all her energy to push through the programs of rehabilitation
activity
recommended to her by the treating doctors, and that it would have been
necessary for her to take regular breaks from any
work position for rest and
for in-patient treatment.  In those circumstances she simply could not have
held down any full time or
part time permanent position.
<P>

142  	That disposes of most of the defendants' arguments.   There
remains, however, the question whether she could and would have
taken up the
longer hours assumed, or whether she would have exercised to the full her
undoubted economic capacity, absent the accident,
over the entire period to
date.  
<P>

143  	This question needs to be considered in the light of the
evidence concerning her family.  She was married to a man engaged
in the
accounting profession, and she had six children, all of whom lived at home
until Bianca left in 1994, at the age of 20 years.
 At the time of the January
1986 fall the eldest child was 11 years old and the youngest was three years
old.  Apart from the usual
domestic duties, and part time pharmacy and vacation
care work, the plaintiff was a Brownie leader and was involved in taking the
children to dancing and singing lessons and sporting activities, helping with
their school work, and engaging in some recreational
interests of her own,
including those within her Church.  By reason of the "old fashioned view" which
the plaintiff agreed her husband
had in relation to "women's work", which she
attributed to his cultural background, the running of the domestic household
was largely
her responsibility.  It had also been her intention to have
additional children beyond the six who had already been born.  Her earnings,
she acknowledged, were used for "extras" and were not  essential for the family
support.  
<P>

144  	In all these circumstances, taking into account her husband's
attitude, and the heavy demands made upon a mother in a family
including six
children, all born within a period of nine years, I am not persuaded that the
plaintiff would necessarily have taken
on all of the extra hours with the
pharmacy posited, or had she done so that such an increase would have occurred
as early as the
calculation assumes.  
<P>

145  	In coming to this conclusion I do take into account that the
plaintiff was obviously an extremely active and enthusiastic
person and that
she liked the work in the pharmacy.  It is more likely, I believe, that she
would have taken on some extra shifts,
increasing her hours to something in the
order of twenty-five hours per week, and that from time to time she would have
taken on
further work relieving other employees on a temporary basis, even up
to the full hours suggested, on occasions.  
<P>

146  	Subject to the usual contingencies of life, it may have been
the case that in more recent years, e.g. from 1994 (when the
oldest child was
twenty years and the youngest child was eleven years) the plaintiff would have
taken on full time employment.  It
might also have been the case that after a
lengthy period of employment, e.g. ten years or so by 1993, she  would have
gone out of
the work force for a time, so as to indulge in other interests.
Much would have depended on family demands, and competing interests.
<P>

147  	For these reasons, there is in my view a need to make some
adjustment to the loss calculated by the plaintiff.  This is not
an easy task,
nor one that permits of a precise calculation.   Doing the best I can to ensure
that the plaintiff receives damages
reasonably commensurate to her loss, I
consider it appropriate to discount the full claim as calculated by her by a
factor of 25%.
 The loss so calculated is $172,839 x 0.75 = $129,629.
<P>

148  	For greater certainty, I confirm that I have rejected the
defendants' submission that the plaintiff had an exercisable capacity
to work
over the full period, and that she failed to mitigate her loss by not seeking
alternative employment or retraining.  She
participated fully, and
cooperatively, upon the face of the medical evidence tendered, in the various
rehabilitation and treatment
programmes, yet her problems remained.  Absent an
ability  to report for work daily, without breaks for rest and treatment, and
with
the cocktail of medication and aids that have been provided for her, it is
unrealistic to expect that she could have obtained employment
in any other
position, or to have engaged in any form of activity other than one of the kind
available through the party plan.
<P>

<b>Fox v Wood</b>
<P>

149  	This was agreed at $3,653.
<P>

<b>Past Superannuation</b>
<P>

150  	An agreed calculation was made, working on the assumed wage
figures in full time employment since 1 July 1993, at the statutory
rates, less
20% for tax, in the sum of $4,512.00.  No specific submission was directed, in
respect of this head of loss, but it may
be assumed that the same arguments
apply as to causation, mitigation and the like.  Subject to some adjustment to
take into account
my concerns as to the improbability of the plaintiff having
worked to the level assumed in her calculation, I consider it reasonable
to
make allowance for this claim in a sum I round off at $3,400.
<P>

<b>Future Economic Loss</b>
<P>

151  	The plaintiff claimed damages for impairment of her future
earning capacity for seventeen years to age sixty-five, subject
to a discount
of 15% for vicissitudes.  The calculation which the plaintiff advanced was
based upon an assumed continuing loss of
 capacity to earn sounding in a sum of
$290 per week net, to which was applied a multiplier of 697.3, and a discount
of 15% for contingencies,
sounding in a sum of $171,884.45.  The base figure of
$290 took into account an allowance of $70 per week for the Party Plan
activities.
 Although there was some confusion in the plaintiff's submission as
to the net weekly award figure, it appears to have been ultimately
agreed at
$362.40.  I accept it as the base line upon which the plaintiff seeks damages
for this head of loss.   From it must be
deducted an amount representing the
residual working capacity of the plaintiff, through the Party Plan of $70 per
week.
<P>

152  	The defendants did not accept any entitlement to recovery on
this account.  In the alternative, the second defendant submitted,
subject to
causation and the other issues as to the genuineness of the plaintiff's
injuries being resolved adversely to it, that
the plaintiff retained a capacity
to perform light work for at least fifteen to twenty hours per week, spread
over three to four
days, sounding upon its submission in a loss calculated as
not exceeding $50 per week x 697.3 x .85 = $29,635.
<P>

153  	Some support for that proposition was derived from the most
recent report of Dr. Sundaraj, although the fifteen to twenty
hours he had in
mind was qualified in so far as it was expressed in terms of a "possibility";
in so far as it was directed to "very
light and selected duties ... stretched
over 3 - 4 days per week" and in so far as it excluded all but the very
lightest lifting,
and "minimised unnecessary bending and extension of the
lumbar spine."  So qualified, the prospects of the plaintiff securing such
a
position, at her age, and in the open labour market, must be regarded as
relatively remote.
<P>

154  	The future remains uncertain.  It is subject to the morphine
implant and conservative management limiting the frequency of
exacerbations,
and to the possibility previously mentioned of there being some improvement of
the plaintiff's condition once these
proceedings are resolved.  It is also
subject to preoccupation and anxiety levels abating if the likely iatrogenic
and emotional
components are allowed to retreat. 
<P>

155  	The plaintiff's claim is subject to the assumption, which I
consider dubious, that, irrespective of the usual contingencies,
she would have
wished to work in a full time capacity without interruption, to the age of 65
years.   It is also subject to the contingency
that she would have gone on to
develop symptomatic degenerative changes even without the intervention of the
accident, given the
evidence of their presence and the fact that she always had
a potential weight problem, being 90 kgs. or thereabouts at the time
of the
fall.  
<P>

156  	Doing the best I can, taking into account all these features
and the expert evidence concerning her current prognosis, I propose
to assess
damages, for this head, upon the basis of an ongoing diminution in earning
capacity reflected by a net weekly loss of $170
per week.  So calculated, this
head of damages is assessed, with a discount of 15% for contingencies, as
follows:
<P>

$170 per week x 697.3 x 0.85 = $100,760
<P>

<b>Future Superannuation</b>
<P>

157  	There was agreement for arithmetic purposes, based upon a
weekly gross wage of $464.90, at rates of 7% for 1.5 years, at 8%
for 1 year,
and at 9% for the future, less tax, that the value of the contributions lost
would be $15,929.  This sum should be reduced
to reflect some allowance for the
usual contingencies, and for the improbability of the plaintiff having elected
to work in a full
time capacity to age sixty-five, to a sum I round off at
$9,500.
<P>

<b>General Damages</b>
<P>

158  	It was the plaintiff's submission that these should be awarded
within a range of $250,000 to $300,000.  This may be compared
with the sum of
$40,000 which the first defendant submitted was appropriate, and a sum within a
range of $60,000 to $80,000 suggested
by the second defendant (apportioned as
to one half for the past).
<P>

159  	Without restating my findings, and the reasons therefor, I am
satisfied that the fall in 1986 has had disastrous effects for
the plaintiff,
and converted what was an extremely active and productive life into one that
has been fraught with pain and difficulties,
and into one that has required
almost endless medical investigation, medication and treatment in one form or
another.  During the
most intense period of treatment,  her weight blew out to
gross limits, and generally her family and social life were seriously
disrupted.
 From the happy and active person she once was she changed for a
significant time between about 1989/1990 and 1995 to an angry, impatient
and
anxious person afflicted with a sick role.  
<P>

160  	It is only in relatively recent years that she has been able to
emerge  to some extent from that situation and to regain some
semblance of her
former life.  She is now less dependent on medication.  She has some capacity
to resume her social activities and
to work in a limited capacity.  During the
period of her most serious disability, from 1988/89 to late 1995, her
relationship with
her family was strained, and her marriage broke down, leading
to a separation from her husband in 1994.  The difficulties within
the marriage
I am satisfied are related to the disabilities flowing from the original fall
and the sequelae of its progress and treatment.
 At the present time, she has
limited capacity for physical activity beyond the exercise regime recommended
to her.  There are, however,
some hobbies and activities which she can
undertake, and which she should be able to continue.
<P>

161  	These are serious matters for an active person who had the
pleasure of a large family. I would assess the general damages
in the sum of
$200,000 of which I would apportion one half to the past.
<P>

164  	In her evidence in chief, the plaintiff agreed with questions
put to her by her Counsel producing somewhat higher estimates
than those in the
Schedule - e.g. 14 hours per week for 8.5 years in the case of Bianca;  14
hours per week for Michelle;  7 hours
per week to December 1990 and 14 hours
per week between January 1991 and June 1995 for Faith;  14 hours per week until
December 1991
and 28 hours per week thereafter for the twins.  Additionally
the figure of 240 hours in the schedule for Ms. Woolcock grew to 320
(8 hours
per week for 40 weeks of the year) on the plaintiff's evidence in chief, and to
416 hours per year in Mr. Capelin's closing
address.
<P>

165  	It was the submission of the defendants that the fall did not
give rise to any, or to any significant, need for domestic assistance.
It was
further submitted that the claim, as calculated upon the plaintiff's behalf,
and as summarised above, is grossly exaggerated
and fundamentally flawed
because:
<P>

(a)	the proper measure of damages is the commercial cost of replacing the
services performed by a person qualified to meet the needs,
not by a simple
multiplication out of the hours during which the children for example, may have
carried out domestic tasks over the
period in question;
<P>

(b)	due allowance must be made for the tasks the children would normally have
carried out, as an inevitable component in their progression
from infancy to
maturity, and
<P>

(c)	the incapacity claimed by the plaintiff to carry out domestic tasks was not
in accordance with the medical evidence, or with
the answers to the self
assessment questionnaires or history provided by her to the Pain Clinic.
<P>

166  	If the fall has given rise to a claim under this head of loss
then, it was submitted by the second defendant, the best measure
was provided
by reference to the work performed by Ms. Woolcock, of 240 hours per year (4.6
hours per week).  Extended over approximately
fourteen years since 6 January
1986, the loss would be 240 hours x 14 years x $12.5 = $42,000.  The first
defendant, however, submitted
that, subject to the causation issue, allowance
should be made at the rate of 14 hours per week over the period, i.e. 728 hours
x
14 years x $12.5 = $127,400.
<P>

167  	There is considerable force in the defendants' submission
concerning this head of claim.  I am satisfied that it is excessive
to a
considerable degree and fails to take into account the extent to which the
plaintiff's children, in particular, would have undertaken
activities about the
house whether or not the plaintiff was injured.  It also appears to me to
overstate the period during which
the children became significantly
involved.
<P>

168  	The claim can be tested by reference to a calculation of the
amount of hours per week which the total claim of $340,900 (as
presented in the
Schedule) represents.  Extended over a period of fourteen years in round terms
since the accident, the calculation
is $340,900  (14x52 weeks)  $12.5 per hour
= 37.46 hours per week.  This is, in my view, a considerable overstatement of
the plaintiff's
<i>needs, </i>even allowing for the demands of a large family.
The reasons for that conclusion, so far as they are based on principle and
fact,
follow.
<P>

169  	The plaintiff is entitled to damages for accident connected
needs relating  both to herself, and to the other members of her
family for
whom she would otherwise have performed domestic services:  <u>Sullivan v
Gordon</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/338.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA 338.</a>  However, I am of the view that no loss is
occasioned where chores performed or services provided by a parent, at the time
of the
injury, for a child or children, would in the ordinary currency of
family life and obligation, have been passed on to those children
as they
matured, and as they were properly encouraged in their own interests, to assume
some responsibility for their own care. Activities
undertaken, for example, in
looking after their own bedrooms, clothes, attending to their own toiletry,
preparing their own snacks,
looking after school related tasks, and the like,
fall into this category.
<P>

170  	The law has seen some shift in this respect since the decision
in <u>Kovac v Kovac</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20NSWLR%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 NSWLR 656</a> where Samuels JA said:
<P>

"If the principle confirmed in <u>Griffiths</u> is to be regarded as informed
by considerations of policy, as I think it must ... I do not believe that any
head of policy ... requires
the ordinary currency of family life and obligation
to be wholly ignored;  or the inclusion in the area of compensation of the
support
commonly expected and received amongst the members of a family
group...".
<P>

Although <u>Kovac</u> was applied in a large number of cases, e.g. <u>Burnicle
v Cutelli</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 26</a>; <u>Hood v GIO</u> (14 December 1988 - Sharpe
M, as he then was); <u>Mitchell v McDonald</u> (21 April; 1988 Studdert J at
20); <u>Attard v Fel</u> (1 June 1990 - Abadee AJ); <u>Rosniak v GIO</u> (14
December 1990 - Badgery-Parker J); <u>Lynch v GIO</u> (1 August 1991 - Grove
J), it was not always viewed favourably.  In <u>GIO v Planas</u> (NSWCA 14
November 1984 at 12-14), the Court doubted the extent of the so-called
<u>Kovac</u> `gloss' but declined to reconsider what was said there. See also
<u>Haines v Bendall</u> (NSWCA 22 February 1990 at 20) for the expression of a
similar sentiment.  Later, in <u>Trevali v Haddad</u> (NSWCA 16 November 1989),
Meagher JA (with whom Priestley and Mahoney JJA agreed) commented that
<u>Kovac</u> had no ratio, and establishes if anything only that there can be
no compensation if domestic services would have been furnished in
any event by
their provider.
<P>

171  	In 1992, the High Court in <u>Van Gervan v Fenton</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
175 CLR 327</a> expressed its disapproval of <u>Kovac</u> and similar decisions.
That case concerned an injured plaintiff who was receiving full-time care from
his wife, who gave up her job
following the accident. Mason CJ, Toohey and
McHugh JJ said:
<P>

"It does not seem reasonable that the defendant's liability to pay damages
should be reduced at the indirect expense of the provider
by invoking notions
of marital or family obligation to provide the services free of charge or at
less than market rates."  (at 335)
<P>

 
<P>

"In this case, the appellant's need is essentially for constant care and
attention. No doubt some of the services which are now
needed by the appellant
were provided for him by his wife before the accident. But with great respect
to those judges who have taken
the contrary view [referring to <u>Kovac</u> and
other cases], no allowance in favour of the respondent can be made for such
matters...If the defendant has created the need for
the services, that person
is not entitled to have the damages reduced because, before the accident, the
plaintiff elected to pay
for similar services or had the benefit of having them
performed gratuitously." (at 338)
<P>

But cf Brennan J at 340-341:
<P>

"I am in general agreement with what Mason CJ, Toohey and McHugh JJ have
written, subject to one qualifying factor that arises when
an injured plaintiff
and the person who provides care for him or her are living together as husband
and wife or in some other personal
and permanent relationship...it is
appropriate to omit from the list of services to be paid for by the defendant
some of the time
spent or some of the minor services rendered by the care
provider to the plaintiff where those services would have been provided
in any
event as an incident of an antecedent personal relationship between them,<i>
provided</i> the plaintiff is able to offer services to the care giver in
return."
<P>

172  	The NSW Court of Appeal has since acknowledged that
<u>Kovac</u> is no longer good law. See for example <u>Maley v Milne</u>
(NSWCA, 10 October 1994) and <u>Mitchell v GIO</u> (NSWCA, 19 February
1993).
<P>

173  	In <u>Kealy v Fairfield Hospital</u> (Supreme Court of New
South Wales, 18 April 1997) a case where  the plaintiff's husband took care of
her and her two daughters, who
were aged 16 and 13 years at the time of the
hearing (11 and 8 years at the time of the injury),  Dunford J observed (at
11),  in
a passage that has some relevance to the present case:
<P>

"The ordinary incidents of family life in this community are that the mother
commonly ensures the cleanliness of the children's
rooms with such assistance
as she can muster from the children and does their laundry and ironing...It is
impossible to divide some
functions, such as cooking meals and grocery
shopping...between the needs of the injured plaintiff and the needs of the
whole family;
but such activities do not include the making of beds of
teenagers and would not in the future include doing laundry or ironing for
children who had left school. 
<P>

174  	So far as this observation rested upon <u>Burnicle v
Cutelli</u>, it would no longer be good law.  However, as an observation that
recognises that older children would, in the ordinary course, look
after
themselves, it is consistent with the view that no relevant <i>need</i> exists
as a result of the accident that should now attract damages.
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

175  	Similarly, in <u>Nguyen v Nguyen</u> (1990)<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=169%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">169 CLR 245</a>,
a claim under the Queensland equivalent of <i>Lord Campbell's Act</i> was made
for loss of domestic services. The court acknowledged that a <u>Griffiths v
Kerkemeyer</u> assessment is different from a <i>Lord Campbell's Act</i>
assessment in that the former is based on need (at 264).  Nevertheless the
following passage in the judgment of Dawson, Toohey and
McHugh JJ (at 266) in
relation to recovery principles under the Act,  is  of some relevance:
<P>

"In some families, the children might reasonably have been expected in the
course of time to have taken up, to a greater or lesser
extent, the household
duties previously performed by a parent. In that event, the loss incurred by
reason of the death of that parent
is the less.  Of course, if the children
take up the household duties, not in the ordinary course of events, but only
because of
the death of the parent, that will not reduce the total loss and it
is irrelevant that the services do not need to be replaced by
someone outside
the household." 
<P>

176  	The plaintiff gave evidence to the effect that Ms Woolcock had
provided assistance for ten to eleven years, in relation to
heavy housework
like vacuuming, washing floors, cleaning bathrooms and ironing, and taking her
to medical appointments.  This work,
it would appear from the evidence of the
plaintiff and Ms. Woolcock, began in 1987 and continued until about 1998, and
occupied about
 eight hours per week.  Ms. Woolcock was remunerated at one
stage, for about three months, for three hours per week.  Otherwise she
was
unpaid.
<P>

177  	The plaintiff said that Mrs. Roberts also assisted with
ironing, particularly after her periods of hospitalisation, over a
period of
two years.  Further assistance, she said, was provided by Mrs. McGrath and Mrs.
Cordina, in relation to ironing and heavy
housework that was beyond her.  Mr.
Hanzic she said helped with some of the things that the friends mentioned had
not finished. 
Bianca she said did a lot of supervision in getting the other
children up and about, in cutting lunches, and cooking, a role that
Michelle
later took over.  A  roster was established under which they shared chores - a
procedure which is hardly unknown within
most families of any size.
<P>

178  	Julie Paino, she said, was now paid to give the house a
"thorough go-through" for two to three hours per week, at a rate of
$12.50 per
hour.
<P>

179  	The plaintiff said that all she could manage was light dusting,
organising, sorting washed clothes and the like, shopping
for groceries,
driving the children around, and similar activities which she could take her
time to complete.  She also acknowledged
that between 1986 and 1989, i.e.
before the symptoms began to progress to the serious extent that was evident
from 1991 onwards,
she was doing some of the work about the home, and even in
1991 she was "still reasonably active".
<P>

180  	It was from this time, upon advice of the Pain Clinic, that she
began to pace herself and arrange for the rest of the family
to take on more
responsibilities. Even so, as the self assessment sheets show, the plaintiff
was still doing a good deal of the vacuuming,
sweeping, bathroom cleaning,
driving  and other activities, at least until the end of 1991.
<P>

181  	Michelle Hanzic gave evidence that before the plaintiff's fall
the other children were expected to do some chores, including
vacuuming part of
the house, making their own beds, assisting with the shopping and doing a small
amount of light ironing.   After
the fall, they had to take over some of the
heavier work that their mother had previously done for them, including washing,
and ironing
at least those items for which there was a special need by one of
the children, and finishing off the vacuuming of the house.  She
confirmed that
the position with her mother was one of a slow decline, with her being on
occasions in obvious pain and distress and
unable to complete what she was
trying to do.  She also confirmed that her mother appeared to improve once she
received the morphine
pump, and that thereafter she was able to do more things
around the house.
<P>

182  	In accordance with the line of authority previously mentioned,
what is to be determined is the <i>need</i> of the plaintiff attributable to
the accident, excluding the household services which the remaining members of
the household might
reasonably have been expected to provide, had the accident
not occurred. A good deal of the contributions provided by the husband
and
children, in the present case appear to fall within this category. Moreover, if
it is to be compensated at an hourly rate, then
it would seem inappropriate to
provide a full hourly rate for services that were performed slowly by the
children because of their
inexperience or youth.  Adjustment needs to be made
for these matters,  as well as for the circumstance that the older children
(Bianca,
Faith and Michelle) had all left home by the beginning of 1996; for
the circumstance that the plaintiff has effectively been separated
from her
husband since about 1994, and for the further circumstance that she is now more
mobile.
<P>

183  	I propose to approach this part of the plaintiff's claim upon
the basis that the assistance provided by Ms Woolcock, and the
three other
friends (for limited periods) represent a minimum guide for a determination of
the plaintiff's needs, which should be
supplemented, to a reasonable extent, by
the additional contribution of the plaintiff's husband and her children.  The
need I accept
was not insignificant, particularly in the years between 1991 and
1995, having regard to the size of the family.   I assess damages
under this
head, accordingly, upon the basis of an average need, over the period, of 15
hours per week.  So calculated, the loss
is  $12.50 x 15 hours per week x 720
(13 years 11 months) = $135,000.
<P>

<b>Future Griffiths v Kirkemeyer</b>
<P>

184  	Somewhat inconsistently with its submission concerning the past
need,  which the second defendant confined to the services
provided by Ms
Woolcock, it submitted that the future loss should be calculated upon the basis
of eight hours per week, reduced by
50% for the contingencies of further
improvement in the plaintiff's condition, and the uncertainty as to her future
needs.  Extended
over a life expectancy of 35 years, the claim so calculated
would sound in a loss of $68,274 ($15 per hour x 8 hours x 1137.9) x
0.50 =
$68,274.  The first defendant, in a similar submission, invited assessment at
the rate of 7 hours per week, subject, however
to a discount of only 15%, i.e.
($15 per hour x 7 hours x 1137.9) x 0.85 = $101,558.
<P>

185  	The plaintiff, however, submitted that the loss should be
calculated upon the basis set out as follows (subject to correction
for what
appear to me to be some  incorrect multiplication in the schedule):
<P>

<u>Alison and Karen Hanzic</u>
<P>

1137.9 x 7 hours per week x $15 per hour = 		$119,479
<P>

<u>Eduard Hanzic</u>
<P>

1137.9 x 7 hours per week x $15 per hour = 		$119,479
<P>

<u>Julie Paino</u>
<P>

1137.9 x 2 hours per week x $12.50 per hour =	$28,447	
<P>

<u>Therese Johnson</u>
<P>

1137.9 x 2 hours per week x $12.50 per hour =	<u>$28,447</u>	
<P>

								       $295,852
<P>

186  	It is not readily apparent why different hourly rates were
suggested in the calculation.   This would seem to be an error,
in view of the
agreement between the parties that for the future a rate of $15 per hour was
reasonable.   Nor is it the case that
the children could be expected to provide
the services indefinitely.  It may be assumed, however, that the hours
suggested, and the
rates, were selected as a likely indicator of what would be
required for the future, by whomsoever it was provided.  Upon that basis,
the
plaintiff's claim assumes a continuing weekly need equivalent to 18 hours, or
just over 2.5 hours per day.  I am satisfied that
this is well beyond what is
required, in view of the plaintiff's present state, the change in her family
circumstances and the absence
of any more precise evidence as to the services
presently needed.  
<P>

187  	In my assessment, an ongoing need of eight  hours per week is
reasonable, which should not be subject to any further discount
for
contingencies.  Those relevant to age and usual vicissitudes are taken up in
the life tables.  Otherwise, it is reasonable to
expect that even though the
plaintiff may continue to improve, she will need to take some care for herself,
and avoid heavy work,
lest her problems be aggravated.  An ongoing cost of $15
per hour would not be unreasonable.
<P>

188  	Upon that basis I propose to allow eight hours per week for the
future, sounding in a loss of 1137.9 x 8 hours x $15 per week
= $136,548.
<P>

189  	Subject to adjustments for interest and for workers'
compensation receipts (for which the first defendant, but not the second
defendant, is entitled to an offset) the heads of damage I assess as
follows:
<P>

Past out of pocket expenses				$126,455
<P>

Future out of pocket expenses				$237,626
<P>

Past Diminution of Earning Capacity		&#180;	$129,629
<P>

Fox v Wood							   $3,653
<P>

Past Superannuation					   $3,400
<P>

	
<P>

Diminution of Future Earning Capacity			$100,760
<P>

Future Superannuation					  $9,500
<P>

General Damages						$200,000
<P>

Past Griffiths v Kirkemeyer					$135,000
<P>

Future Griffiths v Kirkemeyer				<u>$136,548</u>
<P>

								$1,082,571
<P>

190  	It was agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to interest on
the past losses as follows:
<P>

Griffiths v Kirkemeyer			2% per annum
<P>

	Past General Damages ($100,000)	2% per annum
<P>

	Past diminution of earning capacity	5% per annum
<P>

191  	I require the parties to bring in short minutes to reflect the
necessary interest calculations, after any offset for the workers'
compensation
receipts, and to give effect to the terms upon which the cross claims have been
settled.  I stand over any argument
as to costs until such time as that has
been done.
