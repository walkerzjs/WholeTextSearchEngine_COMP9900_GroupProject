<P>

<b>4161/95 -  LLOYD WILLIAM GRAY V AUSTRALIAN CANCER FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL
RESEARCH &amp; ORS;  ESTATE OF HAROLD BOARDMAN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>  Harold Boardman died on 28 October 1990. He made and
published his last will and testament on 5 December 1984.  Probate was granted
to the plaintiff on 11 February 1991.
<P>

2	As far as is relevant to this case, all that need be said about Mr Boardman
was that he was a builder and carpenter who diversified
into a building supply
business in the Manly Warringah area, and later moved up to Leura on the Blue
Mountains. He, however, amassed
a considerable sum of money and the evidence
discloses that at present there is about $3.337 million, less the costs of
these proceedings,
in the estate.
<P>

3	Mr Boardman's will is relatively simple in form. The evidence shows that he
had made an earlier will in 1979 and his wife Myra,
sometimes known as Mabs,
had made a similar will in 1979 by a now retired solicitor, Mr Whiting. Mr
Whiting gave evidence that in
both the 1979 wills he was instructed by Mr
Boardman that one of the beneficiaries was to be "The Cancer Research
Foundation". In
the will of 1984 those exact words are also used, the will
simply leaving 95 percent of the residue of Mr Boardman's estate to "The
Cancer
Research Foundation".
<P>

4	The plaintiff executor is a solicitor practising at Katoomba. After obtaining
probate he asked the Court what he should do about
distributing the 95 percent
share of the residue because he was unable to find any body or any institution
which had that name.
<P>

5	On 24 April 1995 I gave advice that he had no option but to commence the
present proceedings, and that such proceedings should
involve all possible
charities who could claim, on the one hand, and representatives of the next of
kin on the other.
<P>

6	These proceedings were commenced in 1995 following that advice, but it took
quite a considerable time to gather information about
the charities which might
be claimants and the next of kin.  The court papers show that the matter came
before Santow J in 1997,
and progress was reported.  The next mention was at
the end of 1998 when it was clear that even though it was possible that some
other person or entity could come out of the woodwork, nothing much more could
be done to ensure that all the charities and next
of kin were before the court
and the matter should accordingly be fixed for hearing. I then fixed it before
myself and it was heard
yesterday and today.
<P>

7	Accordingly, although a long period of time appears to have gone by since the
probate was granted in 1991, the problems have been
mainly in identifying the
parties rather than fault with the executor or the court.
<P>

8	The questions which arise for decision are really three, namely: (1) Are any,
and if so which, of the first, third or fourth defendants
the body identified
by the testator as his beneficiary?   (2)  If the answer to question 1 is no,
does the will show a general charitable
intention?  (3)  If the answer to
question 2 is yes, how should the fund be deployed for cy pres. I will deal
with each of those
questions in turn.
<P>

9	(1) 	The first question really falls into two parts:  (a) is there any body
exactly described;  and (b) is the term "The Cancer
Research Foundation" a
misdescription of any body?
<P>

10	There is no doubt at all that the prime duty of the Court is to construe the
will and, if at all possible, identify the beneficiary
whom the testator has
wished to benefit. The Court does not approach this sort of problem on the
basis of what is best for the community,
or how a person knowing of the facts
should leave his or her property.  It is one of our basic rights as Australians
to leave our
money as we think fit, provided we comply with our duties to those
dependent upon us, and it is up to the Court to ensure that the
wishes of
testators are carried out.
<P>

11	When a will has uncertainty again the Court goes to fairly considerable
lengths to see if it can work out who was the intended
beneficiary.  In cases
where there is no charity involved so that the uncertain share will fall into
intestacy, it has been said
that the Court should go to the length of
indicating that it is impossible to identify the beneficiary before saying that
the bequest
fails for uncertainty;  see for instance <b>R v Newman</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1967/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] VicRp 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20VR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967]
VR 201</a>, 203.  The rationale of this is the presumption against intestacy;   see
<b>Boys v Bradley</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1853/93.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1853] EngR 93</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281853%29%2010%20Hare%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1853) 10  Hare 389</a>, 397;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1853/93.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1853] EngR 93</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=68%20ER%20978" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">68 ER 978</a>, 982.  If there is a
general charitable intention, the principle does not apply to quite the same
extent.  However, it is still a
Court's primary duty to find out what the
testator meant if at all possible.
<P>

12	Although wills speak from the date of death, when one is looking at
questions of identity of the beneficiaries the court sits,
as it were, in the
armchair of the testator at the date of making his or her will and bears in
mind the circumstances that the testator
would have known at that date:
<b>Boyes v Cook</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2014%20Ch%20D%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 14 Ch D 53</a>,56. In the instant case it must be
remembered that the 1984 will was really a re- enactment in a different form of
the 1979 will
so one must also look back to what was in the testator's mind as
he sat in his notional armchair in 1979.
<P>

13	It is necessary then to look briefly at the three claimants. The first
defendant was incorporated on 18 June 1984 under the name
Australian Cancer
Foundation for Medical Research. It changed its name in the last four or five
years to Australian Cancer Research
Foundation. It was not in existence in
1979. The material shows that it was set up in early 1984 by a series of
prominent people
in the community and was gradually launched on to the
community in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Accordingly, it could not have been in the
testator's mind in 1979, nor probably even when he made his will in 1984.
<P>

14	The fourth defendant, the University of Sydney, has a group called The
Melanoma Foundation.  It was established by a resolution
of the University
Senate in November 1984. However, before gaining the status of a foundation by
virtue of the resolution of the
Senate, the group did exist and it had to do
certain work and put forward some proposals so that it could gain that
recognition.
 It did not, however, exist in 1979 and there is very grave doubt
as to whether in 1984 the testator would have been aware of its
existence. Its
name also is quite different to the name used in the will.
<P>

15	However, there was some evidence that the testator suffered from a form of
skin cancer in 1979, and there was a similar fund
at that time known as The
Bill White Cancer Research Fund or the Bill White Melanoma Research Fund.
However, as the fund seems to
have ceased at some date in the 1980s and the
fourth defendant is not its successor, it is of very little relevance when
considering
questions of identity.
<P>

16	The third defendant was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1955. It
existed as an unincorporated body from about 1952. It seems
to have been
referred to in the community generally simply as "The Cancer Council".  There
is some material before the Court in the
annual reports of The Cancer Council
from 1965 to 1967 that certain donations which it had received would be used as
the nucleus
of a cancer research foundation. The 1966/7 annual report notes
that $1.2 million of donations were given for "the Research Foundation".
 The
1984 annual report noted there were various foundations within the Cancer
Council of which some were devoted to research, but
this really does not take
the matter much further forward because most of the foundations seem to have,
at least in brackets, the
donor's name.
<P>

17	Whether there were some internal entries in the books of the third defendant
and reference in its published annual reports to
a cancer research foundation,
there is no material at all that would show that that information was widely
disseminated throughout
the community, or that the testator ever became aware
of it. Counsel for the other defendants say that the third defendant has never
been known in the community by the name of "The Cancer Research Foundation",
and that the highest the evidence goes is to say there
were some internal
reports which used that name, even though some of those reports were published
to the public
<P>

18	There are some cases in the books where a short name for the charity
concerned has been held sufficient.  A mild example is <b>Provost and Scholars
of Queen's College, Oxford v Sutton</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1842/399.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1842] EngR 399</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281842%29%2012%20Sim%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1842) 12 Sim 521</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=59%20ER%201233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">59 ER 1233</a>, where
the name of the corporation was as I have just stated for the plaintiff, but
the will referred to it as "Provost and Fellows
of Queen's College". A more far
reaching example is <b>Gerhady v South Australian Auxiliary for the British
&amp; Foreign Bible Society Inc (No 3) </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2044%20SASR%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 44 SASR 195</a> where the
testator used short expressions for beneficiaries such as "British &amp;
Foreign Bible Society" and "New Guinea Mission
Work" which Legoe J stated
referred to the first defendant whose full name I have given, and to the
Lutheran Church of Australia
Inc which performed New Guinea Mission Work.
<P>

19	However, it seems to me in all the circumstances that the submissions of the
defendants other than the third are correct; that
this was not a case where the
public generally or the testator would naturally refer to the third defendant
as The Cancer Research
Foundation.
<P>

20	Accordingly, in my view none of the bodies exactly meets the description,
nor are the words "The Cancer Research Foundation"
a misnomer of any existing
body.
<P>

21	(2) 	No one argues against the will showing a general charitable intent.
Accordingly, I need not discuss the question further.
<P>

22	(3) 	When a will shows a general charitable intent but for reason of
uncertainty or otherwise the testator's exact purpose cannot
be carried out,
the Court of  Equity orders that the trust be executed cy pres, ie, to use the
words of Isaacs J in <b>Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v
Adams</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1908] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%207%20CLR%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 7 CLR 100</a>, 125, the Court makes an order to "...carry out the
general paramount intention in some way as nearly as possible the same as that
which the testator has particularly indicated without which his intention
itself cannot be effectuated".  In other words, the Court
looks to see from the
will what was the testator's intention and what were the means which the
testator indicated should be used
to effectuate the intention (see <b>Phillips
v Roberts</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%202%20NSWLR%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 2 NSWLR 207</a> at 214 and 217) and then requires that the
fund be used in that way. In that manner the testator's intention to benefit
the charity
can be carried out in as nearly as possible a way to that which he
or she would have intended.  In working out the cy pres scheme
the Court has to
move away from construing what the testator said in it and work out how best to
effectuate his general charitable
intention.
<P>

23	Each of the three claimants is quite clearly a very worthy body involved in
valuable work in the community in connection with
cancer.  Each, however, is
different. There is very detailed evidence before the Court as to their
activities which it is unnecessary
to summarise in depth.  I will just give a
pen picture of each.
<P>

24	The first defendant, the Australian Cancer Foundation for Medical Research
represented by Mr Dempsey of counsel, concentrates
on making substantial
capital grants for the building of institutes and laboratories throughout
Australia where research can be carried
out. It considers that there is no
other national organisation which regularly supplies capital funding or
building refurbishment.
Research is a very costly business, as Professor Lykke
said, the cost of computerised research equipment is extraordinarily high
and
without such equipment Australian research workers are really working at bunsen
burner level.  Accordingly, the first defendant
makes large capital grants of
one million dollars or more in some cases so that laboratories can be fitted
out for research.
<P>

25	The third defendant, the New South Wales State Cancer Council, for whom Mr
DPF Officer QC and Mr J B Whittle appear, is the predominant
charity in the
cancer area generally.  However, its charter goes far beyond research. The
objects that are set out in the 1955 Act
which incorporated it do concentrate
on research aspects, both assisting research and co-ordinating the research of
others. But it
also has objects to assist in providing training in technical
matters relating to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, to foster
education
of the public with respect to cancer, to advise the Minister of any matter
relating to cancer, and to provide hospital
accommodation for the treatment of
sufferers of cancer.
<P>

26	The fourth defendant, represented by Mrs D Stewart of counsel, is a much
more focused body but its focus is on melanoma and skin
cancers.  It is, as I
have said, a part of the University of Sydney, but only some of its research
and other staff are paid by the
University of Sydney, others by the Area Health
Service, and yet others in other ways.
<P>

27	In a cy pres case it is necessary if possible to see what the testator had
in mind because unless one does that one cannot determine
what is as near as
possible to the scheme he had in mind.
<P>

28	In the instant case there are only four words to indicate what the testator
had in mind, The Cancer Research Foundation. I will
briefly consider each of
those words.
<P>

29	"The" connotes predominant or only, and the indication would seem to be that
the testator wanted all his money to go to one body.
<P>

30	"Cancer" would seem to be a very wide word referring to all types of
cancer.
<P>

31	"Research" is a wide word. Research may benefit the people of New South
Wales even though it takes place somewhere else in the
world. There was some
reference in the evidence that the first defendant stops the brain drain of
doctors from Australia by providing
laboratories in which they can research in
Australia and that whilst that brain drain is stopped its researchers are also
able to
operate and otherwise treat patients here in New South Wales.
<P>

32	The fourth defendant also says that although its prime focus is on melanoma
and skin cancers, that in fact may give the clue
to all cancers and accordingly
it is involved in research on cancer generally, even though it has this primary
focus. That is an
argument which I can understand and is true up to a point.
However, one always remembers that aspirin was discovered when the company
was
carrying out research into dye so there is a limit as to how far we can take
the concept of research.
<P>

33	"Foundation".  The word "foundation" normally connotes a body with funds
contributing, usually in a capital way, to the endowment
of educational or
charitable work.  It usually connotes a body that benefits other bodies rather
than doing work itself.  See <b>Re</b> <b>National Foundation of Diarrheal
Diseases </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%20164%20NYS%20%282d%29%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 164 NYS (2d) 177</a>, 178.
<P>

34	Putting those thoughts together of course, does not really get one very far.
There is no one research foundation that could be
called "The Foundation".  All
of the bodies are involved with cancer and with research. The first and fourth
defendants are foundations
without doubt. The third defendant is strictly not a
foundation but it has considerable involvement in doing what foundations do,
that is making capital and income grants available to others.
<P>

35	The Attorney General has a role in the community as the protector of
charities. He has appeared in that capacity by Mr Davies
of Senior Counsel and
has indicated that in his view the fund should be split into three parts, one
third going to the first defendant,
one third to the third defendant, and one
third to the fourth defendant. That is a solution that is not uncommon in
charity cases;
 see for instance <b>McCormack v Stevens</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%202%20NSWLR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 2 NSWLR 517</a>,
519 and cases there cited. The plaintiff executor and Mr Packer of counsel for
the next of kin agree this is the proper solution.
 However, the New South
Wales State Cancer Council puts that it would not be appropriate to make that
sort of order in the instant
case.  Mr Officer QC and Mr Whittle reminded me of
what I said in <b>Robinson v Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association</b> - 24
November 1986, unreported, where I indicated that where one found in a
particular area one predominant charity, then the sharing
equal principle
should not be implemented but that charity should take the lion's share.
<P>

36	However, this exception does not apply in the instant case because although
the third defendant is the predominant charity in
the area, it is not the
predominant research charity. Accordingly, in my view the <b>Robinson</b>
<b>case</b> is distinguishable.
<P>

37	There is then the suggestion that the fourth defendant should not share
equally because it focuses on a particular form of cancer
whereas the other
bodies involve themselves with cancer generally and the testator seems to be
focusing on cancer generally. I think
there are two answers to that.  The first
is that research into melanomas is research into cancer and the results of that
research
may benefit cancer sufferers generally.  Secondly, the evidence shows
that of all the bodies, the fourth defendant was one which
the testator
actually knew existed and some of his friends were acquainted with the work of
Professor McCarthy, who is the executive
director of the fourth defendant.  I
consider that any argument against the fourth defendant participating is
outweighed by these
other factors.
<P>

38	Accordingly, in my view the draft order I make is that the fund be
distributed equally between the three claimants.
<P>

39	Formally the appropriate orders would appear to be orders 1 to 3 in the
draft orders handed up by counsel for the Attorney General
which I will
initial, date and place with the paper.
<P>

(Counsel addressed on costs)
<P>

40	So far as costs are concerned, it is always a troublesome matter in charity
cases. Unfortunately the law is so complex that it
usually requires that the
Court be assisted by senior members of the Bar who deem to involve themselves
in a lot of research. The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act 1993</a> has fortunately removed a
lot of  similar trusts from the process and has allowed them to be dealt with
administratively, but where
there are large sums of money involved, such as in
this case, there is always going to be an expensive piece of litigation. That
is really the fault of the people who were involved in the preparation of the
will, either the testator or the draftsperson rather
than the charities or the
Court, and that is why in charity cases usually the costs of everybody who has
been reasonable about the
matter come out of the fund because in one sense the
testator has created the problem. On the other hand, the Court does not
encourage
people to be unreasonable or to be too greedy.
<P>

41	It has been put that because the next of kin conceded question 2 they should
not get any costs after the date of the concession.
However, it would appear
from the bar table that Mr Packer, when briefed, gave his clients very sensible
advice which probably cut
half a day off the hearing and I should not penalise
Mr Packer or his clients for acting in a very responsible way.
<P>

42	The other question is whether the third defendant, insisting on obtaining
the whole lot under question 1 outlined above acted
unreasonably and lengthened
the matter.  I do not think it did, or that, if it did, the costs were
materially increased.
<P>

43	Accordingly, the proper order is,   "4.   The costs of all parties be paid
out of the monies directed to The Cancer Research
Foundation on the indemnity
basis".   So far as the exhibits are concerned, order 5 is that the exhibits be
returned other than PX09
which should be retained in the court file.
<P>
