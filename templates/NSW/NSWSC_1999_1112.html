<b>2627/98 - BARBARA ANNE MORGAN v PUBLIC TRUSTEE OF NEW SOUTH WALES - ESTATE
OF ELLA ENID NILON</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in
respect of the estate of the late Ella Enid Nilon who died on 12 July 1997 aged
72 years.  The deceased was survived by the plaintiff
who is the daughter of
the deceased's sister. The deceased was also survived by three step children
being children of her husband,
Dudley Nilon from an earlier marriage.  They
have been notified of the proceedings, and make no claims so their interests
can be
disregarded.
<P>

2  	The deceased died intestate, and given the enquiries made by the
defendant administrator it is clear the proceeds pass to the
Crown as bona
vacantia..  There was reference in the affidavit evidence to the intention of
the step children to make application
to the Crown for payment out under s 61 B
(8) of the Wills Probate and Administration Act 1998.  However, having regard
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">20</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> it would be inappropriate to have
any regard to such intention. The estate has been reduced to cash and amounts
to $353,305.44. 
The defendant's costs amount to $10,000 and the plaintiff's
$47,000.  The distributable estate is thus in the order of $300,000.
<P>

3  	In order to set the background I will deal with some of the
history of the deceased and her family. The deceased, Ella Enid
Nilon was born
on 18 June 1925.  The plaintiff was born at the Royal Hospital for Women,
Paddington, New South Wales.  Her mother
was not married, and at that stage she
was residing with her grandmother at 211 Johnston Street, Annandale. The
deceased, Ella Nilon,
was a first cousin of the plaintiff's mother and was
residing nearby at 215 Johnston Street, Annandale.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff's mother in between March and September 1943
married and left Australia to reside in New Zealand with her husband.
The
plaintiff, her daughter, then commenced living at 215 Johnston Street,
Annandale in the care, custody and control of the deceased
and her parents.
<P>

5  	Some two years later the plaintiff's mother returned to Australia
following the death of her first husband. The plaintiff then
apparently left
215 Johnston Street to live at 211 Johnston Street, Annandale with her mother
and grandmother. Later in 1945 the
plaintiff commenced work as a live-in
housekeeper at Kirribilli.  Once again the plaintiff returned to live at 215
Johnston Street,
Annandale in the care, custody and control of the deceased.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff commenced primary school in February 1946 and about
this time the plaintiff's mother married for the  second time.
 A daughter was
born in 1948 of that second marriage, and at this stage the plaintiff was
living from time to time either with her
mother or with the deceased and her
parents at 215 Johnston Street.
<P>

7  	In 1949 the plaintiff's mother separated from the second husband,
and the plaintiff then moved back to her mother's place. 
In early 1950 the
plaintiff's mother obtained employment as a live-in domestic at High Street,
Kirribilli. She and her daughter Clare
moved to that address.  The plaintiff
did not accompany them, but returned to moving between 211 and 215 Johnston
Street, Annandale
where she was looked after alternately by her grandmother,
the deceased and her parents.
<P>

8  	In 1952 the plaintiff commenced her secondary education at
Riverside High School, and at this stage it was the deceased who
was making her
uniforms, paying the school fees, and matters of this nature.  Also in 1952 the
plaintiff's mother left home and moved
to a live-in position at Bankstown in
New South Wales.
<P>

9  	By 1956 the plaintiff had finished her secondary school education
and commenced working.  Once again she moved between 211 and
215 Johnston
Street, Annandale being looked after by either her grandmother at 211 or the
deceased at 215.
<P>

10  	In January 1961 the plaintiff married John Morgan and commenced
her family the following year. They moved to Bankstown in 1963
and in 1964 came
back to 211 Johnston Street in order to look after the plaintiff's ailing
grandmother.  In due course, a year later
in 1965 they moved to Seven Hills and
continued raising a family.
<P>

11  	It was in 1975 that the deceased married Dudley Nilon. The
contact between the plaintiff and the deceased at this stage lessened
but they
still maintained contact. During the following years there were visits by some
of the step children of the deceased to Australia
to visit the deceased's
husband.
<P>

12  	It was in 1995 that the plaintiff was first diagnosed with
breast cancer.  She had medical treatment both chemotherapy and
radiation. By
1996 it was in remission, and her treatment ceased at that stage.
<P>

13  	In March 1996 the deceased's husband Mr Nilon died, and
thereafter the association between the plaintiff and the deceased increased
to
the extent that the plaintiff and her husband would look after the deceased by
taking her on outings and keeping her company.
<P>

14  	In November 1996 the plaintiff's husband was retrenched from
employment at Otis as a result of work injuries and has not worked
since then.
The following year in various discussions the deceased indicated that she
proposed to leave her house to the plaintiff
and talked of making a will to
that effect.
<P>

15  	The deceased died on 12 July 1997 and thereafter a grant of
administration was taken out in due course and the proceedings
were commenced
within time. By August 1997 the plaintiff's breast cancer started to spread to
her lungs, and she has undergone further
treatment since then.
<P>

16  	For the plaintiff to be able to claim in that estate it is
necessary for her to be an eligible person, and in the present case
she will
only be an eligible person if she is  part of the household, and partly
dependent upon the deceased. There is no dispute
that she was part of the
household that comprised the deceased and the deceased's parents.
<P>

17  	Dependency also is conceded, and this is obvious from the
account which I have given of the plaintiff's movements to and from
215
Johnston Street.  Effectively the plaintiff was mothered by the deceased. There
was provision of clothes and the necessities
of life by the deceased.  This on
the evidence included the providing of food.
<P>

18  	It is clear that the plaintiff is an eligible person.  However
it is necessary under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> (1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> that the Court shall
first determine whether there are factors warranting the making of the
application.  This expression has been
dealt with by courts on a number of
occasions.  In <i>Re Fulop Deceased</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 679</a> at 681 McLelland J
described that expression in the following terms: 
<P>

"Secondly, the subsection appears to be premised upon a distinction between
'factors which warrant the making of the application'
on the one hand, and
circumstances which would justify the making of an order granting the
application, on the other;  otherwise
the subsection would be pointless.  This
means that in a particular case the Court might determine that there are
'factors which
warrant the making of the application' within the meaning of the
subsection, and yet go on to decide that the application should
fail.  Since
the subsection applies only to certain classes of applicants, it suggests that
those classes of applicants need to demonstrate
some basis for their claims
additional to that required of other classes.  The difference between the two
sets of classes of applicants,
in broad terms, seems to be that the classes not
affected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9(1)</a> (lawful and de facto spouses and children) are as such
generally regarded as natural objects of testamentary recognition by a deceased
(of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a>, s 61B), whereas the classes
affected by s 9(1) (former spouses, and some time dependent grandchildren or
household members) are
as such not generally so regarded.  This suggests that
the 'factors' referred to in the subsection are factors which when added to
facts which render the applicant an 'eligible person' give him or her status of
a person who would be generally regarded as a natural
object of testamentary
recognition by a deceased. That the subsection is directed at a plaintiff's
status as applicant in some such
sense as this perhaps finds some support in
the statutory direction to the Court, in the event that it determines the
preliminary
question adversely to the plaintiff, not to go on to determine the
application, but 'refuse to proceed with the determination of
the
application.'"
<P>

19  	In <i>Churton v Christian</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 241</a>, the Court
approved this statement.  Priestley JA at page 252 after setting out and
approving the statement added: 
<P>

"To this I would add that although the classes affected by s 9(1) are not
necessarily generally regarded as natural objects of testamentary
recognition,
in some cases members of those classes may, when the circumstances of their
relationship with the deceased are set out,
immediately be seen to be persons
who would be regarded by most observers as, in their particular circumstances,
natural objects
of testamentary recognition."
<P>

20  	These principles have been applied at first instance for many
years. There has been in recent times further attention to this
matter in the
Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Brown v Faggoter</i>, a decision given on 13
November 1998, which is a decision of Sheller JA, Sheppard AJA and Fitzgerald
AJA.  The main judgment was
given by Fitzgerald AJA, who seemed to suggest that
an application might be warranted if the application has reasonable prospects
of success.   This seems to be a somewhat different and perhaps easier test
than that which the Court of Appeal approved in <i>Churton v Christian</i>.  I
will consider the matter on both bases, given that there may be some flux in
the state of the law in this regard.
<P>

21  	There are a number of factors which would indicate factors
warranting in the traditional sense.  The first of these is that
the deceased
herself considered the plaintiff to be someone who was a person who should be
benefited under her will.  There were
the discussions in which the deceased
indicated to the plaintiff that she wished to leave the house to her.  It is
easy to accept
this evidence because in fact the deceased had said the same
thing to someone from outside the plaintiff's immediate household. 
In fact the
deceased had thought she had made the will, and had left the house to the
plaintiff.     
<P>

22  	The other matter is the fact that the deceased was a surrogate
mother for the plaintiff. The extent to which she was such a
mother has been
criticised in submissions because it has been pointed out, for instance, that
the deceased was only 15 at the time
the plaintiff was born.  Clearly the major
part of the care of the  plaintiff which the deceased undertook would have
commenced when
the deceased was 17.  At that stage she had left school and was
in employment and earning funds.  Although not a lot it was no doubt
sufficient
for her to provide for the plaintiff.
<P>

23  	The other people who were in the household at that stage were
the deceased's parents.  I think they on the evidence lived there
until 1954
and 1959 respectively, and they no doubt provided the accommodation.  However,
for a substantial period when the plaintiff
did come back to 215 Johnston
Street she was looked after by the deceased.
<P>

24  	By 1959 the deceased was going out with her future husband.  For
some time prior to that she had been travelling. The relevant
period is when
the plaintiff was a young girl and growing up.  
<P>

25  	The deceased herself had no children and apparently may not have
been able to have children.  There is evidence that shows
the deceased being
closely involved on a day to day basis with the upbringing of the plaintiff.
This included changing nappies, looking
after her, making clothes, providing
school fees and all manner of things that are necessary with a young child.
<P>

26  	The deceased during this time used to like taking the plaintiff
on trips and this is in evidence in photographs. The contact
the plaintiff had
with the deceased in later years after the death of the deceased's husband also
indicates the reality of the earlier
relationship.  There clearly was a close
relationship between them. In my view given this relationship, the factors
warranting in
what I might describe a more traditional approach are certainly
present. I will consider whether or not the plaintiff has prospects
of success
in the following analysis, and I do come to the conclusion that there are good
prospects for her success. Accordingly,
I am satisfied there are the
appropriate factors warranting under s 9(1) of the Act.
<P>

27  	In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High Court
has recently in Singer v Berghouse <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two stage
approach that a Court must take.  At page 209 it said the following: 
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance education
and advancement in
life?  The difference between adequate and proper and the interrelationship
which exists between adequate provision
and proper maintenance etc were
explained in Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited.  The determination of the
first stage in the two-stage
process calls for an assessment of whether the
provision (if any) made was inadequate or what, in all the circumstances, was
the
proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for the applicant having
regard, amongst other things, to the applicant's financial position,
the size
and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship between
the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and
other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like Ellis v Leeder where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made
and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements to pay creditors."
<P>

28  	I turn to the plaintiff's situation, she is 59 years of age,
married and has five adult children. Her financial situation is
that she and
her husband have a home worth $150,000; have furniture worth $4,000 and a
vehicle worth about $6,000. Her husband has
savings left over from his
redundancy and worker's compensation claim of about $12,500. Because both are
on pensions their combined
income is about $360 per week and their expenses are
in the order of $506 per week.  This leaves a shortfall of $146 per week.

<P>

29  	The plaintiff's medical situation is something to which I have
earlier referred.  She has had breast cancer which in 1996 went
into remission.
In her report of the 13 October 1999 Dr Ahern refers to the treatment of the
plaintiff.  She refers to the further
occurrence of cancer in the right breast
in August of 1997.  This apparently had spread to the lung and the development
of lung cancer
apparently made the cancer incurable.  She is on a number of
treatments which stabilise her condition, and these treatments change
from time
to time. She recently had in April this year some further radiotherapy.
<P>

     
<P>

30  	Dr Ahern comments that Mrs Morgan has remained without further
progression of her breast cancer, and her disease is quite stable,
however will
never rid Mrs Morgan of breast cancer.  Dr Ahern went on to say in the report,
Exhibit "B":-
<P>

"Mrs Morgan has specifically requested on more than one occasion that life
expectancy not be discussed with her.  I can simply reiterate
that at present
Mrs Morgan's disease is quite stable.  Mrs Morgan is taking a variety of
alternative medicines. These are not medications
that I have prescribed; Mrs
Morgan knows that I do not believe that there is any specific evidence that
these medications will be
helpful to her condition.  However there is no
evidence that they are harming her.  I am unable to provide an estimate as to
the
cost of these medications.".
<P>

31  	Mrs Morgan's husband also has medical problems. These resulted
from accidents he has had at work, and presently he is unfit
for work which
involves any lifting or frequent bending.  Accordingly he is on a disability
pension.
<P>

32  	It is necessary for the Court if it is to make an order to see
how the plaintiff has been left without proper and adequate
provision for her
maintenance, education and advancement in life.  In the present case the
plaintiff advances both her lack of funds
for her maintenance and also matters
affecting her advancement in life.
<P>

33  	So far as maintenance is concerned she has a shortfall in income
of $146 per week.  However, it is very hard for the Court
to quantify the sum
which would be sufficient for her to make up this short fall. This is because
there is simply no evidence, because
the plaintiff does not wish to know of the
matter, to determine her life expectancy.
<P>

34  	The Court cannot speculate, but clearly though the lady has
cancer which is now said to be incurable and her life expectancy
would not be
that of an ordinary member of the public in good health.    
<P>

35  	Accordingly, the Court has to provide something which will
assist for some period in this regard. However, it cannot do it
on any accurate
basis.
<P>

36  	The second area which concerns the advancement in life of the
plaintiff involved a number of different areas.  There were firstly
repairs to
the house which the plaintiff and her husband would like to undertake. Repairs
to a kitchen to replace it with a new one,
costing some 15 to $20,000, painting
internally of $4,000, and the cost of renovating a bathroom.  This latter item
is something
obviously less than the $15,000 advanced in evidence which was
conceded to be far too generous. Perhaps something in the order of
$5,000 might
be more appropriate.
<P>

     
<P>

37  	These matters I think are appropriate ones which can be
considered by the Court. There is also the problem they have with the
garden.
It needs some landscaping, an amount of some $5,000, but whether that is
necessary it is difficult to determine.
<P>

      
<P>

38  	The plaintiff's husband has difficulty doing the gardening work
and obviously the plaintiff herself has the same problem. 
Things such as
putting out washing caused her to injure herself because of her condition.  An
amount of $100 per fortnight would
allow someone to do the gardening and mow
lawns.     
<P>

39  	Another area which has been advanced is the question of
replacement of furniture and white goods in the house.  The lounge
needs
replacing at some $2,000 to $3,000.  It is suggested $5,000 is needed for
kitchen equipment and that the carpets and blinds
might need replacing at
$15,000.
<P>

     
<P>

40  	Another area put forward is the additional treatment which is
necessary for the plaintiff's medical condition.  Acupuncture
at $150 to $200 a
week apparently would assist and has been of assistance in the past. There are
also herbal medications which the
plaintiff wishes to take, which she should
not be precluded from taking, at a cost of some $75 per week.
<P>

     
<P>

41  	The final area advanced was the need to replace the car.  It is
in fact the plaintiff's husband's car.  In one sense therefore
it is not
appropriate, but no doubt it is used to take the plaintiff to appointments and
thus may be an appropriate matter to consider.
 They wish to purchase a car for
about $30,000, and they will trade in their present car for about $6,000. If
one looks at all these
items, there is an element of giving evidence of every
conceivable matter which the plaintiff and her husband would like to do to
the
house.  Some of them may not really be necessary.  There are figures in the
order of $8,000 or $9,000 per annum for the medication,
health matters, and
gardening.
<P>

     
<P>

42  	It is also, of course, important in these matters to have regard
to the position of any other person who has a claim on the
bounty of the
deceased.  In this case there is none as the estate will pass to the Crown.
<P>

     
<P>

43  	The question of what is an appropriate provision in respect of a
large estate was dealt with by Young J in <i>Anasson v Phillips</i>, 4 March
1988, where he said the following: 
<P>

"With a very large estate... there is a great temptation on a court to be
over-generous with other people's money. This is especially
so when the court
can see that plaintiffs have been very hardly done by at the hands of a
domineering testatrix.  However, the case
should not be approached in this way
as the application has to be determined in accordance with the legal
principles. These principles
include the fact that in Australia there is
freedom of a person to leave her property in whatever way she wishes, to love
whom she
wishes, to hate whom she wishes and there is only when there has been
a failure to comply with a moral duty to those who in the community's
eyes she
should have made proper provision for, that anyone can legally complain about
another person's will.  Even then, the court
has no power to re-write the will,
but can only adjust things, in substitution for the testatrix, in such a way as
to fulfil her
moral duty.
<P>

If the estate is a large one, the court has a slightly different approach.  The
basic principles are the same, that is, the will
can only be affected to the
extent that it is necessary to discharge the moral duty by making adequate
provision for the plaintiffs,
but where there is a large  estate, competition
between claimant and claimant, and claimant and beneficiary under the will is
much
reduced or eliminated. Further, there may be a more liberal assessment of
the moral duty owed, to be reflected in what is proper
provision for the
plaintiffs.  In particular, the lifestyle that has been enjoyed by the
plaintiffs, because they have been associated
with a wealthy testatrix is a
relevant factor.  These principles all, I think, flow from cases such as Re
Buckland  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20VR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) VR 404</a>, especially at page 412."
<P>

     
<P>

44  	Although I would not describe this as a large estate it is an
estate where there are no competing claims, and accordingly perhaps
one can be
a little more generous.
<P>

     
<P>

45  	The plaintiff is in a delicate state with her health.  To not
have to worry about spending on her health, and to have appropriate
surroundings is quite a reasonable request on the plaintiff's behalf, and
accordingly there should be some reasonably generous provision
in favour of the
plaintiff.
<P>

     
<P>

46  	However the difficulty the court has is that the court cannot,
because of the lack of evidence, speculate about matters and
can only provide
what is appropriate given the evidence. Doing the best I can and noting the
lack of evidence on the major matter
to do with the life expectancy of the
plaintiff, I think it is appropriate there be a legacy for the plaintiff of
$185,000, and I
so order.
<P>

     
<P>

47  	I order that the plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis,
and the defendant's on an indemnity basis be retained or paid
 out of the
estate of the deceased.  I order that the exhibits be returned.
