<b>JUDGMENT  (On claim for privilege on document produced in answer to
NP5<i>)</i></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In response to a Notice to Produce dated 19 March 1999 and
identified in this application as NP5, the defendant produced
in answer to
paragraph 5(a) a document which will be MFI 8.  The document, like the document
with which I was concerned in dealing
with MFIs 5 and 6 (in relation to NP6),
has clearly the following characteristics: (1) it is a photocopy; (2) there has
been obliterated
other material from it and (3) it is, to a very great extent,
illegible.  The last characteristic can be solved.  
<P>

2	The document in fact produced, namely the photocopy read: <i>"11/11/98 ATN7 -
Marsdens 3.45pm x Greg Quail re his earlier call; (2) he picked up D13 at
Quakers Hill, met Woodhouse at a coffee
bar in Hyde Park</i>". 
<P>

3	Paragraph 5(a) of NP5 requires the production of documents recording or
making any note of the identity of the person referred
to as "<i>another
person</i>" in paragraph 3(c) of Mr Angus' affidavit of 8 February this year.

<P>

4	The affidavit of 8 February this year elaborates to some extent upon an
earlier affidavit by Mr Angus sworn on 4 February.  In
the latter affidavit in
paragraph 4 there is reference to a telephone conversation between Mr Angus and
Mr Quail in which, amongst
other things, there is attributed to Mr Quail the
following quote: "<i>I picked up D13 and we met with another person at a coffee
bar in Hyde Park."</i>
<P>

5	In the affidavit of 8 February Mr Angus deposes to the fact that Mr Quail
identified to Mr Angus the "<i>other person</i>".  Bearing that in mind and the
text of the photocopy produced, it can be seen that the photocopy produced
purports to be a document
recording a note of the identity of the person
referred to as "<i>another person</i>", the indications being that that person
is Mr Woodhouse.  
<P>

6	The photocopy document produced, which I have indicated will be marked MFI 8,
as I have said on its face is edited.  The document
from which it has been
edited will be marked MFI 7 and it will be accompanied by a handwritten
transcript of the original of MFI
7.  It is in respect of the balance of MFI 7
that a claim for privilege is made by the defendant.
<P>

7	The plaintiff has contended, as was contended in relation to NP6, that the
balance, shortly stated, is required to give meaning
to that which has in fact
been disclosed.  Again, in the case of NP5 I am not persuaded as to the
availability of that contention,
particularly in the light of the
"<i>tracking"</i> exercise that leads to the terms of paragraph 5(a) in NP5.

<P>

8	The other material on its face clearly is privileged and no basis has been
made for that privilege to be lost by reference to
any clarification
requirement in respect of that which has been disclosed. 
<P>

9	Accordingly, the application by the defendant to sustain privilege as to the
balance of the document produced on call is upheld.
