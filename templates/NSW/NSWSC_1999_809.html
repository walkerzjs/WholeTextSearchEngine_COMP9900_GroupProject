<b>3729/93	KATHRYN LYNNE PEARCE v ALLAN LESLIE McCUDDEN</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b> - Allowing plaintiff's application to lead further evidence
(see T31)
<P>

 
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	There is tendered a report of Mr Brian Davis of Davis &amp;
Stewart, Certified Practising Accountants.  The report is dated
28 July 1999.
The report values shares in a company called Quintaz Pty Limited which is now
the owner of businesses which originally
were started by the plaintiff and the
defendant during their de facto relationship.  It does own another business,
the initiation
of which was subsequent to the termination of any relationship
between the plaintiff and the defendant.  There is also some evidence
that the
property at Kurri Kurri, in which at least one of the businesses is conducted,
has been extended in some substantial way
since the plaintiff's departure from
the scene.  Whilst it is by reference to the company's shares rather than the
actual businesses
themselves that Mr Davis makes a valuation, he has, in
producing a value, made an allowance for the subsequently commenced business.
In relation to the land and buildings, he has not specifically allowed for the
building improvements, saying only that "it is expected
that the current value
for Land and Buildings would be more than that reflected in the Accounts".
<P>

2   	Three objections are taken by Mr Errington, of counsel for
the defendant, to this report.  First, it is said that it is a valuation
of
something irrelevant, namely, shares in a company which was not on the scene
when the plaintiff and the defendant were together.
 Secondly, he says that the
evidence as to the value of any assets as at today, as opposed to their value
as at the date of termination
of the relationship, is totally irrelevant.
Thirdly, he complains about the late service of this report, despite directions
as to
the service of affidavits and witness statements, and a direction that
all evidence in chief in the case be by affidavit or witness
statement.  This
document was first communicated to the defendant by being delivered to Mr
Errington's chambers last evening.
<P>

3   	As to the first objection, in the light of the fact that Mr
Davis attempts to dissect out the relevant businesses, the valuation,
even if
technically of company shares, does convey an opinion as to the value of the
businesses today, and I do not think the first
objection is well founded.  I
should say in that regard, however, that the report may not prove in the end to
be of great utility
unless something more is heard in evidence about the
improvements to the real estate and any difference in value effected by those
improvements, which the plaintiff avowedly did not contribute to in any
way.
<P>

4   	As to the second objection, it is part of the plaintiff's
case that the value of assets as at today is material to the orders
that I
shall make.  Both counsel agree that that is a matter of legal contention and
that the law is not entirely clear on this matter.
 As the value today is
relevant to a case sought to be made out and which will be dealt with in final
submissions, it seems to me
that evidence as to this issue should be in, and in
my view this evidence is relevant in the requisite sense.  If, as a result of
final submissions, I come to the view that evidence of value as at the present
day cannot be taken into account, then, of course,
this evidence will be
disregarded.  I therefore overrule the first and second objections taken to the
material and rule that it is
inherently admissible.
<P>

5   	So far as the third objection is concerned, it is certainly
regrettable that the material has been brought forward so late.
 Various things
have been said from the bar table as to the cause of this.  Evidence about
those matters is not before me, and it
is not appropriate that I come to any
conclusion, or say anything, about them at this stage, save that, for whatever
reason, the
evidence is brought forward deplorably late.  There is no
suggestion from what has been said on either side that it is the plaintiff's
personal fault that this is so.  Certainly if evidence on this issue is
pursued, it is likely that the case will not finish tomorrow,
being the last
day of the fixture made for it.  I have already indicated that the state of my
list will not permit the matter to
be resumed this year and, if it does not
finish tomorrow, it will be stood over to days to be fixed next year.  Mr
Errington responds
to that by saying that the case would finish tomorrow, if
this issue were not litigated, but I am far from certain that that is so.
However, whether it is or not, in all the circumstances I think it is
appropriate to permit this evidence in, although brought forward
late; no
irremediable prejudice has been put forward:  see <b>State of Queensland v J L
Holdings Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146.</a>  The grant of leave may have
consequences in a special order for costs depending on how the proceedings are
finally determined and
depending, perhaps, on further evidence, if necessary,
as to reasons for the matter being brought forward so late.
<P>

6   	The result is that I propose to grant leave for the
admission of the report into evidence but all questions of costs arising
from
the report being brought forward at a late time will be reserved.  The report
is admitted into evidence.
