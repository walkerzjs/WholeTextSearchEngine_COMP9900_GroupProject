ORS</u></center>
<P>


<P>

<center><u>JUDGMENT</u></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In these proceedings, damages are sought for
nuisance or negligence in the circumstance that weedicide, which
was sprayed by
air onto one property, drifted onto and severely damaged two vineyards on an
adjoining property.
<P>

2   		The first and second plaintiffs, Jure and Eva Bonic, were
the owners of the damaged property "Billabong" near Jerilderie in
the Murray
Irrigation Area. They had acquired the property of approximately 350 acres in
1970 when it was used for cropping and for
the carrying of stock. Jure and Eva
Bonic had come to Australia from Croatia and had a knowledge of the cultivation
of vineyards
in that country. They and the other plaintiffs, their sons John
and Frank, had it in mind to develop "Billabong" progressively as
a vineyard.

<P>

3   		The first development for this purpose occurred in 1977
when an area of forty acres was planted with Semillon, Trebiano and
Rhine
Reisling white wine vines and also a small number of Cabernet Sauvignon red
wine vines. By 1980,  Vineyard 1 was producing
grapes in commercial quantities
and by 1982 it was in full production. Vineyard 2, an area of 100 acres, was
planted out with cuttings
in about October 1989, just before the spraying
occurred. The wines planted included Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc,
Cabernet,
Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc varieties, as well as cuttings from
Vineyard 1. At that time it was the family's intention to commence
the
production of bulk wine on the property. A company, Capital Wines Pty Ltd, was
established for this purpose in 1991. The plaintiffs
also had it in mind that
at an appropriate time they would plant out the remaining available land on
"Billabong", which was a large
paddock to the north of Vineyard 2. By 1987,
that land had been levelled and graded with a slope appropriate for flood
irrigation.
<P>

4   		The first defendant, Fieldair (Deniliquin) Pty Limited,
was the company which contracted to undertake the aerial spraying.
The second
defendant, John Herschfelder, was the pilot of the aircraft. Both of these
defendants entered an appearance and filed
a defence but the Court was advised
that, due to financial difficulties, they would not appear at the hearing. 
<P>

5   		Rendell Nominees Pty Limited was the owner of the property
on which the spraying occurred. An order for the winding up of
the company was
made on 16 October 1990 but later, on  20 November 1992, a judge of the Court,
Lee J, granted leave to proceed. Malcolm
Rendell, the fourth defendant was the
managing director of Rendell Nominees Pty Limited. He lived on the property and
organised for
the spraying to occur. Neither Rendell Nominees Pty Limited nor
Mr Rendell entered an appearance or defended the proceedings although
they were
served with the initiating process and later with the statement of claim.
<P>

6   		The fifth defendant, Rhone Poulenc Rural Australia Pty
Limited, and the sixth defendant, Nufarm Limited, were the manufacturers
of the
weedicide which was sprayed on the Rendell property. They were joined as
parties on an allegation that the labelling on their
respective products was
inadequate and misleading. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth) was
relied upon. The claims against these defendants were settled shortly prior to
the commencement of the trial and, by consent,
I made an order dismissing the
claims against them. 
<P>

7   		The matter proceeded against the first four defendants on
an undefended basis. Mr J. Ireland QC, with him Mr D. Robertson
of counsel,
appeared for the plaintiffs.
<P>

8   		In his submissions to the Court, Mr Ireland relied
principally upon the tort of nuisance, alleging that the plaintiffs,
particularly
Jure, Eva and John Bonic, had an interest in the property
"Billabong" when the aerial spraying occurred and that their property and
their
use and enjoyment of it were harmed by the events which occurred. Mr Ireland
did not however abandon reliance upon the tort
of negligence.
<P>

9   		In my view, the matter should be considered under the
ordinary principles of negligence. Before the decision of the High Court
of
Australia in <i>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
179 CLR 520</a>, proceedings of this type could have been couched in terms of the
tort of nuisance, under the special rule expounded in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>
(1868) LR 3HL 330 or under the principles of negligence which have developed
since <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 100</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC 562</a>, as indeed it was expressed in
the statement of claim. 
<P>

10   		The rule in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i> was expressed in
the judgment of Blackburn J in the Court of Exchequer Chamber in <i>Fletcher v
Rylands</i> (1866) LR 1 EX265 where his Lordship said at 279-280:
<P>

"<i>the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and
keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes,
must keep it in at
his peril, and, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the
damage which is the natural consequence
of its escape. He can excuse himself by
shewing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff's default; or perhaps that
the escape
was a consequence of a vis major, or the act of God; but as nothing
of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary to inquire what excuse
would be
sufficient.</i>"
<P>

That rule would have encompassed the spraying operation which we are now
considering. In <i>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
179 CLR 520</a> at 549, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; said:
<P>

"<i>[We] shall assume that the rule extends to the introduction or retention of
any dangerous substance or the carrying out of any dangerous
activity upon or
within property under the occupation or control of the defendant.</i>"
<P>

11   		In <i>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty
Limited</i>, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, Brennan and McHugh
JJ dissenting, held that such issues should now be considered
under the
ordinary principles of negligence. At 556, the majority said: 
<P>

"<i>The rule in </i>Rylands v Fletcher<i>, with all its difficulties,
uncertainties, qualifications and exceptions, should now be seen for the
purposes of the common law of
this country, as absorbed by the principles of
ordinary negligence.</i>"
<P>

In the course of their reasoning, at 556, the majority expressed the
qualification that there may remain cases in which it is preferable
to see a
defendant's liability in a <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i> situation as lying in
nuisance or even trespass and not in negligence. But subject to that
qualification, the majority considered
that the type of situation with which we
are concerned in this present case should be dealt with according to the
ordinary principles
of negligence. At 549, the majority mentioned that:
<P>

"...<i> the editors of the last five editions of </i>Winfield and Jolowicz on
Tort<i> have expressed the view that, putting to one side the factual
situations in which a plaintiff will succeed equally well either under
the rule
or in nuisance, `</i>[w]e have virtually reached the position where a defendant
will not be considered liable when he would not be liable according to
the
ordinary principles of negligence'<i>. A similar view has been expressed by
other distinguished academic writers.</i>"
<P>

12   		The present is not a case where it would be appropriate
to look at the defendants' liability under the principles of nuisance
rather
than those of negligence. The principles of negligence are entirely apposite to
the situation, there having been an unintended
harm to the Bonics' property
arising from a one-off circumstance, namely the application of a dangerous
weedicide to the Rendell
property. The principles of nuisance, insofar as they
are different from those of negligence, are more appropriate to cases of
intentional
harm and to cases where damages or an injunction are sought in
relation to an ongoing situation where issues of an environmental
nature have
to be considered. In nuisance, the issues may take into account many objective
factors, whether the defendants' conduct
accorded with the ordinary practices
of mankind, whether the nuisance complained of was an ordinary use of the
defendants' land,
whether the alleged nuisance, the noise, smell or dust etc,
was an inevitable consequence of life in a crowded society, whether the
defendants' conduct though harmful to another was nevertheless conduct which
was of benefit to the community. See <i>Winfield v Jolowicz on Tort</i>, 14th
ed, 405-412. These different principles continue to have application, but, in
my opinion, they are not appropriate tests of
a situation such as the present
where the encroachment on the plaintiffs' land and the harm occasioned to it
was unintended and where
the issue is whether the defendants are liable for
permitting a dangerous substance to escape. Accordingly, it is to the issue of
negligence that I turn first. 
<P>

13   		The weedicide used in the spraying of the Rendell
property was designed to eliminate broad leaved weeds. The Rhone Poulenc
product was 2, 4-D Amine 500, the warnings on the label of which showed that it
could be harmful to humans, livestock, trees, plants,
crops and life. The label
stated, inter alia: 
<P>

"<i>Avoid spray drift. Spray drift can travel great distances. Do not use
product in close proximity to COTTON, GRAPES, TOMATOES, BANANAS
or other
susceptible crops, flower plants, ornamentals or fruit trees. DO NOT SPRAY ON
WINDY DAYS.</i>"
<P>

The Nufarm product, Amicide 500, the active ingredient of which also was 2,
4-D,  was likewise directed at broad leaved weeds. The
label contained like
warnings of harmful effects including a warning of which the copy in evidence
discloses only: 
<P>

"<i>Drift Warning: Avoid spray drift on to susceptible ... such as cotton,
tobacco, tomatoes, vines, fruit trees ... legume crops and
pastures, oil seed
crops ... susceptible trees (eg. Kurrajongs, Belahs).</i>"
<P>

Both labels gave instructions as to first aid should poisoning occur and
provided emergency numbers.
<P>

14   		It seems that Rendell Nominees Pty Limited had been
requested by its banker to spray the land so as to eradicate the weeds
thereon
and to enhance the capital value of the property.
<P>

15   		The south west corner of "Billabong" and the north east
corner of the Rendell property adjoined, being separated only by
a roadway.
Vineyard 1 on "Billabong" went down to that corner. The distance between the
nearest portion of the sprayed paddock on
the Rendell land and the nearest
portion of "Billabong" was about 300 metres. The distance to the farthest part
of vineyard 2 was
well over one kilometre. The sprayed paddock was 600 acres or
240 hectares in size, running in an east-west direction.
<P>

16   		Records of the first defendant and of the pilot, John
Herschfelder, show that Mr Herschfelder had been an agricultural pilot
for
thirty-three years and was engaged by Fieldair (Deniliquin) Pty Limited to
spray the 600 acre paddock which was infested with
thistles. Mr Herschfelder
sprayed on 12 November 1989 using a  Piper Pawnee Brave aeroplane fitted with
Micronair nozzles, the blades
of which were set at an angle of thirty-five
degrees. Mr Herschfelder commenced spraying at 16.50 pm at a time when the wind
direction
was 150 degrees, with a light wind blowing at about two knots or 3.6
kilometres per hour. The temperature was twenty-five degrees
Celsius. The plane
flew at a height of approximately six to eight feet above the ground. To check
the wind direction, Mr Herschfelder
arranged for Mr Rendell to light fires in
some old tyres. These were set near the north-east boundary of the paddock.
Probably, Mr
Herschfelder flew in an east-west line along the length of the
paddock. After the second load, Mr Herschfelder found that the wind
had swung
to due south. He stopped operations until the wind changed back to
approximately 150 degrees. Mr Herschfelder concluded
spraying at 19.50 pm.
During the spraying he used 480 litres of the weedicide, that is two litres per
hectare, which was within the
recommended limit of up to four litres per
hectare.
<P>

17   		The wind was blowing from a direction of 150 degrees,
that is thirty degrees to the east of due south, approximately
south-south-east.
The south-west corner of "Billabong" adjoined the north-east
corner of the Rendell property, while the eastern boundary of the Rendell
property ran northerly on a line with much of the western boundary of
"Billabong". The general run of "Billabong", from its south-west
corner to its
north-east corner, was about twenty-five degrees to the east of the northerly
line. 
<P>

18   		There must have been a wind shift after the spraying
concluded, as had occurred earlier during the spraying, for at about
10 pm that
evening the plaintiffs noticed the strong and distinctive odour of the
chemical, and this continued at least until they
retired to bed at about 11 pm.
They had to shut the windows of their residence in order to exclude the
smell.
<P>

19   		On the following day, Monday 13 November 1989, the
plaintiffs noticed that their vines had been affected particularly those
vines
closest to the Rendell property. Over the ensuing days and weeks the harm to
the property became more and more apparent. The
vines on Vineyard 1 were badly
affected although the damage was a little patchy. The Cabernet vines appeared
to suffer a little less
than the others. The newly planted vines on Vineyard 2
died. Roses and other plants in the Bonic's garden suffered from the spray
and
a number of fruit and nut trees were badly affected. Some persimmon trees died.
Many of the walnut trees, particularly those
nearest the Rendell land, became
stunted and failed to grow and produce nuts as previously they had done. 
<P>

20   		The land at "Billabong" was inspected by Mr Rendell and
by persons acting in his interests and those of Fieldair (Deniliquin)
Pty
Limited and also by officers from the Department of Agriculture NSW. The
plaintiffs engaged an expert, Mr D.N.M. Hutchins, who
was an agricultural
consultant trading as Hutchins Agronomic Services and who had had experience
with this type of problem. Mr Hutchins
inspected "Billabong" on 22 December
1989 after having first inspected a neighbouring property "Canarney Farms" to
the west of Billabong
Creek, which also had suffered damage to its sugar beet,
roses, fruit and nut trees and other plants as a result of the aerial spraying
on the Rendell property.
<P>

21   		Mr Hutchins found that the grapevines on "Billabong" were
suffering from epinasty, leaf distortion with the leaves having
a hard,
leathery appearance, chlorosis of new growth, fan shaped leaves and prominent
veins on new growth, twisting and distortion
of new growth, some shoot
necrosis, grape bunches twisted, bunch and berry necrosis and loss of yield.
The damage was not completely
uniform over the whole area with the Cabernet
Sauvignon vines being not as badly affected as the white varieties, although
individual
Cabernet vines were badly affected. The Rhine Reisling and Semillon
vines were more affected than the Trebiano. By the time of the
inspection, the
plants in Vineyard 2 were dead. Indeed, in 1990, Vineyard 2 was ploughed up and
a rice crop was planted; although
so late in the season that it was
unsuccessful. The damage seen by Mr Hutchins was typical of exposure to a 2,
4-D weedicide, that
weedicide being deadly to grapevines. What grapes were
produced in the season could not be sold.
<P>

22   		The evidence establishes clearly that spray drift from
the spray applied to the Rendell property caused the damage to the
vineyards
and to trees and plants on "Billabong". 
<P>

23   		All the defendants would have been aware that aerial
spraying of the weedicide 2, 4-D was likely to cause harm to any occupier
of a
property in the proximity which had susceptible vines, trees and plants on it,
if adequate care to avoid harm was not taken.
The labels alone made that plain.
It cannot be in doubt that it was known to the four defendants that the
weedicide was a dangerous
chemical and that care in its use must be taken to
avoid harm. 
<P>

24   		In <i>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty
Limited,</i> the majority made the point that, where activities were carried
out which involved the handling or storing of dangerous goods, the
duty to take
care would not necessarily be discharged by the employment of a competent
independent contractor and that each person
had a duty to ensure that
reasonable care was taken. At 550, the majority said:
<P>

"<i>It has long been recognised that there are certain categories of case in
which a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable
risk of injury to
another will not be discharged merely by the employment of a qualified and
ostensibly competent independent contractor.
In those categories of case, the
nature of the relationship of proximity gives rise to a duty of care of a
special and `more stringent'
kind, namely a `duty to ensure that reasonable
care is taken': see </i>Kondis v State Transport Authority<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR
672</a> at 686. Put differently, the requirement of reasonable care in those
categories of case extends to seeing that care is taken.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Viewed from the perspective of the person to whom the duty is owed, the
relationship of proximity giving rise to the non-delegable
duty of care in such
cases is marked by special dependence or vulnerability on the part of that
person: </i>The Commonwealth v Introvigne<i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 258</a> at 271, per
Mason J.</i>"
<P>

25   		In the present case, the nature of the chemicals being
sprayed was such that all persons responsible for the operation, that
is the
four defendants, had a non-delegable duty to ensure that properties in the
vicinity of the Rendell land were not damaged by
the spraying.
<P>

26   		It therefore does not matter whether Mr Herschfelder was
an employee or an independent contractor of the first defendant,
a point which
neither the evidence nor the statement of claim makes clear. The actions of Mr
Rendell were also the actions of his
company and therefore he is personally
responsible and the third defendant, Rendell Nominees Pty Limited is
responsible for his acts
and omissions.
<P>

27   		The 2, 4-D weedicides were deadly to grapevines. The
Rhone Poulenc label stated that spray drift can travel great distances.
Mr
Hutchins gave evidence that he knew of two instances where, in calm conditions,
spray drift had caused harm fifteen and twenty-five
kilometres away from the
sprayed property. The spraying of land only three hundred metres away from the
nearest vines on "Billabong"
was an inherently dangerous activity which was
likely to cause harm unless extreme caution was taken. 
<P>

28   		Amongst his other fields of expertise, Mr Hutchins has
expertise with respect to aerial spraying, for he has had control
of such
spraying and had studied means of minimising spray drift. Mr Hutchins gave
evidence which I accept that aerial spraying is
particularly dangerous when
there is only a very light wind or no wind. Mr Hutchins said that, unless there
is a wind, which should
be blowing away from any vulnerable properties, the
spray tended to remain in the air in the form of droplets or mixed with dust
and that spraying should not be carried out unless there was a wind of five
kilometres per hour or more but less than fifteen to
twenty kilometres per
hour. He said that a wind of ten kilometres per hour was ideal for such a wind
tended to drive the spray down
into the crop which was being sprayed. Mr
Hutchins explained that there was also more risk when the weather was
relatively warm,
as it was on the evening of 12 November 1989 when the
temperature was twenty-five degrees Celsius, for in warm conditions the spray
tended to remain in the air and even to undergo a process of volatisation, to
become a gaseous mixture. Another significant factor
is the size of the drops
which form the spray. When the small Micronair nozzles are used and set so as
to create a fine spray, which
was the position with the setting at 35 degrees,
the spray may hang in the air and even vaporise. In such circumstances, the
spray
is particularly susceptible to drift. Mr Hutchins explained that spraying
is safest when heavier drops are used and when there is
a firm wind blowing
away from any susceptible crops. 
<P>

29   		Mr Hutchins explained that the quantity of spray used is
a relevant factor, for the greater the quantity the greater may
be the spray
drift. Mr Hutchins said that 480 litres sprayed over the Rendell property was a
substantial quantity, for only a small
mount of the 2, 4-D Amine would cause
severe damage to the Bonics' vineyards.
<P>

30   		Mr Hutchins expressed the view which I accept that it was
not safe to aerial spray the Rendell land when the plaintiffs'
vineyard were in
such close proximity. He also expressed the view which I accept that, if such
spraying were to be done, which was
unwise, it should only have been done when
there was a wind of over five kilometres per hour blowing away from
"Billabong", which
would have been the case had the wind been blowing from the
north or north-east rather than from the south-south-east. Mr Hutchins
said
that the use of a fine spray in warmish weather contributed to the spray drift.

<P>

31   		The following two paragraphs appear in the Mr
Herschfelder's statement which was read as part of the plaintiffs' case:
<P>

"<i>10.	From my knowledge and experience as an agricultural pilot I am fully
aware of ideal spraying conditions. It is important for there
to be a slight
breeze which there was while I was applying the spray. In my opinion the
spraying conditions were ideal.</i>
<P>

<i>11.	Further in my opinion from the wind speed and direction during the
spraying operation, the alleged damage to the Plaintiff's crop
did not occur
from the aerial spraying performed by myself.</i>"
<P>

However, the spraying conditions were not ideal. I am satisfied that the
plaintiffs' land "Billabong" and also the Canarney Farms
suffered damage as a
result of the aerial spraying and that this was due to spray drift from the
Rendell land. The spraying conditions
were not ideal because the direction of
the wind, 150 degrees, was from a generally southerly direction and it took
only a minor
wind shift, which occurred after the spraying had concluded, to
carry the residual spray which remained in the air to the north onto
"Billabong" and the Canarney Farms.
<P>

32   		I am satisfied that the spraying carried with it a
recognisable risk that spray would drift onto "Billabong" and would harm
the
vines, trees and susceptible plants thereon, and that the negligent manner in
which the spraying was carried out increased that
risk.
<P>

33   		The steps taken by the defendants to protect the property
"Billabong" from harm fell short of the steps which a person having
a duty of
care to the owners and occupiers of "Billabong" ought to have taken. In the
circumstances, the first, second, third and
fourth defendants are liable in
negligence for the damage which has resulted to the plaintiffs therefrom.
<P>

34   		Although I have dealt with the matter under the
principles of negligence I am also of the view that the defendants are
responsible
under the principles of nuisance, if those principles be applied.
Their action of aerial spraying the weedicides in the close proximity
to the
plaintiffs' vulnerable vines, especially in the circumstance that the general
drift of the wind was to the north rather than
to the south, was not
reasonable. The benefit of destroying the weeds on the Rendell property could
not possibly justify the harm
to the plaintiffs' vineyards. Accordingly,
liability is also established on this ground.
<P>

35   		On the issue of damages, Mr Ireland principally submitted
that they should be assessed in accordance with the principles
of nuisance.
However, I do not consider that there is any relevant distinction as to damages
between the principles of nuisance and
negligence applicable in this case.
<P>

36   		Mr Ireland submitted that damages should be awarded at
least to Jure and Eva Bonic, who are registered as the proprietors
of
"Billabong", and also to John Bonic whom he said had entered into a formal
partnership with his parents during the 1980s. The
partnership accounts and
income tax returns do not include Frank Bonic as a partner. It appears that he
was to have a particular
interest in the winemaking activities which were
contemplated. However, the statement of John Bonic which was tendered said that
he commenced working for his parents at the end of 1976 and that, "<i>After a
few years working for my parents I entered into partnership with them and my
brother</i>". Whatever the accounts said, I am satisfied that the working
relationship between the parties was such that there was from 1988
effectively
a partnership between all members of the family. Indeed Frank Bonic expressly
said in his statement, "<i>The business conducted on `Billabong' has always
been run as a Partnership</i>". The accounts of Capital Wines Pty Ltd show that
all the members of the family participated in the winemaking venture. For the
purposes
of damages, I am of the view that all four plaintiffs should be
regarded as having an interest in the vineyards. I am satisfied that
the
venture was not conducted with any strict regard to legal niceties and that the
business carried on on the property was a family
venture in which, from 1988,
when Frank Bonic returned to live on the property, all members of the family
participated and from which
they all benefited. 
<P>

37   		As an indication of this point, I should mention that, in
the 1989 and 1990 years, funds, which together with interest totalled
$250,000
approximately, were deposited with the Pyramid Building Society in the name of
Frank Bonic. The deposit books are in evidence
showing a number of deposits
into accounts in his name. The evidence as to how this came about is not
entirely clear but it seems
that grapes from "Billabong" were sent to wineries
in the name of Frank Bonic and that the cheques therefor were deposited in his
name. John Bonic gave evidence that this course of action arose from the fact
that Frank Bonic had had a motor cycle accident and
that, after a family
conference, it was decided to put moneys into the Pyramid Building Society for
his welfare. That evidence was
not the whole truth. One result of the step
taken was that the sums paid to the Pyramid Building Society were not disclosed
in the
partnership's accounts and, as a result, the income returned in the
partnership's income tax returns was correspondingly diminished.
No evidence
was given that Frank Bonic returned the sums as income and I infer that he did
not. Lest it be thought that sums deposited
to the Pyramid Building Society
account were to be treated entirely as Frank Bonic's money, I should mention
that Frank Bonic, in
his evidence, stated that as at April/May 1990 "<i>our
family resources</i>" comprised moneys on deposit with the ANZ Bank and the
investment of approximately $250,000 with the Pyramid Building Society. Frank
Bonic also stated that, but for the damage to the vineyards in November 1989,
"<i>our family</i>" had intended to use part of the sum of $250,000 for the
acquisition of a new tractor, the cost of trellising Vineyard 2 and initial
expenditure on the construction of the winery which "<i>we</i>" had planned. I
conclude that the money was not lost to the family by its investment in Frank's
name. In 1989 and 1990 Frank was
very much a part of the business carried on on
"Billabong". Much of the money was lost, however, when, in 1990 the Pyramid
Building
Society failed. A dividend of a proportion of the money was received
only after the Government's intervention. 
<P>

38   		Vineyard 2, which had been planted early in 1989, was
badly affected by the spray and within a few weeks the cuttings were
dead. The
replanting did not occur until 1995. The delay in replanting was due to a
number of factors, one of which was this litigation
which commenced in 1990.
Another cause of delay was that, when the vineyards stopped producing and when
the Pyramid Building Society
failed, the plaintiffs found themselves without
the funds which they needed both for their living expenses and to enable them
to
re-establish Vineyard 2. 
<P>

39   		Vineyard 1 was badly affected by the spray but it may be
debatable whether the vineyard needs replanting. Mr Hutchins gave
evidence
that, while there is no cure for hormone herbicide harm except time, there is a
general view that vineyards affected by
2, 4-D weedicide will recover in about
three years. He said that that was a view which was strongly held by some
persons but that
it was not a view which he himself holds. Mr Hutchins said
that he has heard of properties which have not recovered from such harm.
He
gave evidence that he was not sure that Vineyard 1 would ever fully recover.

<P>

40   		When Mr Hutchins inspected "Billabong" on a second
occasion on 10 December 1998, Vineyard 1 was producing only fifty to sixty
per
cent of its potential production. Mr Hutchins gave evidence that the vineyard
was still showing signs of having been affected
by the spray, that the
formation of the bunches of grapes was not the formation one would expect to
see on healthy vines, but was
deficient or deformed. Mr Hutchins said that he
made relevant enquiries as to the manner in which the plaintiffs maintained the
vineyard
and ultimately satisfied himself that the cause of the problem which
he could see was the effect of the spraying in 1989. He said
that Vineyard 2
which had been replanted in 1995 was developing normally with healthy growth.
He said that he was satisfied that
Vineyard 1 had received proper nourishment
and that its deformities were the result of the spray drift. I accept Mr
Hutchins' evidence
on that point.
<P>

41   		Perhaps one reason why the vines were slow to recover was
that in 1993 they suffered an attack of a fungus which was endemic
in the area.
Ordinarily the fungus is controlled by appropriate sprays. The plaintiffs had
treated the vines in the usual manner
but, because the vines had been weakened
by the spray in 1989, they did not respond and suffered considerable fungus
damage in that
year. Another problem that occurred was that, because the tops
of the vines had been badly affected by the spray, the vines started
to shoot
at the bottom and these shoots had to be removed whenever they appeared.
<P>

42   		Mr Hutchins is of the view that, given careful treatment,
the vines in Vineyard 1 will ultimately recover their normal health.
However,
the plaintiffs have suffered a decade in which Vineyard 1 has failed to perform
up to expectations. The vines are still
showing signs of deformity and their
production is severely limited. The plaintiffs have decided to replant Vineyard
1 and propose
to undertake that operation later this year. That appears to me
to be a sensible, commercial decision and I approach the issue of
damages on
the basis that that is a proper action to take and that the delay which has
occurred in doing so, if it could be called
delay, was due to the necessity of
determining how the vineyard would respond to careful treatment.
<P>

43   		A claim is also made for the delay in developing the
remaining paddock into a vineyard. The land was levelled in about 1987
years to
enable it to be used as a vineyard. The plaintiffs have only just commenced
establishing a nursery of cuttings to enable
them to plant up the new area.
They claim loss for the delay and the establishment of this new vineyard, which
they allege was due
to the lack of funds brought about by the damage to
Vineyards 1 and 2.

Mr Shields has provided detailed schedules which set out the items he has taken
into account in respect of each vineyard. It is
unnecessary to set them out. Mr
Shields has assumed that Vineyard 1 will be replanted in 1999 and will come
into full production
in the year 2004.  He has calculated the loss on Vineyard
2 on the footing that it was replanted in 1996 and will come into full
production in the year 2001. Mr Shields has assessed Vineyard 3 on the basis
that it will be planted in 2001 and will be in full
production in the year
2004. The years adopted are the financial years ending on 30th June of the
specified years. 
<P>

45   		In making these calculations, Mr Shields has assumed that
the damages award will be a capital sum for the purposes of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936</a> (Cth) and therefore that he should deduct tax from his
estimates of profits in order to give a true reflection of the actual loss
which the plaintiffs would have suffered. This approach is in my opinion
correct. No submissions have been made with respect to the
application of the
capital gains tax provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> and I have given
them no consideration.
<P>

46   		Looking at Vineyards 1 and 2 for the moment, the damages
awarded in respect of them will be damages for the harm done to
the vineyards
and the resultant diminution in the plaintiffs' earning capacity and not for
loss of income as such. In <i>Whitaker v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/262.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 262</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2082%20FCR%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 82 FCR 261</a>, when speaking of personal injury cases, Burchett J said at
283:
<P>

"<i>[In] principle the award is for the loss of earning capacity, not for
particular wages.</i>"
<P>

His Honour referred inter alia to remarks of Mason and Dawson JJ in <i>Redding
v Lee</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 117</a> at 133-4, of Barwick CJ in <i>O'Brien v McKean</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1968/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20118%20CLR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 118 CLR 540</a> at 546, of Windeyer J in the same case at 557 and of Brennan
J in <i>Tinkler v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1979/88.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] FCA 88</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2029%20ALR%20663" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 29 ALR 663</a> at
667. The substance of those comments is that the ground of damages for economic
loss may be the destruction or impairment of earning
capacity. And so it is in
the present case, where the assessment of what the earnings of the plaintiffs
would have been but for the
harm resulting to the plaintiffs' property from the
defendants' negligence is simply the means of calculating what is fair
compensation
for that harm and not itself the object of the award.
<P>

47   		Thus in <i>Glenboig Union Fireclay Company Ltd v
Commissioners of Inland Revenue</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281922%29%2012%20Tax%20Cas%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1922) 12 TC 427</a> compensation awarded for
the sterilisation of a load of fireclay was held not to be taxable profits
although it was calculated on
the basis of two-and-one half year's working.
Similarly, in <i>Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Ballantine</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281924%29%208%20Tax%20Cas%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1924) 8 TC
595</a>, where a sum of interest was included in the total award, it was treated
not as interest but as part of the capital sum awarded.
In this country,
<i>Whitaker v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i> and <i>Commissioner of
Taxation v Northumberland Development Co Pty Ltd</i> are to the same effect.

<P>

48   		Mr Shields has incorporated a 3% discount in his
calculations of profits in accordance with the figure adopted in <i>Todorovic v
Waller</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20150%20CLR%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 150 CLR 402.</a>
<P>

49   		In assessing "<i>probable</i>" production, had the
vineyards not suffered damage from the spray, Mr Shields has relied upon
average figures for vineyards in the
Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, it being
conceded that the plaintiffs' figures for actual production in 1989 and earlier
are not reliable.
Figures for the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area are available
and properties therein are analogous to "Billabong". Figures for the precise
district in which "Billabong" is situated are not available. 
<P>

50   		I am prepared to accept Mr Shields' figures and the basis
upon which he prepared them. Indeed, the fact that during some
periods the
plaintiffs achieved actual returns for their grapes and bulk wine production
greater than the figures which Mr Shields
has taken into account for probable
production shows that Mr Shields' figures are conservative. Mr Shields has
explained that the
actual prices which the plaintiffs achieved for their bulk
wine and their transfer prices to Capital Wines Pty Ltd were in some years
greater than the prices which he has taken into account in calculating the
plaintiffs' "<i>probable</i>" returns.
<P>

51   		Mr Shields was correct, in my opinion, in ignoring the
fact that the company Capital Wines Pty Ltd, was incorporated in 1991,
and
thereafter formed part of the income earning structure. As I have already
mentioned, the task is not to determine the actual
profits which the plaintiffs
would have made but for the harm caused by the spray drift but rather to
determine what is fair compensation
for the harm done to the vineyards and to
their income earning capacity. In this regard the precise structures that were
subsequently
adopted can be disregarded. See <i>Hungerfords v Walker</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20171%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989)
171 CLR 125</a> at 150.
<P>

52   		I accept the manner in which Mr Shields has calculated
the damages in relation to Vineyards 1 and 2. Although another producer
with
greater assets may have undertaken the replantings at an earlier stage, I do
not consider that any delay should be taken into
account to the plaintiffs'
detriment. "Billabong" was a small property and the plaintiffs did not have
extensive resources or ready
access to additional capital. It is understandable
that their plans were thrown into confusion for quite a substantial time. And
it has, indeed, been necessary to wait to see whether Vineyard 1 would recover
before undertaking the substantial expense of replanting
it.
<P>

53   		I have given such consideration to Mr Shields' figures as
I am able to. I have not identified any additional matter that
Mr Shields
should have taken into account or any matter that he has failed to take into
account. I accept his calculation of the
damages with respect to the harm done
to Vineyards 1 and 2 as being a reasonable assessment of the loss flowing from
the damage caused
to those vineyards and their production by the spray drift.

<P>

54   		Vineyard 3 falls into a different category. Although the
planting of Vineyard 3 was one of the projects which the plaintiffs
had in mind
for some time in the future, the time of the planting does not appear to have
been actually determined when the aerial
spraying occurred in November 1989.
Thus, Frank Bonic did not mention it as one of the items on which the $250,000
in the Pyramid
Building Society accounts was to be spent. An earlier project to
which attention was being given was the construction of a winery
for the
production of bulk wines. That project in fact went ahead. A winemaker was
engaged in the early years but Frank Bonic has
since studied for and passed the
degree of Bachelor of Applied Science (Wine Science) at Charles Sturt
University. In his oral evidence,
John Bonic gave evidence that, "<i>Back then
</i>(November 1989)<i>, I think we were concentrating on mainly the winery side
...</i>".
<P>

55   		It would be speculative to calculate damages on the
footing that the plaintiffs were delayed in planting out Vineyard 3.
To take an
example, Frank Bonic gave evidence that, in 1990, the plaintiffs had the
opportunity to purchase a further 2,000 acres
of land for $220,000. The land
was situated some four kilometres from "Billabong". The plaintiffs wished to
purchase this land so
they could commence planting red wine varieties and
proposed initially to plant approximately 100 acres to a mix of Cabernet,
Merlot,
Shiraz and Malbec. Frank Bonic said that, as a result of the loss of
income from the Vineyards 1 and 2, the plaintiffs were unable
to purchase this
land. This item of evidence, which is not relied upon as a head of damage,
shows how wrong it would be to assume,
as Mr Shields has assumed for the
purposes of his figures, that Vineyard 3 would have been planted out in 1994.
That may have happened
or something different may have happened.
<P>

56   		In <i>Hungerfords v Walker</i> the Court, Mason CJ,
Wilson, Brennan and Deane JJ, Dawson J dissenting, held that expenses incurred
and opportunity costs arising
from moneys being paid away or withheld as a
result of a breach of contract or negligence are pecuniary losses suffered by a
plaintiff
as a result of the defendant's conduct and therefore are an element
of the loss for which the plaintiff is entitled to be compensated
by an award
of damages. Their Honours held that damage resulting from loss of the use of
money was a foreseeable loss, within the
contemplation of the parties, which
could be directly related to the defendant's breach of contract or negligence.
The general principle
was stated by Mason CJ and Wilson J at 142 as follows:
<P>

"<i>If a plaintiff sustains loss or damage in relation to money which he has
paid out or forgone, why is he not entitled to recover damages
for loss of the
use of money when the loss or damage sustained was reasonably foreseeable as
liable to result from the relevant breach
of contract or tort? After all, that
is the fundamental rule governing the recovery of damages, according to the
first limb in </i>Hadley v Baxendale (<i>see</i> Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
v Newman Industries Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20KB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 KB 528</a> at 539) <i>and, subject to proximity,
in negligence. The object of the second limb in </i>Hadley v Baxendale<i> was
to include loss arising from special circumstances of which the defendant had
actual knowledge when that loss does not fall within
the first limb because it
does not arise from `the ordinary course of things' of which the defendant has
imputed knowledge: see </i>Victoria Laundry<i>. To allow a plaintiff to recover
special, but not general, damages, is illogical, subverts the second limb in
</i>Hadley v Baxendale<i> from its intended purpose and introduces a new
element into the general measure of damages for negligence.</i>
<P>

57   		At 143, Mason CJ and Wilson J explained that such
damages, calculated with reference to appropriate interest rates, may be
reasonably foreseeable. Their Honours said:
<P>

"<i>The requirement of foreseeability is no obstacle to the award of damages,
calculated by reference to the appropriate interest rates,
for loss of the use
of money. Opportunity cost, more so than incurred expense, is a plainly
foreseeable loss because, according to
common understanding, it represents the
market price of obtaining money.</i>"
<P>

At 154, their Honours rejected other contentions as to how the moneys may have
been used. Their Honours expressed the view that
it might be more appropriate
to measure a loss on the basis of opportunity costs by reference to current
market rates of interest.

<P>

58   		A point being made by their Honours was that, if there is
harm to a business which will result in a loss of income, it can
be readily
foreseen that such a loss will involve a loss in the use of money which can be
measured by reference to appropriate interest
rates. However, their Honours
rejected the view that, absent special knowledge so as to bring the matter
within the second rule in
<i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>, the Court should engage
any speculation as to how moneys lost may have been expended if received. 
<P>

59   		In <i>Malec v J.C. Hutton Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a>
the High Court explained that, in the assessment of  the future earning
capacity of a plaintiff who had been injured as a consequence
of the
defendant's negligence, it was necessary to engage in a degree of speculation.
Brennan and Dawson JJ said at 640:
<P>

"<i>To make a finding on the balance of probabilities as though the prospect
were something that had occurred in the past was to misconceive
the process of
evaluation.</i>"
<P>

At 643 Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said:
<P>

"<i>Where proof is necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as
certain a prediction which has a 51 per cent probability of
occurring, but to
ignore altogether a prediction which has a 49 per cent probability of
occurring. Thus, the court assesses the degree
of probability that an event
would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to
reflect the degree of probability.</i>"
<P>

In <i>Norris v Blake (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%2041%20NSWLR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 41 NSWLR 49</a>, Clarke JA with whom Handley
and Sheller JJA agreed, examined the point in even more detail and at 75
said:
<P>

"<i>It follows from what I have said that the Court is concerned to determine
what, on the evidence, was the most probable course that
the respondent's
career would have taken, what amount should be awarded to compensate him for
the losses flowing from his inability
to follow that course, and finally to
make adjustments to the sum resulting from that determination to take account
of the contingencies
which in this case include the loss of the chance to do
even better, to become, as it were, a successful star in the United States,
even a superstar.</i>"
<P>

One can see therefore that, at least where future employment is concerned, the
fact that possibilities may be speculative does not
mean that they should not
be taken into account.
<P>

60   		However, the issue with respect to Vineyard 3 is
different from that where the hypothetical future of a person who was injured
has to be taken into account. The issue that we are speaking about now is not
what the future would have been of  Vineyards 1 and
2 had they not been harmed.
The issue is the damages flowing from the non receipt of income from Vineyards
1 and 2. It is said by
the plaintiffs that the non receipt of those moneys
necessitated their delaying the planting of Vineyard 3, but it must be kept in
mind that the spray drift on the property did not adversely affect the paddock
on which Vineyard 3 was to be planted and there is
no evidence that the
defendants were aware of the plaintiffs' plans to plant Vineyard 3. From the
defendants' viewpoint, the spray
drift onto Vineyards 1 and 2 could just as
readily have encouraged the plaintiffs to progress the planting of another
vineyard as
otherwise. The defendants would have been able to foresee that
money might have had to be borrowed and they could foresee interest
charges
thereon. However it does not seem to me that it was reasonably foreseeable that
the spray drift onto Vineyards 1 and 2 would
cause large losses in respect of a
vineyard yet to be planted on land which was not affected.
<P>

61   		For these reasons I am of the view that the appropriate
method of awarding damages in respect of the element of loss of the
use of
money is to award interest at appropriate rates. As no other rates have been
put forward, I shall adopt the rates set out
in Schedule J to the Rules of the
Court.
<P>

62   		Accordingly the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for
the sums calculated by Mr Shields in respect of Vineyards 1 and 2.
Interest
should be added by relating the interest rates set out in Schedule J to the
details of Mr Shields' calculations in respect
of Vineyards 1 and 2. The total
should be reduced by the compensation which has been received from other
parties, the amount of which
was stated by counsel. The first four named
defendants should pay the costs of the plaintiffs. Counsel should bring in
short minutes
within seven days giving effect to these findings.
<P>
