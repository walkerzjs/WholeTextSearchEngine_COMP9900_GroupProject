<b>2309/98	OCEANIC LIFE LTD v HIH CASUALTY &amp; GENERAL INSURANCE LTD &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>	Introduction</b>
<P>

1	This case raises some important questions about solicitors' conflicts of
interest.  The Plaintiff (`Oceanic') seeks relief of
various kinds in order to
prevent the First Defendant (`HIH') from continuing to retain the Second
Defendants (`McCabes' - a Sydney
firm of solicitors) and the Third Defendants
(Gunson Pickard &amp; Hann - `Gunson' - a Hobart firm of solicitors) in certain
proceedings
in the Supreme Court of Tasmania.  The Plaintiff also seeks to
prevent the Defendants from using documents allegedly obtained in
breach of
duty.  
<P>

	<b>The IRPS and HIH proceedings</b>
<P>

2	HIH was the professional indemnity insurer of a company called Investment
&amp; Retirement Planning Services Pty Ltd (`IRPS').
 IRPS was an insurance
agent of Oceanic.  In about 1991 a dispute arose between Oceanic and IRPS
concerning the payment of commission.
 Oceanic claims that IRPS misrepresented
the character of insurance premiums which it procured, falsely claiming that
they were referable
to new business rather than renewals in order to obtain
commission for itself.  Oceanic commenced proceedings against IRPS in the
Supreme Court of Tasmania in May 1993 (`IRPS proceedings').  Since by that time
IRPS was in liquidation, it was necessary for Oceanic
to seek leave to
institute the proceedings under s 500(2) of the Corporations Law.  Zeeman J
delivered a judgment on that application
on 27 August 1993.  His Honour granted
leave to Oceanic to commence proceedings, upon its undertaking not to enforce
any judgment
it may obtain without the leave of the Court.  
<P>

3	Initially Griffits and Jackson, Hobart solicitors, appeared for IRPS in the
IRPS proceedings, as agent for Phillips Fox in Sydney,
filing a defence on 3
May 1994.  The evidence indicates that although nominally the defendant was
IRPS, the defence was funded by
HIH.  
<P>

4	On 28 February 1992 IRPS (in liquidation) gave notice to HIH under the
professional indemnity policy regarding Oceanic's claim
for overpaid
commission.  HIH's solicitor, Phillips Fox, advised that HIH was not obliged to
meet the claim under the policy.  And
so a second dispute arose, this time
between the insurer and the insured as to whether the professional indemnity
policy responded
to the insured's claim.  However, events took an unusual turn
on 30 April 1993, when a deed was entered into between the liquidator,
on
behalf of IRPS, and Oceanic.  By the deed, supplemented by a further deed dated
27 July 1993, IRPS assigned to Oceanic its interest
in the chose in action
comprising its right of recovery against HIH under the policy with respect to
Oceanic's claim against IRPS.
 Notice of the assignment was duly given to HIH.

<P>

5	Although there is a dispute between Oceanic and HIH as to the validity of the
assignment, that question was not contested before
me.  On their face the two
deeds appear to constitute a valid written assignment of the chose in action
comprising the policy claim,
perfected by notice under the statutory provisions
for such an assignment (Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW), S 12;  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/calopa1884334/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and
Law of Property Act 1884</a> (Tas), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/calopa1884334/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 86).</a>  I propose to assume that the assignment
is valid for the purposes of the present proceedings, without deciding the
point.
<P>

6	On 10 June 1993 Phillips Fox wrote to the liquidator of IRPS indicating their
view that the claim was not covered by the policy
and that the assignment was
invalid.  They also sought his consent to take over the conduct of the defence
in the IRPS proceedings,
without admissions, and sought copies of all relevant
documents.  They asked him to acknowledge that they were at liberty to inform
HIH of all matters of which they may become aware, recognising that these
matters would be available to be used by HIH in assessing
the policy claim.
Phillips Fox wrote a follow-up letter in similar terms on 22 June 1993.
<P>

7	By letter of the same day Butler McIntyre and Butler, a Hobart law firm,
wrote to Phillips Fox on behalf of IRPS (in liquidation)
confirming consent to
HIH taking over and conducting the defence in the IRPS proceedings `on the
conditions set out in your letter
dated 10th June'.  I find that Butler
McIntyre's letter constitutes or implies the acknowledgment sought by Phillips
Fox, that they
were at liberty to pass on information to HIH.
<P>

8	On 24 May 1994 Oceanic instituted proceedings against HIH in the Supreme
Court of Tasmania for recovery under the policy (`HIH
proceedings'), suing as
assignee of the insured, IRPS.  Griffits and Jackson appeared for HIH in those
proceedings, acting as agents
for Phillips Fox in Sydney.  They filed a defence
on 22 June 1994.  
<P>

9	By mid 1994, therefore, there were two sets of proceedings in train in the
Supreme Court of Tasmania - the IRPS proceedings, in
which an external party
(Oceanic) sought recovery from the insured (IRPS), and the HIH proceedings
which asserted the insured's claim
against the insurer under a policy which was
alleged to cover the external party's claim.  As the external party had
acquired the
insured's claim under the policy, the external party (Oceanic) was
the plaintiff in both suits.  Griffits and Jackson were the Tasmanian
solicitors for the defendant in each case (that is, IRPS and HIH respectively),
acting as Tasmanian agent for Phillips Fox in Sydney.
<P>

	<b>Applications for the proceedings to be heard together, and
consolidated</b>
<P>

10	Not surprisingly, Oceanic applied to the Supreme Court of Tasmania seeking
orders that the two proceedings be heard at the same
time.  On 13 June 1995
Zeeman J ordered that the two proceedings be heard together.
<P>

11	The move to hear the proceedings together seems to have been the catalyst
for the events which have led to the present application.
 On 12 May 1995,
shortly before the hearing date for the application to hear the two proceedings
together, Oceanic's Sydney solicitors,
Clayton Utz, were contacted by a partner
of McCabes, who said that he had just received instructions for his firm to act
for IRPS
`because of a conflict'.  He said that Gunson would be acting for IRPS
in Tasmania.  A Notice of Change of Solicitor from Griffits
and Jackson to
Gunson was subsequently filed in the IRPS proceedings.  At that stage HIH
continued to be represented by Phillips
Fox in Sydney and Griffits and Jackson
in Hobart.  
<P>

12	Although Zeeman J had ordered that the two proceedings be heard together,
the cases remained separately constituted, each with
a different defendant.
However, it was obvious that the substantial contest was between Oceanic and
HIH.  It would have been natural
for HIH to explore whether, in those
circumstances, it was necessary to continue separate legal representation for
each defendant,
given that all of the defence costs were to be funded by HIH.
It appears that HIH did so.  On about 25 November 1996 McCabes contacted
Clayton Utz to ask whether the plaintiff would consent to the proceedings being
consolidated, IRPS thereafter being unrepresented.
 By letter of 25 November
1996 Clayton Utz responded, indicating that if the proceedings were
consolidated, their client would not
object to IRPS no longer being
represented, but would object to HIH taking over the conduct of the proceedings
on behalf of IRPS.
 The reason given was that there would be a conflict of
interest if the same solicitors acted for both HIH and IRPS, since they would
be arguing on behalf of IRPS that it was not guilty of misleading and deceptive
conduct, while defending the claim against HIH on
the ground that the claim was
not covered by the policy because (inter alia) IRPS was guilty of fraudulent
non-disclosure.  
<P>

13	On 28 November 1996 McCabes informed Clayton Utz that they had taken over
the conduct of the HIH proceedings on behalf of HIH
and that they would cease
acting for IRPS.  A Notice of Change of Solicitor from Griffits and Jackson to
Gunson was filed in the
HIH proceedings on 9 December 1996.  An application for
consolidation of the two proceedings was filed on 11 December 1996 and on
10
December 1996 Zeeman J ordered that the two proceedings be consolidated.
Subsequently a consolidated statement of claim was filed
and a defence was
filed on behalf of HIH.  Default judgment was entered against IRPS on 29
October 1997.  Damages against IRPS have
not yet been assessed.
<P>

14	The liquidator of IRPS wrote to McCabes on 13 July 1998 stating that he had
no objection to McCabes acting for HIH in the consolidated
proceedings and that
he did not oppose McCabes seeking access to any documents of IRPS which they
may find of assistance.
<P>

	<b>The issues in the consolidated proceedings</b>
<P>

15	Oceanic's further amended statement of claim in the consolidated
proceedings<b> </b>alleges that the IRPS engaged in misleading and deceptive
conduct by misrepresenting the nature of payments made by two superannuation
funds, in order to secure a higher rate of commission.  Oceanic also alleges
that IRPS owed Oceanic a duty of care which it failed
to discharge during the
preparation of proposal forms and its analysis of payments by the
superannuation funds in order to identify
commissionable new money.  The
statement of claim alleges that HIH has wrongfully refused to indemnify IRPS
under the policy, and
that the right of recovery against HIH under the policy
has been validly assigned by IRPS (in liquidation) to Oceanic.  Oceanic claims
damages and interest against IRPS and orders that HIH is liable to indemnify
IRPS under the policy or is liable to pay damages to
IRPS for breach of the
policy.  
<P>

16	In its defence HIH does not admit the allegations of misleading conduct and
negligence against IRPS.  It denies that it was liable
to indemnify IRPS in
respect of Oceanic's claim.  It says that the assignment of the right of
recovery contravened IRPS's duty of
good faith under the policy.  It alleges
contributory negligence by Oceanic on a number of grounds, including alleged
failure by
Oceanic to establish a proper system to identify the nature of the
payments made by the superannuation fund.  Further, HIH's defence
asserts that
for various reasons the policy does not cover the claim.  It says that to the
extent that the claim is based on misleading
conduct which is deliberate and
fraudulent, some specific policy exclusions apply.  Additionally, it alleges
that IRPS breached its
duty of disclosure by failing to inform HIH that it was
insolvent, and by failing to disclose that it was engaging in deliberately
fraudulent and misleading conduct.  It is alleged that IRPS's conduct, if
proved, would not constitute a breach of professional duty
within the terms of
the policy.  Finally, the defence alleges that IRPS has breached the policy by
admitting liability for the claim.
 
<P>

	<b>The plaintiff's claims to privilege and as to conflicts of interest</b>
<P>

17	The defendant provided particulars of its defence on 11 February 1998.  The
particulars specified that IRPS's admissions in breach
of the policy were made
in four letters written in October 1991.  It appears that copies of those
letters had come into the possession
of HIH, though the evidence does not
indicate whether they were supplied by IRPS, McCabes or Gunson, or someone
else.  The letters
were also listed in the plaintiff's consolidated list of
discovered documents, where three of them were designated as privileged
documents.  Paragraph 2 of the verified consolidated list states:
<P>

	`The Plaintiff objects to producing the documents enumerated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/calopa1884334/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the
First Schedule hereto [which refers to the original of one of the three
documents and copies of the other two] on the ground
that they are privileged
documents or communications in that they consist of:
<P>

(a) 	correspondence between solicitor and client or of documents that were
brought into existence for the sole purpose of submission
to legal advisers for
advice or use in legal proceedings either contemplated or already commenced.
<P>

(b) 	records of `without prejudice' discussions between the solicitors for the
parties.'
<P>

18	By a letter of 30 March 1998 Gunson indicated that HIH had instructed them
to make an application for production of the three
documents for which
privilege was claimed.  Subsequently the solicitors for Oceanic and HIH
corresponded on the question of privilege
and on the question whether the
Sydney and Hobart solicitors for HIH were excluded from acting because of a
conflict of interest.
 It emerged from the letter of Clayton Utz to McCabes
dated 10 June 1998 that the claim to privilege was confined to three of the
four documents, namely IRPS's letters to Oceanic of 21 and 28 October 1991 and
a letter by Andrew Cox to John Fitzgerald of 28 October
1991, and that the
basis of the claim is that those letters are `without prejudice' documents
passing between Oceanic and IRPS in
the course of genuine negotiations to
settle the dispute between them.
<P>

19	The solicitors' correspondence shows that there are disputes as to whether

<P>

	*	the three specified documents are privileged under the `without prejudice'
rule; 
<P>

	*	other documents in the hands of HIH or its solicitors are protected by the
common law of legal professional privilege or the
`without prejudice' rule or
the law relating to wrongful disclosure of confidential information, and 
<P>

	*	McCabes and Gunson should be restrained from continuing to act for HIH in
view of their past association with IRPS.  
<P>

	<b>The present proceedings</b>
<P>

20	These disputes between the parties are reflected in Oceanic's summons in the
present proceedings, filed on 7 May 1998 and subsequently
amended.  Oceanic
seeks, first, orders (paragraphs 1, 2 &amp; 3 of the summons) against HIH,
McCabes and Gunson respectively which
are designed to prevent McCabes and
Gunson from continuing to act for HIH.  Second, orders are sought that HIH
`shall not be entitled'
to rely on any documents protected by the common law of
legal professional privilege and the `without prejudice' rule of privilege
(paragraphs 4 and 6), and that any documents in the possession of HIH, McCabes
or Gunson falling within these descriptions be delivered
up (paragraph 7).
Third, Oceanic seeks an injunction to restrain McCabes and Gunson from
disclosing to HIH information which they
obtained while they were retained by
IRPS (paragraph 5), and an order that any documents obtained in this way be
delivered up (paragraph
7).  Finally, Oceanic seeks an injunction to restrain
HIH from disclosing the contents of the three without prejudice letters
referred
to above (paragraph 5A).
<P>

21	In addition to these matters, at the hearing HIH contended the Supreme Court
of New South Wales is the wrong forum for determining
Oceanic's entitlement to
relief, and that Oceanic ought to have proceeded by notice of motion in the
Tasmanian proceedings.  Since
I have concluded that this is partly correct, I
propose to deal with the question of the appropriate forum first, and then turn
to
the issues which, in my opinion, should be dealt with by this Court.
<P>

	<b>The appropriate forum</b>
<P>

22	HIH's principal submission is that the present proceedings are an abuse of
the process of the Court to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/calopa1884334/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules
applies.  HIH relies upon <i>McHenry v Lewis </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2022%20ChD%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 22 ChD 397</a>, at 399.
This case is cited in <i>Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure NSW</i> (Looseleaf)
paragraph 13.5.4 as authority for the proposition that `where proceedings have
been started in one court, it may constitute
an abuse of process of the court
to engage in multiple proceedings where there is a complete remedy available in
the court in which
the proceedings were first started'.  However, multiple
proceedings are not necessarily an abuse of process.  In <i>McHenry v Lewis
</i>there were two sets of English proceedings and proceedings in the United
States of America concerning the same subject matter.  There
had been no
application to consolidate the two English proceedings.  There were different
parties to the English and American proceedings,
some amenable to the
jurisdiction of the English court and others amenable to the jurisdiction of
the American court.  In the exercise
of its discretion,  the English court
declined to order a stay of the English proceedings, and the Court of Appeal
agreed.
<P>

23	The central claim in the present proceedings is that McCabes should no
longer represent HIH because of their conflict of interest.
 The claim against
Gunson is, in a sense, derivative.  This is because Gunson, while the
solicitors on the record in the Tasmanian
proceedings, are acting as agents for
McCabes.  The claims with respect to privilege and confidentiality of documents
arise, according
to Oceanic's contention, because McCabes and Gunson have made
available to HIH some privileged and confidential documents which they
acquired
while acting for IRPS, and may make further such documents available in future.
Therefore the proceedings have a practical
and logical connection with the
State where McCabes carries on business, namely New South Wales.  While,
therefore, the relief sought
in the proceedings in this Court might have been
sought by application in the consolidated Tasmanian proceedings, there is no
basis
for characterising the New South Wales proceedings as an abuse of
process.
<P>

24	There being, in my opinion, no abuse of process involved in the present
circumstances, the question is whether I ought to decline
to exercise
jurisdiction on discretionary grounds. To adapt the language of Gummow J in
<i>National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corporation </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2087%20ALR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 87 ALR 539</a>,
561, the present case is one where the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the
proceedings but may choose to decline to do so because
the suit is one which in
justice should be tried elsewhere.
<P>

25	HIH referred to the following passage in the judgment of Gummow J in the<i>
National Mutual </i>case (at 563-4):
<P>

	`In my view, prima facie there is an interference with the conduct of
litigation in this court where, as in the present case, one
party seeks in the
courts of another country to enjoin its former solicitors from acting as
solicitors for an opposing party in the
litigation in this court.  It is a
procedure apt to bring about a situation whereby that other party changes his
solicitor, a step
of primary and paramount concern to this court.  And it has a
tendency to interfere with the procedures of this court, of a character
and
degree quite above that of the United States pretrial discovery procedures with
which the House of Lords was concerned in the
<i>South Carolina</i> case
[<i>South Carolina Insurance Co v Assurantie Maatschappij `De Zeven
Provincien'</i> <i>NV </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20AC%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] AC 24]'.</a>
<P>

26	In the <i>National Mutual</i> case the collateral proceedings had been
brought in another country, the United States of America, rather than merely in
another
State, but his Honour's observations are nevertheless highly relevant.
If it were not for the fact that HIH's solicitors in the Tasmanian
proceedings
are the agents for New South Wales solicitors, I would think it inappropriate
for this Court to interfere with the conduct
of litigation in Tasmania by
making orders which would cause a party to the Tasmanian proceedings to change
its solicitor, were I
otherwise disposed to do so.  However, in the present
case the plaintiff's primary complaint is about the conduct of the New South
Wales solicitors for HIH, which is said to be in breach of fiduciary duties,
and that is a matter with which it is appropriate for
this Court to deal.
<P>

27	I have therefore formed the view that it is appropriate to entertain and
dispose of the proceedings before this Court so far
as they relate to whether
McCabes are in breach of any fiduciary duty by accepting a retainer from HIH in
the Tasmanian proceedings
and continuing to act in relation to those
proceedings.  That being so, I believe it is also appropriate for me to deal
with the
application for an order against Gunson, as far as it relates to an
allegation of breach of fiduciary duty by them, even though Gunson
is the
solicitor on the record for a party in proceedings in the court of another
State.  If I were to conclude that an order should
be made against McCabes for
breach of their fiduciary duty as the solicitors for HIH, it would be illogical
not to make a similar
order against their agent Gunson, since the order against
Gunson would be consequential upon my decision with respect to McCabes.
 
<P>

28	If I were to conclude that there has been no breach of any fiduciary duty by
McCabes or Gunson, an important question would remain
for decision.  This is
the question whether Gunson or McCabes have breached a duty which they or
either of them may owe to the Supreme
Court of Tasmania by virtue of their
responsibilities for the conduct of the Tasmanian proceedings.  As I shall
explain, in addition
to the fiduciary duty which the solicitor owes to the
client, a solicitor who acts in litigation owes to the court of which he or
she
is an officer a duty to provide independent assistance to the court by (inter
alia) avoiding conflicts of interest and conflicts
of duty.  Gunson thus owes a
duty to the Supreme Court of Tasmania arising out of acting in the Tasmanian
proceedings.  In my opinion
this Court should not presume to deal with the duty
owed by interstate solicitors to the Supreme Court of their State.  Since
McCabes
are the principals of Gunson, it is probable that they owe a similar
duty to the Supreme Court of Tasmania, upon which, again, this
Court should not
adjudicate.
<P>

29	It appears to me that there is no justification for my making orders which
go to the admissibility of evidence in the Tasmanian
proceedings.  To the
extent, therefore, that Oceanic seeks orders that specific documents, or
documents in a general class of documents,
be excluded from evidence because of
the principles dealing with legal professional privilege or the privilege
attached to `without
prejudice' communications, I do not believe that it would
be appropriate for me to deal with those matters in the present proceedings.
<P>

30	As far as legal professional privilege is concerned, the claim to privilege
arises out of the plaintiff's list of discovered
documents in the Tasmanian
proceedings.  Many documents are listed as subject to a claim to privilege.
The court in the Tasmanian
proceedings will be able to assess the claims to
legal professional privilege in the context of the whole of the facts of the
case,
which will assist the court to determine whether the documents in
question are confidential communications created for the sole purpose
of
providing legal advice or in relation to legal proceedings.  The artificiality
of my purporting to resolve such issues in collateral
proceedings divorced from
the substantive trial is underlined by the fact that I would have to apply the
common law of legal professional
privilege rather than the statutory law which
applies, under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW), where proceedings are commenced in
New South Wales.
<P>

31	To the extent that the claim to privilege is based on the fact that the
three specific letters in question were written without
prejudice, again it
appears to be inappropriate to deal with that question separately from the
trial of the Tasmanian proceedings.
 The correspondence before me indicates
that there are significant factual disputes about the status of the three
documents.  The
parties disagree as to whether there was a dispute between
Oceanic and IRPS at the time when the three letters were written, and
if there
was, whether the letters were written in the course of genuine negotiations for
settlement of such a dispute.  There are
also questions as to whether IRPS
waived privilege, in a manner binding on Oceanic, by disclosing the documents
to HIH in connection
with its policy claim, and whether Oceanic's solicitors
waived privilege in a letter which they wrote to McCabes on 6 August 1996.

<P>

32	While some of the evidence concerning these matters is before me, I am not
in a position to make findings on all of the facts
which are disputed, although
the judge hearing the Tasmanian proceedings will be in a position to do so.
For example, the facts before
me do not enable me to determine whether the
letters written in October 1991 were written after a dispute had arisen between
Oceanic
and IRPS and whether they were in the course of genuine negotiations
for settlement of the dispute.  Again, the inappropriateness
of my making a
determination as to `without prejudice' privilege is underlined by the fact
that in the Tasmanian proceedings, the
issue arises under the common law of
evidence whereas if the Tasmanian proceedings had been proceedings in this
State to which the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> applies, the question would be governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s131.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
131.</a>
<P>

33	To the extent that Oceanic seeks in the present proceedings to protect
documents, either specifically or by class, by reference
to the law of wrongful
disclosure of confidential information, it appears to me that the claim is
fairly closely related to the respective
positions of McCabes and Phillips Fox.
It therefore appears to me appropriate that this aspect of the claim be dealt
with in the
present proceedings.
<P>

34	In the result, therefore, Oceanic fails to the extent that the summons
seeks
<P>

	* relief against Gunson or McCabes for breach of their duty to the Supreme
Court of Tasmania, as opposed to their fiduciary duties
to their client;
and
<P>

	* relief with respect to documents on the basis of legal professional
privilege or `without prejudice' privilege.  
<P>

	I turn to consider Oceanic's claims with respect to solicitors' conflict of
interest, the duty of loyalty and wrongful disclosure
of confidential
information.
<P>

	<b>The law</b>
<P>

35	Where it is alleged that a solicitor has acted improperly in representing
more than one client in litigation, a surprisingly
large number of principles
may be brought into play.  The relevant principles may include the law of
contract, the law of fiduciary
duty, the law which protects confidential
information, the law with respect to legal professional privilege, the law with
respect
to the solicitor's duty to the court and the Court's discretion to
supervise the conduct of its officers, and ethical principles
developed and
applied by a professional disciplinary body.  If the solicitor benefits from a
gift by the client or through some improvident
transaction entered into by the
client, principles with respect to undue influence and unconscionable bargains
will be relevant,
but that is not the case here.
<P>

36	Cases which deal with the solicitor's duty seem to me at times to combine
the various elements of principle into an amalgam which
is a little difficult
to understand.  Following the lead given by Ipp J in <i>Mallesons Stephen
Jaques v KPMG Peat Marwick </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%204%20WAR%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 4 WAR 357</a> and Hayne J in <i>Farrow
Mortgage Services Pty Ltd (In liq) v Mendall Properties Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1995/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] VicRp 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20VR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 VR
1</a>, I believe it is helpful to identify separately the elements of principle
which are the ingredients of the amalgamated statements
in the leading
solicitor-client cases.  Doing so should assist the Court to decide, in an
uncertain case such as the present one,
the scope and content of the
solicitor's duty.  I therefore propose briefly to identify the ingredients of
principle which make up
the present law, and then to consider the cases which
deal specifically with the solicitor's duty.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Contract</b>
<P>

37	Usually, though not necessarily, the solicitor and client are parties to a
contract for the provision of legal professional services
for a fee.  It is
rare for the contract to articulate the solicitor's basic duty of loyalty and
the duty to avoid conflicts of interest.
 However, the terms of the contract
may assume significance if they purport to remove or attenuate the fiduciary
duties.  In both
the <i>Mallesons</i> and <i>Farrow Mortgage Services </i>cases
it was contended that the firm's contract of retainer with their new client
exonerated them from using confidential information
received from their former
client.  However, it was held in both cases that the solicitor's basic duty
remained to avoid a real sensible
possibility of conflict between the
solicitor's duty to keep the former client's information confidential, and his
or her interest
in advancing the second client's case, and the contractual
provision did not overcome the risk that the solicitor might subconsciously
use
the former client's information in the preparation of the new client's case.
<P>

38	In the present case, there is evidence that it was a term of Phillips Fox's
retainer by IRPS that they would be at liberty to
represent and act in the
interests of HIH and pass on to HIH any information received by them in the
course of acting for IRPS (see
esp. the letter of Butler McIntyre and Butler of
22 June 1993).  Given that IRPS had no remaining substantive interest in the
litigation
having regard to its liquidation and the assignment, and that the
liquidator had legal advice at the time, I conclude that this term
of the
retainer was effective as a matter of contract to attenuate the duty of
Phillips Fox.  It is a reasonable inference that McCabes
and Gunson replaced
Phillips Fox on the same attenuated contractual basis, and I so find.
<P>

	<b>Fiduciary Duties</b>
<P>

39	The solicitor-client relationship is undoubtedly a fiduciary relationship.
Indeed it has been described as one of the most important
fiduciary
relationships known to the law:  <i>Mallesons </i>case, at 361.  The
relationship is fiduciary not only where the solicitor and the client are
parties to a contract for the provision
of legal services for a fee, but also
where the solicitor is engaged by a third party to represent the client, for a
fee paid by
the third party - for example where a solicitor is engaged by an
insurer at the insurer's expense to act for the insured in defending
a claim by
a third party:<i>  C I Industries Pty Ltd  v  Keeling</i> (Abadee J, Supreme
Court of New South Wales, 26 March 1997, unreported).  
<P>

40	One consequence of the solicitor/client relationship being fiduciary is that
a solicitor has a duty not to misuse his or her
position to gain a profit
without the client's fully informed consent:<i>  Boardman  v  Phipps</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1966/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20AC%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967]
2 AC 46.</a>  That duty is not in issue here.  Another consequence, more germane to
the present facts, is that the solicitor must avoid
<P>

*	any real sensible possibility of conflict between the duty to serve the
interests of the client and personal interest:<i>  Mallesons </i>case, at 362,
and
<P>

*	any actual conflict between the duty to serve the interests of one client,
and the duty to serve the interests of another client:<i>  Farrington  v  Rowe
McBride &amp; Partners</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20NZLR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 NZLR 83</a>,
<P>

unless the solicitor obtains the unfettered consent of all relevant clients
after fully disclosing all of the material facts, or
the duty is attenuated by
contract, with the relevant client's fully informed consent.  
<P>

41	It is now common to refer to conflicts of the first kind as `conflicts of
interest', and to designate the duty to avoid conflicts
of the second kind as
the solicitor's `duty of loyalty':  see P D Finn, `Conflicts of Interest and
Professional', in <i>Professional Responsibility </i>(Legal Research Foundation
Inc, New Zealand, 1987)<i> </i>p.24ff.  As Finn J points out in that paper, it
has also become common, at least in the United States, further to subdivide
consideration
of the duty of loyalty into consideration of `same matter'
conflicts, where the fiduciary undertakes conflicting duties with respect
to
one matter (such as acting for the vendor and purchaser of land), and of
`separate matter' conflicts, where the conflict arises
out of the fiduciary
undertaking a duty to one client in a matter and a duty to another client in a
separate matter.  Though the
classification is not entirely clear, I presume
that the conflict which arises when a solicitor acts for the insured to defend
a
claim brought by an external party, and for the insurer with respect to the
insured's claim on the policy, is a separate matter conflict.
<P>

42	The duty not to profit out of the fiduciary position and the duties to avoid
conflicts of both kinds very largely overlap with
one another, though there may
be cases where the `conflict rules' apply and the `profit rule' does not and
vice versa:<i>  Ford's Principles of Corporations Law</i> (looseleaf), para
9.020.  Additionally, the same facts may raise questions about both kinds of
conflicts - that is, conflicts of
interest and conflicts between duties giving
rise to a fiduciary duty of loyalty.  Where a solicitor accepts retainers to
act for
two or more clients whose interests may diverge, the potential arises
for a conflict between the duty to one client and the duty
to another.
Additionally, the decision to accept the offer of retainer by the second client
may create a possibility of conflict
between the solicitor's personal interest
in the fee from the second client, and the duty to the first client for whom
the solicitor
already acts.  For the most part, cases about solicitor and
client tend to concentrate on the conflict of duty which arises when
the
solicitor, having a duty to the first client which includes a duty to preserve
the confidentiality of information imparted to
the solicitor by that client,
agrees to act for the second client in circumstances where either the interests
of the clients are
generally inconsistent, or where (more particularly) the
undertaking to act for the second client may create a duty to disclose the
information provided by the first client.  However, in the <i>Mallesons
</i>case, Ipp J emphasised the personal interest of the solicitor rather than
the conflicting duty (at 362).
<P>

	<b>Confidential information and legal professional privilege</b>
<P>

43	The law concerning wrongful disclosure of confidential information overlaps
with these fiduciary principles.  According to Gummow
J in <i>Corrs Pavey
Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collective Customs </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/266.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 266</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2014%20FCR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 14 FCR 434</a>, 443 it is now
settled in order to make out a case for protection in equity of alleged
confidential information, a plaintiff must
satisfy the following criteria:
<P>

	`The plaintiff:  (i) must be able to identify with specificity, and not merely
in global terms, that which is said to be the information
in question, and must
also be able to show that (ii) the information has the necessary quality of
confidentiality (and is not, for
example, common or public knowledge);  (iii)
the information was received by the defendant in such circumstances as to
import an
obligation of confidence;  and (iv) there is actual or threatened
misuse of that information.'
<P>

	As his Honour pointed out in the <i>National Mutual </i>case at 560,
`unconscious plagiarism' can constitute a breach of the equitable duty.
<P>

44	In comparison, the fiduciary principles may apply where there is no misuse
of confidential information, as in <i>Green v Bestobell Industries Pty Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20WAR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] WAR 1</a>, and possibly <i>Canadian Aero Services Ltd v O'Malley
</i>91973)  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1973/1974scr0-592/1974scr0-592.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">40 DLR (3d) 371</a>;  and a misuse of confidential information may occur
where the parties do not stand in a fiduciary relationship, provided that the
information is communicated in such circumstances as to import an obligation of
confidence:  see generally, <i>Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20147%20CLR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 147 CLR 39.</a>  
<P>

45	In the solicitor/client context, information provided by the client to the
solicitor is necessarily subject to an obligation
of confidence satisfying the
third criterion set out above.  This is because of the substantive legal
principle which underlies the
law of legal professional privilege.  In <i>Grant
v Downs </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20135%20CLR%20675" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 135 CLR 675</a>, 685, Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ said:
<P>

	`The rationale of this head of privilege, according to traditional doctrine,
is that it promotes the public interest because it
assists and enhances the
administration of justice by facilitating the representation of clients by
legal advisers, the law being
a complex and complicated discipline.  This is
does by keeping secret their communications, thereby inducing the client to
retain
the solicitor and seek his advice, and encouraging the client to make a
full and frank disclosure of the relevant circumstances to
the solicitor.'
<P>

46	Similarly in the <i>Baker v Campbell </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20153%20CLR%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 153 CLR 52</a> Deane J said (at
115-6)
<P>

	`The principle underlying legal professional privilege is that a person should
be entitled to seek and obtain legal advice without
the apprehension of being
prejudiced by subsequent disclosure of confidential communications...'. 
<P>

47	The absolute nature of the solicitor's duty of confidentiality was
reinforced in <i>R v Derby Magistrate's Court </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 487</a>, where Lord
Taylor of Gosforth CJ said (at 505) that once the privilege is established, the
lawyer's mouth is `shut for ever'.
<P>

	<b>Duty to the court</b>
<P>

48	In addition to fiduciary duties and the duty not to misuse confidential
information, a solicitor who acts in litigation owes
a relevant legal duty to
the court, as well as an ethical duty.  The duty to the court arises from the
court's concern that it should
have the assistance of independent legal
representation for the litigating parties:  see D A Ipp, `Lawyers' Duties to
the Court'
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20114%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 114 LQR 63</a>, 93.  In the realm of conflicts of interest and
conflicts of duty, the solicitor's duty to the court may not be much different
from
his or her fiduciary duties to former and present clients.  However, the
duty to the court tends to be expressed in such a way as
to emphasise the
public interest in preserving confidence in the administration of justice, and
therefore in the appearance as well
as the reality of independence, and the
court's practical approach to its supervisory discretions:  <i>Freuhauf Finance

	<b>Ethical duties expressed in self-regulatory rules</b>
<P>

49	Finally, barristers and solicitors are subject to ethical duties which find
expression in rules of the professional bodies to
which they are required to
belong.  Those rules tend to reflect the fiduciary standards, though they are
enforced by self-regulatory
bodies through the sanctions available to such
bodies, and the rules tend to articulate professional duties in more specific
terms
than the general law.  For example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 87</a> of the Rules of the New South
Wales Bar Association states that a barrister must refuse a brief for
instructions to appear before
a court if the barrister has information which is
confidential to any other party in the case and the information may, as a real
possibility, be helpful to the prospective client's case.  In some States,
these rules have been reinforced by statute (eg <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act, 1987</a>
(NSW)), thereby outgrowing their self-regulatory origins.
<P>

50	No issue has been raised with respect to such rules in the present
proceedings, and I say no more about them, except to remark
that such rules
were clearly at issue in some of the reported cases:  for example,
<i>O</i>'<i>Reilly v Law Society of New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2024%20NSWLR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 24 NSWLR 204</a>;
<i>Watson v Watson&#184; </i>cited<i> </i>above.
<P>

	<b>The case law on solicitor and client conflicts</b>
<P>

51	The Australian law on solicitor/client conflicts now begins with <i>Rakusen
v Ellis Munday &amp; Clark </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%201%20Ch%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] 1 Ch 831</a> and critiques of that case.  In
<i>Rakusen's</i> case the English Court of Appeal held that there was no
general rule that a solicitor who had acted for a person on one side of
litigation
could never act on the other side;  and that in the case before the
court there was no danger of breach of confidence if one partner
in the
defendant firm acted for a company in an arbitration, after another partner had
advised the claimant against the company in
respect of the claim which was the
subject of the arbitration.  Cozens-Hardy MR said (at 835) that before the
court would allow the
`special jurisdiction over solicitors' to be invoked, it
must be satisfied that `real mischief and real prejudice will in all human
probability result if the solicitor is allowed to act'.  Fletcher Moulton LJ
said (at 841) that the court would not interfere unless
the case was one where
`mischief is rightly anticipated'.  In his Lordship's view, the question for
the court was whether there was
such a probability of mischief that the court
should conclude, in the performance of its duty as holding the balance between
the
high standard of behaviour which it requires of its officers and the
practical necessities of life, that it ought to interfere and
say that the
solicitor must not act.
<P>

52	If one examines the submissions put to the Court of Appeal as well as the
reasons given by their Lordships, it is far from evident
that the case was
argued in terms of fiduciary principles.  <i>Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie Bros
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281854%29%201%20Macq%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1854) 1 Macq 461</a>, then the leading authority on fiduciary duties, was not
cited.  Indeed, lawyers of that time - well prior to the development of
modern
scholarship on the law of fiduciary relationships - may not have regarded it as
relevant:  see L S Sealy, `Fiduciary Obligations,
Forty Years On',  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%209%20Journal%20of%20Contract%20Law%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 9 JCL
37.</a>  In part, counsels' submissions addressed questions about wrongful
disclosure of secrets.  Part of their Lordships' reasoning appears
to be
directed to the proposition that there was no basis on the facts for
apprehending that the defendants would wrongfully misuse
the confidential
information which one of them possessed.  Part of the reasoning seems to relate
to the defendants' duty to the court
as its officers, and consequently the
court's duty in holding the balance between the standard of behaviour which it
requires of
its officers and the practical necessities of life.
<P>

53	In the <i>Mallesons</i> case at 361-2, Ipp J identified two approaches to
the law, one taken by the Court of Appeal in <i>Rakusen</i> and another taken
by Lilley CJ in <i>Mills v Day Dawn Block Gold Mining Co Ltd</i> [1882] 1 QLJ
62.  In the latter case Lilley CJ said (at 63) that it was the duty of an
attorney not to place himself in such a relation
as might lead to there being
even an unwitting breach of duty.  Ipp J preferred the latter approach to the
former, concluding (at
362) that `public interest considerations require that a
solicitor be restrained from acting for a former client where there is real
and
sensible possibility that the solicitor's duty and interest might conflict.'
Another way of getting to Ipp J's conclusion would
be to say that
<i>Rakusen</i> should not be treated as a case about fiduciary principles at
all, but rather as a case confined to the duty of solicitors to the
court,
which appears to be more practical and discretionary than modern fiduciary law,
and to the law of misuse of confidential information.
 
<P>

54	Bryson J's discussion of the law in <i>D &amp; J Constructions Pty Ltd v
Head</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20NSWLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 9 NSWLR 118</a> also appears to me to be directed to the
solicitor's duty to the court.  He declined to adopt a rigid rule, saying (at
123) that
`in deciding the degree of control which it should adopt, each court
must to some extent interpret its own times and manners and
the conduct which
it should expect or even fear from its practitioners'.  That would explain his
Honour's view that a particularly
careful approach should be taken in family
law matters, as family litigation tends to be about highly confidential facts
and a very
wide range of circumstances can conceivably be relevant.  Similarly,
his Honour's reference to the `cautious approach' that the court
should take to
any proposal that it should allow the solicitor to act against a client (at
122) and his concern about the appearance
of the matter to a reasonable
observer (at 123) - distinctly not a characteristic consideration in the
application of equitable doctrines.
 When his Honour turned (at 124) to examine
whether there was a case for protection of confidential information, he appears
to have
applied the law of confidential information rather than the fiduciary
principles.
<P>

55	If this analysis is correct, then the <i>Mallesons</i> and <i>Farrow
Mortgage Services </i>cases do not signify judicial disagreement with the law
stated in <i>Rakusen</i> and <i>D &amp; J Constructions</i>, but rather a
judicial insistence upon the supervening importance of a different legal
doctrine, namely the broad modern law of fiduciary
duties.  Theoretically,
there may still be cases where a solicitor's duty to the court would prevent
him or her from acting though
no breach of fiduciary duty is involved -
especially given that fiduciary principles emphasise the real possibility of
conflict in
the subjective circumstances, while the duty to the court takes
into account the objective appearance of independence as well.  Again,
theoretically, there may be cases where information in the hands of a solicitor
is subject to a duty arising out of the law of confidential
information but its
use falls outside fiduciary principles - perhaps, where the solicitor receives
the information in confidential
circumstances from a third party, while acting
in the former client's interest.  But in almost all real situations, one would
expect
that the modern fiduciary principles would be at least as restrictive
upon the solicitor's freedom to act as either the duty to the
court or the law
of confidential information, and probably more restrictive.
<P>

56	The injection of fiduciary principles may also explain Gummow J's remarks in
the <i>National Mutual </i>case.  His Honour quoted with approval Finn J's
critique of <i>Rakusen</i> in the article cited above.  One of Finn J's points
of criticism was that the <i>Rakusen</i> rule conflicts with the solicitor's
duty of loyalty.  Finn J also considered whether it would be preferable for the
law to apply
a rebuttable or irrebuttable presumption that a prior retainer has
resulted in the acquisition by the solicitor of confidential information
which
prevents him or her from acting for an interest adverse to the former client
without the former client's consent.  To the extent
that the law presumes,
rebuttably or irrebuttably, that the prior retainer has caused the solicitor to
acquire confidential information
which prevents him or her from acting, one
reaches substantially the same result as through the application of the broader
fiduciary
principles.  If that is so, it seems to me preferable not to rely on
the artificiality of presumptions, but instead to approach the
problem by
analysing the interests and duties involved and assessing in a practical way
the extent of the risk of conflict.  
<P>

57	In <i>Rakusen's </i>case it was held that a solicitor may act for a new
client while keeping secret some information obtained from a former client
which
is relevant to the new client's case.  As indicated earlier, that holding
may relate to the practical duty of the solicitor to the
court rather than to
the modern law of fiduciary duties.  But if it is taken as a statement of the
law of fiduciary duties, it must
now be regarded as incorrect.  In <i>Spector v
Ageda</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20Ch%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] Ch 30</a>, 32 Megarry J said:
<P>

	`A solicitor must put at his client's disposal not only his skill but also his
knowledge, so far as is relevant;  and if he is
unwilling to reveal his
knowledge to his client, he should not act for him.  What he cannot do is to
not act for him.  What he cannot
do is to act for the client and at the same
time withhold from him any relevant knowledge that he has.'
<P>

58	That proposition appears to have been accepted by Gummow J in the
<i>National Mutual </i>case, at 560, and by Ipp J in the <i>Mallesons </i>case
at 370, which was in turn followed by Hayne J in the <i>Farrow Mortgage
Services </i>case (at 5).  Therefore, the potential conflict between the duties
to the former and new clients cannot be avoided by asserting, as
a proposition
of law, that the duty to the new client is qualified by performance of the duty
to the former client.  However, it
is open to the parties to attenuate the
fiduciary duty or for the client to waive any non-compliance, provided in each
case that
the client gives informed consent.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Solicitor acting for insurer and insured</b>
<P>

59	I turn now to consider the application of these various legal principles to
the insurance context.  It is not uncommon for the
same firm of solicitors to
act for both the insured and the insurer, representing the insured with respect
to the external claim
which has led the insured to invoke the policy, and
advising the insurer as to whether it should respond under the policy.  Nor is
the solicitor necessarily open to criticism in doing so.  As the Hon John
Brownie QC recently remarked (`Traps Involved When Solicitors
Act for the
Insured as well as the Insurer', a paper presented for the Australian Insurance
Law Association,<i> Spotlight on Insurance Issues</i>, 4 June 1998), `the mere
fact that the insurer is still investigating whether or not to grant indemnity
does not mean that the insurer
may not choose to instruct solicitors to
represent the insured in the meantime'.  He continued, however, that `there
comes a time
when, having investigated, the insurer must elect whether or not
to continue to fund the defence of the insured'.  He referred to<i> ACN 007 838
584 Pty Ltd  v  Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd</i> (unreported, Supreme Court
of South Australia (Olsson J), 28 August 1997).  Other cases in which similar
issues have been explored
are <i>Kennedy v Cynstock Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/NTSC/1993/98.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] NTSC 98</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%203%20NTLR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 3 NTLR
108</a>;  <i>C I Industries Pty Ltd v Keeling </i>(Supreme Court of new South
Wales, Abadee J, unreported,  26 march 1997);  <i>Mytton's Ltd v Phillips Fox
</i>(Supreme Court of Victoria, Coldrey J, unreported, 23 September 1997);
Y<i>unghanns v Elfic Ltd </i>(Supreme Court of Victoria), Gillard J,
unreported, 3 July 1998).
<P>

60	In the present case Phillips Fox in Sydney and Griffits and Jackson in
Hobart acted for the insured as defendant to the external
claim and for the
insurer as defendant to the insured's claim on the policy with respect to the
external claim.  In the case of Phillips
Fox, this conduct occurred after the
firm had advised the insurer not to indemnify the insured under the policy with
respect to the
external claim.
<P>

61	If IRPS had remained a solvent, active protagonist, a point would have been
reached, probably before the commencement of proceedings
by IRPS to enforce the
policy against HIH, at which HIH would have been required to elect whether to
continue to fund IRPS's defence
to Oceanic's claim.  Once that point had been
reached, the same solicitors could no longer continue to act for both the
insured on
the external claim and the insurer on the insured's claim under the
policy.  The present case is made complicated by the fact that
IRPS went into
liquidation very early, before any relevant legal proceedings were instituted
in Tasmania, and then its liquidator
assigned the right of recovery under the
policy to the external claimant Oceanic, and in due course IRPS ceased to be
represented
in the Tasmanian proceedings and default judgment was entered
against it.  In those circumstances, do any of the legal principles
concerning
fiduciary duties, the solicitor's duty to the court, and the duty not to misuse
confidential information, require that
McCabes and Gunson must cease to act, or
that they must deliver up confidential information?
<P>

62	As far as conflict of interest, the duty of loyalty and the duty with
respect to confidential information are concerned, it seems
to me that Gunson
are in no different position from McCabes, and therefore I propose to analyse
the position of McCabes on the assumption
that my conclusions will apply to
Gunson as well.  For the reasons already given, I do not propose in this case
to deal with the
duty of Gunson or McCabes to the court.
<P>

<b>The conflict of interest principle, and the duty not to misuse confidential
information, in the present case</b>
<P>

63	According to the <i>Mallesons</i> case, the conflict of interest principle
requires that a solicitor be restrained from acting for a new client (in this
case HIH),
if there is a real and sensible possibility that the solicitor's
interest in advancing the case of the new client might conflict
with his or her
duty to keep information given to him or her by the former client (in this
case, IRPS (In liq)) confidential, or
with the duty to refrain from using that
information to the detriment of the former client (at 362-3).  In the
<i>Mallesons</i> case the potential conflict arose because the solicitors had
obtained information from a partner in an accounting firm in the course
of
advising him with respect to some transactions, and subsequently the solicitors
were retained by the Commissioner of Corporate
Affairs to act on the criminal
prosecution of the former client in respect of some of those transactions.  Ipp
J found that although
similar information had been obtained by the Commissioner
independently, the information in the solicitor's hands was likely to be
valuable to the Commissioner in preparing for the trial, and the accused would
be prejudiced because of the incalculable effect upon
his state of mind and
demeanour caused by knowing that his former solicitor was now acting for the
prosecution<i>.  In Marriage of A and B </i>(1990) FLC para 92-126 was a
similar case of real practical possibility of conflict.
<P>

64	The present circumstances are very different from the facts of
<i>Mallesons</i> case, but the case shows that the court must make a practical
assessment of the risk of conflict, while being very alert to the possibility
that it may arise where a solicitor ceases to act for one client and begins to
act for another in the same or a related matter. 

<P>

65	Assume for the time being that there had been no assignment.  Then the
question would have been whether the commencement of the
liquidation of IRPS
and ultimately the default judgment against it removed any real sensible
possibility of conflict between the
duty of McCabes to IRPS and its interest in
advancing the case of HIH.  McCabes' duty to IRPS arose when it replaced
Phillips Fox
as the solicitors for IRPS in May 1995.  
<P>

66	A real sensible possibility of conflict may have arisen out of McCabes'
acting for IRPS in any of several ways.  First, if IRPS
provided information to
McCabes by a communication protected by legal professional privilege, that
information would be confidential
and McCabes would be under a duty not to
disclose it to HIH.  There would be at least a possibility that this duty of
confidentiality
would conflict with McCabes' interest in advancing the case of
HIH. 
<P>

67	In the present case IRPS claimed against HIH under the policy in respect of
the external claim made against it by Oceanic.  In
those circumstances IRPS was
under a duty of utmost good faith to disclose to HIH all material facts
relevant to the assessment of
the policy claim:  see E R Hardy Ivamy,
<i>General Principles of Insurance Law </i>(5th ed., 1986), p.408.  That
obligation of disclosure extended, to the extent that they were material (and
therefore capable of giving
rise to a real sensible possibility of conflict) to
all information relevant to any aspect of the consolidated Tasmanian
proceedings,
since all of the issues in the Tasmanian proceedings going to
whether IRPS is liable to Oceanic, Oceanic is guilty of contributory
negligence
and IRPS's liability falls within the policy, are relevant to the assessment of
the insurance claim.  
<P>

68	The existence of a duty upon IRPS to disclose material information to HIH
would not extinguish or qualify the duty of confidentiality
which the law
imposed upon McCabes in respect of information disclosed to them by IRPS.  As
its solicitor, McCabes should have (and
presumably did) advise IRPS that it
must disclose to HIH any material information in the possession of McCabes.
But McCabes was not
at liberty to usurp IRPS's role and make direct disclosure
itself, unless it was specifically authorised to do so.  
<P>

69	The evidence does not identify the information provided by IRPS to McCabes,
nor the information which IRPS provided directly
to HIH.  However, given that
in all probability the information which McCabes received while acting for IRPS
was wholly information
which IRPS was obliged to disclose to HIH, that the
liquidator consented in 1993 to HIH's  then solicitors passing the information
on to HIH, and that the liquidator of IRPS acquiesced in McCabes no longer
acting for that company without making any arrangements
to protect information
which had been disclosed to McCabes, it is appropriate to infer that IRPS
consented to McCabes passing on
any such information to HIH in discharge of its
duty of disclosure.  In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that IRPS failed
to
discharge its contractual duty of disclosure to HIH, and therefore no
evidence to suggest that there was any information in the hands
of McCabes as
the solicitor of IRPS which was not supplied by or with the authority of IRPS
to HIH.  In all these circumstances,
I conclude that there is no real sensible
possibility of conflict between the duty of McCabes not to disclose information
supplied
to it by IRPS and the interest of McCabes in advancing the case of
HIH.  
<P>

70	It also follows from this conclusion that there is no evidentiary basis for
concluding that McCabes have wrongfully disclosed
confidential information or
that there is a ground for apprehension that they may do so.
<P>

71	A conflict of interest may arise even if the solicitor possesses no
confidential information of the former client.  A conflict
may arise simply
because the advancement of the case of the new client prejudices an interest of
the former client which the solicitor
has accepted a continuing duty to
protect, notwithstanding ceasing to act for that client.  In the present case,
even if there were
some continuing duty of McCabes to protect the interests of
IRPS, my opinion is that there is no real sensible possibility of conflict
of
interest in the events which have happened.  Since IRPS is in liquidation, only
its creditors and contributories have a real interest
in the outcome of the
Tasmanian proceedings.  As a practical matter, their interest would potentially
arise if Oceanic is successful
in obtaining a judgment for damages against
IRPS, but unsuccessful  in establishing liability of HIH under the policy.  But
in that
event, the verdict against IRPS ought not to affect the interests of
the creditors of IRPS, since Oceanic's claim to recover unliquidated
damages
would rank below them in any distribution upon winding up:  see <i>Page v
Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1935/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] NSWStRp 70</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2036%20SR%28NSW%29%2085" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 36 SR(NSW) 85</a>, 101;  and the
judgment of Zeeman J on the application under s 500(2) of the Corporations Law
for leave to proceed against IRPS in
liquidation, 27 August 1993 page 4.  The
interests of the contributories in IRPS rather than the creditors could be at
stake, if
there are surplus assets in the winding up, though there is no
evidence before me on this matter.  Enforcement of Oceanic's judgment
against
IRPS would deplete any such surplus.  But the leave granted by Zeeman J on 27
August 1993 was granted upon Oceanic's undertaking
not to enforce a judgment
against IRPS without leave, the purpose of the leave evidently being to permit
Oceanic to seek recovery
from HIH under the policy.  Given Zeeman J's reasons
for judgment, it appears to me unlikely that leave would be granted to permit
enforcement of a judgment against IRPS. 
<P>

72	Having regard to those considerations, my opinion is that there is no real
sensible possibility of conflict between any duty
of McCabes to act in the
interests of the contributories of IRPS and its interest in advancing the case
of HIH.  Moreover, even if
there were any such possibility of conflict prior to
October 1997, that possibility effectively came to an end when default judgment
was entered against IRPS, which was by that time unrepresented.  
<P>

73	My conclusion, therefore, is that there would have been no real sensible
possibility of conflict between McCabes' duty to IRPS
and their personal
interest in advancing the case of HIH, even if there had been no assignment of
the right to claim under the policy
by IRPS to Oceanic.  
<P>

74	However, the assignment provides an independent ground for concluding that
there is no real sensible possibility of conflict
of interest in this case.  A
fiduciary relationship is a personal relationship which arises out of one
party's power over another's
affairs, and that party's undertaking to act in
the other's interests:  <i>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical
Corporation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a>, 96-7 (Mason J);  <i>Lac Minerals Ltd v
International Corona Resources Ltd </i> <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989scr2-574/1989scr2-574.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 61 DLR (4th) 14</a>, 61ff (Sopinka
J).  It is hard to see how the benefit of the fiduciary duties which arise out
of the personal relationship of solicitor
and client can be assigned to a
stranger to that relationship, for whom the solicitor has at no stage acted.
Even if the benefit
of fiduciary relationship were inherently assignable, there
is nothing in the deed of assignment dated 30 April 1993 and the supplementary
deed dated 27 July 1993 which suggests the slightest intention to assign that
benefit.  IRPS, to whom any relevant fiduciary duty
is owed, is not a party to
the present proceedings, and Oceanic is a stranger to the fiduciary
relationship of McCabes as solicitor
to IRPS as its client.  It follows that
even if McCabes were under a duty to avoid a conflict of interest which they
had not discharged,
Oceanic would not be in a position to enforce that duty.

<P>

	<b>The duty of loyalty in the present case</b>
<P>

75	My factual conclusions with respect to the duty to avoid conflicts of
interest are also sufficient to dispose of any complaint
based upon the duty of
loyalty. It appears to me, however, that in cases such as the present, a
conflict between duties will not
arise unless there is also a real sensible
possibility of conflict between duty and interest.  This is because, according
to the
reasoning of Ipp J in the <i>Mallesons</i> case, a solicitor has an
interest in advancing the case of the new client as well as a duty to do so.
<P>

76	Since, therefore, I have concluded that there is no real sensible
possibility of conflict between McCabes' interest in advancing
HIH's case and
its duty to IRPS, it follows that there is also no conflict between McCabes'
duty to HIH and its duty to IRPS.  Additionally,
just as the assignment of the
right to claim under the policy was not effective to give Oceanic any right to
complain about a conflict
of interest on the part of McCabes, so also was the
assignment ineffective to give Oceanic any right to claim that McCabes breached
its fiduciary duty of loyalty to IRPS.
<P>

	<b>Conclusions </b>
<P>

77	For these reasons, my opinion is that Oceanic has not made out any
entitlement arising out of the law of fiduciary duties which
would support
injunctions to restrain HIH from retaining McCabes and Gunson, or to restrain
McCabes and Gunson from acting for HIH.
 Therefore the claims to the relief in
paragraphs 1-3 of the summons are unsuccessful. Whether there is a basis for
the Supreme Court
of Tasmania to enforce the direct duty of Gunson to that
court and the indirect duty of McCabes as principal solicitor, is a matter
which should not be dealt with in proceedings in this Court.
<P>

78	Oceanic is not entitled an order to restrain McCabes and Gunson from
disclosing to HIH information which they obtained whilst
acting for IRPS
(paragraph 5), since the principles of the law of fiduciary relationships and
wrongful disclosure of confidential
information which might support such relief
are not attracted in the present case.
<P>

79	Paragraphs 4, 5A and 6 of the summons seek relief with respect to documents
protected by legal professional privilege and the
`without prejudice' rule of
privilege.  For the reasons which I have given, my opinion is that it is
inappropriate for these matters
to be dealt with in the present proceedings, as
opposed to a motion in the consolidated Tasmanian proceedings.  Paragraph 7 in
the
summons seeks consequential relief for the delivery up of documents, and it
follows from what I have said that this relief will not
be granted.
<P>

80	I therefore propose to dismiss the summons.  While I shall hear the parties
on the question of costs, I am disposed to order
that costs should follow the
event in the normal way.
<P>
