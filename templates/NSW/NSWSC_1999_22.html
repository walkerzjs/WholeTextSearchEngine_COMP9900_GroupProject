<b>50304/94	<u>STRATA CONSOLIDATED (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD &amp; 2 ORS  v  EDWARD
JOHN BRADSHAW &amp; 13 ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1.	In the course of these reasons, reference is made to the reasons for
judgment of 27 November 1997 as the principal judgment and
to the reasons for
judgment of 24 April 1998, as the supplementary judgment.  I have continued to
use the references adopted in those
two reasons for judgment.
<P>

2.	The orders made in the course of delivering the supplementary judgment were
the following:
<P>

"2A.	The Court enquire into and take an account of profits by the first,
second, third, seventh and ninth defendants derived through
the exploitation of
the Selectrons process.
<P>

B.	The Court enquire into and take an account of profits by the first, second,
third, fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh
defendants derived
through the exploitation of the Lansec-Xelux distributorship rights.
<P>

C.	The fifth defendant pay the plaintiffs damages for passing off in the sum of
$230,000 together with interest thereon at Court
schedule rates from 1 January
1994.
<P>

D.	The third, fifth, tenth and eleventh defendants pay the plaintiffs damages
for the breaches referred to in paragraphs 1F of these
orders, in the said sum
of $230,000 together with interest thereon at Court schedule rates from 1
January 1994.
<P>

E.	The Summons be dismissed against the fourth, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth and
fourteenth defendants and judgment be entered in
favour of each of those
defendants.
<P>

F.	Except as otherwise ordered, the summons be dismissed.
<P>

G.	The third, fifth, tenth and eleventh defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of
the proceedings against those defendants for passing
off and for proscribed
conduct within the meaning of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth).
<P>

H.	The plaintiffs pay the fourth, sixth, thirteenth and fourteenth defendants'
costs of the proceedings.
<P>

I.	The plaintiffs and the twelfth defendant pay their own respective costs of
the proceedings between them.
<P>

J.	The plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs of issues in respect of which the
summons stands dismissed.
<P>

K.	The general costs of the proceedings, including the costs of the plaintiffs
and of the first, second, third, fifth, seventh,
eighth, ninth, tenth and
eleventh defendants of the proceedings for breach of fiduciary duties of the
first and third defendants
and for the participation by the other named
defendants in those breaches, be reserved pending the completion of the enquiry
into
and taking an account of profits."
<P>

3.	In relation to orders 2 A and B, the basis upon which accounts should be
taken were summarised at page 309 of the principal judgment
and page 9 of the
supplementary judgment.
<P>

4.	I have taken as the starting point in the taking of accounts in this case
that stated in the principal judgment (at 288-290),
citing <b>Warman</b>,
significantly a case of an account of profits derived by an errant fiduciary.
It offers some consolation to a tribunal afflicted
with the task of taking an
account of profits to note the observation in the joint judgment of Mason CJ,
Brennan, Deane, Dawson,
and Gaudron JJ (the joint judgment) that the "remedy is
ancient and notoriously difficult in practice" (at 556), citing <b>Dart
Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20179%20CLR%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 179 CLR 101</a> as a case
illustrating some of those difficulties.  However, in referring to <b>Dart</b>,
an account of profits case arising out of an infringement of patent, the joint
judgment noted that "the liability of a fiduciary
to account differs from that
of an infringer in an intellectual property case" the purpose of which in the
latter case was "to prevent
the defendant's unjust enrichment" (at 557),
whereas, in the case of a fiduciary, the liability does not depend upon the
detriment
to the person to whom the duty is owed.  Consequently, it was
observed in the joint judgment as follows:
<P>

"A fiduciary must account for a profit or benefit if it was obtained either (1)
when there was a conflict or possible conflict between
his fiduciary duty and
his personal interest, or (2) by reason of his fiduciary position or by reason
of his taking advantage of
opportunity or knowledge derived from his fiduciary
position."
<P>

(at 557.5)
<P>

5.	The distinction is of importance, in my view, in understanding the
appropriate approach to the taking an account of profits in
this case. 
<P>

6.	It was acknowledged in the joint judgment that because "the assessment of
the profit will often be extremely difficult in practice
... (w)hat will be
required on the inquiry ... will not be mathematical exactness but only a
reasonable approximation" (at 558) and
that it was necessary "to keep steadily
in mind the cardinal principle of equity that the remedy must be fashioned to
fit the nature
of the case and the particular facts" (at 559), drawing from the
judgment of Fletcher Moulton LJ in <b>In re Coomber; Coomber v Coomber
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%201%20Ch%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 1 Ch 723</a> at 728-729 and of Deane J in <b>Chan v Zacharia
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%2d1984%29%20154%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983-1984) 154 CLR 178</a> at 195.  In <b>Coomber</b>, Fletcher Moulton LJ
expressed the view that:
<P>

"There is no class of case in which one ought more carefully to bear in mind
the facts of the case ... than cases which relate to
fiduciary and confidential
relations and the action of the Court with regard to them".
<P>

(at 728-729)
<P>

7.	The importance of this approach was recognised by McLelland J in <b>United
States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20766" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 766</a> at 817 where the following statement of principle is
made:
<P>

"The liability of a person who knowingly participates in another's breach of
fiduciary duty was discussed by Gibbs J in <i>Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC
Estates Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20132%20CLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 132 CLR 373</a>, at pp 395-398 where the earlier
authorities from <i>Barnes v Addy </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%20LR%209%20LRCh%20App%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) LR 9 Ch App 244</a> onwards are
examined.  In my opinion the principal to be derived from those authorities is
that a person who knowingly participates
in a breach of fiduciary duty by
another may be both (i) liable to account to the beneficiary for any benefit he
has received as
a result of such participation and (ii) jointly liable with the
fiduciary in respect of any pecuniary liability of the fiduciary
to the
beneficiary as a result of the breach.  In the application of this principal
the court will have regard to the particular
circumstances of the case to
ensure that the relief granted accords with the requirements of justice and
good conscience, with particular
attention to the nature and degree of
participation by, and the degree of knowledge of, the person sought to be made
liability, the
nature of the fiduciary duty involved and the nature and
circumstances of the breach thereof."
<P>

8.	Pertinent to the facts of this case, which have been recounted at
considerable length in the principal judgment, the joint judgment
contained the
following observation:
<P>

"In the case of a business it may well be inappropriate and inequitable to
compel the errant fiduciary to account for the whole
of the profit of his
conduct of the business or his exploitation of the principal's goodwill over an
indefinite period of time. 
In such a case, it may be appropriate to allow the
fiduciary a proportion of the profits, depending upon the particular
circumstances.
 That may well be the case when it appears that a significant
proportion of an increase in profits has been generated by the skill,
efforts,
property and resources of the fiduciary, the capital which he has introduced
and the risks he has taken, so long as they
are not risks to which the
principal's property has been exposed. Then it may be said that the relevant
proportion of the increased
profits is not the product or consequence of the
plaintiff's property but the product of the fiduciary's skill, efforts,
property
and resources.  This is not to say that the liability of a fiduciary
to account should be governed by the doctrine of unjust enrichment,
though that
doctrine may well have a useful part to play; it is simply to say that the
stringent rule requiring a fiduciary to account
for profits can be carried to
extremes and that in cases outside the realm of specific assets, the liability
of the fiduciary should
not be transformed into a vehicle for the unjust
enrichment of the plaintiff ... Whether it is appropriate to allow an errant
fiduciary
a proportion of profits or to make an allowance in respect of skill,
expertise and other expenses is a matter of judgment which will
depend on the
facts of the given case.  However, as a general rule, in conformity with the
principle that a fiduciary must not profit
from a breach of fiduciary duty, a
court will not apportion profits in the absence of an antecedent arrangement
for profit-sharing
but will make allowance for skill, expertise and other
expenses." 
<P>

(at 561-562)
<P>

9.	After reviewing the facts, which bear some superficial similarity to the
facts of this case, the joint judgment concluded that
the errant fiduciaries
"should be ordered to account on the basis of the approach less favourable to
them ... for the entirety of
the net profits of the businesses before tax less
an appropriate allowance for expenses, skill, expertise, effort and resources
contributed
by them" (at 568).
<P>

10.	The facts of this case, in my view, require that in making "all just
allowances" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Pt 48</a> r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules), as stated in the principal
judgment (at 290), those "just allowances" should include allowances
for any
"expenses, skill, expertise, effort and resources contributed" by the
defendants and applied towards the generating of any
profits derived from
exploiting the Selectrons agency and the Translight-Xelux agency (the
agencies).  
<P>

11.	The relevant findings in the principal judgment relating to the Selectrons
agency are to be found at pages 9 to 29 of that judgment.
 For convenience of
reference, the concluding finding in respect of the Selectrons agency, is
repeated below:
<P>

"I think the principles to be applied in such a case are to be found in
<b>Queensland Mines Ltd v Hudson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=18%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">18 ALR 1</a> at 3 and 4 and that the
resolution of this issue comes down to a question of onus.  I am not satisfied
that Bradshaw and Ney obtained
the full and informed consent of Strata to
acquire the agency rights of the Selectrons process.  Without that consent, I
consider
myself bound to find that they acted in breach of their fiduciary and
director duties to Strata.  I express the finding in those
terms as it seems to
me unduly harsh to reach such a conclusion in the face of the reasonable
satisfaction that I have that Strata
(Biady) was not interested in the process:
was not prepared to distract itself from its "established business" and was not
prepared
to commit itself to the significant "technical requirements" involved
in making a success of the Selectrons Agency in which the anticipated
rewards
were likely to be modest."
<P>

(at 28-29)
<P>

12.	The findings in the principal judgment in relation to the Translight-Xelux
agency are to be found at pages 29 to 52.  Again,
for ease of reference, there
is set out below the concluding findings in the principal judgment in relation
to that issue.
<P>

"I am satisfied that the failure of the Strata corporations to acquire the
agency rights for the Translight helmet was unrelated
to the activities of
Bradshaw or of Ney and Binney with Sipro.  I think the evidence established
that it was a conscious decision
on the part of McCarthy to go in other
directions in looking at alternatives to the Optrel-Uvex helmet:  that he had
Strata's information
at his disposal concerning the Translight-Xelux helmet had
he chosen to explore that avenue.  As for Biady, I have little doubt that
had
he wished to acquire the Translight-Xelux agency rights for Strata.  It was
open to him to do so either personally or through
McCarthy, whose
responsibility it was to report to Biady on such matters.  The explanation for
Biady's failure to do so, I think,
is likely to be found in the restrictions
imposed upon the Strata corporations under the Strata Uvex share sale agreement
and in
the strained financial position of Strata at that time, as examined in
some detail later in these reasons.
<P>

As to Strata's entitlement to equitable relief, should Strata elect to follow
that course, it is not an appropriate case of treating
Sipro as a constructive
trustee of the Translight-Xelux agency for Strata nor one entitling Strata to
equitable damages.  In my view,
Strata was not harmed by Bradshaw's breaches in
any measurable way.  While it may be said that Bradshaw's provision of
confidential
information to Ney in October 1992 facilitated Sipro's dealings
with Xelux, it did not have the effect of depriving Strata of any
opportunity
to acquire the Translight-Xelux agency rights.  However, that conclusion is not
determinative of any entitlement of Strata
to have an account of profits should
it elect to make such a claim.
<P>

I also have some difficulty in applying standards of fiduciary duty upon the
defendants in respect of this issue so as to confer
equitable relief to Strata
where I am of the opinion that:  
<P>

(a)	Biady had accepted, through the terms of the Strata Uvex share sale
agreement, that Strata Australia would join with Uvex in
a commercial
relationship of mutual support and co-operation and act as the distributor of
the products of Strata Uvex and of Uvex
and that, at least in spirit, the
Strata corporations would only compete with Strata Uvex in retailing those
products;  
<P>

(b)	the failure of Strata to pursue and/or acquire the Translight-Xelux agency
rights was unrelated to the activities of the defendants;
<P>

(c)	there was full knowledge within the Strata corporations to enable them to
pursue and/or acquire those rights had they chosen
to do so; and 
<P>

(d)	Biady had acknowledged that any decision by the Strata corporations to
acquire those rights would have been "ethically" reprehensible,
having regard
to the terms of the Strata Uvex share sale agreement.
<P>

As found later in these reasons, Strata has cause for complaint about the
manner in which the Procus group went about setting up
in competition with
Strata.  However, I have been left in little doubt that Strata's grievance in
relation to that conduct has caused
the Strata corporations to hit out
indiscriminately at the collection of defendants in these proceedings and in a
manner which has
caused me to resist accepting at face value vast portions of
the evidence.  That is not to suggest that I have not experienced comparable
difficulties in accepting the evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants.
Ideally, the findings that I have made in these reasons
call for a plague on
both their houses, referring to the principal protagonists.  Applying concepts
of equitable compensation and
of exemplary damages in those circumstances does
not come easily."
<P>

(at 51-52)   
<P>

13.	It has been submitted on behalf of Strata that "so-called `just allowances'
should not, in the exercise of discretion, be made
in favour of a fiduciary
guilty of conscious wrongdoing".  I think such an approach is at odds with
<b>Warman</b>, particularly so if one considers the orders made in
<b>Warman</b> in the context of the subject conduct of the errant fiduciary.
<P>

14.	However, it was submitted on behalf of Strata that, in any event, in making
any just allowance there was to be excluded any
allowance for fixed costs which
were not increased by the exploitation of the agencies.  This method of
accounting, characterised
as incremental costing, was to be distinguished from
the "absorption" method of accounting which applies to the cost of a product,
for the purpose of identifying its profitability, all costs which contribute to
the ultimate sale of the product.  Rental of leased
premises from which the
subject business is conducted is a good example of an overhead which could be
treated differently by the
incremental and absorption methods.  The absorption
method was favoured by McHugh J in <b>Dart Industries</b>.  However, the
majority in that case adopted the incremental method.  Dr Rodney Ferrier
(Ferrier), the accounting expert retained
by Ney, favoured the absorption
method.  In doing so, in the circumstances of this case, I think he was correct
so as to ensure that
"just allowances" are made.
<P>

15.	Strata has placed great emphasis on the passage in the joint judgment in
<b>Dart Industries</b> which espoused the incremental method of accounting in
the following terms:
<P>

"Where the defendant has forgone the opportunity to manufacture and sell
alternative products it will ordinarily be appropriate
to attribute to the
infringing product a proportion of those general overheads which would have
sustained the opportunity.  On the
other hand, if no opportunity was forgone,
and the overheads involved were costs which would have been incurred in any
event, then
it would not be appropriate to attribute the overheads to the
infringing product.  Otherwise the defendant would be in a better position
than
it would have been in if it had not infringed.  It is not relevant that the
product could not have been manufactured and sold
without these overheads. Nor
is it relevant that absorption method accounting would attribute a proportion
of the overheads to the
infringing product.  The equitable principle of an
account of profits is not to compensate the plaintiff, nor to fix a fair price
for the infringing product, but to prevent the unjust enrichment of the
defendant." 
<P>

(at 114-115)
<P>

16.	However, <b>Dart Industries</b> was an infringement of patent case and, in
my view, is to be distinguished from breach of fiduciary duty cases
(<b>Warman</b> at 557).  As earlier noted, <b>Dart Industries </b>was referred
to in the joint judgment of <b>Warman</b> without reference to this dichotomy
of accountancy costing methods.  I think it is clear from <b>Warman</b> that
the relief ordered had in contemplation the allocation of costs of resources
used in generating the subject profits without
restricting that allowance to
incremental costs.
<P>

17.	Another fundamental difference in the method of calculating profits as
adopted by the parties was described in the submissions
on behalf of Strata as
posing the question "whether profits derived from the Selectrons (agency) and
the (Translight-Xelux agency)
should be calculated on a group basis or
separately for each trading entity".  Robert Bell (Bell), the accountant
retained on behalf
of Strata, carried out his principal calculation on the
group basis, rather than calculating the profit earned individually by the
defendants in relation to the Selectrons agency and the Translight-Xelux agency
separately.  In doing so, I think he was in error,
both as a matter of
accounting principle and as a matter of implementing the orders made in the
supplementary judgment for the taking
of separate accounts.
<P>

18.	As to the practicality of implementing those orders, I am comforted by the
evidence of Ferrier that "the only way to comply
with the requirements of
(those orders) is to prepare separate accounts of profit for each defendant
(the subject of those orders)
from each source".  That is what Ney did.  
<P>

19.	I considered the qualifications of Ferrier as outstanding and his opinion
evidence to be of particular assistance.  He illustrated
the underlying
distortions in the approach of Bell in two ways.  The first was a simple
illustration of the possible consequence
of grouping financial information when
company "A" was trading unprofitably in the subject product and company "B" was
trading profitably.
 Under the grouping method both companies, A and B, were
shown, in this illustration, to be trading profitably.  The table is reproduced

(Ex 145.)
<P>

20.	The illustration is not without practical relevance, as may be seen from an
analysis of the Selmet and Procus financial statements.
 Selmet and Procus were
each engaged in various ways in the exploitation of the agencies.  However, it
is apparent that the agency
activities of Selmet represented the majority of
that company's sales whereas the Translight-Xelux agency activities represented
a small proportion of Procus' sales.  The group accounting approach, clearly,
in my view, carries the likelihood of distortion of
the calculation of any
profits derived by the constituent entities.
<P>

21.	From a practical viewpoint, it is not difficult to understand Strata's
preference for a group accounting approach to the taking
of accounts.  There is
little doubt that Ney has masterminded the establishment and operation of the
Procus group and I am satisfied
that, faced with a choice, Ney would have
selected a commercial course in the structuring of the entities within the
Procus group
to defeat the claims of Strata, much along the lines that I think
Biady has acted to dilute the interests of Ney and Bradshaw in
the commercial
undertakings once exploited by Strata.  
<P>

22.	The way in which Ney has used Lansarc is a very good example of his
manipulative approach to his commercial interests:  although,
in the case of
Lansarc, it appears that considerations other than those related to Strata,
motivated him.  It was Ney's evidence
that the sales of Selectrons products
recorded in Lansarc were "trust sales" which should have been "accounted at the
end of year
back into Selmet".  However, he said that "for the year ended 30
June 1996 (he) omitted to do it."  As for the year ended 30 June
1997, he said
that Lansarc sales were recorded as "nil", the reason for that being that he
"did account for them back into Selmet
in the year ended (30 June) 1997"
(T37.40).  He explained the absence of trust documents and trust income tax
returns because it
was "not a trust in (a) legal sense, it (was) a trust ... in
the form of accounting" (T38.22).  Ney elaborated upon this evidence
in the
following way:
<P>

"HIS HONOUR: Just one or two other questions I thought I would ask, and it may
be helpful if I do it now.
<P>

HIS HONOUR: Q. What was the purpose of introducing Lansarc?
<P>

A.  What happened in 1995, Mr Sheehan got hold of a big job for us from a
company called Austrack in Junee. And that was a planing
a crankshaft out of a
railway engine which belonged to BHP.  Unfortunately the job went wrong and
Selmet lost about 15,000 on it.
And we were under threat of being sued by
Austrack because they were under threat from BHP.
<P>

	I realised that that exposed the whole of what Selmet was doing to going
under, because we were so small, and when companies as
big as BHP and Austrack
say jump, it's a matter of how high. So I decided to move the wholesale and the
sale of the Selmet consumables
into another company, which was known as mainly
as Lansarc.  And because of the litigation  was on foot, I recognised and made
provision
to transfer the sales of the products from Selectrons back into
Selmet.       
<P>

	I used Lansarc because I had already incorporated it for the purposes of the
carbon clean agency that had been obtained.
<P>

Q.  That is really what I was seeking to ascertain from you. That was the
purpose of its introduction in the first place?
<P>

A.  That's right, because I was advised because of the litigation to start a
new company.  The problem I was confronted with was
we had to move those items
or those activities out of Selmet and I didn't want to have to incorporate
another company because there
were enough of them, so I put it into
Lansarc."
<P>

(T73.49-75.12)
<P>

23.	That evidence was expanded further in Ney's cross-examination as
follows:
<P>

"Q.  What would happen then if Selmet was under the attack of this litigation?
What would you have done with the trading and the
profits in Lansarc?
<P>

A.  Looking at it in a practical sense,.  If Selmet had gone under because it
has been sued by Austrack and any profits had been
held in Lansarc, they would
still be there available and if there was any judgment that we had to pay
accounts of profits in relation
to those.  But if they were lost in Selmet,
they would be lost forever and there would be none available to Strata.
<P>

Q.  Tell me this, if Austrack had obtained a judgment against Selmet, you would
have concealed from Austrack, wouldn't you, that,
in fact, the business being
carried on by Lansarc to your mind was still beneficially owned by Selmet?
<P>

A.  I couldn't, because I had done that minute and like all things once you
produce the documents the story comes out.
<P>

Q.  Yes.  You mean as it came out when you produced the minute this morning?
My question was a little bit different.  If Austrack
had obtained a judgment
against Selmet, would you have disclosed to Austrack that the business being
carried on by Lansarc, formally
carried on by Selmet was still beneficially
owned by Selmet and available to satisfy the judgment?
<P>

A.  I wouldn't have volunteered it, but the knowledge would come out when the
minute book had to be produced.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  I don't quite follow that, because the minutes don't reveal
that the activities of Lansarc were being carried on
for the benefit of Selmet,
I think quite to the contrary, and the only recognition that the minutes give
in relation to Lansarc's
activities was that if there was a court order, it
would account appropriately in respect of those activities?
<P>

A.  That's right.  If there had been a--
<P>

Q.  If that's right, then there is no room in these minutes for saying that
Lansarc was carrying on the activities for the benefit
of Selmet?
<P>

A.  No, but from the timing point of view if it happened--
<P>

Q.  From a?
<P>

A.  Timing point of view if it happened in 1996, you are quite correct.  If it
happened in 1997, the accounts show that sales had
been transferred back to
Selmet from Lansarc.
<P>

Q.  No, the accounts for 1997, not 1996?
<P>

A.  No.  It happened in 1996.  It wouldn't have showed, but in 1997 it would
have.
<P>

Q.  Yes, but that is not a matter emerging from the minutes?
<P>

A.  No, that's correct.
<P>

BISCOE:  Q.  These minutes have never been discovered in these proceedings at
any stage before, have they?
<P>

A.  No, that's correct.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  It might save time noting in this case that nothing surprises me,
Mr Biscoe.  From either side I suspect, and in this
instance I treat the
evidence as amounting to a movable feast with these takings.  In accepting what
the witness said, if Selmet
had been the subject of litigation, then these
activities would have stayed where they ostensibly were being accounted for,
namely
in Lansarc, and the concept of those activities being conducted for
Selmet if it was not under the threat of litigation is an unacceptable
commercial activity, I would have thought."
<P>

(T84.24-85.35)
<P>

24.	The manner in which Ney allocated accountancy fees in the financial
statements of the defendants is another example of the manipulation
of accounts
by Ney, in this instance, with his eye on the effect of taxation upon entities
within the Procus group.  So much is clear
from the following evidence of Ney
in cross-examination:
<P>

"Q.  For example, you moved all accountancy fees out of Procus in '95 and '96;
I mean by "out" that it paid no accountancy fees
in 1995 and 1996, or I should
say it did not accrue accountancy fees in those years?
<P>

A.  Yes, there was no cost in those years.
<P>

Q.  This was done at will in order to achieve the best possible result for each
of the companies in terms of its tax liability,
is that right?
<P>

A.  Yes, I'd agree with that."
<P>

(T129.4-13)
<P>

25.	I think the same may be said of the way Ney allocated the cost of interest
and, probably, of wages and fees.  Consequently,
Ney's evidence-in-chief that
he did not regard expenses incurred by those entities as "allocable at will to
any specific entity within
the group" requires some qualification.  So any
distrust by Strata of the Procus group's accounts was not without
foundation.
<P>

26.	Nevertheless, I think it was incumbent on Strata to scrutinise the accounts
of the defendants, make any adjustments for distortions
that may have resulted
from Ney's creative accounting and calculate separately for each of the
defendants any profits derived by
them through the exploitation of the
Selectrons agency or the Translight-Xelux agency.  
<P>

27.	Ney presented adjusted accounts which purported to disclose any such
profits so derived by any of the defendants.  Mathematically
there is no
significant challenge by Strata to the correctness of those calculations.
Ferrier "checked the accuracy of ... Ney's
figures by reconstructing his model
in the same way as (he) did for ... Bell, and ... reviewed, in general terms,
(Ney's) methodology
and confirmed that (he agreed) with, in principle, the
methodology ... Ney adopted"  (T159.29-34).
<P>

28.	I do not underestimate the difficulty confronting Strata in challenging
Ney's allocations, particularly those involving subjective
accounting decisions
by Ney.  Strata has sought to test those decisions in extensive
cross-examination of Ney and through the evidence
of Carruthers and Sheehan.
Sheehan had been among those Strata salesmen who had defected to Procus in
1993.  His evidence in the
main proceedings was reviewed in the principal
judgment (at 209-211).  In the proceedings to take account of profits, he was
recalled
by Strata to evidence the manner in which the Procus group operated,
in particular, the personnel engaged, the premises occupied
by entities within
the Procus group, the facilities used and the activities conducted by those
entities.  Carruthers' evidence was
to like effect.
<P>

29.	In my view, with that evidence available to Strata, there was no
significant obstacle to undertaking a calculation of any profits
derived by
each of the entities within the Procus group on an individual accounting basis
arising out of the exploitation of either
of the agencies.
<P>

30.	The second way in which Ferrier exposed the effect of the underlying
assumptions and methodology in Bell's report was in Annexure
B to the report of
Ferrier of 25 August 1998 (Ex 144) (Ferrier's annexure B).  
<P>

31.	In Bell's report of 6 August 1998, he calculated the "total profits
accruing to Sipro, Procus, Selmet and Lansarc from the sale
of the products"
the subject of the agencies as follows:
<P>

		       <b>$</b>
<P>

1993			   10,873
<P>

1994			   39,157
<P>

1995			   56,613
<P>

1996			   42,763
<P>

1997			  <u> 62,726 </u>
<P>

<b>Total	</b>		 <u> <b>212,132</b></u>
<P>

(Ex HJ)
<P>

32.	In order to arrive at those "profit figures", Bell purported to adopt the
<b>Dart Industries</b>' costing approach by excluding, what he perceived to be,
fixed costs that would have been incurred whether or not any of the constituent
entities were engaged in the sale of the subject products.  In this way, Bell
excluded rent, cost of computer equipment, depreciation
and an item described
as "Treatment of Related Party Expenses".  "Related Party" referred to those
defendants, other than the corporate
entities, the subject of the orders for
the taking of accounts.  He also excluded legal expenses as not directly
related to the sale
of product.  Bell made an allowance for the "opportunity"
costs of interest on funds contributed by one or other of those related
parties.  In the end, Strata disowned this allowance for opportunity interest
and adopted an allowance for "actual" interest.  However,
at the time of
Ferrier's annexure B that change had not taken place.  
<P>

33.	Ferrier described that annexure as one which contained "schedules ... which
express ... Bell's calculations in a format which
makes apparent the
assumptions and methodology adopted by (Bell)".  I doubt if it would prove to
be a rewarding exercise to repeat
the details of Ferrier's annexure B in these
reasons.  It will suffice for my purposes to observe that among other things,
it reveals
that Bell's estimate of "profit" in relation to the sale of the
subject products for the year ended 30 June 1994 converted a net
loss for the
year ended 30 June 1994 on the sale of the subject products, as derived from
the financial statements, into a "profit"
of $39,157.  In simple terms, Bell's
"profit" figure was achieved only by excluding any allocation of the wages paid
to the personal
defendants engaged in relation to the sale of the subject
products.  A similar analysis for the year ended 30 June 1993 was included
in
Ferrier's annexure B.  As Bell had not taken issue in his evidence-in-chief
with Ferrier's annexure B, I sought his comment on
the validity of that
analysis as follows:
<P>

"HIS HONOUR:  Q.  Have you got Dr Ferrier's report of 25 August?
<P>

A.  Yes, I do.
<P>

Q.  Would you go to annexure B, page 1?
<P>

A.  (Witness complied).  Yes.
<P>

Q.  Now, that's an annexure which Dr Ferrier has prepared which he says
expresses your calculations in a format which reveals the
assumptions and
methodology.  Are you aware of that?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  Do you agree that it does just taking, for example, the 1993 analysis that
appears at annexure B, page 1?
<P>

A.  Yes; it shows where we have allocated certain overheads on a ratio of sales
and allocated certain items on a depreciable basis.
<P>

Q.  Perhaps more specifically, it reveals the assumptions and methodology
adopted by you? 
<P>

A.  Yes, it does.
<P>

Q.  I think to be fair, do you see in particular that in relation to your
profit figure of $10,873, how that is comprised in relation
to what I refer to
as related parties?
<P>

A.  Yes, I do.
<P>

Q.  Do you accept that it involves the trading organisations as well as the
individuals?
<P>

A.  No, I don't.
<P>

Q.  Why not?
<P>

A.  What I've done is to calculate.
<P>

Q.  Why not in the light of the analysis that appears at the foot of that
annexure?
<P>

A.  Because there are add-backs in that for wages which shouldn't be added
back, and I've done trading profits of the companies.
<P>

Q.  Do you say the $10,873 is not made up in the way shown at the bottom of
annexure B, page 1?
<P>

A.  It is a way of going about it.
<P>

Q.  Isn't it the way?
<P>

A.  I don't know that it's the way.  In the schedules in my report for each
year--
<P>

Q.  If you go to the last page of your report, you can see what you've done
there is the $10,873.  Have you got that?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  And that justifies, does it not, the manner in which Dr Ferrier has
analysed your $10,873?
<P>

A.  Yes, it does."
<P>

(T191.41-192.37)
<P>

34.	However, as earlier stated, having regard to the circumstances surrounding
the acquisition and operation of the agencies, I
am satisfied that some
allowance must be made by way of an apportionment of the costs of resources
utilised in the sale of the subject
products, even if I was required to find,
on the evidence, that some of the costs of those resources would have been
incurred by
the Procus group in the absence of the acquisition of the
Selectrons agency or of the Translight-Xelux agency.
<P>

35.	In accordance with my directions, Ferrier and Bell met and prepared a joint
report which identified "Areas of Difference" (the
joint report).  In
addressing those differences, it is also necessary to determine the period in
respect of which accounts should
be taken.  Bell's analysis was taken up to the
year ended 30 June 1997.  In the supplementary judgment I deferred a decision
on that
question until I had the opportunity, among other things, of seeing how
Lansarc fitted into the defendants' activities.
<P>

36.	The view I have formed is that some time should be determined, lying
between two and four years from the respective times of
acquisition of the
agencies.  That would place an outside limit of mid 1996 in respect of the
Selctrons agency and mid 1997 for the
Translight-Xelux agency.
<P>

37.	The term of the Selectrons agency was two years with provision for
"automatic" renewal.  The evidence of Ney was that the agency
agreement had
"died" with corporate changes affecting Sifco and for some years, probably from
1993, Selmet had been operating on
an "order by order" basis.  It was also his
evidence that Selmet had not achieved the "yearly ... sales quota (under the
agreement)
... for the first year of operation" and there had been no agreement
reached thereafter on any minimum sales quota.  I think that
description was
probably a reliable one of the practical relationship between Selmet and Sifco
as distinct from the legal relationship
under the Selectrons agency
agreement.
<P>

38.	Having regard to the circumstances of acquisition and the nature of the
subject matter of the Selectrons agency which were the
subject of findings in
the principal judgment, I take the view that three years of any profits should
be accounted for in respect
of the exploitation of the Selectrons agency - that
is to mid 1995.  I think that borders on the generous side of the discretionary
band.
<P>

39.	I think a little in excess of three years is appropriate in respect of the
Translight-Xelux agency, having regard to similar
considerations relating to
the circumstances of acquisition and nature of operation of the agency which
were the subject of findings
in the principal judgment.  That would bring the
accounting period up to mid 1996.  In reaching that conclusion, I have had no
regard
to Ney's evidence that the agency relationship had come to an end by the
beginning of 1998.
<P>

40.	For reasons that follow, the effect of those findings is, in my view, that
on a separate accounting method as presented in Ney's
financial analyses and as
adjusted by Ferrier, the defendants should not be ordered to make any payment
to Strata by way of an accounting
of profits.
<P>

41.	I think the liability of the defendants to account should be treated as
follows:
<P>

(a)	<b>As to the Selectrons agency (July 1992 - June 1995)</b>
<P>

<b>Selmet</b> incurred a loss of $14,074 for the financial year ended 30 June
1993, gained a profit of $1,167 for the year ended 30 June 1994 and
suffered a
loss of $4,226 for the year ended 30 June 1995:  resulting in the incurring of
a net loss for the period of $17,133.
<P>

<b>Ney</b>, in respect of services rendered, incurred a loss of $5,829,
representing lost salary opportunity in the year ended 30 June 1993,
$4,125 for
the year ended 30 June 1994 and profited by $5,604 for the year ended 30 June
1995:  resulting in a net loss for the period
of $4,350.  Unadjusted, Ney
received $10,165 in that period for his services.  
<P>

<b>Siska</b>, on the basis of lost interest opportunity, lost $4,950 in 1993
and $2,692 in 1995, suffering no significant loss in 1994.  Total
loss incurred
for the period was $7,642 (there is a small discrepancy in Ney's summary).
Unadjusted, Siska received $2,940, recorded
as an interest payment.
<P>

<b>Bradshaw</b> received nothing and incurred no losses during this period
other than through his interest in Selmet.  
<P>

<b>Tarkello</b>, on the basis of interest received adjusted for opportunity
costs, benefited by $2,893.  Unadjusted, Tarkello received $8,554 ($8,553
in
Ney's analysis).  However, in my findings in the principal judgment, I did not
accept that the funds made available by Bradshaw,
through Tarkello, for the
acquisition and exploitation of the Selectrons agency were loan funds, rather
capital contribution entitling
Tarkello to a fifty per cent share in Selmet.
Similarly, I regarded Ney and Siska as each entitled to a twenty five per cent
share.
<P>

On those bases, I think it is appropriate to:
<P>

(i)	take Selmet's losses into account in considering the position of Ney,
Bradshaw, Tarkello and Siska;
<P>

(ii)	treat the payment recorded as interest as payments to shareholders in
respect of their separate equities, unadjusted for opportunity
costs;
<P>

(iii)	treat the payments to Ney as payments for services rendered, which
payments, on balance, were less than the market value of
those services.
<P>

The consequence of those approaches is that none of the defendants, in my view,
should be ordered to pay any moneys by way of an
accounting of profits.
<P>

(b)	<b>As to the Translight-Xelux agency (February 1993 to June 1996):</b>
<P>

<b>Sipro:  </b>Although the order to inquire into and take account of profits
was made against Sipro in respect of this agency, the evidence in the
principal
proceedings and in the taking account of profits established that Sipro acted
as wholesaler to the Procus group and operated
in a fashion which ensured that,
for practical purposes, it derived no profits.
<P>

<b>Procus Australia</b>, in respect of the exploitation of this agency,
incurred a loss of $3,300 for the period to 30 June 1993 and of $21,904 for the
year
ended 30 June 1994.  For the years ended 30 June 1995 and 1996, it derived
profits of $2,312 and $1,299 respectively.   For the period
it incurred a net
loss of $21,593.
<P>

<b>Selmet</b> derived a profit of $203 for the year ended 30 June 1994 and
incurred losses of $11,834 and $2,548 respectively for the years ended
30 June
1995 and 1996.  The net losses incurred for the period were $14,179.
<P>

<b>Bradshaw</b> was paid a total of wages or fees for services rendered of
$10,916 in the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996.  This was approximately
equivalent to the opportunity cost of those services.
<P>

<b>Tarkello</b> received $5,331, recorded as interest from Selmet which, if
adjusted for opportunity costs of interest, reduced that sum to $1,893.
 This
should be treated in the same way as interest received from Selmet in relation
to the Selectrons agency.
<P>

<b>Ney </b>received a total of $30,006 for services rendered over the relevant
period, which, if adjusted for opportunity costs, reduced the
sum to $3,610.
The amount of $30,006 included $2,799 paid by Lansarc.
<P>

<b>Siska </b>received $1,164 recorded as interest from Selmet and $5,855, also
recorded as interest from Procus - a total of $7,019, which, if
adjusted for
opportunity costs, converted the figure to a net loss of $7,037.  Having regard
to the findings in the principal judgment,
the payments should be treated as
though they were payments to a shareholder without regard to the opportunity
cost of interest.
<P>

<b>Binney</b> received $7,788 for services rendered (ignoring $243 recorded as
an interest payment).  That payment for services represented an
undervalue.
<P>

<b>Maguire</b> received $2,961 for services rendered (also ignoring a payment
of $612 recorded as an interest payment).  As in the case of Binney,
that
payment represented an undervalue based on opportunity costs of those services.

<P>

42.	Having regard to the findings in the principal judgment as to the nature of
the interests of Ney/Siska, Bradshaw/Tarkello in
either Selmet or Procus
Australia, I think it is appropriate to take into consideration the losses
incurred by those entities which
amounted to $35,772 during the relevant
period.  That figure does not include the Lansarc profit of $3,616 for the year
ended 30
June 1996.  In my view, that sum should be treated as part of Selmet's
trading results in light of the evidence of Ney which, I think,
revealed the
movement of trading into Lansarc as a sham or as an attempt to defeat
contingent directors of Selmet.  
<P>

43.	There is an outstanding application by Strata to join Lansarc as a
defendant in these proceedings.  I deferred ruling on that
application.
Clearly, it is highly undesirable to accede to that application having regard,
alone, to the history of this litigation.
 As it happens, I am satisfied on the
evidence and upon the findings made in these reasons that it is neither
necessary nor desirable
to accede to that application which, accordingly, is
dismissed.  In my view, having regard to those findings, nothing of
significance
would be achieved by joining Lansarc.  By contrast, granting the
application would be likely to occasion significant disruption to
the
finalising of those proceeds with little or no benefit from such joinder.
<P>

44.	The effect of treating the Lansarc trading as that of Selmet is to reduce
Selmet's loss for the relevant period to $10,563 and
the total losses of Procus
Australia and Selmet to $32,156.
<P>

45.	The conclusion I have reached is that, given the close approximation of the
payments for services rendered to the opportunity
costs of those services,
treating interest payments as being payments to shareholders in respect of
their equities without regard
to opportunity costs, and taking into account the
losses suffered by Selmet and Procus Australia over the relevant period, it is
not appropriate to order any of the defendants to make any payments to Strata
by way of an accounting of profits.
<P>

46.	In reaching that conclusion in respect of the defendants' exploitation of
either agency, I accept that the defendants may have
derived some capital
profits.  It is accepted by Strata that there is no basis upon which I could
quantify capital profits in this
case (T204.28).  The way it was put on behalf
of Strata is that, in the taking of accounts, regard may be had to capital
profits
as in <b>Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20155%20ALR%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 155 ALR 134:</a>
that while capital profits have not been quantified in this case, the
likelihood that some of the defendants had derived such profits
was a relevant
consideration in determining the appropriate period for the taking of accounts:
that it would not be just to cut off
the accounting period in the early years
of building up the agencies when losses might be expected and "before the
profit stream
started to come in".
<P>

47.	While it is common ground that the evidence does not permit me to quantify
any such profits, I would add, the evidence does
not permit me to make a
positive finding that capital profits were, in fact, derived by any of the
defendants in respect of either
agency.  On one view of Ney's evidence, there
was no capital profit made.  However, I did not regard Ney's evidence on that
aspect
as satisfactory, lacking support, for the most part, from relevant
contemporaneous records.  It is sufficient to say that I would
not be prepared
to make a positive finding that capital profits had been earned in respect of
either agency.
<P>

48.	In other circumstances than those the subject of findings in the principal
judgment, I would not regard, the ultimate findings
on this inquiry, as a just
or satisfactory result.  However, in a case in which I expressed the view in
the principal judgment that
"ideally, the findings ... call for a plague on
both their houses, referring to the principal protagonists", in my view, the
result
satisfies the demands of equity as formulated in <b>Warman</b>,
<b>Coomber</b> and <b>Hospital Products</b>.  
<P>

49.	It is clear, however, that the parties will not allow this judgment to
collect dust and for that reason I think there is some
utility in making
particular findings on some of the issues raised in this hearing.
<P>

50.	In relation to costs which Bell regarded as not incrementally increased by
the exploitation of the agencies the following findings
are made:  
<P>

51.	<b>Salary and fees payable to Ney, Binney, Maguire and Bradshaw:</b>  The
real issue between the parties is in the divergence of accounting approaches
adopted by Bell and Ferrier.  Bell would make no
allocation for such costs in
the calculation of profits on the basis that their respective contributions to
the exploitation of the
agencies "related to surplus capacity in the four men"
so that "the same wages would have been paid (to them) in any event".  
<P>

52.	It was further submitted by Strata that the allocation of any part of those
costs could not be justified on the basis of lost
opportunity of engagement by
those individuals in alternative activities to those related to the agencies.

<P>

53.	There is no challenge to quantification of the actual salaries and fees
payable to those defendants, as extracted from the financial
statements.  For
the reasons earlier stated, I agree with Ferrier's "absorption" method of
accounting which requires a "just allowance"
for the cost of the contributions
of those defendants in the exploitation of the agencies.  
<P>

54.	Ney has contributed to the dispute with evidence of "opportunity costs"
represented by "the amounts  which could have been earned
had the employment or
other services (provided by the defendants) been provided to third parties".
In Ney's opinion, the value of
the personal defendants' services was greater
than the amount actually paid to them.  I have no difficulty in accepting that
evidence.
 Ferrier and Bell are agreed that the "actual" was $114,025, while
Ney has calculated a cost of those services at $122,022.  I think
the
difference is of little significance.  However, I think it is inevitable, in
the circumstances in which the agencies were acquired
and operated, that the
defendants were prepared to provide services below "market" rates in an
endeavour to get the agencies established
and I regard Ney's evidence on the
value of those services as reliable.  
<P>

55.	Had it called for decision, I would have regarded it necessary in making a
"just allowance" to take into consideration the market
value of the services
provided by the personal defendants.  Otherwise, I think it is clear that the
actual amount paid for the services
of the personal defendants has to be taken
into consideration in determining what profits, if any, were derived by the
defendants
in the exploitation of the agencies.
<P>

56.	<b>Rent:  </b>For the reasons earlier stated, I think an allocation should
be made of the rent paid for so much of Procus' premises occupied by
the
operations of the agencies.  There is a conflict between the evidence of Ney
and  that of Sheehan and Carruthers over the use
of the premises by the
agencies.  Strata allocates nothing by way of rental to the costs of exploiting
either of the agencies.  Strata
contends that the area occupied by the
Translight-Xelux agency took advantage of "surplus capacity" of Procus'
premises.  In the
case of the use of the premises for the Selectrons agency it
is acknowledged by Strata that the area occupied was no more than 15
to 20% of
the premises.  However, it is submitted by Strata that no allocation of rent is
justified as it has not been shown that
premises representing 80 to 85 % of the
area of Procus' premises was available to Procus, or, if smaller premises could
have been
obtained, that a lesser rent would have been payable.  As a matter of
principle, I am of the view, for the reasons earlier stated,
that some
allocation of the cost of rental for the agencies' activities is required.
<P>

57.	In relation to the Translight-Xelux agency, Ney's evidence is that, had
that agency not been acquired, another like agency would
have been obtained in
its stead.  On the principle of accounting espoused by <b>Dart</b> (at 114)
that would be a relevant consideration in bringing to account an allocation of
a fixed overhead such as rent.  I would not
be prepared to find that such an
alternative agency would have been acquired.  
<P>

58.	As to the area actually occupied for the agencies' activities, the evidence
established that Procus moved premises from a location
known as 35 Prime Drive
to one known as 4 St James Place, Seven Hills.  Ney evidenced the areas within
the premises occupied by the
various entities in the Procus group by sketches
of the floor plans for the respective locations which delineated areas by
reference
to usage.  Ultimately, I think there was little divergence in the
evidence of Sheehan and that of Ney, with Sheehan's substantial
acceptance of
the correctness of the sketches produced by Ney.  There remained in dispute an
area used for the Selectrons agency
which was, in part, also used for storage
by a third party and in part used as a communal area.  I do not regard those
matters as
having any measurable significance in determining the reasonableness
of Ney's designation of area usage.   That being so, I regard
the allocation of
rental costs effected by Ney as reasonable.  It is not necessary, in accepting
that allocation, to determine whether
the change from Prime Drive to an area
the size of the St James Place premises was dictated by the need for space for
use in connection
with the Selctrons agency, as Ney maintained.  However, I
accept that in the choice of the St James Place premises, the needs of
Selmet
would have played a role.  Strata submitted that, in any event, the allocation
was unreasonable as it failed to give any weight
to the use of the premises by
Sipro.  However, in my view, that omission does not result in distortion of
allocation of costs.  Sipro's
role was that of wholesale supplier to the Procus
group and it was largely, if not entirely, the creature of the incidence of
sales
tax.  Its trading figures were arrived at by a philosophy aimed at
generating no trading profit.  I think it would be an artificial
exercise to
allocate a portion of rent to the costs of operation of Sipro.
<P>

59.	<b>Depreciation:</b>  The only question in issue is whether, as a fixed
cost, with no measurable incremental costs attributable to the agencies'
activities,
any allocation of depreciation, as adjusted by Ferrier, is
justified.  For the reasons earlier stated, I think the allocation accepted
by
Ferrier is appropriate.
<P>

60.	<b>Software:  </b>This item of expense is in the same category as the cost
of rent:  the only issue being whether, there being no measurable incremental
costs of computer usage in connection with the agencies' activities, any
allowance should be made for computer software costs.  For
the reasons earlier
stated, I am of the view that a just allowance requires an allocation of
computer software costs as assessed
by Ney.  
<P>

61.	<b>Interest:</b>  There was debate about the validity of Ney's allocation
of interest costs on moneys advanced by the defendants for working capital
used
in connection with the agencies.  It was debated under the heading of
"opportunity" costs.  However, it was the evidence of
Ney that there was an
express understanding amongst the defendants that the moneys advanced by them
would carry interest "to recognise
the cost attached to that money" and that a
rate was agreed upon from year to year.  However, he added that the "interest
reflected
in the accounts (did) not take into account the total interest
calculation because (he) tried to maintain a profit level without
running into
loss.  So, therefore, quite often interest accrued into the Procus account, not
the total" (T110).  Bell and Ferrier
are in substantial agreement that interest
costs as agreed to be paid upon moneys advanced for the exploitation of the
agencies should
be allocated as a cost of deriving any profits through such
exploitation.  They have treated these costs as an opportunity cost on
the
basis that they are at variance with the recorded costs of interest in the
financial statements of the entities in the Procus
group.  Strata has disavowed
the validity of such an approach.  
<P>

62.	Having regard to my findings in the principal judgment, I have preferred to
treat those payments not as interest payments, but
as though they were payments
to shareholders in respect of their particular equities.  Had the position been
otherwise, I would have
taken the view that, in the absence of an agreement as
to interest rates, the defendants are entitled to an allocation of interest
costs on the basis of the reasonable cost of any loans by the defendants as
working capital used in connection with the subject agencies.
 I have some
difficulty in accepting that the rates applied by Ney in his allocation of
interest costs were in fact agreed as amongst
the defendants from year to year.
Nevertheless, in my view, the rates as applied may be treated as reasonable for
the purpose of
allocation of costs in the manner accepted by Ferrier and
Bell.
<P>

63.	In disposing of the principal issues raised during this inquiry, I have not
found it necessary to make further findings as to
credit than those expressed
in the principal judgment.  Criticism has been made in these reasons of the
manner in which Ney directed
trading results of Selmet into Lansarc.  There
were other areas in which his evidence was attacked by Strata, principally in
relation
to his explanation of the partial reimbursement by Procus of
Bradshaw's telephone costs for the quarter preceding 2 February 1994
and the
inconsistency of his evidence in this inquiry with his evidence in proceedings
in the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court
in September 1994.  There was such
an inconsistency and his explanation of Procus' reimbursement was not
satisfactory.  It may also
be noted that Lansarc was incorporated in February
1996, that is, prior to the commencement of the hearing of the main
proceedings.
 While there may have been no occasion for Ney to disclose its
existence during those proceedings, I have little doubt that, unless
required
to do so, Ney would have been careful not to draw attention to its existence or
activities.  None of these matters has advanced,
in any measurable way, the
views expressed as to credit in the principal judgment.
<P>

64.	Strata has referred me to the orders made by McLelland J in <b>Hospital
Products</b>.  Those orders included the following:
<P>

"2.   Declare that the second defendant knowingly participated in the aforesaid
breaches by the first defendant of equitable obligations.
<P>

3.   Declare that by reason of the aforesaid breaches by the first defendant
and knowing participation by the second defendant,
the plaintiff was entitled
at its election
<P>

(a)	as against the first and second defendants, to payment of an amount equal
to the profits made by the first defendant by selling
surgical stapling
products other than clinical product manufactured by the plaintiff and sold in
the plaintiff's packages, on the
Australian market between 1st December, 1979,
and 30th November, 1980, such profits to be calculated on the basis that the
cost of
the demonstration product transferred from the Hospital Products
Corporation to the first defendant via the Bellevue Trust and Morust
Ltd is
brought in at the price charged by the Hospital Products Corporation to the
Bellevue Trust, and such payment to be secured
by an equitable lien over the
assets held by the first defendant representing the proceeds of the sale by the
first defendant of
its manufacturing business to the third defendant, or so
much of those assets as the court may think sufficient to secure the said
payment;
<P>

...
<P>

4.   The plaintiff having elected the remedy referred to in (a) of order 3
above, declare that the plaintiff is entitled as against
the first and second
defendants to payment of an amount equal to the profits made by the first
defendant by selling surgical stapling
products other than clinical product
manufactured by the plaintiff and sold in the plaintiff's packages, on the
Australian market
between 1st December, 1979, and 30th November, 1980."
<P>

(at 821)
<P>

65.	It was submitted by Strata that similar orders, imposing joint liability on
the defendants, should be made in this case.  Had
it been necessary to
determine that question I would not have been prepared to make such orders.  It
is important, in my view, to
understand the principles applied by McLelland J
and the particular circumstances which attracted those orders.  Those matters
were
addressed by his Honour in the following terms:
<P>

"There is no doubt that Mr Blackman, under whose complete control and
domination HPI acted at all material times, planned and executed
HPI's breaches
of fiduciary duty and thereby with full knowledge made himself the chief
instrument by which those breaches were carried
out.  The liability of a person
who knowingly participates in another's breach of fiduciary duty was discussed
by Gibbs J in <i>Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20132%20CLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975)
132 CLR 373</a>, at pp 395-398 where the earlier authorities from <i>Barnes v Addy
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%20LR%209%20LRCh%20App%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) LR 9 Ch App 244</a> onwards are examined.  In my opinion the principle
to be derived from those authorities is that a person who knowingly
participates
in a breach of fiduciary duty by another may be both (i) liable to
account to the beneficiary for any benefit he has received as
a result of such
participation and (ii) jointly liable with the fiduciary in respect of any
pecuniary liability of the fiduciary
to the beneficiary as a result of the
breach.  In the application of this principle the court will have regard to the
particular
circumstances of the case to ensure that the relief granted accords
with the requirements of justice and good conscience, with particular
attention
to the nature and degree of participation by, and the degree of knowledge of,
the person sought to be made liable, the
nature of the fiduciary duty involved
and the nature and circumstances of the breach thereof.
<P>

	In the present case the relevant benefits were with one possible qualification
received not by Mr Blackman personally but by HPI.
<P>

...
<P>

On the other aspect of the principal, I am unable to discern any circumstances
in the case which would justify any view other than
that Mr Blackman should be
jointly liable with HPI in respect of the latter's liability as fiduciary
either in respect of HPI's profits
or in respect of USSC's loss, should USSC
elect to pursue either of these remedies, subject to the defence based on the
release of
Mr Blackman, to which I will now turn."
<P>

(at 817)
<P>

66.	I think it is clear from those reasons that McLelland J had "regard to the
particular circumstances of the case to ensure the
relief granted (accorded)
with the requirements of justice ..."  High in the priority of "particular
circumstances" was the "complete
control and domination" over the fiduciary
exercised by the participating party and the fact that he was the "chief
instrument by
which (the fiduciary) breaches were carried out".  These
considerations were at the forefront of the passages earlier quoted from
<b>Warman</b> and <b>Coomber</b>.
<P>

67.	Having regard to the views I have formed as to the conduct of the principal
protagonists in these proceedings, I do not regard
McLelland J's reasoning or
conclusions as at odds with a refusal to impose joint liability on the
defendants had they been ordered
to make payments to Strata by way of an
accounting of profits. 
<P>

68.	Although extensive arguments on the appropriate order for costs have been
addressed to me in the past, I have been requested
to defer final orders as to
costs until the parties have been afforded the opportunity of presenting
submissions as to costs in the
light of my determination on this inquiry into
profits.  Accordingly, the matter will be placed in the list at 9.30am on 11
February
1999 with the view to giving final judgment in these proceedings.
