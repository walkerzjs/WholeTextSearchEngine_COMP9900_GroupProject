JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	In these proceedings, Mr Hadid ("the plaintiff"), as one of two plaintiffs,
sued Australis Media  Limited ("Australis") and Dr
W L Burt.   The claim
against Australis was for damages for breach of contract and against Dr Burt
for breach of warranty of authority.
  I delivered a judgment on 30 June 1997,
in which I held that but for the absence of authority on the part of Dr Burt to
contract
on behalf of Australis there would have been a binding agreement
between Australis and Mr Hadid, and that there was no such authority.
  I held,
accordingly, that there was a breach of warrant for authority by Dr Burt.  (The
claim by the other plaintiff fell away
in the course of the hearing.)
<P>

<b>The claim for costs as damages</b>
<P>

2	Mr Hadid claims to be entitled to recover against Dr Burt, as damages, the
costs of the proceedings against Australis.  That issue
was not resolved in my
judgment of 30 June 1997.   I said in that judgment that, subject to any such
entitlement, Mr Hadid was entitled
to nominal damages only against Dr Burt.  No
orders were made at that stage.   The parties were directed to bring in draft
short
minutes of the orders sought (respectively), on the basis that counsel
would have the opportunity of making further submissions.
<P>

3	At the request of the parties - because, as I understand it, of other current
litigation - the matter was further adjourned several
times and the hearing did
not resume until 14 December 1998.  I heard argument on that day and the
following day, and reserved my
decision.
<P>

4	Although I said in my judgment of 30 June 1997 that the plaintiff would be
entitled to judgment for nominal damages if he was
not entitled to recover the
costs of the proceedings against Australis as damages - no orders having been
made - there was (properly)
no objection to my reconsideration of the point if
that were necessary.
<P>

5	Objection was taken to the claim for costs as damages on the ground that it
was not covered by the statement of claim.  That is
factually so.  The claim
was first raised in the course of final addresses.   The claim was objected to
on the further ground that
the assessment of costs as damages would require
further evidence and, therefore, a reopening of the plaintiff's case.  That is
also
correct.  Furthermore, the ordinary course in hearing such a claim would
be to decide whether the claim was made out in principle
and, if it was, to
refer the assessment of damages to a master of the court.   The plaintiff
argued that the determination of such
a claim in this way would amount to the
determination of a separate question which could only be done by order, which
the plaintiff
would also oppose.   
<P>

6	It appears to me that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced by granting such
amendment as may be necessary to allow this claim
to proceed nor by determining
the additional claim in the way I have mentioned.   Accordingly, I will proceed
on the basis that the
amendment should be allowed and that the claim, if made
out in principle, should be determined in the way I have mentioned.
<P>

7	The incurring of costs which would not otherwise have been incurred, with no
countervailing benefit is capable of constituting
damage in law.  But there is
the question of causation.  I  find that the costs of suing Australis would not
have been incurred but
for Dr Burt's representation of authority.
Notwithstanding that finding, on the facts as found in my judgment of 30 June
1997, I
am not persuaded that the plaintiff incurred the costs of its claim
against Australis as a result of that representation and, accordingly,
as a
result of Dr Burt's breach of warranty of authority.  
<P>

8	The "but for" test is not necessarily sufficient for the determination of
causation in law where more than one factor has contributed
to the damage.  The
test must then be tempered by policy considerations: <i>March v E &amp;M H
Stramare Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%2d1%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990-1) 171 CLR 506</a> (per Mason CJ at 516).  In such
cases, causation is to be determined by a value judgment involving ordinary
notions of language and
common sense:  <i>March</i> (per Deane J at 524).  The
decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation
Limited</i>:<i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 685</a> illustrates the point:- The plaintiff
company claimed damages for trading losses incurred after the auditors ought to
have closed
the company down for non-compliance with ratios prescribed by the
company's debenture deed.  But for the auditors' breach of duty,
the company
would not have incurred the losses because it would not have been trading.  Yet
the losses were found, on appeal, not
to have resulted from the auditors'
breach of duty.  That was because poor management decisions by the company's
directors and adverse
economic conditions were seen as being the only real
cause of the losses suffered by the company after the relevant date.
<P>

9	In the present case, the plaintiff failed to establish that the agreement
with Australis, which would have come into existence
if Dr Burt had had the
requisite authority, would have had a value to the plaintiff.   Furthermore, it
is not shown that, when the
proceedings were instituted and/or for any period
thereafter, there was the prospect of establishing that a contract would have
had
such a value.   In these circumstances, the damage constituted by incurring
the costs of suing Australis, without a countervailing
benefit, cannot
reasonably be seen as having been caused by Dr Burt's breach of warranty of
authority.   The only real cause of such
damage was suing Australis and
maintaining that action without a case for compensatory damages if it were
established that Dr Burt
had the necessary authority to contract.
<P>

10	For these reasons, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover as damages the
costs incurred in suing Australis.
<P>

11	The same reasoning applies to the plaintiffs' liability for Australis' costs
(as to which, see later in this judgment).
<P>

12	It was submitted on behalf of Dr Burt that it was unreasonable for the
plaintiff to sue Australis on the basis that Dr Burt was
relevantly authorised
and that the unreasonableness of so doing negated a causal connection between
Dr Burt's breach of warranty
of authority (as found) and the plaintiff
incurring the costs of suing Australis.  The asserted unreasonableness was said
to arise
from the consideration that both Dr Burt and Australis, in their
respective defences, denied that Dr Burt was authorised to make
a contract in
the terms asserted by the plaintiff.  I reject this submission.  The denial did
not make it unreasonable for the plaintiff
to sue Australis in view of Dr
Burt's conduct (as found) in representing that he had the relevant
authority.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>Judgment for nominal damages against Dr Burt or judgment for Dr Burt?</b>
<P>

13	In support of Dr Burt's submission that judgment should then be entered in
his favour rather than for nominal damages in favour
of the  plaintiff,
reliance is placed on the Court of Appeal's decision in <i>Boulas v
Angelopoulos</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%205%20BPR%2011%2c477" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 5 BPR 11,477.</a>  In that case, an auctioneer had knocked
a property down to the appellant  However, there was a misunderstanding between
the auctioneer
and the vendor.  The auctioneer thought that the property was on
the market as a result of a conversation with the vendor, whereas
the vendor
had not so intended by what was said in the conversation with the auctioneer.
When the mistake became apparent the vendor
refused to sign the contract for
sale.  The appellant sued the auctioneer and the vendor.  
<P>

14	As against the vendor, it was held that there was neither actual nor
ostensible authority in the auctioneer to make a contract
on behalf of the
vendor to sell at less than the original reserve price.  As against the
auctioneer, it was held that the auctioneer
had warranted that he had authority
to sell at the lower price.  However, the court went on to hold that there was
no loss giving
rise to an entitlement to damages because the contract which
would have come into existence but for the lack of authority on the
part of the
auctioneer would not have been enforceable.  That was because the contract
which would have arisen would have been for
the sale of land and there was no
memorandum in writing as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s54a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act
1919</a></i>.
<P>

15	So far as is presently relevant, a question then arose in that case as to
what order or orders should be made in relation to
the appellant's claim
against the auctioneer.  The appellant had established breach of warranty of
authority but had failed to establish
an entitlement to compensatory damages.
Kirby P said (at 11,491)-
<P>

	"In <i>Lee v Irons</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1958/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1958] VicRp 71</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%20VR%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] VR 436</a>, Pape J at 447-8 held that, inasmuch as
the action for breach of warranty of authority is contractual, the plaintiff
was entitled
to at least nominal so as to vindicate his contractual rights.
There appears to be no English authority in which an award of nominal
damages
has been made.   Mocatta J in <i>V/O Rasnoimport  v  Guthrie &amp; Co Ltd</i>
[1966] 1 Lloyd's Rep 1 at 13, treated the matter as arguable, although only of
academic interest in most cases.  In Canada, it appears
that where the primary
contract was unenforceable, no damages will be awarded.   See discussion by
Leigh, "Breach of Warranty of
Authority", in Fridman (ed), Studies in Canadian
Business Law, 1971, pp364-5.   As the weight of authority appears to be against
the award of nominal damages, I would not be inclined to make such an order in
this case.  It was certainly not the victory the appellant
sought to
attain."
<P>

Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA were in agreement.
<P>

16	The above statement by Kirby P is in general terms.   It is to the effect
that a judgment for nominal damages should not be entered
in favour of a
plaintiff who has established a breach of warranty of authority but not an
entitlement to compensatory damages.  The
passage cannot be received as being
applicable only to cases of breach of warranty of authority where the principal
contract would
have been worthless due to its being unenforceable.  Such a
restrictive reading of the passage is not open, first, because the passage
is
in terms which relate to cases of breach of warranty of authority generally
without any such qualification and, secondly, because
no sensible distinction
can be drawn between a case where the principal contract would have been
valueless due to the contract not
being enforceable and a case where the
principal contract would have been valueless for other reasons.  
<P>

17	In the present case, the plaintiff failed to establish that the principal
contract would have been of any value to him.  <i>Boulas</i> applies.  I am
bound by that decision.  Accordingly, I hold that the plaintiff is not entitled
to nominal damages against Dr Burt,
and that Dr Burt is entitled to judgment
against the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Orders for costs</b>
<P>

18	The starting point in relation to orders for costs is that there will be
judgment for each defendant against the plaintiff. 
The ordinary rule is that
costs follow the event.  Prima facie the defendants are each entitled to an
order for costs against the
plaintiff.  No reason is shown why the ordinary
rule should not apply.
<P>

<b>The claim for costs on an indemnity basis</b>
<P>

19	On Friday 25 October 1996, the hearing had commenced.  A number of
applications by the plaintiff for amendment had been made
and refused.  On that
date, the solicitors for the respective defendants wrote a "Calderbank" letter
to the solicitors for the plaintiff.
 Each letter was marked "Without prejudice
save as to costs".  The letters were in materially identical terms.  They
conveyed an
offer to settle the proceedings on the basis of judgment for the
defendants, each party to pay its own costs, the offer to remain
open until
12.00 noon on Monday 28 October 1996.  Mr Hadid was the first witness called in
the proceedings.  His evidence commenced
on Tuesday 29 October 1996.
<P>

20	The defendants submit that they are entitled to indemnity costs in respect
of the trial as from noon on Monday 28 October 1996.
 The claim for indemnity
costs is not put on any basis other than the "Calderbank" letters.  
<P>

21	In <i>Multicon Engineering Pty Limited v Federal Airports Corporation</i>
(1996) 138 ALR 425, Rolfe J gave a carefully considered judgment on a claim for
indemnity costs based on a "Calderbank" letter. 
His Honour reviewed the
relevant authorities at some length.  In the course of doing so and after doing
so, his Honour made several
statements of principle.  They are much to the same
effect.  At 445:  
<P>

	"Thus there is a strong and consistent body of authority in this court
favouring the predisposition towards an order for indemnity
costs if an offer
of settlement has been made, rejected and not bettered in the litigation.  It
provides, at least, the prima facie
position and, thereafter, one considers all
the facts of the case to decide whether, in the proper exercise of discretion,
that prima
facie view should prevail."
<P>

At 446:
<P>

	"(I)n my opinion, the evidence of a Calderbank letter, the rejection of the
offer contained therein and the failure to obtain a
result better than the
offer, places the offeror in the position that a court should approach an
application by that party for indemnity
costs with a predisposition to holding
that it is entitled to indemnity costs."
<P>

At 448:
<P>

	"(W)hat must be understood is that if that litigant has received an offer
which it does not ultimately better, its desire for a
judicial determination
should, generally speaking, be made subject to its paying the other party's
costs on an indemnity basis from
the date the offer is made."
<P>

At 451:
<P>

	"In my opinion the proper approach to take to an offer of compromise, whether
made under the Rules or pursuant to a Calderbank
letter, is that there should
be a prima facie presumption in the event of the offer not being accepted and
in the event of the recipient
of the offer not receiving a result more
favourable than the offer, that the party rejecting the offer should pay the
costs of the
other party on an indemnity basis from the date of the making of
the offer."
<P>

At 452:
<P>

	"(T)he prima facie position having been established the court must be
satisfied that an order for indemnity costs is not appropriate.
 As I have
indicated, if that is not done there is a failure to exercise the judicial
discretion."
<P>

22	I respectfully adopt these statements of principle in the light of the
authorities reviewed in the judgment, and for the reasons
given in the judgment
with which I find myself in full agreement.  
<P>

23	Prima facie the defendants are entitled to costs on an indemnity basis as
from noon on 28 October 1996.  No cogent consideration
has been advanced
against making such an order in the exercise of the court's discretion.
<P>

24	On behalf of the plaintiff, it was submitted that it was unreasonable of the
defendants to expect that, at the stage which the
trial had reached, the
plaintiff would be in a position to evaluate and take instructions on the
offers of compromise at such short
notice.  There was no evidence as to when
the letters were received by the plaintiff's solicitors.  It cannot have been
earlier than
the morning of Friday 25 October.  The deadline was noon on Monday
28 October.  Effectively, the plaintiff's solicitors had only
the weekend in
which to evaluate the offers and take instructions.  In submissions, the
plaintiff relied on the stage which the trial
had reached as leading to a
conclusion that it was unreasonable to expect a response within the time
specified in the circumstances.
<P>

25	I do not think the plaintiff has made good that submission.  I would have
thought that, before trial, the plaintiff's legal advisers
would have evaluated
the plaintiff's prospects in the proceedings and would have advised the
plaintiff accordingly.  I would also
have thought that the evaluation would be
updated in the light of important developments in the trial - such as the
refusal of applications
to amend - and that the plaintiff would have been
advised accordingly.  I would not expect, in these circumstances, that it would
have been impracticable to evaluate the offers of compromise and to obtain the
plaintiff's instructions over the weekend.
<P>

26	It is significant that no evidence was led to establish that there was any
such difficulty.  I do not say that critically.  In
view of what I have said, I
would not expect that any such evidence could have been called.  I mention this
consideration only because
I am entitled to infer - and I do infer - that no
evidence which would have assisted the plaintiff was available.  This fortifies
my view that it was not unreasonable to expect that the offers could be
evaluated and instructions taken on them during the course
of the weekend.
<P>

27	There is in fact a cogent consideration which fortifies the prima facie
entitlement to indemnity costs.  It is this.  The plaintiff
had no case that a
contract with Australis (as against Australis) or the contract it would have
had (as against Dr Burt) had or would
have had a commercial value for the
plaintiff.  Indeed, on the  evidence, as likely as not, the plaintiff would
have suffered a loss
had such a contract come into existence and gone into
effect.  The fact that the plaintiff's claim was without merit in this sense
is
a strong reason in favour of implementing the prima facie entitlement to
indemnity costs in the exercise of the court's discretion.
<P>

28	For these reasons, the plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs of the
proceedings on a party and party basis to noon on Monday
28 October 1996 and
thereafter on an indemnity basis.
<P>

29	In principle, the costs of the application for an order that the costs of
the trial be allowed on an indemnity basis should not
themselves be payable on
an indemnity basis.  However, time occupied in relation to that application, as
distinct from other matters
argued on 14 and 15 December 1998, was not
significant enough to warrant separate treatment.  
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

The appropriate orders to embody these determinations are as follows:
<P>

1	(1)	Direct the entry of judgment in favour of each defendant against the
plaintiffs.
<P>

(2)	Order the plaintiffs to pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings on a
party and party basis until noon on 28 October 1996
and thereafter on an
indemnity basis.
