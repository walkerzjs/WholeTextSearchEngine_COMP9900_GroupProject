<b>55045/1997 - LAVENDER VIEW REGENCY PTY LIMITED   v   NORTH SYDNEY
COUNCIL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	Milsons Point is one of several suburbs in the Municipality
of North Sydney on the northern foreshores of Sydney Harbour adjacent
to the
Sydney Harbour Bridge, and hence close to the Central Business District of
Sydney via that Bridge.  During the last fifteen
years or so it has been the
subject of considerable commercial and residential property development, and it
is regarded by many as
a desirable area in which to live.
<P>

2   	The defendant, North Sydney Council, ("the Council"), for
which Mr B.W. Walker of Senior Counsel, Mr B.J. Preston of Counsel
and Mr I.R.
Pike of Counsel appeared, is the authority primarily responsible for
considering and either granting or refusing development
and building
applications within the Municipality pursuant to the provisions of the 
<P>

<b>Environmental and Planning Assessment Act</b> 1979, ("the Act"), the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a></b> and various other Acts, statutory codes and
planning schemes.  Applications to the Council to exercise these powers, and
the manner
in which the Council does so, create, in many cases, intense
interest from local residents and a conflict of views between them and
developers as to the extent to which further development should be allowed and
the form of it.  The resolution of such conflicts
is a matter, in the first
instance, for the elected councillors, who may properly have regard to what
they perceive to be appropriate
local considerations, as well as professional
and planning advice, in reaching their conclusions.  Their decisions, which
become
the Council's, can be, in most cases, the subject of appeal to the Land
and Environment Court, ("the Court").  Relevantly for present
purposes there
are Class I appeals, which are concerned, generally speaking, with the
Council's decisions on the merits of such applications,
and Class IV appeals,
which cover, once again speaking generally, questions as to the legal validity
of such decisions.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff, Lavender View Regency Pty Limited, for which
Mr M.H. Tobias of Queen's Counsel, Mr R.C. McDougall of Queen's
Counsel and Mr
T.J. Davie of Counsel appeared, began, under its former name, to acquire
adjacent properties with frontages to Glen
and Cliff Streets, Milsons Point,
the whole area acquired being known as 26 - 30 Glen Street, Milsons Point.
There was erected, on
part of the land, a building known as the SBS Building.
In 1988 the Council had given approval to a development application, DA1011/88,
for the erection of a sixteen storey building at 28 - 30 Glen Street comprising
fourteen storeys of sixty residential units and two
storeys of
retail/restaurant accommodation.  In 1990 the Council gave approval to a
further development application, DA1268/90, for
the erection of a fourteen
storey residential building at 28 - 30 Glen Street.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff was, at all material times, controlled from a
practical point of view by its managing director, Dr Stanley Quek,
who is
highly experienced in the acquisition and development of real estate, through
various companies, in Australia and elsewhere.
 His aim was to erect a block of
high quality home units on the land to be known as "The Colonnades", with some
retail and other
facilities, and to sell them.  Not unnaturally he wished to
maximise the development so that the plaintiff would enjoy as high a
profit as
possible.  This led to tension between the plaintiff, on the one hand, and some
local residents and councillors, on the
other, because, in an attempt to
achieve this objective, the plaintiff proposed a building the bulk and size of
which caused concern
and led to opposition to the development.
<P>

5   	On 17 February 1994 Dr Quek caused the plaintiff's initial
architects, Bruce Swalwell Architects,  to lodge a development application,
DA1082/94, with the Council.  This development application was referred to in
the proceedings as "DA1" and, after extensive negotiations
and various
amendments to the plans, it was approved by the Council on 8 February 1995
subject to conditions.  The conditions included
that the building was to be
built "strictly" in accordance with the plans submitted with DA1, which could
not be done lawfully because
they did not comply with certain relevant building
requirements, and that an application be made to modify DA1 pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.102</a>
of the Act.  These requirements obliged the plaintiff to make at least two
further applications to the Council before it would have
final approval to
build.  Each application would have required the councillors to exercise their
discretion in granting or refusing
it.
<P>

6   	It was not in issue that the Council, in granting DA1 on
the terms and in the circumstances which it did, acted contrary to
law so that
a challenge to it in Class IV proceedings would, almost inevitably, result in
its being declared invalid and void, subject
to a matter to which I shall now
refer.  Nor was it in issue that on 6 April 1995 the Council caused notice of
its decision to grant
DA1 to be published in purported compliance with s.104A
of the Act; that the notice did not comply with the requirements of that
section; and that if it had DA1 would have been impervious to challenge, in the
sense that the validity of the consent could not
be questioned in any legal
proceedings except those commenced in the Court by any person at any time
before the expiration of three
months from the date on which such public notice
was given.  Further, it was not in issue that the persons, who ultimately
challenged
DA1 successfully, would not have done so within the period of three
months from 6 April 1995, their objections and challenge manifesting
themselves
well after the expiry of that period.
<P>

7   	In October 1995, before the plaintiff submitted its final
building plans and its request for a modification of DA1 pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.102</a>, the
triennial local government elections were held.  They resulted in changes in
the composition of the Council in that a number
of councillors, who ran on a
policy that new development in the Municipality, and particularly in Milsons
Point, was excessive in
size and bulk, were elected.  Thereafter, the plaintiff
was confronted with a Council at least potentially less sympathetic to the
development than its predecessor.
<P>

8   	On 24 November 1995 the solicitors for various objectors
gave notice of their intention to challenge the validity of DA1 and,
on 1
February 1996, they commenced Class IV proceedings in relation to it.  This
application could not have been pursued if the notice
published by the Council,
in purported compliance with s.104A, had been valid.
<P>

9   	In due course the Court held DA1 to be invalid and void.
It was not in issue that any modification of DA1 pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.102</a> would have
fallen with that finding, because the modification could have no greater
validity than the development application on
which it was founded; nor that the
plaintiff understood that from the time the challenge was mooted.  In these
circumstances the
plaintiff lost the benefit of DA1, a result it had understood
was probable at least from the commencement of the Class IV proceedings.
 It
had, therefore, after becoming aware of the challenge, undertaken various other
steps to obtain a development approval and, ultimately,
on 15 June 1998, the
Council resolved to determine DA74/98 by consenting to it.  This development
application was referred to in
the proceedings as "DA4".  Between DA1 and DA4
there were two further development applications, which were referred to in the
proceedings
as "DA2" and "DA3". DA4 provided for a smaller development than
that proposed in DA1, DA2 and DA3 and, accordingly, the plaintiff
will have
less units to sell than it potentially would have had but for the invalidity of
DA1.  I say "potentially" because the plaintiff
was not assured that the
further consents necessary to develop conformably with DA1 would be granted.
The building work has now commenced,
although it is not anticipated that it
will be finished until late 2000.
<P>

<b>The Proceedings</b>
<P>

10   	By a Summons issued on 25 September 1997 the plaintiff
sued the Council seeking to recover damages in respect of the allegedly
negligent failure by it to consider and properly grant DA1, and to advertise
the granting of consent to it in a proper manner.  
On 19 June 1998, Hunter J
made an order, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2</a>, that at the hearing, which was
scheduled to commence on 29 July 1998, the issues of liability pleaded in
paragraphs 1 to 25 of the
Amended Points of Claim, and certain liability issues
in a proposed Amended Cross-Claim, be heard prior to the remaining issues.
 In
essence this meant that the issues of liability were to be determined prior to
those of damages.  The proceedings commenced before
me on 29 July 1998 and, on
31 July 1998, the plaintiff was granted leave to file a Second Further Amended
Points of Claim to which
the Council filed a Defence on the same day.  On 3
August 1998 the parties resolved the issues of liability, the cross-claims
being
disposed of in circumstances which mean that it is unnecessary to
consider them further.
<P>

11   	The parties brought in Short Minutes of Order to give
effect to their agreements and, as between the plaintiff and the Council,
the
following are the relevant orders:-
<P>

<b>"3.	Direct entry of judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for
damages to be assessed in respect only of the cause of action
concerning the
defendant's negligent failure to give a proper and effective public notice
pursuant to s.104A of the Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act of its
consent to DA1082/94.</b>
<P>

<b>  ..........</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	Order that there be an inquiry into the amount of damages which the
plaintiff has sustained by reason that, but for the defendant's
negligent
failure to give a proper and effective public notice pursuant to s.104A of the
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
of its consent to DA1082/94, the
plaintiff would have had a consent, in the terms of Annexure `A' hereto, which
consent would have
become effective and would have operated from 8 February
1995 and which could have been relied upon by the plaintiff without risk
of any
legal challenge thereto."</b>
<P>

12   	The issue for decision now is the amount of damages to
which the plaintiff is entitled in consequence of the Council's negligent
failure to give a proper and effective notice pursuant to s.104A.  Several
matters in relation to that can be noted immediately.
 Although the plaintiff
made a claim for damages for loss of opportunity, that was not pressed at the
hearing, save in a very limited
way to which I shall refer.  Secondly, although
the Council pleaded failure by the plaintiff to take all reasonable steps to
mitigate
its loss and contributory negligence on the plaintiff's part, neither
of these allegations was pursued.  The Council's failure to
press the assertion
that the plaintiff did not take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss did not
proceed on the basis that there
was loss caused by the Council, but rather on
the basis that the plaintiff did what it would have done, irrespective of
whether the
Council had been negligent, so that the particular circumstances
did not give rise to a claim of failure to mitigate.  Thirdly, the
various
experts retained by the parties conferred and reached a substantial measure of
agreement on amounts which, if appropriate
as a matter of law, should be
included in the assessment of damages.  This, if I may say so with respect, was
an eminently sensible
approach and greatly reduced the hearing time.
<P>

<b>The Issues</b>
<P>

13   	The plaintiff's claim is based on the hypothesis that if
the Council had not been negligent in relation to the giving of the
notice
under s.104A, it would, at all times, have had a valid development approval in
the terms of DA1, upon which it could have
relied without risk of legal
challenge.  On that hypothesis the plaintiff has submitted that the development
would have continued
on the basis of DA1as modified by a second s.102
application, which was referred to in the proceedings as "102(2)", rather than
the
first such application, which was referred to as "102(1)", and that this
would have avoided any significant diminution in or interruption
to the
development.  The submission continued:-
<P>

<b>"This assumes that 102(2) would have been submitted in about March 1996 and
approved by Council relatively shortly thereafter."</b>
<P>

14   	The plaintiff's alternative position was that development
would have continued based on DA1, as modified by 102(2), but with
an
interruption so that building work did not re-commence until 1 June 1997.  This
submission assumed that 102(2) would have been
lodged on 21 October 1996, (as
it was), and would have been determined by approval of the Council, as the
plaintiff submits it would
have been, by December 1996.  However, the
submission also accommodated another alternative, namely that 102(2) would have
been determined
in December 1996 by the Council by refusal, but that it would
have been approved by the Court after an expedited hearing.  The submission
was
that the appeal would have been heard and determined by an Assessor or the
Court in February or March 1997, a decision would
have been given in April
1997, and an amended building approval would have been granted approximately a
month later, so that construction
would have re-commenced no later than 1 May
1997, although the plaintiff accepted that on these hypotheses construction
would have
commenced on 1 June 1997.  (These positions are set forth, inter
alia, in paragraphs 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 of the plaintiff's written submissions
on
damages furnished on 15 March 1999.)
<P>

15   	The plaintiff pointed to the fact that it had entered into
a building contract with Multiplex Constructions Pty Limited, ("Multiplex"),
on
12 January 1996 for the carrying out of the building work, and that once
approval in the form of DA1 was granted it commenced
a marketing campaign,
which enjoyed a good measure of success, by selling units off-the-plan,
although such sales were subject to
the building being completed basically in
accordance with the plans.  The plaintiff submitted that it was inconceivable
that it would
take any steps which would place these contracts in jeopardy.
<P>

16   	The Council's principal submission was that even if it had
not been negligent in the manner it conceded for the purpose of
these
proceedings, the plaintiff would have acted in essentially the same way as it
did, viz it would have pursued developmental
approval in various forms to
maximise the development, although not through the vehicle of DA1 because that
did not provide for the
building it wanted to construct, and it would have done
so until forced by the failure to gain approval to a development of that
size
to submit when it did, on 19 February 1998, DA4.  It was submitted that
irrespective of the legal challenge to DA1, the plaintiff
would have lodged DA2
when it did, and that the Council would have rejected it, as it did, and that
the plaintiff's appeal to the
Court would have been unsuccessful, as it was.
Thereafter, it was submitted, the plaintiff would have submitted DA3, which the
Council
would have rejected, as it did, and the plaintiff's appeal to the Court
would have been unsuccessful, as it was.  The submission
of DA4 and its
approval would have taken place when it in fact did, so that the Council's
negligence did not alter the course of
events, which would have happened
irrespective of its negligence.
<P>

17   	The fundamental premises underpinning these submissions
were that the terms of DA1 necessarily left the plaintiff in the Council's
hands as to the approval of the building application and the modification to
DA1 pursuant to s.102; that by the time the plaintiff
made these applications
it was dealing with councillors different from those who had approved DA1; that
subsequent actions on the
part of the Council made clear that it would not have
approved what the plaintiff was seeking, which step the Council was entitled
to
take consistently with the proper exercise of its functions, and that the
plaintiff had not established that the Court would have
reversed the Council's
decisions;  that the plaintiff would have continued to press for as large a
development as it could achieve
until forced to submit DA4; and that in
consequence the building would not have proceeded earlier than it has, so that
the plaintiff
cannot establish that it has suffered much of the damage for
which it now claims.
<P>

18   	The Council submitted that the proper findings to make are
that:-
<P>

(a)	the plaintiff did not wish to pursue DA1 as the development vehicle;
<P>

(b)	the plaintiff intended, irrespective of the legal validity of DA1, to lodge
DA2 when it did;
<P>

(c)	even if the plaintiff had pursued DA1 the first s.102 application,
(102(1)), would have failed, which was conceded;
<P>

(d)	102(2) would not have been lodged until it was on 21 October 1996;
<P>

(e)	102(2) would not have been approved by the Council whether it was lodged in
March/April 1996 or on 21 October 1996;
<P>

(f)	the Court would not have granted approval to 102(2) on appeal whenever it
was lodged; and
<P>

(g)	accordingly, the plaintiff would have been remitted to a development
conformably with DA4, which would not have been lodged
and approved until it in
fact was, with the consequence that the Council's negligence has not been
causative of any substantial loss
to the plaintiff.
<P>

19   	In the plaintiff's written submissions of 15 March 1999,
the Council's primary position was stated as being that there would
have been
no development in accordance with DA1 and 102(2), and that the only development
which would have been carried out is that
permitted by DA4.  The plaintiff
accepts that if that be found to be correct it has not suffered any loss of
profits for which the
Council is liable.  In its written submissions on damages
the plaintiff, after setting forth its primary and alternative positions,
stated two other "scenarios".  The first was that to which I have just
referred. The second was that under the Council's alternative
position, which
involved that the development would have been carried out under DA1 and 102(2),
the recommencement of building works
would have been delayed until 1 December
1997 by reason of the appeal against the refusal of 102(2) not being expedited,
but ultimately
being successful.  This requires a different calculation of
damages.  I should make it clear that the Council did not concede for
a moment
the factual basis of the plaintiff's success on appeal.  This position was very
much a fall-back one.
<P>

20   	Thus the issue for determination was whether the Council's
negligence in failing to advertise properly the consent to DA1
was causative of
the loss the plaintiff alleges it has suffered.  There are two important
issues, at least, relevant to this.  The
first is that the plaintiff must
establish that but for the negligence it would have pursued DA1 through 102(2).
It was not suggested
that DA1 did not have to be pursued through an application
under s.102, and the evidence was that after 102(1) was abandoned the
vehicle
used was 102(2).  The second is that if it had, either the Council would have
approved the modification pursuant to 102(2)
if 102(2) had been lodged in
March/April 1996, or, alternatively that it would have approved 102(2) as
lodged on 21 October 1996,
which it did not, and, in that event, the Court, on
appeal, would have.  The Court was not required to consider this issue because
it held that DA1 was void, thus denying 102(2) any effect.  Mr Tobias submitted
that in determining what the Court "would have done"
it was not for me to seek
to place myself in the Court's position and decide what I would have done as
the Court, but rather it was
for me to determine what, on the balance of
probabilities, I consider the Court would have done if it had heard the appeal
from the
Council's refusal of 102(2).
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

21   	The plaintiff's case is one whereby it seeks to recover
damages for the defendant's admitted negligence.  Prima facie the
damages are
to be assessed by reference to the financial loss the plaintiff suffered in
consequence of that negligence, i.e. the
amount of its loss because DA1 was
able to be declared invalid and void by reason of the specified negligence.
Therefore, it is necessary
to compare what would have happened if DA1 had not
suffered that fate, ("the hypothetical case"), and what did happen, ("the
actual
case"), to see the extent to which the plaintiff suffered loss.
<P>

22   	Armed with DA1, the plaintiff had a vehicle through which
it alleges it could have developed the land in a manner which would
have
produced for it an asserted financial benefit.  Deprived of DA1, the plaintiff
submitted that it was forced to seek other approval
for the development, which
ultimately resulted in DA4, which gave it an asserted inferior financial
result.  The plaintiff contends
that the essential measure of its loss is the
difference between the two amounts.  There is no novelty in comparing the
hypothetical
and the actual in assessing damages for negligence, it being kept
firmly in mind, of course, that the plaintiff carries the onus
of establishing
the quantum of such loss.  In each case the Court must decide whether the
plaintiff has satisfied it what would have
happened, but for the negligence,
and what did happen in consequence of the negligence.  Both the hypothetical
and the actual may
be in issue.  An injured employee may allege that but for
the employer's negligence he or she would have continued to work until
retirement and gained promotion with the employer with increased remuneration
but, in consequence of the negligence he or she can
no longer engage in gainful
employment and thus has suffered damages by way of loss of earning capacity,
including at the promotion
level.  In such a case both the hypothetical and the
actual may be challenged and, to the extent to which they are and allowing for
the shifting evidentiary onus, the plaintiff carries the ultimate onus of
proving the loss for which he or she contends.
<P>

23   	The matters to which I have just referred are trite law.
But the plaintiff submitted that:-
<P>

<b>"Obviously, there are always difficulties in trying to determine the
probabilities of a party's conduct in what is a hypothetical
situation: in such
circumstances it is appropriate that doubts arising as a consequence of such a
situation brought about by the
defendant's admitted wrongdoing should be
resolved against the defendant: cf <i>Houghton v Immer (No 155) Pty Limited</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2044%20NSWLR%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 44 NSWLR 46</a> at 59C-E."</b>
<P>

Prima facie, this submission does not accord with the fundamental proposition
that the onus is on the plaintiff, whether the tortious
wrongdoing is admitted
or found after a contest, to prove the amount of damages.  <b>Houghton</b> was
not a case concerned with tortious liability, but with equitable compensation
in consequence of a fraud on the minority, which
rendered a special resolution
voidable in equity.  At first instance it was held that because of what had
transpired it was too late
to grant the relief the plaintiff claimed and that,
in lieu thereof, the plaintiff was entitled to equitable compensation. 
<P>

24   	At p.56 Handley JA, with whom Mason P and Beazley JA
agreed, said that equitable compensation is intended to compensate for
loss
caused by conduct which equity holds to be fraudulent.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Since the defendants are not in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff
and have not committed a tort, they are not accountable
for profits derived
from the project ...   The award should compensate the plaintiff but it is no
part of its function to strip profits
from the defendants, or to punish them
for wrongdoing."</b>
<P>

His Honour said that compensation had to be balanced to avoid over-compensation
to the plaintiff and the penalising of the defendants.
 He referred to the
valuation evidence, much of which he considered irrelevant in the light of his
earlier analysis.  His Honour
was of the view that the Court was not concerned,
inter alia, with an analysis of a hypothetical development.  He then considered
the trial Judge's findings on compensation, which he did not consider could be
upheld, and proceeded to the question whether the
Court of Appeal could assess
it.  Whilst he acknowledged that the accounting issue would normally be
referred to a Master, he was
of the view that in that case that should only be
done as a last resort and if no other course was fairly open and, at p.59,
continued:-
<P>

<b>"The defendants, having improved common property without lawful authority,
and attempted to effect a fraud on the minority, are wrongdoers,
and their
failure to keep and produce proper accounts of the actual expenditure on the
common property has made it difficult to assess
the compensation due to the
plaintiff: compare <i>Armory v Delamirie</i> [1722] 1 Stra 505; <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1722/J94.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1722] EWHC KB J94</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=93%20ER%20664" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">93 ER 664.</a>  In
my judgment the Court should assess the compensation in a robust manner,
relying on the presumption against wrongdoers, the onus
of proof, and resolving
doubtful questions against the party `whose actions have made an accurate
determination so problematic':
see <i>LJP Investments Pty Limited v Howard Chia
Investments Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2024%20NSWLR%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 24 NSWLR 499</a> at 508."</b>
<P>

25   	His Honour's reference to <b>Armory v Delamirie</b> shows
how different that case was from the present.  There the chimney sweep sued a
jeweller for damages for conversion of a jewel
he had found in a chimney.  As
the jeweller, in whose possession the jewel was, refused to produce it so that
it could be valued
the Court held that the amount of damages was to be presumed
against him to be the greatest value that a jewel of that type could
have.
Clearly the plaintiff's claim could not be frustrated by the wrongdoer's
conduct, as may have happened in <b>Houghton</b>.  Similarly in <b>Howard
Chia</b>, Hodgson J considered that the defendant's wrongful act and the
absence of any decision maker from the witness box made a decision
on what
course the defendant would have taken "highly problematical", thus justifying
the <b>Armory v Delamirie</b> approach "and resolving the question of value
against the party whose actions have made an accurate determination so
problematic".
<P>

26   	Mr Walker submitted that there is no evidence in the
present case that any conduct on the Council's part has made an accurate
determination of the damages "problematic" or "so problematic", nor caused the
plaintiff difficulty in quantifying the damages. 
All the material from which
damages can be assessed is in the possession of the plaintiff or available to
it.  It has formulated
its claim on a number of hypotheses it has sought to
establish.  It is not suggested the Council could have produced any material,
which would have assisted the plaintiff in this assessment, and that it has
refused to do so.
<P>

27   	The case is, therefore, one where this Court must, in my
opinion, assess damages for negligence in conformity with the basic
principles
to which I referred initially.
<P>

<b>Causation</b>
<P>

28   	Both parties relied on the recent decision of the High
Court in <b>Chappel v Hart</b> (1998) 72 ALJR 1344.  At paragraph 34(6) McHugh
J repeated the accepted formulation in this area that, subject to the shifting
onus
at trial, the onus was on the plaintiff to prove the damages suffered in
consequence of tortious conduct.  In footnote 33, after
stating that the
subjective theory of causation was applicable, his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"In determining the reliability of the plaintiff's evidence in jurisdictions
where the subjective test operates, therefore, demeanour
can play little part
in accepting the plaintiff's evidence.  It may be a ground for rejecting the
plaintiff's evidence.  But given
that most plaintiffs will genuinely believe
that they would have taken another option, if presented to them, the
reliability of their
evidence can only be determined by reference to objective
factors, particularly the attitude and conduct of the plaintiff at or about
the
time when the breach of duty occurred."</b>
<P>

Mr Walker relied on this footnote in support of the submission that the Court
must, in assessing the evidence, have regard to the
objective facts in
determining the subjective intent.  Mr Tobias relied on the passage from the
judgment of Kirby J in sub-paragraph
(8) at p.1367, where his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a breach of duty has occurred which is
closely followed by damage, a prima facie causal connection
will have been
established.  It is then for the defendant, by evidence and argument, to
establish that the patient should <u>not</u> recover damages": His Honour's
emphasis.</b>
<P>

This was said in the context of the shifting onus of proof.  I do not
understand his Honour to be saying that the onus, in the end,
does not rest on
the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>The Hypothetical Case</b>
<P>

29   	The plaintiff contended for the various hypotheses, which
were expressly adopted as disclosing what might have happened, but
for the
negligence, and to which I have referred. 
<P>

Mr Walker submitted that one cannot have alternative factual situations, which
will give rise to alternative results for the purpose
of assessing damages, but
that the Court must find the facts as established by the plaintiff's evidence
and, on the basis of that
finding, consider any possible alternatives flowing
from what the plaintiff has proved.  The submission was that the proved facts
may give rise to alternative results, but that it is not permissible to conduct
a case on the footing that there may be alternative,
but conflicting, basic
facts.  Therefore, he submitted, it was not permissible to run a case on the
basis that 102(2) would have
been lodged in March 1996 but, if that was not
accepted, then it would have been lodged in October 1996.   In my opinion, the
onus
is on the plaintiff to establish, on the balance of probabilities, what it
would have done in the hypothetical case.  A case based
on apparently
conflicting and contradictory factual premises may make it difficult for the
plaintiff to establish what it would have
done.  If the plaintiff fails at that
level there may be no sufficient factual basis on which to determine
damages.
<P>

30   	In the absolute terms in which Mr Walker put the
submission, I do not accept it. One may well have a case where the plaintiff
asserts that but for the negligence he or she would have done various things,
which could be said to be alternatives e.g. an employee
may say that had he or
she been able to continue to engage in gainful employment he or she would have
received promotion as an employee
of the negligent employer, but if that had
not happened he or she would have moved on to another employer in a higher
position, which
would have given an income commensurate with that on promotion.
However, Mr Walker's submissions, notwithstanding their initial generality,
were directed to the facts of this case.  In my opinion, the Court must decide
what the plaintiff has established, on the facts of
this case and the onus
being on it, it would have done, but for the negligence.  The two positions put
forward by the plaintiff as
to what it would have done are inherently
inconsistent. The first is that it would have lodged 102(2) in about March 1996
and the
Council would have approved it.  The second is that it would have
lodged it in October 1996 and either the Council would have approved
it or, if
it did not, the Court on appeal would have. It is necessary to decide whether
it would have followed one path or the other
and, if it did, what would have
happened. The plaintiff then sought to erect a case that in March 1996 it would
have lodged DA2 and
102(2) in the hypothetical situation, and thus had the best
of both worlds.  Mr Tobias, in his written submissions of 12 March 1999
(paragraph 14), conceded that there was no "direct evidence" that this
two-pronged attack would have been followed.  That was not
one of the
hypotheses put forward for the assessment of damages and, in my opinion, it
tends to confuse the situation because the
hypothetical case proceeds on the
assumption that there was no reason not to lodge an application under s.102
because, on the hypothetical
case, there was no danger that the foundation for
such an application, viz DA1, would have been struck down.  Therefore, the
inference
is that if DA2 would have been lodged in any event, for which there
was a sufficiently strong evidentiary base to satisfy me that
that would have
happened, there was no point in lodging 102(2) at that time, because DA2
represented, I am satisfied, the building
the plaintiff wanted.  It is
intellectually very difficult to find that the plaintiff would have pursued its
first stated course,
viz to have lodged 102(2) in March 1996, and,
notwithstanding that it would have, that it would have followed the second, viz
to
have lodged 102(2) in October 1996.  If it had pursued the first
successfully, there would have been no need to pursue the second.
 If the first
proved unsuccessful there would have been no real point in following the second
because the consequences could hardly
have been expected to be different having
regard to the similarity of that proposed in 102(2) and DA2.  Thus the
plaintiff has difficulty
in asserting that, as a matter of fact, it would have
followed the first course, but, if that is rejected, I should find that it
would have followed the second, when the two are at odds.  As I have sought to
say the formulation of the case based on differing
and inconsistent hypotheses,
and based on at least one factual premise which did not find itself into the
case for damages, creates
problems for finding that the plaintiff would have
pursued any particular course.  It does not mean that the plaintiff cannot
establish
a case.  It makes it more difficult for it to discharge the onus and
thus do so.
<P>

<b>The Development Approval: DA1</b>
<P>

31   	DA1 stated that it was not an approval to erect a building
under Chapter 7 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a></b> 1993; that such an approval
was required prior to the commencement of any work on site; that any variation
to DA1 could only be made
with the written approval of the Council; and that
major variations would require a new or amended development application.  The
first condition provided:-
<P>

<b>"Development is to be carried out strictly in accordance with Plan Numbers
A100A-A124A as amended, dated 22/12/94, drawn by Bruce
Swalwell Architects, and
received by Council on 23/12/94, except as varied by the conditions listed
hereunder.  Any minor modification
to the approved Plans will require the
lodgment, and consideration by Council of a separate application pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 102</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a>.
Modifications will require the lodgment of a new Development
Application."</b>
<P>

32   	The second condition stated that:-
<P>

<b>"A formal Building Application accompanied by plans and specifications SHALL
BE submitted in accordance with the Building Code of
Australia, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local
Government Act, 1993</a> and the specific conditions of this consent."</b>
<P>

The Building Code of Australia is referred to in certain of the documents as
"the BCA" and I shall refer to it as such.
<P>

33   	On 8 May 1995 Building Application 95/275 was submitted to
the Council and, on 30 May 1995, it approved the request to demolish
the SBS
building.  Subsequently it approved bulk excavation on the site.
<P>

34   	On 6 August 1995, the plaintiff commenced its off-the-plan
marketing programme and, on 9 November 1995, Multiplex commenced
construction
work although, at that stage, it had not entered into a formal contract with
the plaintiff.  On 10 November 1995 the
Council determined BA95/275 by
consenting to it subject to a number of conditions and on certain bases.  The
approval noted that
it was for a proposed multi-storey residential flat
building containing 170 units with retail shops at street level and underground
parking.  Condition 117, which is of  importance in the proceedings,
provided:-
<P>

<b>"The submitted building application plans do not entirely mirror the
approval Development Consent plans in a number of respects. 
In particular the
terraces at Levels 15, 16 and 19 are not stepped back the equivalent distances
as approved in the consent plans.
 A Section 102 application is to be submitted
which outline <u>all</u> the changes between the Building Application and the
Development Consent plans prior to any excavation taking place.</b>
<P>

<b>(<u>Reason</u>: Construct in accordance with approved consent.)"  (The
Council's emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This condition, in essence, reflected the requirement that development was to
be carried out "strictly in accordance with" the designated
plans.  More
significantly, it called for an application pursuant to s.102 of the Act.
<P>

35   	Section 102, in so far as it is relevant, provides:-
<P>

<b>"(1)	Upon application being made in the prescribed form by the applicant or
any other person entitled to act upon the consent, a consent
authority which
has granted development consent under this Division may modify the consent
where:</b>
<P>

<b> (a)	it is satisfied that the development to which the consent as modified
relates is substantially the same development,</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	it is satisfied that no prejudice will be caused to any person who
objected to the development application the subject of that
consent, </b>
<P>

<b>.....</b>
<P>

<b>(3A)	In determining an application for modification of a consent under this
section, the consent authority must take into consideration
such of the matters
referred to in section 90 as are of relevance to the development the subject of
the application."</b>
<P>

Sub-sections (1)(a) and (b) contain provisions described as "the threshold
provisions" over which an applicant must step, by satisfying
the Council or the
Court, for the purpose of activating s.102. 
<P>

36   	Section 90 required the Council, in determining an
application, to take into consideration a number of matters specified therein,
which were referred to in the proceedings as the "merit" matters or
considerations.
<P>

37   	A matter which attracted attention during the hearing was
that before a modification could be made pursuant to s.102, the
"threshold"
requirements of sub-ss.(1)(a) and (b) had to be achieved.  A further matter,
which was the subject of argument, was the
extent to which the provisions of
sub-s.(3A) applied in requiring the Council to have regard to s.90
considerations.  The question,
according to the plaintiff's submission, was
whether, at all material times, sub-s.(3A) operated to apply s.90
considerations only
to the amendments or modifications put forward in the s.102
application, or whether it operated to allow the Council to consider
s.90
matters generally conformably with the majority decision, on this point, of the
Court of Appeal in <b>North Sydney Council v Michael Standley &amp; Associates
Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/163.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 163</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20468" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 468</a>, which judgment was given on 12 May 1998.
The purpose of engaging in this exercise was not to submit what the proper
interpretation
of sub-s.(3A) was, but how the Court would have applied the
sub-section, having regard to a number of its own decisions prior to
the Court
of Appeal's decision.  The Council submitted that I should assume that the
Court would have applied the sub-section consistently
with the law and,
therefore, in accordance with the Court of Appeal's later decision.
Alternatively, it submitted that the plaintiff's
interpretation of the Court's
decisions was too narrow, and that the Court had held that one considered s.90
matters not only as
they related directly or solely to the amendments and
modifications, but also in so far as they impacted on the development as a
whole.
<P>

38   	On the other hand, it was not in issue that further
development applications could be lodged, which would be determined in
accordance with the provisions relating to such applications and without it
being necessary for the "threshold" requirements of s.102
to be met, thus
allowing the Council to revisit all s.90 matters.  The reason these
considerations were thought to be of importance
is probably clear.  The
plaintiff wished to assert that DA1 gave it a right to develop, subject to
compliance with the conditions,
and that the vehicle provided by s.102 for the
necessary modifications and amendments raised no s.90 impediments once the two
threshold
issues were satisfied.  Thus a newly constituted Council could not
revisit the s.90 matters on which it may have taken a more stringent
attitude
than its predecessor, which in granting approval to DA1 had found those matters
favourably to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff's
submission was that that would
have been the position under the Court's previous decisions and, on appeal, the
Court, uninstructed
by the Court of Appeal's decision, would have followed
those decisions.  On the other hand the Council put the submissions to which
I
have referred and, based on them, submitted that s.90 considerations would have
been fatal to 102(2) both before the Council and
the Court.
<P>

<b>What Happened Thereafter  </b>
<P>

39   	On 19 December 1995 the plaintiff lodged with the Council
s.102 Application 3326/95, ("102(1)").  It was common ground that
this
application could never have succeeded.  On 12 January 1996 the plaintiff
entered into a building contract with Multiplex and,
on 1 February 1996, the
Class IV proceedings were commenced in the Court to seek to have DA1
invalidated.
<P>

40   	On 17 and 19 February 1996 respectively demolition work
was completed and excavation work commenced and, on 4 April 1996,
DA1163/96,
("DA2"), was lodged.  The plaintiff asserted that this was lodged because of
the challenge in the Court to the validity
of DA1.  Prima facie this submission
has some attraction because, as I have mentioned, it was not in issue that a
modification of
a development application, pursuant to s.102, could only be as
valid as the original application.  Therefore, if the challenge to
the validity
of DA1 was successful, any modifications to it pursuant to s.102 would fall.
It was the plaintiff's primary case that
but for the challenge it would have
lodged 102(2) at about that time, which would have been approved by the
Council, with the consequences
to which I have referred, and that it would not
have lodged DA2 then.  The prima facie attraction lost some of its appeal when
it
is realised that DA2, which made only "minimal" concessions in relation to
the contentious issues of size and bulk, put the plaintiff
squarely back in the
position of having to satisfy the relevant s.90 requirements, in the first
instance to the newly elected councillors.
 This is also highly significant
because there was a very real issue as to whether DA2 would have been lodged,
irrespective of the
Council's negligence, on 4 April 1996.  On either basis,
viz whether 102(2) or DA2 would have been lodged, it was conceded that the
plaintiff would have been dependent, in the first instance, on the Council's
further approval.  Once this is understood there is
no apparent reason why the
pursuit of 102(2) provided the plaintiff with a better position than the
pursuit of DA2, unless it is
correct to say that the Council, in considering
102(2), could only have had regard to limited s.90 matters.  This potentially
difficulty
for the plaintiff is underscored when the similarity between the two
developments, i.e. 102(2) and DA2, particularly in relation
to bulk and size,
is appreciated.  That similarity, it was submitted, makes it difficult to see
how either the Council or the Court
would have come to a different result in
determining each.
<P>

41   	The lodging of DA2 led to an agreement that the hearing of
the Class IV proceedings be vacated, which the Court did on 26
April 1996, and
that they not be re-listed unless the hearing dates obtained were after the
Council had determined DA2, which determination
was not to include any deemed
refusal, or the expiration of six months from the date of any order vacating
the hearing. Plainly it
was contemplated that if DA2 was approved, the
plaintiff would not seek to proceed with DA1.  Prima facie it may be said that
this
was because of the challenge to it.  However, that is not consistent with
the lodging in October 1996 of 102(2), nor with the plaintiff's
evidence that
it did not wish to build in accordance with DA1 in any event.
<P>

42   	On 21 May 1996 a building application was lodged in
relation to DA2, but this was not assessed as the Council determined DA2
by
rejecting it on 26 August 1996.  This was notwithstanding a report from an
independent consultant recommending that it should
be approved.  It will be
necessary to consider what DA2 sought in a little detail.  Suffice to say, for
the moment, that it made
little or no concession by reducing the bulk and size
of the development as proposed in DA1, notwithstanding that the plaintiff had
been advised by a senior planning officer of the Council in February 1996 that
this would have to be done if the s.102 application
was to have any real chance
of success.  It tried to retain as much of DA1, in the sense of the number of
units, as possible.  This
is not a criticism of the plaintiff, which, for
understandable commercial reasons, wished to have as many units available for
sale
as it could achieve.  However, it is very relevant in considering what
steps the plaintiff would have taken.
<P>

43   	On 28 May 1996, the plaintiff appealed against the deemed
determination of DA2 by refusal of consent in consequence of the
Council's
failure to approve or reject it within a specified period.
<P>

44   	On 28 June 1996 the excavation work was completed and
contract works suspended.
<P>

45   	Talbot J heard the plaintiff's appeal against the
rejection of DA2 in early September 1996 and, on 11 September 1996, he refused
consent.  His Honour, essentially, was of the view that the bulk and size of
the proposed development was excessive.
<P>

46   	On 21 October 1996 the plaintiff lodged a s.102
Application 3149/96, which is 102(2), being the application the plaintiff
has
asserted it would have lodged in late March/early April 1996, but for the
asserted invalidity of DA1. On 3 December 1996, the
Class IV proceedings were
re-listed and, on 16 December 1996, the Council determined 102(2) by rejecting
it.  On 18 December 1996,
Mr Andersons of Peddle Thorp &amp; Walker Pty
Limited, ("Peddle Thorp and Walker"), which architect was then retained by the
plaintiff,
submitted DA1651/96, ("DA3"), to the Council.  It will be necessary
to refer to this application in more detail but I note, at this
stage, that it
also attempted to retain as many units as possible and, therefore, made little
change to the bulk and size of the
proposed development, notwithstanding the
advice of Mr Andersons.
<P>

47   	On 4 March 1997 the plaintiff appealed against the deemed
determination of DA3 by rejection and, on 1 April 1997, Council
resolved to
determine DA3 by refusing consent.  The plaintiff also appealed against the
refusal to approve 102(2), and this matter
was listed for hearing before Talbot
J, together with the Class IV proceedings, on 1 April 1997.
<P>

48   	On 15 April 1997 the Council notified Peddle Thorp &amp;
Walker that DA3 had been determined by refusal of consent.  On 21
April 1997,
the site was handed back to the plaintiff by Multiplex and, on 24 April 1997,
the plaintiff terminated the contract with
Multiplex with effect from 30 April
1997, on the basis that it was frustrated.  On 30 April 1997 Talbot J declared
DA1 was granted
contrary to law and was void and, accordingly, there was no
basis upon which the appeal against the refusal of 102(2) could proceed.
 This
latter determination was not in issue.
<P>

49   	In July 1997 the appeal against the refusal to approve DA3
was heard in the Court by Talbot J and, on 20 August 1997, his
Honour
determined the appeal by refusing consent.
<P>

50   	On 25 September 1997 these proceedings were commenced.

<P>

51   	9 January 1998 was the date for practical completion of
the initial contract between the plaintiff and Multiplex dated 12
January 1996,
which had been terminated.
<P>

52   	On 19 February 1998 DA74/98, ("DA4"), was lodged by Peddle
Thorp &amp; Walker and, on 15 June 1998, the Council resolved to
determine it
by consent, issuing its notice of determination on 3 July 1998.  On 2 September
1998, BA98/557 was submitted to the
Council for approval and, on 20 October
1998, marketing commenced by sales, once again, off-the-plan.  On 7 December
1998, the Council
determined BA98/557 by approving it.
<P>

<b>What The Plaintiff Would Have Done But For The Negligence</b>
<P>

53   	What the plaintiff would have done, but for the Council's
negligence, depends essentially on the evidence of Dr Quek.  His
first witness
statement, all of which statements were marked as Exhibit B, was made on 28 May
1998.  He set out his position, duties
and functions with the plaintiff and its
acquisition of the relevant land. In paragraph 3 he referred to another
company, Greencliff
Developments Pty Limited, ("Greencliff"), which became the
manager for the project. This was a company essentially under his management
and control. He described the consolidation of the various pieces of land and,
in paragraph 5, stated that the plaintiff purchased
the land "with the
intention to develop it by constructing a building consisting predominantly of
residential units with associated
commercial/retail areas ...".  The
development involved the demolition of the SBS Building.  Dr Quek traced the
submission of DA1
and various steps taken in relation to that and, in
paragraphs 8 and 9, recounted that the project was subject to the plaintiff's
obtaining all necessary consents from the Council, and that the plaintiff
intended to carry out the project so as to make a profit
for its shareholders
by the sale of the units.  None of this evidence was in issue.
<P>

54   	The concluding three paragraphs of the statement were:-
<P>

<b>"10.	If I had known that the consent to DA1082/94 was invalid as at 8

<P>

<b>(a)	caused Lavender View to submit building application 95/275 or caused
that application to be prosecuted.  This building application
was approved by

<b>(b)	caused Lavender View to obtain Council's consent to the demolition of

the date 1 October 1995, to commence bulk
excavations.</b>
<P>

<b>  11.	In addition, if I had been informed as at 8 February 1995, that there

proceed with the sale or the refurbishment and sale of the SBS Building</u>.  I
refer to a memorandum I received from Geoff Davey dated 5 September 1995."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

Paragraph 10 set out what Dr Quek would not have done had he known that the
consent to DA1 was invalid as at 8 February 1995.  Put
shortly he would not
have had the plaintiff carry out any steps to further the development
conformably with that consent.  Dr Quek
does not say, in that paragraph, what
he would have done.  In paragraph 11 he dealt with what he would have done if
he had been informed
of the matters to which he referred.  This paragraph was
directed to the difficulties confronted in obtaining consent to develop
"a
substantially similar development, or a development of similar size", a matter
with which he dealt further in paragraph 12, which
paragraph reinforced his
wish "for a suitably similar project or development of similar size".
Paragraphs 11 and 12 make clear that
Dr Quek wanted "a substantially similar
development" or "a development of similar size".  This was his evidence as at
28 May 1998
and it was strongly corroborative of that part of the Council's
case which focussed on that desire of Dr Quek and led, as the Council's
submissions ran, to the steps he took prior to the submission of DA4.  It is
also to be noted that the plaintiff's claim for damages
was not predicated on
any of the hypotheses in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12.
<P>

55   	There was no suggestion in these paragraphs that but for
the potential invalidity of DA1, he would have caused 102(2) to be
lodged in
late March or early April 1996, notwithstanding the importance this assumed in
the case the plaintiff ultimately presented.

<P>

56   	Dr Quek made a further statement on 13 November 1998.  He
referred to evidence he gave on 29 July 1998 in which he made reference
to an
instruction to lodge a s.102 application, and to his having said that had the
Council rejected that application, being 102(1),
for whatever reason, he would
then, depending on the objections, probably have appealed.  He said he did not
proceed with that application
because the necessity for it was superseded by
the decision to submit  DA2.  Part of the Council's case was that Dr Quek would
have
relied on DA2 in early 1996 in an attempt to achieve his objectives, which
would have been, arguably, at odds with the making of
102(2).  His evidence is
corroborative of the evidence that DA2 would have been lodged irrespective of
any challenge to the validity
of DA1, and, of course, if DA2 had been approved,
it would have rendered DA1 and 102(2) unnecessary. The reason submitted for
pursuing
DA2 and 102(2), in the hypothetical case, was that the plaintiff
thereby had two approaches.  That does not answer the question why
two
approaches were necessary in the hypothetical case when there was no challenge
to DA1.  The more likely answers are that, firstly,
the plaintiff did not wish
to proceed with DA1 and, therefore, did not lodge 102(2) in about March 1996,
but that it wanted to build
conformably with DA2, which it in fact lodged in
April 1996.  He continued, in paragraph 5:-
<P>

<b>"I also made reference, in my evidence, to the fact that in October 1996 I
purported or attempted to lodge a section 102 application,
which the Council
rejected.  This was submitted for two reasons.  First, the Land and Environment
Court had determined  the second
development application by a refusal, after
the Council rejected it.  Although there was some doubt as to the validity of
DA1082/94,
there remained, in my mind, the possibility that it could be built,
and I was aware that the development as represented by DA1082/94
would require
to be modified so that it complied with the provisions of the Building Code of
Australia.  Secondly, I had been advised
that, if Lavender View Pty Limited
(Lavender View) instituted proceedings against Council based on the invalidity
of DA1082/94, it
would need to be able to demonstrate that DA1082/94 could have
been built.  For that reason, Lavender View should submit a section
102
application that was totally compliant with that DA save for changes necessary
to bring it into compliance with the Building
Code of Australia."</b>
<P>

The first stated reason is strongly corroborative of the view that 102(2) would
not have been submitted, on the hypothetical case
basis, at the same time as
DA2, but that that was only done, and would only have been done, after DA2 was
rejected and in consequence
of that rejection.  That corroboration is provided
by virtue of the belief that notwithstanding some doubt as to the validity of
DA1, there remained in Dr Quek's mind the possibility that, subject to
modification to comply with BCA, development could have proceeded
conformably
with DA1.  If there was no doubt about the validity of DA1 it is difficult to
see why the same chronology would not have
been followed, i.e. 102(2) would
have been lodged after DA2 had been finally determined, if 102(2) was
necessary, as it would have
been.
<P>

57   	Commencing at paragraph 6 Dr Quek said that he assumed
that no proceedings had been launched to challenge DA1, and that the
consent to
that development application was unchallenged "and, in fact, there was no risk
of any legal challenge to it".  He referred
in paragraph 7 to the entry by the
plaintiff into the building contract with Multiplex on 12 January 1996, with a
date for practical
completion of January 1998, and to his concern to ensure
that the date for practical completion was not delayed.  In paragraph 8
he
stated:-
<P>

<b>"In those circumstances, if I had been advised that the first section 102
was unlikely to be approved by Council or the Land and Environment
Court on
appeal, then I would most probably have instructed that a further section 102
application be lodged which would be likely
to be accepted, either by the
Council or the Land and Environment Court on appeal without delay, so that any
delay to the progress
of construction could, if possible, be avoided or
minimised."</b>
<P>

This paragraph suggested that if Dr Quek had been so advised he would, in all
probability, have given instructions for 102(2) to
be lodged in March or April
1996.
<P>

58   	In paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 Dr Quek dealt with DA3 and
noted his instructions to Peddle Thorp &amp; Walker  that:-
<P>

<b>"I would like you to produce a design and submit a development application
which, as far as possible, maximises the commercial use
of the land for
residential development, while taking into account the comments of the Land
&amp; Environment Court in the judgment
which constituted the determination of
DA2."</b>
<P>

59   	In paragraph 12 Dr Quek referred to the refusals of the
appeals by the Court in relation to DA2 and DA3, and stated:-
<P>

<b>"In neither instance was I advised that there was no prospect of the appeal
succeeding.  I attended the hearing of both of the Class
I appeals.  At the end
of each hearing I was optimistic that the DA would be determined by
consent."</b>
<P>

Thus Dr Quek, who was an experienced developer, saw no good reason not to
pursue either DA2 or DA3, both of which would have provided
the type of
building the plaintiff was seeking to build.  There is no justification for
believing that the plaintiff would have acted
differently in the hypothetical
case in seeking to maximise the development.
<P>

60   	The balance of the statement dealt with loss of
opportunity which, save for one minor matter, is no longer relevant.
<P>

61   	In his statement of 7 March 1999 Dr Quek annexed a note of
a meeting with his legal advisers, which apparently took place
in the chambers
of Mr Tobias on 20 October 1996, when there was a review and overview of DA1
and an opinion as to its likely validity.
 The note indicates that it was most
likely fundamentally flawed through the Council's negligence in not properly
assessing SEPP
1 objections at the time of its submission, and that the Class
IV proceedings were to be considered next, and, after certain consideration
as
to whether and how those proceedings may go forward, it was stated that if they
proceeded "then DA1 will be declared void and
6/6A's development potential
reduced".  The note continued:-
<P>

<b>"8.	Dependent on the strategy of timing the following needs to
happen.</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	Determine the Class 4, or determine whether it will be
reactivated.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	If not to be reactivated, then submit a section 102 and BA to NSC based
on DA1 which only addressed the BCA issues.  NSC will
be bound to deal with it
since it is not contesting the validity of DA1.  If not dealt with after forty
days then go through the
normal appeal process.</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	If Bingham or NSC wish to reactivate the Class 4 then submit a new DA
along the line of Talbot's decision."</b>
<P>

The reference to Mr Bingham is because he was the person who, apparently, was
principally involved in initiating the Class IV proceedings.
 The suggestion
that 102(2) should be pursued seems to spring from that conference, and not
from any earlier consideration which
would have operated if there had been no
negligence, and 102(2) was lodged the day after the conference.
<P>

62   	In his statement Dr Quek said that he received advice in
relation to the submission of DA3 and his obligation to mitigate
damages, and
he recorded, in paragraph 6, the following oral advice given by Mr Tobias:-
<P>

<b>"I think you should submit a further development application, taking
carefully into account the contents of Talbot J's decision in
the determination
of DA2.  You should also bear in mind that if and when DA1 is declared null and
void and you decide to sue North
Sydney Council for negligence, you should be
seen to have acted reasonably in mitigating any damages sustained by you as a
result
of the Council's negligence."</b>
<P>

DA3 was prepared and lodged on 18 December 1996, two days after the Council
determined 102(2) by rejection.
<P>

63   	He continued that, to the best of his recollection, that
advice was given in October 1996 after DA2 had been determined  by
the judgment
of Talbot J, which must have been so having regard to the terms of the advice,
and that the obligation to mitigate damages
was a consistent theme of the legal
advice he obtained "since doubt was first cast on the validity of DA1".  He
said similar advice
was given shortly after DA3 had been determined by
rejection by the Court, which occurred on 29 August 1997, once again by Mr
Tobias
in conference.  He continued, in paragraph 9:-
<P>

<b>"This advice was part of the reason why I gave Andrew Andersons the
instructions in relation to maximisation which I refer to in paragraph
11 of my
statement of November 13.  As I understood it, if DA3 took into account the
problems raised in Talbot J's judgment but maintained
a similar net saleable
area to that of DA1, then I would be seen to have acted reasonably in limiting
the damages suffered  by Lavender
View."</b>
<P>

Although Mr Tobias submitted that DA3 would not have been pursued but for the
legal challenge to DA1, I am satisfied that it was
part of the natural
progression by the plaintiff to seek to maximise the development, and it would,
therefore, have followed the
rejection of DA2.
<P>

64   	Subsequently in the statement Dr Quek referred to problems
in relation to balconies on the boundary between 6 and 6A Cliff
Street not
complying with the requirements of the BCA, and extensions westward to the
apartments at Levels 15 and 19.  He said a
meeting was held with an officer of
the Council, Mr Darroch, which appears to have been in February 1996, when Mr
Darroch said to
him that he did not feel that the current s.102 application,
which was 102(1), would be approved unless amendments were made to the
setbacks
on the boundary and the extensions on Levels 15 and 19.  He said Mr Darroch
continued:-
<P>

<b>"You will be required to submit not only a new section 102 but an amended BA
in order to remedy the breaches to both BCA on the boundary
with 6 and 6A as
well as to delete the proposed extensions to Level 15 and 19."</b>
<P>

65   	Dr Quek said that after the meeting he instructed Mr
Swalwell to proceed with the necessary drawings in preparation for these
submissions and:-
<P>

<b>"Having spoken to the planners personally for the first time at that meeting
I was convinced that there was no other route to be taken
but to submit amended
plans as requested.  I was disappointed because we had sold some of the flats
that would be affected by the
requested changes."</b>
<P>

The evidence makes it clear that Dr Quek "never believed section 102 number 1
would be approved after Mr Darroch had given his advice"
in February 1996:
Tp.81. Notwithstanding Mr Darroch's advice, a new s.102 application was not
submitted.  Dr Quek said that that
he had been advised that a defect within
102(1) was that it was not substantially the same development as DA1: Tpp.84-5,
and at Tp.107
he said:-
<P>

<b>"MR WALKER: Q. In February '96 you knew that the Multiplex plans were
different from DA1, didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. In February '96 you knew that the BA plans were different from DA1,
didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And in February '96 you knew that 102 number 1 could not be approved,
didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. In its own form, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And those three things I asked you about you knew at the same time,
didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And they meant that DA1 had ceased to be the building in the form you
wanted to build it; isn't that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Not necessarily so."</b>
<P>

Dr Quek was then cross-examined about that which the plaintiff wanted to build.
I shall refer to this evidence.
<P>

66   	It is necessary to keep firmly in mind that the
plaintiff's primary case was that but for the asserted invalidity of DA1 it
would have submitted 102(2) in March/April 1996.  In paragraph 20 Dr Quek
continued:-
<P>

<b>"However, subsequently on advice from my legal advisers including Mr Tobias
it was decided that it would be better to submit a fresh
development
application instead of an amended 102 because of the risk that if the original
development application was declared invalid
any modification of it would be
invalid as well.  To the best of my recollection Mr Swalwell was instructed to
issue a new development
application in March 1996 and the original 102
amendment application was abandoned."</b>
<P>

The "original 102 amendment application" is a reference to 102(1).  The clear
inference is that 102(1) was abandoned for the reasons
set out in Dr Quek's
evidence in paragraph 65, and because the plaintiff did not wish to proceed
with that building.  This was reinforced
by the evidence of Dr Quek at
Tpp.98-99, which culminated in his agreement that the plaintiff "did with DA2,
on an urgent timetable,
following Mr Darroch's advice effectively the same
thing as you would have done had there been no legal challenge".  Thus, so the
Council's submission ran, DA1 ceased to be the vehicle through which
development was pursued and DA2 became the means nextly pursued.
 When all the
evidence is considered I am of the view that this submission should be
accepted. 
<P>

67   	In his opening, Tp.10, after referring to Mr Darroch's
statement to Dr Quek that in all probability the Council would not
approve
102(1), because it did not consider that it was substantially the same
development, and that that application was abandoned,
Mr Tobias said:-
<P>

<b>"Given that there was a challenge to that consent, then there was little
point in pursuing the 102 application until that challenge
had been determined.
That's why it was thought better to go back to square one, as it were, and
lodge DA2, which of course would
be untainted if consent to it was granted by
the challenge to DA1."</b>
<P>

DA2 was lodged on 4 April 1996.  However, the opening was not supported by the
evidence called by the plaintiff, and particularly
by that of Dr Quek.  The
evidence established to my satisfaction that DA2 would have been lodged when it
was whether or not there
was a legal challenge.
<P>

68   	At Tp.12 Mr Tobias said:-
<P>

<b>"It is common ground that the first one" (102(1)) "the December 1995 one,
would not have been approved because the view was that it
was not substantially
the same development.  It might have prejudiced people who objected to the
original application."</b>
<P>

69   	He continued, Tp.13:-
<P>

<b>"The one that would have been approved was the one that ultimately was
lodged on 21 October 1996, except our case is that it would
have been lodged
back in February or March 1996 had it not been for the legal challenge because
it was the legal challenge that necessitated
the lodgment and the pursuing of
DA2.</b>
<P>

<b>.... either in February or March of 1996.  This becomes of some critical
significance because of the delay factor involved in terms
of the plaintiff's
damages.  Your Honour, as I have said, the Class I appeal for DA2 had been
lodged on 28 May 1996.  The builder
ran out of work to do legally and the
contract works were suspended on 28 June after he had finished the bulk
excavation because
of the challenge to the development consent, which, of
course, if that went down, then so would any building approval upon which
it
was based, including any s.102 approval upon which it was based."</b>
<P>

70   	Therefore Mr Tobias was making it clear that the
plaintiff's case was that having been told in February 1996 that 102(1) would
not be approved, which was accepted, it became necessary to either prepare a
new s.102 modification, which, having regard to the
challenge to the validity
of DA1, would not have been of any effect if DA1 was held to be invalid, or to
prepare another development
application.  The course was taken of submitting
DA2, rather than 102(2) at that stage.  His opening that it was the "legal
challenge",
which stimulated DA2, has to be considered in the light of the
evidence that DA2 would have been lodged irrespective of the legal
challenge,
which establishes that DA2 was not stimulated by the legal challenge and would
have been lodged irrespective of it because
DA1 was not the vehicle through
which the plaintiff wished to exploit the land.
<P>

71   	The Council determined DA2 and DA3 by refusal and, on
appeal from each such refusal, Talbot J dismissed each appeal holding,
put
shortly, that the development proposed was still too large.
<P>

72   	At Tp.17 Mr Tobias stated:-
<P>

<b>"Had there been no legal challenge, it is our case that the s.102
application, that is the October 1996 s.102 application, would have
been lodged
in February, early March of 1996 and would have been approved by the end of
April, early May 1996 by the Council on the
recommendation of Mr Darroch and Mr
Epstein."</b>
<P>

This hypothesis did not involve the possibility of determination by rejection
and an approval on appeal to the Court, which the
plaintiff initially expressly
disclaimed. The submission relied solely on the assumption of a favourable
recommendation from Mr Darroch
and that the councillors would have accepted it
and approved 102(2).  Mr Darroch had no involvement with DA2 after 4 April
1996.
<P>

73   	He continued that it would then have been necessary to
amend the building approval, which would have been approved "within
a couple of
months" with the consequence that the works would never have been suspended and
Multiplex would have continued to erect
the building in accordance with the
building programme it had undertaken. For the reasons I have given the
hypothesis on which this
time sequence was based did not contemplate initially
an appeal and, therefore, did not assume a determination by the Council by
rejection.
<P>

74   	Mr Tobias' submissions continued that by September 1996,
when the marketing programme stopped as a consequence of the challenge
to the
validity of the consent, some 103 of the 166 units had been sold with a total
contract value of about $53.7m.  He submitted
that in September 1996, after
Talbot J refused DA2, it was realised that the configuration of the building
would have to change radically,
with the result that all those contracts would
have to be terminated, and that the chances of being able to rely on DA1 were
dependent
upon the Class IV proceedings, and:-
<P>

<b>"The plaintiff's case will be that the building would have proceeded
unhindered and it would have received the proceeds of sale in
or about April of
1998.  What has happened, however, is that the plaintiff has pursued, and has
been required to pursue, DA2, DA3
and DA4 to ultimately obtain a valid consent
in circumstances where, firstly, it has incurred significant expense in
relation to
each of those development applications, secondly, it has been
required to pay Multiplex money, part of which is now wasted, and,
thirdly, it
has incurred liability for interest not only to the bankers but also to its
shareholders in respect of which it obtained
loans that, together with the
share capital of Lavender View, under the original acquisition of the land for
some $11m odd and also
funded the obtaining of the development consent in
February 1995."</b>
<P>

75   	Mr Tobias opened, and so much did not seem to be in
dispute, that all the contracts were ultimately terminated and the plaintiff
had to restart selling the units in DA4.  The approval is for 141 units in DA4
as opposed to 166 units in DA1.  The modification
proposed in 102(2) did not
reduce the number of units below 166.  A basic question is whether the
plaintiff could ever have obtained
development approval for a building of
sufficient size to provide for more than 141 units.
<P>

76   	I did not request Mr Walker to open but, on 10 March 1999
at a time which was convenient, I invited him to address me as to
the Council's
case.  At Tp.322 Mr Walker said that the issue in terms of identifying whether
any loss was suffered revolved entirely
around the status of DA1 in the
financial fortunes of the plaintiff, there being no doubt that the plaintiff is
to be treated as
an entity intending to exploit the land.  He submitted that
the first question was whether DA1 was ever the vehicle intended to be
used for
that exploitation, because it had within it an element, which meant that one
could never be secure as a developer simply
with DA1, namely that a building
that would be consistent with it could not be built in accordance with building
codes and thus the
requisite building application would necessarily differ to
some extent from  the building plans submitted with DA1.
<P>

77   	Mr Walker relied upon the fact that even before Dr Quek
was aware of any challenge to the validity of DA1, an acceptance of
and
reliance on it necessarily involved the plaintiff's being put back into the
hands of the Council for the purpose of its modification
pursuant to s.102 and
in relation to the building plans.  Mr Walker continued:-
<P>

<b>"In the hypothetical case, he" (Dr Quek) "would have been correct in
believing it to be valid.  That's the only difference between
the actual case
and the hypothetical case for this part of 1995.  His conduct would have been
no different."</b>
<P>

By that Mr Walker meant that although Dr Quek would have been entitled to
believe he had a valid consent, he would have been left
with the difficulties
of making it operative by either obtaining the additional consents, which were
necessary before it could be
built, or applying for another development
application.
<P>

78   	Mr Walker's submissions continued that when DA1 was
submitted it was not, in any way, influenced by the Council's negligence,
which
is undoubtedly correct.  Accordingly, DA1 represented what would have happened
hypothetically, as well as what happened actually
in the progression to the
desired exploitation of the land, i.e. irrespective of any alleged invalidity,
(for none was then suggested),
DA1 would have been submitted.
<P>

79   	Mr Walker continued, Tp.326, that 102(1) did not reduce,
or did not reduce more than minimally, what had been proposed, and
that DA2 was
put up in consequence of a business risk taken by Dr Quek, which he thought
was worth taking to get what he wanted.
 Mr Walker submitted that there was no
reason why Dr Quek would have acted more cautiously if he thought DA1 was
valid, than if he
thought it was invalid.  He said that Dr Quek was well
advised, and that in relation to DA's 2 and 3 he once again took the risk.
 He
continued that DA's 2 and 3 were submitted because Dr Quek wanted to build
something different from DA1 and because, in any event,
he was back in the
hands of the Council under DA1.
<P>

80   	At Tp.330 Mr Walker said that the position could be summed
up by saying that DA4 was the best the plaintiff could achieve
and that there
was no loss which had anything to do with any supposed differential between a
hypothetical development and the actual
development.  Mr Walker submitted that
there were four answers to the submission that 102(2) would have been submitted
in March or
April 1996. Firstly, that Dr Quek had denied that would have
occurred.  Secondly, that on the narrative as he had outlined it there
was no
reason to suppose in commonsense why it would have occurred, there being
nothing in the nature of the hypothetical case, that
is one which accepted the
validity of DA1, that meant that the plaintiff would have proceeded to 102(2)
any earlier than it did;
thirdly, that Dr Quek only intended to use DA1 as a
launching pad; and, finally, even if 102(2) had been submitted earlier both the
Council and the Court would have refused the application or, to put it more
accurately, that the plaintiff has not proved, on the
balance of probabilities,
that this would not have happened.  I have noted that it was not part of the
plaintiff's initial submissions
that 102(2), if lodged in March/April 1996,
would have been determined by rejection, thus necessitating an appeal to the
Court.
<P>

<b>The Oral Evidence Of Dr Quek</b>
<P>

81   	Dr Quek agreed, in cross-examination, that he met Mr
Darroch in February 1996 in the presence of Mr Swalwell and some others,
and
that Mr Darroch told him that he did not think 102(1) would be supported in its
current form and that there would have to be
reduction in scale.  He knew at
that time that the scale or bulk of the development was controversial and,
having been furnished
with the information by Mr Darroch, he told Mr Swalwell
that he, Mr Swalwell, would need to look at the s.102 modification application
to see where it could be reduced.  Dr Quek regarded that as an instruction to
Mr Swalwell, and, in February 1996, he understood that
a reduction in overall
bulk of the development was required, which may have involved a reduction in
the saleable floor space. These
concessions pointed to a far more wide ranging
reduction in size and bulk than those contended for by Mr Tobias as involving
some
change to balconies and reduction in creep.  The evidence of Mr Darroch
confirmed, in my opinion, that the need for reduction was
of the type Dr Quek
conceded.
<P>

82   	Dr Quek said he was not able to point to documents, which
reduced the scale in March or April 1996, including a reduction
of scale for a
s.102 modification application: Tp.67.
<P>

83   	Dr Quek made it clear that, whilst disappointed with Mr
Darroch's advice, he accepted it and whilst he thought reductions
could be
made, that was never done: Tp.68.  He repeated, Tp.69, that he believed
reductions were possible, and that he was determined
that there be no reduction
in the net saleable area.  At Tp.70 Dr Quek said he knew and believed the scale
could be reduced.  When
he was asked whether he accepted that his instructions
were never carried out he replied:-
<P>

<b>"Events followed where it was decided to proceed with a new DA",</b>
<P>

that being the lodging of DA2 on 4 April 1996.  Dr Quek agreed, Tp.71,  that
the kind of development proposed by DA2 was more or
less the same as proposed
by the combination of DA1 and 102(1), and, at Tp.72, that in certain areas the
bulk of DA1, when aggregated
with 102(1), was too great.  But he disagreed that
DA2 did not effect any reduction, although, soon after he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. What reduction in scale or bulk was introduced by DA2 below the
aggregate of DA1 and s.102 No 1?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I would say in the scale of things it would very minimal.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So minimal that they can, for all intents and purposes, be treated as the
same in this Court, can't they?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No it affected the ...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Were they minimal or not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. DA 2..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Were they minimal or not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Minimal in terms of the bulk, yes."</b>
<P>

84   	At Tp.75 Dr Quek repeated that the reduction in DA2 was
minimal, and continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Which means, does it not, that the business decision for which you
personally were responsible at the time was one which took
the risk that if you
didn't follow Mr Darroch's advice, you would not get approval; do you
agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And you took that risk because the rewards for the company were such as
to render it a reasonable business decision, you thought,
to chance your arm
with a new DA which did not reduce bulk; is that correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Right up to and including the lodgment in April 1996 of DA2 you knew,
didn't you, that you had to get approval for a 102 modification
or approval of
a new DA before you could proceed with the project; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

The second answer is strongly suggestive of Dr Quek's being concerned only with
DA2 at that stage, and the third answer is somewhat
suggestive of this, in the
sense that DA2 was the course adopted in preference to 102(2).  However, the
suggested invalidity could
have remained a reason for this, although, on the
whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that DA2 would have been lodged when it
in
fact was irrespective of the suggested invalidity of DA1.
<P>

85   	At Tp.76 Dr Quek agreed that he knew from a very early
stage, even before DA1 was approved, that the building application
may well
introduce variations or refinements of the design contained in the DA1
drawings, and that whether the changes introduced
at the building application
stage needed a modification of DA1 depended on judgments made "by the
regulators".  
<P>

86   	He also agreed that he knew, at least by February 1996,
that there was a controversy in relation to the bulk of developments
"like
yours".  At Tp.78 he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. We will return then to February 96 and the conversation with Mr Darroch.
In light of what you've told us, Dr Quek, it was very
clear to you by then that
unless there could be approval of a 102 modification or a new DA, your project
could not go ahead as you
wanted it; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Unless there were changes, yes."</b>
<P>

87   	He agreed that at that time he probably did not want a
reduction in the net saleable area, and that the only thing stopping
a
reduction in bulk and scale was his desire to maximise profit.  It is clear
that this commercially understandable reason lead to
the lodgment of DA2, and,
also, to the submission that but for the alleged invalidity 102(2) would have
been submitted earlier.
<P>

88   	Dr Quek agreed that he knew from February 1996 that 102(1)
would never be approved, but he would not agree that he never had
any reason to
believe that DA2 would not be approved.  He agreed, Tp.83, that when he lodged
DA2 it made no concession to reduction
in bulk advised by Mr Darroch and
notwithstanding the existing controversy about that, nor to the changes in the
composition of the
Council.
<P>

89   	At Tpp.84-85 Dr Quek agreed that he had been told that a
defect with 102(1) was that the development was no longer substantially
the
same development, and that there needed to be a reduction in bulk to have
prospects of approval.  However, he said that he believed
that that was in
certain restricted areas.
<P>

90   	At Tp.91 Dr Quek said that an important reason for
proceeding with DA2 was because of the challenge to DA1, and the alternative,
"but for that problem, would have been to accept Mr Darroch's advice and modify
102(1)".
<P>

91   	It was put to Dr Quek, Tp.92, that DA2 was a project which
was very similar to the combination of DA1 and 102(1), with which
he agreed
essentially, and that the adoption of the course involving such a proposal did
not follow Mr Darroch's advice totally.
 Dr Quek said that he followed the new
DA2 route, rather than the amended 102 route, because of the legal challenge.
Up to this point,
subject to the evidence at Tp.75 which I have quoted, it had
seemed reasonably clear, and prima facie logical, that DA2 was the result
of
the legal challenge to DA1.  However, at Tp.95, Dr Quek continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. The work they did to amend the 102 involved considerations which were
relevant to the eventual form of DA2; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. What they were asked to do was to change its form from a 102 amendment to
a new DA; isn't that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, and also to negotiate with Council in the form that was required by
Council.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. All of which would have happened with or without a legal challenge; isn't
that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. It follows, doesn't it, that there is no reason you can give why there
would have been a section 102 in the form of section 102
number 2 in February
or March 96 in the absence of a legal challenge; do you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

92   	This evidence, if accepted and given its full weight, was
substantially destructive of the primary basis on which the plaintiff
put its
case, because it acknowledged, firstly, that the architects were asked to
change the form from "a 102 amendment to a new
DA", which Dr Quek agreed would
have happened with or without a legal challenge, and, secondly, that in the
absence of a legal challenge
Dr Quek could advance no reason why there would
have been a 102(2) in February or March 1996.  In giving the evidence Dr Quek
did
not appear to be under any misapprehension and, in submissions, it was not
suggested that he was.  It was submitted that his evidence
had to be read in
context and allowing for the fact that he may have made a mistake under
cross-examination, and that it would be
wrong to make a finding based "on one
unguarded answer in the witness box three years after the event".  Earlier Mr
Tobias had said
that one could not do much about the concession at Tp.428, to
which I shall refer, but that it had to be read "against the context
of his
other evidence on the same topic".  A little earlier, Tp.485, Mr Tobias
conceded that the evidence on when DA2 would have
been lodged "is mixed", and
that there could be no doubt "that Mr Walker put questions to Dr Quek perfectly
clearly, perfectly properly,
to assert that he would have put in DA2
irrespective of the challenge".  However, the evidence is consistent with the
evidence quoted
in paragraphs 66 and 77, and particularly the answer to the
second question quoted in paragraph 77.  It also put in context the answer
to
the third question, in that it acknowledged that rather than follow the 102(2)
path, the DA2 one was chosen.
<P>

93   	The cross-examination continued, Tpp.95-96:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Following your awareness of the legal challenge it was, I suppose,
important for you that DA1 was vulnerable and might be declared
invalid; is
that correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That was the legal advice I had, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You, on the other hand, remained confident right to the bitter end that
it would be saved; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So when his Honour comes to look at your conduct to evaluate what you
would have done in a different position, he's looking, is
he, at the conduct of
a man confident that DA1 would be upheld but accepting advice to be careful in
case you were wrong; is that
correct?  Is that how you would describe
yourself?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Not exactly.  I would say that I was unable to believe, with the
experience that I had, that the development approval approved
by an approving
body could have had a legal challenge such as that.  I've never met up with it
before.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Leaving aside your fortunate life as a developer, Dr Quek, by then you
knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was happening and
to you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Exactly.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. From when you knew that, should his Honour treat you as a person who,
although optimistic about DA1, nonetheless took steps to
be careful lest you
were wrong?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. The first thing you did in that spirit was to lodge DA2 rather than
merely an amended 102? </b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

94   	This evidence, in my opinion, was of significance, because
it established that from the time Dr Quek became aware of the legal
challenge
to the validity of DA1, which was in early 1996, he chose the course, although
acting carefully, of lodging DA2 rather
than an amended 102.  Therefore,
notwithstanding that Dr Quek remained confident that DA1 would be upheld, he
did not take the step,
which would have been consistent with that belief, viz
of lodging 102(2), but lodged DA2.  This is significant because if he had
intended to lodge 102(2) in March/April 1996, his confidence in DA1 and reasons
for believing that it would be upheld, would have
meant, in my opinion, that he
would have done so.
<P>

95   	Dr Quek agreed, Tp.97, that from April to August 1996 the
plaintiff was working on an urgent timetable to get DA2 through,
and that all
steps taken by the plaintiff both to mitigate its loss and to press on with the
project were taken as urgently as possible.
 By the end of August 1996 he knew
that DA2 had struck an obstacle in the form of the Council's rejection, and
that there was still
a fundamental problem for the project about bulk and
scale.
<P>

96   	On 21 October 1996, 102(2) was lodged at a time when Dr
Quek regarded DA2 as no longer a justified reason for optimism, although
he was
still optimistic about the validity of DA1, in the sense that he said he had to
be as it was the only thing on which he could
rely.  He agreed that on 21
October 1996, treating DA1 as still something that might be saved, 102(2) was
lodged, and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And that, when you look back on it all, that step would not have been
taken any earlier with or without the legal challenge, would
it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That would have been a natural step following the advice I had from
Darroch, if not from a legal adviser.  I would substitute that
with ..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Why didn't you take it straight away?  It was the natural step ..</b>
<P>

<b>MR TOBIAS: You interrupted him, Mr Walker.</b>
<P>

<b>MR WALKER: Sorry.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Is there something you want to add?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I said that that particular 102(2), as you referred to it, would have
been the logical step that would have been taken after Darroch
had said he
would not accept a 102(1) if not for the advice that the DA - that DA1 could be
invalid and it was best to work towards
a new DA": Tp.98.</b>
<P>

This seemed a reasonable explanation for not proceeding with 102(2) in view of
the legal challenge to DA1, although the evidence
has to be considered in the
light of all his evidence, much of which was not consistent with this approach.
Of particular significance
is the evidence of Dr Quek's confidence in DA1,
which I have quoted in paragraph 93. The initial question is whether 102(2)
would
have been pursued, rather than DA2, but for the legal challenge.  If that
question is answered in the affirmative, the next is what
would have been the
fate of 102(2).  In my opinion, however, it should be answered in the negative.
The evidence satisfies me that
DA2 would have been pursued in April 1996 and
that 102(2) would not have been lodged until 21 October 1996.
<P>

97   	At Tp.99, Dr Quek said:-
<P>

<b>"<u>Q. Doesn't that mean that in terms of getting planning approval you did
with DA2, on an urgent timetable, following Mr Darroch's advice
effectively the
same thing as you would have done had there been no legal challenge</u>?
</b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But it turns out - and this is one of the development risks of this kind
of land owning - that both Council and the Court were
against you and so you
turned obviously to the next thing left for you; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And that turned out then to be DA3; is that correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This evidence made even clearer the evidence he had given earlier, viz that
even if there had been no legal challenge, so that the
hypothetical position
had become the actual position, Dr Quek, after receiving Mr Darroch's advice in
February 1996, would have pursued
DA2 and, if he had not succeeded with that,
DA3 would have been undertaken.  The first question clearly afforded Dr Quek
the opportunity
of asserting that he would have pursued 102(2).  I have no
doubt that Dr Quek would have referred to it if that had been his plan
and,
equally, no doubt that he did not refer to it because it was not part of his
development plan. 
<P>

98   	Dr Quek said, Tp.100, that 102(2)'s rejection did not come
as a surprise, but he added:-
<P>

<b>".. I believe <u>after</u> the DA2 was rejected at Court, <u>we went on to a
two-pronged attack</u>.  One was to submit a 102(2) and the other one was to
prepare drawings for a new DA, the DA3": Tp.100.   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This added emphasis to the fact that 102(2) would not have been pursued at the
same time as DA2, and that, irrespective of the legal
challenge, DA2 would have
preceded 102(2).  The "two-pronged attack" stemmed from the advice received
from Mr Tobias on 20 October
1996.  The submission that it would have been
followed earlier must, in my opinion, be rejected as being contrary to what
happened
and to Dr Quek's evidence.  I have recorded Mr Tobias' submission that
there was no direct evidence that DA2 and 102(2) would have
been lodged as a
two-pronged attack.
<P>

99   	At Tp.104 Dr Quek agreed that the salient difference
between DA3 and DA4 was a reduction in scale.  He said the prime reason
for
submitting DA4 was that the plaintiff had already failed to obtain approval for
two DA's, and instructions were given to talk
to the Council and find out what
it wanted and to build accordingly.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. So get the best you can; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's right.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Get the best you can?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Get the best from the Council officers at the time and the response from
the councillors.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So DA4 is the outcome of advice given to you and work for you to get the
best you could from the Council at the time; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

100   	At Tpp.105-106 Dr Quek agreed that the building
application required a development, which was not substantially the same
development as DA1, and that the Multiplex plans were "even more different from
DA1 than the BA plans", although he said the latter
changes were within the
acceptable parameters of changes that could have been done by negotiation or by
an amended BA.
<P>

101   	He was asked whether he set out by a building contract to
construct a building according to DA1 and he replied:-
<P>

<b>"DA1 as it was was a set of indicative drawings and indicative drawings had
to be progressed to a stage where there were more designs.
 When you come to
construction, you had to go from a DA to a BA and some more construction
definitions.  There are bound to be changes
in the development process.  When
we lodged a BA there were investigations - there were negotiations and I
believe meetings between
the architects and Council planners, and that's the
reason why I believe that a BA was approved and a DA was approved I'm sure not
by just the technical department but with the technical department's
consultation with the planning department.  I was confident
that at that time
whatever plans I had marketed would have been approved."</b>
<P>

102   	Thereafter Mr Walker pursued the question as to whether
there was an intention to have the project completed in accordance
with DA1,
and Dr Quek was cross-examined about the difference between the DA1 plans and
the building contract plans.  He agreed,
Tp.107, that in February 1996 he knew
the Multiplex plans were different from DA1, and that the BA plans were
different from DA1,
and that in its own form 102(1) could not be approved.  He
said those three pieces of information did not necessarily mean that DA1
had
ceased to be the building in the form he wanted to build it. I have set forth
this evidence in paragraph 66. He was then referred
to a minute of 8 March 1996
and agreed that at that time he suggested the plaintiff should lodge the
original development application
with BCA compliance "plus minor changes to the
balcony", which would constitute "a complying DA", and one different from DA1
under,
he hoped, a modification pursuant to s.102.  He was referred to the
words in the minutes about change "which would produce the building
in the form
we want to build it" and, in answer to the question that the building was
different from DA1, he said it would have been
a modification of the original
DA1, although he agreed that by that time he had been told that the
modification the plaintiff had
sought of DA1 could not be approved in its
current form and needed to have reduced scale.
<P>

103   	At Tpp.109-110 he was asked whether he agreed that the
minute showed that by mid-March 1996 the plaintiff did not intend
to turn the
land to commercial development in accordance with DA1, to which he replied
"Yes, it needed a 102". Notwithstanding this
answer, I am satisfied that he
decided on DA2 rather than 102(2). Dr Quek was cross-examined as to the
intention of the plaintiff
and, at Tp.111, he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Is it then correct that your company, regardless of the legal challenge,
regardless of the challenge or its success, intended
to develop this land
differently from DA1?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, in certain areas, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Your company regardless of the legal challenge, always intended to place
itself back in the hands of the Council to approve or
not approve the
development it wanted to build; do you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I disagree.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But you did set out to place yourself back in the hands of Council when
you lodged s.102 number 1, didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I was under the understanding that the ...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Mr Tobias can ask you questions to explain that.  If you could just
answer my question directly.  You did put yourself back in
the hands of the
Council in the form of s.102 number 1, didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And that was done quite regardless of the legal challenge, wasn't
it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

104   	Dr Quek agreed that to submit a s.102 application
necessitated putting the plaintiff "back in the hands of the Council regardless
of the challenge", and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. When you put in a BA which is different from the DA so as to require a
102 to be made, you've put yourself back in the hands of
Council again, haven't
you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And the company always intended to do that regardless of the legal
challenge, didn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

This evidence established a quite important cornerstone for the Council's case,
viz that irrespective of the legal challenge, the
plaintiff would have been
forced to seek further approval from the Council and there was no guarantee
that the Council would consent.
<P>

105   	After being referred to a letter from Bruce Swalwell
Architects, Dr Quek agreed, Tp.113, that what the plaintiff wished to
build was
a project different from DA1, which he clarified by saying that "it would be
DA1 with modification by s.102".  He had agreed
earlier, Tp.98, that that led
to a development relevantly the same as DA2.  This was a significant
concession, which went a considerable
way to establishing that DA1 was not the
means by which the land development would be implemented.  This applies even
allowing for
the qualification to the answer.
<P>

106   	Dr Quek was then referred to another communication from
the architects of 19 March 1996, which enclosed copy correspondence
with
Multiplex and which he agreed informed Multiplex "about a new DA".  He agreed
that in discussions about a new DA changes were
referred to as emanating both
from Greencliff and Multiplex.  He was referred to various changes, and
said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Because Lavender View Regency Pty Limited simply could not build what it
wanted to without fresh planning approval, which you
knew and accepted; is that
right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

107   	At Tp.120 Dr Quek said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. In order to build what it wanted to build, it either had to modify DA1
or get a new DA; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And to get a new BA or amended BA; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And the fact that the company was in that position at the end of March
1996 was not brought about, I suggest to you, by the legal
challenge to DA1; do
you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

What the plaintiff had to establish was that the course it would have taken to
build what it wanted, if there had been no legal
challenge, was by modifying
DA1 pursuant to s.102.  That was its primary case.  This evidence assists me in
concluding that that
is not what it would have done.  In my opinion, the
evidence establishes that if there had been no legal attack the plaintiff would
have pursued DA2 alone, and that the two-pronged attack of DA2 and 102(2) was
an idea of a much later date, if, indeed, it was ever
a proposal.
<P>

108   	Commencing at Tp.121 Dr Quek was cross-examined about the
risks inherent in the development and subsequent sale of the units.
 He agreed
that in building conformably with DA4 the plaintiff was in a position to offer
141 units, and that whether it would have
been in a position to offer the 166
units that it wanted to build depended on matters on which it took a calculated
risk.  He continued,
at Tpp.122-123:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And DA1 is not itself an approval to build the project you wanted to
build, is it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. DA1 was an approval to build a building.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Please, Dr Quek, we've been down here before.  You understood my
question, didn't you, perfectly well?  <u>DA1 was not an approval to build the
project you wanted to build; do you agree</u>?</b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>.</b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. What was offered to the market was not DA1; it was something which
might result from DA1 modified and a BA that might result from
a new DA and a
new BA; is that right?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You took the risk when you went to the market ..</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. .. about not being able to build what you promised to sell them; is that
right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No, I took the risk only after I was told by my architects and
consultants that the shape and form of what we're putting in for
the DA was
acceptable at Council.  That's the reason why the BA was submitted in that
form.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But by November you knew, did you not, that you had to put in a modified
DA to be able to build?</b>
<P>

<b>A. A modified section 102, yes, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So whatever else you may have believed, by November 95 you knew that you
were back in the hands of Council, didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. We knew that it was to submit a 102 to bring it in line with the BA
drawings.</b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. None of that came as a surprise because you already knew that DA1 had
been superseded in the mind of the company which wanted to
build something
different from DA1?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>A. I knew that DA1, the marketing drawings that were marketed were a
deviation from DA1. </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. You agree with what I say, don't you?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes, in certain areas</u>."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This evidence underscored the point that DA1 was not the development vehicle.
Therefore, even as a starting point, reliance on the
modification of DA1
conformably with s.102 was a shaky foundation for the plaintiff's primary case.
The concession that DA1 was not
an approval to build the project the plaintiff
wished to build makes it the more probable that DA2 would have been lodged when
it
was, irrespective of the legal challenge, and that the plaintiff would have
proceeded on that basis.
<P>

109   	Dr Quek agreed that the plaintiff reserved the right not
to proceed with the construction, to rescind the contracts and not
to be liable
for damages if it did so.  He further agreed that was a protection against
risk.  I am satisfied that Dr Quek was balancing
the risk of building as many
units as possible, and, ultimately achieving that end, as being of primary
importance even if it occasioned
some delay.  His acceptance of the risk
element in some of the steps taken makes this clear.  Accordingly, the
plaintiff, notwithstanding
that it had entered into contracts, retained the
right not to proceed with the construction at all, in which circumstances it
would
not be liable for damages or to complete in the circumstances set out in
Clause 34 of the contracts for sale in which event either
party was entitled to
rescind. This leads to the conclusion that Dr Quek proposed to cling
tenaciously to obtaining as many units
as possible and to taking the commercial
risk of achieving that, whilst the plaintiff could elect, under its contracts
for sale,
not to build at all, or not to complete.  The contractual position of
the plaintiff, in regard to not proceeding, appears from Special
Condition 52,
which provided:-
<P>

<b>"52	SPECIAL RIGHTS OF VENDOR</b>
<P>

<b>  52.1	Despite any other provision of this contract, the vendor reserves the
right to decide not to proceed with construction of the
Building and, if the
vendor so decides, the right to rescind.</b>
<P>

<b>  52.2	The vendor may exercise the rights reserved in clause 52.1 in the
vendor's absolute discretion.</b>
<P>

<b>  52.3	The vendor may only exercise the right to rescind reserved in clause
52.1 by written notice to the purchaser on or before 1
December 1995 and if
that right is not so exercised it may not be exercised.</b>
<P>

<b>  52.4	If the vendor rescinds under this clause 52 then:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the contract is rescinded from the beginning; and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the deposit is to be refunded to the purchaser immediately; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	all interest earned on the deposit is to be paid to the purchaser in
accordance with clause 27."</b>
<P>

However, that was only available until 1 December 1995.
<P>

Special Condition 34 provided:- 
<P>

<b>"34.	Completion Subject to Condition.</b>
<P>

<b>  34.1.	Completion is subject to and conditional on the registration of the
documents referred to in Schedule 2.</b>
<P>

<b>  34.2.	If the documents referred to in Schedule 2 are not registered on or
before the date stipulated in Schedule 3, then either
party may rescind by
written notice to the other.</b>
<P>

<b>  34.3.	The vendor must use all reasonable endeavours to have the documents
referred to in Schedule 2 registered on or before the
date stipulated in
Schedule 3."</b>
<P>

The document referred to in Schedule 2 was "Strata Plan", and the date
specified in Schedule 3 was "30 September 1998".
<P>

Thus, the plaintiff was entitled to rescind, conformably with this special
condition provided it used all reasonable endeavours.
 There was no evidence
that any purchaser took the stance that it had not.
<P>

110   	At Tp.153 Dr Quek agreed that the fate of DA2, DA3 and
s.102(2) "were pretty clear indications of failure by Lavender View
in gaining
a new consent"; that they were for what he would describe as substantially
similar development or development of a similar
size to DA1; and that if they
failed the plaintiff would be driven to look at something else.
<P>

111   	At Tp.155 Dr Quek said the plaintiff was forced to move
to a new development application, although he added that it could
have moved on
to a modified s.102 application.  He agreed that unless the plaintiff reduced
the scale, a modified s.102 application
"would be incapable of approval", and
that he was determined not to reduce the scale if he could help it and, at
Tp.156:-
<P>

<b>"Q. So you decided to chance your arm with a new development consent
altogether, didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. We put in a new development application that was reflective of DA1 and
the culmination of the BA that was approved.</b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. Given your commercial ambitions for this site, if you'd been told at
the beginning of 1995 that there was a legal defect with DA1,
you would have
lodged a development consent for a project substantially similar to it or of
similar size, wouldn't you</u>?</b>
<P>

<b><u>A. In early 1995?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. Yes</u>.</b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And it would have gone through the ordinary processes?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. As to whether it would be consented to or not; correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. When it actually came to doing that, you failed, didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. When it came to doing that?</b>
<P>

<b>Q. When you actually came to do that ..</b>
<P>

<b>A. But we had a consent in DA1.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Please, Dr Quek.  When it actually came to you putting in new development
applications for developments of substantially new sizes,
you failed, didn't
you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. We failed in getting the DA2 yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And DA3?</b>
<P>

<b>A. And DA3 yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You didn't succeed until you reduced in scale to DA4; is that
correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. But your assessment, given the advice you had from lawyers, from
planners, and from architects, was that the attempt was worthwhile?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>."  (My emphasis.)     </b>
<P>

The point of this questioning, obviously enough, was to show that the plaintiff
would have pursued the same course as it did, even
if told of a legal defect
with DA1 at the commencement of 1995.  That involved getting as many units as
possible, which, in turn,
included not making any compromises in size and bulk
until forced to do so.  In my opinion, this cross-examination assists in
concluding
that the plaintiff would have pursued the same course irrespective
of the invalidity of DA1 and the negligence of the Council.
<P>

112   	Mr Tobias submitted that the plaintiff would not have
made an application under s.102(1) to reduce the scale, bulk and size
of the
building because that would have meant that it did not cross the first s.102(1)
threshold.  I am satisfied that the plaintiff
neither wished to build the
development for which DA1 provided, nor that it was under any misapprehension
that unless it made substantial
concessions in relation to bulk and size, it
would receive consent.  DA2 was a fresh attempt to obtain as much as possible,
whilst
recognising the risk.
<P>

113   	Dr Quek was then asked whether, if there had been any
challenge to DA1 in early 1995, he would have taken the same course,
and he
said that he would have sought legal advice.  He agreed that if that advice was
that there was a prospect of getting a new
development consent for a
substantially similar size or substantially similar development he probably
would have pursued that course,
particularly given that that was what was
actually done in 1996.
<P>

114   	At Tpp.199-200 Dr Quek said:-
<P>

<b><u>"Q. The 102 number 1, DA2 and DA3, they were the developer's efforts to
change away from DA1 to get approval for what it wanted to
build, weren't
they?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. Dr Quek, please just answer my question.  Most of the work during what
you call the DA1 period are for plans, be they BA's or 102's
or other DA's,
which are different from DA1; do you agree</u>?</b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This reinforced that what the plaintiff wished to build was different from that
contemplated in DA1.  As I have said reliance on
the invalidity of DA1 as a
starting point for the assessment of damages, on the basis that this was what
the plaintiff would have
built if it could, ceases, therefore, to have the
significance it otherwise would.
<P>

115   	At Tp.202 Dr Quek said:-
<P>

<b> "MR WALKER: Q. There's no question in your mind that from the beginning of
1995, after consent was given to DA1, Greencliff's efforts
moved to plans which
were modifications of, alterations of DA1, including the BA, the contract
building plans to Multiplex, the 102
number 1, DA2, DA3 and 102 number 2; do
you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

116   	In re-examination, Tp.205, Dr Quek said that he did not
wish to reduce the net saleable area because some of the units had
been sold
and he had received legal advice that the plaintiff should mitigate its
loss.
<P>

117   	At Tp.208 Dr Quek was asked about DA2.  He said he did
not want to reduce the net saleable area at the time it was submitted
because
he had a series of meetings with his various advisers, including Mr Tobias, and
was told to submit a new DA to take in and
incorporate "what we would have
built".
<P>

118   	At Tp.210 Dr Quek said that at the time he lodged DA2 he
did not, based on legal advice, make any concession to reduction
in bulk and,
subsequently on that page, he said that he was advised that it was best to
proceed with a new development application
because an amended s.102 application
would fall if DA1 was declared void.
<P>

119   	At Tp.212 Mr Tobias read to Dr Quek the evidence he had
given at Tp.107, which I have quoted, and concluding with the answer
that it
was not necessarily so that DA1 had ceased to be the building in the form the
plaintiff wanted to build.  He was asked what
he meant by that and he said:-
<P>

<b>"I would say to you to answer is that the BA and the 102 that came from it
were refinements to the DA1 that was there, refinements
that take into unit
layouts, take into glass lines, take into balconies, and they were considered
by me to be minor changes.  I could
have, however, brought those back to DA1 at
any time."</b>
<P>

However, that would not have assisted the plaintiff because of the conditions
to which DA1 was subject.
<P>

120   	At Tpp.415-416, on the fourth day of the hearing, Mr
Tobias stated that he wished to make clear the basis upon which the
plaintiff
was putting its case.  He said that given the events that in fact occurred up
to and including October 1996 and the steps
taken by Dr Quek in relation to DA2
and 102(2) "then but for the defendant's negligence, the course of events would
have been as
follows":-
<P>

<b>"One, in December 1996 the Council would have approved that application
rather than have refused it.  As a consequence of that, it
would have taken
four or five weeks to prepare an amended building application, see Exhibit K,
and a further two months allowing
for the intervening holiday period for the
building application to have been determined by the Council.  The evidence of
that relied
upon is Mr Darroch's evidence in paragraphs 19, 20 and 26 of his
statement of 6 March, and some evidence I think of Mr Sanders that
I haven't
yet had the opportunity to identify.</b>
<P>

<b>As a consequence, that would take us to March 1997 and building works would
have been recommenced about a month later in April 1997.
 The basis of the
latter is that Mr Sanders proceeds upon the assumption, which we accept in his
evidence, that approval would have
been obtained and work would have been
recommenced in the same month, the month he of course refers to as November.
Therefore, work
would have recommenced in about April 1997.</b>
<P>

<b>The alternative scenario is based upon the defendant Council having refused
the 102(2), as in fact it did in December 1996, necessitating
an appeal which,
as your Honour knows from the chronology, was in fact lodged and taking that as
the starting point, the submission
we'll be putting is that one can infer, from
the evidence when that application would have been made to expedite that
appeal, that
given the pending building operations, the contract still being on
foot at that time, as the chronology indicates, expedition in
all probability
would have been granted and then the matter determined by the Land and
Environment Court in February or March of
1997, a decision the following month
as per Mr Sanders, an amending building approval approximately a month later
and, using the
same time gaps with construction, then recommencing in or about
May 1997.  They are the alternative fall back positions as against
Mr Sanders'
November 1997 that we wish to pursue."</b>
<P>

121   	Mr Tobias agreed that he had not articulated any such
case in opening and Mr Walker submitted that he should be allowed to
cross-examine Dr Quek in relation to it. Mr Tobias opposed that "in principle",
asserting that the way in which the claim was thus
put did not arise out of any
evidence that Dr Quek had or had not given.  He said it was "totally
hypothetical".  That is so, but,
of course, it had to rely on an evidentiary
foundation, that being, essentially, credible evidence that the plaintiff would
have
acted in this way.  I formed the opinion that Mr Walker should be granted
leave to further cross-examine Dr Quek and that cross-examination
commenced at
Tp.418.  Dr Quek agreed that it was his understanding that the plaintiff's case
"now includes" a version that 102(2)
would have been made when it actually was
and rejected by the Council, as it actually was.  He said that DA3 was lodged
simply and
solely because of the Council's negligence, and that he would not
have sought approval in the form of DA3 had DA1 been valid.
<P>

122   	At Tpp.420-421 Dr Quek said that he would not have taken
any steps towards DA3 had DA1 been valid, and that 102(2) represented
the
height of his ambition for this land if DA2 was rejected, although he said DA2
would not have been put forward but for the invalidity
of DA1. I do not accept
this evidence, which, in my opinion, was inconsistent with evidence given
earlier by Dr Quek to which I have
referred, and evidence he gave later, which
led to the concession made by Mr Tobias, which I have recorded.  Dr Quek said
that 102(1)
was withdrawn because he was told there was no use pursuing a s.102
application when DA1 "was going to be likely to be void". In
fact it was
conceded that 102(1) was doomed to failure.   This led to his being asked why
102(2) was pursued, and he said it came
up in October 1996 and:-
<P>

<b>"We applied for it after October in order to - because we were reliant on
the original DA1 we had applied at that time for a DA2,
which was both rejected
by Council and by L&amp;E Court.  We had at that time, therefore, to test the
validity of DA1 - rely on DA1
and so therefore a new section 102(2) was put
forward."</b>
<P>

This evidence was consistent with the advice Dr Quek said Mr Tobias gave in
October 1996.
<P>

123   	The evidence continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. I thought you just told his Honour that you switched from 102 number 1
to DA2 because you were told not to rely on the validity
of DA1; is that
right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Somehow that changed, did it, and later you were told to use 102 number 2
because you could rely on the validity of DA1; is that
what you mean to
suggest?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No.  At that time when DA2 became invalid or was - DA2 - sorry.  Can I
repeat myself?  At that time when DA2 was rejected by both
Council and the
L&amp;E Court, there was no option available for us but to fall back onto the
DA1.  </b>
<P>

<b>Q. You had already decided before lodging the 102 number 1 that you wanted
to build something different from, that is, at least a
modification of, DA1,
hadn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Section 102(1) was reflective of the BA.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So you say ..</b>
<P>

<b>A. That was approved.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. However, you were told that it would not be and could not be approved,
weren't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I was told it could not be approved because of the - because at that time
we were undergoing challenge from Mr Bingham, from the
neighbours next door":
Tp.422.</b>
<P>

124   	Dr Quek was challenged on that answer on the basis that
Mr Darroch had told him that 102(1) could not be approved and there
was a need
for a reduction in scale, which he said occurred in February 1996.  The
cross-examination continued and established that
the plaintiff took the DA2
route "which was more or less DA1 plus 102 number 1".  At Tp.424 Dr Quek
said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. In order to build the building you wanted to build, you put in DA2,
didn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. We did put in DA2 because of the fact that there was a challenge to it,
to the DA1.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You either had to put in a new DA - I won't go over the other day.  You
either had to put in a new DA?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Or a 102.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

125   	Dr Quek was taken through the steps which had been
followed, and he agreed that he made a two pronged approached with DA3
and
102(2) in October 1996, which corroborated that that approach was made well
after DA2 had been lodged and rejected by the Council
and on appeal.  He agreed
that if DA1 was valid the plaintiff would still have needed further building
and planning approval to build
what it wanted, that it still would have
abandoned 102(1), and that it still would have attempted and failed with DA2.
However, he
disagreed that the next step, even without negligence, with the new
team of architects and a fresh approach would have been to proceed
with DA3
and, having given that answer, he was asked why, if he was assured of the
validity of DA1, he would not have made the DA3
application but would have made
the DA2 application, to which he asked "The DA2 or the 102(2)".  The evidence
continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. No, my question stands.  Can you give any reason why, if you had been
assured of the validity of DA1 ...</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. ..  You would not have made a DA3 application but you would have made a
DA2 application?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I might have made a DA2 application if I was - at that time there was no
invalidity and there was no challenge ..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You've said you would already, twice?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b><u>Q. So that's established that you would have done DA2 anyhow.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>A. Yes</u>."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

126   	This answer threw up another concession that DA2 would
have been pursued in any event.  In my opinion, Dr Quek's evidence
is
overwhelming that he would have pursued DA2 in any event in April 1996, and
that that would not have been done as part of a two-pronged
attack with 102(2).
When one reviews the whole of his evidence there is nothing inherently
improbable about this.
<P>

127   	Firstly, his evidence satisfies me that he did not want
to build in accordance with DA1 and did not intend to do so.  Secondly,
he was
aware that any development after the granting of DA1 was dependent on his
getting further approvals from the Council.  Thirdly,
his consistent evidence
was that he would have lodged DA2 in any event and irrespective of the legal
challenge to DA1 and, I am satisfied,
he would have done so and that that would
not have been done in tandem with 102(2).  Fourthly, 102(2) was lodged soon
after the conference
with Mr Tobias and the receipt of advice that it was
necessary to ascertain whether DA1 could have been built.  In all these
circumstances,
and the conclusions to which I have come are supported by
further evidence to which I shall refer, I do not consider that the plaintiff
would have lodged 102(2) before it in fact did, but I consider that before
doing so it would have pursued DA2, as it did.  Accordingly,
the plaintiff's
primary case must fail.
<P>

128   	Mr Tobias submitted, Tpp.586-7, that there would have
been nothing inconsistent in accepting that Dr Quek would have lodged
102(2),
if there had been no challenge, even if it be found that he would also have
lodged DA2 at the same time. However, the evidence
of Dr Quek satisfies me that
he would not have done this, but that he would have lodged DA2 in
February/March 1996.  It also satisfies
me that he would not have lodged 102(2)
until he in fact did.  The basic reason for this was, I am satisfied, that he
did not wish
to proceed with DA1.  Mr Tobias made the submission, which I do
not accept, that Dr Quek was not challenged on his evidence that
he would have
proceeded with 102(2) in March/April 1996.  An essential thrust of the
cross-examination was the chronology which would
have been followed in the
hypothetical circumstance and it was clearly in issue at an evidentiary level,
how Dr Quek would have proceeded.
<P>

129   	Mr Tobias submitted that DA1 was always the scheme Dr
Quek sought to pursue, and it is that upon which he would have fallen
back but
for the legal challenge.  I do not accept this.  In my opinion, Dr Quek made it
plain that this is not what he wanted to
do.
<P>

130   	Mr Tobias conceded that the evidence as to whether Dr
Quek would have lodged DA2 in any event was "conflicting": Tp.602.
 He said he
accepted "as one must, the evidence from Dr Quek upon which reliance is
placed".  He submitted that it was open to me
to conclude that DA2 would not
have been lodged, and continued:-
<P>

<b>"One has to always approach evidence in the witness box some three years
after the event as to a hypothetical of a person at the hands
of a skilled
cross-examiner with some equanimity."</b>
<P>

He submitted that the evidence had to be considered in all the circumstances,
which is, of course, correct.  However, the evidence
of Dr Quek was consistent
and firm.  It was given without any suggestion that he did not understand the
questions and, to the contrary,
I am satisfied that not only did he understand
them fully, but that he had a lively appreciation of the issues and the impact
of
his evidence on them.  Dr Quek was an astute and careful witness, who would
not, in my opinion and to my observation, have made an
incautious or unthinking
answer, let alone a concession.  Further the concessions were made on several
occasions and a couple of
days apart and they were consistent with the
probabilities.  For all these reasons I reject Mr Tobias' submissions that they
constituted
incautious and unthinking remarks on which I should place no
reliance, and that I should conclude that DA2 would not have been lodged.
<P>

131   	Mr Tobias accepted, as is obvious, that if I find, as I
do, that DA2 would have been lodged when it was in any event and
before 102(2),
and that 102(2) would have been lodged when it was, as I do, "then of course
the timing becomes somewhat different".
 So do the consequences.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Andrew David Darroch</b>
<P>

132   	Mr Darroch, whose witness statement was made on 16
October 1998 and is Exhibit A, was formerly an employee of the Council.
 He is
now the manager of a planning consultant and has experience as a town
planner.
<P>

133   	From December 1995 to July 1996 he was the Assessments
Manager of the Council and he considered, inter alia, applications
under s.102.
He set forth the procedures adopted when such an application was received,
including its allocation to the planning
officer who dealt with the original
application sought to be modified.  He said it would be likely that a
modification application
in relation to a significant development, such as the
plaintiff's, would have been drawn to his attention shortly after it was
received,
and that at that stage it was likely that he would only have been
made aware of the nature of the application, and perhaps made a
brief
preliminary assessment of the proposed modifications in conjunction with the
planning officer involved.  He stated that if
it looked as though the
modification application was totally unacceptable the usual practice was to
notify the applicant and give
it the opportunity to readdress the proposal
before notification and advertising.
<P>

134   	In paragraph 8 he said that assuming it was not decided
to refer the plans immediately back to the applicant, or perhaps
if the
applicant refused to accept any initial suggestion to readdress the
application, the planning officer, who was to deal with
it, being the
responsible officer, would refer the modification to the relevant departments
within the Council and, after receiving
comments from them, would assess it and
prepare a draft report to be forwarded to the Assessments Manager.  He, in that
position,
would read the report, look at the plans and comment where he thought
appropriate.  He would not consider it appropriate to carry
out checks of
specific matters, because they should have been considered by the responsible
officer, unless he observed an obvious
error, but he would look at the
interpretation and implementation of the requirements of the relevant planning
instruments by the
officers and, normally, endorse his comments on the report
in handwriting and then discuss them with the responsible officer.  If
he was
unable to obtain resolution with the responsible officer the matter would be
referred to the Council's Director of Planning
and Environmental Services.
<P>

135   	Mr Darroch would consider, firstly, whether s.102
modifications meant that the development, as modified, was substantially
the
same as that contemplated by the original approval: s.102(1)(a); and secondly
whether the modifications would cause prejudice
to any of the objectors:
s.102(1)(b).
<P>

136   	For the purpose of making his witness statement he looked
at a number of documents referred to in Annexure "ADD2".  He said
he had no
recollection of an involvement with the assessment or consideration of either
102(1) or 102(2).  He thought that if 102(1)
had been pursued, or if he was
still employed when 102(2) was made, it is likely he would have been involved
with the preparation
of the report to be submitted to the councillors in
relation to them.
<P>

137   	In paragraph 20 he said that had he been involved with
the assessment of 102(1) he believed he would have recommended refusal,
on the
basis that it would cause further prejudice to those who originally objected to
the proposal, and that it would adversely
affect the amenity of the surrounding
properties in terms of the heads of consideration under s.90.  He, therefore,
considered s.90
was a relevant consideration in determining 102(1), which makes
it difficult to see why it would not also have been relevant in looking
at
102(2).  In paragraph 21 he said 102(1) increased the bulk of the building in
various ways, which he described, such increase
being significant and affecting
views from the buildings to the north.  These concerns, he considered, caused
further prejudice to
previous objectors.  He noted several other matters which
had the same effect.  He concluded that 102(1) failed the test by causing
prejudice to the objectors and not satisfying certain heads of consideration
under s.90 of the Act.  As I have noted, it was not
in issue that 102(1) could
not have succeeded.
<P>

138   	Commencing with paragraph 29, he opined that if he had
been involved with the assessment of 102(2) he believed he would have
recommended it for approval.  He said the amended application "is considered to
be substantially the same as the previous approved
development application; it
would not cause further prejudice to the persons who originally objected to the
approved development
application and the amended proposal would not adversely
affect the amenity of the surrounding properties in terms of the heads of
consideration under s.90 of the Act".  Once again Mr Darroch had regard to s.90
considerations, although his view was that they should
be decided favourably to
the plaintiff.
<P>

139   	He expanded upon this by saying that 102(2) proposed
minor changes to the external envelope of the building, mostly concerned
with
reconfiguring the balconies on the north western corner, and resulted in a
decrease in building bulk.  He acknowledged there
were some changes to the
configuration at ground floor level, but said they did not adversely affect the
bulk scale of the building
and that the net resulting floor area "is minor".
He dealt with the car parking levels, and expressed the opinion that 102(2),
whilst
it increased the height of the plant room, decreased "the overall
footprint".  He thought the change to the height of the plant room
was minor
and satisfactory, and that 102(2) did not adversely affect the matters raised
in the objections to the approved development
application, namely views, bulk
and scale, shadowing, traffic and wind effect.  He concluded that he believed
102(2) "to be reasonable
and in my opinion would have been recommended for
approval if I had been involved in its assessment".  The plaintiff's basic
submission,
on this point, was that 102(2) would have gone forward with this
favourable recommendation and, in the circumstances, it would, in
all
probability, have been approved.  Those are a number of reasons why I do not
accept that these things would have happened.
<P>

140   	In a second statement, which Mr Darroch made in March
1999, he referred to certain timing issues raised by another town planner,
Mr
Sanders, who was called on behalf of the Council, and, commencing at paragraph
13, he set out a conversation he had with representatives
of the plaintiff in
February 1996 in relation to 102(1).   He said:-
<P>

<b>"I don't think the section 102 application can be supported in its current
form and will have to be reduced in scale."</b>
<P>

He recalled Dr Quek saying to either Mr Swalwell or Mr Ritchie, who apparently
worked for Mr Swalwell:-
<P>

<b>"You will need to look at the section 102 modification application to see
where it can be reduced."</b>
<P>

141   	At paragraph 14 he said he would have expected the
amended s.102 application to change the orientation of the balconies,
so that
they no longer faced the boundary, and to scale back the amendments that were
being asked for in 102(1).  He would also have
anticipated an amended s.102
application somewhere between 102(1) and what became the October 1996
application, during which time
he would have expected negotiations in relation
to 102(2) "with the outcome that an amended section 102 application, even if it
resulted
in a development somewhat larger than the development resulting from
the application as modified by the October 1996 section 102
application, would
have been recommended for approval".  He said consideration of 102(2) would
have been expedited and, in paragraph
17, that 102(2) "would definitely have
been acceptable".  In the context of his statement he was referring to
acceptability by him.
 This followed a sentence that it would have been
formally submitted by him to the Council.  On the basis of his recommendation
for
approval, he suggested that an amended s.102 application and building
application could have been approved by late April or early
May 1996, if
submitted separately, or earlier if the BA had been submitted with the amended
s.102 application.  In the concluding
paragraph Mr Darroch disagreed with Mr
Sanders' opinion that it would have taken until November 1997 before
construction could have
commenced.
<P>

142   	At Tp.30 Mr Darroch said that after the conversation in
February 1996 he did not have any involvement in preparing recommendations
or
taking any other step professionally concerning 102(1).  He agreed he was
familiar with DA2, but he could not recall how similar
DA2 was to a combination
of DA1 and 102(1).  He had no involvement with DA2 from the time of its
lodgment, or with 102(2) between
21 October 1996 and 16 December 1996, when
102(2) was rejected.
<P>

143   	He agreed, Tp.31, that the upshot, so far as he was
concerned, of his advice in the February meeting was that 102(1) was
doomed to
failure, and he expected that it would be amended.
<P>

144   	At Tp.33 Mr Darroch was challenged in relation to his
assessment of the fate of 102(2).  He agreed that his view as to what
would
have happened did not include any consideration by him of what was actually
discussed or decided by the Council in relation
to it and leading up to its
refusal on 16 December 1996, and that the Council itself is the decision-making
body subject to an appeal
to the Court.  He said he did not consider what
happened in Council because it was not available, in the sense that the minutes
do
not record in a sufficiently full format what transpired to understand what
was actually said at the meeting and why the councillors
came to the decision.
He agreed the result was recorded, that he was aware of the result, and that he
did not take it into account.
 This was a very strange view.  I would have
thought that if one wished to say that something would have been approved,
which was
refused, there was an obligation to state why he considered the
refusal was vitiated.  As Mr Darroch did not know the basis on which
the
application was refused, he could not comment.  He said he did not take it into
account because it was irrelevant so far as his
consideration of how he would
have recommended 102(2) to the Council.  None-the-less, he agreed that his
recommendation did not mean
that the councillors would approve, and that, in my
opinion, was a significant problem with his evidence on this point.  He
explained
the result, which he opined, in the following terms, Tp.34:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Do you understand your evidence to be directed only to what you would
have recommended and not to an outcome; is that what you
mean?</b>
<P>

<b>A. What my evidence - what I understand my evidence is to say is that - is
to give what I would have recommended in the matter and
I believe I said that
if - well, <u>it would have been in my experience, if the matter hadn't been
controversial or hadn't become controversial, that it was likely that
the
Council would have supported my recommendation</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. How close to what your hypothetical recommendation would have been was
the recommendation actually given by the Council officer
about s.102 number
2?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I think we were opposed.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Sorry?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I think we're totally opposed.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So that the actual recommendation given to the Council is utterly at odds
with the one you would have given; is that what you mean?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's right."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

The reference to the matter being controversial is not insignificant.  In my
opinion, the controversy had become more focussed by
late 1996 in consequence
of the failure of DA2.  However, there can be no doubt it existed in February
1996 when Mr Darroch advised
Dr Quek that there would have to be some reduction
in scale and bulk.  This was in the context of newly elected councillors, a
number
of whom had campaigned on the platform of reducing size and bulk.
<P>

145   	Mr Darroch advanced the view that that Council officer's
recommendation was, in his belief, affected by the validity or invalidity
at
law of DA1.  He expanded upon this by saying that he considered that the
opposition to the development and the legal challenge
influenced the decision
by the Council officer making the recommendation.  However, he disavowed any
suggestion that that Council
officer did anything "improper", and he agreed the
difference was "a professional difference", and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. It is a matter upon which opinions notoriously differ between planners
in relation to such matters as scale of development; is
that correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, there are professional differences.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Q. Is it a matter you have taken into account from time to time
when considering applications of this sort, namely, local
controversy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I've certainly taken local controversy into account.  I think it's an
important part of the process to understand and to take into
account and give
an appropriate weighting to the public opinion."</b>
<P>

Thus the "controversy" and public opinion would have played a part at the
Council decision making level.
<P>

146   	At Tp.37 Mr Darroch agreed that the councillors rejected
102(2) in accordance with the view presented to them, which was
a view upon
which there could be a professional difference, but in no way improper in
relation to a consideration of politics or
controversy.  This was important
evidence in light of the attack made by Mr Tobias that no councillor or Council
officer was called
to say how the decision was reached, such that I should, in
some way, draw a <b>Jones v Dunkel</b> inference.  I shall deal with this
later.  It was also important in answering Mr Tobias' submission that the
Council could not, by
an unreasonable exercise of discretion, deprive the
plaintiff of the consent it had.  Of course, the Council could not, but the
evidence
does not suggest that the exercise of discretion was, in any way,
improper or activated by improper motives.
<P>

147   	At Tp.38 Mr Darroch was asked to describe what
differences were required to be made to 102(1), which he agreed would not
have
succeeded, to bring about 102(2), which he considered would have succeeded.  He
said it was really necessary to look at an alternative
application, which was
somewhere between the extent of the two 102 applications, and then to make an
assessment in terms of its appropriateness:-
<P>

<b>"So, yes, I have given it consideration but, no, I haven't gone through all
of the alternatives available and considered whether what
is the impact of
those alternatives to say which would be appropriate and which wouldn't.
<u>It's really something for negotiation</u>." (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This was another piece of evidence with which I had difficulty, at least in
part.  Although Mr Darroch was prepared to assert that
102(2) would have been
approved, he apparently had no idea of that for which it would provide and, in
any event, as he made clear,
there would have to be negotiation.  Thus the
lodgment of 102(2) was but the first step so far as he was concerned.
Thereafter, the
parties would have been required to negotiate.
<P>

148   	Mr Darroch acknowledged, Tp.39, that any change to 102(1)
would have to be considered to make an assessment of its merits,
but none was
presented so that he did not do that exercise, and that he did not do any
hypothetical exercises "because there is a
myriad of possibilities".  He
continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. So where along a continuum of scale, bulk, floor space ratio or whatever
else, you might locate the change from failure to success
can't be known from
your evidence in this Court; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No - that's right.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And so there is nothing that can be done now to test any of that part of
your opinion against anything which actually happened;
is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's right."</b>
<P>

This evidence confirmed the remarks I have just made.  I have come to the firm
conclusion that Mr Darroch's evidence was so vague
that no reliance can be
placed on it as establishing that he would have recommended approval.  He
simply did not know what would
have been proffered, what would have been
acceptable to him, and what he would have achieved in the negotiation process.
The answer
to the first question had even more significance.  Mr Tobias
submitted that the changes to 102(1) would only have been minor in relation
to
certain balconies and some creep and other relevantly inconsequential matters.
He submitted that otherwise matters of scale and
bulk could not have been
changed without leading to a different development contrary to s.102(1).  Mr
Darroch was given every opportunity
by the first question quoted to make that
point, if it was a valid one.  He did not reject the premises in this question,
nor seek
to confine himself to the matters for which Mr Tobias contended.  His
answer was far more consistent with his more general statement
to Dr Quek
concerning bulk and size.
<P>

149   	At Tp.40 Mr Darroch agreed that the essential issue was
whether or not the building was too big, and that was not only a
major part of
the controversy but also at the heart of the professional planning issues.
This is consistent with his evidence to
which I have referred in paragraph 148
and the views I have formed based on it.  He agreed, therefore, that the
professional planning
issues were concerned with the matter of controversy.  He
added that a change of personnel in the planning department of the Council
was
a large part of the controversy to which he was referring.  The personnel
controversy arose because staff members left as a consequence
of this
application.  He said certain staff were dismissed because they were thought by
the Council to have been at fault in dealing
with DA1.
<P>

150   	At Tp.43 Mr Darroch confirmed that he was not suggesting
there was anything improper in the making of the recommendation
to the Council
by Mr Beattie, and he agreed, once again, that the planning issues involved
professional views upon which minds could
differ.
<P>

151   	He further agreed that the only negotiations he put
forward as likely to provoke the amendment of a s.102 application were
those
set forth in paragraph 13 of his second statement, and he recalled what Dr Quek
said to the architects.  He agreed that the
theory of timing about a second 102
application depended upon the developer responding in a timely fashion to
hints, perhaps heavy
hints, from Council officers, and that the hint he had
given was "a heavy hint", which, from his experience, normally provoked an
amendment from a developer wanting a consent to be modified.  He agreed the
reductions to which Dr Quek was referring were in bulk,
which he imagined, one
way or the other, would reduce the amount of saleable area available to the
market.  This is also consistent
with the evidence in paragraph 148.
<P>

152   	At Tp.46 Mr Darroch agreed that one of the reasons for
rejection of 102(2) was that it was not substantially the same development.
 He
disagreed with that assessment, but he said he did not suggest it was in any
way an improper basis, being a matter of professional
disagreement between him
and the Council officer, who made the recommendation, and, presumably, of
disagreement between him and the
councillors, who made the decision.
<P>

153   	In his statement of 7 March 1999 Mr Darroch, who had
referred to paragraph 1 of his previous statement, repeated that in
his opinion
it was likely that 102(2) would have been recommended for approval, and
continued:-
<P>

<b>"Further, in my opinion, assuming that the underlying consent was valid and
not the subject of legal challenge, Council would have
been most likely to
approve such an application."</b>
<P>

For the reasons I have given, I do not accept that Mr Darroch was in a position
to make such a statement.  Further, the plaintiff
has not satisfied me that the
Council would have come to that conclusion.
<P>

154   	Mr Darroch agreed that considerations of bulk would have
dominated the discussion on 16 December 1996.  This, in turn, in
my opinion,
would have raised s.90 considerations, with which, as I have noted, Mr Darroch
agreed.  No conceivable reason was advanced
why those reasons would not have
been equally applicable in February/March 1996.  Mr Darroch had referred to
them in his conversation
with Dr Quek and it is unthinkable that the
councillors would not have been concerned about them.
<P>

155   	Mr Darroch seemed to suggest, at one stage, that the
Council elected in September 1995 brought a different approach to the
development application.  That was probably correct, but he agreed, Tp.54, that
in his planning experience there is no expectation
that there will be no
difference between former and subsequent councils, and further that in February
1996 when he had his conversation
with Dr Quek and his architects it was known
that there were different councillors with different views, particularly in
relation
to the bulk and size of projects, such as that proposed by the
plaintiff.  Mr Darroch confirmed that, in his professional opinion,
102(1)
should not have been approved, and that he was not suggesting there was
anything improper about the influence of politics
in refusing 102(1), (although
it was withdrawn), nor in councillors or council officers called on to consider
s.90 matters taking
into account local views and feelings.  He agreed that
bearing in mind the controversy, the result of the election, and the
requirement
for a s.102 modification before a building application could be
issued, he would have expected the plaintiff, in February 1996, to
lodge a
s.102 modification with some prospect of success, which did not happen, and
further that nothing like that happened for a
very long time, which did not fit
his theory of people responding or being provoked by an appropriate "heavy
hint" to put in an amended
s.102 application to obtain approval.  He continued,
Tp.55:-
<P>

<b>"Q. You can't explain how it is that what you hypothesise is so much at odds
with what actually happened when Dr Quek was told by
you `reduce or you'll
fail'?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No, I can't explain that."</b>
<P>

In my opinion, this adds force to the conclusion that DA2 would have been
lodged in any event in an attempt to maximise the development,
and that there
was no intention to lodge 102(2) in March/April 1996 as there was no desire to
build conformably with DA1.
<P>

156   	It was then put to him that his theory that 102(2) would
have been approved by the Council was speculation without foundation,
and he
said that it was speculation of what he would have expected based on his
experience in dealing with applicants in such matters
and as an officer of the
Council.  In my opinion this evidence was effectively eroded by Mr Darroch's
agreement that he had never
come to a conclusion as to the type of s.102
application, which would be required, and that he considered that any such
application
would have been the subject of negotiation in any event.  Without
knowing the "bottom line" for his approval and whether the plaintiff
would have
agreed, one cannot say, as Mr Darroch sought to do, that he, let alone the
Council, would have approved.
<P>

157   	These problems confronting the plaintiff in relation to
102(2) were explained by Mr Darroch in the following terms:-
<P>

<b>"Because the planning process is not that precise.  It's a negotiation
process.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You haven't tried to work out what it is; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I haven't worked it out, no.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. As to 102 number 2, you can't say there's anything improper or
unreasonable about what actually happened to it, can you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I don't think there's anything improper, no.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You don't think there's anything unreasonable about what happened to the
102 number 2 in actual fact, do you?</b>
<P>

<b>A.  Well, in my professional opinion, I think the Council officer's
recommendation was unreasonable.  I don't agree with what he has
recommended."</b>
<P>

Ultimately Mr Darroch agreed that there was a difference of opinion on a matter
of judgment, but he disclaimed any suggestion that
the Council officer and an
outside consultant acted unreasonably in coming to a view different from his:
Tp.58.
<P>

158   	At Tp.59 Mr Darroch agreed, as was obvious, that the
development could have been reduced in size, and he said there was no
technical
difficulty in doing that, but that Dr Quek raised with him the matter of some
off-the-plan sales.  He also agreed that
a reduction to obtain a modification
could have been done very quickly within a matter of a few weeks.
<P>

159   	In re-examination Mr Darroch said that 102(1) was greater
in bulk than DA1, and that when he was suggesting a reduction in
scale he was
referring to the bulk of 102(1).  He meant by that, he said, the building bulk,
and the modification to which he was
referring was the reduction of the added
bulk, i.e. the bulk in 102(1) in excess of that in DA1.
<P>

160   	Mr Darroch concluded, Tp.61, by saying that he did not
think the recommendation by the Council officer was unreasonable,
in the sense
that "one is entitled to put that recommendation to the Council", but he did
not believe "it was a properly thought
out suggestion".  Earlier in his
evidence Mr Darroch had said that recommendations he had made to the Council
had not always been
accepted.
<P>

<b>The Effect Of Mr Darroch's Evidence</b>
<P>

161   	I do not consider that Mr Darroch's evidence assisted the
plaintiff.  He agreed, as was not in issue, that 102(1) could not
have been
approved, and that he suggested strongly to Dr Quek and his architects that
there would have to be a reduction in scale.
 He would have expected that a
developer, anxious to obtain consent, would have brought in an alternative
submission quickly, but
this did not happen.  He also said that s.90 matters
would have to be considered in evaluating 102(2).
<P>

162   	The plaintiff relied upon his evidence principally, as I
understood it, to support its case that he would have recommended
to the
Council that 102(2) be accepted, the inference, at least, being that the
Council would have adopted his recommendation.  I
do not consider that his
evidence leads to these conclusions, notwithstanding the apparently unequivocal
statements in his witness
statements.  These were significantly eroded in
cross-examination.
<P>

163   	Firstly, he was unaware of the reasons why the Council
refused 102(2) and, therefore, he did not pay any regard to their
reasons.  I
have commented on this failure.  He thought that if the matter had not been
controversial the Council would have supported
his recommendation.  He did not
suggest that the Council gave any improper emphasis to matters of politics or
controversy.  Secondly,
he conceded that the recommendation of the Council
officer against approval was not an improper one, although he ventured the view
that it had not been thought out properly.  He agreed that it reflected a
legitimate difference of professional views on which appropriate
minds could
differ.
<P>

164   	Thirdly, and very significantly in my view, Mr Darroch
had no clear concept of what would have been acceptable by way of
102(2).  He
had not done the exercise and, in any event, he regarded the final terms as a
matter for negotiation.  He did not accept
that the mere lodging of a further
submission seeking to accommodate the suggestions he had made would mean that
he would have recommended
approval.  That would have been the starting point
for negotiation, as the planning process "is not that precise".  I reiterate
that
without knowing what he would have regarded as acceptable, and the extent
to which Dr Quek would have made concessions in the negotiation
process, it
cannot be said that 102(2) would have been approved even by Mr Darroch.  It
remained speculation.
<P>

165   	In the end his evidence did not satisfy me that a town
planner acting reasonably, could not have recommended rejection; that
the
Council acting reasonably could not have taken into account the controversial
issues together with all the other matters they
were obliged to consider and
rejected 102(2); and that, in any event, he had any clear view as to what would
have been acceptable
for all the reasons I have stated.
<P>

166   	When all these matters are taken into account there was
no evidentiary basis left to support any of the positive assertions
Mr Darroch
put forward in chief.  The matter could only be viewed as one which, after the
submission of a further application, would
have to be worked out through
negotiation at the end of which and, of course depending on the extent that the
parties were prepared
to give way, there could be a legitimate difference of
professional town planning opinion.  Finally, the failure by Mr Darroch to
work
through what he would have regarded as acceptable made it somewhat rash for him
to be suggesting, when taken with the matters
to which I have referred, that he
would have recommended approval.  Mr Walker also submitted alternatively that
if 102(2) had been
lodged in March/April 1996, contrary to his primary
submission, that that would have occurred when DA2 was lodged, i.e. on 4 April
1996, and that as Mr Darroch acknowledged he had nothing to do with the
applications from that date, he would not have made any recommendation
in
relation to 102(2) in any event.  I consider this alternative submission is
correct, but as I am not satisfied that 102(2) would
have been lodged at that
time it is only necessary to note it.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr David Reuben Epstein</b>
<P>

167   	Mr Epstein made a statement on 16 October 1998, Exhibit
C.  He was formerly an officer in the town planning section of the
Council and
recalled 102(1) being received by it in December 1995.  He said that given his
awareness of the history of the matter
it is quite likely that had it been
necessary to deal with 102(1), he would have been responsible for preparing the
initial report
which, after discussion with the Assessments Manager, would have
been provided to the Council for consideration.  However, he did
not recall
what became of 102(1) and his examination of documents indicated it was not
pursued.
<P>

168   	He also noted from the file that 102(2) was submitted,
but by that time he had left the Council's employment.  He continued
that had
he not left, it is possible, given his previous involvement, that he would have
had an involvement in preparing the report
for submission to the Council in
relation to that application.
<P>

169   	In paragraph 10 he said that he had been asked recently
to consider the s.102 amendment applications, i.e. 102(1) and 102(2),
and
provide his opinion whether it is likely, given the criteria for approval for
s.102 amendment applications, which he understood
to be relevant and applicable
at that time, that he would have recommended that the applications be
approved.
<P>

170   	In relation to 102(1) he said that it sought to increase
the bulk and scale of the development in various ways he specified,
and
concluded that the development as proposed to be so modified was not
substantially the same.  He was also of the opinion that
the development would
prejudice the objectors to DA1.
<P>

171   	In relation to 102(2), he opined that this application
generally brought the plan of the development into alignment with
the
development application plans as approved in February 1995.  His final view
was:-
<P>

<b>"Having regard to the matters for consideration under s.102 it is my opinion
that the development as modified by the second s.102
amendment is substantially
the same as the development as approved, and that no further prejudice would be
caused to any person who
objected to the development application the subject of
that consent."</b>
<P>

172   	Mr Epstein conceded, in cross-examination, that he had
not read any of the expert evidence for or against the granting of
the
development consent in the Class I proceedings, and agreed that his assignment
did not include looking at that material notwithstanding
that 102(2) was
rejected.
<P>

173   	Although he said he had read certain of the material that
was before the Council before it reached its decision on 16 December
1996, and
was aware that there were opinions different from his, he came to his opinion
regardless of what  the Council had concluded
and of what the report before it
stated.  
<P>

174   	He agreed the report before the Council contained
professional views different from his and to which he paid no regard and,
further, that this is an area classically for the judgment of town planners.
He was asked whether he thought his judgment would be
assisted by looking at
that of others, to which he replied:-
<P>

<b>"I guess you could say that, yes."</b>
<P>

This, in my opinion, was a clear acceptance of the obvious.  A professional
person, expressing a view on a matter on which he agrees
that minds can
reasonably differ, places himself in an impossible position by not considering
those views and how, in reaching a
contrary conclusion, he can explain why the
contrary views are not appropriate.
<P>

175   	He conceded that the fact that persons came to judgments
differing from his did not mean that they were acting unreasonably,
and he
repeated that he had paid no regard to the views which differed from his.
Finally, he agreed that his report did not contain
any consideration of the
requirements of s.90, but he did not suggest that they were irrelevant. In
re-examination Mr Epstein said
that he would have given consideration to s.90
matters, which reinforced his view as to their relevance and was consistent
with the
evidence of Mr Darroch and Mr Sanders.  These views are inconsistent
with the fundamental approach taken by the plaintiff to the
application of s.90
in these circumstances, but consonant with what I consider was the view flowing
from the Court's decisions at
that time.
<P>

176   	His evidence, if I may say so with no disrespect to him,
carried the matter no further so far as the plaintiff was concerned,
and merely
confirmed the point being made by Mr Walker that in this area various planners
could legitimately come to different opinions.
 If I may say so, I find it
extraordinary that Mr Epstein would venture an opinion without having regard to
that of others.  Additionally,
his evidence did not assist the plaintiff in
relation to the applicability of s.90 considerations.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Terence Paul Byrnes</b>
<P>

177   	Mr Byrnes, whose witness statement was prepared in
November 1998 and became Exhibit D, has extensive experience in architecture,
planning and urban design.  He stated that he had been instructed to consider
and assess "the circumstances of" DA1, and the likelihood
of 102(2) being
approved.
<P>

178   	In relation to DA1 he concluded, at paragraph 3.11:-
<P>

<b>".. it follows that the development application 1082/94, the subject of the
consent, was not capable of being built according to the
relevant building
codes and requirements without further amendment, via a section 102 Application
or a building application."</b>
<P>

179   	In Section 4 of his report he turned to 102(2).  After a
lengthy consideration of the plans he considered whether the development
was
substantially the same as approved in DA1 and, at paragraph 40.93,
concluded:-
<P>

<b>"That the development as proposed to be modified is `substantially the same
development' and therefore passes the first threshold
test under s.102 of the
Act."</b>
<P>

180   	Mr Byrnes nextly considered whether there was any
prejudice to those persons who originally objected to the application and,
after detailing many matters, he said, in paragraph 4.107:-
<P>

<b>"In summary, it is concluded from the analysis of any prejudicial change,
the original application as proposed to be modified would
not prejudice any
person who originally objected, and section 102 application (two) passes the
second threshold test."</b>
<P>

181   	The next matter Mr Byrnes addressed was the s.90
assessment.  His view was that there was nothing there which, in his opinion,
would have prevented approval of 102(2).  His position in regard to s.90
matters is set forth in a letter written by Mr Sanders,
to which I shall refer.
His ultimate conclusion, in paragraph 4.115, was:-
<P>

<b>".. that the section 102 application as submitted to Council was capable of
assessment as a section 102 application and worthy of
support and a
consent."</b>
<P>

182   	Mr Byrnes then considered the Council's assessment of
102(2) and, in paragraph 4.135, expressed the view, consistently with
the view
to which he had come as to its acceptability, that "the conclusions reached by
the Council officers and the Council are
not supported".
<P>

183   	In Section 5 of his report he considered and assessed
building application 95/275 and he dealt with 102(1) in Section 6,
expressing
the conclusion that it revealed:-
<P>

<b>".. that the modified development is substantially the same development,
albeit at the margin, and that the modifications are unlikely
to cause
prejudice to any person who objected to the original Application."</b>
<P>

184   	In this respect he was at variance with all other
witnesses and with the common ground on which the case proceeded.
<P>

185   	In Section 7 he said:-
<P>

<b>"The most obvious  conclusion reached when considering the merits of the two
Section 102 Applications, is that Section 102(Two) was
more comfortably able to
satisfy the `tests', while Section 102(One) approached the limits of what would
be an acceptable Section
102 Application modification application."</b>
<P>

186   	Mr Byrnes had consulted with the defendant's expert, Mr
H.M. Sanders, and he was shown a letter, which became Exhibit 6.
 It was signed
by Mr Sanders and headed "Summary of Matters Discussed With T.P. Byrnes
8/3/99".  He said he thought it was a fair
summation in all respects, it
stating:-
<P>

<b>"Section 102(2) compared with DA.</b>
<P>

<b>We agreed that the overlays which had been prepared to compare Section
102(2) with DA1 were correct.</b>
<P>

<b>We agreed that the differences between Section 102(2) and DA1 were as listed
in the tabulation which accompanied my draft letter to
Mallesons Stephen Jaques
dated 15 November 1996 (see Annexure 5 to my February statement) and that the
differences as described were
consistent with Mr Byrnes' description of them in
his Statement dated November 1998.</b>
<P>

<b>However, we did not agree on the inferences which one might draw from the
agreed description of the differences.</b>
<P>

<b>Section 102(2) Compared With DA2.</b>
<P>

<b>We agreed that the overlays were a correct depiction of the two
applications.  </b>
<P>

<b>However, we did not agree as to whether Section 102(2) and DA2 were the
same, or sufficiently similar, for the purposes of considering
and comparing
the impact of the two buildings.  Mr Byrnes did not therefore agree with the
conclusion I had reached regarding the
likely outcome of an appeal in respect
of Section 102(2).</b>
<P>

<b>Section 102(2) And The BA.</b>
<P>

<b>We agreed that even if Section 102(2) had been approved it would still have
been necessary to amend the BA.</b>
<P>

<b>Other Matters</b>
<P>

<b>We agreed that Section 102(1) was not a valid Section 102
application.</b>
<P>

<b>We agreed that the remaining points where we differed, in addition to those
noted above were:</b>
<P>

<b>	The timing of the processing of the various applications;</b>
<P>

<b>	The interpretation of the words `strictly in accordance with' in Condition
1 of DA11;</b>
<P>

<b>	Whether any prejudice would have been caused to an objector to DA1 by
Section 102(2);</b>
<P>

<b>	Whether Section 90(1) considerations in respect of a Section 102
application should relate to the differences between the da [DA]
and the s102
application or to the overall building as proposed to be modified; and</b>
<P>

<b>	Whether or not DA1 and Section 102(2) were substantially the same.</b>
<P>

<b>I have not had the opportunity discuss this document with Mr Byrnes or to
show him a draft.  He may wish to consider how best to obtain
this
information.</b>
<P>

<b>I expect to hear from Mr Ingham regarding the one matter which we discussed,
namely the description of the differences between Section
102(2) and
DA1.</b>
<P>

<b>1 In view of our agreement that the BA would need to be amended even if
Section 102(2) had been approved, this may not be an issue
- see page 11 of my
Statement."</b>
<P>

187   	At Tp.169 Mr Byrnes said that he gave evidence before
Talbot J as a forensic expert in support of the appeal in relation
to DA2,
which included an overall assessment so far as an expert can and should do it
of what were then called the s.90 matters.
 He agreed that as a matter of its
own character in terms of planning history, at the heart of a s.90 assessment
of the project at
the time it took the DA2 form were questions of bulk and
scale, and that his support for DA2 in the Court was based upon his opinion
that on the merits it should receive consent.  He also agreed that others gave
evidence, which disagreed with his, and that Talbot
J preferred the other
evidence.  He agreed enthusiastically, Tp.170, that this is an area where
experts form opinions, give evidence
to explain and support them, and, at the
end of the day, a decision is reached.  In the Court differing opinions were
expressed from
the same disciplines as those in which he is skilled, which
reached a contrary conclusion, and he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And for those reasons, in light of all your experience in your
professional area and from your forensic appearances in particular,
you accept
that conclusions different from yours are reasonably open by people skilled or
who have had the benefit of hearing skilled
evidence in this area; is that
right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I do."</b>
<P>

188   	At Tp.171 Mr Byrnes was asked whether he had given
consideration to the report of Mr Beattie, the Council officer who made
the
recommendation, in relation to 102(2).  He said it was available to him, but he
did not refer to it expressly or impliedly in
his report, although he was
obviously aware that he was at odds with the recommendations and Council's
reasons for refusal.  However,
he readily conceded that he had Mr Beattie's
opinions, and that he took them into account in preparing his and reached a
different
conclusion, and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And that, I suggest to you, is as ordinary an occurrence as it was for
the Judge to differ from you or the witnesses called on
the other side in DA2
to differ from you; is that correct?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's right."</b>
<P>

189   	In re-examination Mr Byrnes set out the various witnesses
for the competing views called before Talbot J on the hearing of
the DA2
appeal.  He agreed that there was a body of respectable opinion for both sides.

<P>

190   	Mr Byrnes' evidence left the matter on the basis that
whether 102(2) should or should not have been recommended for approval
by the
Council's officers was a matter for their professional opinion, as to which
there could be legitimate differences.  Whilst
he did not agree with the
Council officers' opinion, he did not criticise it save as differing from his
view on a matter where different
views were permissible.  Thus his evidence was
supportive of the view that the councillors, in reaching their conclusion to
reject
the application, could not be said to have been acting in an improper,
capricious or arbitrary manner.  Rather, the conclusion to
which they came was
properly open on the material before them.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Neil Ingham</b>
<P>

191   	Mr Ingham, who is an expert town planner, and whose
witness statement became Exhibit E, stated that he had been requested
to
provide an opinion regarding 102(1) and (2).  He expressed the view that 102(1)
"was not able to be approved under the provisions
of s.102", and that 102(2)
should have been approved under that section.  It is unnecessary to deal with
his consideration of 102(1).
 In relation to 102(2) he said that he attempted
to note the main differences between the consent plans and the plans submitted
with
it in tabular form and, having done so, he stated that the majority of the
amendments "had generally been undertaken in order to
address conditions of the
development consent or requirements of the BCA".  Although he discerned some
differences, he considered
they were minor and he said:-
<P>

<b>"The above changes result in some minor differences to the bulk and scale to
the building shown on the consent plans, mainly in regard
to the roof top plant
room.</b>
<P>

<b>In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the Second Section 102
application does detail a development which is `substantially
the same' as that
which is detailed on the consent plans (as amended by the conditions of the
consent)."</b>
<P>

192   	He also considered the requirements of s.102(1)(b) and
concluded that the plans submitted with 102(2) "would not prejudice
the
objectors to the original DA".  He did not give any consideration to s.90
matters.
<P>

193   	In his oral evidence in chief Mr Tobias raised the
absence of any reference to s.90 considerations.  Mr Ingham explained
this by
saying that the changes to the application were improvements and did not bring
about, in his opinion, any need for further
consideration of that section.  He
said it was his understanding that s.102(3A) applied to the changes that were
being made, and
that if there were substantial changes one would give
consideration to s.90 implications, but if there were not, one only looked
at
the changes and the import of s.90 in relation to them.  He did not regard the
proposed changes as raising a s.90 issue.  This
made clear, as had the
plaintiff's other evidence, that s.90 considerations could be relevant,
although it was his view, in the circumstances
of this case, that they were
not.
<P>

194   	In cross-examination he said that in expressing those
views he was not presuming to give a legal opinion.  He was aware that
there
was potentially a change in the law brought about by the decision in <b>Michael
Standley</b>,<b> </b>but he said that he had formed his opinion about what the
Council should have done on what he understood to have been the regime before
that decision.  He said, Tp.176, that he agreed that as at mid-December 1996,
to the extent that the application sought to modify
DA1 s.90 had to be applied,
but he did not think that s.90 considerations could be regarded as having no
role only if the modification
had no impact on any aspect of DA1.  He continued
that if it had no significant impact, then he would say that.  He did not
recall
Stein JA's dissenting reasons on this point in <b>Michael Standley</b>
and, generally speaking, he was not aware of certain specific Court decisions,
although his understanding in relation to the operation
of s.90 came, he said,
from lodging s.102 applications and from arguing matters in the Court.
<P>

195   	Mr Ingham agreed that the questions of "substantially the
same development" and "prejudice to any objector" were threshold
matters,
although he said that a determination of them frequently resolved the issue.
He also agreed that merit matters may arise.

<P>

196   	At Tp.183 he said that it was probably true that the
project produced by 102(2) would have been much closer to DA2 than to
DA4.  He
was also of the view that 102(2) "is much closer to DA1 than it would be to
DA4": Tp.184.  In my opinion, this evidence
was significant in supporting the
submission of Mr Walker that there was a "family similarity" between DA1, DA2
and 102(2).  This
evidence was also of importance in considering the way in
which the Council was likely to view 102(2).  If there was such a similarity
there was less likelihood that the Council would approve 102(2), if it had
already subjected DA1 to stringent conditions and rejected
DA2.  He did not
know sufficient about DA3 to comment on it.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Putting it all together then, including what follows from your last
answer, doesn't it mean that in your opinion section 102 number
2 is much
closer to two developments both of which failed before Council and Court than
it is to the one development DA4 which now
has consent?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's correct.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And what that indicates to you, amongst other things, is that your
opinion is one with which reasonable minds can reasonably differ
so as to reach
the opposite conclusion; do you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, I am simply going on my experience of the use of section 102 when -
and applying experience to those applications and in
my opinion from that
experience the first section 102 would have failed and the second 102 would
have been approved, or should have
been approved.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. What about an answer to my question?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, other people can say what they like.  I'm simply saying what I
believe from my experience.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. I understand that.  When you say `other people can say what they like',
do you accept that what has happened in this case demonstrates
that other
people have said differently from you, have come to the opposite conclusion
about whether approval should be granted and
you're not able to say that they
are therefore unreasonable people; do you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, I agree that other experts have come to a different view about some
of the matters that I've raised."</b>
<P>

197   	Mr Ingham said that he did not consider the views of
Talbot J in relation to DA2 and DA3 because he did not believe they
were
relevant to the issue before him, and he expressed the view that there would be
"a fairly strong likelihood" that an appeal
from the refusal of 102(2) would
have led to approval.
<P>

198   	Mr Ingham's evidence reinforced what, by then, was almost
common ground, viz that 102(2) was a matter on which the opinions
of town
planners and those with allied expertise, acting reasonably, could legitimately
differ.  It emphasised that 102(2) was "closer"
to the two developments, which
failed before the Council and the Court, than to DA4.  Of course it is known
that the Council refused
102(2) and that the appeal against that refusal would
have been heard by Talbot J, who rejected DA2 and DA3, but for his Honour's
decision on the Class IV application.  The plaintiff must, therefore, satisfy
me that in the presence of conflicting evidence about
102(2), which depicted an
approval closer to DA2 and DA3, than to DA4, Talbot J would have allowed the
appeal in relation to 102(2).
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Andrew Andersons</b>
<P>

199   	The witness statement of Mr Andersons dated 8 March 1999
became Exhibit F.  He is an architect and a principal director of
Peddle Thorp
&amp; Walker, and before receiving a commission on 10 October 1996 he had a
meeting with Dr Quek, who asked him to come
up with a new design for the
site:-
<P>

<b>".. that is capable of being approved by North Sydney Council and addresses
the various criticisms made of DA2 by the Land and Environment
Court.  Here is
a copy of that judgment for you to look at.  I would like to maintain as much
development potential as possible but
I realise that there may have to be some
reduction necessary to achieve approval."</b>
<P>

Thus, in October 1996, Dr Quek was instructing his architect to compromise on
size as little as possible, so that the plaintiff
could have the maximum number
of units notwithstanding that he understood that there "may" have to be some
reduction to achieve approval.
 He was not suggesting that 102(2) should be
lodged, but was following the development application route with the request
that as
much saleable area as possible be retained.  This approach was
inconsistent with the use of DA1 as the vehicle through which development
should take place.
<P>

200   	Mr Andersons said that before accepting the commission he
wanted to study the plans, which were the subject of the application
that was
rejected by the Court, and the judgment to determine whether he could do what
the planning and urban designs required within
the parameters of his
instructions.  He said he would not have accepted the commission if he did not
think he could produce a design
"with a realistic chance of approval that met
the criteria specified".  He explained the steps he took to try to achieve that
and,
on 16 December 1996, DA3 was submitted.  Up to that time Mr Andersons was
confident that the scheme would be approved, although he
became less confident
in the light of certain statements made by some councillors.
<P>

201   	In cross-examination Mr Andersons said it was made clear
to him at a meeting on 16 October 1996 with representatives of the
Council that
the height of the project was a major concern, and  he agreed that a minute
prepared by Peddle Thorp &amp; Walker of
the meeting stated that he was told
there must be a reduction in height.
<P>

202   	He agreed that by 18 October 1996 the position was that
the plaintiff required 17,000 square metres of net saleable area
to be
maintained as part of the design brief, and the number of apartments and their
type to be maintained as much as possible.
<P>

203   	At Tp.223 Mr Andersons said that he had read the judgment
in relation to the appeal against the rejection of DA2 and he agreed
that the
previous scheme "was massive and monolithic" such that "the general monolithic
mass of the building should be reduced".
 This was a somewhat damning
condemnation of what the plaintiff proposed and supportive of the view of
councillors, concerned about
over-development, that DA2 should have been
rejected and, inferentially, that 102(2), because of its similarity, should
suffer the
same fate. Mr Andersons agreed that the maintenance of 17,000 square
metres of net saleable area and a reduction of scale was quite
a challenge,
which involved investigation, balance and skill, and that by 22 October 1996
Peddle Thorp &amp; Walker had formed the
view that there had to be a
significantly different building, and that if there was not "it would likely
fall foul of similar problems
as the one which had been rejected by Council and
Court": Tp.224.  Mr Andersons did not express the view that the Council or the
Court in refusing the applications already made had not been acting reasonably.
Rather his description of the proposed building would
tend to indicate that
they were.
<P>

204   	Mr Andersons was referred to a minute of a meeting on 22
October 1996, which became Exhibit 10, and which stated that Peddle
Thorp &amp;
Walker identified four issues to which the new proposal had to have regard as
being the need for a significantly different
building, no less unit numbers,
amenity of apartments to be improved, and perhaps the providing of more units
with smaller area.
 He said that that was a fair summary of Peddle Thorp &amp;
Walker's position.
<P>

205   	He continued that as at October 1996 Peddle Thorp &amp;
Walker saw the challenge as being to reduce monolithic bulk, but
to maintain
either saleable area or saleable apartments, a statement of those objectives
indicating the degree of challenge.  He
agreed that the minutes of the meeting
of 15 October 1996, Exhibit 8, made it clear that height must be reduced, with
which he concurred.
 Mr Andersons was shown a document of 13 November 1996,
which was prepared by Peddle Thorp &amp; Walker's project architect, which
said
that "Cliff Street" must reduce in height, and at the outset noted that the
bulk needed reducing.
<P>

206   	On 14 November 1996 Mr Andersons wrote to Greencliff
setting forth various problems.  A post script to the letter stated:-
<P>

<b>"As you are aware, height is a contentious issue on this project and it is
essential we have more and correct information regarding
neighbouring
structures."</b>
<P>

207   	Mr Andersons agreed that the letter was saying that
Peddle Thorp &amp; Walker's task would be easier if the plaintiff was
prepared
"to wear further reduction in this area".
<P>

208   	At Tp.229 Mr Andersons was asked whether there were
reductions in the scale and bulk of the plan being put forward by Peddle
Thorp
&amp; Walker after 14 November 1996.  He said he could not remember
specifically, but if there were they would have been "fairly
minor".  He
continued "in general terms it proceeded on that basis".  Mr Andersons said
that by February 1997 he was seeking to persuade
the plaintiff to reduce the
height, but that that was causing difficulties to the plaintiff,
notwithstanding his professional opinion
that it should reduce the height more
than it was appearing to do.
<P>

209   	A position had thus arisen in which Mr Andersons was
trying to persuade Dr Quek to reduce the height of the building, which
Dr Quek
was resisting.  He said that his feeling at the end of the process was that
generally the scheme propounded by Peddle Thorp
&amp; Walker would probably be
approved subject to some reduction in the height, although he agreed that if
that was not a condition
the Council would reject the scheme and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. That was a risk that you understood ...</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. The developer represented by Dr Quek was prepared to take?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Notwithstanding your advice about the risks; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

210   	Mr Andersons' evidence made it clear that Dr Quek was not
prepared to give up very much as at late 1996.  Notwithstanding
Mr Andersons'
advice, Dr Quek was maintaining that stance, which involved his trying to
obtain a building Mr Andersons described
as "massive and monolithic".  Any
changes were "fairly minor" and such that there was a risk, which he understood
the plaintiff was
prepared to run, that the Council would reject the scheme.
Thus, even after the rejection of DA2, the plaintiff was still prepared
to run
the risk of rejection to achieve as many units as possible.  There is no reason
to think that in the hypothetical situation
it would not have adopted the same
strategy.
<P>

211   	This attitude casts further grave doubts on the fate of
102(2), whether one accepted the hypothesis that the plaintiff had
submitted it
in late March/early April 1996 or the fact that it was lodged in October 1996.
Mr Darroch made clear that had 102(2)
been submitted in March/April 1996, it
would not have been accepted without more but would have been the subject of
negotiation.
 The attitude Dr Quek was likely to have taken to negotiations is
manifested by his apparent refusal to accept Mr Darroch's heavy
hint, and his
unwillingness to accept Mr Andersons' advice.  As Mr Ingham thought that the
proposal it contained was closer to DA2
and DA3, (the latter of which Mr
Andersons agreed only brought about "fairly minor" reductions in scale and
subjected the plaintiff
to the risk that the Council would reject it), the
conclusion that 102(2) would not have been approved by the Council, if lodged
in March/April 1996, is difficult to escape.  Dr Quek had agreed the relevant
changes were "minimal".  Further, the prospect of the
same Judge, who had
rejected DA2 and DA3, accepting 102(2) in the form for which the plaintiff was
insisting, seems unlikely in the
absence of any meaningful changes.  However,
it is not necessary for me to reach that latter conclusion because, as Mr
Tobias agreed,
the onus is on the plaintiff to established that Talbot J would,
as a matter of probability, have approved it.  However, Mr Tobias
invited me to
compare certain material relevant to the differences in what was proposed in
102(2) and to come to my own conclusion
as to which body of expert opinion
should have been accepted.  I do not intend to follow this course.  Firstly, as
I have said, there
was an abundance of evidence that on this topic different
minds, expert in the relevant field, could come to conflicting opinions.
 If
the matter was for my determination I would have to decide which evidence I
preferred and, in coming to that decision, to have
regard to the evidence from
which the experts drew their conclusions.  Secondly, the matter is not one for
my decision.  It was expressly
agreed that the issue I had to decide was
whether, if the Court had considered 102(2), the plaintiff has satisfied me, on
the balance
of probabilities, that the Court would have allowed the appeal.
That being the matter for my decision it is not helpful for me to
intrude my
own view in a field where experts can legitimately differ.
<P>

212   	But at this point it is necessary to keep carefully in
mind the distinction between the requirements for a DA approval and
those for a
s.102 approval.  In the former case all matters, including the s.90
considerations, must be taken into account.  In the
latter the appellant must
pass the two relevant threshold tests, and the question then arises as to the
extent to which the Court
at that time, and unaided by the decision in
<b>Michael Standley</b>, would have approached the s.90 matters.  As I have
pointed out, it did not seem to be in issue that s.90 matters would have to be
considered, the real question being the extent to which they were applicable,
if at all, to the modifications and amendments proposed
to 102(2).
<P>

213   	The view taken by the Court prior to <b>Michael
Standley</b> was expressed by Stein JA in <b>Michael Standley</b>.  His Honour,
at p.482, noted that s.102(3A) was inserted in 1992 following earlier decisions
of the Court to the effect that relevant
s.90 considerations had to be taken
into account when determining modifications.  His Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"The amendment confirmed this approach and was passed, as I understand it,
for more abundant caution and to make plain to decision-makers
their
responsibility in assessing such applications."</b>
<P>

214   	His Honour dissented from the majority view that the
section directed the decision-maker to consider any s.90 matter relevant
to the
whole development as modified, and re-affirmed the view he had expressed, as a
Judge of the Court, that the s.90 heads of
consideration were those "of
relevance to the subject of the modification application".  His Honour
crystallised his views thus:-
<P>

<b>"It is clear that s.102(3A) requires the decision-maker to address the s.90
heads of consideration <u>relevant to the modification application</u>.  That
is the application before the consent authority.  To the extent that the
application seeks to modify the previously approved
development, s.90 must be
applied.  <u>But when the modification has no impact on any aspect of the
already approved development, s.90 considerations have no role to play</u>."
(My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

After further consideration, his Honour said, p.483, that the correct approach
to s.102(3A) "is to assess the impact and effect
of the modification on that
already approved and take into account any s.90 considerations relevant to that
effect or impact".  This
indicates quite clearly that when the modification is
concerned with objectionable bulk and size, the s.90 considerations appropriate
to bulk and size should be considered when reviewing the modification.
<P>

215   	I shall assume that his Honour's views reflected the
approach which would have been taken by a Judge of the Court before
<b>Michael
Standley</b>.  Mr Tobias' submission was that this was so, but that that
approach would not have caused a re-visiting of any s.90 matters.  The
modifications were concerned with bulk and scale and the overall appearance and
effect of the proposed building.  That type of modification
must have impacted
on what had already been approved and, therefore, raised for consideration s.90
matters relevant thereto.  There
was a body of evidence, which supported this
view.
<P>

216   	Section 90 considerations include the impact of the
development on the environment; the effect of the development on the
landscape
or scenic quality of the locality; the character, location, siting, bulk,
shape, size, height, density, design or external
appearance of the development;
the area to be occupied by the development; the relationship of the development
to adjoining land
and other land in the locality; and the existing and likely
future amenity of the neighbourhood.  In my opinion these matters would
have
been relevant to the modification application.  Certain of them were central to
it and the problems this development had encountered.
 The Court in my view
must have had regard to them, even on the basis of its own then decisions.
<P>

217   	In these circumstances I cannot be satisfied that if the
s.90 considerations had been taken into account as, in my view they
had to be,
102(2) would have been approved by the Court on appeal.
<P>

<b>A Substantial Attack On The Council's Defence</b>
<P>

218   	In response to the plaintiff's contention that the
Council would have approved 102(2), Mr Walker pointed to the fact that
it had
not.  
<P>

219   	When the councillors considered 102(2) they had before
them a recommendation that the plans and documents submitted to amend
DA1 did
not represent a modification, which could be approved under s.102 because the
proposed development was not substantially
the same, and because the proposal
increased prejudice to persons, who previously objected, by impacting adversely
on the streetscape.
 The recommendation was signed by Mr Beattie, the Acting
Assessments Manager, and endorsed by Mr Ryan, the Director of Planning and
Environmental Services.  The report was quite detailed and at page 6 identified
the two matters under s.102 to which reference was
made in the recommendation,
and continued:-
<P>

<b>"In addition, Section 102(A) (sic) also requires the consent authority to
take into consideration such matters referred to in Section
90 which were
relevant to the application."</b>
<P>

It then addressed the issues and said, inter alia, that the proposed amendments
raised "no further significant issues under the
provisions of Section 90
........ other than those issue (sic) raised by the original application".  The
concluding paragraph referred
to the matters on the front page of the report
and recommended rejection.  The councillors resolved that the report be
adopted.
<P>

220   	Mr Tobias submitted that the report merely "parrotted"
the draft report of Mr Sanders, an independent expert retained by
the Council.
An analysis of both reports demands that this submission be rejected.  Mr
Tobias nextly submitted that the Council officers
had not been called to
explain the report.  The report speaks for itself and, whilst it was subject to
some criticism and disagreement,
it was not disputed that it was a report
evidencing a conclusion to which a town planner could properly come.
<P>

221   	Mr Tobias submitted that the officers had raised no s.90
considerations and, as the Council resolution only referred to an
adoption of
the report, the councillors had not given consideration to such matters.  I do
not agree with either of these submissions.
 The report referred to s.90
considerations and, on a fair reading of it, stated that there were still
significant s.90 issues, although
no "further" ones.  This was dealt with in
submissions at Tp.577.
<P>

222   	In my opinion, the s.90 issues were clearly left open for
consideration by the councillors.  Even if they were not, there
was nothing to
prevent the councillors from having regard to them.  Mr Tobias submitted that
the councillors should have been called
to explain how they reached these
conclusions.  I consider that the critical issue was the result at which they
arrived in circumstances
where the evidence established that this was a matter
on which minds could properly differ.  For reasons to which I shall now refer
I
do not consider that the failure to call either the Council officers or the
councillors leads to any adverse finding in relation
to the refusal.
<P>

223   	Mr Tobias submitted that I should not be satisfied by
that resolution because the Council had failed to call either the town
planners, who had made the recommendation to it, or the councillors to explain
why they had come to that decision and, so it was
submitted, in those
circumstances I should draw the <b>Jones v Dunkel</b> inference, (<b>Jones v
Dunkel &amp; Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298)</a>, and conclude that they could have
said nothing which assisted the Council's case. 
<P>

224   	Mr Walker submitted that in the absence of any evidence
that in reaching the decision either the Council had acted so unreasonably
that
its decision could not, on any view, be upheld, or it had reached the decision
by acting in dereliction of its duties and, thus,
perhaps in circumstances
which could be described as "corrupt", there was no reason why any officer or
councillor should have been
called.  The submission was that the <b>Jones v
Dunkel</b> inference only arises to support an inference for which there is an
independent evidentiary basis, which in the present case there
was not as there
existed a decision of the Council and, unless there was evidence to enable it
to be vitiated in one of the two ways
to which I have referred, which there was
not, the plaintiff could not attack it, at least collaterally in these
proceedings.  The
proper attack would have been by way of an appeal, which was
pursued but, because of other events, became otiose.
<P>

225   	This was not, however, a case where there was an absence
of relevant evidence in relation to the decision making process.
 The fact was
that there was uncontradicted evidence that professional opinions on these
points could differ properly, the conclusion
from which was that there was no
valid reason for attacking the Council's decision making process in
circumstances calling for some
explanation.
<P>

226   	The principle on which Mr Tobias relied does not, in my
respectful opinion, assist him. Kitto J stated it thus, at p.308:-
<P>

<b>"But what should have been added, and not being added was in the
circumstances as good as denied, was that any inference favourable
to the
plaintiff for which there was ground in the evidence might be more confidently
drawn when a person presumably able to put
the true complexion on the facts
relied on as the ground for the inference has not been called as a witness by
the defendant and
the evidence provides no sufficient explanation of his
absence.  The jury should at least have been told that it would be proper
for
them to conclude that if Hegedus had gone into the witness box his evidence
would not have assisted the defendants by throwing
doubt on the correctness of
the inference which, as I have explained, I consider was open on the
plaintiff's evidence."</b>
<P>

227   	At p.319 Windeyer J said:-
<P>

<b>"Until facts were proved from which an inference of negligence could be
drawn, the defendant was not called upon to say anything.
 His Honour, however,
had thought that such an inference could be drawn; he had refused to direct a
verdict for the defendant, and
had left the matter to the jury.  Having done
so, he should have directed them appropriately on the conclusions they might
draw from
the silence of Hegedus.  In my view he did not."</b>
<P>

228   	In <b>Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia
Limited v Ferrcom Pty Limited &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 389</a> Handley JA
said, at p.418:-
<P>

<b>"In my opinion the Court should not draw inferences favourable to the
insured on these matters when no attempt was made to prove them
by direct
evidence and in particular when no relevant questions were asked of Mr
Ferrarese.  Rather it seems appropriate to apply
the principles of <i>Jones v
Dunkel</i> ..</b>
<P>

<b>There appears to be no Australian authority which extends the principles of
<i>Jones v Dunkel</i> to a case where a party fails to ask questions of a
witness in chief.  However I can see no reason why those principles should not
apply when a party by failing to examine a witness in chief on some topic,
indicates `as the most natural inference that the party
fears to do so'.  This
fear is then `some evidence' that such examination in chief `would have exposed
facts unfavourable to the
party'."</b>
<P>

229   	Although Mr Tobias relied upon this case it seems to me,
with respect, that it does not assist his submissions in this regard.
 It was
not in issue that the Council had refused consent and that the Council officers
had recommended against consent.  So much
was proved and it was clearly within
their power to do so.  The evidence was that the decision was one on which
minds could legitimately
differ.  There was not a skerrick of evidence that the
Council officers or the councillors, who were the decision makers, had acted
unreasonably or in dereliction of their duties, such as to call for any
explanation.  No basis was laid for the drawing of any adverse
inference, the
reaching of which would be more easily achieved by the failure to call the
Council officers or the councillors.
<P>

230   	The simple fact remains that there was a decision of the
Council refusing consent to 102(2).  In my opinion, an obligation
would only
have fallen upon the Council to call its officers and councillors to justify
the decision if there was evidence led, which
there was not, that the decision
was reached in an improper manner in one of the ways to which I have referred.
In the absence of
any such evidence there was no obligation on the Council to
call any evidence as to how the decision was reached, it not being in
issue, at
least so far as Mr Darroch was concerned, that in reaching the decision the
Council could take into account the controversy,
and it not being in issue, so
far as a number of witnesses were concerned, that so far as the town planning
situation was concerned
different minds could, legitimately, reach different
conclusions.
<P>

<b>The Approach Of Talbot J</b>
<P>

231   	On 20 August 1997 Talbot J gave his decision in relation
to DA3, which he recorded was for 160 apartments and various other
facilities,
and he noted that in proceedings 10286 of 1996 the Court refused development
consent for DA2, which comprised a building
of twenty eight levels, including
twenty three of residential units, three basement levels wholly below ground
level and two levels
of plant room accommodating 170 apartments, four retail
shops and parking for 159 vehicles.
<P>

232   	At p.2 he said that it was obvious that the architectural
design of the building "is quite different to its immediate predecessor",
and
that in many respects "it has improved aspects of the building when viewed from
vantage points around Milsons Point and from
the Harbour".  He referred to the
evidence and to Mr Andersons' explanation:-
<P>

<b>".. (h)ow the design attempts to take into account physical considerations
of the site, the local built environment, the aspect from
the three street
frontages and the appearance of the development from the Harbour".</b>
<P>

He observed that Mr Andersons nevertheless recognised "that it was necessary to
abandon the parameters set by the development standards
contained in the
LEP".
<P>

233   	His Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Seidler, who
said he regarded the building as "an asocial monument to greed", and
that the
proposal "greatly exceeds the index allowed for FSR by nearly three times and
the provisions of DCP21 by contravening its
aims and objectives and failing to
meet requirements in respect of overshadowing, view preservation, street scape
and amenity and
floor space".
<P>

234   	At p.7 he said:-
<P>

<b>"The brief accepted by Mr Andersons, broadly speaking, was to address the
urban design aspects of the previous proposal criticised
by the Court, <u>while
at the same time attempting to achieve the client's expectation of providing
the same level of accommodation</u>.  It is fair to say that there is a
significant weight of evidence which suggests he has been successful in
achieving the former
objective.  Although there has been some loss of units,
the second objective has been satisfied in general terms.  While adhering
to
the view that he was entitled to abandon the parameters set by the provisions
in the LEP which, in his opinion, failed to take
account of the circumstances
of the site, he nevertheless maintained that many of the requirements in the
DCP have been incorporated
in aspects of the proposal."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

235   	Subsequently, on the same page, his Honour continued:-
<P>

<b>"There can be no doubt that the building will have visual prominence when
viewed from almost every aspect.</b>
<P>

<b>The form of the proposed tower is such that it steps up from the Alfred
Street frontage so that its highest point is situated some
distance to the west
of the high points of adjoining existing development before it reduces down to
the level of the middle element
of the building.  The real height of the
building will exceed the actual height of the adjoining Tower Life and Duxton
Hotel buildings.
 It will be more in line with the advertising excrescence
which has been added to the Tower Life building.</b>
<P>

<b>Setting aside the impact of additional traffic generation, which the Court
accepts as marginal, the development standards controlling
height and FSR are
directed at ensuring that development is of an appropriate scale and intensity
and has an acceptable impact on
the locality in general and the neighbouring
properties in particular.  There can be no argument that the location of the
site is
sensitive in relation to views available to and from the Harbour and
within Milsons Point itself."</b>
<P>

236   	After referring to a number of planning considerations,
his Honour said, at p.9:-
<P>

<b>"The presence of the Harbour and the intensity of existing development along
the ridge of Alfred Street justifies a reduction in the
size, bulk and height
of development on the land below the ridge and sloping down to the foreshore.
In the context of the planning
objectives, adherence to the purpose of the
controls is reasonable.  There is no evidence to show that a requirement for
relatively
lower scale development off the ridge is inconsistent with the
encouragement of proper management, development and conservation of
the
environment to the purpose of promoting the social and economic welfare of the
community or the promotion and co-ordination of
the orderly and economic use
and development of the land in accordance with s.5(a)(i) and (ii).  The object
of the Act is to create
a balance between the competing interests for a better
environment on the one hand, and the need to meet the demands by the community
for residential and commercial accommodation on the other."</b>
<P>

237   	The judgment concluded:-
<P>

<b>"Despite a worthy attempt to present a design which addresses the
circumstances and idiosyncracies of the site, the Court has not
been satisfied
that the SEPP 1 objection is well founded.  The Court is not able to form the
opinion that the granting of consent
to the development application would be
consistent with the aims and objectives of SEPP 1.  The underlying purposes of
the development
standards in question will not be satisfied.  There is no
justification for setting aside the development standards for the other
reasons
put forward on behalf of the applicant."</b>
<P>

238   	Many of the matters to which his Honour referred would
have been relevant to a consideration of 102(2), if the appeal from
the
Council's decision had proceeded before him, and, in particular, to a
consideration of the relevant s.90 matters, to which, for
the reasons I have
given, I am satisfied his Honour could have had regard.
<P>

239   	Even if Talbot J had not been the Judge determining the
application under 102(2), I am not satisfied that his Honour's reasoning
would
not have appealed to other Judges of the Court in relation to the modification
pursuant to 102(2).  Once the various considerations
under s.90, to which I
have referred, were allowed to intrude into the situation the plaintiff
accepted that it would have had great
difficulty in obtaining the Court's
consent to that modification.  Even if there was no concession in that regard,
in my view the
Court could not, even on the application of s.102(3A) which was
then applied by the Court, have overlooked matters referred to in
s.90, which
impacted directly upon the desirability of the proposal in 102(2).
<P>

240   	The plaintiff has failed to satisfy me that the Court, on
appeal, would have given consent to 102(2).
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr James Martin McGreevy</b>
<P>

241   	Mr McGreevy, who is a construction manager employed by
Multiplex, made a witness statement on 9 March 1999, which became
Exhibit J.
<P>

242   	In October 1995 he was the project manager at the site,
Multiplex having tendered for the demolition works of the existing
SBS
Building.  A separate "design and construction" building contract was entered
into between Multiplex and the plaintiff on 12
January 1996 providing for
practical completion on 9 January 1998. The demolition works, including bulk
excavation, began on or about
9 November 1995.
<P>

243   	Some time after 31 October 1995 Mr McGreevy was told  by
Mr Swalwell that s.102 drawings were being prepared to satisfy the
Council's
requirement that the BA submitted drawings correlated to the DA submitted
drawings and, on 7 December 1995, Mr McGreevy
received a set of the s.102
submitted drawings, which were very similar to the building contract drawings,
the latter being more
detailed as they showed the dimensions of the structure.
He recalled that work was suspended at the end of June 1996 after the
completion
of the excavation work, and that construction could not proceed
further because the plaintiff had not received an approved set of
documents
from the Council for the building works.
<P>

244   	In paragraph 11 Mr McGreevy expressed the view that had
he been asked by representatives of the plaintiff to build in accordance
with
the 102(2) drawings in June 1996, this would not have resulted in any delay to
the progress of the works, but because the contract
was "design and construct"
there may have been an increase in the amount of design work required to be
carried out by Multiplex.
<P>

245   	Mr McGreevy traced the critical path and steps which
could have been taken and, in paragraph 18, said that the time when
change may
have begun to impact on the critical path would have been if changes were
introduced after the facade had been installed.
 In paragraph 19 he said that
having reviewed the 102(2) drawings, he did not consider that they would have
had a significant effect
on the overall construction programme if they had been
issued prior to commencement of the installation of the facades and "even
then,
the impact on practical completion is hard to gauge".  He continued, in
paragraph 20, that the main impact on the progress
of the works would have been
the need to fast track the design to ensure that it met on-site construction
programme requirements.
 He referred to certain problems and to the fact that
the result of fast tracking may have exposed Multiplex to variation costs from
sub-contractors, for which costs Multiplex would have sought reimbursement from
the plaintiff, thus increasing the cost of the project.
<P>

246   	Mr McGreevy agreed, Tp.242, that the 102(2) drawings were
not, when he prepared his statement, in a fit state to commence
building
immediately.  He agreed work would have been done by Multiplex to have produced
either BA or construction drawings before
work could commence; that throughout
the project Multiplex had always been at considerable pains to remind the
plaintiff that the
drawings had to be consistent with those for which there was
consent; that from the earliest times he personally had complained to
the
plaintiff about design being developed in a way which did not reflect the
approved BA; and that from the earliest times he was
telling the plaintiff that
it was imperative that there be approvals gained for the documented design
drawings.  He agreed that he
warned the plaintiff in February 1996 that unless
such drawings were in place adverse effects would flow for the plaintiff,
including
the fact that otherwise abortive design work would have taken place,
that redesign would delay documentation and that the construction
programme
could be jeopardised. The documentation to which he was referring included
construction drawings and amended BA drawings.
 He also agreed that he made a
number of complaints to the plaintiff about having the plans conform with the
relevant approvals,
and that the consequences of not doing so would include
delay and additional cost.
<P>

247   	At Tp.246 Mr McGreevy was referred to paragraph 11 of his
statement in which he made the assumption of being asked to build
in accordance
with 102(2) drawings in June 1996.  He agreed those drawings required working
up either for a new BA or an amended
BA, and to be put into shop or for
construction  state, which would take some time.  He also agreed that
excavation was completed
by 28 June 1996, at which stage there were no plans
which would have enabled Multiplex to continue building because the contract
drawings did not accord with the current state of approvals.  He said that he
was told that there was a prospect of having approvals
by 29 July 1996,
although this did not eventuate and the delay caused the work to eventually
stop: Tp.248.
<P>

248   	He said there would have been serious disruption and
delay to the work for which Multiplex had contracted if there was no
approval.
He agreed the detailed design was the responsibility of Multiplex, subject to
its being within what was lawful in terms
of the consents.  
<P>

249   	Mr McGreevy's evidence made it clear that he was
insisting that the plaintiff obtain the necessary approvals, and that without
those approvals the final plans could not be finalised and the work continued.
Contrary to the plaintiff's case, the position was
that as at 28 June 1996
there were no plans which would have allowed building work to go forward.  In
my opinion, even without negligence,
this would have been so because the
plaintiff would have pursued DA2 in any event with the consequences which
befell it; and because
the plaintiff would not have lodged 102(2) before it in
fact did, viz on 21 October 1996.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Harvey Mark Sanders</b>
<P>

250   	Mr Sanders, whose witness statement became Exhibit 15,
was the only town planning expert called on behalf of the Council.
 He dealt
with essentially the same general matters as Mr Byrnes and Mr Ingham and, in
paragraph 6.6, expressed the following conclusion:-
<P>

<b>"On the basis of the assessment which I have made of all the relevant
material it is my opinion that in the event that DA1082/94 had
not been held to
be invalid, construction work on the project could not have commenced until all
of the documentation was in an appropriate
and acceptable form.  As I have
noted above, it is my opinion that the earliest that work could have commenced
would have been in
or around November 1997."</b>
<P>

251   	In a letter to the Council, which was stated to be a
draft, dated 15 November 1996 and to which a report was attached, Mr
Sanders
assessed 102(2) and recommended that the Council determine that the application
could not be approved under s.102 on the
basis that it was not substantially
the same development as DA1, and that it would cause prejudice to objectors.
Mr Sanders was also
aware that it was necessary to take into account s.90
considerations.  He stated, in paragraph 6.6:-
<P>

<b>"On the basis of the assessment which I have made of all of the relevant
material it is my opinion that in the event that DA1082/94
had not been held to
be invalid, construction work on the project could not have commenced until all
of the documentation was in
an appropriate and acceptable form.  As I have
noted above, it is my opinion that the earliest that work could have commenced
would
have been in or around November 1997."</b>
<P>

252   	Mr Sanders agreed in cross-examination that he was
engaged by the then solicitors for the Council in July 1996 after a Class
I
application had been lodged against the deemed refusal of DA2 and before the
Council dealt with that application.  He was asked
in July 1996 to determine
whether he could support the Council's case, and he said his commission was to
give his opinion on the
proposal and what he might do, as a town planner, if
the Council were to refuse consent.
<P>

253   	Mr Sanders was aware that an outside consultant, Mr
George, had recommended approval of DA2.  He did not agree with that
recommendation or the reasons for it.  He prepared a report for the appeal in
relation to DA2 in August 1996 and, after that appeal
was unsuccessful, he was
asked to consider whether 102(2) represented substantially the same development
as DA1 and whether, in his
opinion, any prejudice would be caused to objectors
to that development.  He wrote his draft letter on 15 November 1996 expressing
the views to which I have referred, and it was his understanding that there was
a recommendation to the Council to refuse consent.
 The report was by Mr
Beattie and was endorsed by Mr Ryan.  He agreed the resolution of the Council
was that Mr Beattie's report
be adopted.
<P>

254   	Mr Sanders agreed that it is common practice for the
proposal, the subject of the development consent, to undergo design
refinements
between the granting of that consent and building approval, which sometimes
required a s.102 modification and, in extreme
cases, a new application.
<P>

255   	Mr Tobias cross-examined Mr Sanders in respect of the
last sentence in paragraph 1.13 stating:-
<P>

<b>"However, irrespective of any such changes, it would be necessary for there
to be consistency between the development consent, as
it may have been
modified, and the building approval, as it may have been modified, before
construction work could commence on a
particular development proposal."</b>
<P>

Mr Sanders said that that proposition reflected his understanding that before
work could commence, irrespective of any changes that
might occur after that
happened, there needed to be conformity and consistency between the
documentation for the building application
and the development application.

<P>

256   	Mr Sanders said he based his letter of 15 November 1996
on a comparison of the DA1 plans and the 102(2) plans, and a consideration
of
the objections in relation to DA1, although he did not recall seeing those
objections.
<P>

257   	Mr Sanders agreed that he did not have the detailed
objections available to him, but he pointed out, with some force in my
opinion,
that his letter was based upon the statement:-
<P>

<b>"To the extent that the proposed modification will result in a building with
a greater adverse visual impact on the neighbours, we
are not satisfied that no
prejudice would be caused to any persons who objected to the development
application."</b>
<P>

258   	Mr Sanders was then cross-examined on the various changes
to which he made reference in the schedule to the draft letter
and, in dealing
with the number of bedrooms, Mr Sanders agreed with Mr Tobias' proposition that
it was a question of fact and degree.
<P>

259   	Mr Sanders maintained that the changes affected the bulk
and scale of the proposal and changed its envelope.  He repeated,
at Tp.289,
that the terms of the overall envelope were different for the purpose of his
analysis and were not substantially the same.
 He said, Tp.290, that he
concluded that overall, taking all factors into consideration, the development
was not substantially the
same development, and that went to matters other than
the envelope, and he continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. A matter upon which, would you agree, experts' minds always seem to
differ?</b>
<P>

<b>A. They can differ - not always, but they can."</b>
<P>

260   	Of course, to a substantial extent, this was the point
being made by Mr Walker and it underlined the cross-examination of
the various
witnesses called for the plaintiff that on these matters those with appropriate
expertise can legitimately hold different
views.  Accordingly, the Council, as
the initial decision maker, must determine the matter, essentially, on the
basis of various
conflicting, but none-the-less reasonably held, views and such
other relevant matters as it considers appropriate, and the Court
must do the
same, although it may not have regard to the "political" aspects.
<P>

261   	After further detailed cross-examination Mr Sanders said,
Tp.296, that his considered opinion was, and still is, that the
development is
not substantially the same as that reflected in the 102(2) drawings.  Mr Tobias
then turned to a consideration of
s.102(3A) and the circumstances in which s.90
considerations were to be applied.  Mr Sanders said that having come to the
conclusion
that the development that was sought to be modified was not
substantially the same, then he would "of necessity apply my s.90
considerations
to the overall development".  He added that if he had come to
the conclusion that the development was substantially the same he would
have
still given consideration to the impact of the overall development as sought to
be modified, which approach he took because
he understood them to be the
considerations that were given by town planners at that time.  Mr Sanders
expressed the view that prior
to May 1998 there were different views as to how
s.90 should be applied in such circumstances, and he said that s.90
considerations
were also applied because of the possibility of a series of
applications under s.102, the gist of that view being that if one overlooked
the s.90 implications, one could reach a situation in which, by dint of a
number of s.102 applications, a substantially different
development could be
achieved, overall, without the s.90 considerations having been addressed.
<P>

262   	In my opinion, essentially for the reasons to which I
have referred, it was appropriate to have regard to s.90 considerations
in the
circumstances of this case even on the approach then followed in the Court.
<P>

263   	Mr Sanders was referred to paragraph 4.9 of his report in
which he referred to the excessive bulk and scale of the development.
 It was
put to him, Tp.300, that the scheme depicted in 102(2) was far closer to DA1
than to DA2.  He said he was not able to give
an unqualified answer because he
had not made that "three-way comparison".  However, he confirmed his view that
102(2) was similar
to DA2 in terms of its overall bulk, scale and design. This
added point to the impact of s.90 considerations in an appeal against
the
refusal of 102(2). He maintained that the external envelopes of DA1 and 102(2)
did not represent to him substantially the same
development for the purposes of
s.102.  However, he pointed out that he was, of necessity, making a different
comparison between
DA1 and 102(2), on the one hand, and DA2 and 102(2) on the
other, because the first comparison demanded a finding that the development
was
"substantially the same", whereas the second did not.  He said that the
comparison that he undertook of DA2 and 102(2) was to
determine what conclusion
might have been reached regarding the impact of that development "which was a
bit different test from the
tests that I was undertaking in relation to the
comparison between DA1 and" 102(2) "where I was simply trying to identify what
the
differences were and what the totality of those differences were to
determine whether I could conclude whether or not the development
was
substantially the same ..".  He repeated, after further cross-examination, at
Tp.302, that DA1 and 102(2) were substantially
different and, for emphasis,
that they were not substantially the same.
<P>

264   	Commencing at Tp.304 Mr Sanders was cross-examined about
the times for approvals and appeals about which he had expressed
an opinion,
and he agreed that he had assumed that there were no steps taken to expedite
any of the processes, and that a developer
may attempt to have matters
expedited.  Although he allowed five months from September 1996 to February
1997 for the determination
and ultimate refusal of 102(2), he said he was aware
that it took less than two months between October and December 1996.
<P>

265   	Mr Sanders also assumed the lodgment of a Class I appeal
in February 1997 and a period of four months for its determination.
 He allowed
a further period of four months from the approval of 102(2) to the lodgment and
approval of an amended BA.  It was put
to him that these times could be
shortened.  He agreed that was possible, although, as I understood his
evidence, he said it depended
on the particular circumstances.  He was not
prepared to defer to the views of an architect in this respect, thinking that
architects
were often more optimistic than town planners.
<P>

266   	Mr Sanders was asked about Mr Beattie's recommendation
and, particularly, Mr Beattie's observation that:-
<P>

<b>"The current plans before the Council do not significantly increase the bulk
of any elements of the building but the appearance of
the building is less
satisfactory than was approved."</b>
<P>

267   	Mr Sanders said that those observations were a different
proposition from one as to whether the proposal is substantially
the same
development or not, and that any significant increase in the bulk of any
elements of the building was only one factor to
take into account in coming to
a final determination on that point: Tp.311.  Mr Sanders said, Tp.312, that he
would agree with the
proposition that the plans did not significantly increase
the bulk of any elements of the building, and that he did not agree with
Mr
Beattie's comments in relation to s.90 considerations.
<P>

268   	Mr Sanders' evidence was corroborative of the case for
which the Council contended.  It reinforced the ability of appropriately
qualified minds to differ on issues relevant to this case and the applicability
of a consideration of s.90 matters to 102(2).  I
think that Mr Sanders may have
been a little pessimistic in his time estimates, and, if it became relevant, I
would not be satisfied
that, on the plaintiff's second hypothesis, building
work would not have commenced by 1 June 1997.
<P>

<b>The Evidence of Mr Claude Arthur Jugmans</b>
<P>

269   	Mr Jugmans, whose witness statement of 19 November 1998
became Exhibit L, is a chartered accountant with extensive experience
in
financial investigations and the preparation of reports in relation to
accounting and allied matters for the purposes of litigation.
 Before turning
to his report it is desirable to have regard to a joint statement prepared by
Mr Jugmans and Mr Mark Bryant, the
expert accountant called on behalf of the
Council, in an attempt to narrow the accounting issues.  That report, which is
Exhibit
M, said that the overall methodology adopted by the experts is the
same, in that both considered what would have happened, but for
the tort, and
what has or will happen as a result of the tort, and agreed that the damages
sustained by the plaintiff can be quantified
as the difference between the cash
flows that would have been achieved, but for the tort, and those that have and
will be achieved
in the light of the tort.  They further agreed that the
methodology applied to cash flows before interest, and that a separate
calculation
should be made to allow for compensation to the plaintiff for
temporary loss of pre-interest cash flows.
<P>

270   	The report noted that both were provided with
significantly differing assumptions and instructions as to the cash flows,
comprising sales of units or gross development value, that would have been
achieved by the plaintiff under DA1; the costs that would
have been incurred by
the plaintiff in constructing the building under DA1; the timing of the cash
flows in regard to both sales
and costs; and chronologies of events that would
have taken place but for the tort.  The report also noted that Mr Bryant was
provided
with assumptions and/or instructions as to the cash flows that are
expected from constructing the building under DA4, as well as
the costs that
are likely to be incurred by the plaintiff in doing so, and that Mr Jugmans was
provided with assumptions and/or instructions
as to the value of the site as at
July 1998.  It continued that facts as to the costs actually incurred by the
plaintiff were provided
to both, and that with minor differences they were
attempting to resolve, both Mr Jugmans and Mr Bryant agreed on the quantum of
costs actually incurred by the plaintiff for the period to September 1998.
<P>

271   	In paragraph 12 it was stated that in the scenario of
what would have happened, but for the tort, Mr Jugmans and Mr Bryant
agreed on
the application of the methodology, but have been provided with different
inputs into the cash flows, such as sale values
and costs.
<P>

272   	In paragraph 13 it was noted that they received
instructions to consider differing components, particularly in regard to
the
sales, costs and the value of the site, under the scenario of what did and will
happen as a result of the tort.
<P>

273   	Exhibit M continued:-
<P>

<b>"14.	Claude Jugmans has been instructed that in order to determine the cash
flows that did and will occur, as a result of the tort,
he should only consider
costs that have actually been incurred to September 1998 and deduct therefrom
the current value of the site.
 This calculation produces a substantial loss in
that the value of the site, on the assumptions provided to Claude Jugmans, is
considerably
less than the costs that have been incurred to date.</b>
<P>

<b>  15.	Mark Bryant has been instructed that in order to determine the cash
flows arising from what did and will happen, the profit
anticipated from
developing the site under DA4 should be taken into account.  This calculation
produces a substantial profit in that
the profit anticipated from developing
the site under DA4, on the assumptions provided to Mark Bryant, is considerably
in excess
of the costs that have been incurred and that will be incurred in
developing the site under DA4."</b>
<P>

274   	In paragraph 16 it was stated that in regard to
determining the level of compensation as a result of the temporary loss of
pre-interest cash flows, Mr Jugmans and Mr Bryant differed on the rate of
return (or rate of interest) to be used, Mr Bryant calculating
it on a compound
basis using the interest rate charged to the plaintiff by its bankers, whereas
Mr Jugmans calculated it using the
average rate of return achieved on property
projects undertaken by shareholders and associates of the plaintiff.  Thus, in
concept,
the difference was one of rate.
<P>

275   	In paragraph 18 it was stated that the differences of
principle between Mr Jugmans and Mr Bryant would be resolved if the
experts
were instructed on the methodology to be adopted in determining the cash flows
that have been and will be achieved by the
plaintiff as a result of the
tort:-
<P>

<b>"In other words, in order to determine the damages suffered by Lavender is
it appropriate to take account of the profit that may be
achieved by Lavender
on the building constructed under DA4 or is it appropriate to take account of
the value of the site at the date
the damages are calculated."</b>
<P>

276   	On 10 March 1990 Mr Jugmans and Mr Bryant prepared a
further joint report.  It was noted that Appendix 3 to Mr Bryant's report
set
out actual cash flows to September 1998 in relation to the development of the
site, the net cash outflow as stated in that appendix
being $33,243,948 after
accounting for interest received and interest paid to the bank and
shareholders.  The net cash outflow to
September 1998, excluding interest
received and interest paid, amounted to $25,618,951, comprised of the base
figure of $33,243,948
from which there was a deduction of interest of
$7,647,942 and an addition of interest of $22,945.
<P>

277   	The instructions given to Mr Jugmans in relation to the
total project costs were that they were $33,320,202 including interest
paid and
interest received, the difference between the net cash outflow of Mr Bryant and
the project costs being $76,254.  The experts
were still, as at 10 March 1999,
seeking to resolve the difference in respect of that amount and the amount of
$77,635 referred to
in paragraph 11 of their statement of 5 March 1999.  In
essence this left a question to be determined in relation to the figure of
either $77,635 or $76,254, the experts ignoring the difference between those
two figures of $1,381 as immaterial.
<P>

278   	In paragraph 7 they referred to the second part of
Appendix 5 of Mr Bryant's report, which set out cash flows described as
"actual/will happen", and to paragraph 36 of his report that actual cash flows,
which did occur up to September 1998, are set out
in that part of that
appendix.  It showed the net cash outflow for the period to September 1998
"which figure is not apparent from
Appendix 5", amounting to $25,618,951,
"which is the same as the net cash outflow reflected in Appendix 3, that is
before taking
account of any interest".  
<P>

279   	In paragraph 8 it was stated that the experts were in
agreement that total costs or net cash flow incurred by the plaintiff
to
September 1998, subject to resolving the difference of $76,254, are correctly
reflected in the second part of Appendix 5 under
the heading "Actual/Will
Happen".  The matters to which I have just referred are based on the
plaintiff's chronology.  In relation
to the Council's chronology, it was noted
that Appendix 8 to Mr Bryant's report contained cash flows described as
"actual/will happen".
 The cash flow actually achieved by the plaintiff was
shown to September 1996 on Appendix 8 and not to September 1998, because Mr
Bryant's instructions as to the chronology required him to make that
assumption.  In paragraph 10 it was stated that the net cash
outflow of the
plaintiff for the period to September 1996, as reflected in Appendix 8 to Mr
Bryant's report, amounted to $21,319,487.
 In paragraph 11 it was stated that
the experts agreed that total costs or net cash outflows incurred by the
plaintiff to September
1996 of $21,319,487, subject to resolving the
differences of $76,254, are correctly reflected in the second part of Appendix
8, that
is cash flows described as "Actual/Will Happen".
<P>

280   	In paragraph 12 the difference between the figures of
$25,618,951 and $21,319,487 was noted as representing costs incurred
between
October 1996 and September 1998.  That difference of $4,299,464 was
"predominantly related to the costs incurred on DA3 and
DA4, which are shown on
page 1 of Appendix 3 to Mark Bryant's report".  Those figures are set forth and
show a total of $4,535,175,
the remaining difference of $235,711 being yet to
be reconciled.
<P>

281   	In paragraph 14, under the heading "Project Management
Fees", it was stated that in paragraph 26 of his report Mr Bryant
indicated
that costs of $1,420,000 were not "incurred" as cash payments, but as journal
entries.  They represented project management
fees recorded as payable to
Greencliff.  The paragraph continued that the experts wished to make it clear
that these project management
fees were included in the cash flows set out in
Appendix 3 to Mr Bryant's report.  The project management fees are therefore
included
in the cash flows described as "actual/will happen" shown in Appendix
5 to Mr Bryant's report.  Management fees payable to Greencliff
 to September
1996 are shown in Appendix 8 to his report, and project management fees,
assumed after September 1996 and included
in Appendix 8 to his report, were
provided to him by Messrs Green and Norris.
<P>

282   	In his report of 19 November 1998 Mr Jugmans set out, in
paragraph 1, the instructions he had received as to the sequence
of events.  In
paragraph 1.16 he stated:-
<P>

<b>"On 4 April 1996 Bruce Swalwell Architects, on behalf of Lavender lodged
DA116/96 (`DA2') with the Council.  DA2 was in respect of
a building that was
substantially similar to the building described in DA1 but took account of the
conditions imposed by the Council
in BA1 which had been consented to on 10
November 1995.  DA2 was not consented to by the Council.  Lavender lodged an
appeal with
the Land and Environment Court against the Council's determination
not to consent to DA2.  On 10 September 1996 a judgment was handed
down by the
Land and Environment Court determining that DA2 should not be consented to by
Council."</b>
<P>

283   	In the original report "BA1" read "DA1", which Mr Jugmans
corrected in his oral evidence.
<P>

284   	In Sub-section 2 of his report Mr Jugmans dealt with the
shareholders in the plaintiff and their activities and, in Sub-section
3, with
the documents he had examined.
<P>

285   	In Sub-section 4 under the heading "Issues Considered",
Mr Jugmans wrote:-
<P>

<b>"4.1	We are advised that at the time DA1 was approved by Council, Lavender
intended going ahead with the construction of The Colonnades
as outlined in
DA1.  Appropriate plans were drawn up and submitted to Council as BA95/275.  As
a result of the conditions imposed
on the consent given to the BA by Council,
amendments were made to the plans in order to comply with the conditions of
Council and
additional land was purchased by Lavender.</b>
<P>

<b>4.2	We are advised that further amendments were made to the plans in terms
of the second Section 102 application that was submitted
to the Council on 21
October 1996.  The amendments made to the plans resulted in a number of the
units being reconfigured.</b>
<P>

<b>4.3 	We are advised that the proceeds from the development and sale of The
Colonnades would have been used to finance the construction
of another property
development project.</b>
<P>

<b>4.4	We have been advised that the Council has given approval for DA4 for the
construction of a twenty six storey residential building
on the Site (`the New
Building').  It is anticipated that construction of the New Building will
commence within the next couple of
months and will be completed within
approximately twenty four months around December 2000."</b>
<P>

286   	In Sub-section 5 Mr Jugmans set forth the approach he had
adopted, noting firstly that he had estimated the losses suffered
as being the
loss of profit suffered by the plaintiff in not being able to develop and sell
The Colonnades, "which would have been
built in accordance with the amended BA
95/275 and the second Section 102 application".  He referred also to the wasted
costs incurred
by the plaintiff as a result of the invalidity of DA1, as being
additional to the loss of profit, from which he deducted the value
of the site.
He also considered the lost opportunity to finance another property, but, as I
have noted, this claim was not pursued
by the plaintiff.  In paragraph 5.3 he
set forth an alternative basis.
<P>

287   	In Sub-section 6 he dealt with the costs of construction,
commencing with noting that in January 1996 the plaintiff entered
into a
building contract with Multiplex to construct the building under a lump sum
contract for $49,500,000.
<P>

288   	In Sub-section 7 he dealt with funds invested and loaned
and, in Sub-section 8, with the estimated loss of profit.  In paragraph
8.6 he
stated, after various calculations, that the anticipated net profit, after
interest, likely to have been achieved on the development
and sale of the units
was $23,012,000.
<P>

289   	Sub-section 9 dealt with costs incurred but not
recoverable, the wasted costs being stated as $33,046,371 from which the
value
of the site of $9,200,000 was deducted giving a figure of $23,846,371.
<P>

290   	Sub-section 10 dealt with loss of opportunity, with which
it is not necessary for me to deal.  
<P>

291   	In his evidence in chief Mr Jugmans referred to
paragraphs 4 and 6 of the joint document of 5 March 1999.  He made the point
that interest on shareholders' loans to the plaintiff had been excluded from
each side of the cash flows, which meant that there
was no difference in the
result "provided one acknowledges that the differences between the cash flows
give rise to interest on damages",
which he confirmed was interest accruing to
the plaintiff.  He also said that in relation to the comparison of the actual
and hypothetical
cash flows it did not matter whether one included or excluded
interest on shareholders' loans so long as one treated it consistently
in both
calculations.  He then identified the differences between Mr Bryant and
himself, the first being a difference in the assumptions
and instructions as to
the cash inflows that would have been achieved by the plaintiff under DA1, and
the second being a difference
in assumptions and instructions in regard to the
costs that would have been incurred in constructing DA1.  He said that the
first
assumption was dependent upon the valuation evidence and that it was
hoped that the valuers would agree, and that the second assumption
was
dependent upon the evidence of quantity surveyors, and it was hoped that that
would be agreed.  In the case of such agreement,
which was ultimately achieved,
he and Mr Bryant would be able to apply the result thereby produced.
<P>

292   	In relation to timing issues Mr Jugmans agreed that he
and Mr Bryant were dependent on instructions, and in relation to the
building
under DA4 Mr Jugmans identified the difference as being whether the profit on
DA4 should be deducted from the damages, or
whether the value of the site as it
is now should be deducted from them.  Mr Jugmans contended for the latter
because he believed
that it is less speculative, and that the plaintiff has a
choice as to whether or not to continue to build the building under DA4
or
whether to sell the site "as it now is".  He added that the figure was a fairly
sure figure to take the value of the site into
account rather than a
speculative profit or loss that may be achieved on DA4 at the conclusion of
construction.
<P>

293   	Mr Jugmans acknowledged there was a risk in relation to
the construction and sale of the units, which he understood Mr Bryant
had not
taken into account.
<P>

294   	He identified a further area of disagreement as being the
rate at which interest should be charged, he contending for the
rate of return
achieved by the shareholders on their capital, whilst Mr Bryant maintained that
bank borrowing rates were applicable.
<P>

295   	In relation to the second statement of 10 March 1999, Mr
Jugmans said that he and Mr Bryant attempted to identify the agreements
they
had reached in relation to the actual costs incurred by the plaintiff to
September 1998, which had been achieved subject only
to the figure of
approximately $77,000.  He said the statement then dealt with the actual costs
incurred by the plaintiff up to September
1996, but that there was an inability
to reconcile the expenses incurred up to September 1996 with those incurred up
to the end of
September 1998.  In these circumstances Mr Jugmans was unable to
say categorically that all costs incurred by the plaintiff up to
September 1998
were included in the cash flows used by Mr Bryant in his chronology.
<P>

296   	At Tp.346 Mr Jugmans said that there were risks involved
in respect of carrying out the development contemplated by DA1.
 He was asked
to compare those risks with carrying out the development contemplated by DA4
and he said:-
<P>

<b>"In my view because DA1 under my chronology was to have been completed
already, I believe that there is less risk inherent in calculating
the profit
that would have been made on DA1 because events have - because events have
passed.  So, for example, the risk of a major
building slump in Sydney has not
happened, so therefore one doesn't have to allow for that risk in calculating
the profit."</b>
<P>

297   	He said that the major slump to which he was referring
was in prices.  He also said that there had been no significant increase
in
costs associated with the building industry.
<P>

298   	The cross-examination of Mr Jugmans commenced at Tp.348,
and at Tp.349 he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Does that mean that, so far as his Honour is concerned, he should
understand your evidence today as the evidence of somebody who
has not changed
to any degree you can presently state any of the content of your report?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's correct."</b>
<P>

299   	From that point Mr Jugmans was asked about the assumption
at paragraph 1.10, and whether it would have been affected if he
knew that the
work commenced at about that time was excavation of the site.  He said it would
make a difference from the point of
view of calculating the cash flows
associated with the excavation, and that it was relevant to a calculation of
damages to the extent
that that excavation work was carried out at about that
time and was work which would have to be carried out in any event for any
comparable project on the site.
<P>

300   	Nextly Mr Jugmans was asked whether it made any
difference to the result in his report if the construction work commenced
on 19
February 1996 by way of excavation, as opposed to 9 November 1995.  He said it
would only make a difference to the cash flows
that were associated with that
construction work, but he did not think it would change the level of damages,
nor did he think that
any difference would be caused if the work, which
preceded the middle of February 1996, was the demolition of an existing
building.
 However, he conceded he had not taken into account that that
demolition was necessary for any comparable development of the site.
 He gave
no explanation for what I consider to be an oversight.
<P>

301   	He was referred to paragraph 1.13 in which he noted when
102(1) and 102(2) were submitted to the Council.  He said he understood
in the
assumptions he was asked to make that 102(1) was one which simply outlined
differences between DA1 and the BA.  He said, Tp.351,
that the effect of his
opinion was to attribute money as damages by reason of money expended or
opportunity to earn money lost as
a result of the timing or chronology he had
been asked to assume, which meant to a man of his experience that he had
expressed an
opinion that certain money is necessary to compensate as damages
for the events set out in his assumed chronology, which he agreed
assumed that
his opinion was asserting that there was some causal link, from the financial
and business points of view, between the
events in the chronology and the
damages.  He agreed, Tp.352, that it is elementary that to the extent that the
events which gave
rise to the expenditure or which reduced an opportunity to
make money were not consequences of the event giving rise to liability,
they
did not belong in a category of money necessary to compensate by way of
damages, although he said he was making no determination
of a causal link.
<P>

302   	He said he made no assumption as to whether 102(1) was
refused or granted, but that he had made an assumption that some kind
of
development based on DA1 as amended would have happened.  He explained "as
amended" by saying:-
<P>

<b>"The outcome of the section 102 application because I understand that
amendments were made to the structure of the building and, as
a consequence,
amendments were made to the selling prices that could be obtained from the sale
of units in that building because
of the section 102 second
application."</b>
<P>

The basis for this assumption provided further support for the submission that
the plaintiff did not wish to build conformably with
DA1.
<P>

303   	He was then asked to identify where he had made any
assumption about 102(2), which he said was in paragraph 8.5 where the
selling
prices were reduced by the effect of 102(2).  He said that explanation was the
sum total of his understanding of 102(2):
Tp.353.  Certainly he was not asked
to assume that 102(2) would, but for the tort, have been lodged in March/April
1996.  This, in
my opinion, was highly significant, given that it was the
primary basis on which at trial the plaintiff put its case.  It supports
the
conclusion to which I have come that it was the intention to proceed with DA2
in about April 1996 and that it was not decided
to lodge 102(2) until October
1996.
<P>

304   	Mr Jugmans was then referred to paragraph 4.1, which
referred to amendments to the plans, which he said he understood were
conditions of the BA and "amendments made to the plans" in order to comply with
those conditions, i.e. of the BA.  He was asked whether
it made a difference if
the so-called amendments to the plan were in fact made to obtain consent for a
different development, being
the building which Dr Quek wanted to build, to
which he replied, Tp.355:-
<P>

<b>"I think that's really out of my hands as to whether it would have or not
because it's up to the quantity surveyors or the valuers
or the architects to
tell me what building was going to be built and what costs and revenues were
going to be incurred or received,
and that's the basis on which I
proceeded."</b>
<P>

305   	Mr Jugmans said that he assumed completion of the
building on 9 January 1998: paragraph 10.11, it being part of his assumption
that the building work would be completed by then, and he assumed no slippage,
disruption or extensions of time under the building
contract. He thus assumed
the most favourable position to the plaintiff.  He was then asked about risk in
relation to the hypothetical
case, and he agreed that he did not have any
knowledge of what might have happened under that particular building contract
in relation
to delays, disruption or extensions of time.  It was put to him
that the risk in the hypothetical case was more or less the same
as that in the
actual case, and he replied that one could find out from building companies
about the history of delay on contracts
that were completed up until now,
although that had not been done in any assumption or information given to him.
He agreed he was
aware that building projects were delayed and disrupted or the
subject of extensions of time and that there could be a change in
his "bottom
line" figure if some such matters occurred.  Mr Jugmans' failure to explore
these matters further cause me, in part,
to consider his evidence with some
concern.
<P>

306   	At Tp.358 he said he did not deal with DA4 on a risk of
delay basis, because he did not consider the cashflows on DA4, which
he
described as "the actual case".  He was asked about the differences between DA1
and DA4 and, at Tpp.359-360, he agreed that as
DA1 was never built one could
not know what would have happened except by estimates and likelihoods, and
further that estimates and
likelihoods are also the means by which one might
reach a conclusion now about what will happen in the future to DA4.  The
cross-examination
continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Whether these particular apartments would have been attractive or not
attractive on the actual market we now know about for DA1
is itself a matter of
estimate rather than knowledge; do you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Is one of the reasons why you prefer to take only land value into account
when comparing the actual to the hypothetical case because
of the uncertainties
of the future, including the risk that a building contract might be
delayed?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, that is a risk factor.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. That of course is exactly the same component of risk as continues to
apply to the hypothetical case, DA1, isn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's correct.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So that doesn't justify altering the nature of the figures to be
compared, does it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's correct."</b>
<P>

There was an inherent inconsistency in this evidence, which meant, as Mr
Jugmans agreed, that there was no justification for altering
the figures
because of that risk element.  Once again this causes me to ponder on the
approach he took and the methodology he adopted,
in so far as it differed from
Mr Bryant's approach.
<P>

307   	Mr Jugmans agreed that if the timing in relation to
102(2) was as actually occurred he would have to take into account different
timing, which would lead to a considerably different assumed completion date,
because he had assumed that by 21 October 1996, under
a contract entered into
on 12 January 1996, building work beyond excavation would be well advanced, and
that other factors could
affect timing, as to which he said he had not been
given any information, although he continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. But it must be implicit in what you have assumed about completion date
in accordance with the building contract entered into in
January 1996 a further
assumption of yours that BA plans, DA plans and building contract plans were in
conformity with each other
to the extent necessary to allow lawful work to
proceed; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, yes, it is.  I mean, I never considered it that way.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. It must follow, must it not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I'm sure it does.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. To be quite clear, you've never been asked to assume anything about dates
when sets of plans were brought into conformity sufficient
to permit lawful
building work; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. No, I haven't made any assumptions in that regard."</b>
<P>

308   	Pausing there I find the failure by Mr Jugmans to
consider those matters somewhat extraordinary.  Perhaps it is fairer to
Mr
Jugmans to say that it is strange that he was not asked to make any assumptions
about those matters, particularly having regard
to the evidence of Mr McGreevy.
Central to any concept of a cashflow must be the period to which one is
entitled to have regard.
 In the present case, having regard to the various
complexities the hypothetical case would have raised, I would have expected a
person seeking to ascertain the period within which the building would be
erected to have made assumptions on the various steps necessary
to enable
lawful building work to commence and to be completed, rather than simply taking
a completion date by reference to a building
contract.  I accept that in some
cases that may have been a permissible course, for example if either all the
necessary approvals
had been given or would have been given without any real
difficulty.  However, that was not the present case.  I also find it difficult
to accept that it is not appropriate to take into account the risk of delays,
disruptions and other exigencies of building work,
particularly having regard
to the scope of the building work, in determining the reality of the
contractually stipulated completion
date.
<P>

309   	Mr Jugmans was then taken to the marketing of the units
off-the-plan.  He said he had made an assumption that some of the
configurations of some of the units had to be changed, which would affect the
selling prices by reducing them or leading to concessions
being made to
potential purchasers, who had already paid deposits.  He agreed there were
risks in selling off-the-plan, including
the risk that potential purchasers
would not proceed if there was a change in configuration, but he said that in
looking at the risks
under DA1 he assumed that if one purchaser was not going
to complete the contract as a result of a change another purchaser "would
be
fairly easily obtained to replace" the first.  He agreed this meant that he
assumed a total take-up,  but he was not prepared
to make the same assumption
in relation to DA4 because he believed that the economic conditions at the
completion of DA4 "may well
be different to the economic conditions that exist
when DA1 was supposed to be completed".  He agreed economic conditions change
and, in relation to this building, that it is on a very good site, so that it
should be most attractive to purchasers, and that it
was going to be a top
class building, thus leading to a top class building in a desirable residential
area.  I am not satisfied that
there was any intellectually sustainable reason
why one would not apply the same risk considerations to each building.  Mr
Jugmans
did not supply any.
<P>

310   	At Tp.364 Mr Jugmans said that it was his understanding,
from information he received from Dr Quek or somebody that worked
for him, that
the plaintiff would have had the benefit of work continuing towards completion
of an amended DA1 project continuously
from 28 June 1996.  This assumption was
inconsistent with the evidence of Mr McGreevy.  He said that was not included
in his report
as an assumption, and he did not recall anyone telling him to
assume anything about the capacity for 102(1) to be approved at all.
 He
agreed, as I understood his evidence, that if 102(1) did not have the capacity
to be approved, and without such approval building
work beyond excavation could
not proceed, that would make a difference to the way he proceeded to his bottom
line from a timing point
of view.  He agreed timing was critical in the sense
that calculations must be made depending on timing, and that it would make a
difference to critical timing if he were to assume that 102(2) was properly and
reasonably refused.  He said that he had not performed
calculations or
expressed any bottom line which took into account those possibilities.
<P>

311   	Mr Jugmans agreed that if, contrary to his assumption
about the relationship between DA1 and DA2, DA2 was not substantially
the same
as DA1 and was for a different development, that would alter his approach to
the bottom line as the selling prices and the
costs of construction would be
different.
<P>

312   	At Tp.366 Mr Jugmans agreed that underlying his report
was the notion that but for the tort DA1 would have been exploited
by the
plaintiff.  I do not accept that DA1 provided the approval vehicle through
which the plaintiff would have developed.  Thus
a primary assumption on which
Mr Jugmans proceeded has not been established.  He said that part of his
reasoning in paragraph 1.16,
where he set out the assumption, included DA2 as
part of a coherent scheme or sequence by the plaintiff towards exploitation of
DA1.
 He said he also assumed that the form of and the necessity to make DA2
was brought about to accommodate the invalidity of DA1, which
was the reason
why he treated it as part of the timing sequence "which financially you opine
is to the account of the defendant".
 This assumption does not accord with the
evidence I accept, viz that DA2 would have been lodged irrespective of whether
the Council
was negligent.
<P>

313   	He also said that, subject to questions of mitigation, if
DA2 was different from DA1 he would take it out of the timing and
financial
consequence of DA1's invalidity, and that he was not asked in relation to the
matters noted in paragraph 1.16 to assume
anything about the content of DA2 or
the reasons for its rejection by the Council and the Court.  Nor was he asked
to make any assumptions
about the content of DA3, the reasons for its refusal
by the Council, or the outcome of DA3 after that refusal.  He assumed that
the
lodging of DA3, and the persistence with it to the point of a Council refusal,
was part of a coherent scheme by the plaintiff
to try and achieve what it had
lost by the invalidity of DA1, and, if that assumption was not available, he
agreed that matters to
do with DA3, including delay costs referable to it,
should not be put to the account of compensatory damages payable by the
Council.
<P>

314   	In relation to DA4 he assumed that the plaintiff did
everything in its power to in fact get on with the building.
<P>

315   	Mr Jugmans agreed that timing was a factor to be taken
into account, but he would not agree that it was critical in that
it could make
a difference between loss or no loss.  At Tp.370 Mr Jugmans agreed that he had
not done any calculation of the element
of loss critically dependent on the
timing assumed, otherwise than upon the timing assumed in the passages set out
in Section 1 of
his report as updated with the knowledge of the BA for DA4.
<P>

316   	At Tp.371 Mr Jugmans said that there was nothing he
wished to change about the expression of assumptions in paragraph 4.1,
which
assumptions he agreed were fundamental to the expert opinion he had given
attributing certain financial consequences as damages
payable by the Council.
He agreed that in paragraph 4.2 he went straight from DA1 and BA1 to 102(2),
but he said it was not a matter
of significance that he did not refer to DA2
and DA3 in that part of his report.  He maintained that he regarded them in
order for
their costs consequences to be to the account of the Council, as
necessary to be seen as attempts by the plaintiff to get the benefit
of what
the invalidity of DA1 took away.
<P>

317   	He said that he had not been asked to make an assumption
about the completion date for DA4. 
<P>

318   	At Tp.372, somewhat contrary to what had occurred, Mr
Jugmans agreed that if he thought it fair or sensible to use the contractual
date for completion for the DA1 hypothesis, then, when looking to the future of
DA4 to make a proper comparison, he would do the
same for it.  It is clear he
did not.  This was another unsatisfactory aspect of his evidence.
<P>

319   	Mr Jugmans said that he did not assume that approval was
given to 102(1), but rather to 102(2) which was some time after
21 October
1996.  He continued, Tp.373:-
<P>

<b>"Q. It is just silly, isn't it, for your opinion to be expressed on an
assumed timing that prevents anything lawfully being done until
some time after
21 October 1996, apart from excavation; is that right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, if that's the case, if that's correct and that no building could
take place until whatever date it was and that changes the
timing of the
completion of the contract, then, as I said before, I would have to change the
timing of the figures that I've used.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. It throws out the only way you've calculated damages, doesn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It throws out the timing of the damages, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. That's the only way you have calculated damages?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It's the only way - yes, that's right."</b>
<P>

320   	The various concessions made by Mr Jugmans, including the
one to which I have just referred, and the elements of his evidence
which were,
in my opinion, properly the subject of attack and to which I have referred,
were used in submissions to support the proposition
that whatever might be the
figure at which he arrived, it was not sufficiently certain to allow the
plaintiff to submit that it had
established its damages on the balance of
probabilities.  In my opinion this submission, which is supported by certain
further evidence
of Mr Jugmans to which I shall refer, should, generally
speaking, be accepted.
<P>

321   	Mr Walker then cross-examined Mr Jugmans about paragraph
5.1 of his report and paragraph 5 of the 5 March 1999 statement.
 He said he
was sure 5.1 was the same as paragraph 5 in the 5 March statement, and that he
studied paragraph 5 closely before signing
it.  He was asked about the
statement of cashflows "that have and will be achieved" by the plaintiff as a
result of the tort.  He
said they included DA4 cashflows, and it was then put
to him that DA4 was the only known source of cashflows that the plaintiff would
achieve, to which he replied that the difference in taking account of DA4 is
that he had taken account of the value of the site of
DA4 as it is now, and Mr
Bryant had taken account of the cashflows that will emanate from the building
of DA4.
<P>

322   	Mr Jugmans agreed that the only cashflows to be achieved
would be by exploiting DA4 either by completing the building or
selling the
site, and that paragraph 5.1 of his report was consistent with that.  He
continued that it was one of the reasons why
he did not look at the development
for eventual sale under DA4 as the proper point for comparison, because of a
perception that the
risk differed between DA1 and DA4.  He advanced another
reason, namely that the plaintiff has a choice, as he understood it, to either
sell the site or to continue with the development, but he then conceded, as
must have been obvious, that that was a possibility if
there was a development
under DA1.  Indeed he conceded it was "as much a possibility": Tp.376.  When
pressed that the choices were
exactly the same for DA1 and DA4 he intruded into
the discussion questions as to whether the Foreign Investment Review Board
would
grant approval, and this led to his saying that he knows now that the
plaintiff has the choice to sell the land in its present condition
because Dr
Quek told him of that in the last couple of months.  He was reminded that he
had said that he did not want to change any
of the assumptions at the
commencement of the cross-examination, and that there was no reference to this
particular matter as an
assumption.  All of this disintegrated when Mr Jugmans
conceded that he had not been given any instructions, nor had he made any
assumptions, about the position being different for the hypothetical amended
DA1.  He was further cross-examined about the possibility
of compliance with
Foreign Investment Review Board requirements for selling an amended DA1 and he
agreed, ultimately, that it was
not available as a reason to justify the
approach in 5.1 of his report that there was in fact Foreign Investment Review
Board approval
for the sale of DA4.
<P>

323   	If I may say so with great respect to Mr Jugmans, I found
his attempt to differentiate on this particular ground, which was
covered in
cross-examination particularly at Tpp.379-380, quite unconvincing, and it led
me to the conclusion that in certain material
respects Mr Jugmans was not
comparing like with like in making an assessment of the hypothetical positions
which obtained under DA1
and which now obtain under DA4.  The type of
difficulty, which confronted Mr Jugmans, was exemplified at Tp.380:-
<P>

<b>"Q. But everything is hypothetical about DA1, isn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, it is.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Well, why does that justify treating them differently?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Treating, what, the assumptions on DA1?</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>A. I'm not treating any of the assumptions on DA1 differently."</b>
<P>

324   	Mr Jugmans was cross-examined at some length about using
the value of the land without a development.  He said that but for
the tort he
assumed there would have been development, and that after the tort he still
assumed there will be development. It was
put to him that in those
circumstances the comparison would appear to be between developed land in a
hypothetical case and developed
land in the actual case, which he said was the
approach that Mr Bryant adopted.  He said his approach was slightly different.
He
did not agree that the comparison was between the hypothetical no tort
development and the yet to happen tort development.  He said
the damages are
the difference between the hypothetical development and what the plaintiff has
today, which is either the value of
the land or the value of the profit that
will ultimately be achieved.  He agreed that none of the assumptions in his
report justified
a different approach to the risk of building development and
sales for the hypothetical DA1 from the yet to happen DA4, and that
in that
respect he ought, if he was being intellectually consistent, to treat them as
similar for the purposes of his calculations.
 He agreed that for the
hypothetical situation he assumed what did not happen, namely completion of an
amended DA1 to the point of
paying the builder everything and getting all the
money from the purchasers.  It was suggested to him that to be intellectually
consistent
he should do the same in respect of DA4 and he agreed that is the
alternative calculation.  He also agreed that was picked up in
paragraph
5.3.
<P>

325   	Mr Jugmans said that effectively the exercise conducted
was to compare what would have happened under an amended DA1, and
what is
likely to happen under DA4, to adjust the time and to see what result is
produced.  However, he agreed that he had done the
second part of the
comparison not by a cashflow in relation to the plaintiff's stated likely gross
realisations, "but by simply plugging
in a single and inscrutable figure called
market value".  Mr Jugmans sought to defend that approach and he was then asked
why it
was not done by taking the market value of the land with the benefit of
the amended DA1, which he said was a way "of doing it" which
he accepted, and
he continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. To be intellectually coherent you'd want to do that as an expert,
wouldn't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, I accept that that is correct.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You've not done it, have you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's correct.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. What you have done is to jumble up two different approaches whereby you
have risked comparing things which are not alike, do you
agree? Do you
agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. The methodology is certainly different in that regard.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. What I've said to you may be unkind but is accurate; is that
right?</b>
<P>

<b>A. If it was absolutely certain that DA4 would be developed and that DA4
would not be sold, then I accept your proposition.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. What makes anything about your assumptions for amended DA1 absolutely
certain?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Reasonably certain then, not absolutely certain - reasonably
certain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. They enjoy the same degree, do they not, of risk; you've agreed with
that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. They do.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Returning then to what I've said, to use a cashflow approach on one side
and a land value approach on the other side is to risk
jumbling concepts and
comparing some things which are not like; do you agree?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, if they are all on reasonable assumptions, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Does it affect any of your evidence today if you're asked to assume that
Lavender View Regency presently intends to develop the
land in accordance with
DA4?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Sorry, would it affect ..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. .. any of the evidence you've given today if you are asked to assume that
Lavender View Regency presently intends to develop the
land in accordance with
DA4 at this present time?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, then I would take the deduction not being the value of the land as
it is now; I would take the deduction as being the profit
or loss that may be
achieved in DA4.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Mr Bryant's approach?</b>
<P>

<b>A. That's correct": Tpp.386-387.</b>
<P>

This cross-examination revealed several basic flaws in the reasoning adopted by
Mr Jugmans.  He was undoubtedly "jumbling" concepts.
 He was forced to agree
that on the only hypothesis I understand to be put forward, viz development and
sale pursuant to DA4, he
would follow the reasoning of Mr Bryant.
<P>

326   	No evidence was given by the plaintiff that it intended
to sell the land before completing DA4.  Until Mr Jugmans mentioned
the further
instructions or information he had received from Dr Quek about receiving the
Foreign Investment Review Board's approval
to the sale this matter had not been
raised.  Dr Quek gave no evidence that this is what the plaintiff proposed to
do: nor did anyone
else on its behalf.  In those circumstances it seems to me
that the only reasonable assumption is to proceed on the basis that the
development will be completed and, accordingly, on the concession that Mr
Bryant's basic approach is correct.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Mark Bryant</b>
<P>

327   	The witness statement of Mr Mark Bryant of 23 February
1999, is Exhibit 18.  Mr Bryant is a chartered accountant and the
partner in
charge of Messrs Arthur Andersen's Dispute Analysis Practice in the
Asia/Pacific Region.  As with Mr Jugmans his qualifications
were not in
issue.
<P>

328   	In Part A of his report Mr Bryant set out his
instructions and, in Part B, a summary of his major conclusions.  In paragraph
15 the report stated:-
<P>

<b>"We have calculated damages by comparing the profits LVR" (the plaintiff)
"would have earned with DA1 approval (using NSC" (the defendant's)
"assumptions
as to chronology) with profits that will now actually be made (assuming DA3
application did not take place).  This method
calculates damages as negative
$1,933,000.  That is, LVR is now $1,933,000 better off than it would have been
had it:</b>
<P>

<b>	not suffered the delay from NSC's action; and</b>
<P>

<b>	not submitted the DA3 application.</b>
<P>

<b>Our calculation includes interest or discount to 28 February 1999.</b>
<P>

<b>Details of how we calculated this amount, and the other calculations we were
asked to perform, are contained in Sections D to F of
our report."</b>
<P>

329   	In paragraph 16 Mr Bryant asserted that Mr Jugmans had
used inappropriate methodology, principally in that he double counted
costs of
$33m, which he classified as "wasted" or "non recoverable"; that he failed to
compare like with like, in that he added in
the profits which he calculated
would have been made from a developed site, but deducted the current value of
the undeveloped land,
rather than deducting the profits that are likely to be
made from the current development; and in that he sought to compensate for
loss
of use of money by reference to a hypothetical, and very profitable, additional
development, which he was asked to assume would
have occurred had "The
Colonnades" project not been deferred.  It is not necessary to be concerned
with this last matter as opportunity
loss is not pursued.
<P>

330   	In Section C Mr Bryant carried out verification
procedures on income and expenditure and classified expenditure and, in Section
D, he set forth profits that would have been made and that will now be made
based on the plaintiff's chronology.
<P>

331   	In paragraph 30 Mr Bryant summarised and calculated the
profits that the plaintiff would have earned from a development of
the site,
but for the actions of the Council, and the cashflows that have actually
occurred and are now predicted.  The first matter
dealt with is the chronology
of the plaintiff which forms Appendix 4 to the Report.  That chronology
commences with the marketing
of units in May 1995 and concludes with contract
completion on 3 February 1998 and sale funds being received in full in April
1998.
 It also contemplates 102(2) having been lodged on 5 March 1996 and
approval to it being given by the end of May 1996.
<P>

332   	In Section E Mr Bryant calculated the profits that the
plaintiff would have earned from a development of the site but for
the actions
of the Council, and the cashflows that have actually occurred/or are now
predicted (adjusted to remove the actual costs
of the plaintiff's DA3
application) all based on the Council's assumptions as to chronologies attached
at Appendix 7.  Appendix 7
provides for a chronology of DA4 being lodged on 16
December 1996 and funds received in August 1999.
<P>

333   	In Section F there is a commentary on Mr Jugmans' report
and, in paragraph 65, a particular criticism that Mr Jugmans' methodology,
even
after adjusting to remove the double counting of "non recoverable" costs, does
not compare like with like.
<P>

334   	In his evidence in chief Mr Bryant described what he
understood to be the Council's primary case as being portrayed in Section
E of
his report.  He continued, Tp.450:-
<P>

<b>"In essence, that is that, based on the chronologies with which we were then
instructed and the figures with which we were then instructed,
that Lavender
View is essentially in a very similar position now as it would have been; in
other words, it is now completing a building,
and on the chronology we have
been given that had there been no tort and also had Lavender View not pursued
DA3, it would be in much
the same position as it now is.  That is my
understanding of the defendant's primary position."</b>
<P>

335   	In its written outline of submissions on damages the
plaintiff asserted, correctly, that Mr Jugmans and Mr Bryant agreed
that its
losses were to be assessed by comparing its present position with that it would
have enjoyed but for the Council's wrong,
and that those losses are to be
established by quantifying the difference between "actual" and "hypothetical"
cash flows.  It was
submitted, once again I consider correctly, that the cash
flows are to be compared, so far as possible, "on a like basis, and that
the
principal difference in principle between the experts:-
<P>

<b>`.. is whether the plaintiff's actual position should be established by
taking into account, in the relevant cash flow, the present
value of the land
or the estimated proceeds of the development of land'."</b>
<P>

336   	In dealing with this difference it is, in my opinion,
important to note that the suggestion that the land would be sold rather
than
developed pursuant to DA4 was never made by or on behalf of the plaintiff, but
was a matter intruded into the evidence by Mr
Jugmans in the circumstances to
which I have referred.
<P>

337   	It was submitted that in considering that issue it is
crucial to bear in mind that the exercise of determining the "actual"
cash
flow, being the cash flow based on the assumption that DA4 will be completed,
involves establishing the present value of the
calculated future cash flows.
Reliance was placed on the evidence of Mr Bryant at Tpp.459-460.  In that
evidence Mr Bryant said that
it is necessary to establish the present value of
the cash flows or the difference between them, although in that circumstance it
is not appropriate to make an allowance for risk.  He agreed that one needed to
determine what the cash flows will be; then at a
point of time the positive or
negative effect of that to determine whether there will be a positive income
stream; and then to establish
the present day value.  He further agreed that
the establishment of the present day value involved discounting for the time
factor,
although he said it did not involve discounting for the risk factor.
He conceded that if he was carrying out the same exercise for
the sale of a
business he would discount for the risk factor "wherever there was a risk
apparent".  He was asked whether it was not
appropriate to carry out that
exercise in the present case because he was comparing the outcome of one
hypothetical development with
another hypothetical development and he said:-
<P>

<b>"Yes.  It did occur to me that you could attempt to apply a risk - a
discount for risk for both, but in this circumstance it seemed
to me more
appropriate to leave both of them as raw cash flows and discount only for time
value of money",</b>
<P>

which, he agreed, meant there was no "risk weighting at all".  He repeated that
he had "simply excluded risk from both calculations".
<P>

338   	At Tp.461 he agreed that in terms of valuing the present
opportunity from an accounting viewpoint he would normally advise
that there
should be a discount for risk, which would involve giving consideration to the
circumstances which might bear on that.
 In relation to the development of land
he agreed that risk factors would be whether it could be carried out for the
contracted costs,
within the contracted time, and in circumstances where
purchasers proceeded to complete.  He agreed a fourth factor was the ability
to
sell all the units.  He gave his reasons for excluding risk thus:-
<P>

<b> "Q. In the comparison which you're undertaking, you would say, would you
not, that those two matters - DA1 in the past, DA4 in the
future - in effect
cancel out?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. On the basis, as you understand it, it is the same builder, similar
contractual terms, etc?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. So we can exclude that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

339   	He was then taken to the risk of purchasers defaulting
and of sales not occurring.  He agreed these would depend on economic
conditions and, so far as future sales are concerned, some degree of
speculation.  Mr Bryant agreed he had not investigated these
matters because he
had been asked to assume that the degree of risk in relation to DA1 and DA4 is
the same.  At Tp.467 he agreed
that if I were to conclude that the degree of
risk is not relevantly the same for the two developments his exercise did not
disclose
how to reflect that degree of difference of risk.
<P>

340   	Mr Bryant said he did not think the development pursuant
to DA4 gave rise to the prospect of any loss, although he agreed,
as is
obvious, that this depended upon the assumed figures as to time and inputs.
<P>

341   	He agreed Mr Jugmans' approach of taking the current land
value left profit and risk elements out of consideration, although
he either
qualified or added to that by saying that it did not leave out the profit on
the development, so much as leave out the
remaining cash flows "and the
remaining cash flows on any view of what is occurring are a substantial
positive number".
<P>

342   	It was submitted that the comparison of the plaintiff's
actual and hypothetical positions involved an element of speculation
or
contingency in the sense, so far as DA4 was concerned, of completing "in time
and on budget".  Precisely the same contingencies
applied in relation to DA1
and the point made by the Council is that one cannot ignore them in relation to
one development, which
never went ahead, and take them into account in respect
of another development, which is going ahead.  In the hypothetical situation
one would have to allow for the vicissitudes and contingencies as in the actual
situation.  It does not seem to me to be an answer
to this to submit, as the
plaintiff did, that:-
<P>

<b>"The only reason in principle which has been advanced or which can be
advanced for failing to do so is that exactly the same contingencies,
in
exactly the same degree, attend the calculation of the hypothetical
position."</b>
<P>

343   	In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the onus
in my opinion being on the plaintiff to produce such evidence, there
is no
reason why such an assumption cannot be made.  This is pointed up by the
further submission of the plaintiff:-
<P>

<b>".. that if the risks attending the hypothetical situation can be
distinguished either in identity or in degree from those attending
the actual
situation then the basis upon which Mr Bryant has calculated the plaintiff's
damage is flawed so that, even if the assumptions
as to time underlying it are
established, it cannot be relied upon."</b>
<P>

344   	The fact is, however, that no such distinguishing
elements were identified.  Mr Jugmans had made no assumptions as to what
would
have happened: Tp.357.
<P>

345   	The plaintiff's submission continued that the risks
attending the two developments "are undoubtedly of the same kind", but
"they
are not the same in degree".  There is no evidence to support this, nor to
support the further submission that if DA1 had commenced
at the latest by June
1997 it would now be complete and, even if construction did not commence until
December 1997, it would be substantially
complete.  This submission is founded
upon the following:-
<P>

<b>"We know how the building industry has performed over that time and we know,
as historical data, the circumstances that might have
affected completion of
the project in time and on budget.  The same cannot be said of the completion
of DA4."</b>
<P>

If I may say so, with the greatest respect to the submission, this is pure
speculation, as is any prognostication about the carrying
out of the building
work pursuant to DA4.
<P>

346   	The submissions nextly turned to the real point of
difference being the sales histories of DA1 and DA4.  Reference was made
to the
evidence which showed that in the first four and a half months of sales off the
plan of DA1 (as modified) sixty two contracts
were exchanged totalling
$32,569,970 in value.  This was said to be 31.5% of the total value of the
units and was contrasted with
the position under DA4, which shows that thirty
five units were sold for the first four and a half months with a total value of
$18,291,450.
 This amounts to some 14.7% of the total unit value, and there has
been, from the evidence, discounting of list prices.
<P>

347   	It was further submitted that it was not appropriate to
compare the two cash flows as though the risk element was the same
in degree in
each, because the evidence shows "very significant factors", which would
require further investigation "and might warrant
a revision of the assumption
as to parity of risk".  The submission continued:-
<P>

<b>"Since that exercise has not been carried out the plaintiff submits that it
is inappropriate to allow the defendant, being the wrong
doer whose conduct has
caused the plaintiff to suffer loss, to have the benefit of that risk and to
put the plaintiff to bear that
risk.  As between a party who is innocent and a
party who is admittedly guilty, any risk should be assessed against the guilty
party."</b>
<P>

In response Mr Walker submitted that this was a bold forensic approach, because
it accepted that the plaintiff had not proved that
there was any greater risk
factor.  This submission seems to hark back to the <b>Houghton</b> submission,
which I have rejected.
<P>

348   	In my opinion the onus was on the plaintiff to establish
that the various risks about which it makes submissions will, as
a matter of
probability, come to pass, whereas that would not have occurred in the
hypothetical case.  Thus it was for the plaintiff
to compare the situation
which would have existed on the assumption that DA1 had been built, with the
risk which attends the building
and sale of DA4.
<P>

349   	Finally, on this aspect, it was submitted that Mr
Jugmans' approach effectively eliminated risk and should be preferred.
 On the
other hand Mr Walker submitted that Mr Jugmans did not take that approach, but
embraced risk and equalised it by putting
all the risk factors into DA4 and
none into DA1.  In my opinion, the submission is correct.
<P>

350   	In relation to loss of opportunity the plaintiff
submitted that it accepted that its loss of opportunity damages should be
measured by applying to its loss of proceeds from DA1 an interest factor.  It
submitted the difference between Mr Jugmans and Mr
Bryant was whether that
factor should be calculated at the cost of bank funds to the plaintiff, as Mr
Bryant maintained, or the intra
group loan rate, as Mr Jugmans maintained.
<P>

351   	The reason for Mr Bryant's approach was that this was a
more usual way of calculating the interest component.  However, the
evidence
satisfied me that in this case interest was based on the way in which the
plaintiff borrowed its funds and, in these circumstances,
the Council being
obliged to take the plaintiff as it found it, and there being no suggestion
that the interest rate was devised
at some later time, the rate should be that
contended for by the plaintiff.  Further, on this aspect, there is no
suggestion that
the interest rates claimed are so far away from bank interest
rates as to be treated as artificial or unacceptably high.
<P>

<b>The Agreement Between The Valuers</b>
<P>

352   	Exhibit 16 is a document evidencing agreement between the
valuers, which shows that the agreed figure for the gross realisation
of the
units being built pursuant to DA4 will be $90.25m, and that as at 31 January
1999 the value of the site with the DA4 approval
is $16.25m.  It also shows
agreement that DA1 with 102(2) approval would have realised $100m. This
assumes, contrary to the view
to which I have come, that 102(2) approval would
have been obtained either from the Council or the Court.
<P>

353   	The first mentioned figure reduced the gross realisation
shown in Exhibit 5 of $93,653,650 by some $3m.  Exhibit 5 was an
analysis of
units sold from 20 October 1998 to 4 March 1999.
<P>

<b>Exhibit 17</b>
<P>

354   	Exhibit 17 comprises four facsimile transmissions of 7
March 1996.  The first is from the solicitors for the plaintiff to
the
plaintiff enclosing a copy of a letter from them to Dr Quek of that date.  In
that letter the solicitors told Dr Quek that they
had advised the then
solicitors for the Council that there was a serious issue as to the validity of
DA1; that the plaintiff had
no desire to engage in any conflict with the
Council which could be avoided, and that the heavy liability which the Council
may have
for a void development approval must be apparent to it; and that the
course most likely to reduce the Council's liability and to
enable the
plaintiff to proceed was for the plaintiff to lodge a new DA, it being in the
interests of the parties to "agree" in principle
upon the terms of the DA to be
submitted.
<P>

355   	The letter stated that a meeting was to be held with the
Council on 8 March 1996, and continued:-
<P>

<b>"It is critical that LVR can at that time identify in precise terms, in
writing and without any ambiguity, what the proposed Application
will contain.
Otherwise when it is lodged the officers, if they wish to resile from the views
they state in the meeting, may well
assert that the lodged application is
different from what was discussed at the meeting."</b>
<P>

It is somewhat strange that the plaintiff's solicitors were making this point
to their client if there was no doubt how the plaintiff
proposed to proceed.
However, of significance was the reference to a new DA, and the absence of
reference to an application pursuant
to s.102.  This may well be explicable in
the light of the challenge to DA1.
<P>

356   	The next facsimile was from the solicitors for the
plaintiff to the secretary of the plaintiff referring to the letter to
Dr Quek
and stating that he believed it was essential that a meeting take place with
the Council and its solicitor "with a view to
having council `agree' to the
development application which we propose to submit".
<P>

357   	The letter continued that the writer could not agree that
there was any point in the meeting until the plaintiff "is able
to state
precisely and in writing what the application will contain".  It continued:-
<P>

<b>"<u>Dr Quek's view is firstly that this can be given to Council now</u> and
secondly that he does not want to finalise the DA documentation until after the
meeting at which Council indicate its views.
 As I have said in the letter to
Dr Quek the danger is that any uncertainty about what the application will
contain will enable Council
officers to resile later from their `agreement' at
the meeting that it is unobjectionable.</b>
<P>

<b>....   Dr Quek has confirmed to me, with some emphasis, that you will be
able to arrange for the preparation of final application
drawings within a day
or so of the proposed meeting.  I am pleased to hear that is possible."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

This made clear that a development application would be pursued.  Of more
significance, in my opinion, was the clear indication
that the plaintiff had
not finalised what was to be built.
<P>

358   	The next facsimile transmission from the solicitors for
the plaintiff to the then solicitors for the Council confirmed that
the
plaintiff intended "to lodge a further development application as a matter of
urgency and certainly within the next few days".
 It continued:-
<P>

<b>"We have previously touched upon our views as to the consequences for
Council and our client of the consent being void.  Those consequences
will be
mitigated if the application is made in a form which meets the requirements of
both our client and Council and is dealt with
expeditiously.</b>
<P>

<b>For that purpose our client requires a meeting with Council officers (with
or without lawyers) to communicate with precision the content
of the proposed
application and to enable Council officers an opportunity to indicate their
views upon the application and to indicate
any changes which they consider
should be made.  Any amendment our client considers necessary can then be made
prior to submission
of the application.</b>
<P>

<b>In view of the gravity of the issues at stake and the extent of likely
losses if further delay occurs, we ask that prompt communication
between our
officers be maintained."</b>
<P>

359   	Both parties sought to rely upon this correspondence.
The Council's point, it being the party tendering the correspondence,
was that
the correspondence made it clear that the plaintiff intended to file a further
development application.  There can be no
doubt about this.  The question was
why there was a necessity to do so.  The plaintiff's submission was that that
arose because of
the challenge to the validity of DA1, which would have
rendered an application under s.102 of no value if DA1 was ultimately found
to
be void.  However, I am of the opinion, based on the evidence of Dr Quek and
the material to which I have referred, that it was
always the intention of the
plaintiff to lodge DA2, rather than to seek to exploit DA1. 
<P>

<b>Conclusions On Causation</b>
<P>

360   	I shall return to the questions posed by the Council,
which I have set forth in paragraph 18.  I am satisfied that the submissions
recorded in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) should be accepted.  I have set
forth my reasons for reaching those conclusions.  I am
also satisfied, for the
reasons I have given, that 102(2) would not have been approved by the Council
if it had been submitted in
March/April 1996 or in October 1996 and that the
Court would not have upheld an appeal against Council's decision.  There is no
reason
to suppose that the Council's attitude to 102(2) would have been any
different in March/April 1996.  Even if an appeal had been brought
from the
determination by the Council by refusal of 102(2), if lodged in March/April
1996, I am not satisfied that it would have
succeeded.  In my opinion, the
consistent refusals of a development until DA4 make it impossible to conclude,
on the balance of probabilities,
that the Court would have approved 102(2) at
any relevant stage.
<P>

361   	My conclusions, as appear from my detailed reasons, are
based on my findings that the plaintiff did not intend to pursue
DA1
development and elected, in lieu thereof, to proceed with DA2 seeking a
substantially similar development.  In the hypothetical
case either situation
put the plaintiff back into the hands of the Council and, therefore,
potentially the Court.  The plaintiff's
determination to maximise the
development was demonstrated by its failure to heed Mr Darroch's advice in
relation to size and bulk,
and Mr Andersons' advice when DA3 was being
prepared.
<P>

362   	For these reasons I consider that the plaintiff would, in
the hypothetical case, have pursued the same course as it did in
the actual
case, with the consequences that DA4 would have been approved when it was.
Accordingly, the plaintiff has not established
that it suffered any substantial
loss as a result of the Council's negligence.
<P>

<b>Award of Damages</b>
<P>

363   	On 1 July 1999 I was furnished with a document entitled
"Revised Summary of Plaintiff's Damages" by the solicitors for the
plaintiff.
The letter stated, inter alia:-
<P>

<b>"We refer to the plaintiff's application made following the hearing in this
matter to have the parties' experts meet to review certain
of the previously
agreed figures provided to Mr Justice Rolfe during the course of the hearing
between 8 and 15 March 1999.</b>
<P>

<b>Pursuant to the granting of that application, the experts have met and the
parties have agreed revised profit figures which are contained
in the Revised
Summary of Plaintiff's Damages.</b>
<P>

<b>The Revised Summary has been marked up for ease of reference so that the
amendments to the original figures, which were contained
in a document handed
up in Court on 15 March 1999 and entitled "Summary of Plaintiff's Damages", can
be readily viewed.</b>
<P>

<b>The revised profit figures which have been agreed upon by the parties are
based upon the revised construction cost figures which are
contained within the
joint statement of the parties' quantity surveying experts which is also
enclosed with this letter.</b>
<P>

<b>The evidence enclosed with this letter concludes the evidence the plaintiff
wishes to submit pursuant to the application detailed
above."</b>
<P>

The letter was also signed by the solicitor for the Council "to indicate the
defendant's agreement to the contents of the attached
documents".
<P>

364   	In the plaintiff's written submissions of 15 March 1999
four different possible situations were put forward, they representing
the
various approaches taken to the case in the way it was fought, and the
financial consequences which would arise depending on
which approach was
adopted.
<P>

365   	The plaintiff's primary position was that development
would have continued on the basis of DA1 modified by s.102(2) without
any
significant interruption.  That assumed that 102(2) would have been submitted
in about March 1996 and approved by the Council
relatively shortly
thereafter.
<P>

366   	This is a submission which I have rejected, and I have
also rejected the further submission subsequently made that there
would have
been an appeal if the Council had refused 102(2), which appeal would have been
successful.  However, if contrary to the
view to which I have come, the view is
taken that the plaintiff has established this position the parties are agreed
that the losses
sustained by the plaintiff would have been the various figures
set forth in the Revised Summary of Plaintiff's Damages, paragraph
1.1, subject
to my acceptance of various evidence.
<P>

367   	In paragraph 1.1.1 the damages are calculated on the
basis that one takes into account the present value of the land, as
Mr Jugmans
did.  For the reasons I have expressed I do not accept Mr Jugmans' methodology
in this regard.  I prefer Mr Bryant's approach
that one looks at the calculated
profit of DA4 and makes no allowance for the "additional unquantified risks
attending" it, on the
basis that the risk factors applied to both
developments.
<P>

368   	Another figure which has to be factored into this
calculation is the appropriate interest rate.  For the reasons I have given
I
prefer the approach that interest be calculated at shareholders' loan rates.
<P>

369   	Applying these two findings, if I were otherwise of the
view that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed on this basis, it
would be
entitled to damages in the sum of $24,840,000 and wasted costs in respect of
the costs of the Class IV proceedings of $224,321.51.
 The entitlement to the
wasted costs is not in issue, it being stated in the Council's written
submissions of 22 March 1999 that
if the Council's primary argument was
accepted "then the plaintiff is entitled to recover its legal costs in respect
of the Class
4 proceedings for DA1, agreed in the amount of $224,321.51".
<P>

The figures to which I am referring and to which I shall refer have interest
calculated to 31 May 1999.
<P>

370   	The second position for which the plaintiff contended was
that the development would have continued based on DA1 as modified
by 102(2),
but with an interruption so that building work did not commence until 1 June
1997.  For the reasons I have given I reject
this contention.  However, if it
is one which finds favour elsewhere the agreed figures are, on the basis of the
same determinations
which I have made in respect of the first position, a loss
of $13,084,000 together with the wasted costs figure.
<P>

371   	The third position put forward by the plaintiff was the
Council's primary position, namely that there would have been no
development in
accordance with DA1 and 102(2), and that the only development would have been
carried out pursuant to DA4.  That,
in my opinion, is the correct
conclusion.
<P>

372   	The plaintiff has conceded that on this basis there is no
loss of profit claim and, therefore, no loss of opportunity claim,
but it asks
for damages representing the costs incurred by it referable to DA2 and DA3,
which, it submits, were steps reasonably
taken by it in mitigation of its
loss.
<P>

373   	In my opinion the lodging of DA2 and DA3 was not taken in
the context of mitigation of loss, but, rather, as a continuing
attempt by the
plaintiff, in the manner I have described, to obtain the type of building it
wanted with as much saleable area as
possible.  They are steps, which would
have been taken, even if there had been no negligence.  In these circumstances
I do not consider
that the plaintiff is entitled to the loss referable to its
submission of DA2 and DA3, but it remains entitled to the wasted costs.
<P>

374   	If, contrary to the view to which I have come, it is
considered that the plaintiff can recover damages on this basis, the
agreed
losses in respect of DA2 are either $6,973,000, if one includes interest at
shareholders' loan rates to date, or alternatively
$6,779,000, if one includes
interest at Supreme Court rates to date.  If I was of the view that the
plaintiff was entitled to succeed
on this claim I would include interest at
shareholders' loan rates.
<P>

375   	So far as DA3 is concerned, the respective figures are
$3,524,000 and $3,424,000 and, if I was of the view that the plaintiff
was
entitled to succeed on this part of the claim I would have awarded
$3,524,000.
<P>

376   	The fourth position is the Council's fallback position,
with which it is unnecessary to deal further.  The figures appear
in the
schedule to which I have referred if, at any future stage, this is thought to
be the appropriate amount.
<P>

377   	In the result I am of the view that the plaintiff is
entitled to its wasted costs of the Class IV proceedings in the sum
of
$224,321.51 with interest from 1 June 1999.  The parties will have to calculate
the amount based on my findings as to the appropriate
rate.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

378   	The parties agreed that I should not, at this stage, make
any order for costs.  I shall, accordingly, reserve that matter
for future
agreement or argument.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

379   	I order:
<P>

(a)	Judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $224,321.51 with interest from 1
June 1999.
<P>

(b)	Costs and interest be reserved for future agreement or argument.
<P>

(c)	Matter stood over to Friday, 16 July 1999 for mention on the issues of
interest and costs.
