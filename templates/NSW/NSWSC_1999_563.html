<b>50129/98    Jeogla Pty Limited &amp; ors v RBA Wright &amp; anor</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>	The Proceedings</b>
<P>

1	These are proceedings concerning the sale by the second defendant as receiver
and manager appointed by the first defendant, of
certain properties and certain
livestock.  The proceedings concern four properties.  The first of the
properties was known as `Hernani'.
 The second property was known as `Tiercel'.
The third property was known as `Jeogla'.  The fourth property was known as
`Bald Hills'.
 As a matter of convenience, Hernani and Tiercel which were
adjoining properties, were together referred to as `Hernani' and the
properties
known as Jeogla and Bald Hills were together referred to as `Jeogla'.  Those
descriptions used by witnesses and during
submissions are generally adopted for
the purposes of the Judgment.
<P>

2	Hernani had been owned by Wright family interests since approximately 1923.
It occupied an area of 981 hectares or 2,453 acres.
 It was a grazing property
situate about 12 kilometres north of Ebor, 30 kilometres west of Dorrigo and 90
kilometres east of Armidale.
 Title to the property was unrestricted
freehold.
<P>

3	Jeogla or `Jeogla Station' as it was sometimes called, had been owned by
Wright family interests since 1902.  It was a grazing
property situate
approximately 51 kilometres east of Armidale.  It occupied an area of
approximately 6,286 hectares, namely 15,532
acres.  It was situate
approximately 45 kilometres south-west of Hernani.  Title was unrestricted
freehold.
<P>

4	Jeogla Pty Limited (`Jeogla'), which is the first plaintiff, in its own
capacity and as trustee for the BA Wright Family Trust,
was at all material
times up to November 1998, the proprietor of Jeogla and was at all material
times up to August 1998, the proprietor
of Hernani.  The directors of Jeogla
were Mr RBA Wright and his wife Mrs BA Wright, who are respectively the second
and third plaintiffs
in the proceedings.
<P>

5	Bald Hills Pty Limited which is the fourth plaintiff, was at all material
times up to November 1998, the registered proprietor
of Bald Hills.
<P>

6	Jeogla was at all material times up to August 1998, in its own capacity and
as trustee for the Wright Family Trust, the proprietor
of Tiercel.
<P>

7	On 1 December 1997, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (`the
Bank') which is the first defendant, appointed Mr
Keith William Skinner (`Mr
Skinner' or `the receiver and manager') who is the second defendant, as
receiver and manager of Hernani
and of all livestock and plant and equipment
located on or used in connection with the operations of Hernani.
<P>

8	On 1 April 1998, the Bank appointed the receiver, as receiver and manager of
Jeogla and of all livestock, plant and equipment
located on or used in
connection with the operations of Jeogla.
<P>

9	The property, Hernani, was sold for $1.1million by contracts exchanged on 20
April 1998.  That contract did not include as a parameter
thereof, the cattle
then running on Hernani.  That cattle was sold on or about 16 June 1998 for the
sum of $195,983 to the purchaser
of the Hernani property.  That sale was at a
price of 77cents per kilogram live weight.
<P>

10	On 22 September 1998 contracts were exchanged for the sale of Jeogla.  This
occurred after the property had been passed in at
auction and following
negotiations which then ensued with the highest bidder.  The contract included
a right of first refusal to
the purchaser in respect of the purchase at a
predetermined price, of the cattle then on Jeogla.  That right of first refusal
was
exercised.  The land component of Jeogla was sold for $5,75million [being
$4.5million as to Jeogla and $1.25million as to Bald Hills]
and the cattle was
sold (subject to stock count) pursuant to the exercise of the right of first
refusal for $1,735,300.00.  The sale
was completed in late October or early
November 1998.
<P>

11	The central issue in the proceedings involves whether the Bank or Mr Skinner
breached its/his relevant duty to the plaintiffs
under section 420A of the
Corporations Law in exercising the power of sale by selling:
<P>

	(a)	the cattle situated on Hernani;
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	the Jeogla property;
<P>

<i>	</i>(c)	the cattle situated on the Jeogla property;
<P>

12	The construction of section 420A Corporations Law is raised as a question of
principle.  That section provides as follows:
<P>

	<i>`420A(1)	In exercising a power of sale in respect of property of a
corporation, a controller must take all reasonable care to sell
the property
for:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	if, when it is sold, it has a market value - not less than that market
value;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	otherwise - the best price that is reasonably obtainable, having regard
to the circumstances existing when the property is sold.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	Nothing in subsection (1) limits the generality of anything in section
232.'</i>
<P>

13	A number of questions as to the proper construction of the section are
raised.  One such question is whether the section imposes
upon a mortgagee a
duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the property is sold at not less
than market value.  The defendants
contended that upon its proper construction
the section did not contain such a duty.  [Submissions 30 April 1999, paragraph
2]  However,
whether or not the section imposed a duty of reasonable care to
obtain market value or a lesser duty of good faith in accordance
with section
420A(1)(b), the defendants contended that they had satisfied the relevant
tests.
<P>

14	The plaintiffs' case is that there was at all material times, an extremely
valuable breeding herd running on Jeogla Station and
conveniently managed by
being situate upon Jeogla and Hernani.
<P>

15	The herd is said to have been dedicated to the beef-maker line of cattle,
being a distinctive sub-set of the Hereford breed built
up by selective
breeding over 100 years to generate the current version of the herd.
<P>

16	There was no real issue but that the herd had an impeccable background and
as I understood it, reputation.  That this was the
case seems clear at the
least from the history which was not in contention, set out as part of the
information memorandum circulated
in advance of the Jeogla auction.  That
information memorandum at page 3 states inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`In 1899 Charlotte May [Wright] [Richard Wright's great grandmother] bought
Wallamumbi Station - 6,070 hectare (14,987 acres) property,
25 kilometres south
of Wongwibinda, and in 1902 purchased `Jeogla Station' - 5,677 hectares (14,017
acres), which joins Wallamumbi
on the eastern side.  Wallamumbi at that stage
was 5,668 hectares (13,995 acres).</i>
<P>

<i>	In 1827 the late George Wyndham (great-grandfather of Richard Wright)
imported to Australia 5 cows and 1 bull - the first Hereford
cattle on the
Australian mainland. </i>
<P>

<i>	Apart from the importation of 5 females from the famous Treworgan Stud,
United Kingdom, in 1952, no females have been introduced
to the stud for more
than 100 years.</i>
<P>

<i>	Following one of the many family splits, the management of `Jeogla Station'
became the responsibility of the late Bruce Wright, a
partner of PA Wright
&amp; Sons.</i>
<P>

<i>	During the 1970's the need for greater production efficiency prompted the
development of Beefmaker cattle by Richard and his uncle,
David Wright.</i>
<P>

<i>	At the same time the Jeogla Hereford Stud was formed as an offshoot of the
Wallamumbi Hereford Stud.</i>
<P>

<i>	The V1V Hereford Beefmakers maintain their reputation of consistent premium
prices from high quality cattle underpinned by quality
assurance.  "Jeogla
Station" was the first cattle operation in Australia to be accredited under the
National Cattlecare Programme
and was also one of the first cattle operations
to obtain quality assurance accreditation under ISO9002.</i>
<P>

<i>	The quality assurance programme ensures that the cattle are beyond reproach
in respect of chemical residues, bruising, hide damage
minimisation and best
practice management.  `Jeogla Station" has introduced a "cell grazing system"
designed to enhance quality pasture
but with the added benefit of constant
education of young cattle in preparation for sale.  Consequently apart from
genetic selection
for good temperament the environment and management practices
are such that the value-adding potential is maximised for back grounders
or
feedlotters.  Production females are similarly handled with matron cows all
sold at 8 - 10 years of age P.T.I.C.</i>
<P>

<i>	Over 40 sales have been conducted through on property auction sales on a
regular basis with a broad spectrum of outside support from
centres in all
states of Australia.  In excess of 50,000 head have been marketed in this
way.</i>
<P>

<i>	On March 16, 1998 a further innovation provided spirited competition on a
national basis with the addition of the Computer Aided
Livestock Marketing.  A
total of 1,778 Hereford Beefmaker steers went under the hammer in a sale
described by some sectors of the
media as superb.  All subsequent on-property
sales have integrated CALM.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>The history of the cattle involved goes back some 171 years,
resulting in stock of impeccable genetic background and outstanding
performance</cite><i>.  It is the belief of the "Jeogla Station" management
that the secret of success is extreme quality control, coupled with
comprehensive
and highly accurate descriptions entailing every aspect of the
life of the animals involved.'    </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

17	The herd is said to have comprised over 5,000 head of cattle at any
particular point of time.  It had a substantial value on
any view.
<P>

18	The plaintiffs' case is that upon appointment as receiver and manager as
aforesaid, the receiver found himself confronted with
two properties and either
one or two herds, depending upon how they were dealt with.  The cattle running
upon Jeogla Station and
upon Hernani were from the same genetic pool.
<P>

19	Jeogla, the property, also contained the core and infrastructure of
merchandising, which included sale yards and the Computer
Aided Livestock
Marketing [`CALM'] cattle selling system.  That system allows purchasers all
over the country to bid for livestock
by description.
<P>

20	Local cattle saleyards in Armidale were also generally available.
<P>

21	Cattle were sold also from time to time to particular buyers as part of the
ordinary realisation of the herd and its progeny.
<P>

22	In relation to the head counts which were involved in segments of the
evidence, it is necessary to keep in mind that as one progresses
through the
year, cattle counts will change as a necessary concomitant of the relevant
cycles.  Autumn cattle will drop their young
between approximately March and
May of the relevant year.  Spring cattle will drop their young between
approximately July and September.
 From time to time, the progeny will stay
with the cow [usually for about 7 months before being weaned] - and during
these periods
references are to the cow with calf at foot.  In due course the
weaned cattle become stand alone beasts and are recorded as such.
<P>

23	The plaintiffs' case embraced the proposition that from time to time the
cattle are culled so that production sale stock is obtained.
 This involves
cows who have reached approximately eight years old;  heifers not considered as
a sufficiently good line for retention
as breeding animals, bulls and steers
who are not considered desirable for retention as breeding stock and other
bulls that have
stood for example in the breeding cycle for approximately one
year.
<P>

24	The plaintiffs' case is that incidental to the breeding programme, was the
production of cross-breed cattle with a Jersey strain
in such cattle.  This
occurred, the Court was informed, because it was the practice to mate heifers
retained in the breeding herd
in their first year with Jersey bulls.  The
resultant calf is smaller than a full sized calf.  A crop of `Jersey crosses'
which are
the result, then require to be sold off.
<P>

25	Generally over time, the headcount of the herd is said to remain relatively
constant, as does the age cycle.
<P>

26	The plaintiffs claim that the herd was in effect a `beef generating machine'
and one which has had applied to it substantial
science and which, in refining
over the years the characteristics of the cows and bulls, has led to a very
high quality herd.  Cows
forming part of the herd have a high level of
fertility.  The bulls and cows in the herd are said to produce cattle with a
confirmation
that optimises the amount of beef available from the carcass.
<P>

27	The case was put in opening by Mr Cotman SC as one raising as the principal
issue the question of how the receiver ought to have
dealt with the herd for
the purpose of sale.
<P>

28	Mr Cotman submitted that the receiver had had in his hands two assets of
substantial value.  The first was the land.  The second
was the breeding
herd.
<P>

29	It was common ground that during the period of the receivership, in addition
to the sales the subject of the proceedings, the
usual production sales
continued.
<P>

30	The plaintiffs emphasised that there had been created on Jeogla, a selling
facility for the sale by auction on-site of cattle
and the CALM purchase
participation.
<P>

31	Mr Cotman submitted in opening that the receiver had in his hands a very
large herd being, in effect, a beef producing facility
and that this was quite
distinct from the product of a beef producing factory.
<P>

32	The submission was that having been selected and assimilated into the
breeding herd, the receiver had on hand a group of cows
and bulls which had
particular characteristics.  These were animals with a fourfold cachet in the
market.  First, there was the fact
that any particular animal was the product
of this particular herd.  Secondly, there was the fact that this was V1V
branded cattle.
 Thirdly, there was the fact that the produce was certified as
a product of a property which, as to management practice, breeding
practices
and beef producing practices, had quality assurance practices resulting in
ISO9002 certification.  Fourthly, the particular
cattle care progeny was
certified by the cattle care certification.
<P>

33	Mr Cotman submitted that the herd had an objectively verifiable history both
as to its genetics and as to its management.  Each
of these were said to have
interacted to give the product of the herd a standing in the market that was
relatively unique.
<P>

34	Mr Cotman put that in relation to the property which was in the receiver's
hands, this could be exploited in a number of different
ways.  Ultimately, the
Hernani cattle had been sold at 77cents per kilo live weight.  The Jeogla
cattle had been treated with differently.
<P>

35	A dispersal sale differs from a production sale in that it involves the
dispersal of a large herd either in one line or in sub-sets
comprising of stand
alone breeding cattle.
<P>

36	Mr Cotman submitted that one was able to present to the market the herd
presenting as its principal attribute, the fact that
it was the machine which
drove the property.  His submission was that what the receiver was selling was
the future production of
the cattle.  The submission was that a significant
value was present being inherent in all the attention, expense and time that
had
been spent in bringing to a very sharp focus, the genetic qualities of the
beasts, being management time and attention devoted to
bringing to that point
the chemical-free management which had optimised production and quality of the
beef produced.
<P>

37	Mr Cotman in his opening submissions, asserted that the first obvious choice
was to sell the land and the cattle separately,
the cattle being sold by
dispersal sale.  The second obvious choice was to deal with the cattle as
integrated into the sale of land
transactions.  In relation to the so-called
integrated approach, the choices Mr Cotman put were first, to sell the land and
to give
the purchaser of the property, a right of first refusal to purchase the
cattle at a defined and predetermined price.  The further
option was to sell
the land and to give a right of first refusal to the purchaser of the property,
but at no defined price.
<P>

38	There are plainly various advantages and disadvantages in pursuing these
alternative options.  A proper understanding of those
advantages and
disadvantages and of the approach of the receiver in the context of the advice
he received as to those advantages
and disadvantages, is at the heart of the
issues litigated.
<P>

39	The ultimate decision of the receiver was that Jeogla should be offered for
sale by auction and the purchaser given a right to
acquire the cattle at a
predetermined price.
<P>

40	In opening, Mr Cotman stated that the plaintiffs' principal complaint was
that there was never any solicitation of the market
in relation to the cattle
herd on Jeogla in whole, or in breeding units, to decide what prices could be
obtained through a dispersal
sale of the herd, sold in its coherent form, or
sold through subsets of stand alone breeding sections.  His submission was that
this
suggested `dispersal sale market' for the herd, was simply not enquired
into.  Mr Cotman opened the plaintiff's case on the basis
that the evidence
would prove that the sale price achieved for the sale of the Jeogla cattle,
following the exercise by the purchaser
of the Jeogla property of the right of
first refusal, was a sale price based on saleyard appraisal figures of July
1998.  In short,
the evidence would prove that the cattle purchase price
achieved for the sale of the cattle on Jeogla was far short of the `dispersal
sale market value' of such cattle, such market value being the best and highest
value in the appropriate market for the herd
<P>

41	Mr Cotman asserted that on the evidence, the appraisal prices upon which the
sale prices were based, would be shown to have sprung
out of saleyard figures,
`as if elements of the herd from time to time had been sent into the saleyards
to be sold through the pens
as, in effect, common or garden sales or sales of
one-off cattle'.  The plaintiff's case was that the appraisal process was not
based
upon a price or value that sprang out of any attempt to explore what was
the market worth, on a dispersal basis, of such a valuable
herd.

58	By Summons filed on 4 July 1997, the Bank commenced proceedings in the
Commercial Division of the Court number 50153 of 1997.
<P>

	<b>1 September 1997 - The September Deed</b>
<P>

59	On 1 September 1997, a further Deed was entered into between the Bank,
Jeogla, Miribel, Aralon, Bald Hills and Mr and Mrs Wright.
<P>

	<b>7 November 1997 - Hernani and Tiercel put to Auction</b>
<P>

60	On 7 November 1997, the Hernani and Tiercel properties were put to auction
by the Wrights.  The property was passed in at the
auction.
<P>

	<b>28 November 1997 - Jeogla Group Default under September Deed</b>
<P>

61	On 28 November 1997, the Jeogla Group defaulted under the September Deed.
<P>

62	On about 28 November 1997, the receiver received a copy of a report dated 24
November 1997 prepared by Chris Meares of Meares
&amp; Associates who acted as
agents for Jeogla on the sale of Hernani.  [KWS4]  The report generally dealt
with the status of the
marketing campaign in respect of the Hernani Station.
<P>

63	It is generally unnecessary to detail the circumstances in relation to which
the receiver went about approaching the auction
of Hernani as the plaintiffs no
longer press their claim in the proceedings in relation to the sale of that
property.
<P>

	<b>1 December 1997 - The Bank appoints a Receiver and Manager over Hernani and
Tiercel</b>
<P>

64	By appointment dated 1 December 1997, the Bank appointed the second
defendant as receiver and manager of the properties known
as Hernani and
Tiercel.
<P>

65	At the time of the receiver's appointment on 1 December 1997, he was aware
that Hernani had been offered for sale by public auction
by Jeogla on 7
November 1997.
<P>

	<b>11 December 1997 - Judgment  entered in favour of the Bank for
possession</b>
<P>

66	On 11 December 1997, Judgment was entered in favour of the Bank for
possession of the properties Hernani, Tiercel, Warrabah,
Jeogla, Bald Hills,
Richardsons Arcade and 122 Dumaresq Street, Armidale.
<P>

	<b>15 December 1997 </b>
<P>

67	On 15 December 1997, settlement of the Warrabah property took place.
<P>

	<b>15 January 1998 - Auction Agency Agreement - Hernani</b>
<P>

68	On 15 January 1998 an Auction Agency Agreement was entered into in respect
of the property Hernani.
<P>

	<b>January 1998</b>
<P>

69	The marketing of the Hernani property commenced in January 1998.
<P>

	<b>6 March 1998 - Hernani and Tiercel are put to Auction</b>
<P>

70	On 6 March 1998, the receiver put Hernani and Tiercel to auction.  The
properties were passed in at the auction and the highest
bid was $875,000.  The
receiver had set the reserve price in consultation with the Bank at
$1,415million.
<P>

71	After the property was passed in, the receiver had discussions with Mr Frank
Spilsbury of Elders who had been acting on the sale.
 Mr Spilsbury told the
receiver that the bids that were made at the auction were a reflection of the
current market and that it was
his view that neither the absence of the
Forestry Lease, nor knowledge of the Wright's financial difficulties, had had
any material
effect on the bidding.  [The reference to the Forestry Lease was a
reference to a lease held by Wright interests over land adjacent
to Hernani.]
The receiver asked Mr Spilsbury to continue to negotiate with any of the
interested parties with a view to getting the
price up to or in excess of the
reserve and Mr Spilsbury said that he thought the reserve was too high.
<P>

	<b>19 March 1998</b>
<P>

72	Elders at Armidale prepared on 19 March 1998, an estimate of prices for the
cattle on Hernani [KWS 22].  The estimate is appended
to the Judgment as
Appendix 1.
<P>

	<b>31 March 1998 - Default</b>
<P>

73	31 March 1998 had become a defined date for the purpose of paying a segment
of the debt under the Deed.  Default took place when
the payment was not
made.
<P>

	<b>1 April 1998 - Receiver and Manager Appointed to Assets and Undertakings of
Jeogla Pty Limited including Bald Hills and Jeogla Station</b>
<P>

74	On 1 April 1998, the second defendant was appointed receiver and manager of
all the assets and undertakings of Jeogla Pty Limited
in its own capacity and
as trustee of the BA Wright Family Trust including the properties Bald Hills
and Jeogla Station.  The appointment
did not cover those assets in respect of
which the second defendant had been appointed receiver and manager on 1
December 1997.
<P>

75	Following the early April 1998 appointment, the receiver had discussions
with Mr Richard Braham who had been employed by Jeogla
as manager of Jeogla
Station.  The receiver also reviewed Mr Braham's curriculum vitae and formed
the view that Mr Braham had the
appropriate expertise to manage the properties
on his behalf and employed Mr Braham to do so.
<P>

	<b>2 April 1998</b>
<P>

76	On about 2 April 1998, the receiver met with Mr Warren Dellow whom he was
aware was interested in purchasing Hernani.  Prior
to this meeting, Mr Dellow
had made an offer to purchase the property at $1,050,000 and had also offered
to purchase the livestock
on the property at a price of 0.63cents per kilogram
live weight.  At the meeting in early April, Mr Dellow increased his price for
Hernani to $1.1million but would not increase his offer for the livestock.  Mr
Dellow advised the receiver that this was his final
offer and that if the
receiver did not accept the offer he was moving to purchase another property.
Mr Dellow agreed to keep his
offer open for a further five days whilst the
receiver sought bank approval or otherwise for the sale.  The receiver asked Mr
Dellow
to formally submit his offer through Elders.  That offer was submitted
formally.  [Elders' letter of 6 April 1998 submitting the
offer - KWS 24]
<P>

77	The receiver formed the view that the offer of $1.1million represented the
market value for Hernani at the time.  In the light
of the fact that the
plaintiffs no longer press their case in respect of the sale of the Hernani
property, it is unnecessary to summarise
the evidence of the receiver as to the
basis for this view which he formed 
<P>

	<b>20 April 1998 - Contracts for Sale of Hernani exchange</b>
<P>

78	On 20 April 1998, contracts for the sale of Hernani were exchanged.  The
livestock running upon Hernani was not sold as part
of the transaction.  The
purchase price of $1.1million obtained, did not include the livestock.  The
contract is to be found at KWS
25.
<P>

79	Following the sale of the property Hernani, the receiver and Mr David
McCarthy of the receiver's office, had various negotiations
with Mr Dellow in
relation to the sale of livestock located on Hernani.  Mr Dellow eventually
made the final offer of $0.77cents
per kilogram on an `as is where is' basis,
which meant that the receiver did not have to pay agents' commission and
associated costs,
freight and freight insurance.
<P>

	<b>8 May 1998</b>
<P>

80	By letter from Elders to the receiver dated 8 May 1998 [KWS 26], Elders (Mr
Maddigan), wrote to the receiver advising that Mr
Maddigan and Mr Spilsbury had
inspected the listed cattle on Hernani on 1 May 1998 and that Mr Maddigan had
found the cattle to be
`generally in a forward to prime condition, with the odd
beast showing a degree of lightness due to age, disease or a genetic
problem'.
<P>

81	The letter advised that the spring 1996 heifers were small framed whilst
quite healthy.  Mr Maddigan believed this to be from
lack of improved pasture
feed in their early growing stages.
<P>

82	Mr Maddigan stated:
<P>

	<i>`I have put an estimate on prices based on the Armidale sale on 7 May 1998
(market report attached).'</i>
<P>

83	Mr Maddigan also included with the letter the offer from Mr Dellow and
stated that he had put his estimate of price `on these
and the net price'.
<P>

84	The enclosures to this letter are appended to the Judgment as Appendix 2.
<P>

	<b>Late April - Early May 1998</b>
<P>

85	In late April and early May 1998, the receiver asked three rural property
agents to prepare marketing submissions for the sale
of Jeogla Station [Jeogla
and Bald Hills].  The agents were Elders who had been the agents appointed by
the receiver on the sale
of Hernani, Meares &amp; Associates who were the
agents engaged by Mr and Mrs Wright and Jeogla Pty Limited on the marketing and
sale of Hernani in October and November 1997, and LJ Hooker Rural, who were
known to the receiver as experts in the sale of rural
properties.
<P>

86	On 8 May 1998, Mr McCarthy accompanied Mr Spilsbury and Mr Hamersley from
Elders Rural on an inspection of Jeogla.  On 13 May
1998, Mr McCarthy
accompanied Mr Nolan from LJ Hooker Rural and Mr P Watts from PR Watts &amp;
Co, Armidale, on an inspection of
Jeogla.
<P>

	<b>Mid-May 1998 - The Hooker's Marketing Action Plan</b>
<P>

87	On 14 May 1998, LJ Hooker Rural submitted a marketing action plan to the
receiver [KWS 28].  The plan included the following:
<P>

	<i>`On Wednesday 13 May 1998 Paul Watts of PR Watts &amp; Co, Armidale, and
David Nolan of LJ Hooker Rural - Sydney inspected the prestigious
and very well
known Armidale District property, "Jeogla Station" . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	The VIV brand and the ISO accreditation should also be included in the sale
together with mention of the availability of on-going
management.</i>
<P>

<i>	We would recommend the livestock and plant and equipment be included in the
sale of the property as a separate item.  </i><cite>A detailed livestock
schedule with values would be prepared and be included in the information
memorandum</cite><i>.  The successful purchaser of "Jeogla Station" would then
be given </i><cite>first right of refusal to purchase the livestock</cite><i>.
This recommendation would also apply to the plant and equipment . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Opinion of Market Value</cite>
<P>

<i>	After our inspection of the property, taking the above into consideration
and carrying out our due diligence in relation to the property
market values in
the Armidale and surrounding districts, together with the overall market for
large scale holdings in New South Wales,
we are of the opinion the market value
of "Jeogla Station" for the land and improvements is between $5,250,000 -
$5,750,000.</i>
<P>

<i>	The above values are our opinion of the present day market place and are
not to be misconstrued as a formal valuation.</i>
<P>

<i>	NB  We would suggest </i><cite>a premium could be achieved</cite><i> over
and above our opinion </i><cite>should the property be promoted in a
professional manner to the widest possible</cite><i> market.'   </i>[Emphasis
added]
<P>

88	Under cross-examination, Mr Skinner gave evidence that at the time he
received this marketing action plan, there was already
active in his mind as an
issue whether to offer Jeogla with or without the livestock.  [T203]
<P>

89	Mr Skinner's evidence was that as he understood it, Hookers recommendation
in its marketing action plan was that a detailed livestock
schedule with values
would be prepared and be included in the information memorandum, this to be
disclosed as being the price at
which a right of first refusal could be
exercised by the purchaser of the land.  [T204]
<P>

90	Not only did Mr Skinner accept that Hookers had in their marketing action
plan referred to selling the land with the cattle included
at a nominated price
disclosed in the information memorandum, [T207]  but he also answered as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And you assume, I take it, that the price that would be nominated in
the information memorandum would be as close as possible
to market price for
the cattle didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I believe so yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So that in effect, as you understood it, the cattle were priced neutral,
save as to their availability to the purchaser of the
land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A..	Yes.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T207]
<P>

91	The receiver accepted that he had understood that what Hookers were saying
was that they did not want to discount the cattle,
or put a premium on the
cattle, and that the cattle should be offered at market value, so that a
purchaser of the land, if the purchaser
wished, could `have a going concern
business, buy the land and obtain the cattle at fair market value'.
[T208.5]
<P>

92	Mr Skinner's evidence was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You are saying, as I understood it, the figure that Hookers were
talking about was a figure for the land sold with the prospect
of being a going
concern, because of the option to take up the cattle at market price?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It is also then self evident, is it not, that if in fact you have
mispicked the nomination of the price of the cattle and you
are now, for
example, significantly below market with the price you have nominated, would
you expect that you would still get effectively
the correct dollars because the
person would up their bid for the land if they wanted the cattle and the
land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Conversely, if you had pitched the price too high a person might buy the
land and simply say "I'm not going to take up the cattle
at that price.  I'll
go into the market and buy them at a dispersal sale of the cattle"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T208-209]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Late April/early May 1998 - The Elders Rural Marketing
Submission</b>
<P>

93	A marketing submission was prepared and submitted to the receiver by Elders
Rural in late April/early May [KWS 29].   Under the
heading `Executive
Summary', the marketing submission stated, inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Consideration is also given to the marketing of the property with the
cattle herd as part of that marketing.'</i>
<P>

94	The Executive Summary also stated that the estimated selling price for the
property was in the range of $6.48million to $7.25million
without stock or
plant and that given the right conditions, a premium price above that figure
could be achieved.  It recommended
a marketing programme `to ensure that the
property received maximum exposure in the marketplace'.
<P>

95	At page 8 of the Elders' Marketing Submission, the recommended marketing
campaign is dealt with, inter alia, in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>`We believe a marketing campaign should focus on an auction for say
mid-August, possibly Wednesday 12th or perhaps later that month.
 The reason
for this time frame centres around a time which pre-spring in the New England
while other areas of the tablelands are
about to go into the spring.</i>
<P>

<i>	We would anticipate, particularly if the current weather patterns continue,
that is the breakdown of the El Nino, a general improvement
in seasonal
conditions.  We believe the demand for cattle will be strong this coming spring
and summer because of the drop in numbers
caused by the drought.  A general
feeling of anticipation can be captured at this time rather than waiting or
running the risk of
the season going off . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	For a proposed auction date 12th August it would be necessary to commence
the promotion the week of 29th June.</i>
<P>

<i>	Promotion material would need to be prepared early in June at least after
the cattle sale at Jeogla on 22 May.  Also the Elders Rural
Property Album
deadline for July is 23rd June.</i>
<P>

<i>	As part of the marketing campaign consideration needs to be given to the
overall presentation of the properties.  We believe we have
a unique
opportunity to capitalise on the industry recognition of the 171 years of
Hereford Breeding, the V1V brand recognition together
with the outstanding
quality of the herd.</i>
<P>

<i>	Plant will be minimal because of the grazing nature of the property.  A
clearing sale therefore would not have much to offer so it
would be best to
include the plant.  . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Livestock values nominated in the contract either at a set figure
or a range in which the buyer can nominate his values</cite><i>.  If values
have changed much between nomination and exchange then the purchaser can adjust
his bid in the land component.  A full
count on delivery with numbers adjusted
at contract value plus or minus which will alter settlement gross.</i>
<P>

<i>	We believe it would be highly desirable to present the property
</i><cite>as a full commercial trading enterprise</cite><i> with disclosure of
trading figures.  These figures will need careful study to determine whether
the bottom line will enhance or assist
in the final sales figure to be achieved
for the asset.'    </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

96	Mr Skinner's evidence under cross-examination as to his understanding,
having read this marketing submission, included the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Do I understand you to have understood that to mean that if your
nominated price for the cattle ends up being too low relative
to the market at
the time of the auction, it doesn't matter because that would be picked up in
the bid for the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well it could be either way.  If the price was too high then they would
probably discount the value of the land as well, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Or simply not take up the option to take up the cattle at the price
nominated?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, the purchaser could have just bid for the land with no intention of
buying the livestock, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If the livestock was well in excess of market value you would expect a
purchaser to say buy the land and not take up the option
to buy the livestock
thinking they can do better by just buying the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Other than its an auction sale, if someone takes a different view it
could increase.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That's the risk of thinking that way?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But the real risk of [sic] your point of view, in terms of an under
realisation of the cattle, was that if you fixed the price
of the cattle in
advance of the auction sale and the market moved up you would want to be
satisfied that you had a mechanism to pick
up that increase through the land
sale, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I've considered that selling the land and livestock together as a
business normally achieves the best price - not just livestock
- any business.
And the mechanism that we put in place enabled someone to bid with confidence
that they could pay their assessment
of the combined value, irrespective of how
its apportioned and that that would give us the best price in the market
place.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Right.  But you understood that you might also have to give
consideration to selling the components separately didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh, that was quite - it was one alternative that could have occurred,
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because the property you were selling was suitable not only for cattle,
it was also suitable for sheep, for cropping, for mixed
farming, a number of
different uses wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was, but I understand the best use of it was for grazing.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But certainly the range of purchasers that you have been told might be
interested in this property may include people who had
no interest in taking
over the cattle herd and running it as a beef grazing property?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That was always a possibility, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And indeed, as you understood the advice that you were receiving, the
property had an intrinsic worth simply because it could
be used for a number of
different grazing and farming activities in various permutations and
connotations?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I wouldn't hold myself out to be an expert to be able to be
precise as to how to value a property with all those alternative
uses.  My
understanding from reading the valuations and the other information I got from
the respective agents was that, yes, there
were alternative uses for the
property.  Without exception I think they all said that the best use and most
value was its grazing
and that was the extent of my understanding of the
respective values.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T205-206]
<P>

97	At page 12 of the Elders' Marketing Submission the following appears under
the head `Estimated Selling Price':
<P>

	<i>`In assessing the likely final sales figure for the combined submission of
Jeogla Station and Bald Hills we are conscious of the fact
that there is no set
value for any piece of real estate whatever it is or wherever it is.</i>
<P>

<i>	For the purpose of marketing these properties it is however extremely
important to work within a reasonable range of values that
will be part of the
overall strategy to achieve the best price possible, having made known the
availability of the submission.  Comparable
sales in this New England area of
similar sized properties are just not available as none have been made.</i>
<P>

<i>	We can however justify the use of a dry sheep equivalent price for similar
land, cleared, improved and pastured with a fertilizer
history.  These figures
are for a fenced and watered property with the above attributes.</i>
<P>

<i>	This figures is in the range of $115 to $120 per dry sheep equivalent area.
We would convert to a cow area by using the ratio of
12 sheep to 1 cow and calf
area.  Using this method we can either calculate the recent stocking levels to
a total DSE multiplied
by the price range, and add the value of the buildings
for a resultant figure.</i>
<P>

<i>	If we said the reasonable current stocking rate was a total of 4,300 cows
with say 80 bulls this would produce a total DSE of 52,400.
 Multiplied by say
$115 plus the improvements at $818,000 gives a</i><cite> figure of
$6.8million</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	We could do the same exercise using a value for a cow area or the same
exercise using the D.S.E. value factor of $120 which would
give us a figure of
$7.1million.</i>
<P>

<i>	It would appear the annual performance of the property would range form
7D.S.E. per hectare during the winter to 9D.S.E. per hectare
during the summer.
We are well aware of the opportunity stocking that can be pursued during the
summer period on improved New England
pastures to augment and expand on cash
flow.</i>
<P>

<i>	In summary we therefore believe the final sales figures will be in the
range of from $6.48million to $7.25million without stock and
plant.
</i><cite>If we add the possible value of the cow herd alone at say an average
of $400 per head this produces a figure of $1.72million</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[KWS29 at page 12]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

98	Mr Skinner's further cross-examination on this document appears at
transcript 211-213.
<P>

99	Mr Skinner was then asked whether he was concerned at all that Elders in
their proposal in relation to the sale of Jeogla, appeared
to be nominating a
range of values for the cows on Jeogla which was significantly higher than the
range of values for which the Hernani
cows were being appraised also by Elders.
Mr Skinner's answer was:
<P>

	<i>`In the appraisal for selling Jeogla - sorry in the marketing submissions I
didn't put a lot of weight on the values of either the
livestock or the
properties.  I got a valuation or an appraisal of the livestock on Hernani and
I subsequently got one for those
livestock on Jeogla.  Likewise, I got a
valuation of the properties.  That is what I placed emphasis on in terms of
value.  The submissions
from agents - the emphasis is on what they are going to
do or their recommendations in terms of how they go about selling the
particular
assets, how they market them, what resources they've got, what their
ability to penetrate the market is, etc.  I didn't spend a lot
of time nor did
I put a lot of weight on the values that you are referring to.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you put at least this much weight on them, Mr Skinner:  What Meares
and Elders were telling you was that in their view the
commercial herd was a
very valuable component of the properties that you were putting up for
sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That when one looked at it on a stand-alone basis, when one looked as to
the land and as to the cattle, or if you look at the
cattle and the land
together, the cattle had a very substantial value?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct, yes.'    </i>[T216]
<P>

100	Mr Cotman put to Mr Skinner at transcript 217-218, that a very
comprehensive valuation had been obtained from Herron Todd White
with respect
to the land at Jeogla.  He then put the following questions:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Am I right in thinking that the only assessment or review that you
obtained of the value of the herd, either on Hernani or on
Jeogla, were the
letters from Elders and their supporting tabulation of cattle numbers and
amounts that we have seen as at 8 May
in relation to Hernani and I think for 30
July in relation to Jeogla?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't state the exact dates, but yes, it was the two documents that I
got from Elders.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I think I'm being unfair to you insofar as there was one additional
document which was a letter written by Mr Maddigan explaining
the differences
between what was in the Hernani assessment and what was in the Jeogla
assessment.  Do you remember he wrote a letter
in August . . . This was
apparently written on 27 August 1998 from Mr Maddigan to Mr McCarthy.'
</i>[T218]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Early May 1998 - The Meares Marketing Submission</b>
<P>

101	The Meares &amp; Associates marketing submission was prepared on 5 May 1998
and submitted to the receiver under cover of letter
dated 7 May 1998 [KWS 30].
This submission includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`Summary of recommendations</i>
<P>

<i>	Preferred Method and Time of Sale</i>
<P>

<i>	It is recommended that Jeogla Station be offered for sale for auction on
Thursday 12 November 1998 in Sydney.</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale Format</i>
<P>

<i>	The sale will initially include all the land together with the fixed
improvements with livestock, plant and machinery optional.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the first instance, the property would be offered for sale as a whole,
and if unsold then in two portions, namely Jeogla Station
. . . and Bald Hills
. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	An inventory of livestock, plant and machinery will also be drawn up and
made available to successful purchasers.  </i><cite>The valuations for both
livestock and plant would be taken at the commencement of the marketing
campaign at the end of September</cite><i> . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Estimate of Likely Selling Price</i>
<P>

<i>	It is estimated that the current market selling price of the land would
range from $7.5million to $8.5million.  Whilst the livestock
have not been
inspected, it is estimated that they could be worth </i><cite>$2million to
$3million</cite><i> with plant and machinery $400,000 to $500,000.  This would
give an overall gross of </i><cite>$10million to $12million</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	At this stage an in depth assessment of current market selling price has

stated inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Today Jeogla Station, which is highly regarded both nationally and
internationally as a leading cattle breeding property, carries
approximately
5,000 principally commercial breeding cows, the progeny of which are mainly
sold through three production sales throughout
the year. . . .</i>
<P>

been the evolution of the Beefmaker breed.  </i><cite>Beefmaker cattle
constantly achieve premium prices as a result of excellent carcass
yields.</cite><i>   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	The purpose of this submission is to recommend a marking strategy which
will allow the vendors to dispose of the land and fixed assets,
the renowned
V1V herd, plant and machinery and maximise the values obtained.</i>
<P>

<i>	As the family name together with the brand names of Jeogla Station and V1V
are internationally known, it will be important to market
the assets both
nationally and internationally . . .'</i>    [KWS30 at page 1]
<P>

103	At transcript 215-216, Mr Skinner under cross-examination in relation to
the Meares Marketing Submission and in particular as
to Mr Meares' estimates
with respect to the livestock, gave evidence that he did not believe Mr Meares
to be a livestock valuer so
that the value which Mr Meares placed on livestock
was, to Mr Skinner's perception, nowhere near what Mr Skinner would place on
the
appraisals that he had received from Elders.  Mr Skinner's evidence was
that `I just didn't consider that valuation in the context
of the cattle.  It
was an indicative price by Mr Meares who had not inspected the livestock.  It
didn't have a lot of weight with
me'.   [T216]

	<b>The Receiver Selects Hooker as Preferred Marketing Agent</b>
<P>

104	The receiver reviewed the respective marketing action submissions and
formed the view that LJ Hooker Rural was his preferred
agent for the marketing
and sale of Jeogla Station.  He recommended to the Bank that he appoint LJ
Hooker Rural as agent, with PR
Watts &amp; Co as their conjunction agent in
Armidale for the following reasons:
<P>

	(a)	The receiver's preference was that the property be sold by an agent based
in the city in conjunction with an agent in the country,
as in the receiver's
experience, city agents were able to market substantial properties to a far
wider audience.
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	The receiver had received favourable references on Mr Nolan from LJ
Hooker Rural from a number of managers in credit units of
leading Australian
banks.
<P>

<i>	</i>(c)	The receiver was satisfied with the LJ Hooker Rural marketing
action plan.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>20 May 1998 - Letter requiring the Wrights to vacate</b>

105	By letter dated 20 May 1998 from Deloittes [PX 680], notification was given
to the Wrights that they were required to vacate
the property within one
month.
<P>

	<b>20 May 1998 - Auction Agency Agreement - L J Hooker (Rural) re
Jeogla</b>
<P>

106	By Auction Agency Agreement entered into on 20 May 1998, LJ Hooker (Rural)
was appointed as agent for the sale of Jeogla.  [KWS
32]  The sale of Hernani
cattle had not yet taken place.  The receiver continued to retain the option of
removing the Hernani cattle
to Jeogla Station for sale together with the cattle
running on Jeogla.  [T202]
<P>

	<b>22 May 1998 - Production sale on Jeogla</b>
<P>

107	On 22 May 1998, a production sale took place on Jeogla.  This was a CALM
sale.  In preparation for the sale, Mr Maddigan had
inspected the livestock in
late April and prepared on 7 May an estimate of prices.
<P>

	<b>The Receiver's Office Prepare a Comparison</b>
<P>

108	At some stage, presumably soon after 22 May1998, Mr McCarthy from the
receiver's office, prepared a document which assessed
Mr Dellow's offer by
comparing it to the Elders' appraisal and the prices achieved at the sale from
Jeogla on 22 May 1998, together
with an assessment of the gross price taking
into account trucking costs and commission if the stock had been sold at
auction.  That
document [KWS 26A] is appended to the Judgment as Appendix 3.
Based on the documents appended to the Judgment at appendices 2 and
3, the
receiver formed the view that the offer from Mr Dellow represented market price
for the Hernani cattle.
<P>

	<b>16 June 1998 - Sale of cattle running on Hernani</b>
<P>

109	On 16 June 1998, an invoice for the sale of the livestock running on
Hernani was sent from the second defendant to the purchaser
of the Hernani
property, Mr Dellow, at a price of 0.77cents per kilogram.  As previously
indicated, the sale of the livestock on
Hernani was not pursuant to any
contractual right reposed in the purchaser of the Hernani property.

<P>

111	On 7 July 1998, LJ Hooker Rural prepared a listing which was approved by
the receiver, being a listing of the media advertising
campaign proposed for
Australian newspapers for the sale of Jeogla.  The proposal covered
advertisements in the Financial Review,
The Land, Queensland Country Life on
dates in August and September 1998.

<i>	</i><b>21 July 1998 - Mr Nolan of Hookers advises as to three alternative
methods of presenting Jeogla Station to the market place</b>
<P>

113	By letter dated 21 July 1998, Mr Nolan of LJ Hooker Rural wrote to the
receiver advising, inter alia, as follows:
<P>

	<i>`As discussed, we are writing in relation to our recommendations for the
livestock on "Jeogla Station" together with additional advertising
and
promotional suggestions.</i>
<P>

<i>	The livestock are critical to the eventual sale of the property.  There are
three obvious ways in which "Jeogla Station" can be presented
to the market
place and these are as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>(a)	Land and Improvements - Cattle sold via a dispersal sale</b></i>
<P>

<i>	This scenario would not be attractive to perspective [sic] purchasers as
they would have to compete with a large field of buyers
at the dispersal sale
or outsource the cattle from other avenues.  As a result they would create
their own premium in the market
as well as finding it nearly impossible to
locate big lines of well bred and proven breeders.</i>
<P>

<i>	Because of the above, prospective purchasers would have to discount their
opinion of the land and improvement value to compensate
for the above livestock
purchases.  In the New South Wales Rural Property Market it would be rare to
find an operation the size of
"Jeogla Station" being sold without the
livestock.</i>
<P>

<i>	We have witnessed in Queensland large scale properties being sold without
the cattle but this has normally been brought about by
existing land owners
looking to buy fattening country for existing livestock they already own.  In
the case of Jeogla Station, it
would be viewed in the market place as
predominantly a breeding property as opposed to being a fattening
property.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>(b)	Land and Improvements - first option of purchasing the cattle herd -
No value given prior to the auction</b></i>
<P>

<i>	In this scenario, potential investors would certainly be hesitant in
purchasing the property without having the knowledge in relation
to the value
of the herd.  The majority of purchasers would feel they could be held to
ransom after they had purchased the property
and therefore they would be in a
similar position to the purchasers in category (a), having to outsource the
cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	As a result of the above, purchasers would make significant discount
allowances when calculating the value of the land and improvements.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>(c)	Land and Improvements and </b></i><b><cite>the cattle herd as an
option at an agreed value</cite></b>
<P>

<i>	There is no doubt this </i><cite>is the most attractive package for
potential investors</cite><i>.  It is also the best method of maximising the
value of the land and improvements.</i>
<P>

<i>	When taking into consideration the value of the land and improvements in
comparison to the value of the herd then it would be sensible
to protect the
value of the property.  By having the first option to purchase the cattle this
will allow potential investors to carry
out their due diligence in a fairly
accurate manner and because of this a premium for the land may be achieved.
The recent media
speculation by Mr Wright (The Land, Thursday 4 June 1998) of
the property including livestock and plant having a value in the vicinity
of
$17million would in our opinion be based on absolutely ridiculous "blue sky"
assumptions.</i>
<P>

<i>	For the record, "Jeogla Station" is a very well known large scale breeding
property running a substantial herd of Herefords [the
word `Beefmaker' in
handwriting appears in this place in the letter, but it is unclear to me
whether it formed part of the letter
as sent] cattle which are also highly
regarded in many quarters.  However while the successful purchaser of "Jeogla
Station" will
take all that into consideration they will also be very mindful
of the overall cost and therefore the future returns based on their
capital
invested.'    </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

114	It is convenient to refer hereafter to the three alternatives put in this
letter as `Alternative (a)', `Alternative (b)' or
`Alternative (c)'.
<P>

115	Mr Skinner accepted that the choice that he made was ultimately to follow
the third of these recommendations, namely to sell
the land and improvements
and the cattle herd as an option at an agreed value.  [T222]
<P>

116	The same letter had included a section dealing with `local and
international marketing' and advised the receiver of further
research carried
out by LJ Hooker Rural on this topic.  LJ Hooker Country and Rural Tasmania had
been contacted as Mr Roly Gibbons
of that branch had been marketing a property
for the Tasman Dairy Company called `Woolnorth'.  This was arguably Tasmania's
most
well known property and had a market value of approximately $12million.
Based on productivity it was a larger holding that Jeogla
Station however
similar in reputation.  Mr Nolan advised the receiver in this letter :
<P>

	<i>`So where the enquiry from overseas came from was most interesting.  Roly
Gibbons had a good response from the UK and Europe via the
Farmers Weekly and
The Country Life.  He found they also received good enquiry from Asia but it
turned out to be very general and
more of a fact finding mission than anything
of any substance . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Roly in summarising all of the above informed us over 95% of his
international enquiry came through prospective purchasers having
their own
representatives in Australia.  Roly also was in agreement </i><cite>the
livestock should be offered to the successful purchaser at an agreed
value</cite><i>.  He also has a substantial list of both Australian and
International investors who he will provide to us in order for the information
on Jeogla Station to be sent.</i>
<P>

<i>	In summary, we as the appointed selling agents would recommend the
livestock be included at a predetermined figure.  In order to
prove an
independent value of the herd then an outside stock and station agency should
be commissioned.  We would recommend Elders
Pastoral be paid to carry out this
valuation.  Elders Pastoral have sold cattle in the past under instructions
from Mr Rick Wright
and this would also help alleviate Mr Wright in trying to
discredit our opinions in relation to the herd's value . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Please find attached our draft advertisement of the forthcoming auction of
Jeogla Station.   . . . Also attached is our recommended
addition to the
already approved advertising budget.  The new budget indicates the cost of two
advertisements in the Weekly Times
in Victoria and also two advertisements for
both the Farmers Weekly and Country Life in the UK.'  </i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[KWS 39]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Receiver approves the Advertising Campaign</b>
<P>

117	In due course the receiver approved an advertising campaign covering the
advertising on 6 August 1997 in the Weekly Times, on
7 August 1997 in Country
Life, on 9 August 1997 in Farmers Weekly, on 13 August 1997 on Weekly Times, on
14 August 1997 in Country
Life and on 15 August 1997 in Farmers Weekly - KWS
40.
<P>

118	Those advertisements were in the same or similar form to the advertisement
earlier detailed in this Judgment to be found at
KWS 38.
<P>

	<b>29 July 1998 - The Receiver Seeks Mr Maddigan's Appraisal</b>
<P>

119	By letter dated 29 July 1998, the receiver wrote to Mr Maddigan in the
following terms:
<P>

	<i>`I . . . seek your services in providing a market appraisal of the
livestock on Jeogla.</i>
<P>

<i>	Jeogla Station is being offered for sale by auction on 22 September 1998
and the successful purchaser of the property will have the
first option to
purchase the </i><cite>livestock at a predetermined price</cite><i> based on
the market appraisal provided by you.  In determining the market appraisal,
please give due consideration to the history
of breeding and identification
with the VIV brand.  Your market appraisal will form part of the contract for
sale of the livestock
and should be in a detailed form setting out your
appraisal on each category and age of livestock.  I understand that a per head
appraisal is the usual approach for livestock of this nature.  However if this
is not the case, please advise the appropriate unit
of valuation.  As the
livestock will be sold in October, your appraisal should reflect your view of
the livestock at that time.'
  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

120	The letter also referred to the Elders' fee for its services and included
the following:
<P>

	<i>`If the livestock is not sold to the purchaser of the property and a
</i><cite>disposal</cite><i> sale is held which is conducted by Elders and West
Farmers Dalgety as co-agents, then I confirm your agreement that the appraisal
fee will be deducted from your agents fee for the sale.'    </i>[KWS 35]
[Emphasis added]
<P>

121	Under cross-examination, Mr Skinner was asked in relation to the above
paragraph in the letter whether he there intended to
refer to a dispersal sale,
that is to say a sale of all the cattle off Jeogla in the event that the
purchaser didn't want to take
them up.  The answer was given as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Yes, it was intended if the purchaser didn't exercise the first right of
refusal or the option, whatever you like to call it, then
insofar as I then
disposed of the livestock by whatever other means, and I hadn't at that stage
limited it to any one particular
means, then the appraisal fee would be a
deduction off the commission that he may have earned, assuming of course, that
I did appoint
Elders to do it.'    </i>[T223]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>1 August 1998 - Marketing of Jeogla commences</b>

122	On 1 August 1998, the marketing of Jeogla commenced.
<P>

	<b>7 August 1998 - Herron Todd White Valuation</b>
<P>

123	On or about 7 August 1998, the receiver received a valuation of Jeogla and
Bald Hills, carried out Robin Gardiner of HTW Valuers
(Dubbo) Pty Limited
[Herron Todd White].  In paragraph 38 of the receiver's affidavit of 1 April
1999, he deposed that he had `relied
on this valuation as representing the
market value of Jeogla'.
<P>

124	In summary, the valuation at page 36, assessed the subject values in the
following terms:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Current market value</cite><i>	(i) Jeogla Station

<i>		a single aggregation	$5,300,000'</i>
<P>

125	On 7 August 1998, Mr Gardiner of Herron Todd White, wrote to the receiver
referring to his valuation of the properties set out
in his report of 5 August
1998 and stating:
<P>

	<i>`The valuation assessments, both fair market values and forced sale values,
would stand if the properties were offered for sale by
the receivers.  Further,
I hereby confirm that you may rely upon my valuation report.'   </i>[KWS 34]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>7 August 1998 - Mr Maddigan's Appraisal</b>
<P>

126	By letter dated 4 August 1998 but received by the receiver on 7 August
1998, Mr Maddigan enclosed his current market appraisal
of the livestock on
Jeogla as requested by the receiver in the receiver's letter of 29 July.  A
value of $1,656,120.00 was given
for all cattle.  Mr Maddigan's letter included
the following:
<P>

	<i>`The livestock . . . were inspected by me on 30 July 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	This market appraisal is at all times subject to market and climatic forces
which can either increase or decrease the estimated price.
 We have estimated
the price on the current market taking into consideration the expected growth
of the cattle for delivery in October
1998.'    </i>`KWS 36]
<P>

The enclosed appraisal is Appendix 4 to this Judgment.
<P>

127	The receiver deposed in paragraph 41 of his affidavit of 1 April 1999 that
he had `relied on this appraisal as representing
the market value for the
cattle'.
<P>

	<b>13 August 1998 - Sale of Hernani and Tiercel Settlement</b>
<P>

128	On 13 August 1998, the sale of the Hernani and Tiercel properties were
settled.

	<b>13 August 1998</b>
<P>

129	A 3-page advertisement appeared in the LJ Hooker Rural Guide issued on or
about 13 August 1998 and an advertisement appeared
on the LJ Hooker Internet
Website from 7 August 1998.  The LJ Hooker Rural Guide advertisement is
appended as Appendix  5.
<P>

130	Mr Skinner deposed in paragraph 45 of his affidavit of 1 April 1999 as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`I relied on the expertise and experience of LJ Hooker Rural in determining
the appropriate marketing programme for the sale of Jeogla.
 I also determined
that I would offer the livestock, and the plant and equipment for sale by
separate contract, and that the purchaser
of Jeogla should be given first right
of refusal to purchase those assets.  In making this determination, I relied on
the recommendation
of LJ Hooker Rural, and my own experience and also had
regard to the recommendation of Elders Rural and Meares &amp; Associates as
noted in their respective marketing submissions.'</i>
<P>

131	Mr Skinner also gave evidence to the effect that the information memorandum
had been provided to any person expressing a serious
interest in purchasing
Jeogla.  That information memorandum is a very detailed document which,
together with the inclusion, covers
some 48 pages.  The first ten pages of the
information memorandum are appended as Appendix 6.
<P>

	<b>22 September 1998 - Auction of Jeogla and Bald Hills Properties</b>
<P>

132	On 22 September 1998, the auction of the Jeogla and Bald Hills properties
took place.  The properties were passed in at the
auction.  Contracts for Sale
were exchanged later that day.  The components of the purchase price were
$5.75million paid for the
property and $1.671million paid for the cattle
running on the property.
<P>

133	The contracts for the sale of livestock provided that the purchase price
was to be adjusted after a stock count carried out
pursuant to clause 8 of the
contract.  Mr Skinner deposed that the prices specified in schedule 1 to the
contract were based on an
appraisal of the stock conducted by Elders as at 30
July 1998 plus an average premium of 13%.  The purchase price for the stock
after
the stock count was $1,671,391.  Of that amount, a deposit of $173,530
had been paid on exchange.

	<b>Witnesses</b>
<P>

<b>	Mr Skinner</b>
<P>

135	Under cross-examination, Mr Skinner accepted that at 29 July 1998, the
drafting of the information memorandum would have been
taking place.  He
believed that he would have instructed his solicitors to prepare the sale
contract but he was not certain at what
stage it then was.  He was then asked
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Leaving aside the contract for the moment, in relation to any brochures
or information memorandum or advertisements, had the selling
process via the
print media started at that point?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't recollect, I'm sorry.  The process - no.  The process was
managed by Hookers.  I just can't be sure from my memory exactly
what stage it
was at.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Had you at this point in time [29 July 1998]</i><cite> decided that the
market appraisal would not be included in the information
memorandum</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, no conscious decision either way at that stage.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, certainly you had Hooker's recommendation that the appraised price
or the price at which the cattle would be sold ought
to be in the information
memorandum . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't recollect.  Certainly, I had been - I knew what their
recommendation was.  Whether that was something I considered when
I wrote this
letter, I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well,</i><cite> as you understood the recommendation, it was as appears
in KWS39 that the potential purchasers should be told "You have an option
and
the option will be at a nominated figure</cite><i>"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's right . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	As you understood what Hookers were saying in the letter to which I
addressed your attention, first of all, purchasers might be
discouraged from
bidding if they thought that they would have to compete to get the cattle in a
dispersal sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not necessarily discouraged from bidding.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well certainly discouraged from bidding their best dollar?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And one of the reasons being that Hooker's view was that purchasers
would be very mindful of the overall cost of the acquisition
and if one element
was uncertain, they couldn't assess the overall cost?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well it takes two elements to be uncertain.  I mean, if there was one
element in addition to the price of the land, yes.  . .
. So that's - it would
be difficult for them to bid with two uncertain elements when they are just
bidding one price, so we had to
- my understanding of it and the way we
proceeded was that we looked in all the elements including the plant and
equipment and the
other assets and left just the one element that was going to
dictate the ultimate price.'     </i>[T224-225]
<P>

136	Mr Skinner was asked under cross-examination whether in deciding to embrace
alternative (c), namely offering the land and improvements
in the cattle herd
as an option at an agreed value, he had any debate with Hookers as to how one
would promote that choice - or promote
that fact to potential purchasers of
Jeogla.  His answer was:  
<P>

	<i>`Not specific to that item.  It was more discussed in terms of information
on the whole package.'</i>
<P>

137	The following evidence was given:
<P>

	<i>Q.	Did you have a recollection at the time that you read this
letter</i><cite> that Hookers had advised you in their proposal to sell . . .
that if the cattle were to be offered with the first option at an agreed
value,
the values ought to be included in the information memorandum</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Not that specifically</cite><i>, I had a number of discussions
with Mr Nolan from Hooker throughout the period that resulted in the process
that we undertook, so
I can't specifically say today that when I read that
letter I related it back to the original proposal.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Certainly as you understood it Mr Nolan considered it
important that a potential purchaser know that any option to purchase the
livestock
was an option at an agreed value before the auction of the
land</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	From the material at page 311 at an agreed value which was itself
disclosed to purchasers or potential purchasers, so that they
could do their
sums or their due diligence, as was put by Mr Nolan about the prospect of
purchasers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't see those words, but </i><cite>yes, it was Mr Nolan's view that
the purchasers had to know the price of the livestock so they could assess what
they were paying
for the land at auction</cite><i>.'   </i>[T228-229]
[Emphasis added]
<P>

138	Under cross-examination at page 231, Mr Skinner was asked in relation to
the information memorandum, where in the document one
found that it was stated
by the receiver through his agents that what he intended to do was to sell the
cattle at an agreed value
in connection or conjunction with the sale of the
land.  His answer was:  
<P>

	<i>`As I said, you're looking at this in isolation from the other information
the prospective purchasers got.</i>
<P>

139	The following evidence was given:
<P>

	<i>Q.	Well </i><cite>the brochures circulated by Hookers, the newspaper
advertisements published by Hookers and others</cite><i>, in effect light
reading, if you like, </i><cite>the first line of advertising, didn't make any
mention of the prospect that the successful purchaser of the land would have
the first
option to buy the cattle at an agreed value, did
they</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No, that's correct.  The advertising didn't and the
information memorandum said there was an opportunity to buy
yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you get the information memorandum, you're told variously that you
have an option or an opportunity to purchase it, but no
reference to "at an
agreed price" . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In the information memorandum in isolation it does not say that price.
The potential purchasers, when inquiring for an information
memorandum, were
provided, where appropriate, the livestock details as well as the other
information they requested on speculative
properties, etc.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The livestock details are given in the information memorandum?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The livestock prices to be precise.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I see.  How was it they were given the livestock prices?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Through Mr Nolan.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So is this right:  If a person, having seen an advertisement or
brochure, was still interested enough to get the information memorandum
and,
having got on information memorandum, they were still interested enough that
they spoke to Mr Nolan, they might then be given
the information concerning the
livestock values, what, as a schedule?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Well, we provided a schedule to Mr Nolan, who I understand
passed it on to prospective purchasers</cite><i>.  It may have been at the same
time as the information memorandum, it may not have been subsequent.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well how did you come to that understanding Mr Skinner?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In discussions with Mr Nolan and Mr McCarthy.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So is this right:  You say that in a discussion you had with Mr Nolan or
Mr McCarthy at some time during the marketing of this
property, it was
considered that - it was discussed that part of the information circulated to
prospective purchasers was the cattle
schedule and values?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, in fact before we settled the schedule, we got Mr Nolan involved to
agree the format and the values, not as a valuer but
. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well where does one find in your affidavit any reference to that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's not in the affidavit.'     </i>[T232]
<P>

140	At transcript 233, it was put to Mr Skinner that it was critical to the
strategy that he had adopted in relation to the sale
of the land that people
unambiguously know that the cattle were being offered as an option to purchase
at an agreed value and he
accepted that this was the strategy.  It was then put
to Mr Skinner as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Because if they didn't know that, they may be dissuaded from being
interested in getting involved at all?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would - a bit more to price than "at all".  If people were interested
in the property, then I think the total absence of a livestock
price would not
have totally dissipated their interest. </i><cite> It may have affected the
price they paid</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>But the advice that you had received from Mr Nolan was if
people thought either they were going to have to compete at a clearing sale
and
merely have an opportunity to buy or have simply an option that may involve
being held to ransom, either of those two situations
would significantly affect
the marketability of the property;  is that right</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Significantly affect the marketability of the property doesn't mean to
say that people won't participate in an auction.  It may
affect their price.
Ultimately it could have either result.  I guess, but my main concern at the
time was the price.'   </i>[T233]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

141	The question which is underlined above was then put again to Mr Skinner and
he was asked whether that was the advice he received.
 His answer was:  `I
can't recall the specific words.  If it's in a document I can check that, but
<u>certainly my recollection of the advice was that without the livestock at a
fixed price, it could affect the price we received for
the property.</u>'
[T233]
<P>

142	At transcript 234, the following was put to Mr Skinner:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	The short answer is . . .  this, Mr Skinner, isn't it, that for
</i><cite>a purchaser to know what he might be up for if he buys the land and
the herd was an important piece of information to decide whether
or not you
could afford to be at the table playing at all, wasn't it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>That's correct.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In other words, the people who might turn up at the auction were those
people who thought they could afford to pay what it was
necessary to get Jeogla
and it's cattle if that's what they were after.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct.'</i>     . . .   [Emphasis added]
<P>

143	Generally Mr Skinner in my view, accepted under cross-examination that
unless the livestock price at which the cattle were to
be offered was known in
advance, a very material piece of information would not have been communicated
to prospective purchasers
or those who might otherwise have been interested in
the purchase.  And at transcript page 235 in being tested on what information
was given to prospective purchasers, Mr Skinner gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	. . . You say that the way in which people might come into possession
of the livestock price was if Mr Nolan gave them a schedule,
not reproduced in
your affidavit and not referred to in your affidavit, as being one distributed
by Mr Nolan which you believe was
being distributed to prospective
purchasers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, that and a lot of other information given to prospective
purchasers.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, the other information given to prospective purchasers was
essentially the cattle numbers and the composition of the herd,
wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, people who inspected the property were given further information.
As in selling any business the information memorandum
is a starting point.
You've then got to cater to whatever the particular requirements of the
potential purchasers might be and provide
what information is
appropriate.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well did you direct Mr Nolan that in relation to people inquiring as to
the prospect of acquiring Jeogla that they should be given
a copy of the
livestock schedule?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Most definitely.'</i>    [T235]
<P>

144	In being tested on whether the livestock schedule which Mr Nolan had been
directed to furnish to interested parties recorded
the price of the cattle in
terms of the market value of the cattle as at July, Mr Skinner's evidence was
that that had been the base
that the price was calculated upon but it was not
the July price.  His evidence was that :
<P>

	<i>`. . . the July price was Mr Maddigan's valuation or appraisal at July and
then with a further factor over and above that that was
arrived at by Mr
Maddigan coming down to Sydney to our office and going through the schedule,
preparing it, discussing potential
market movements and putting an addition
factor over and above his valuation back in July.'</i>  [T235]
<P>

145	Mr Skinner's evidence was that Mr Maddigan's appraisal of 4 August which
had been received by the receiver's office on 7 August
was understood by Mr
Skinner to be an appraisal based on the current price projecting the growth of
the cattle between that point
in time and October.  However, there was more to
the matter. In this regard at transcript 236 and following, Mr Skinner's
evidence
was that the original appraisal of 29 July had the autumn cows valued
at a price but had not separated or assumed that the cattle
were weaned by
October and listed separately.  Hence, discussions which ensued back on a date
in August had involved a necessity
to readjust the schedule and to separate the
weaners out from the cows.  Mr Maddigan had looked again at his valuation.
Certain adjustments
to the figures were made.  Importantly on Mr Skinner's
evidence, these adjustments included `putting a factor over and above Mr
Maddigan's
valuation on the figures that we put into the livestock schedule'.
[T236]
<P>

146	Mr Skinner was then asked as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Well, let's see if we can deal with that.  You of course have said in
your affidavit that the document reproduced behind the letter
is the schedule
as produced by Mr Maddigan?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That was the schedule that accompanied his letter of 4 August.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And is the other schedule to which you are referring the schedule that
was used as to the basis for the September livestock contract?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  Well, no, no sorry, that was a summary of it.  There was a more
detailed summary that we sent to Mr Nolan from recollection.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well where do we find that document in your affidavit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>It's not in this document in this affidavit</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Well if you assume it's not in Mr Nolan's affidavit and it's
not in Mr Maddigan's affidavit where does one find this
document</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Well I have a copy in my files</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well is this the sequence of events.  We've got the Maddigan appraisal .
. . being the document reproduced behind the exhibit
we are now looking at it.
There is some intermediate document prepared in consultation between who,
yourself, Mr Maddigan and Mr
Nolan or?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The process was David McCarthy met with Mr Maddigan over a day or two -
I can't recollect the exact time - and reworked the schedule.
 They sent it to
Mr Watts, PR Watts in Armidale.  He reviewed it as well and made some
recommendations.  And it was also then provided
to Mr Nolan and agreed to by Mr
Nolan.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the final manifestation of this process is, I take it, at least the
first working of the schedule to the September 22 contract,
the precount
version?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, the schedule in the contract reflected the values they arrived at
on that exercise I mentioned.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now, when was it that the document that you've referred to as having
gone through this debate process ultimately came into existence?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>It was finally signed off the second or third week of
August</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>So about a month before the auction</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And so I take it that </i><cite>so far as being able to publish the
price of the cattle, that the cattle would be offered as part of the option,
that could not be
done before the third week of August</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Second or third</cite><i> week.  I can't remember the date,
but yes, that's - within that window.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And is it right that the figure in this reworked document was still
about $1.65,66million?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's the figure that was in the contract.  I - it'll be in one of these
annexures to the contract if I can look at that.  the
livestock contract will
have the figure.  It's about $1.7million . . .'</i>   [T237]
<P>

147	Ultimately, Mr Skinner was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Well, . . . is this right.  That the figure that was being adopted was,
in effect, a what, a guess as to what the market price
might be in September
1998, based on the July prices for the various types of cattle described by Mr
Maddigan in his letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That was the base, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So that you were attempting to project forward in time the physical
state of the cattle herd as it would be in October, the first
component?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And secondly to compute or estimate a market price by reference to the
July prices projected forward to September/October?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  Well as I've said earlier it is very very difficult to forecast
prices.  So whilst on the one hand - well, what we thought
was here is the
valuation which came up by Mr Maddigan.  Assuming there is some uplift in the
market then let's put a factor on the
top, but ultimately I was comfortable
that the sale process that we've described would - even if we haven't put a
factor on - would
result in the equivalent net total proceeds.  So, you know, I
wouldn't profess to be able to say that I can estimate a market price
in three
months' time.  It was a factor we put on to hopefully accommodate, if there was
some lift.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But your assumption was that if you had underestimated the market the
promotion of the sale of the land in connection with the
herd would be such
that any discount in the price of the herd against prevailing market prices in
September would be picked up in
the bid price for the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Basically yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>That of course assumes that all persons interested in the
Jeogla land cattle combination have been persuaded to attend the auction
by the
promotion of an auction with the cattle at a nominated price doesn't
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes they'd have to be aware of the price beforehand
yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>And if the promotion of the sale did not bring to their
attention, either the fact that there was an option at an agreed price, or
that
there was in fact an agreed price of $1.6 or $1.7million, material information
was not being communicated to the correct place;
 is that right?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>If we hadn't told the potential purchasers the price,
yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And I think you agree with me that at least so far as the brochures and
information memorandum simpliciter are concerned those
documents make no
mention of the fact that either it's an option at an agreed price situation or
what the price is?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I think it just said the opportunity to purchase the livestock
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And indeed it is not until you are some little way into the promotion
process that you are able to nominate the price because
you haven't fixed up
yourself what the price is until you've gone through this discussion process
that you've referred to?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, the price wasn't fixed, as I said, until the second or third week
of August.'    </i>[T238-239]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

148	Mr Skinner accepted that because he assumed that any shortfall between the
nominated price for the cattle and the actual market
price of the cattle, if
there one, would be picked up in the sale of the land, he wasn't concerned to
keep track of what was happening
to the market price of cattle between
July/August when he went through the exercise which he spoke of.  [T239]
<P>

149	It was put to Mr Skinner that during this period in fact there was a very
strong increase in the value of breeder cattle - that
is to say from July to
September.  His evidence was that he couldn't recollect when he became aware of
that.  His evidence was that
certainly there was an increase in prices in that
period but he may have only become aware of it after the auction - he could not
be certain.  He was in fact away for two or three weeks before the auction.  He
had not reviewed prices during that period.
<P>

150	Mr Skinner was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Well, would you agree that the price of cows, even in the Armidale
yards, lifted by a third during that period?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I couldn't say that.  I just don't have that knowledge.   I don't
know.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because </i><cite>you had in place no mechanism to tell you if there was
a significant change in the value of the Jeogla herd between July and 22
September</cite><i>;  that's right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I did not review the livestock price before the auction sale.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	No?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The market price I mean.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because you assumed that any error that might have undervalued the value
of the Jeogla herd in its sale with the land would be
picked up in the price
bid for the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.'</i>  [T240]
<P>

151	In fact, during Mr Skinner's absence he left Mr Campbell in charge of the
receivership and had told Mr Campbell that the purchaser
should be offered a
right of first refusal for the purchase of the livestock and that the prices
specified in schedule 1 of the draft
contract for sale of the livestock
included a premium above the market appraisal conducted by Elders.  [T240]
<P>

152	As to paragraph 41 of Mr Skinner's affidavit in which he had deposed that
he relied upon the 4 August Maddigan appraisal as
representing the market price
for the cattle, Mr Skinner's evidence at transcript 241, was that he was
referring to Mr Maddigan's
estimate of the market price for which the cattle
could be sold in September.
<P>

153	Mr Skinner had, as has already been noted, stated in paragraph 52 of his
affidavit, that the contract for the sale of the livestock
was to envisage an
adjustment after a stock count but that the prices specified were based on the
appraisal of stock conducted by
Elders plus an average premium of 13%.  Mr
Skinner was asked under cross-examination whether he agreed that the process of
reasoning
that had caused the prices in the schedule to be nominated prior to
the auction, to be an uplift of 13% was to allow for an anticipated
increase in
price between July and September.  He accepted that this was the case and this
was the major factor.
<P>

154	At transcript 243, Mr Skinner gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`. . . it needs to be clear that the July valuation was Mr Maddigan's
estimate based on - or his estimate of market price at that
date, but within
the category - within a condition he forecast them to be in October;  so it was
high.  He wasn't trying to estimate
or guess what the market may do between
July and October.  . . .   The discussion in August centred around
reclassifying the livestock
better.  If you've seen the schedule that's annexed
to the livestock contract you'll see that that's different to Mr Maddigan's
July
appraisal.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You've split out the heifers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	And changed the prices.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you have changed the pricing to reflect the price that calves that
were at foot in July are now stand alone animals as of
September?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, but Mr Maddigan anticipated that in his July valuation, so that
wasn't  - the schedule is set out differently, but he did
anticipate that they
would be in that condition, as I understand it, in October because he was using
an October delivery date, so
that the concept is not different.  What did
change, though, when they were split out he reassessed his values and then we
put a
margin on over and above those.  Part of that was just safety,
anticipating market increases.  I know from my experience that in
September the
markets do normally lift, but it was a price that they came up not just
overall, but they went through each category
- "they", being David McCarthy and
Andy Maddigan, reassessed each line and that was the value that was ultimately
arrived at and
put to me for approval.'</i>
<P>

155	At transcript 244 under cross-examination in relation to the possibility
that by the auction time, there would prove to have
been an undervaluation of
the stock.  The following appears:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	What I'm suggesting to you is this, as you've said to his Honour a
number of times now, you considered in the auction process
that you had set up
if there was any undervaluation of the stock it would be picked up in the price
bid for the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	To that extent the option to take the cattle at that price had a value
if the market price of the cattle was in fact greater than
the agreed value for
the cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, both ways;  if the market was up or down it had an effect, either a
premium or a discount, either way.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	We need not concern ourselves with discount because you could, of
course, simply not take up the option and take the land and
acquire the cattle
another way.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I think you do have to consider it because in the process that we
put in place a purchaser that wanted to buy the property
and the livestock as a
business was going to assess the total.  Whether they thought there was a
premium or a discount on the livestock
would get reflected up or down in the
sale price of the land.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . Is this right, that in September you did not know whether the
option that you were offering in relation to the purchase
of the livestock was
or was not itself intrinsically valuable . . .  the option to take up the
livestock could acquire value of its
own, could it not, if the agreed sale
price or nominated sale price in your contract was less than the cattle were
worth?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	When you say its "a value on its own", its only got value if it is with
the land, if it's sold together.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I understand that Mr Skinner, but you say the value that would attach to
the capacity to take up the cattle at an agreed price
in connection with the
price of the land in connection with the purchase of the land . . . might add a
premium to the price you pay
for the land because that option had intrinsic
value if the price or the value of the cattle had gone up?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I agree with that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It was because you were not gathering information as to the actual value
of these cattle, as you moved up towards the auction
date, you did not know
whether the option in fact had intrinsic value or not, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's not right.  I mentioned that we met with Mr Maddigan at the end
of August.  That was three weeks or four weeks before the
auction with the 13%
factor on top.  It was the considered view of Mr Maddigan and us that that
would cater for the current market,
so it was unlikely, in my mind, that there
was a huge premium or discount.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I see.  On the basis of the Maddigan assessment as at June and the
massaging of the figures toward the end of August, plus the
13%, you formed the
view that that was market value as at 22 September;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, an estimate of what the market might be as at 22 September
yes.'</i>  [T244-245]
<P>

156	Under cross-examination, Mr Skinner was asked whether he had directed his
mind to what would happen if the land did not sell
at the auction and his
answer was that he would have had to sit down and reassess the whole plan
forward.  There were a lot of considerations
which would have had to have been
taken into account.  [T245]
<P>

157	The following appears in Mr Skinner's cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Your selling strategy at the auction was that the agreed price option
for the cattle would attract to your sale both those persons
who wished to buy
as a going concern and those persons who simply wanted to buy the soil and not
take up the option for the cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And if those two lots of buyers didn't get you to a satisfactory price,
one of the alternatives that then confronted you was,
was it not, whether you
would do better selling the cattle separately to the land, by a dispersal
sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If we hadn't got to a satisfactory price yes, an alternative was to sell
the two separately.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If you had a person who was bidding a price that appeared on a
reasonable assessment simply to be the price of the property as
land, you could
do what you did with Hernani, which was to sell the cattle separately.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you give a consideration as to what the break points in pricing
would be between selling the cattle and the land and selling
the two
separately?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	On the assumption that the livestock prices reflected the market price,
which was the assumption I was working on, or the estimated
market price, then
the range of valuations we had for the property was somewhere between $5.3 to
$6.2million, so getting a price
midway within that range, and I've got to say
this is after the auction because I was not at the auction, but in talking to
Mr Campbell
the view was that the purchaser was buying the two, a combined
venture - sorry, the highest bidder offered on the basis that he was
going to
exercise the option.  Given that the price of the land was within that range
and a value of the livestock was fixed beforehand,
then it was quite reasonable
to presume that we actually did get a premium . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you give any consideration to what price you would offer for the
cattle separately to the land, in order to see what could
be realised for the
cattle as a separate exercise?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	. . . My view was that if the property had achieved more than the market
value on the basis it was sold, together with the livestock
fixed at that price
it was fixed at, then I would have recommended to the bank to accept the sale .
. . If it had gone below that
then I would have said "No, let's discuss an
alternative strategy".</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Did you ever ask anyone to value this cattle herd on the basis
that it be submitted to a dispersal sale</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No, I just asked for a valuation of the
cattle</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you ever ask anyone who provided you with such a value or appraisal
whether they had considered what these animals might realise
in a dispersal
sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I understand that the valuation provided by Mr Maddigan was the
value of the livestock on a market value basis, which would
imply a sale . . .
</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Quite?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Now, he - yes.  Sorry - what's the right word - a sale by mechanism of
the livestock.  Whether you want to call it a dispersal
sale or some other sort
of sale he had in mind, he valued the cattle at the market price of the figure
he put on it, the $1.7million
approximately.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Did you ever enquire of him as to what market he had in mind
as the market in which the hypothetical sale was taking place</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Not specifically.  The market is all the people that buy
livestock</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But with the greatest of respect, Mr Skinner, you said to us yesterday
that you understood that there might be significant price
differentials between
the same beast offered in a fat market and the beast that was eligible to do so
being offered in a store cattle
or breeding sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think I said yesterday that depends on the market conditions at the
time.  The price differential can be different, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The differences may be very marked between the meat value of a
particular beast and its value in the breeding market?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's potentially possible, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Did you ask Mr Maddigan, "Look, when you say market prices at
a given point in time, to which market are you referring for these animals,
because I see a breeding herd and I see animals which might be turned off for
breeding or for meat?  What sort of market or marketing
do you have in mind
when you express these numbers</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No, I don't think I asked specifically</cite><i> . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you ask anyone to express an opinion as to what might be realised
for these animals were they put forward in a dispersal sale
as a breeding
herd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not on that basis, no.  As I said before, the prices finally agreed with
Mr Maddigan were forwarded to Mr Watts of PR Watts, the
stock and station
agents in Armidale, and they agreed with the pricing as well.  It's two
different agents, stock and station agents.
 I presumed that a stock and
station agent knows the appropriate basis to value livestock.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You asked neither Mr Maddigan nor Mr Watts to direct their minds to what
would be the likely outcome so far as price if the animals
were submitted to a
dispersal sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I did not give them that.  I did not ask that specific question,
no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But you understood in relation to a breeding herd, save in particular
market conditions, that that would be the highest and best
realisation of the
animals didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Of the cows?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The breeding cows.  I would say yes . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you or the bank had spent considerable time, effort and money in
getting substantial valuations of the land expressed on a
number of different
bases in the valuation report?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	On two bases yes.'</i>
<P>

<i>	`Q.	</i><cite>Mr Skinner, where does one find any advice to you as to what
the realisation outcome might be if the cattle were offered into the
various
markets into which those cattle might be sold in August and September of
1998</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I didn't go about separately valuing - sorry, I did not receive any
advice on what the cattle might realise for argument sake
if they were all sent
to slaughter, which was one option, I guess, or if they were sold in different
types of sales whether it was
in the Armidale sale yard or off the property.
The advice I received was that the best mechanism for maximum price was the
land and
livestock sold together and . . . that is the spectrum of the advice
that I received . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	One of the matters that should interest you, I take it, is to what
extent any uplift in the price that you might expect to get
for the land was
justified by any diminution in the prospective realisation proceeds of the herd
when you sold them together;  is
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, did you have any appraisal from anyone as to what you could expect
to receive on realisation if you sold the herd by a dispersal
sale separately
from the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I relied on Mr Maddigan's valuation being the value of the cattle
in the market at that time.  </i><cite>I did not specifically ask him whether
there was a dispersal sale or selling them all to a meat works for
auction</cite><i>, no, I didn't get valuations on different bases, but I
believed the purpose of getting the valuation or the appraisal was so that
I
could do two things - first of all, was to fix the price in the contract but
also based on the appraisal, being three or four weeks
after the adjustments,
after the date of the auction.  I had the view that that would be close to
market place . . .'</i>    [T246-250]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

158	At transcript 251-252, Mr Skinner's evidence was that what was occurring at
the auction, he understood, was that this was a
dispersal.  `Well, if you are
selling all, it is a dispersal.  You can't - may be it's the terminology, but
if you're selling 5,000
cattle off a property, that's dispersal.'
<P>

159	Mr Skinner at transcript 252, accepted that his evidence was that the
Maddigan appraisal was taken to be what would be attained
on, in effect, a
properly conducted dispersal sale to all comers bidding for those animals.  He
was then asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Of course when it came to the auction, access to the animals was
conditioned by having 5million or more to buy the land first
before you could
get a crack at the animals?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	At the - yes, that's correct, at that auction, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So that the access to competitive bidding in relation to the animals was
predicated on the proposition that any bidders prepared
to pay, in effect, a
door fee for $5million to get into the sale yard at all?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I wouldn't express it that way, but, yes, for someone to buy, they had
to be able to afford the land and the livestock.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Therefore you had effectively confined the prospective purchasing group
in relation to the land and the livestock to those able
to meet $7million or so
as the minimum price?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you consider what effect that might have on the prospects of
achieving the highest and best realisation for the cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In the - yes, I did consider the total package and the - I'll go back
and start again.  In assessing the method of sale of the
land and the livestock
and based on the advice I got from the various agents - real estate agents,
rural agents - that the best realisation
for the land was to sell the two
together, I then got a valuation or an appraisal of the livestock that I
believed fixed a market
price for the livestock.  Now, in that scenario, I
believed I would maximise the total realisations.'   </i>[T252-253]
<P>

160	Mr Skinner was asked whether he had looked for anyone who was certified as
a valuer who was prepared to give him a valuation
of the herd.  His answer was
:
<P>

	<i>`No, I believed I could rely on Mr Maddigan's experience on the basis of
his business, his reputation, the fact that he conducted
Jeogla sales for a
number of years, I thought he was in the best position to give me the
appropriate value.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	These are the Jeogla production sales you are referring to?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you enquire of him as to whether he had ever conducted a dispersal
sale of a herd of the quality of Jeogla herd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm not sure if I could put it that way, but I certainly enquired if he
was qualified in selling store cattle which are cattle
to restock, etc. . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	These are the very matters that you did consider in relation to the sale
of land, how it would be promoted, at what cost, what
range of prices.  Do we
find anywhere in your consideration of the cattle any consideration of these
issues and assistance with defining
how much would be involved in undertaking
these various courses?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If I can do it by way of analogy.  If you've got any business that you
are attempting to sell and it is a total business, it's
got premises and it's
got stock in trade, etc, then it is quite often that you will get a valuation
of the land and buildings in
the form that was done in this case and you might
get a particular person, it could be an auctioneer, it could be somebody else,
to give you an indication of the stock.  The stock in trade is different, if I
can use those words, to land and buildings.  The stock
is something that's
regularly traded.  Livestock is sold every week throughout the State.  It is,
in my view, a different category
of asset than land and building.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But, Mr Skinner, </i><cite>the thing that is not sold regularly every
week in New South Wales is a top quality breeding herd offered on a dispersal
basis to
people interested in cattle breeding and the production of beef from a
commercial herd is it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There are regular sales of breeding cattle.  In my view you're confusing
the fact that the number - nobody was going to buy, in
my view, 4,000 head of
these cattle at once.  When you reduce them down to pens of 20 or so head of
cattle, of breeders, that is
not uncommon to be sold . . .'  </i>[T253-254]
[Emphasis added]
<P>

161	The cross-examination includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Skinner, assuming all that is correct, is this right : with the sale
of this herd, you assumed that this herd would not, so
far as the prices it
would obtain on sale, perform significantly differently from ordinary store
cattle sales conducted around the
state from time to time.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I didn't say that.  I said it would not vary differently from Mr
Maddigan's appraisal.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, Mr Maddigan's appraisal, may I take it you considered to be based
on ordinary store cattle outcomes around the place in
the sale yards;  is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Plus faced with the premium for the Jeogla brand.  If you look at my
letter, I asked him to take that into consideration in his
appraisal.  My
letter of instructions set out that I wanted him to take into account the brand
and the name.  I think I even included
the Cattle Care etc.  I wanted him to
take that into account into his appraisal and he did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you then ask anyone who might have had some experience in conducting
a sale of a herd of this type to offer an opinion as
to whether Mr Maddigan was
or was not right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	As I mentioned when we fixed the prices, they were sent to Mr Watts of
PR Watts, another agent, and he approved - he agreed with
them.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You simply assumed that those prices would reflect what you would get on
a dispersal sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>And you asked neither of those people to direct his mind to
advising you nor did you ask anyone else to advise you as to whether there
might be more advantageous ways of realising the stock than selling them in
connection with the sale of the land at the appraised
price from Mr
Maddigan</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I didn't think I needed to.</i>'   [T255]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Mr E.J. Crowe</b>
<P>

162	Evidence was given by Mr E.J. Crowe, a licensed auctioneer and a licensed
stock and station agent and a licensed real estate
agent.  Mr Crowe's evidence
is regarded as reliable and is accepted.  It is detailed below and returned to
later in the Judgment.
 Mr Crowe's evidence was that he sells and values cattle
throughout New South Wales and in particular in the New England and North
West
area of New South Wales.  From about April 1964 to about April 1965, he worked
with Elders Stock and Station Agency at Yass
and conducted livestock auctions
and was involved in livestock sales.  From April 1965 to about April 1966 he
worked with Elders
Stock and Station Agency at Tamworth and conducted livestock
auctions and was involved in livestock sales.  That work at Yass and
Tamworth
involved mainly sheep and cattle.
<P>

163	From1966 to approximately 1976 Mr Crowe worked for the Stud Stock
Department of Elders and was based at Tamworth.  He sold,
purchased and valued
stud stock in that capacity.  He conducted stud stock sales for Elders during
that period.  That work involved
mainly sheep and cattle.
<P>

164	From about 1976 to about 1979, Mr Crowe was the Breed Development Officer
for the Australian Hereford Society.  His work in
this capacity involved
developing and promoting the Hereford breed of beef cattle.  He obtained a very
detailed awareness of the
characteristics and value of Hereford cattle as part
of this employment.
<P>

165	From approximately 1979 to the present time, Mr Crowe has worked as both a
stock and station agent and on a farm which he owns
near Tamworth.
<P>

166	During the period 1980 to approximately 1988, Mr Crowe was a guest
auctioneer at the autumn and spring sales held at Jeogla
Station.
<P>

167	Mr Crowe's evidence was that on 30 May 1998 he had attended at Jeogla
Station and inspected and carried out a valuation of certain
cattle at the
Station.
<P>

168	His valuation is appended to the Judgment as Appendix 7.
<P>

169	His evidence was that Jeogla Station is recognised as one of the leading
beef cattle operations in eastern Australia.  His evidence
was that he is
familiar with the V1V Hereford Beef Maker Cattle from Jeogla.  His evidence was
that these are high quality cattle.
 His evidence was that the Bank of sound
genetic material built into the herd over many decades of effort have ensured a
predictable
product that has been keenly sought after from both breeders and
fatteners from many areas of Australia.
<P>

170	Mr Crowe also gave evidence that the herd had been at the forefront of
performance testing and quality assurance.  This had
been monitored through
Ausmeat Feedback Trials.  His evidence was that this gave a high degree of
quality assurance which is keenly
sought within the industry at the present
time.
<P>

171	Mr Crowe's evidence was that he had conducted auction sales at facilities
other than Jeogla during the course of his career.
 Such facilities were to be
found all over eastern Australia including New South Wales, Victoria and South
Australia but principally
in New South Wales.
<P>

172	His evidence was that the valuations which he made at the time `were on the
basis of a proper organised and promoted auction
sale on that day'.
[Transcript page 12]
<P>

173	In referring to such an auction sale, he had in mind as the location for
the sale the Jeogla property.  Insofar as the facility
which he had in mind was
concerned, it was very good and this was because the selling by itself was set
up in the area.  There was
a good sale ring.  Seating for buyers was excellent.
The art system for the display of cattle pre-sale was excellent and the general
facility for the conduct of such a sale were totally adequate.
<P>

174	Mr Crowe gave evidence as to the differences between different types of
auction sales of cattle which he had encountered in
the course of his
experience.  He referred to stud cattle auctions, commercial cattle auctions
and fat cattle auctions.  In relation
to the auction sales which he had
participated in at Jeogla during the 1980's, those embraced probably all three
types of auction
but principally were commercial cattle sale auctions.  There
had been some studs involved but not many.  The sales which Mr Crowe
had been
involved in would have involved he said, a small percentage of stud cattle but
principally good breeding cattle, commercial
breeding cattle.
<P>

175	His evidence as to the attributes of a production sale was that it usually
embraced surplus cattle as well as cattle that were
sold to the fattening
industry, being feed lots or grass fattening.  Such a sale would embrace most
ranges of cattle which would
be cast for age cows to be culled and the like.
Also sold in the same way would be surplus breeding cattle of advancing ages
including
male cattle being steer male cattle bred on the property.
<P>

176	He had been associated in particular with two production sales a year at
Jeogla.  Those production sales held in Autumn and
Spring were, he recalled,
part of the general farm process.  This was because Jeogla was solely a beef
breeding enterprise.  The
basis of the business run on Jeogla, he understood,
was that the two sales conducted enabled the principals to run the business and
be financially viable.
<P>

177	As to why one might approach the market to sell the cattle in Autumn was
concerned, his evidence was that Jeogla being situated
in the New England area,
there were difficulties for Winter more than certain other geographical areas.
It was usual that one would
tend to have sales in Autumn when one was coming
into the more difficult Winter period.  That was a common practice for farmers
other
than Jeogla as well.  In terms of the Autumn sales, he had in mind that
this took place at Jeogla in May.  May was really the onset
of Winter periods
in the New England area.
<P>

178	Mr Crowe was asked whether, if one went to the Armidale sale yards in May
one would see sales conducted which were representative
of the quality of stock
available generally in the district at the time.  His answer was that there
would be various sales conducted
at the Armidale sale yards in May.  Armidale
has a regular facility, stock market which takes place on Thursday each week.
There
would be several weaner sales.  These embrace calves from 7 to 11 months
of age and included in those sales are surplus females and
sometimes older
steers.
<P>

179	As to the nature and quality of cows sold in Armidale during May, in terms
of fat stock, Mr Crowe's evidence was that these
would be cattle who were to be
put to the processing side of the industry and that very little of May would be
going back into the
breeding herd.  At a fat stock sale, Mr Crowe would not
have expected breeding quality to be very significant.  His evidence was
that
it would be quite exceptional if there was breeding quality which was
significant in the May fat stock sale.  The standard of
weaner sale stock would
be good.
<P>

180	He was asked whether to the extent that one had weaners, sending those into
the market in May out of the breeding stock, he
would in his experience, expect
the best quality such weaners to be sent in.  His answer was in the negative
and this was because
the cattle that would be offered at a Thursday market in
Armidale in May would normally be fat stock market cattle which would have
a
residual value only.  His evidence was that any cattle intended for a further
breeding programme would be put into a very differently
advertised programme
sale.
<P>

181	As to the cattle that would be put into the Armidale May fat stock sales,
his evidence was that they would have reached the
end of their breeding life.
If they were only young they had probably had calving difficulties.  They would
have poor milking ability
and/or their calving would be over.  They would have
reached an age when it was no longer productive to maintain them as sound
breeding
units.
<P>

182	Insofar as his evidence had been that breeding cattle would be sold in an
entirely different way was concerned, he was asked
how in the ordinary course
of things if a farmer wanted four or five breeding stock sold, they would be
offered for sale.  His evidence
here was that it was unusual to have otherwise
than a multi-vendor steer sale.  Smaller sales were not the usual.
<P>

183	His evidence was that one would not find during May too many breeding
cattle for sale at the stockyards in Armidale.  The sales
in May, apart from
the fat stock sales, would mainly embrace weaner sales and this was because of
the season.  Steer sales started
to become active in Armidale from
mid-September on through October, November in the spring and early summer
months at a time when
farmers were restocking.  By then, farmers would see that
they had more feed at their disposal and would certainly be more prepared
to
take on extra animals feeling more secure generally from the more favourable
period of the year.
<P>

184	Insofar as multi-vendor sale of steer cattle breeding wise and the like
were concerned, he was asked how in the ordinary course,
those sales were
conducted by the person responsible for selling.  His evidence was that they
would be advertised through the general
media, the rural press and television
advertising.  This would depend upon the numbers.
<P>

185	He was asked to assume that he as stock and station agent was charged with
the responsibility of conducting a multi-vendor steel
cattle auction such as he
had been describing and in that regard what amount he would expect to spend on
such a sale.  His answer
was :
<P>

	<i>`This can vary depending what, on what market you are trying to appeal to.
If you only have a small number of cattle obviously you
are not going to embark
on a huge advertising programme in future.  You might do it on a locality
nature but if it isn't a big sale,
a small sale, you might only spend 2 or
$3,000 in preparing a steer sale in a local area.  If it is a yard sale or a
dispersal sale
then you would certainly be having a far greater sized
budget.'</i>     [Transcript page 18]
<P>

186	In Mr Crowe's terms, the numbers of cattle he had in mind when talking
about a small sale were $400 to $600.  In his experience,
the large sales that
he referred to could involve something like 2 or 3,000 head of cattle.
<P>

187	His evidence was that a dispersal sale is the complete disposal of a herd.
A production sale is often referred to as a sale
where the females make up the
major portion of the sale.  A reduction sale on the other hand may be one where
most breeds of cattle
could be developed.
<P>

188	Mr Crowe had had experience of dispersal sales of cattle herds from time to
time in his career.  Such a situation might arise
where there was a deceased
estate being wound up or in certain circumstances breeders change their
directions and move into another
line of agricultural production.  His evidence
was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	you have seen dispersal sales of a herd such as you see on Jeogla and
have been seeing on jobs over a number of years, does that
have any different
connotation to dispersal sales, meaning, I am selling all my cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  The Jeogla herd is one that had been built up over three
generations and it had a reputation in the beef industry not only
in this State
but right throughout Australia, as being a very reliable supplier of beef
animals for both breeding and fattening.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And when you say "a reliable supplier" to what are you referring as the
elements of reliability?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I guess with the production of beef, meaning from the Jeogla property, .
. . I mean produced with more muscle less fat, yet at
the same time retaining
those characteristics of doability, fertility and growth . . . doability is
exemplified by an animal's ability
to convert feed into beef by such things as
grain in a feedlot or grass in a pasture situation.'    </i>[Transcript page
20]
<P>

189	His evidence was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`If you are contemplating the sale of the whole of a herd such as Jeogla,
first of all would it be a herd that you would sell through
the fat cattle or
the weaner market at the local sale yard?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Referring to the Jeogla cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	First and foremost they have a very good selling complex on the
property.  You would not load cattle and transport them to the
Armidale
stockyards when you have a selling facility which is already constructed on the
property . . . the other feature is that
the type of cattle sales that Jeogla
had become very highly regarded for, you would maintain that successful selling
programme. 
There would be no need for you to move cattle to a saleyard like
Armidale . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Would you then, in conducting the auction on Jeogla, conduct it as a fat
cattle market sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	How would you be conducting an auction of the Jeogla herd on Jeogla if
it fell to you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	They would be sold on a per head basis as distinct from selling per
kilogram of live weight.  </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Would you handle the promotion of such a sale differently from the way
you would deal with the sale of fat cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In what respects?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	A sale of fat cattle, it is important to have the support of the
producing side of the industry.  A sale of cattle of the nature
we are dealing
with here at Jeogla, you would be directing your advertising and selling to the
breeding side of the beef cattle industry.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The producers rather than the consumers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Where do you find producers of cattle such as the herd at Jeogla?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	They are white face cattle produced in most areas of Australia but I
think these are specific beef maker cattle that we are referring
to and this is
a breed that has been developed by the Wright family.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But are beef makers specifically peculiarly sensitive to being within
five kilometres of the Wright household?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Beef makers are bred in many areas of Australia.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And in your promotion of a dispersal of the Jeogla herd where would you
seek to promote such a sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well I would certainly embrace the three eastern states of Australia and
if you were disposing of the entire herd of Jeogla your
advertising would
embrace Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria in particular and you expect
you would be buying support from
at least those areas.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Would it make a difference to buying support between putting a few
hundred beasts up for sale and putting up 5,000?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In the industry we call it strength in numbers.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	How does that manifest itself and why?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If I was a grower in the West Coast of Victoria and I was interested in
obtaining a line of breading cattle from Jeogla, I would
think the trip, as
greater trip physically it would be far more worthwhile if I had an opportunity
to bid on 5,000 rather than 500.
 The opportunity of a larger number of animals
in the sale affords more opportunity to buyers attending.'    </i>[Transcript
page 22]
<P>

190	His evidence was that assuming a dispersal of the cattle at Jeogla would
involve the disposal about 5,000 head of cattle his
advertising budget would
have been through the medium of rural press, radio, television - approximately
$14,000 to $15,000.
<P>

191	Mr Crowe's evidence was that it was his view that disposing of the subject
herd ought be by sale at a dispersal sale or a store
sale on a per head price
basis.  His experience was that disposal of a herd of cattle of this nature
could only employ these modes
of sale.  If one was going to a fat sale
situation, then it was very different because then sale would take place on a
cents per
kilo basis.  Disposing of cattle of this nature he would expect to be
at an open auction where a price per head basis was established.
 [Transcript
page 24]
<P>

192	Mr Crowe was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	In your experience . . . is the price paid for breeding cattle,
breeding cows such as the 1994 Beefmaker cow, in your list, determined
by the
price being paid for killing cattle at the same time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Almost insignificant.  Perhaps the only qualification I would make, if
somebody was selling something of their own for a pretty
good price it might
see them better set up financially to go forward and spend a better price.  But
if I could explain, that selling
cattle of this nature on a per kilo basis is
very foreign to me.  These are breeding cattle and have a real value . . .
</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In your experience </i><cite>have you seen breeding cattle being sold on
a per kilo basis?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Never, never in my experience</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why is that, in your experience?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think it would be generally agreed you would not achieve their real
value.  </i><cite>You would be having no regard for the genetics package that
is involved.</cite><i>  You would be having no regard for the state of
breeding, whether it be a three, four or ten year old.  All has a bearing and I
just
think it would be a most unsatisfactory way of disposing of cattle of this
nature . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In so far as the dollar amount that you have attributed to the various
classes of animal that you describe in your annexure A,
in arriving at those
figures </i><cite>do you take into account, in any degree, a price per kilo
that might be obtained for meat, embodied in either the cow or the calf,
the
heifer, the steer or the bull</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What did you take into account in attributing those dollar amounts to
those various classes of animals described in your schedule?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I had regard to the growth and condition of the cattle, the quality of
the cattle, the condition and quality of the calves at
side, for those cows
that had calves at side and the general wide acceptance that the job the cattle
had as really being an elite
herd in the beef cattle industry in this
State.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Did you take into account that they were sold on a dispersal
basis</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes, yes</cite><i>, I had regard to the fact that - I mean, it
would only be - if I could say to the Court, </i><cite>it would only be a
dispersal that would see these type of cattle go under an auctioneer's
hammer</cite><i>.  These are the basis of three generations of a family
breeding, as I say, an elite herd of cattle, and if they were maintaining
their
form in the beef industry, there would be no reason to sell them.  They
wouldn't be prepared to part with them.  But if they
were leaving the industry
for whatever reason, and </i><cite>these cattle were at a properly promoted and
organised sale, then I am secure that the values I have nominated - they are
average
prices</cite><i>.  If I could just explain to the Court, with the
numbers involved, take the first 446, there may be cows there that could make
650
or $680.  There may be some that may make $520 or $540, but I was
interested in arriving at an average figure which is common in
a valuation of
this nature, </i><cite>and was secure in my estimation that those particular
lines were worth the money that I have listed on that valuation .</cite><i> .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>In the auction sale did you have in mind in striking the
values that you described in your paragraph A, you were assuming this was
a
dispersal sale</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.  that would be the only reason these cattle
would be, as I say, submitted for sale if it was a dispersal.  Yes, that would
be what
I had in mind, yes.'</i>
<P>

<P>

193	Mr Crowe's evidence was that at a properly promoted and advertised auction
sale, he would imagine a sale of this nature could
draw 400 or 500 potential
buyers, each selecting the grade of animal that they see fit and placing their
own value on such animals.
 In his experience, `where a property and stock on
hand is wrapped up in one, of course that is only a negotiation between the
purchaser
and the seller which sometimes [he believed] could be effective, but
that is the exception. . . . rather than the rule', and in this
case he
believed their real value, would be best achieved at a separate public auction.
[Transcript 27-28]
<P>

194	In Mr Crowe's experience, it was not correct to say that the buyers who
might be interested in attending a dispersal sale of
the herd were likely to be
in the market for land.  [Transcript 28]
<P>

195	Mr Crowe gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	I want you to assume, Mr Crowe, that if an appraisal were made, this is
of the Jeogla cattle at 30 July 1998, based on, amongst
other things, the
prices achieved at a livestock sale at Armidale on 23 July 1998, detailed in a
Livestock Market Detailed Cattle
Report issued by the National Livestock
Reporting Service - to be fair I will show you the document that has been
referred to.  I
am showing you two pages extracted from an affidavit that will
be read in the proceedings reproducing a document headed `Livestock
Market
Detail Cattle Report' from 23 July 1998 to 23 July 1998 Armidale Yarding 700 -
is that a document with which you are familiar?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  I see these reports from time to time yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you, from a perusal of that document, tell his Honour what type of
sale is there being reported on?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	This is the regular weekly fat stock market at the Armidale City Sale
Yards . . .'.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 28]
<P>

196	Mr Crowe gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	In relation to the cattle that you saw on Jeogla, and appraised as to
their value in your annexure A, before appraisal of such
cattle, would you have
regard to the prices being paid by purchasers in the Thursday sales at
Armidale, in May, that you have seen
in the reports I just handed to
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It would be </i><cite>of no significant relationship</cite><i> to the
values that I have made.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 29]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

197	Mr Crowe was reminded that in his affidavit, he had said that it was his
expectation that if the cattle that he saw on 30 May
1998 were sold in spring
of 1998, they would command a higher price.  He was then asked as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And then you went on to say "I estimate the price would have been 10 to
15% higher".  Now, first of all, when you said, `I estimate
the price would
have been 10 to 15% higher", to what were you directing your mind in making
that statement . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	First of all, I take it that you are addressing yourself to 10 to 15%
higher than the figures you have nominated in your report?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You were writing your affidavit in January 1999, well after the event of
spring 1998.  </i><cite>Did you in fact make any observation concerning the
prices of cattle, the values of cattle as between May 1998 and spring
1998</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes, there had been some increases in cattle
prices</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Was that increase localised to particular cattle or particular types of
cattle, in your observation, or was it general?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>It was general</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And your recollection, in percentage terms expressed in that way, in
what amount had the value changed between May 1998 and spring
1998?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>I feel the values of the animals that I valued would have
increased by 15%</cite><i> . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . Between May and September . . . would you in the ordinary course
of things expect the price, the value at least to change
in any way, whatever
else the market was doing?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The spring period obviously offers better opportunities for both
breeding cattle and fattening cattle to improve in value.  I
mean, in a good
spring season situation you are not going to have supplementary feeding costs,
whereas back in May you could not
be sure.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I take it that [is] a matter you would expect to effect the general
market price of cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	. . . Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	As between any given herd of cattle, between May and September, would
you expect some change in the value of the herd to occur,
whether or not the
general market increased?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Cows with calves, autumn drop at side in May have obviously grown on to
be of greater value by September . . .'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 30- 31]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

198	Mr Crowe was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	</i><cite>You saw the cattle in May.  Did you have, when you came to
write your affidavit, any belief as to what would have occurred in relation
to
the value of that herd between May and September?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What was that belief?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well </i><cite>it is my belief that the herd would have improved in
value to 10 to 15%.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What matters would have contributed to that increase of 10 to
15%?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Firstly, the growth of calves at side or the born new calves that were
in utero back in May, the steers would have grown out,
they would have had an
extra growth and consequently more weight, and coupled with that would have
been the favourable seasonal conditions
that were experienced in a wide range
of New South Wales for the spring of 1998.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 32]
<P>

199	Mr Crowe under cross-examination, was asked as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Can I take you back to the details of the sales at the Armidale Fat
Sales.  </i><cite>Would you agree that if somebody was valuing the Jeogla
cattle it would be appropriate to look at these published records of the sales
and then add on some premium for the value of the cattle, having regard to the
fact that it came from Jeogla or that it was V1V brand
cattle that was being
sold?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What is wrong with that methodology?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The Armidale sale that you have made reference to is one - as I think we
have addressed already - it is a market place for processing
cattle.  It is
market results which are achieved in the main, not necessarily all, but in the
main.  This is the Armidale Weekly
Fat Market held on the Thursday of each week
for cattle that are going to processors and apart from the male cattle on my
valuation
list, I wouldn't think any of those cattle submitted to auction on 30
May would go to the processing side of the industry, they would
all go back out
to breeders, so for sales at the weekly sales at Armidale that you made
reference to, that gives me no real guide
as to the value of the cattle running
on Jeogla on 30 May . . .  </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You do not have any objective guide yourself, do you, to make a
comparison?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I have a very good guide on what processing cattle are worth because
they are listed in the livestock market reports for the various
grades of
cattle but these cattle don't fit into those categories.  These are breeding
cattle with three family generations of breeding
behind them, giving a far
greater degree of product for the resultant progeny than most of the cattle
that would go through the Armidale
Fat Market Sale Day.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 47]
<P>

200	In re-examination, Mr Crowe at transcript page 57, gave the following
evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	It was suggested to you by Mr Jacobson that there was no information
upon which you could form a view about the prices that you
attributed to the
animals in your annexure A and I think you said to him that the results from
the Armidale fat sales were not something
that you considered.  What other
source of information did you have in mind when you answered my learned
friend's question?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, just - sorry, okay.  Early in the month of May 1998 I journeyed to
Maniro, Cooma, where there were just over 2,000 Angus
females put through a
public auction system - very good cattle - as Angus, probably on a level with
what V1B [sic] makers are as
beef makers.  But the tops of those cattle were
making $800, $850.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is another very well promoted and organised Angus sale at Scone in
the Hunter Valley each year at the end of May.  The tops
of those cattle make
more value than I have had here.  I mean, you are dealing with, as I mentioned
earlier, an elite herd of cattle
and </i><cite>where you have that standard
going before the public in a properly promoted sale, you definitely command a
premium, rightfully so,
and this is what the people are prepared to pay
</cite><i>. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Apart from the sales that you attended personally of the breed of cattle
that you have referred to, are the results of sales of
that type - that is to
say, of the store cattle for commercial herd - published in any
publication?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh yes, the Land Newspaper, Hereford Quarterly, the Angus Annual
Magazine.  I could take you to the Stewarts Creek sale held in
Roma each year -
a very highly regarded sale, a multi-vendor sale, but yarding 3,500, 4,000
cattle.  But people from Victoria go
there to buy, because </i><cite>they know
the quality, they know there are the numbers and they know that the cattle they
can take on and make money with, fit into
their breeding programmes and this is
an exact parallel</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T57,58]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

201	Mr Crowe was asked the following question and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	When you inspected the cattle in the paddocks, I think you said to his
Honour that you were being given information from time
to time by Mr Wright
about the cattle;  from your physical observation of the cattle, did you
perceive any incongruity between what
you were being told and what you
saw?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 59]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Evidence given by Mr David Nolan</b>
<P>

202	Mr Nolan is a stock and station agent and real estate agent who had, for 20
years, been such.  Since November 1996, he had been
the principal of LJ Hooker
Rural New South Wales.  Before that he had been the National Manager of LJ
Hooker Rural Australia.  He
was the agent appointed by the receiver on the sale
of Jeogla and Bald Hills.  At the time he made his submission to the receiver
for appointment as an agent to sell Jeogla Station, he had looked over the
property and had made observations as to the condition
of the cattle at the
time.  Mr Nolan's evidence is generally accepted as reliable.
<P>

203	Mr Nolan's evidence was that he had not turned his attention to the
question of the value of the herd or the valuing of the
herd until about 21
July 1998, being the date when he wrote his letter of advice to the receiver as
to how the herd might be dealt
with in conjunction with the property.
<P>

204	Mr Nolan's evidence was that he anticipated as a mode of realisation, that
buyers be informed first of all that the buyer of
the land could also acquire
the plant, equipment and stock.  He was reminded that in his submission to the
receiver, he had said
that `a detailed livestock schedule with values would be
prepared and included in the information memorandum'.   His evidence was
that
this was his thinking at the time he prepared the submission to the receiver
and that this was because he considered that it
was desirable that people
considering whether they were interested in Jeogla should be told, first of all
`if you buy the land you
will have the right to buy the cattle', and secondly
`it won't be in a competitive situation against other people, you will have
the
right to buy them at a particular predetermined price.  [T284-285]
<P>

205	His evidence was that his thinking was that it would be necessary for the
predetermined nominated price to be communicated to
potential purchasers so
that they could work out what their total budget might be in relation to a
purchase of Jeogla and the cattle.
<P>

206	As to the promotional material, Mr Nolan accepted that the material which
he went forward with into the market place, started
to be circulated in early
August and comprised brochures and newspaper advertisements and entries in the
Hooker magazine in relation
to rural land.  This was backed by the prospect of
sending out an information memorandum to persons who had expressed an interest
in the property.  Mr Nolan accepted that in the first line of advertising
material, that is say the brochures, newspapers and magazine
entries, it was
not stated that the property was being offered with the option to acquire the
stock at a predetermined price, but
simply stated that the buyer would have the
opportunity to acquire the stock or an option to buy the stock according to
which publication
one looked at.  He accepted that in the information
memorandum, it was again disclosed that while the purchaser would have the
opportunity
or the option to acquire the livestock, it was not stated that it
would be at a predetermined price or as to what that price was.
 [T285]
<P>

207	Mr Nolan accepted that it was not until some time late in August that he
had any figures from the receiver in relation to the
price at which the stock
might be offered to the market.  He was asked whether he addressed himself to
the question as to what prices
might be realised for the stock sold, for
example, through a dispersal sale or sold in a line or in lots as a breeding
herd or sold
into the meat market.  His answer was in the negative and that his
recommendation was to use Elders to predetermine the value of
the livestock.
Mr Nolan had wanted to divorce himself from the situation and had recommended
the receivers to use Elders because
they were previously Mr Wright's stock
agents and knew the livestock.
<P>

208	Mr Nolan was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	. . . I am just trying to step you through the ingredients of it to
make sure we all understand how your thought process worked.
 </i><cite>Your
first proposition is that the buyer of land in securing the land at a dispersal
sale or seeking to secure the cattle at a dispersal
sale, would be confronted
with paying a premium?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Correct</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the premium you refer to is whatever bid is necessary, whether it be
$1 or $5 to take the bid price for the beast above the
price that other
purchasers or potential purchasers of the cattle were prepared to pay?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Which premium may or may not be offset by the proposition that if you
are having an on-station dispersal sale of these animals
through the Jeogla
sale yards, that same purchaser will not have to incur costs and will not have
to incur risks that other potential
purchasers of that livestock would incur,
or would in acquiring the cattle on Jeogla?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There would be some savings, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So he has, in effect, an absolute cost advantage, relative to other
purchasers who are away from Jeogla in varying degrees . .
.?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	. . . Yes, I agree he has an advantage, but no because of what we were
discussing earlier.'    </i>[T 288-289]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

209	Mr Nolan was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Did you . . . consider what the value of the herd disposed of in the
dispersal sale context might be, relative to the price that
one might nominate
in the contract?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No sir, because the livestock were being left to be valued by
Elders.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But you see did you suggest (sic) that Elders ought be asked to advise
whether, in the pricing of the stock, they were to price
at the dispersal sale
value or at something less than dispersal sale value, or what?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I didn't see any documentation in relation to the instructions, but
</i><cite>I was verbally told that they were asked to provide a premium on the
livestock</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	A premium over what?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well see I didn't see any instructions but I was - I believed there was
a market value and a premium value put on the cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Were you told that the premium was a premium over the meat value of the
cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	You mean the hanging up on the abattoirs?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I am sure that would have been the case sir, I have no doubt.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because as you understood . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	A.	On the breeding herd I am talking about.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>As you understood the breeding herd would command a
substantial premium over its mere meat value</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>I would imagine sir, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Because as you have said these were well bred, proven
breeders, that commanded a premium in the market?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes sir</cite><i>.'</i>   [T 289-290]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

210	Mr Nolan had had experience in dealing with livestock and had had
experience with the sale of large numbers of quality breeding
cattle.  He
accepted that what the receiver had in the Jeogla sale was a very large number
of very high quality animals.  He was
then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And a sale that you would expect to attract attention from purchasers
of, or potential purchasers, of breeding cattle from the
East Coast of
Australia and probably further afield?</i>
<P>

<i>	A..	</i><cite>I was actually surprised that we didn't receive more phone
calls just about the livestock.  We received - in the marketing of the
whole
property we received very few calls just purely on the livestock, which I was
surprised about.</cite><i>'  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

211	His experience was clearly that he received very few enquiries simply about
the livestock.  He accepted that it was correct
to say that in the marketing
campaign that was constructed, it was never suggested that the livestock herd
was for sale as a separate
component.  He accepted that the advertising that he
mounted at best suggested that the livestock <u>might</u> come up for
consideration after Jeogla Station had been disposed of.  [T291]
<P>

212	Mr Nolan accepted that he expected that the number and type of purchasers
interested in the Jeogla herd, or parts of it, would
be a substantially larger
number and a substantially wider range of purchasers, than those who would be
interested simply in the
land or the land plus the cattle.  [T 291]
<P>

213	Mr Nolan accepted that as he understood it, people who already had
properties of their own, might simply wish to buy one or
two hundred animals to
add to their herd or to change the direction of the property or to improve or
enhance it.  That was the sort
of purchaser that he would have expected to
appear at a clearance sale such as a dispersal sale of a herd such as the one
on Jeogla.
 He accepted that no advertising at all was directed to the prospect
of the cattle herd being realised separately from the land.
 [T291-292] 
<P>

214	The advertisement that appeared in the paper had simply said:
`Comprehensive list of livestock and plant available'.  There
was no separate
advertisement for livestock.  [T292]
<P>

215	He was then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	 . . . So is this right, that apart from whatever was obtained by the
receiver from Elders, you undertook no separate appraisal
of the cattle as to
the best methods for realisation of the cattle, or the prices that might be
obtained?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you undertook no separate exposure of the cattle to the market as an
item for sale to determine the nature and extent of interest
in the cattle in
the market?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And one of the matters that you observed was that, contrary to your
expectations, you got relatively few enquiries concerning
the cattle
simpliciter as a result of the advertising that was carried on?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So is this right;  that as you understood it as you came up towards the
auction, the persons likely to appear at the auction were
either those
interested only in the land, and not interested in buying the cattle at all, or
those interested in buying the land
and buying the cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Mm </i>[which I interpret as yes].<i>'</i>
<P>

216	Mr Nolan was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Well, presumably you had some people who you couldn't tell whether they
were interested in the cattle or not?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, as I said earlier sir, no one really indicated they were.     . .
. </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . As I understood your last answer to me, you are saying
</i><cite>you were getting no independent enquiry concerning the
cattle</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Very few.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Very little independent enquiry concerning the
cattle</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Right</cite><i>.'</i>   [T293]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

217	Mr Nolan at transcript 294 gave evidence that he would have assumed that
Elders had put a premium on the cattle.  He believed
that the value that Elders
put on the cattle would have been a premium, based on dispersal sale or based
on just cattle being sold
wherever.
<P>

218	At transcript 295, Mr Nolan was referred to his option (a) in his letter.
He was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And it is the prospect of getting more than dispersal sale prices that
you thought would be disincentive to the purchaser of the
land, or having to
pay more than dispersal sale prices that you thought might be the disincentive
to the purchaser in your alternatives
(a) and (b)?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think in this case the purchaser would want to know the destiny of the
livestock and plant, yes.'</i>  [T295]
<P>

219	Mr Nolan gave evidence that he assumed that the value that would be
nominated for the cattle in advance of the auction would
be an approximation of
the sale price of those cattle in a well organised dispersal sale and that,
therefore, he assumed that people
having seen that value and seen the schedules
of the descriptions of the livestock and so forth would come to the auction
unafraid
of any premium or being held to ransom, as he had described in his
alternatives (a) and (b).  His evidence was :
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And would simply bid what they considered to be the proper value for
the land?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So your theory of the sale, if you like, was that you could get the
market to reveal its real appraisal of the land by taking
out of the equation,
risk in relation to the value of the livestock, but sell the livestock for its
proper value?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes sir.   . . . I would imagine [Elders] would have been instructed to
put a premium on the cattle . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>The premium that you're referring to, I take it, is the
premium to reflect the breeding of the cattle and so forth, which premium
you
would expect to be realised in a dispersal sale</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes sir</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And when you describe it as a premium, take it [sic] you mean as an
increment in addition to the price to reflect the quality
of the herd and its
status as a prime breeding herd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes sir.'</i>    . . .
<P>

<i>	`Q.	You assumed market value struck according to the appropriate market for
the description of the cattle on Jeogla?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>    [T 298-299]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

220	At transcript 302, Mr Nolan gave the following evidence in
cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And indeed you assumed for the purposes of your work in relation to
this auction, that the option was price neutral, that is to
say the market
value was approximately the same as the exercise price of the option?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Considering the time frame of the valuation of the livestock it would be
fair to say that it was stable.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So you assumed that the option had no particular value in the equation
that you were dealing with at the auction sale on the 22nd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In other words did the cattle get dearer?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	No, you assumed that the cattle market value was approximately the same
as the contract price?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well that is what we were provided by Elders, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And therefore you have assumed that the option had no particular value,
the only . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I didn't say that, I think the option of acquiring the cattle would
have a value.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It's principle value was it excluded the forms of risk that you have
referred to in (a) and (b) of your letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And therefore, I take it, you assumed that the prices being bid for the
land on 22nd September reflected simply the value of the
land, unaffected by
the value of the cattle . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	. . . I believed that the land was bid on the basis that everybody - the
successful purchaser would have known what his destiny
was in relation to the
livestock and plant.'</i>  [T302]
<P>

221	Mr Nolan gave evidence that the property was passed in at the auction.
<P>

222	Mr Nolan could not recall whether, in the introduction to the auction and
during the conduct of the auction, the price that
the cattle were being offered
had not been separately referred to as part of the auction `spiel'.  A video of
Jeogla Station auction
was tendered which is accepted by the defendants as
making plain that this was indeed the case.  [P17]
<P>

223	After the property was passed in at the auction, there was some short
discussions between Mr Nolan and the receiver and he then
returned to his
office.  He had phone contact in regard to the offer that was subsequent to the
property being passed in and then
the eventual purchaser had contact with the
receivers and a sale was agreed upon.
<P>

	<b>Mr D. Graham  </b>
<P>

224	 Mr Graham is a cattle breeder who deposed that he had developed
substantial expertise in breeding, purchasing and selling cattle
and in
particular Hereford cattle.  He deposed that he had been involved in purchasing
cattle and assessing and analysing the quality
of cattle and their value for
about 35 years.  [Affidavit 24 December 1998 paragraph 1]
<P>

225	Mr Graham deposed that he had first purchased Hereford breeders from Jeogla
Station in the 1970's and had purchased hundreds
of those cows from that time.
He deposed that his father had purchased Hereford breeders from the Jeogla
Station back in the 1950's.
<P>

226	Mr Graham deposed that on or about 6 August 1998, he noticed an
advertisement in `the Land' newspaper, advertising the auction
of Jeogla
Station which caught his eye as he knew the property well and had purchased
cattle from it in the past.  He deposed that
he was very interested in putting
a syndicate together to buy the property as he knew the property as a leading
cattle breeding property
with an International Quality Assurance Approval also
having Cattlecare Accreditation and the superior V1V Hereford Beefmaker
brand.
<P>

227	He deposed that on the basis of his experience with similar properties and
knowledge of the qualities of Jeogla he formed a
view as to the value of the
property.
<P>

228	Mr Graham deposed that he telephoned Mr Paul Watts of PR Watts &amp; Co,
Stock and Station Agents who was named in the advertisement
as an agent for
Jeogla and said to Mr Watts:  "I am interested in Jeogla.  I see you are
handling the sale.  What do you think it
is worth".
<P>

229	Mr Graham deposed that Mr Watts had replied that in Mr Watts' view it was
worth about $500 an acre which made it $8million but
that this did not include
the cattle.
<P>

230	Mr Graham deposed that he had formed a view, given the quality of the
livestock on the property, that the property `lot, stock
and barrel' was worth
around $10million.  [Affidavit 24 December 1998, paragraph 12]
<P>

231	This paragraph in his affidavit was admitted as evidence of his state of
mind at the time, as distinct from his expert opinion
as to value at the
date.
<P>

232	Mr Graham deposed that a few days later he contacted Mr Nolan of LJ Hooker
Real Estate who were also named in the advertisement
as agents for the sale of
the property.  He deposed that a conversation took place in which words to the
following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	I am interested in Jeogla.  What price do you think the
property will be auctioned at?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	At about $5-$6million not including the stock and plant.  I will
send you a catalogue.'</i>
<P>

233	Mr Graham deposed that on or about 20 August 1998, he received documents
from Mr Nolan which included a catalogue and an LJ
Hooker flier.  Those
documents, annexed to his affidavit, comprised what is generally referred to in
this affidavit as the information
memorandum and a flier or circular
advertising the forthcoming auction.  I note that the flier stated, inter alia:
`An added bonus
for the successful purchase of Jeogla Station will be the
opportunity to purchase the livestock and plant and equipment currently
on the
property'.  There was no statement in the flier to the effect that there was a
right of first refusal or such a right at a
predetermined price.
<P>

234	Mr Graham deposed that soon after he had received these documents, he
contacted Mr McEvoy, a business associate whom he had
dealt with many times
before in relation to the purchase and development of properties.  Evidence was
admitted of this conversation
as proving that it took place and not as proof of
the truth of the underlying facts stated in it.  In the conversation deposed,
Mr
Graham gave evidence that he had said to Mr McEvoy:  "Jeogla Station at
Armidale is going to auction.  They are saying it will go
for about $5-6million
without the stock.  The stock are very good quality.  I think the whole thing
is worth about $10million.  I
think you should consider it."
<P>

235	Mr Graham deposed that he and Mr McEvoy then discussed the matter
generally, discussing matters such as the value of the property,
the stock
inspection and other such matters.  These types of discussions are said to have
occurred on a few occasions in about August
to September 1998.
<P>

236	Mr Graham then deposed that on about Friday 18 September 1998, he spoke
with Mr McEvoy and they proposed to call the agent with
a view to placing an
offer for the property.
<P>

237	Mr Graham deposed that later on the same day he had telephoned Mr Nolan
and, words to the following effect, were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	My associate, Mr McEvoy, and I are interested in purchasing
Jeogla, and would be interested in an offer of $9milllion
to buy the Station
and the livestock.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	There is another party who is very interested in purchasing the
property and it is likely that this party will purchase
the and [sic] the
property will not go to auction as planned on 22 September 1998.'</i>
<P>

238	Mr Graham deposed that he then said the following words, thinking that
perhaps Mr Nolan's negative response was linked to the
value of his offer:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	At what price would the property be sold at?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	Please keep me informed about progress of the sale.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	I will keep you informed.'</i>
<P>

239	Mr Nolan denied having any such conversation with Mr Graham.
<P>

240	Mr Graham then deposed that on Monday 21 September 1998, he had again
contacted Mr Nolan and words to the following effect were
said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	We would like a copy of the contract.  We want to place a
formal offer of $9 million for the property and livestock.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	It is highly likely the property will sell before auction, but I
will send you a contract.'</i>
<P>

241	Mr Nolan denied having any such conversation with Mr Graham.
<P>

242	A contract was in fact sent to Mr McEvoy, so Mr Graham deposed.  Mr Graham
deposed that it had arrived in the late afternoon
of Monday 21 September
1998.
<P>

243	Mr Nolan had given evidence that on 21 September 1998 he received a
telephone call from Mr Graham who had said to him:  "I would
like you to
urgently arrange for a contract to be sent to Mr Michael McEvoy of the McEvoy
Development Group in Liverpool".  Mr Nolan
had given evidence that he had said
he would arrange for that to be done straight away.
<P>

244	Mr Graham deposed that, having had the conversations earlier referred to
and set out in his affidavit with Mr Nolan, he formed
the view that it was
unlikely that the property would go to auction as there was an interested buyer
who would purchase the property.
 He deposed that accordingly he did not, nor
did any agent of his, attend the auction on 22 September 1998.
<P>

245	Mr Graham deposed that on Tuesday 22 September 1998, he was informed that
the auction had gone ahead and that the property had
been passed in at
$5.75million and that he then contacted Mr Nolan and asked how much the
property sold for and Mr Nolan had responded,
saying words to the effect that
"the property has not been sold, however negotiations are currently under way
and it is likely that
the property will be sold soon".
<P>

246	Mr Nolan denied receiving any telephone call from Mr Graham on 22 September
1998.  He gave evidence that the contracts for the
sale of Jeogla and its
livestock and plant and equipment were exchanged late in the evening on that
day.  His evidence was that the
first phone call he received from Mr Graham was
on 23 September 1998 after the contracts had been exchanged, when a
conversation
to the following effect took place.
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	I was interested in purchasing Jeogla Station.  I understand it
was passed in at auction.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	It was passed in but has since been sold.  Contracts were
exchanged yesterday.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	Well I want to buy it for $9 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	The property has already been sold and is not on the market.
Contracts have been exchanged.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	Mr McEvoy of McEvoy Development Group was actually at the
auction.  In his opinion, the property was knocked down very
quickly at the
close of bidding.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	The property was passed in - it was not sold under the hammer at
the auction.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	I can bring you in a bank cheque for the amount of the
deposit.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:	The property has been sold.  There is no point in pursuing
this.'</i>
<P>

247	Mr Nolan deposed that subsequently, Mr Graham had again telephoned him and
that he had at that stage told Mr Graham to contact
the receiver.
<P>

248	Mr Graham deposed that he had contacted Mr McEvoy after speaking with Mr
Nolan on 22 September 1998 and informed Mr McEvoy of
his conversations with Mr
Nolan and suggested to Mr McEvoy that they urgently send an offer to Mr Nolan
for $9million to purchase
the property and livestock.  This section of Mr
Graham's affidavit was admitted only as proving the conversation and not as
proving
the facts stated in the conversation as correct.
<P>

249	On 23 September 1998, M &amp; A McEvoy Development Group forwarded an offer
to the receiver's office.  The offer was conditional
upon certain matters, to
purchase Jeogla and Bald Hills Stations together with plant, equipment and
livestock for a total purchase
price of $9million, including the land component
of Bald Hills and Jeogla Stations;  including the livestock and plant and
equipment
as set out respectively in the contract for sale of livestock
prepared by Norton Smith &amp; Co. and the contract for sale of plant
and
equipment prepared by the same firm of solicitors.  [PX 1601]
<P>

250	Mr Graham deposed that later on the same day, that is to say 23 September
1998, he had contacted Mr Skinner and asked Mr Skinner
if the property had been
sold and if so, for how much.  His evidence was that Mr Skinner's response was
that he could not reveal
how much the property had been sold for but that it
had been sold.
<P>

251	Mr Graham further deposed that on 24 September 1998, he again contacted Mr
Skinner and a conversation took place in which words
to the following effect
were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	Have you received a formal offer to purchase Jeogla from M
&amp; A McEvoy Development Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:	Thank you I have received the offer but unfortunately the
property has been sold . . .  If the contract does not go through
I will let
you know.'</i>
<P>

252	According to Mr Graham, Mr Skinner informed him that Mr Skinner would
formally respond to the offer in due course.
<P>

253	Mr McCarthy deposed that he believed that the conversation to which Mr
Graham referred was with Mr Chris Campbell, a partner
of Deloittes and himself,
as Mr Skinner was overseas on leave at the time.  Mr McCarthy recalled
receiving a telephone call from
Mr Graham on 24 September 1998 which he
transferred to Mr Campbell.  Mr Campbell took the call as a conference call so
that Mr McCarthy
could hear the conversation.  He McCarthy recalled the
conversation as one in which words to the following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	I want to buy Jeogla Station.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Campbell:	Sorry Mr Graham, the auction was yesterday and the property
has been sold.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	What did it sell for?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Campbell:	I'm sorry I cannot tell you the contract is subject to
confidentiality provisions.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	I will offer you $9 million for the property and for the
plant.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Campbell:	The property has already been sold and it is subject to
contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	You are under an obligation to accept the highest price.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Campbell:	You're too late.  The property went to auction yesterday, it
was passed in but we negotiated with the highest bidder.
 Contracts have now
been exchanged.  I will note your interest.  If the contract doesn't complete
for any reason we will contact
you.'</i>
<P>

254	Mr McCarthy's evidence was that within a few days after that conversation,
he received a message on his voice mail to the following
effect:
<P>

	<i>`David, this is Rick Wright speaking.  I have been contacted by Dudley
Graham.  I am not sure who he is, but he is interested in purchasing
Jeogla.
Someone should follow up with him.'</i>
<P>

255	Mr McCarthy's evidence was that Mr Wright did not leave a telephone number
where Mr McCarthy should contact him.
<P>

256	Mr Campbell deposed that he recalled a telephone conversation with Mr
Graham on 23 September 1998 at which Mr McCarthy was present
and in the course
of which the following was said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	I want to offer $9 million to purchase Jeogla and Bald Hills
Stations.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Campbell:	Contracts for the sale of the Jeogla properties were exchanged
yesterday and therefore I cannot deal with your offer.
 If the contracts do not
settle I will let you know.'</i>
<P>

257	Mr Graham also deposed that he had been involved in breeding Hereford
cattle for 35 years approximately and that during that
time the Jeogla Station
cattle had been a famous Hereford breeding property producing superior quality
cattle.  In his experience,
a breeding herd was always sold on a per head
basis, whereas cattle sold as meat to the meatworks, were sold on a per
kilogram basis.
<P>

258	Mr Graham also deposed that if the V1V Jeogla Breed Herd was to be sold,
that in his opinion, would produce a very rare opportunity
for cattle producers
to purchase a superior breeding herd or part thereof.  He deposed that such a
large dispersal sale would have
created substantial interest throughout New
South Wales and Australia.  His evidence was that it is rare that you can buy
cattle
which have the benefit of years of superior breeding and genetics and
that, based on his experience, persons would have widespread
and substantial
competitive interest in the opportunity to purchase the breeding cattle from
Jeogla.
<P>

259	Mr Graham also deposed that he believed the best place to sell the stock
would have been on Jeogla Station property through
its sale facilities.  He
deposed that he believed that appropriate advertising of a disposal sale,
giving two months' notice to potential
purchasers, would have led to successful
sales.  He deposed that in late November 1998, he had sold some of his Hereford
cattle from
his breeding herd for $500 per head through the Wodonga Saleyards.
He deposed that those cattle were not as good a quality as the
Jeogla cattle
and that he believed that the Jeogla breeding cattle could easily have obtained
$700 per cow.
<P>

260	In relation to Mr Graham's evidence of his first telephone conversation to
Mr Watts, Mr Watts denied having that telephone conversation
but did give
evidence that, according to his records, he first spoke with Mr Graham on 18
August 1998, this also being his recollection.
 Mr Watts deposed that, in this
conversation, words to the following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Graham:	My name is Dudley Graham.  I have known the Wrights from Jeogla
Station for many years and have bought thousands of cattle
from them over those
years.  I am trying to locate the Wrights.  Do you know where they are?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Watts:	No I don't.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	I understand that you are one of the agents acting on the sale
of Jeogla Station.  How much do you think it is worth?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Watts:	Country in the New England is making between $300 and $700 an
acre depending on size and location and soil types.  Jeogla
Station is in a
good area, is well run and has good stock and I believe it will sell well at
auction.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	So it would be worth $500 an acre?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Watts:	I really can't say how much it would go for.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	But it would be worth about $500 an acre?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Watts:	A price of $500 an acre means that the property would be sold for
$8million excluding stock.  I do not think that is right
but the property will
sell well at auction.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Graham:	So you think it would go for $500 an acre?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Watts:	I did not say that.  You said that.  If you are interested in the
property, I will send you a brochure.  You can then come
up and inspect Jeogla
Station then we will talk about values.'</i>
<P>

261	In giving evidence in chief, Mr Graham accepted a deal of Mr Watts' version
of the conversation but insisted that he had said
to Mr Watts that a price of
$500 an acre would imply about $8million as to the value of the whole property.
According to Mr Graham,
when he told Mr Watts that the property was worth about
$500 an acre, Mr Watts did not second his opinion.
<P>

262	Under cross-examination, Mr Graham gave evidence that he made just the one
offer of $9million to Mr Nolan rather than two offers
to Mr Nolan.  [T 164]
<P>

263	He was asked whether he informed Mr Nolan on Friday 18 September that he
was interested in making an offer of $9million to buy
the Station and the
livestock.  This is, of course, what he had deposed to in paragraph 16 of his
affidavit.  His answer was that
he did not recall discussing the matter then
but had discussed the matter with Mr Nolan on the Monday (which was the 21st of
September).
<P>

264	His evidence included:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You did not say on Friday 18 September, that your associate, Mr McEvoy,
and yourself are interested in purchasing Jeogla and would
be interested in an
offer of $9million to buy the station and the livestock;  is that
correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	We discussed that and that was the verbal offer.  It wasn't on paper.
But what day, I think it was a Monday.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And there was only one such conversation, was there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	At that one time, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you didn't have any such conversation with Mr Nolan on the Friday
before the auction - that is, on 18 September 1998 - is
that what you tell the
Court?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not that I can recall.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You tell his Honour, do you that on the Monday before the auction, you
contacted Mr Nolan and you told him you wanted to place
a formal offer for
$9million for the property and the livestock;  is that what happened?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's true.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that was the only occasion, was it, on which the figure of $9million
was mentioned in a conversation with Mr Nolan;  is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Only mentioned it once?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Once on that phone call.    . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But prior to the auction you only mention the $9million once, is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And it didn't happen on Friday 18 [the transcript includes a typographic
error here] September, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not that I can recall, no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, have a look at paragraph 16 of your affidavit on page 4 . . . Do
you see in the first sentence you have sworn that you told
Mr Nolan that your
associate, Mr McEvoy, and yourself were interested in purchasing Jeogla and
would be independent in an offer of
$9million to buy the Station and the
livestock, that's what you swore to, correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I can see that there.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, that paragraph is entirely false, isn't it Mr Graham?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm not saying it is and I'm not saying it isn't.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well it's a simple question, is it true or is it false?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The time might be wrong, but it's not false.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It only happened once?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It only happened once.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, let me put it to you this way;  you had only one conversation with
Mr Nolan prior to the auction in which you mentioned
the figure of $9million;
is that correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And it wasn't on the Friday?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well I'm not too sure, okay, its a long time ago.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, have a look at paragraph 18 of your affidavit on page 5.  Do you
see that you said there you told Mr Nolan, "We'd like a
copy of the contract,
we want to place a formal offer of $9million for the property and the
livestock.  Is that correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	True.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In your affidavit you've sworn that the figure of $9million was
mentioned twice in your conversations with Mr Nolan prior to the
auction,
haven't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, well that must be true.  It's only a small thing to me.'
</i>[T164-166]
<P>

265	It was then put to Mr Graham that his affidavit was a tissue of lies and
that he had given quite inconsistent evidence in his
affidavit to that given in
the witness box.  His answer was that it was all in the affidavit in black and
white and he denied that
the affidavit was a tissue of lies.
<P>

266	In further cross-examination, it was put to Mr Graham that his evidence
that on the Friday he had spoken with Mr Nolan, who
had said that another party
was very interested in purchasing the property and that it was likely that that
party would purchase
the property which would not go to auction as planned on
22nd September 1998 was totally false.  Mr Graham denied that this was false.
The evidence included:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Do you seriously suggest that Mr Nolan did not express any interest in
talking to you about your offer of $9million is that what
you say?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That's just not true is it Mr Graham?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It is true.'</i>
<P>

267	Mr Graham also admitted that he himself did not have any funding in place
to purchase the property and the cattle for $9million
as at 22 September 1998.
He said that he was not organising the funding but that it was to be organised.
He was then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You were seeking to put together some syndicate were you, to purchase
this property?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the details of that syndicate hadn't been finalised as at 22
September?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I didn't fully know where - how will I put it?  I wasn't doing the
funding, put it that way, no.  It was being organised, I know
that, yes.
. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	There was no letter addressed to you prior to 22 September 1998 which
recorded any offer by any bank or institution of the sum
of $9million for the
purchase of the property and the cattle, was there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.  Well, when you fund anything you always have the offer before you
start putting your money together is the way I've always
approached it.      .
. .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You agree with me then, do you, that there was no offer made to you or
to anybody else that was going to join with you in the
purchase of this
property for the funding of the purchase of $9million for the cattle and the
real estate, was there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

268	Mr Graham was also asked :
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You see, the reason you were not interested in purchasing this property
at the auction was because you wanted more time to be
able to see whether you
could get the funds in place to purchase the property;  that's right, isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That is true but it could be done.  It could be done.  There was no
problem about it.'</i>
<P>

269	I do not accept Mr Graham as having given reliable evidence.  I was not
impressed by his demeanour in the witness box.  He departed
from his sworn
evidence given on affidavit in relation to the number of occasions when, on his
affidavit evidence, the so-called
$9million offer was made.  I formed the clear
view that Mr Graham's evidence should be rejected and it is rejected.  Nothing
which
Mr Graham said, unless corroborated by other evidence generally in the
case, may be relied upon.  To the extent, however, that Mr
Graham gave evidence
that Jeogla Station cattle had been a famous Hereford breeding property
producing superior quality cattle during
the time in which he had been involved
in breeding Hereford cattle for 35 years, this evidence may be accepted as it
is corroborated
by much other evidence and indeed, there did not seem to be a
real issue raised by the bank or by the receiver on this topic.

1986 he had been owner/manager of a property of some 4,000 acres in the
Houghton Valley
which had included mixed grazing and farming, carrying 300
breeding cattle and 1500 wethers.
<P>

272	From 1986 to January 1987, he had been executive assistant to the Chairman
of the New South Wales Meat Industry Authority. 
From January 1987 to July
1989, he had been Executive Officer of the Meat and Livestock, New South Wales
Farmers Association.  From
July 1989 to May 1990 he had been Deputy Director of
the Cattle Council of Australia.  From May 1990 to October 1995, in his
capacity
as Executive Director of the Cattle Council of Australia, his
responsibilities and activities had included many aspects of work on
issues
affecting the beef - cattle/red meat industry including ministerial
correspondence and correspondence with departmental officers
and other contacts
of official capacity.  He had maintained a close dialogue with senior federal
bureaucrats in the Department of
Primary Industries and Energy.  He had
maintained a close liaison with the industry funded statutory corporation and
had represented
the Council on numerous steering committees within the Meat
Research Corporation and contributed to the promotional planning process
undertaken by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation.  He had
represented the Cattle Council at various domestic and international
public
engagements and at various enquiry hearings, including Senate Standing
Committees, Caucus Primary Industry Committee and Coalitions
Primary Industry,
Regional Development and Local Government Committees.
<P>

273	From November 1995 to June 1998, he had been Manager, Food Safety and
Quality Assurance, Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation.
 And from July
1998 to the present time he had been General Manager, Corporate Affairs Meat
and Livestock Australia in which regard
his responsibilities and activities
included maintaining a relationship with livestock levy payers and community
groups connected
with meat and livestock industry.
<P>

274	Mr Palmer's evidence was that the Cattlecare On-farm Quality Assurance
Training Programme (`Cattle Care') is a quality assurance
programme.  To ensure
accreditation, the producer has to achieve a cattle care standard.  This is
done by an external accreditation
audit.  There are subsequent audits every
year.
<P>

275	Mr Palmer's evidence is accepted as reliable.
<P>

276	His evidence was that the Cattle Care Programme aims to produce beef that
will be effectively guaranteed to be safe and in accordance
with the
internationally accepted Food Safety Plan called `HACCP (Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point').
<P>

277	Mr Palmer's evidence was that the ISO9002 are international quality
assurance standards that are internationally developed and
recognised.  That
accreditation is a more stringent accreditation than Cattle Care because it
involves compliance with the various
international standards of quality
assurance and the total quality management system and the cattle producer has
to meet ISO requirements.
 His evidence was that there are only between three
to six rural producers in Australia with ISO9002 accreditation and that there
are only approximately three cattle producers with that accreditation.
<P>

278	His evidence was that Cattle Care Accreditation and ISO9002 Quality
Assurance means that the producer who has such accreditation
and quality
assurance, has an improved management system and has improved production
performance.  His evidence was that the value
of the product that has such
accreditation and quality assurance is likely to increase because of such
accreditation and quality
assurance.
<P>

279	His evidence was that V1V Hereford Beefmaker Cattle are one of the very
highly regarded brands in the beef cattle market which
command a premium on
average beef cattle prices.
<P>

280	Mr Palmer was asked whether, in the course of his employment, he had had
opportunity to observe the market reception of meat
or cattle produced out of
farmers producing Cattle Care and/or ISO9002.  His evidence was:
<P>

	<i>`A.	The answer to that question is twofold.  There is the view of producers
involved in the program that they acquire a preferred
supplier status and at
times will create or will command a premium for the sale of those stock in the
marketplace.  Equally, the
processors, the buyers, not publicly but they will
state their preference, is to be buying stock from Cattle Care or similar
operations
because it gives them a confidence that those cattle are sound,
clean and are fit for purpose.'</i>  [T 104]
<P>

281	Mr Palmer gave evidence in relation to the market in relation to cattle
being sold for the purpose of purchase for further breeding
or use as breeding
stock in the industry.  His evidence dealt with the fact that the Australian
Beef Industry represents 2&#189;
% of the World's cattle population.  Australia
produces, he said, less than 4% of the World's beef and yet ships and trades
into
110 markets around the World.  Australia, he said, is the largest exporter
of those products.  His evidence was that each of those
markets have stringent
demands on Australian beef.  One, he said, was in the area of product
integrity, meeting high expectations
of customers and consumers.  Secondly,
there was the need for the cattle to meet tight specifications.  His evidence
was that each
of those markets have tight specifications which must be met in
the area of food safety area, the ISO9002.  The Cattle Care Programme
aimed at
the safety and cleanliness and purity of those products to customers and
consumers.  In relation to meeting the specifications
and the genetic
involvement, his evidence was that the genetic inputs to the cattle are
critical in meeting the tight specifications
to which he had referred.
<P>

282	Mr Palmer gave some evidence with respect to on-farm sales relating to the
market performance of V1V Beefmaker Cattle.  His
observation was that those
cattle commanded a premium over comparable store cattle in respect of age,
weight and type.  His evidence
was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Palmer in relation to the premium you said you had observed, are you
able to assist his Honour as to what extent or what, expressed
in whatever
denomination you can, that premium was that you observed?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I observed something in the order of 5-8cents on that particular sale
per kilo over corresponding cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And corresponding cattle, what price per kilo were they enjoying?  What
was the base price, if you like?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	My recollection for that sale was that the base price or the public
price was about $108 to $110 and these cattle were making
something around
$120.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So far as herds capable of producing the cattle, that two pronged
specification you referred to earlier, the integrity specification
one side;
the Cattle Care ISO9002 and the product time specifications on the other, that
are suitable for the export markets you
referred to.  In your observation, do
those herds have any characteristics in the market when they change
hands?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Most certainly . . .  One such market that we ship to is the European
Union and they have very clear stipulations and demands
and the difference from
value from that market to another market might be 4,000 to 5,000 a tonne and it
is about aiming and pitching
your herd around production at those markets which
can command a better price over other markets.'  </i>[T106-107]
<P>

283	Under cross-examination, Mr Palmer's evidence included the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	If cattle were sold from the Jeogla Station which cattle has an ISO9002
accreditation, the purchaser who purchases the cattle
and takes it to another
property, at least on that assumption, wouldn't necessarily get an ISO9002
accreditation would he?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Probably not.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It would depend entirely upon the management system employed by the
purchaser of the property, is that correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the same would apply to Cattle Care accreditation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.'</i>  [T108]
<P>

284	Mr Palmer was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	But there are requirements of the ISO9002 accreditation which are not
applicable to the Cattle Care accreditation, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I might reverse it.  Cattle Care is a subset of ISO.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So if you have the ISO9002 accreditation, would you automatically get
Cattle Care accreditation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>  [T110]
<P>

285	Mr Palmer was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You gave some evidence about a matter I asked you some questions about
a few minutes ago, that is the premium of 5-8 cents.  That
is per kilo is
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Of cattle.  When did this sale take place?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh, I hope this is right but I think it was April last year, I think but
I just can't remember I am sorry.  I have had invitations
and notices to every
V1 sale over many years.  I went to one last April I think.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Where did it take place?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	At the Jeogla saleyard . . . it might have been the year before . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What sort of cattle commanded that premium of 5 cents to 8 cents a
kilo?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There were steers and heifers being sold, 12-15 months old cattle, a
range of ages but something in the order of 10-15 months
of age and the trend
across the whole yard.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You had at the time some knowledge of what you then regarded as the
market price for that type of cattle is that correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I believe so.</i>'  [T111]
<P>

286	Mr Palmer gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And the premium that was attained was something in the order of what,
as far as you can recollect in general terms.  Five to perhaps
8 cents above
that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Five to 8 cents, I said.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Five to 8 cents.  Well, would you agree that in percentage terms the
premium was something less than 5-8%?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Going on the price of 120-odd cents on the day as compared to local
price, that is about the right percentage terms.'  </i>[T112]
<P>

287	Mr Palmer gave the following evidence under cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Will you not agree that if that is the premium which is applicable to
the turnover or product of the farm, that it would be quite
inappropriate to
attribute a higher premium to that which remains on the property?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>To bring in the herd, the breeding herd, which is not as we
are talking about as what stays behind is the breeding herd, in my view
and
based on the evidence over many years, is that the premium in those would be
far higher</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But would you not agree that the value of what one might regard as the
capital stock in the form of the cattle on the property
can only be reflected
by looking at the returns obtained for that cattle in sales such as production
sales?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It is partly reflected in the production produced, most
certainly.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>It wouldn't make any commercial sense whatsoever for somebody
who was looking at the purchase of the breeding cattle to pay a premium
of,
say, 50% for that cattle if it was only producing, when you sold the product, a
premium in the order of 5-8%, would it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Well, this is not the trend, this is not the outcome.  I am
sorry but the realities are, when you are buying a known gene pool there
are
very significant premiums to be paid and if there is only one buyer, you
wouldn't get the premium but if there are multiple buyers,
you will get it.
Since time began, good cattle fetch a premium.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The premium would not be out of proportion to the premium which is
applicable and which is attained on the sale of the product,
would it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, it will depend more on supply and demand at the time of the sale.'
</i>[T112-113]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

288	Under further cross-examination, Mr Palmer was tested on purchasers of a
herd.  The evidence was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	A person who sought to purchase a herd of cattle in the order of 5,000
would not be your average Pitt Street farmer would he?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.  I can't answer that one yes or no.  It would be seen as a great
asset to buy in this case and it would be open, if available.
 Five thousand
cattle in one line is not a usual purchase, if I can answer it that way.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The sort of person who would purchase a line of cattle of that size
would be confined to a fairly select group of people, would
that be
correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, they would be committed people once they owned them.  Again,
unfortunately I have to digress slightly, that those sorts
of numbers - it can
become a commodity if the price is right, so that encourages different people
for different purposes, but if
we are dealing with a breeder buying a line of
5,000 cattle, that is quite a unique occurrence.       . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>It would be foolhardy, wouldn't it, for somebody to purchase
that size of herd of cattle at a premium way out of proportion to the
sort of
premium that is being attracted at production sales for the cattle from that
property.  That's right isn't it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No, not necessarily, because we dealt with this question, a
little while ago.  That the genetic base inherent in the herd is only
partly
reflected in the product produced, and the price differentials would track
similarly to that partial allocation if you like,
to the genetic worth of the
production inherent in the herd</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>It would be a foolhardy decision to pay a premium of 50%,
wouldn't it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Well, it happens, I'm sorry it happens</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It would be an irrational decision to make, wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Commentators, not necessarily, it depends on what they are buying.  Some
who didn't have the view or the feel for it might say
they have paid too much,
others would say - I'm not talking about Jeogla, I am just talking about how
the market works, the cattle
market.  When you are dealing between production
animals and a breeding herd, the degree of rationality when purchasing top
quality
breeders is less rational, if you like, than when you are buying
animals that are on a clearly destined market path to an end consumer
market.
 . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Let me just approach it another way.  Would you not agree that the value
of the genetic pool diminishes if cattle is on sold from
a particular breeding
property to other breeding properties?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Would you not agree that if cattle is sold to a purchaser who takes it
to another breeding station, that the cattle is more likely
to be crossed with
different lines of cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Only to the degree of enhancing their own genetic material.  If I might
add, a purchase might be deliberately purchased in order
to enhance and build
upon the genetic base that was previously owned.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It might do something to improve the worth of the existing cattle on the
purchaser's property but it would be inclined to have
a downward impact on the
genetic value of the cattle that had been purchased from Jeogla, wouldn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No it would be complimentary.'</i>  [T113-115]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

289	In re-examination, the following was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	</i><cite>In relation to the premium that my learned friend was asking
you about in relation to the - he described it as well bred cattle, what
in
your experience are the characteristics that a breeder would be seeking to buy,
paying a premium for well bred cattle</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Well, they are looking for cattle whose progeny and products
will meet tight specifications in a range of markets around the world.
Specifications are set against yield, age, maturity, just a general yield of a
carcass to feed that particular market</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Does the efficiency of beast as a grower of beef affect the
equation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The efficiency of the products or the efficiency of the cow?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>The efficiency of a progeny of the herd to graze maturity
producing meat, is that a matter that will affect the premium you are referring
to</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>The overall efficiency of a herd and product in terms of its
eating and the way it deals with itself is physical to its own
purpose.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>What about the facility of the herd</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Absolutely</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The consistency of the products it produces?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	From the meat buyers point of view they are looking to buy even one line
of cattle that meets a particular market specification
and those that can
produce those one line cattle are sought after in the marketplace.'</i>  [T116]
[Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Mr G.R. Peart</b>
<P>

290	Mr Peart is a director of Hassall &amp; Associates, Agricultural
Consultants.  He is a Senior Agricultural Consultant who has
worked in that
field for 30 years.  He has a Masters Degree in Rural Science from the
University of New England and has been a registered
land valuer for the last 17
years.  His work includes acting as business manager for the marketing of rural
properties including
at December 1998, the marketing of a $7-8million property
in the Central West of New South Wales.
<P>

291	Mr Peart's affidavit dealt with the marketing of the subject property and
the marketing reports which had in fact been prepared
by Elders and LJ Hooker
Rural.  His evidence is accepted as reliable.
<P>

292	Mr Peart deposed that `fair market value' was, in his view, to be defined
as the price achieved between a willing but not anxious
buyer and a willing but
not anxious seller in an arms length transaction.  He deposed that fair market
value `is represented by the
contract price that can be achieved where a
property is formally marketed to the widest possible audience of appropriately
finance
potential buyers both within Australia and overseas.   . . .
Professional marketing will be essential in identifying potential buyers
and
will involve the preparation of such information as historical and projected
income figures, demographic and zoning status, where
necessary.  The seller
must assemble all the physical, financial and legal data to present both a
contract of sale and an information
memorandum to potential buyers.  Potential
buyers must be given ample time to carry out due diligence and prepare and
pursue finance
applications prior to auction or tender'.
<P>

293	Mr Peart deposed that he is familiar with the Jeogla property and
surrounding district and in particular aware of the manner
in which Mr Richard
Wright conducted the business.  He had gained this awareness through many years
of contact with the Wright family.
<P>

294	In Mr Peart's opinion, a marketing strategy that would have been
appropriate for a property of this type would include documentation
to contain
`the preparation of first class descriptive and advertising material that would
capture the interest and imagination of
a class of potential client who could
afford a property of this value (ie in the range $10million to $15million), the
assembly of
sufficient information from past performance to allow potential
buyers to carry out a due diligence and prepare and pursue finance
applications
and the preparation of a contract for sale which clearly set out the terms and
conditions, but allows some flexibility
to meet particular buyers' needs'.
[Affidavit 21 December 1998, paragraph 6]
<P>

295	Mr Peart deposed that Jeogla has a famous historic name and would be
recognised within the top 100 properties in New South Wales.
 He deposed that
the Wrights had the first registered Hereford cattle herd in Australia and that
the property has a secure rainfall
and a large economy of scale which would
make it attractive to investors across the whole of Australia and also
internationally.
 He deposed that the property is positioned on the Eastern
Falls country facing the ocean which ensures high and regular rainfall
as well
as easy access to the Central and North Coast of New South Wales and a large
well serviced university City of Armidale. 
He deposed that marketing needs to
be done at a highly professional level using all potential outlets of the
internet, print media,
mailing lists to keep potential investors of this scale
and warranted some television advertising.  He deposed as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The achievement of the ISO9002 status for the famous Jeogla Hereford
cattle herd dramatically reduces risks for the new buyer and
gives the property
a status and potential to earn premiums on its beef output not enjoyed by 99
percent of herds in Australia.  Well
marketed, this is likely to bring a
premium to the property particularly from risk averse city investors and
especially overseas
investors who have seen problems with chemical and disease
contamination of cattle in Europe and the USA.  The property is likely
to
attract a significant amount of overseas attention if marketed properly
internationally.'</i>  [Affidavit paragraph 8]
<P>

296	In dealing with the presentations of Elders and LJ Hooker, Mr Peart deposed
that Elders have an excellent branch network across
the country, have their own
branches in most major and many minor towns and their own agents in Armidale.
He then deposed `LJ Hooker
don't have this internal network and in the case of
marketing one of the best known properties on the New England, are using a
local
man to give the property profile and to run their inspections.  That
man's main profile is as a saleyard stockman and he has little
strength in land
selling, land knowledge and client relationships which are so important in
selling multi-million dollar properties'.
 [Affidavit paragraph 12(c)]
<P>

297	Mr Peart deposed as follows:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Facts that support the price</cite>
<P>

<i>	Jeogla Station is a famous specialist beef property and has the oldest
Hereford herd in Australia running on it.  Its computerised
cattle selling over
the last 15 years has made it well known across Eastern Australia.  It has
ISO9000 registration on the herd which
guarantees them as disease free and
chemical free and guarantees a whole chain of management events which makes for
increased profit.
 The herd is enrolled in Cattlecare and a whole management
team is in place to run this property for the sort of major rural, city
or
overseas investor who is likely to buy.'   </i>[Affidavit paragraph 12(d)]
<P>

298	In examining the two reports on which he was asked to comment, Mr Peart
rated both advertising proposals `as extremely minimalist
and totally
inadequate'.
<P>

299	Mr Peart deposed that he believed that a lead up time of a minimum of 4
months should be allowed for the marketing campaign
for the sale of Jeogla.
This time, he deposed, would have enabled the property to have been prepared,
and to have prepared the Information
Memorandum, the brochure, all the
advertising, flown press to the property, got editorial material in at the
start of the advertising
campaign, prepared the material to go onto the
internet, developed a mail out list of 500-800 people who were in the league to
buy
a property like this and to specifically target some 50 likely buyers is
the sort of campaign that would have brought the maximum
result for such an
outstanding property'.  [Affidavit paragraph 12(e)]
<P>

300	In summary, Mr Peart deposed as follows:
<P>

	<i>`In reviewing the two proposals I do not think the LJ Hooker proposal
should have been accepted when compared to the Elder proposal.
 The LJ Hooker
proposal on comparison with the Elders proposal envisaged a sale price of
$1.3million less, selling costs of $60,000
more and an advertising budget of
$10,000 less, resulting in a $1.4million lower result for the vendor.
Comparing the two assessments
on professionalism, targeted market, being seen
to be in with the right class of client who could afford this, on profile
through
the market, and on recent sales, then one would have to have selected
Elders without a doubt on every comparison.  However, I believe
that neither
proposal was satisfactory in regard to the quality and uniqueness of the
property'.  [Affidavit paragraph 12(f)]</i>
<P>

301	In giving evidence, Mr Peart was closely tested on what would occur at a
relevant auction and as to advantages and disadvantages
on several proposals.
He gave evidence that he had recently been involved in preparing the sale of a
property in the Macquarie River
District of some 52,000 acres, having 10,000
sheep and 1,700 cattle running on it - the cattle being a stable breeding herd
of short
horn cattle.  He was responsible for developing the marketing plan for
the sale of the cattle and the land.  
<P>

302	In relation to the cattle, Mr Peart gave evidence that the price was fixed,
by reference to the market, in `advance' of the
sale.  It is a situation in
which the markets referred to for the purpose of fixing the price of the cattle
were the sales of top
breeding herds and not meat value.  Information as to the
price of top breeding herds for the exercise he said, come from both dispersal
clearing sales of herd and from specialist auctions of breeders of high quality
breeders that take place around the cattle areas.
 Such prices are published in
The Land newspaper in New South Wales and similar rural press in all the other
states.  [T63]
<P>

303	In relation to this particular sale, his evidence was that he had regard to
prices in states other than New South Wales and
particularly Queensland,
because it is such an important cattle breeding state.  For a herd of 1700 size
he definitely expected interest
in such a herd from Queensland.  
<P>

304	Mr Peart gave evidence that he had also been involved in other transactions
where he was selling both land and substantial sized
commercial herds.  Some 6
or 8 months prior to the Macquarie River District situation, he had been
involved in a sale of approximately
500 cows and was presently representing the
purchaser in preparing the financial proposal to buy the herd.  That was a 500
head commercial
herd.  The information he looked at for the price, in so far as
pricing of this herd was concerned, was the specialist dispersal
sales and
specialist breeder sales market.  His evidence was :
<P>

	<i>`Q.	I take it that the animals on these properties to which you have
referred, they would be taken to market and sold simply as meat
to purchasers
of livestock for slaughter, if they are sold on that basis what, in your
experience, is the means by which the price
is calculated for such
animals?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	A purely weight times age times the current market price for
meat.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In your observation and experience does a price calculated that way for
the sort of beast that you were selling in the transactions
that you have
referred to, is the value you are putting on the animal greater than, equal to
or less than that which would be obtained
if it was sold simply as meat?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Greater than.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you give his Honour some assistance to what degree it may be greater
than the price of the animal as meat?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Depending on quality of the article that you are selling, 50%
premiums are often obtained, 100% premiums are sometimes obtained.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you are enjoying 100% premiums, in what circumstances has that
figure been arrived at?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Where the herd has the reputation, where the cattle are well presented,
where they have a known breeding history which one records
to say they have
calf each year, that they are within a restricted calving period.'  </i>
<P>

<i>	`Q.	Is a well-presented breeding animal an animal which is necessarily
well-presented for sale as meat?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.    . . .   A cow suckling a calf will be quite down in weight and
not ready for meat market at all but will still realise
the very top breeding
cow/calf price.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If you were to take such animals to market for meat, would you take the
calf off them and feed them up?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If that was the only way of disposing of the, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In what circumstances would you contemplate selling an active breeding
cow for meat?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The short answer is never.' </i>[T64-65]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

305	Under cross-examination, Mr Peart accepted that his instructions in
relation to the affidavit which he had made were instructions
only to comment
upon the marketing programme that he assumed had been followed for the sale of
Jeogla Station.  In short, he had
not made any effort to look at, as he was not
asked to look at, material that had actually been put before the public for
sale of
the property.  In those circumstances, he was shown the coloured
information memorandum in fact used in relation to the Jeogla sale
and he
accepted that it contained a number of important items including giving some
degree of prominence to the ISO and Cattle Care
accreditations, to the V1V
brand, to the famous name of the property, to the history of the property and
to the rainfall.  [T69-70]
<P>

306	Mr Peart was cross-examined in relation to the evidence which he gave in
chief, to the effect that it may be possible to obtain
a premium on the sale of
cattle if they are offered by way of a dispersal sale.  He was reminded that
the figures he had put on this
matter were up to 50% and in some cases even
100%.  That, he said, was a premium to be achieved over and above the meat
value.  He
was asked whether he consulted any documents before he made that
assessment and his answer was:  `Those sales and those sorts of
premiums are
regularly demonstrated in the Weekly Rural Press and I have been involved in
sales where premiums of 100% have been
achieved'.  [T71]
<P>

307	Mr Peart then referred to some specifics in that regard.
<P>

308	His evidence was that the premiums that exist for high quality existing
flocks and herds are always there which was demonstrated
in weekly marketing
records in the rural press.  His evidence was:  `Famous herds are rarely
dispersed'.  [T72]
<P>

309	At transcript page 74, the following appears in Mr Peart's
cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	When you are looking at purchase of a property of some 15,000 acres
with about 4 or 5,000 head of cattle, that is a fairly expensive
price tag that
the purchaser is looking to put forward for the purchase of the property and
the cattle, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The purchaser who knows he has a right of first refusal from your
experience would be looking at the maximum price that he would
be prepared to
pay for the whole of that package, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Only on the understanding that he has some idea of what the price of
cattle are going to be.  If it is totally open-ended, you
have the right of
first refusal of the cattle on no specified price, then the owner of the cattle
can specify any price.        .
. .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It would be clearly unwise to have a right of first refusal which does
not nominate a price at which that right of first refusal
can be exercised,
correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes, if that was so everyone who attended the auction should
have widely known what the asking price of the cattle was</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Mr Peart, would you agree that to offer the rural property for
sale at auction with a so-called right of first refusal which does
not spell
out the price at which the purchaser may exercise that right of first refusal,
would not be something which would be attractive
at all to a
purchaser</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>It makes - it introduces a large unknown into the financial
affairs of the prospective purchaser because he does not know at what
price he
may be able to purchase the cattle and he may lose that purchase in the
bargaining with the vendor</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The one thing that purchasers don't like when they are working out the
price that they may wish to pay for a property is financial
unknowns, would you
agree with that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>It would be a huge disadvantage in the reasoning process of
the prospective purchaser to have such a financial unknown is that
right</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.         . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So it would not be much good to a purchaser to put his hand up for a
price for half the formula without knowing what he was going
to have to pay in
order to secure the other half of the formula, that is right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It certainly puts pressure on him to pay a very high price for the
cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the one thing that the purchaser would want to avoid was to be put
into a position where he would be put under pressure for
the price he would
have to pay for the cattle that is right isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It would really be a disincentive to him to put up his hand to bid for
the real estate isn't that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'   </i>[T74-75]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

310	In re-examination, Mr Peart was asked whether in his observation of
dispersal sales, it was ordinarily the case that the whole
herd is sold as one.
His answer was:
<P>

	<i>`In a normal auction dispersal sale no, the herd is offered in total but it
is very rare for one purchaser to be able to successfully
purchase at public
auction the whole herd, so the only way to get the whole herd is to have it
under a contract.'</i>
<P>

311	He was then directed to the situation where land and cattle are to be sold
at a nominated price.  He agreed that if the cattle
price was too high, the
purchaser of the land may let the cattle fall to auction and pick them up
there.  His evidence was then:
<P>

	<i>Q.	</i><cite>Take the opposite situation if you would, where the price
nominated for the cattle is significantly under the market value of the
land,
is that in your estimation, an appropriate way to offer the land and cattle to
the market</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No.     . . . People judge the value of the land and the value
of the cattle almost totally in isolation.</cite><i>    . . .  Because they see
reported and they are judging all the time the value of their land, the value
at which they can purchase
land, that is reported by the Valuer General, they
all know the sales that are appropriate to their land that have gone on so they
estimate what they will have to pay for land and they are estimating from the
sales reports what the cattle herd is worth but </i><cite>I've never been
involved in a case where there was a sort of trade-off position between land
and stock</cite><i>.      . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now I think you said in answer to a question from my learned friend
concerning the pricing of the cattle in the assumed offer
of the land with the
cattle at a nominated price, it could be widely known what that price
is?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	By what mechanisms did you or what mechanisms did you have in mind as to
dissemination of that information when you gave that
answer?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, the most legally binding would be in my view to have it as part of
the contract of sale or that it be publicly announced
by the agents that the
cattle were available to be purchased at this price well prior to the auction
or at worst, announced at the
auction.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Is it information that you would consider material to an understanding
of the property advertised in brochures for the property?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, if the cattle are to be offered as part of the package deal,
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And in your experience is that material information to an understanding
of the value of the aggregate offer?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>   [T77-78]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Evidence given by Mr R.B.A. Wright</b>
<P>

312	Mr Wright in his affidavit of 10 December 1998, dealt with a number of the
background facts which are not in issue and have
already been set out in the
Judgment.  He set out his personal history and the fact that he had been born
on Jeogla Station in 1947
and had lived there his whole life except for a
number of years when he was in boarding school, a period as a `jackeroo' and
three
years of tertiary education.  He was not tested on his evidence that he
had accumulated the knowledge of the property and farming
in Australia
possessed by two former generations prior to his father and passed on to him
through his father and through reading
station diaries.  He was not tested on
paragraph 18 of his affidavit of 10 December 1998 in relation to which he had
stated that
he had gained extensive experience in numerous aspects of property
management including management of livestock, management of genetics
of cattle,
understanding of global cattle markets and trends, managing properties in
accordance with the ISO9002 and Cattle Care
standards and generally knowing
about the properties Hernani and Jeogla Station and how they operated and how
to operate them.
<P>

313	Mr Wright had spent all his life involved in the farming and grazing
industry and in particular in the beef cattle grazing industry.
 He had
attended cattle auctions since he was a child.  He had arranged the cattle
auctions at Jeogla Station since 1977.  He constantly
followed the prices of
cattle both in Australia and overseas.
<P>

314	Mr Wright's evidence is accepted as reliable.  Notwithstanding his obvious
interest in the proceedings, and although from time
to time being prone to
exaggeration, he impressed me as by and large doing his best to accurately
record the events in question and
to fairly express his opinions.
<P>

315	On about 1 April 1998, Mr Skinner had attended at Jeogla homestead together
with an employee of his firm, Mr David McCarthy.
 In the course of the
conversation at which Mrs Wright was also present, a number of matters were
dealt with.  A conversation was
admitted on a limited basis to prove the
communication of information as to how one might market the subject sales
insofar as Mr
Wright had had to pass on to Mr Skinner his comments, and insofar
as what the receiver or Mr McCarthy had had to say in the conversations,
those
statements being admitted as proving only what it is that was being sold and
for no other purpose.  [T 5]
<P>

316	In the course of this conversation, Mr Skinner referred to his appointment
as receiver and manager of Jeogla Pty Limited and
other companies in the group.
He stated that he would be managing the properties and would expect Mr Wright
to carry on the day to
day management with his staff who would also be spoken
to as to their future.
<P>

317	Mr Wright said words to the effect:  
<P>

	<i>"I would like some indication from you as to time frame.  I need to know
about what you propose as to sell down of cattle, the future
of Hernani and the
cattle on it and most importantly Jeogla.  You no doubt have become aware that
this enterprise is of national
importance and international significance.  I am
presently organising cattle for a sale that is to take place on 22 May 1998.  I
need to know from you what you propose to do with the cattle on Hernani because
some of them have to come down to Jeogla for the
sale.  The longer we wait to
move those cattle, the greater the risk of an animal welfare problem.   . . .".
</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner said:  " . . . I don't know the intricacies of this kind of
operation but if I have to no doubt I will find an expert
somewhere . .
.".</i>
<P>

<i>	. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright said:  "Tell me what you believe, with your knowledge and
experience as a receiver what a cow/calf area is worth?"  </i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner said:  "I have no idea".</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright said:  "Can you please tell me when you have in mind to sell
Jeogla".</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner said:  "In the spring."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright said:  "The breeding cows commence calving at Hernani on 1
August."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner said:  "So what?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright said:  "Any proposed sale should bear in mind that the cattle
will commence calving on 1 August.  If the cattle are moved
beforehand, or soon
thereafter, there would be problems with cows dying, this should be
avoided."</i>
<P>

318	Mr McCarthy denied the terms of the above described conversation.  He
deposed that the conversation which took place was to
the following effect:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Skinner:	I have been appointed as receiver and manager of Jeogla Pty
Limited, in its own capacity and as trustee for the BA Wright
Family Trust,
receiver of "Bald Hills" and receiver of Richardsons Arcade and Dumaresq
Street.  Here are copies of my appointment
documents, and my letters to the
directors of the company.  I have also given you a letter of acknowledgment of
your responsibilities
as directors.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:	We are not in receivership".</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:	The receivership appointments have occurred and this should be
recognised.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:	Peter Hardy and Hassals have sent a proposal to the bank in
relation to the sale of properties and repayment of the debt.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:	Yes the bank sent it to me last night and have asked me to look
at it.  The bank has not rejected it but wants me to
review it before they give
you a decision.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:	This matter is in limbo as the proposal has been submitted and I
have not received a response.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:	Rick you should take your own legal advice on the
matter.'</i>
<P>

319	Following Mr Wright having left the room to do so, Mr McCarthy or Mr
Skinner said:  
<P>

	<i>`Rick, the proposal from Hassals does not give any backup assumptions and
it is very difficult to read as it has been faxed.</i>
<P>

<i>	Ms Wright:	I will ring Hassals and have them provide the backup information
today.'</i>
<P>

320	I do not see that any issue in the case turns on the above described
conversation or on the other conversations which are set
out immediately
following this paragraph.  In short, it is ultimately unnecessary to decide
between the differing versions of the
conversations.
<P>

321	On the same limited basis as previous referred to, a conversation which
took place between Mr Wright, Mr McCarthy and Mr Skinner
early in April was
deposed to by Mr Wright.  In this conversation Mr Wright had said:  
<P>

	<i>"I want to make it very clear to you about the genetics that have been
developed on Jeogla over the last 100 or more years.  The key
to the business
and the genetic value of this herd is the core breeding herd.  The core
breeding herd as a genetic pool is not only
a very valuable asset for Jeogla
but is important to Australia.  There are very few such breeding herds or such
genetic pools in
Australia and we should do whatever we can to preserve those
that do exist."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr McCarthy:  "As far as we are concerned the cattle are worth 67cents a
kilo.  That's the going price for meat and as far as we
are concerned your
cattle are no different."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:  "I've told you before, we have been told by the Bank to get
their money in and we intend to do that by whatever means
we have to.  We are
under the Bank's instructions, if it means selling what you regard as a
valuable herd, so be it."</i>
<P>

322	Mr McCarthy accepted that he recalled Mr Wright saying words to the above
general effect.  He denied, however, that he or Mr
Skinner had said words to
the effect attributed to them by Mr Wright.
<P>

323	Mr Wright first learned that Hernani had been sold for delivery on 1 August
at a price of $1.1million on or about 29 April 1998.
 He had a conversation
with Mr Skinner and Mr McCarthy at that time.  The conversation was admitted
only as proving that it took
place and not to prove the truth of facts stated
by either party to the conversation.  In the conversation, words to the
following
effect were said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Skinner:   "I am able to tell you that Hernani has been sold for
$1.1million with delivery to take place on 1 August.  The buyer
does not want
any cattle."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "I think that is a sale at gross under value . . . As I told
you in March, had it been marketed with Jeogla internationally
there would have
been a substantial price paid for both properties because of the way that they
work well together and because of
the combined overall carrying
capacity."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:  "We are under Bank instructions and none of that means
anything to me.  My instructions are to get the Bank's money
back as quickly as
possible . . .  Since the buyer does not want the cattle I will be disposing of
the cattle one way or another.
 I am under Bank instructions about this but
will act to get as much money for the cattle as quickly as I can."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "In relation to the cattle, you simply can't sell these cattle
as you would sell steers in a sale yard, breeding cows
are the factory for
producing the meat.  We haven't put 170 years of breeding into these cattle for
them to be sacrificed in this
way.  They cannot all be moved because they start
calving on 1 August and any movement of them now would probably be an offence
under
the animal welfare laws and would be sacrificial of their value.  A lot
of the cows would die.       . . ."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Skinner:  "I have said to you before and I will say again we are under
Bank instructions to recover their money as quickly as
we can irrespective of
any of these finer points that you keep raising </i>[a reference to so much of
the conversation as involved difficulties in moving pregnant cows and the
like]<i>."</i>
<P>

324	Mr McCarthy could not recall having a conversation with Mr Wright to the
above effect.  He did, however, deny that Mr Wright
at any time said to him
words to the effect:
<P>

	<i>`As I told you in March, had it been marketed with Jeogla internationally
there would have been a substantial price paid for both
properties because of
the way that they work well together and because of the combined overall
carrying capacity.'</i>
<P>

325	Mr Wright complained that at the auction of Hernani and subsequent sale, no
mention was made whatever of the status and qualification
of the property as
Cattle Care audited.
<P>

326	Mr Wright deposed that on 14 May 1998, whilst he attended an inspection of
Jeogla with Mr Watts, Mr Nolan, Mr McCarthy and Mr
Graham, a conversation took
place.  Evidence of the conversation was admitted into evidence as proving the
conversation having taken
place and not as proving the truth of the underlying
facts therein referred to.  In this conversation, words to the following effect
were, inter alia, said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Wright - pointing to some cattle:  "How would you value these
cattle?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:  "We are experts in land and that includes being experts in
cattle." . .</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Mr Wright, pointing to some Jersey cross-calves -<i> "I'd like you to
look at those cattle over there.  What do you think they are worth".</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:  "I think they would be worth $40 a head at the moment."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "Well I can tell you that as recently as last week I sold that
group of cattle over there for $160 a head because of
what can be done with
genetics."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "What do you know about quality assurance in the beef
industry?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:   "Nothing."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "Do you know the consequences of having quality assurance
particularly when it comes to marketing?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Nolan:  "No, would you explain to me what you are talking about."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "This is the first property in Australia that is gearing itself
to market its product globally.  That includes live cattle,
beef, wool, live
sheep and mutton.  Also the office procedures are second to none when it comes
to running this sort of business.
 These procedures are included in the ISO
specifications.  Without a detailed knowledge of those matters I don't know how
you could
imagine you could market the property.  These matters make
international marketing essential if any proper value is to be
obtained."</i>
<P>

327	Mr McCarthy gave evidence that he was present when Mr David Nolan from LJ
Hooker Rural, inspected the property and that Mr Wright
may have said the words
attributed to him in the above excerpt from Mr Wright's affidavit, either on
that day or upon other occasions.
 He did not recall Mr Nolan's responses but
denied that Mr Nolan had said the words which Mr Wright attributed to him.
<P>

328	Mr Wright gave evidence that he did not believe that a reasonable price was
obtained for Jeogla Station for the following main
reasons:
<P>

	(a)	Jeogla Station he said, was a pre-eminent and famous cattle property and
was probably in the top 100 rural properties along
the eastern seaboard of
Australia.  It produces cattle.  On an average year, he said, the gross income
received from the sale of
cattle on Jeogla Station was about $1.5million.  His
evidence was that the annual expenses for Jeogla Station were about $500,000
which would include an allowance of about $150,000 for interest on a loan and
this would leave about $1million in net income before
tax.
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	The high quality and well known brand V1B Hereford Beefmaker was
not marketed.
<P>

329	Mr Wright also gave evidence in relation to the 22 May 1998 production sale
of cattle at Jeogla Station.  His evidence which
I accept as reliable, was that
the cattle sold at that sale were `culled' cattle, meaning that the cattle were
surplus to the Jeogla
Station herd and were cattle culled from the herd because
the quality of the cattle sold were not as good a quality as the cattle
remaining in the Jeogla Station herd.  His evidence was that many of the cattle
sold were aged or old cows.  Such production sales,
which usually occurred at
Jeogla Station in about March-May each year before winter, were to get rid of
the cattle in the herd that
were aged or of lesser quality to the rest of the
herd.  Such a sale was carried out so that the worst quality cattle were culled
and the Jeogla Station herd maintain its high quality.
<P>

330	Mr Wright's further evidence which is accepted as reliable, was that the
cattle on Hernani were sold under the V1V brand and
were no different from the
cattle on Jeogla Station in quality.  Hernani was, he said, used as a satellite
property to Jeogla Station.
 The cattle on Hernani were sold in the V1V Jeogla
sale.  They were all, he said "Jeogla cattle".  Depending upon the
circumstances,
his evidence was that cattle on Hernani were moved to Jeogla
Station or vice versa.
<P>

331	Mr Wright's evidence which is accepted as reliable was that on or about 30
May 1998 he had arranged for Mr Crowe to value a
sample of the stock on Jeogla
Station as at 30 May 1998 for immediate sale with no time to market them or
condition them.  His evidence
was that on or about 18 August, Armitage and
Buckley, Licensed Auctioneers, Stock and Station Agents and Real Estate Agents
of Armidale,
valued the stock then on Hernani and RBA12 to his affidavit was a
copy of that valuation.
<P>

332	Mr Wright deposed in paragraph 59 of his affidavit that on 5 June 1998, he
had a conversation with Mr McCarthy at the sale barn
at Jeogla Station.   The
paragraph was admitted as proving only the conversation as having taken place.
The conversation, Mr Wright
said, had involved words to the following
effect:
<P>

	<i>Mr Wright:  "I would like to talk to the new owner of Hernani about
agistment.  What is his name?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr McCarthy:  "Warren Della [sic] and he is in Italy at the moment."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "Delivery date on Hernani is still August 1st is it?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr McCarthy:  "Yes, and we're going to sell him the cattle at 77c per
kilogram.  That is a better result than you got in your Sale
Barn."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:  "But the cattle we sold in the Barn were cull cattle.  You are
proposing to sell sound breeding cattle at 77c per kilogram.
 This would be a
sacrifice of them."</i>
<P>

333	Mr Wright's evidence was that, on or about 29 June 1998, the cattle at
Hernani were sold by the bank and Mr Skinner at 77cents
per kilogram, achieving
then a total sale price of about $177,000.  As far as he was aware, there was
no attempt made to sell them
otherwise than to the purchaser of Hernani.  They
were, he said, not sold by a competitive process to the market and his evidence
was that they were not sold for market price.
<P>

334	Mr Wright's evidence which is accepted was that, since the cattle at
Hernani were sold in about June 1998, cattle prices had
increased.  He
estimated that the meat price for cattle had increased by about 50cents per
kilo and estimated that the value of an
average good quality V1V Hereford
Beefmaker breeding cow with a calf at foot was as at December 1998, about $750.
His evidence was
that there was an extreme shortage of good quality breeding
cows.
<P>

335	Mr Wright's evidence was that he understood the livestock on Jeogla Station
and the plant and equipment were sold by the bank
and receiver to the Jeogla
Station purchaser and that as far as he was aware, there was not attempt
otherwise to sell or market that
livestock and property.
<P>

336	Mr Wright's evidence was:
<P>

	<i>`The cattle sold at Jeogla Station and Hernani were sold without taking
into account the top quality of V1V Hereford Beefmaker cattle.
 These cattle
are more fertile and produce higher quality meat than average cattle.  Jeogla
Station together with Hernani and their
V1V Hereford Beefmaker Cattle is
recognised as one of the leading beef cattle operations in Eastern Australia.'
</i>[Affidavit paragraph 64]
<P>

337	Mr Wright's evidence was that, in relation to the completion of the Jeogla
Station cattle which he believed took place on about
23 November 1998, that as
at that date there would have been about 7,000 stock.  This figure of 7,000 he
said "includes Spring calves
of about 1500 which were born in a nine-week
period commencing July 1 to about September 7.  If the figure of about
$1,671,000 for
the Jeogla Station livestock includes all these cattle, this
makes the value obtained for the livestock on Jeogla Station lower".
<P>

338	Mr Wright's evidence was that, as far as he was aware, there was no attempt
to sell the Jeogla Station or the Hernani cattle
by any competitive process to
the market.
<P>

339	Mr Wright's evidence was that, in his opinion, the cattle at Hernani and
Jeogla Station were sold in the wrong manner and at
the wrong time.  As far as
he was aware, there was no marketing or advertising of the sale of the cattle
at Hernani or Jeogla Station.
 He believed the cattle should have been sold
through the Jeogla Station sale barn and the CALM process.  In his opinion, the
stock
should have been sold when they looked their best which is when the
cattle had improved their condition after winter and had the
benefits of
fattening in the spring season - the time they should have been sold, he said,
was November 1998.
<P>

340	Mr Wright gave evidence which is accepted, that in his opinion Jeogla
Station and Hernani were in drought during 1997 and into
1998 and that there
had been good rains in about April - June which indicated a likelihood of a
good spring.  However, when the rains
had come this occurred in Winter and
Winter at Jeogla Station and Hernani was very severe.  The properties, he said,
had started
to recover in Spring 1998 and were in a very good condition from
about the middle of October 1998 to about December 1998.
<P>

341	Mr Wright's evidence was that no one from the bank or Mr Skinner's office
or Mr Skinner had formally notified him of the sale
of Hernani, Jeogla Station,
the livestock or the Jeogla Station plant and equipment.  He had had to obtain
what information he had
from conversations, scattered correspondence, annexures
to affidavits and the like.
<P>

342	In a second statement, dated 22 February 1999, Mr Wright had referred to a
number of particular documents which were, in due
course tendered.  These
related to a sale on 5 February 1999 by the new owners of Jeogla Station of
cattle at Jeogla Station.  That
sale was the bi-annual steer sale which
normally would occur in about October/November of each year but in relation
which the sale
had been postponed from November 1998 to February 1999 due to
the change in ownership.
<P>

343	He had not in fact attended the sale.  Annexed to his affidavit was a copy
of the buyer action sheet, summarising the sales
of the cattle at auction.  He
noted that approximately 1200 weaners and steers aged between 10 months and 16
months had been sold
at the auction sale, those being merely the progeny of the
core V1V Hereford Beefmaker breeding herd at Jeogla Station.  His evidence
was
that the value of that progeny was less than the core breeding herd.  The range
of sales for the progeny was 110-138 cents per
kilogram for the Beefmaker
heifer calves and up to a price of 149 cents per kilogram for the weaner steer
calves.
<P>

344	By comparison, he was aware that the core breeding herd of Hernani Station
was sold privately by the receiver for the average
price of 77 cents per
kilogram.  His evidence was that the Hernani stock of V1V Hereford cattle
breeders and the same quality as
the Jeogla Station cattle.
<P>

345	Generally, Mr Wright's statement of 22 February 1999 was one in which he
gave evidence which is accepted, that the results of
the 5 February 1999
auction sale at the Jeogla Station sale barn on site showed the ease at which
the Jeogla breeding herd and the
Hernani breeding herd could have been sold by
well publicised auction dispersal sales.  The results of the 5 February 1999
auction
sale, he said, showed that of the 39 sale lots at the auction sale, 24
lots were sold by the CALM interface system to people bidding
by computer at
Goulburn, Upper Hunter, Merriwa and Barraba and not physically present at the
auction.

	<b>Mr R.J. Gardiner</b>
<P>

346	 Mr Gardiner is a certified practising Valuer and registered valuer and a
director of Herron Todd White, Valuers.  He prepared
a valuation dated 5 August
1998 of Jeogla and Bald Hills, earlier referred to.  He had also, on 7 August
1998, written to the receiver
in terms earlier referred to in this Judgment.
He had responded to an affidavit originally made by Mr T.J. Stewart on 17 June
1998
and to a valuation report annexed to that affidavit dated 9 June 1998, but
Mr Stewart's affidavit was not read by the plaintiffs.
<P>

	<b>Mr R.D. Fitzgerald</b>
<P>

347	Mr Fitzgerald is an Agricultural Consultant who had prepared a report to
assist with Mr Gardiner in the valuation of Jeogla
Station and Bald Hills.  The
report is to be found at PX 1069.  It dealt with the long term carrying
capacity and value of Jeogla
Station.  It is unnecessary to deal with the
detail of the report, save to make plain that the carrying capacity section
appears
at PX 1078 and deals with the dry sheep equivalent carrying capacity on
different bases.  Mr Fitzgerald also had dealt with a response
to the affidavit
of Mr T.J. Stewart which had not ultimately been read in the proceedings.
<P>

	<b>Mr David McCarthy</b>
<P>

348	Mr McCarthy, who is employed by Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group and is
a Chartered Accountant, had assisted the receiver
in the receivership of
Jeogla, prior to 4 January 1999.  His evidence comprised dealing with
paragraphs 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40 and
41 to Mr Wright's statement dated 10
December 1998.  Where Mr Wright's statement has been referred to earlier, Mr
McCarthy's relevant
responses have already been set out.
<P>

349	Mr McCarthy also dealt with sections of Mr Graham's affidavit.  Likewise,
in relation to these sections where Mr Graham's evidence
was given, Mr
McCarthy's response is set out.
<P>

350	Mr McCarthy also deposed that in about November 1997 he spoke with Mr
Wright, when Mr Wright had said to him words to the effect:
 `When Hernani was
auctioned in November it was passed in at $1.25million.  We are considering
appointing a new agent Frank Spilsbury
from Elders, Armidale.  He is the only
agent in the area who understands rural properties.'
<P>

351	Mr McCarthy also deposed that on or about 18 December 1997, he telephoned
Mr John Hutchinson, a partner in Hutchinson and Harlow,
Real Estate Agents and
Insurance Brokers, known to him as having acted as Jeogla Group's insurance
broker.  In that conversation,
Mr McCarthy had said:  "My name is David
McCarthy, I am a manager with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.  Keith Skinner, who is
a partner
of the firm, is receiver and manager of Hernani Station, a property
owned by the Wright family.  I have had numerous conversations
with your
partner, John Harlow, in relation to the insurance matters of the Jeogla Group
and he has referred me to you for your opinion
on your preferred choice of
rural real estate agents in this area, specifically to market Hernani Station .
. ."  Mr McCarthy deposed
that Mr Hutchinson had stated that Frank Spilsbury of
Elders had a very good rural background and would be his preferred choice ahead
of any other rural agents in the area.
<P>

	<b>Mr John Collier</b>
<P>

352	Mr Collier had sworn an affidavit on 1 April 1999.  He is a director of
Raine &amp; Horne Rural Northern New South Wales which
operates as a
professional rural marketing agency and he specialises in rural property
marketing.  He dealt generally with Mr Peart's
affidavit.  He disagreed with a
deal of Mr Peart's recommendations with respect to the specifics for marketing
and advertising material
to be used for auction.  In his view, to allow the
property to be advertised for a period of four months would be too long and
would
result in the market perceiving the vendor as being weak and
substantially increase the marketing costs to no benefit to the vendor.
 In his
view, a marketing period of around six to eight weeks from publication of the
first advertisement was sufficient.
<P>

353	He had reviewed the information memorandum prepared by LJ Hooker Rural for
Jeogla which was supplied to potential purchasers.
 He found it particularly
thorough and extensive, containing all relevant information of:
<P>

	-  the property description;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  accurate livestock numbers;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  information on the National Cattle Care Programme;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  the improvements throughout the property;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  ongoing management in relation to Mr Braham and information
regarding his skills and experience;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  rainfall records;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  information from the Rural Lands Protection Board for the V1V
brand;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  the thorough valuations by Mr Knock of Rushtons;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  the topography maps, aerial photos, paddock, water and structural
improvements maps;
<P>

<i>	</i>-  as well as the general information not the Armidale District
[sic].
<P>

354	In his view, no stone had been left unturned in the presentation.
<P>

355	He considered the advertising material put together by Mr Nolan to be very
professional and thorough in terms of quality and
content.
<P>

356	He generally dealt only with materials covered in Mr Peart's affidavit and
his affidavit evidence did not go to questions such
as dispersal sales and
premiums.  Nor did his affidavit deal with the question of the significance of
prior advertising publication
and promotion on the basis of specific
information as to a right of first refusal to purchase the cattle at a
pre-determined and
announced price.  He was not cross-examined on his
affidavit.
<P>

	<b>Michelle E. Harpur</b>
<P>

357	Ms Harpur is the solicitor for the defendant, having the day to day conduct
of the proceedings with Norton Smith &amp; Co. 
Her affidavit evidence dealt
with the prior history of the various sets of proceedings involving the
plaintiffs, the Bank and the
Receiver.  Her evidence was not challenged and
gives background history of the litigation.
<P>

	<b>Mr A.I. Armstrong</b>
<P>

358	Mr Armstrong is a partner of Norton Smith who acted for Jeogla Pty Limited
in its own capacity and as trustee for the Wright
Family Trust in the sale of
the property known as Hernani and Tiercel.  His affidavit dealt with his
preparation of the contract
for sale and issues concerning the occupation
permit granted by the Department of State Forests, adjoining the property, in
favour
of Jeogla Pty Limited and Mr &amp; Mrs Wright, trading as BA &amp; RB
Wright &amp; Partners.  The subject of the forestry permit
did not occupy any
real time during the hearing and no ultimate issues specifically was addressed
to that topic.
<P>

	<b>Mr C.R. Campbell</b>
<P>

359	Mr Campbell is a partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and a registered
liquidator.  Whilst the receiver was overseas on business
on leave from 14
September 1998 to 19 October 1998, Mr Campbell was responsible for the
receivership.  He had a number of conversations
with Mr Skinner prior to his
departure and received a briefing on matters arising out of the receivership.
On 11 September 1998,
he met with Mr Skinner and representatives of the Bank
and Mr Nolan in order to discuss the proposed auction.  Mr Nolan discussed
his
progress report of 10 September 1998 which detailed all enquiries he had
received in relation to the sale of Jeogla.
<P>

360	Mr Campbell was informed by Mr Skinner, amongst other things that:
<P>

	.	The Bank had obtained a valuation of Jeogla from Herron Todd White dated 5
August 1998 which valued the property at between $5.3
and $6.2million.
<P>

<i>	</i>.	The reserve price for the sale should be set in consultation with the
Bank and notified to the auctioneer immediately prior to the
auction.
<P>

<i>	</i>.	The purchaser should be offered first right of refusal for the
purchase of the livestock, plant and equipment in accordance with
the terms of
the draft contract.
<P>

<i>	</i>.	The price as specified in schedule 1 to the draft contract for the
sale of livestock, included a premium above the market appraisal
conducted by
Elders.
<P>

361	On 18 September 1998, Mr Campbell again met with representatives of the
Bank and Mr Nolan to discuss the parties who may be
interested in purchasing
Jeogla.  Mr Nolan discussed his progress report dated 18 September 1998.  After
Mr Nolan had left the meeting,
Mr Campbell also discussed the setting of the
reserve price with the representatives of the Bank which included Mr Soper.
They agreed
that the reserve price would be set on 21 September 1998 and that
Mr Campbell would notify Mr Nolan of the reserve price at the commencement
of
the auction by letter.
<P>

362	A conversation took place on 21 September 1998 between Mr Soper of the Bank
and Mr Campbell.  That conversation was admitted
as evidence only of the
conversation and not of the underlying facts.  In the conversation, Mr Campbell
had said that the range in
the valuation was between $5.3million and
$6.2million and Mr Soper had said that he thought the reserve should be set at
the high
end of the valuation at $6.2million even though it seemed unlikely
from their discussions with David Nolan that the price would ever
be reached.
Mr Campbell agreed with that.  He said that in setting the reserve price at
that level it had the advantage that Mr Nolan
and the auctioneer would be
required to refer the highest bids to the receivers prior to passing the
property in so that they could
make a decision on the day.
<P>

363	Detail of the auction was also included in Mr Campbell's affidavit.  His
evidence was that the highest bid for Jeogla at the
auction was $5.75million
and that although that bid was within the range of the valuation of the
property provided by Mr Gardiner,
after discussion with the Bank he instructed
Mr Nolan that the property should be passed in and that he would immediately
commence
negotiations with the highest bidder in an effort to increase the
offer.
<P>

364	Later, negotiations had taken place in the auction rooms of LJ Hooker with
representatives of the highest bidder at the auction
Peakhurst Properties Pty
Limited.  Most of the negotiations occurred through Mr Nolan.  In the course of
those negotiations, Mr Nolan
had said to Mr Campbell;   `The highest bidder is
Peakhurst Properties.  They had told me that they have exceeded their limit and
are not going to increase their offer.  In fact they are considering reducing
their offer from $5.7million'.  Mr Campbell had responded
that the receiver
would not accept any reduced offer but that the buyer would have to come up and
subsequently Mr Nolan had said
to Mr Campbell:  `I've tried to get them to
increase their price.  They will not.  They have now said that they want to
reconsider
their offer and want to call this off for the moment.  They are
going to ring you later in the day to negotiate further'.
<P>

365	Mr Campbell said that negotiations terminated at approximately 1pm that
day.
<P>

366	Mr Campbell's evidence was that later on the same day, he received a
telephone call from the representative of Peakhurst Properties
who indicated
that negotiations were to continue at their request.  Negotiations then resumed
at about 2:30pm on the afternoon. 
At the commencement of those negotiations,
Peakhurst Properties' representatives said that the offer made at the auction
was formally
withdrawn and they wished to make a new offer.  Mr Campbell could
not recall the exact amount of the offer but did recall that it
contemplated a
delayed settlement of over twelve months and that the affect of the offer was
that it was about $300,000 less than
their highest bid at the auction.  He
rejected that offer.
<P>

367	Mr Campbell's evidence was that after further negotiations throughout the
afternoon, Peakhurst Properties offered to pay the
original bid price of
$5.75million.  His evidence was:  `As there was no other party who had
expressed an interest before or after
the auction in purchasing Jeogla for a
price close to this amount, I formed the view that this was the market price
and the best
price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances and accepted the
offer'.
<P>

368	Mr Campbell's evidence was that Peakhurst Properties `had indicated that it
wished to purchase the livestock and plant and equipment,
and we then commenced
negotiations for the sale of these assets.  Various offers were made on behalf
of Peakhurst Properties which
were below the valuation.  Following further
negotiations, Peakhurst Properties increased its offer to the purchase price as
specified
in the respective contracts for sale . . . In the case of the
livestock, the offer and eventual purchase price included a premium
above the
value specified by Elders in their appraisal . . . and was therefore above
market price'.  He decided to accept the offer.
 It was his belief that the
offer was `better than could be achieved if the cattle were sold by auction
taking into account the delay
and costs involved'.  In the case of plant and
equipment, the offer was only slightly less than the valuation and his belief
was
that in his view, more than would be realised had it been necessary to
auction the plant and equipment in a clearing sale.  He also
accepted that
offer.
<P>

369	Mr Campbell also dealt with paragraphs 23 and 24 of the Graham affidavit.
Where those matters are referred to, the effect of
Mr Campbell's evidence is
set out against Mr Graham's evidence earlier in this Judgment.
<P>

370	After receiving a facsimile from M &amp; A McEvoy Development Group of 23
September 1998 Mr Campbell had responded on 25 September
1998 confirming that
contracts had been exchanged.
<P>

	<b>Mr A.R. Madigan </b>
<P>

371	Evidence was given by Mr Madigan, who is a Licensed Stock and Station
Agent, Licensed Real Estate Agent and Licensed Business
Agent and is the Branch
Manager of Elders Limited in Armidale. He has been in the employ of Elders for
fourteen years, being formerly
employed by Dalgetys Limited for six years.  The
question of the reliability of Mr Madigan's evidence is dealt with later in the
Judgment.
<P>

372	Mr Madigan holds accreditation with CALM as a Professional Livestock
Assessor Level 1 (Cattle), and as a National Livestock
Assessor (Cattle). In
order to maintain CALM accreditation, he is required to assess a minimum of 20
lots of cattle, of varying head,
per year. Mr Madigan deposed that assessment
of livestock involves the physical inspection of the stock to determine age,
type, breed,
weight and fat and muscle measurement. This determines what
markets the stock is sold to. 
<P>

373	Mr Madigan has been an Auctioneer for 20 years. He is the Auctioneer for
Elders at the cattle and sheep sales at the Armidale
stockyards which, for the
last 3 years, have been held every Thursday. Mr Madigan deposed that he, at the
request of Mr Wright, has
represented Elders in the cattle auction sales on
Jeogla Station for the last 3 years. His involvement has either been in his
capacity
as Assessor, or as Auctioneer, or both.
<P>

374	Mr Madigan deposed that in March 1998, he was instructed by Mr Skinner to
estimate the market price at that time of stock located
on Hernani and Tiercel.
He provided this estimation on 19 March 1998, on the basis of the age and class
listing of livestock provided
by Mr Skinner and his own knowledge of the market
and the prices achieved at the 19 March 1998 Armidale cattle sale.
Subsequently,
in April 1998, Mr Skinner instructed Mr Madigan to inspect and
value the Hernani and Tiercel cattle. Mr Madigan deposed that he inspected
the
cattle on 1 May 1998 and provided an estimation as to price as at 7 May 1998 to
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on 8 May 1998. His estimation,
of 75c per kilogram,
was based on his own knowledge of the market and the prices achieved at the 7
May 1998 Armidale cattle sale.
<P>

375	Mr Madigan deposed that at the time he undertook the 7 May 1998 valuation,
he was aware that Mr Skinner had received an offer
from the purchaser of
Hernani and Tiercel, Mr W Dellow, to purchase the livestock at the price of 77c
per kilogram. His evidence
was:
<P>

	<i>`...in order to assess Mr Dellow's offer, I prepared a document comparing
the price offered by Mr Dellow with my estimate of price
provided to the Second
Defendant dated 7 May 1998. .. As an average price per kilogram, Mr Dellow's
offer represented an increase
of 2c per kilogram above my estimate. In
addition, the offer made by Mr Dellow was on a "as is where" basis. If the
Second Defendant
had sold the cattle at Auction at Armidale sale yards or
Jeogla Station, the Second Defendant would have incurred significant costs
of
transporting the cattle, travel insurance and costs relating to the sale,
commission and yard dues. Taking into account these
costs, I formed the view
that the offer by Mr Dellow represented a price per kilo at Auction of 85c. In
addition, the Second Defendant
would also have been required to pay advertising
costs. The costs for advertising stock for an Auction is between $4 to $5 per
head.</i>
<P>

<i>	The sale of the stock to Mr Dellow also avoided potential problems
concerning the welfare of the stock. .. The movement of pregnant
cows can cause
birth difficulties and transit tetany. Further, if the cows have calved,
mismothering can occur when transporting
them to sale yards...</i>' [Affidavit
30 March 1999, para 7]
<P>

376	Mr Madigan, on instruction from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, inspected the
Jeogla livestock on 30 July 1998 for the purpose of
providing a market
appraisal. His evidence was that his appraisal of the value of the cattle as at
30 July 1998 was based on his
knowledge of the markets, the VIV brand and the
breeding and the prices achieved at the livestock sale at Armidale on 23 July
1998.

<P>

377	In a letter sent to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on 27 August 1998, Mr Madigan
noted the variance in price between his appraisal
of the Hernani cattle in
March and May 1998 and his appraisal of the Jeogla cattle in August 1998.  He
explained the price variance
as based on a number of factors:
<P>

	<i>`1.	The Hernani (spring) cows were due to calve in August, and the Jeogla
(spring) cows are calving now and have calves at foot.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	The Hernani (autumn) cows were starting to calve when inspected in March
and the Jeogla (autumn) cows have marked and branded
calves at foot as at 30
July 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	The Hernani steer and heifer calves were weaned in Feb, approximately
one month prior to the appraisal. The Jeogla steer and heifer
calves were also
weaned in Feb, approximately 6 months prior to the appraisal.</i>
<P>

<i>	A lot of the variance is due to market fluctuations (in upward trend) since
March 1998. Also, growth of cattle, mainly of calves,
due to time (age) and an
improved season.'</i>
<P>

378	Mr Madigan, with reference to paragraph 50 of the statement of Mr Wright,
dated 10 December 1998, deposed that during the time
he had been involved in
the production sales on Jeogla, he had observed that prior to the sales, the
cattle were drafted into three
categories - "tops' "seconds" and "culls". The
"tops" are the best cattle and were retained in the herd on Jeogla. The
"seconds"
were cattle that were either sold in the sale or sold direct to
butchers. The "culled" cattle were either not of sufficient quality
to be sold
in the production sale and were kept to fatten or sold directly to butchers, or
were culled due to pregnancy status (ie,
they were not pregnant) or age.
<P>

379	Mr Madigan deposed that the cattle on Hernani were not as well grown, and
were of lesser quality and weight for age than the
cattle on Jeogla. He
attributed this difference to difference in the vegetation and feed on both
properties.
<P>

380	Mr Madigan gave evidence in chief as to the basis on which he valued the
cattle on Jeogla Station as at 30 July 1998. His evidence
was that in the
appraisal of the 160 cows on the Diamonds paddock, those cows having dropped
their calves in the autumn, a cow with
calf was treated as one unit. When asked
whether it was appropriate to value a cow with calf as one unit, in view of a
late September
sale, Mr Madigan answered that it would depend on when the
calves were to be weaned.
<P>

	<i>`Q.	All right.  Well, if you assume that the calves were going to be weaned
by 22 September, or perhaps later in the year in October,
would one look at it
a little bit differently?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	You could look at it in - as a cow and calf unit.  We would put a value
on the cow and then a value on the calf separately, or
you could still put it
as one unit giving an estimate of the growth of the calf or what it would
be.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you have discussions with any one particular person at Mr Skinner's
office in the course of working out your figures?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	David McCarthy. . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you discuss with Mr McCarthy the topic of splitting the calf from
the cow, looking ahead some period later in the year when
the calf and cow unit
may be sold?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, we did have discussions, yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Just generally the welfare of the cow and calf unit, cause if the cow -
if the calf was split too early as to how would it grow
out.  If it was split
in the normal course of events, and allowing the season was going with it,
would it grow on properly, and along
those lines mainly.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T262-263]
<P>

381	Mr Madigan gave evidence that while the cattle market fluctuated between 30
July 1998 and 22 September 1998, there was generally
an increase of about 5% in
cattle prices overall.
<P>

382	Mr Madigan was asked to consider the value of the cow, formerly of the cow
and calf unit, after the calf had been weaned from
the cow:
<P>

	<i>Q.	`. . . now, would you assume for the moment that Mr Crowe put a
valuation on these cows in May of 1998 at $600, and would you also
assume that
the cows had calves and those calves were then valued at $250 as an average
price.  In your view, Mr Madigan, would it
be appropriate after one had looked
at the cow which dropped its calf and the calf had been weaned, to treat the
cow ex-calf at the
same value as had been fixed in May of 1998?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No . . . the cow and calf unit is one value and to take the calf off it
lessens the value of - well, it brings the value back
to one cow.'</i>
<P>

383	In cross-examination, Mr Madigan conceded that cows that were on the autumn
cattle in May and July, being notionally weaned
and included in the 1380 count
of mixed Beefmaker weaners on the submission Document 1 Spreadsheet, were by 12
November, for example,
no longer simply a solitary cow but a spring cow with
calf at foot. He gave evidence that as the spring cows are now two animals
instead of one, any premium for there being two animals which is expressed as
being attached to the autumn cows, would attach to
the spring cows. He gave
evidence as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	So unless you had, in effect, a production sale or whatever between the
July cut-off and your situation in this document, the
number of animals on the
ground is the 1380 calves which were previously embedded in the autumn cattle
numbers, plus all the cattle,
plus all the cows, plus the calves that have now
issued from the spring drop cows?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So that is this right? To, in effect, make a complete reconciliation
between the schedule as it was reworked to allow for projecting
forward to
September, October, in the exercise that you were speaking of to my learned
friend, one moves any premium for cattle off
the autumn cattle and puts them on
to the spring cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Generally, yes, yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And there isn't any double counting involved because unless you have
sold out the 1380 calves weaners from autumn cows referred
to in this schedule,
the aggregate size of the herd is increased by the new calve drop, hasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	yes.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 264]
<P>

384	Mr Madigan then gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	When you did the appraisal you did it on the basis of cows with calf at
foot?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In relation to the autumn cows?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	At some later point in time you were asked to consider whether, as a
matter of husbandry, those calves in fact would be considered
to be separate
animals for the purpose of the sale and valuation;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you expressed the view that yes they would as to 1380 odd calves and
that they would have a value of about $180 come September,
October of 1998;  is
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would have given a range, not an actual price.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you remember at this point in time what that range was?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I don't.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Apart from the effect of splitting out the value of the calf from the
cow and calf combination, were you asked after July to readdress
the question
of the value of the cow itself?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So that is this right?  In the discussions you had with the receiver's
office after July your view as to the appropriate dollar
value of the cow
component remained constant.  The principal variable was to recognise the
weaners as a separate beast and to give
a range of values for those
heifers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, in discussions in the receiver's office with Mr McCarthy, we
discussed - the principal discussion was about the calf because
the calf is
naturally growing being on its mother and going along quite well.  We also
discussed that the calf gets bigger, the cow
generally loses condition if the
season is not with her.  If the season is with her sometimes the cow will go
along just as well
as the calf can do a good job.  The season, however, at that
time however wasn't with them and as the calves get bigger the good
cows will
put the condition into their calves, rather than into themselves, so the cows
condition would be coming back.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So the cows weight might be coming back?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And sold for its meat.  Its value would be diminishing;  is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But as a breeding animal it's doing precisely its job very
efficiently?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Very efficiently, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It is acting, in effect, as a food store, food bank for the purposes of
putting condition on the calf at the expense of its own
condition?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So that animals capable of doing that and do that consistently, I take
it, are valuable elements in a breeding herd, particularly
where feed or fodder
supply is variable through the seasons?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In my opinion, if you haven't got a cow that doesn't do if you haven't
got a breeding herd.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Quite.  So I take it your observation that the cows were losing
condition was not a matter meant to reflect on their value, was
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, it does, it reflects on their value, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If they're sold as meat it reflects on their value?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	As to restockers, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	To a restocker, buying a cow with a calf at foot midway through a bad
season and the cow is still supplying condition to its calf,
that would be a
cow and a calf doing precisely what a restocker or anyone else would expect a
cow and calf to do, wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's what they expect, yes.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T265-266]
<P>

385	Mr Madigan, on being asked whether a cow having a calf at foot may be
pregnant, answered yes, and further acknowledged that
the cows on Jeogla
Station were fairly unique in the breeding embedded in the breeding herd. Mr
Madigan could not say whether, after
his appraisal of 30 July, he was asked
whether the cows anticipated not to have a calf at foot in November were worth
the same amount,
or more or less than the appraisal value. 
<P>

386	Mr Madigan was then asked a number of questions in relation to the cattle
markets to which he had reference when conducting
his appraisal of the Hernani
and Jeogla cattle. He evidence was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Now, you have said in your statement in various places in dealing with
the appraisal of cattle, that you have employed for the
purposes of performing
your appraisal, the reports from the livestock market detailed cattle report
for the Armidale sale yards from
time to time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you confine yourself to Armidale as to the records which you
examined for the purposes of expressing your appraisals?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I see.  What other sales did you look at, apart from Armidale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Store sales in the district;  also previous Jeogla sales.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The store sales records, where do we find those in your
affidavit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	You don't.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Where do we find reference to you having used them in your
affidavit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	My knowledge of the markets I think is the wording.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you say "the cattle market", I take it you mean what store cattle
sales, specialty sales, fat cattle sales, all over, what,
the east coast of
Australia?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Into Western Australia and South Australia as well?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not mainly, no, eastern States.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I see.  You kept, I take it, some record and note of the important
information from those observations to assist you, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you see the only document that you've referred to as providing your
guide is the record of the fat cattle sale in Armidale
on the Tuesday - on a
Thursday?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	As a guide, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>You would agree with me, would you not, that you may have
markedly different prices applying in fat cattle sales from those applying
in
well bred store cattle sales of commercial herds, might you not?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>It would be an important matter for you to consider in fixing
the appraised value of a beast as to determine, first of all, into what
market
it might most advantageously be sold?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes.</cite><i>'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T268-269]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

387	Mr Madigan then gave evidence that as he understood the situation in 1998,
offering the core Jeogla breeding herd was unique
in the annals of cattle
selling in his experience. This was because what had previously been sold off
Jeogla had been the culls and
the animals which had reached retirement age as
part of the breeding herd albeit still fertile and able to reproduce. He
anticipated
that, with the prospect of selling the Jeogla herd or substantial
parts of it, breeders could buy significant numbers of the Beefmaker
herd in
one go to add to a breeding herd or to start a new breeding herd. He agreed
that in his experience, it was the sort of sale
which, in the ordinary course
of things would be treated as a unique marketing opportunity for the buyer and
a unique selling circumstance
for the seller. 
<P>

388	Mr Madigan gave evidence that in the case of a large scale commercial store
market, it is commonplace for breeders of particular
cattle to travel
substantial distances to obtain significant numbers or qualities of offerings
of the herd they are interested in.
<P>

389	Mr Madigan was questioned in cross-examination as to the uplift or premium
he attached to the breeding herd above the general
price for cattle. During the
course of that questioning, he gave the following evidence on the relationship
between the breeding
herd and the production herd:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Madigan, in forming the view that you did about the cattle on
Hernani or the cattle on Jeogla what allowance did you make over
what you
considered to be the general price for cattle, for the fact that they were the
breeding herd of beefmaker cattle?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I took a base price from what the meat value was and then factored in
pregnancy status, the reputation of the herd and the condition
of the
cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Thank you.  Could you please tell us </i><cite>what was the amount of
the uplift that you used, if it indeed were an uplift, over the meat value for
the Hernani breeding herd?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>I didn't have a specific figure I worked on,
no</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Are you capable of calculating it or estimating it in relation to any
one of the lines of cattle that you appraised?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Based on what was sold in May at Jeogla, in the production sales and
then adding on to that as to what I think the market would
have paid at that
time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	For the production herd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, for the balance of the herd.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You see, you've said in your affidavit that you took the production
cattle sale as being reasonably representative of the herd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's right.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And was being sold in that sale was not the prime breeding cows of the
herd, was it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	They had been.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In what respect did you form the view that the core breeding herd
between one and eight-years-old was being offered for sale in
the production
sale?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Cattle that were kept from weaning at 10 months where Jeogla sold their
10-month-old cattle, the ones they wanted to keep in their
breeding herds
stayed on and they were the ones that were sold as 10 month old cattle in the
production sale that didn't either come
to a pregnancy or didn't fill out as
they wanted them to.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Yes.  These were the reject cattle from the breeding herd
because they were not suitable for breeding because they hadn't become pregnant
or they weren't performing to the standards of the herd;  is that
right?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>That's the ones in the production sale, yes.</cite><i>   . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	None of the cattle that were being offered for sale were the cattle that
were representative by way of age or breeding status
of the cattle that were
being retained on Jeogla as the core breeding herd, were they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, they were.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The cattle that were being offered were the ones that were too old to be
able to stay in the herd or the ones that were rejected
for inclusion in the
herd;  that's right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You would expect in a sale of animals out of the core breeding herd of
cows less than eight-years-old that have been selected
for breeding and kept
for breeding on Jeogla, that they would enjoy substantially higher prices than
the prices obtained at the production
sale, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Higher prices - not substantially;  not necessarily.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You would expect them to obtain substantially higher prices, wouldn't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	With the greatest of respect, Mr Madigan, you had young animals, you had
older animals that had been rejected as being infertile
or not being of the
appropriate standard for the breeding herd, and you had the old cows that had
reached their used-by date, hadn't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You did not have included in that sale the prime consistent breeders
that were retained as the core breeding herd of Jeogla, did
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Which examples of cows out of the core breeding herd of Jeogla do you
have in mind in giving that answer?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The cows based on a - the eight-year-old cows were part of the Jeogla
herd and, as I say, they were representative of the herd
that had stayed there,
up until their age, and that's when they were finished with.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In what way are the eight-year-old cows representative of the current
breeding herd?  Can you help us with that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	They have been there for eight years and gone through the selection
criteria, so they are very representative of the type of cattle
that were there
on Jeogla.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T275-278]
<P>

390	Mr Madigan gave the following evidence with reference to the premium:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	What increase or what margin over the meat value of Jeogla cattle, from
the breeding herd on Jeogla, would you expect in their
value simply sold in the
Thursday meat market in Armidale, if they were sold as store cattle for a
commercial herd?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The distance between fat and store?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, for those Jeogla cattle.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	At the time I think that the store market was starting to beat in some
places the butchers and in other parts the butchers were
beating the store
market.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can I suggest to you this, that in 1998 your expectation was that Jeogla
cattle properly marketed in relation to their value as
commercial breeding
animals was that they would be worth between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of
their value simply sold as meat
on a live weight basis;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Increase of 50 per cent?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	To 100 per cent;  in other words, with the sale of a Jeogla breeding cow
would you expect to achieve a price between 50 and 100
per cent of the value of
that beast expressed in terms of its meat value at the time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What percentage do you say is the mark-up that you would allow in
relation to such a beast at that time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Your question is too general.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Mr Madigan, you've said in your affidavit that you appraised these
animals on Jeogla based on your knowledge of the market, including
your
knowledge of the fat sale market that you referred to.  You then said their
meat value, their pregnancy status and their condition.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you also have regard to the fact of their breeding?  You said that
you did.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>In relation to cows on Jeogla did you consider there to be a
margin that they would enjoy in the commercial cattle market for breeding
cattle over and above the price they'd obtain as meat?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes, I did.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>What mark-up above the value as meat would you expect to
achieve selling the animals on a per head basis as commercial breeding
animals?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>At the time probably about 20 per cent</cite><i>.   . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But in doing all that - is this right - you formed a view of what they
might be worth as meat and brought that up by 20 per cent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, as a base price.  I put in a base price which was what I thought
they would achieve if they were to go to meat and that would
be the base price
to start working from.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That meat price reflected their quality and status and so on and so
forth?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Then you added a mark-up to allo0w for the fact that they were well-bred
Jeogla breeding cattle;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That margin you say was 20 per cent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A	Yes, thereabouts, but different aged cattle would have had different -
would have been worth more being younger.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you ever get to 100 per cent of the meat value?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't - I don't believe so, no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What range of mark-up did you increase the cattle above their meat
value?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I didn't work it out on a percentage.'</i>

<i>	</i><b>Receiver's duty of care </b>
<P>

391	A question arises as the proper construction of s420A of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>. 
<P>

392	As has already been noted, the bank contended in opening submissions that
on its proper construction, s420A does not impose
upon a mortgagee a duty to
take reasonable care to ensure that property is sold for not less than market
value. Rather:
<P>

	<i>Section 420A is framed in the alternative. It does not require the
mortgagee to obtain the better of (a) or (b). Clearly the section
imposes no
requirement that the property be sold at any particular time. Thus, if a
mortgagee chooses to sell quickly in a "forced
sale" it has no duty to obtain a
price which is not less than the market price; see section 420A(1)(a). The only
duty then is to
obtain the best price reasonably obtainable having regard to
the circumstances existing when the property is sold; see section 420A(1)(b).
This is consistent with the common law duty expressed in cases such as Barns v
Queensland National Bank Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%20925" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3 CLR 925</a> at 942-943; Pendlebury v

<P>

393	The reference to `mortgagee' in the above submission was plainly intended
to be a reference to the `receiver and manager', a
receiver and manager having
been appointed in the present case under the mortgagee's debenture and having
the requisite control of
the property pursuant to s9 of the Act.
<P>

394	In final submissions, the Bank contended that on the evidence, it is
unnecessary for the Court to decide what is the proper
construction of Section
420A(1)(a) and (b).  The Bank's submission was that `no question arises as to
whether there is any difference
between the duties owed by Mr Skinner depending
upon whether limb (a) or limb (b) applies.  This is because Mr Skinner took all
reasonable
care to sell the relevant property for the value or price specified
in both limbs'.
<P>

395	The Bank, if the above submission was not accepted, adopted the view as to
construction put by Young J in <i>Fisher &amp; Lightwoods Law of Mortgage</i>
(Australian Edition) paragraph 18.10 at page 366 and by L. Aitken in <i>The
Receivers Duty in Equity</i>: <i>The impact of Statute and the Privy

	<b>General law</b>
<P>

396	Before the introduction of s420A, the courts tended to apply the analogy of
the mortgagee exercising the mortgagee's power of
sale to define the source and
nature of the duty imposed on a receiver when selling receivership assets.
<P>

397	There is clear authority for the proposition that a mortgagee is not a
trustee of the power of sale for the mortgagor. Cf <i>Commercial and General
Acceptance Ltd v Nixon &amp; Anor </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 70</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20152%20CLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 152 CLR 491</a> per Gibbs CJ at 494;
Aickin J at 515.  Upon accrual of the power of sale, the mortgagee is entitled
to exercise the power for his
or her own benefit. Cf <i>Re B Johnson &amp; Co

<P>

398	A receiver appointed to enforce a security is primarily responsible to the
appointing security holder.  The receiver's primary
purpose is to gather in and
realise the charged assets of the company to which he or she has been appointed
and to apply the proceeds
of sale to the satisfaction of the claims of the
appointing mortgagee. Notwithstanding this primary consideration, a receiver is
obliged also to have regard to the interests of the company. This obligation
arises by virtue of the receiver being also the agent
of the debtor company.
The interests of the appointing mortgagee and the debtor company are not
necessarily synonymous.  It is for
this reason that Professor O'Donovan
suggests that a receiver and manager enjoys a "schizophrenic status": `The
Duties and Liabilities
of a Receiver and Manager Appointed out of Court' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/1979/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] MelbULawRw 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2012%20Melbourne%20University%20Law%20Review%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979)
12 <i>MULR</i> 52</a> at 52.
<P>

399	The nature and source of the duties owed by the receiver have been
differently described in Australia, England and New Zealand:
see article by
Aitken L. (supra);  <i>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  v
Carnegie</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, 16 June 1987, Crockett J).

<P>

400	In Australia, it has long been clear [as it is now clear in England and New
Zealand, following the Privy Council decision (on
appeal from the New Zealand
Court of Appeal) in <i>Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd</i>
[1993] 2 WLR 86], that the source of the duty of a receiver and manager is
based not upon principles of negligence, but upon the
obligations imposed upon
a mortgagee in equity. As such, the duty, owed to the mortgagor and subsequent
encumbrancers, has not been
seen as dependent on any test of proximity,
although the word has been used to describe the relationship (<i>Cuckmere Brick
Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd</i> [1971] 1 Ch 949 at 966). 
<P>

401	The extent of the duty imposed upon a receiver in selling assets over which
he or she has been appointed was clearly set out
by Needham J in <i>Expo
International Pty Ltd v Chant</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20NSWLR%20820" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 NSWLR 820</a> at 834: 
<P>

	<i>`[T]he duty to exercise his powers in good faith (including a duty not to
sacrifice the mortgagor's interests recklessly); to act
strictly within, and in
accordance with, the conditions of his appointment; to account to the mortgagor
after the mortgagee's security
has been discharged, not only for the surplus
assets, but also for his conduct of the receivership.' </i>
<P>

402	These duties clearly fall short of a negligence-style duty, wherein a
receiver would be obliged to take reasonable care in selling
assets. As such,
at general law there is a symmetry between the general duties imposed on
receivers and their duties in exercising
the power of sale: see O'Donovan,
<i>Company Receivers and Managers </i>LBC, 2nd edition at 4011.
<P>

403	McLelland J in <i>Hawkesbury Valley Developments Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v
Custom Credit Corporation Ltd &amp; Ors </i>(Unreported, Supreme Court of New
South Wales, 9 December 1994) set out a comprehensive examination of the
receiver's duty at general
law:
<P>

	<i>`It is necessary to consider the nature and extent of the relevant
obligations owed by the mortgagee to the mortgagor when exercising
the
mortgagee's power of sale, independently of such statutory provisions as ss.232
and 420A of the Corporations Law, the enactment
of which was subsequent to the
relevant events in the present case.</i>
<P>

<i>	The powers of sale exercised by Custom Credit were statutory powers
conferred by s.58 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>. That section empowers a mortgagee
to "sell the land mortgaged ... or any part thereof ... either altogether or in
lots by public
auction or by private contract, or both such modes of sale, ...
subject to such conditions as he thinks fit ...". In exercising the
power thus
conferred, the mortgagee is, however, subject to obligations arising from the
application of equitable principles equivalent
in nature and extent to the
obligations similarly arising  in respect of legal or equitable mortgages under
the general law (as is
implicit in the decision in Pendlebury v Colonial Mutual
Life Assurance Society <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1912] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=13%20CLR%20676" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">13 CLR 676).</a>  </i><cite>Those obligations apply to the
exclusion of any duty of care arising from the principles of the law of
negligence </cite><i>(Coroneo v Australian Provincial Assurance Association 35
SR 391; Colin D Young v Commercial and General Acceptance (Court of Appeal
24
August 1982 unreported); Downsview v First City Corporation 1993 AC

<P>

<i>	The extent and scope of the relevant equitable obligations were considered
by the High Court in Pendlebury. That case is authority
for the proposition
that in exercising its power of sale, a mortgagee must act in good faith, which
involves an obligation to deal
fairly with the interests of the mortgagor,
which in turn involves an obligation to refrain from acting in wilful or
reckless disregard
of those interests.</i>

in Pendlebury, although in Bangadilly a mortgagee was said by Aickin J (with
whose
judgement Stephen and Jacobs JJ agreed) to be in breach of its obligation
to the mortgagor where there was "a serious departure from
accepted standards
in seeking to obtain the best price then available" (at 288). This is an area
of the law where particular phrases
used in judgements should not be construed
and applied as if embodied in an Act of Parliament (cf Australian Apple &amp;
Pear Marketing
Board v Tonking <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1942/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1942] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=66%20CLR%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">66 CLR 77</a> at 110). What matters is the
underlying equitable principle, which in the modem idiom usually finds
expression in terms of unconscionability.
The mortgagee in equity is not
answerable for what Isaacs J in Pendlebury describes (at 700) as "mere
negligence or carelessness
in carrying out the sale". Any departure from
reasonable standards must be so serious as to be properly characterised as
unconscionable,
in order to render the mortgagee accountable. If a failure by a
mortgagee to take reasonable steps to obtain a proper price is sufficiently
serious to be characterised as unconscionable as that expression is understood
in equity, then in the taking of accounts between
the mortgagee and the
mortgagor, the mortgagee will be accountable on the basis of wilful default for
the price which would have
been obtained if the mortgagee had not been guilty
of unconscionable conduct.'</i>
<P>

404	The Privy Council, in <i>Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation
Ltd</i> [1993] 2 WLR 86, observed that in the absence of any statutory
provision, "the only limitations on the exercise of power by a receiver
and
manager are the requirements to act in good faith for the purpose of preserving
and realising the assets for the benefit of the
debenture holder" [at 99].
<P>

	<b>Section 420A</b>
<P>

405	Section 420A of the Corporation Law, which came into operation on 23 June
1993, now clearly imposes a higher standard of duty
to that previously in place
on a controller when selling property of a corporation. 
<P>

406	Under this statutory duty, `controllers', defined in s9 of the Act to
include a receiver or receiver and manager, are required
to take all reasonable
care to sell property under their control where there is a market value at the
time of sale, for not less
than that market value, or, if there is no market
value at the time of sale, at the best price reasonably obtainable, having
regard
to the circumstances existing when the sale is effected.
<P>

407	L. Aitken, in the above article, observes that `it is not immediately clear
how the general equitable principles controlling
the duties of a mortgagee
exercising a power of sale will interrelate with the new statutory position'
[at p 119]. However, he expresses
the view that `it is arguable that there is
now a <u>general</u> duty to take reasonable care in the management of a
business which is imposed upon a controller of a company, including a receiver,
under section 232, and a <u>specific</u> duty imposed by section 420A to sell
and obtain either the market value or the best price which may be obtained'.
The proposition
advanced is that section 232, which imposes a potential general
liability on those in charge of a company for failing to protect
its best
interests, whilst directed principally at directors, could extend in
appropriate circumstances to include a receiver.  The
author suggests that the
specific duty imposed by s420A appears to replace with a duty to take
`reasonable care, the previously applicable
equitable standard which required
good faith and an absence of mala fides in the exercise of the power of sale
(at 120, 121). The
author concludes that despite the `legislature's obvious
desire to tinker with the receivers' duty to render them more "accountable"
than they are in equity, the end result in future cases will be no different
from that ordained by the lucid guidance already provided
in <i>Chant</i>' [at
132].
<P>

408	O'Donovan, <i>Company Receiver's and Managers</i>, 2nd edition, LBC makes
clear that while the terms of the new statutory duty are reminiscent of the
Court of Appeal's test in <i>Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd
</i>[1971] 1 Ch 949, this general law test was never part of Australian law.
Rather,
<P>

	<i>`Section 420A represents a significant extension of the duties of
mortgagees and receivers who exercise a power of sale. It should
not be seen as
a logical codification of the general law applied by Australian Courts. It is a
radical departure from those general
law principles which will continue to
apply, except where the mortgagee or the receiver is exercising a power of
sale.'</i> [para 11.20, at 4012-13]
<P>

409	Clearly, the language of the section, "market value", "best price
reasonably obtainable", calls for objective standards to be
used to determine
the extent of the receiver's duties in exercising a power of sale. Accordingly,
a receiver will generally be required
to obtain independent valuations of the
property and advice as to the appropriate method of sale in order that the
market value or
best price be realised. [<i>Cf O'Donovan</i> at 4056]
<P>

410	When the draft <i>Corporate Law Reform Bill</i> was circulated for public
comment in February 1992, the proposed s420A required receivers only to take
all reasonable care to sell
property for the best price reasonably obtainable.
It included no reference to `market value'. This was in accord with the
recommendation
in para 234 of the Harmer Report, which avoided such reference
in view of submissions put to it that "obtaining a true market value
is costly
and difficult for partly manufactured goods or products with a limited market"
(para 235). However, when the Bill was introduced
into Parliament on 3 November
1992, it included the term `market value'. Cf A. Keay, `The uncertainty ends:
The receiver's duty of
care when selling assets'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2067%20Law%20Institute%20Journal%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 67 <i>Law Institute
Journal </i>398</a> at 399.
<P>

411	The Explanatory Memorandum does not explain why the term `market value' was
included in the Bill after being omitted in the
draft Bill. However, it does
provide some assistance in ascertaining the purpose of the section:
<P>

	<i>`It is sometimes said of receivers that they are prepared to sell property
at a price less than the best obtainable, so long as it
is sufficient to cover
the debt of the chargeholder who appointed them. Proposed section 420A makes it
clear that, in selling company
property, a controller (to be defined in section
9 to mean a receiver and any other person who has control of company property
under
a charge, such as a mortgagee in possession) must take all reasonable
care to sell the property for the best price that is reasonably
obtainable,
having regard to the circumstances existing when the property is sold. This
formulation is based upon a New Zealand provision.'
</i> [para 585]
<P>

412	What then did Parliament intend to be meant by `market value'?
<P>

413	The concept of 'market value' was incorporated into the law of bankruptcy
by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/blaa1996334/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996</a></i> (Cth), replacing the
concept of 'valuable consideration' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s120.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss120</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">122</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act

Amendment Bill 1996</a></i> (Cth), 'market value' is:
<P>

	<i>'[I]ntended to refer to the value of the property concerned if it were
disposed of to an unrelated purchaser bidding in a market on
an ordinary
commercial basis for property of the kind disposed of, without any sort of
discount or incentive for purchase being offered....
[it] is not intended to
include a situation where the property was being disposed of at a 'fire sale',
at discounted prices because
of some immediate need on the part of the owner to
liquidate his or her assets.</i> [at para 84.13]
<P>

414	This statement clearly draws on the statement of Isaacs J in <i>Spencer v
The Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/82.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] HCA 82</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%205%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 5 CLR 418</a> at 441:
<P>

	<i>'To arrive at the value of the land at that date, we have, as I conceive,
to suppose it is sold then, not be means of a forced sale,
but by voluntary
bargaining between the plaintiff and a purchaser, willing to trade, but neither
of them so anxious to do so that
he would overlook any ordinary business
consideration. We must further suppose both to be perfectly acquainted with the
land, and
cognisant of all circumstances which might affect its value, either
advantageously or prejudicially, including its situation, character,
quality,
proximity to conveniences or inconveniences, its surrounding features, the then
present demand for land, and the likelihood,
as then appearing to persons best
capable of forming an opinion, of a rise or fall for what reason soever in the
amount which one
would otherwise be willing to fix as the value of the
property.</i>
<P>

415	In <i>Spencer</i>, Griffiths CJ held at 432 that:
<P>

	<i>'... the test of value of land is determined, ... by inquiring: "What would
a man desiring to buy the land have had to pay for it
on that day to a vendor
willing to sell it for a fair price but not desirous to sell?"</i>
<P>

416	This test, enabling an objective determination of an hypothetical value,
was applied by the majority of the Queensland Court
of Appeal in <i>Emerson v
Custom Credit Corporation Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20Q%20ConvR%2054%2d431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) Q ConvR 54-431</a> at 59-326.
<P>

417	Mr Graham Peart, who gave both written and oral evidence at the hearing,
reiterated the <i>Spencer</i> definition of "fair market value", stating
further that it `is represented by the contract price that can be achieved
where a property
is formally marketed to the widest possible audience of
appropriately financed potential buyers both within Australia and overseas'.
According to Mr Peart, this involves promoting the benefits of ownership, such
as financial and lifestyle if appropriate.  [Affidavit
21 December 1998, para
2]
<P>

418	In my view, the new section does not affect the pre-existing position
insofar as a mortgagee's entitlement to in fact exercise
a power of sale is
concerned.  By definition, the mortgagee has become entitled to exercise a
power of sale.  Hence, the proper construction
of the new section takes as a
given, that it deals with the exercise of a power of sale by a controller.
Granted then that a mortgagee
or receiver appointed by the mortgagee has become
entitled to exercise the power of sale, the section operates to require that
all
reasonable care is taken to sell the property for its market value.  The
concept of absence of a market is difficult to grasp.  P.A.
Gardy,
`Controllers' Duties on Sale: Section 420A of the Corporation Law, Volume  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20Insolvency%20Law%20Journal%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3,
(1995) Insolvency Law Journal 182</a>, at 188 suggests that perhaps the goodwill of
a business may in certain circumstances be an example of an asset which does
not have
a market value and yet can be sold.  Fortunately the present case does
not require that the Court treat with what conceivable circumstances,
if any,
could amount to a situation in which property may have no market value.
<P>

419	Professor Lang  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20136%20ANZConv%20R%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 136 <i>ANZConv R</i> 451</a> observes:
<P>

	<i>`Section 420A introduces the somewhat novel concept of property which has
no value. This author would argue that, on the basis of
value, in accordance
with the classic statement in Spencer v The Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/82.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] HCA 82</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%205%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 5 CLR 418</a>,
every property has a determinable market value, even if the property is very
unusual and the market (ie demand and supply) is virtually
non-existent.
Nevertheless, this distinction is of little importance, because the test in sec
420A(1)(b) is effectively identical
in practical terms with the test in sec
420A(1)(a) when the property has a market value.' </i>[at 454]
<P>

420	Clearly section 420A imposes no requirement that the property be sold at
any particular time, for instance, that the sale be
postponed until a more
favourable purchase price may be obtained: cf <i>Barns v Queensland National
Bank Ltd &amp; Anor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%20925" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3 CLR 925</a> at 943; <i>Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit

market value is directed to avoid the situation that gave rise to the
proceedings
in <i>Standard Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20WLR%201410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1
WLR 1410.</a> In that case, a receiver disposed of huge metal presses and moulding
equipment, having a potential world-wide market, at a poorly
advertised and ill
attended auction. Lord Denning MR held at 1415 that the receiver had failed to
obtain the "best possible price
which the circumstances .... permit".
<P>

421	Lightman and Moss in <i>Law of Receivers of Companies</i> Sweet and Maxwell
(1986) at 72, n22, point out that it has not yet been decided by cases dealing
with `market value', whether:
<P>

	<i>`..a  receiver, who knows the market is very bad, is entitled to go ahead
and sell at a bargain price. The debenture holder's understandable
wish for an
early realisation may be incompatible with obtaining the absolute maximum
price.'</i>
<P>

422	Aitken, who cites the above question to `encapsulate' the problems
associated with the section, makes the following observations:
<P>

	<i>`Finally, it may be asked metaphysically, how does one sell for "more" or
"less" than the market value if the sale takes place in
the "market"? What
appears to be contemplated is the introduction by a side-wind of an undefined
receiver's obligation to delay a
sale until a low "market" is replaced over
time by a strong one. The introduction of the notion of "market value", which
may have
been intended to allow the receiver to assess the extent of his or her
duty more precisely, will probably only increase the opportunities
for
second-guessing and the adducing of expert evidence with all the benefits of
hindsight that necessarily entails.'</i> [at 122]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Queensland, Victorian provisions</b>
<P>

423	Section 420A is close to word perfect with s85(1) of the <i>Property Act
1974 </i>(Qld), which requires mortgagees, in the exercise of a power of sale,
`to take reasonable care to ensure that the property is sold
at the market
value'. 
<P>

424	Likewise, in Victoria, a mortgagee is required to exercise reasonable care
in the sale of secured property. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/tola1958160/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 77</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/tola1958160/" class="autolink_findacts">Transfer of Land Act
1958</a></i> (Vic) requires the mortgagee to act `in good faith and having regard
to the interests of the mortgagor, grantor or other persons'.
That section was
interpreted by Murphy J in <i>Goldcel Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (Provisional
Liquidator Appointed) v Network Finance Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1983/86.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] VicRp 86</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20VR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 VR 257</a> at 261 to
require that the `mortgagee, on selling, must take reasonable steps to ensure
that at the time of sale, he is getting the
best price then available for the
mortgaged property'.
<P>

	<b>Further statutory duties</b>
<P>

425	Subsection 420A(2) makes clear that the section is not intended to limit
the duties visited on receivers pursuant to s232, already
referred to above.
<P>

426	Of particular relevance to s420A are, subsections 232(2) and (4), which
provide respectively that a receiver and manager of
a corporation should `at
all times act honestly in the exercise of his or her powers and the discharge
of the duties of his or her
office' and that a receiver and manager `exercise
the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in a like position in
a corporation would exercise in the corporation's circumstances'.
<P>

	<b>Finding as to the bank's submission on the proper construction of
s420A</b>
<P>

427	In my view, s420A is not intended to provide an 'either or' approach.
Rather, subsection 420A(1)(b) only comes into effect if
subsection s420A(1)(a)
cannot apply, the property having no 'market value'. There is no requirement in
the section that the price
obtained be the better of (a) or (b).
<P>

	<b>Whether, and to what extent, a receiver may defer to the advice of an
expert</b>
<P>

428	<i>Commercial and General Acceptance Ltd v Nixon &amp; Anor </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 70</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20152%20CLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 152
CLR 491</a>, involved an action for damages against the appellant mortgagee for
breach of duty imposed by s85(1) of the <i>Property Act 1974</i> (Qld). In that
case, the mortgagee retained reputedly competent agents to advertise and
conduct the auction of the secured property,
being a caravan park near
Bundaberg, following default by the mortgagor. The mortgagee instructed the
agents that the sale be advertised
in a Brisbane paper, which circulated
through Queensland.
<P>

429	The auction proved unsuccessful and the land was sold by private treaty for
$55,000. The trial judge found that while local
advertising of the auction was
satisfactory, regional advertising was inadequate. The property was advertised
in the Brisbane paper
once only and only two days before the auction. The trial
judge held that had the property been properly advertised, it would have
fetched $80,000. He gave judgement for the mortgagor, equivalent to the
deficiency in the price obtained. The question arose as to
whether it was
correct to hold the mortgagee liable for the sale of the property at less than
its market value as if it had been
personally at fault, or whether a mortgagee
would discharge its statutory duty to take reasonable care by employing
reputable agents
and taking such other steps as may be reasonable in the
circumstances. 
<P>

430	The High Court held that although it was the agents who had been negligent,
the mortgagee was liable for the deficiency.  Gibbs
CJ so held because the
statutory duty imposed by s85(1) to take reasonable care to ensure that the
property was sold at market value,
was not satisfied by simply delegating the
duty to another, be they agent or independent contractor (at 498).  
<P>

431	Gibbs CJ stated at 495 that:
<P>

	<i> `A reasonable man, selling his own property by auction, and wishing to
obtain the market value, would not allow the auctioneers a
free hand to
advertise in whatever manner they thought fit; he would make reasonable
endeavours to ensure that the advertising proposed
was adequate. It is not
unduly burdensome to require a mortgagee to exercise similar care.'</i>
<P>

432	His Honour noted the comments of Vaisey J in <i>Reliance Permanent Building
Society v Harwood-Stamper</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%201%20Ch%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] 1 Ch 362</a> at 373, a case involving s10 of
the <i>Building Societies Act 1939</i> (UK), being a similar provision to
s85(1):
<P>

	<i>`I think that the `reasonable care' which has to be taken is to make sure,
to assure oneself, that the price at which the estate is
proposed to be sold is
the best price which can reasonable be obtained.'</i>
<P>

433	Similarly, Mason J stated at 503:
<P>

	<i>`The power is exercised primarily on behalf of and for the benefit of the
mortgagee by his agent in whose selection the mortgagor
has no say. The agent
acts in accordance with the instructions of the mortgagee and has no
independent discretion to exercise except
in so far as the mortgagee may choose
to leave arrangements for the sale in the hands of the agent. It is not unfair
or unreasonable
in this situation that the mortgagee should have the
responsibility for the taking of reasonable care to ensure that the market
value
is obtained, </i><cite>including the responsibility for adequate
advertising of the sale. He should satisfy himself that the property has been
advertise
[sic] in accordance with his instructions - that, after all, is what
a prudent vendor would do in the circumstances</cite><i>.'   </i>[Emphasis
added]
<P>

434	Mason J, in concluding that there are "sound reasons for imposing on the
mortgagee a stronger duty than that of trustee, cited
Cross LJ in <i>Cuckmere
Brick</i>:
<P>

	<i>`A trustee has not, qua trustee, any interest in the trust property, and if
an agent employed by him is negligent, his right of action
against the agent is
an asset of the trust. A mortgagee, on the other hand, is not a trustee and if
he sues the agent for negligence
any damages which he can recover belong to
him.'</i>
<P>

435	Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ so held on the ground that the statutory duty
imposed by s85(1) was one which could not be delegated
so as to relieve the
mortgagee of that duty.
<P>

436	Mason J, while observing that the mortgagee was a finance company, being an
institutionalised lender experienced in the sale
of properties, made the point
that: 
<P>

	<i>`. . . it is not unreasonable to require mortgagees generally, whether
experienced or not, to bear the responsibility of seeing that
adequate steps
are taken to ensure that property is sold at the market value'.</i>
<P>

437	These observations have particular significance in assessing the receiver's
conduct in the present case.  As will appear from
what follows, the receiver's
claim to have discharged his statutory duty by delegating the duty to the
agents retained to advise
in relation to and to act on the sale of the cattle
is rejected.
<P>

	<b>Dealing with the plaintiffs' Section 420A case</b>
<P>

438	The primary question is whether, in exercising the undoubted power of sale
in respect of the sale of the Hernani cattle, the
Jeogla property and the
Jeogla cattle, the Second Defendant took all reasonable care to sell that
property, if it had a market value
at the time of the sale for not less than
that market value.  The Court's consideration of the primary question involves
as one parameter,
the question of whether, when the property was sold, it had
any and if so what, market value.  In the event that the property were
to be
found not to have had a market value at the date of sale, the section
420A(1)(b) test directs attention at whether the defendants
took all reasonable
care to sell the property for the best price that was reasonably obtainable
having regard to the circumstances
existing when the property was sold.
<P>

439	In terms of an internal dictionary, the words "market value" and "market
price" are hereafter used interchangeably. Where it
is necessary to
differentiate between these expressions, that differentiation will appear from
the body of the judgement.
<P>

440	The Court's finding is that at the date when the Hernani cattle and later
the Jeogla cattle and property were sold, that property
did have a market
value. In consequence, it becomes unnecessary to treat with the s420A(1)(b)
test which is not enlivened.
<P>

441	Before turning to the evidence, it is convenient on an overview basis, to
note that there is, in reality, a dimensional difference
in this case between
the two approaches put forward by the parties as to the proper way of obtaining
a market price for the Jeogla
and Hernani cattle.
<P>

442	The plaintiffs assert that the proper way to value the cattle was by
assessing the value in a dispersal sale as such.  Realisation
of this value
would see the complete disposal of the herd on a per head basis, as distinct
from selling per kilogram of live weight.
 At a complete dispersal sale, as
contemplated by the plaintiffs, the marketing of the sale would be properly
directed at the breeding
side of the beef cattle industry.
<P>

443	The defendants assert that the method employed by the receiver in valuing
the cattle, being to value the Hernani and Jeogla
cattle respectively on a per
kilo price extrapolated from the meat prices obtained from various fat sales,
represented proper market
value.  The defendants submit that the marketing
undertaken in respect of the sale of the herd, as locked into the land
transaction,
secured the sale of the cattle at the proper market price as
evidenced by the receiver's valuation.
<P>

444	Having looked carefully at the various figures put forward by the parties,
I am satisfied that as the plaintiffs submit, this
is `not a case where there
is a minor or argumentative discrepancy between two assessments of value'.
Indeed, the difference in values
obtained when assessing the cattle on a per
head basis as for a dispersal sale on the one hand, and on a per kilo basis as
for a
production sale on the other, is so extreme that clearly a determination
as to the proper method of valuation so as to achieve a
market price, is
required.  
<P>

445	I turn now to examine the evidence.
<P>

	<b>Hernani Cattle</b>
<P>

446	Contrary to the defendants' final submissions [paragraph 6], to my mind, it
was clear from the receiver's evidence that he primarily
relied in his approach
to the sale, and in particular, in forming his views as to reasonably
anticipated prices and the appropriate
market, on Mr Madigan's appraisals and
opinions.
<P>

447	It is clear from Mr Madigan's evidence that his 19 March 1998 estimate of
price was based on the prices achieved at the Armidale
fat cattle sales
occurring on that day which were detailed in the Livestock Market Detailed
Cattle Report issued by the National
Livestock Reporting Service.  To the
extent that Mr Madigan also gave evidence that his estimate was based on his
`knowledge of the
market', which term he said was meant to incorporate markets
additional to the Armidale fat sales market, being store sales in the
district
and in the eastern states and previous Jeogla sales, I reject that evidence.
The whole of Mr Madigan's cross-examination,
and in particular his failure to
keep records of information which he said had been gleaned from referring to
sales otherwise than
the Armidale fat sales, satisfied me that his source of
reference in relation to the Hernani cattle prices was at all material times,
relevantly confined to the Armidale fat sales, to which he expressly referred
in his affidavit and in his correspondence with the
receiver.
<P>

448	It is likewise clear from the evidence that Mr Madigan's 7 May 1998
estimate of price, following his inspection of the Hernani
cattle on 1 May
1998, used as a sole source of reference the Armidale fat sale prices, achieved
at the Armidale sale on 7 May 1998.
 Mr Madigan's own words in his letter to
the receiver of 8 May 1998 were :
<P>

	<i>`I have put an estimate on prices based on the Armidale Sale on 7 May 1998
(Market Report attached).'</i>
<P>

449	To the extent that Mr Madigan under cross-examination sought to move away
from that sentence in his letter, or to place a gloss
upon that sentence, the
evidence is rejected.
<P>

450	It may not be without relevance that at the time of the 7 May 1998 Madigan
assessment, Mr Madigan was aware of Mr Dellow's then
offer of 77 cents per kilo
live weight.  Mr Madigan's assessment came in at 2 cents below that offer.
This is not to suggest that
Mr Madigan did anything otherwise than to carry out
his best endeavours, basing his evidence on prices obtained at the Armidale fat
sale of 7 May 1998, to estimate the price of the Hernani cattle.  The two cent
differential said nothing in relation to the estimate
which would presumably
have been forthcoming had Mr Madigan turned his attention, which on my findings
he did not, to assessing the
dispersal or store cattle market.  Not even Mr
Madigan suggested that the two cent differential could conceivably have
represented,
or did represent, the difference between market value based on fat
cattle sales on the one hand and market value based on dispersal
or store
cattle sales on the other.
<P>

451	To the extent that Mr Madigan's evidence relating to the Dellow `as is
where' basis sale, sought to suggest that if the receiver
had sold the cattle
at auction either at the Armidale sale yards or at Jeogla Station, the receiver
would have incurred significant
costs of transporting the cattle, travel
insurance and costs relating to the sale commission and yard dues, I fail to
follow the
logic said to support Mr Madigan's stated view `that the offer by Mr
Dellow represented a price per kilo at auction of 85c'.
<P>

452	The spreadsheet furnished together with Mr Cotman's submissions dealing
with the Hernani cattle, is adopted as correct and summarises
the Court's
holding as to the market value of the Hernani cattle at the date of the sale.
That spreadsheet is appended as Appendix
8.  To the extent that the defendants
suggested that the plaintiffs' calculations were to be treated `with some
scepticism' because
they assumed that the cattle not inspected by Mr Crowe were
of the order of 500 kilograms per beast, I do not understand that the
weight
could or does affect Mr Crowe's assigned values which are accepted as accurate.
As I read paragraph 5 of the plaintiffs' outline
submissions, the references to
weight were directed at a comparison between the 22 May 1998 production sale on
the one hand, and
on the other hand, the receiver sale price for the herd.  
<P>

	<b>Jeogla</b>
<P>

453	The approach of the receiver to estimating the market value of the Jeogla
cattle was beset with precisely the same difficulties
as have already been
referred to with respect to the receiver's misconceived acceptance of an
estimate based on altogether the wrong
market, for the sale of the Hernani
cattle.
<P>

454	Before turning to examine in detail the Court's assessment of the evidence
in relation to the Jeogla cattle price estimates,
it is, however, convenient to
refer to the important other respects in which the receiver, by his approach to
the auction, on my
findings, failed to act in accordance with the advice he had
received and importantly, failed to attract to the auction prospective
buyers
whose presence is likely to have materially altered the course of events which
in fact took place at and immediately after
the auction.
<P>

455	As has earlier been noted, Hookers' recommendation in its marketing action
plan was that a detailed livestock schedule with
values would be prepared and
would be included in the information memorandum, this to be disclosed as being
the price at which a
right of first refusal in respect of the cattle could be
exercised by a purchaser of the Jeogla land.  Hookers had suggested that
a
premium could be achieved `should the property be promoted in a professional
manner to the widest possible market'.  
<P>

456	Elders also had advised that livestock values be nominated in the contract
either as a set figure or as a range in which the
buyer could nominate his or
her values.  Elders had likewise emphasised the desirability of presenting the
property as a full commercial
trading enterprise with disclosure of trading
figures.
<P>

457	Meares &amp; Associates had also advised that valuations for livestock
ought be made available to those to whom the marketing
campaign was addressed,
such valuations to be taken at the commencement of the marketing campaign.
<P>

458	The detailed cross-examination of Mr Skinner earlier set out, and the
evidence of Mr Nolan, satisfied me that the receiver failed
in the general
promotion of the Jeogla property to cause to bring to the attention of those
reading the promotional materials, either
the fact that there was clearly to be
an option to purchase the cattle at an agreed price or as to what that price
was to be.  The
receiver accepted that the price was not in fact fixed until
the second or third week in August, the primary distribution of the
promotional
materials commencing in early August.
<P>

459	Mr Nolan's thinking was that it would be necessary for the predetermined
nominated price to be communicated to potential purchasers
so that they could
work out what their total budget might be in relation to a purchase of Jeogla
Station and the cattle. However,
in his cross-examination earlier set out, he
made plain his acceptance of the fact that in the marketing campaign that was
constructed,
it was never suggested that the herd was for sale as a separate
component, but that the advertising had at best suggested that the
livestock
<u>might</u> come up for consideration after Jeogla Station had been disposed
of.
<P>

460	As has already been noted, as to the promotional material, Mr Nolan
accepted that the material which he went forward with into
the market place,
started to be circulated in early August and comprised brochures and newspaper
advertisements and entries in the
Hooker magazine in relation to rural land.
This was backed by the prospect of sending out an information memorandum to
persons who
had expressed an interest in the property.  Mr Nolan accepted that
in the first line of advertising material, that is to say the
brochures,
newspapers and magazine entries, it was not stated that the property was being
offered with the option to acquire the
stock at a predetermined price, but
simply stated that the buyer would have the opportunity to acquire the stock or
an option to
buy the stock according to which publication one looked at.  He
accepted that in the information memorandum, it was again disclosed
that while
the purchaser would have the opportunity or the option to acquire the
livestock, it was not stated that it would be at
a predetermined price or as to
what that price was.
<P>

461	Mr Nolan, as has already been noted, further accepted that it was not until
some time late in August that he had any figures
from the receiver in relation
to the price at which the stock might be offered to the market.
<P>

462	A curious matter in relation to the evidence was Mr Skinner's evidence that
at some time, a schedule had been provided to Mr
Nolan identifying the cattle
and including livestock prices.  Mr Skinner was uncertain as to whether that
schedule had been provided
to Mr Nolan at the same time, or subsequent to, the
information memorandum.  Mr Skinner's evidence was that he understood that Mr
Nolan had provided that schedule on to prospective purchasers.  His
understanding in this regard had been gleaned from discussions
with Mr Nolan
and Mr McCarthy.  Mr Skinner accepted, however, that there was no reference to
any such schedule in his affidavit.
 Mr Nolan gave no evidence of any such
schedule, either in the witness box, or in his affidavit.  No such schedule was
referred to
in Mr Madigan's affidavit or in Mr McCarthy's affidavit.  No such
schedule was tendered during the hearing.  At the least, the failure
of the
defendants to clarify what was the content of any such schedule said to have
made its way to prospective purchasers, leaves
the Court in the situation that
the schedule has not been proven.  It appears that the Court may only safely
proceed on the assumption
that on the evidence, the only material received by
those interested in the auction by way of the detail of the prices to be asked
for Jeogla cattle was as part of the contract document.  In short, it was only
those persons who had progressed to such an interest
in the coming auction as
sought to have contract documents submitted to them, who would have, prior to
the auction been seized of
the very important information as to the price to be
the subject of the right of first refusal relating to the Jeogla cattle.
<P>

463	If any schedules were in fact, as Mr Skinner believed, also passed onto
prospective purchasers giving the information as to
livestock price, the
evidence was sufficiently unsatisfactory on this topic as to be left out of
account.
<P>

	<b>Jeogla Cattle</b>
<P>

464	By the letter of 29 July 1998 from the receiver to Mr Madigan already
referred to, Mr Madigan was specifically requested in
giving a market appraisal
of the Jeogla stock, to `give due consideration to the history of breeding and
identification with the
VIV brand'.  Mr Madigan's market appraisal as at 30
July 1998, was furnished by his letter of 4 August 1998 and was an estimate of
`the price on the current market taking into consideration the expected growth
of the cattle in October 1998'.  Mr Madigan deposed
in paragraph 8 of his
affidavit of  30 March 1999 as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The appraisal was based on my knowledge of the market, the VIV brand and
the breeding and the prices achieved at the livestock sale
at Armidale on 23
July 1998 which were detailed in the Livestock Market Detailed Cattle Report
issued by the National Livestock Reporting
Service.'</i>
<P>

465	Mr Madigan's evidence stands at the centre of many of the disputed issues
as to market price. It is necessary to weigh that
evidence carefully against
all of the other evidence adduced. I have come to the view that Mr Madigan's
evidence cannot be regarded
as reliable, principally because of its internal
inconsistency and because Mr Madigan appeared to me, to seek to stand behind
untenable
propositions in a number of areas.  These included the following:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Madigan at transcript 277 and following and elsewhere in his
cross-examination, would not accept a simple proposition which
was plainly made
out on the evidence. The proposition is that one would expect, in a well
advertised sale of high quality commercial
cattle selected for breeding
purposes, that sale to achieve higher prices than the prices obtained for a
production sale of old and
culled cattle, being sold as rejects for breeding
purposes for the reason that they may be infertile or not of an appropriate
standard
of the breeding herd.
<P>

<i>	</i>That the above described proposition was correct is confirmed by the
following matters raised by Mr Cotman's submissions:
<P>

<i>	`(i)	'The evidence is that eight year old cows were "retired" from the
breeding herd on Jeogla and sold in the production sales.
Records for the 1998,
May 22 Jeogla production sale are found at (PX704-714 and 720-721). Included in
that sale were lots of cows
being Lots 13 to 30. The description of the cows is
found in the CALM print outs included in the sale catalogue. There is also a
listing of bids and the effective price per head noted on the sales results
reports. The weight distribution of the cattle is found
in the documenting of
the reserves (PX722-3). That document shows that the average weight of the
cattle varied from 365kg to 504kg.
The prices bid for the animals varied
between an effective 61c per kilo and 85c per kilo. The result of the auction
that was of 314
sound mouthed cows offered for auction the top price was
$420.00 for Lot 13, with an average of $315.00 and 89 broken mouthed cows
were
sold at a top price of $388.00 with an average of $295.00</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	Remarkably, taking the average price of sound mouthed eight year old
cows at $315.00, the sale price struck for the Jeogla cows
(before the 7%
discount is </i><cite>less</cite><i> than that average for all of the 1990 and
1991 (younger) cows. If one takes the broken mouthed cows, at an average of
$295.00, the
same observation applies.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	If one assumes that the cattle retained are the better quality
cattle, as well as being younger than those sold, it is remarkable
that the
receiver's sale price only exceeds the average selling price </i>[I interpolate
that this should read 'top' selling price in place of 'average']<i> at the
production sale of sound mouthed eight year old cows in relation to the 1994
cows. When the broken mouthed cows are reviewed,
the receiver's sale prices
only exceed the top price achieved by a broken mouthed eight year old cow in
relation to the 1994 cows.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	Mr Madigan repeatedly insisted that eight-year-old cows culled out
of the core herd for sale at a production sale were representative
of the core
breeding herd.  I reject that evidence.
<P>

<i>	</i>(c)	Although Mr Madigan had given evidence that in dealing with the
appraisal of the Jeogla herd, he took into account not only Armidale
fat cattle
sales, but also store sales in the district, previous Jeogla sales and
specialty sales on the East Coast of Australia,
he did not keep and could not
refer to any records or notes which he had kept of such information.  [T268.37;
269.10]  Further, Mr
Madigan at transcript 274, having earlier given evidence
that he had taken into account information as to store sales, speciality
sales,
fat cattle sales and the like, in being referred to sundry reports for example,
within `The Land' of particular sales of commercial
herds, denied that one
could treat those sales as being indicative of what might be obtained for the
commercial cattle in a well
conducted or promoted sale of such cattle at about
the time such reports were published.  Here, at transcript 274, Mr Madigan
sought
refuge in the suggestion that variances which may occur in store markets
as between different breeds, different types and different
areas, prevented
reliance being placed on such sales.
<P>

<i>	</i>(d)	Towards the end of his cross-examination, Mr Madigan accepted that
in relation to cows on Jeogla, he considered there to be a
margin that they
would enjoy in the commercial cattle market for breeding cattle over and above
the price they would obtain as meat.
 He was, however, unable to give any
consistent evidence as to how that margin might be computed, or on what basis,
or as to precisely
how he approached the task of including such an integer in
his calculations.  At the end of his evidence, I remained completely confused
as to what precisely Mr Madigan had used by way of any form of benchmark or
reasoning to take into account the significance of including
such a margin in
his calculations of the market sale price for the breeding herd.  Ultimately, I
formed the view that Mr Madigan
took as his principal point of reference the
production sale prices achieved for the sale of fat cows and had not given any
or any
sufficient or proper consideration on any rational or reasoned basis to
what he accepted at transcript 269 was an important matter,
namely, that he:

<P>

<i>	`consider in fixing the appraised value of the beast . . . first of all,
into what market it might most advantageously be sold .
. . [and in] what sort
of circumstances it might be sold'.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(e)	Further difficulties from which Mr Madigan's input cannot be
quarantined, arise in relation to the receiver's reappraisal document.
 I
accept Mr Cotman's submissions on this topic which were in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>	`In the receiver's "Re-appraisal" document apparently generated about 21
August 1998 by the receiver's staff and Mr Madigan . . .
the base price of cows
is increased by a percentage factor described in handwriting on the page as
"Cow Price Increase" of between
8% and 29%.  This re-appraisal of the cows in
August does not appear to follow any particular sense or pattern in regards to
any
information before the Court.  In other words, the percentage appears to be
a product of the re-appraisal rather than the factor
that drives it.  However,
what is conspicuous from the re-appraisal document is the
</i><cite>inconsistency</cite><i> of treatment of the base price of the cow in
the two different categories (autumn and spring).  In the calculation which is
done
the effect of a calf, either in utero or at foot, is excluded by the calf
column, leaving the cow figures standing alone.  However,
this process having
been undertaken, there are different values attributed to the cows of the same
age.  For example, the 1995 cows
as spring Calving are valued more highly than
the autumn Calving but the 1994 autumn Calving are valued more highly than the
spring
Calving but;  the spring Calving for 1993 are more valuable than the
autumn Calving and so forth.  Be that as it may, the nominated
figures as the
"premium price per head" is, for the cattle born in 1992 or earlier,
</i><cite>less</cite><i> than the first sale prices obtained in May for heavy
cows and, as to younger cows, there is only a significant margin over the May
prices in relation to the 1994 and 1995 autumn cows which are priced at
$450.00.  The balance of the prices are within $30.00 or
$40.00 of the May cow
price as quantified in the production sale and the Armidale 28 May sale.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is not at all clear where the "re-appraised" value of the cows came from
given that Mr Madigan expressly denied that he was asked
to readdress the
question of the value of the cow itself after July 1998, T265/40-45. He was
involved in the process of spitting
[sic] out the cow and calf values in
relation to the autumn cows by giving a range of values (not an actual price)
at which the calves
could be removed from the value of the cow and calf
combination.  Thus, he does not claim responsibility for the $180.00 figure
attributed
to the animal described as weaners in the sale schedule save that
implicitly, it is "in the range" that he gave.  See T265/20-40.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Dealing with Mr Crowe's Evidence</b>
<P>

466	In my judgment, Mr Crowe's evidence ought be regarded as reliable and ought
be accepted.  It has generally been summarised earlier.
 Mr Crowe's expertise,
background and familiarity with the cattle was clear.  Notwithstanding that Mr
Crowe had only inspected a
sample of the cattle then running on Jeogla
(approximately 2,500 head of cattle), Mr Crowe's evidence must be read together
with
that of Mr Wright in relation to the paddock book information which
categorised the cattle population according to type, breed and
birth year.
<P>

467	I accept as reliable, Mr Wright's evidence [see generally transcript 81-86
and following] that there was no difference in the
condition of the animals
within each category or description.  I further accept Mr Wright's evidence as
reliable, being evidence
that as to any of the categories of animals, there was
no material difference in the condition of the animals on Jeogla and Hernani.
In this regard, I reject Mr Madigan's evidence to the contrary insofar as he
suggested that disparity between the Hernani and Jeogla
cattle existed.
<P>

468	Mr Crowe's evidence as to value was essentially as follows:
<P>

	(a)	His valuation was as set out in Annexure A to his affidavit.
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	He had approached the valuation on the only basis appropriate in
his view, namely value on a dispersal sale basis.
<P>

<i>	</i>(c)	Valuation of the cattle on the basis of fat cow [per kilo] sale
prices would not, in his opinion, achieve their real market value.
<P>

<i>	</i>(d)	Prices paid by purchasers in the Thursday fat sales at Armidale
would, in his opinion, bear no significant relationship to the
proper valuation
of the Jeogla herd.
<P>

<i>	</i>(e)	It was his expectation that if the cattle he had inspected on 30
May 1998 were sold in the Spring of 1998, they would have commanded
a price 10
to 15% higher than the figures he had nominated in his report.  [T30]  He
attributed that 10 to 15% improvement in value
to:
<P>

<i>	`Firstly, the growth of calves at side or the born new calves that were in
utero back in May, the steers would have grown out, they
would have had an
extra growth and consequently more weight, and coupled with that would have
been the favourable seasonal conditions
that were experienced in a wide area of
New South Wales for the spring of 1998.'  </i>[T32]
<P>

<i>	</i>(f)	As a matter of methodology, it was, in his view, simply incorrect
that in valuing the Jeogla cattle, it would be appropriate to
look at published
Armidale fat sales records and then to add on some premium for the value of the
cattle to reflect that it had come
from Jeogla or VIV brand cattle.  [T47]
<P>

469	In the result, Mr Crowe's valuation is accepted as reliable for the reasons
which he gave.  That valuation may be fairly extrapolated
across all paddocks
in the fashion in due course reflected by Mr Wright's expanded schedule forming
part of Exhibit P20 (being Exhibit
RBAW11 to Mr Wright's statement of 10
December 1998).  In my judgment, Mr Wright's figures require to be updated to
reflect the cattle
growth as at spring 1998.  I am satisfied by the evidence
that recalculation according to the upper limit of 15% is appropriate.
The
reasons are given at transcript 32 line 29 and following.
<P>

470	It is important to note that the plaintiffs do not put their case in terms
of a damages claim, the methodology of which is to
take the meat value of the
animals and to add a premium.  The plaintiffs sought only to test the validity
and credibility of the
figures utilised by Mr Crowe or by Mr Madigan in their
respective calculations against objective market information, being the meat
sales, coupled with the suggested evidence as to the existence of the
significant premium between 50% to 100%.  The plaintiffs here
rely upon the
evidence of Mr Palmer and Mr Peart.  Mr Palmer and Mr Peart's evidence is
accepted as reliable and indeed may be used
as a test in the way the plaintiffs
approach this evidence.  
<P>

471	The spreadsheet furnished together with Mr Cotman's submissions, has been
reworked to take into account what appears to be two
minor errors.  The errors
are as follows:
<P>

	(a)	It is likely that the 1380 calves said to be Jersey calves and said to be
valued by Mr Crowe at $250 each, should be described
as Beefmaker calves and
accordingly valued by Mr Crowe at $220 each [defendants' further submissions on
quantum, paragraph 7]
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	It is likely that the 74 calves said to be mixed calves and said to
be valued by Mr Crowe at $220 each, should be described as
Angus calves of
mixed sex and accordingly valued by Mr Crowe at $250 each.
<P>

The reworked spreadsheet Appendix 9 to the Judgment, records the Court's
holding as to the market value of the Jeogla cattle as
at the date of the sale,
subject to the parties being permitted to address further submissions on the
topic of the two errors, and
subject also to one further question in relation
to which further submissions are also invited.  I refer here to the fact that
Mr
Cotman's spreadsheet appears to apply a further 7% discount to the
difference between Mr Crowe's valuation (adjusted by 15%) on the
one hand, and
on the other, the receiver's actual sale price (which has already been
discounted by the 7%).
<P>

472	I reject the defendants' submission that to the extent that the sale of the
Jeogla cattle has been shown to have been below
the market value for that
property, the Court should infer that the real property, being Jeogla Station,
was sold for an equivalent
premium, or for any premium above the land value.
No evidence to support such a submission was given in anything like sufficient
detail to permit such an inference to be drawn.
<P>

473	It remains to deal with three questions of percentages and approach.  The
first matter involves the defendants' submission that
if the Crowe valuation be
accepted, it ought be discounted by 20%.  That submission was in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>`We have previously submitted that Mr Crowe's valuations cannot be applied.
Even if this submission is not accepted in toto, it is
necessary to adjust the
figures under the headings "Crowe base", "Crowe value" and "Crowe plus 15%" to
allow for the uncertainties
inherent in his type of valuation.  The figures
should therefore be reduced by 20% which was the range conceded by Mr Crowe
(T52...).
Such an adjustment would be particularly apt in the present case
because Mr Crowe did not inspect all the cattle.'</i>
<P>

474	That submission is rejected as of no substance.  The fact that in theory
other valuers may not have agreed with Mr Crowe's valuation
does not result in
the suggested reduction of Mr Crowe's figures by 20%.  These are matters of
evidence and absent evidence adduced
by the defendants from other valuers
supporting a different value to that given by Mr Corwe, Mr Crowe's evidence of
value is accepted.
 Conspiciously, the defendants called no evidence from any
person familiar with the cattle market in September 1998 to suggest that
the
figures derived by Mr Madigan and adopted by Mr Skinner reflected the market
value of the animals at that time.
<P>

475	The second matter relates to the plaintiffs' claim that the 10% to 15%
improvement in value figures given by Mr Crowe, did not
take into account what
was suggested as an overall 5% increase in market prices, discernible across
the board from the saleyard price
figures tendered and dealing with price
movement between May 1998 and September 1998 (Exhibit 19).  I am not satisfied
that the saleyard
price movement disclosed by the documents in evidence,
reflects such a movement in relation to restocker activity.  I reject the
plaintiffs' submission that Mr Crowe's figures be uplifted by a further 5%.
<P>

476	The third matter relates to the receiver's 7% discount, awarded to the
purchaser of the Jeogla cattle.  I accept the plaintiffs'
submission that this
discount was simply a gift to the purchaser so that the purchaser acquired the
Jeogla cattle at a price less
than the assessed value.  There is no evidence
that the transaction in this form avoided significant costs being represented
by that
discount.  Accordingly, the 7% discount will not be reflected in the
figures representing the market value of the cattle, the aggregate
loss to the
plaintiffs being the difference between that value and the price at which the
cattle were sold.
<P>

	<b>Dealing with the Jeogla Real Property</b>
<P>

477	There were no submissions which suggested that the receiver had sold the
real property at less than its market value at the
time of sale.  Insofar as
such a claim was pleaded, it has not been made out.
<P>

	<b>Overall result</b>
<P>

478	In the result, for the reasons set out above, the plaintiffs have succeeded
in establishing that in exercising the subject power
of sale in respect of the
cattle running on Hernani and Jeogla, the receiver failed to take all
reasonable care to sell the cattle
for not less than its market value.  Hence,
a breach of section 420A(1)(a) has been established.  The particular matters
which evidence
the receiver's failure to take reasonable care to sell the
cattle for not less than its market value have earlier been set out. 
Without
seeking to repeat all of those matters or to be exhaustive, of particular
significance amongst those matters are the receiver's
failures:
<P>

	(a)	To take reasonable care to ensure that the property had been properly
advertised, promoted or marketed in accordance with the
advice which he had
received.
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	To give sufficiently early notice of critical matters concerning
the Jeogla auction as would attract to the auction prospective
buyers whose
presence is likely to have materially altered the course of events which took
place at and immediately after the auction
and as would have stimulated the
necessary competition.
<P>

<i>	</i>(c)	To address the correct market in seeking to identify and realise
the market value of both the Hernani and Jeogla cattle.
<P>

479	In further amplification of the matter referred to in (b), in my judgment,
the receiver failed in the general promotion of the
Jeogla property to cause to
be sufficiently brought to the attention of those reading the promotional
materials, either the fact
that there was clearly to be an option to purchase
the cattle at an agreed price or as to what that price was to be.  Such
communication
to prospective purchasers of these matters as in due course did
occur, took place too late to permit the market value of the cattle
to be
procured at an effective and properly promoted auction.
<P>

480	The receiver's claim to have discharged his statutory duty by delegating
the duty to the agents retained to advise in relation
to and to act on the sale
of the cattle is rejected.  The obligation imposed by section 420A(1)(a) is one
which, in the circumstances
of this case, was not discharged by the receiver,
who involved himself in analysing the advice which he received and who in
important
respects, failed to ensure that the advice was carried out.
<P>

	<b>Liability of the Bank</b>
<P>

481	The plaintiffs pursued both the Bank and the receiver in the proceedings.
No separate submissions were advanced with respect
to the question of the
Bank's liability as opposed to that of the receiver.  It seems to me
appropriate to allow both parties with
the benefit of these reasons, to address
such submissions as they may seek to address on the question of whether
judgment is to be
entered only against the receiver or ought extend to include
the Bank and if so, as to the precise suggested basis for the latter
course.
As necessary, a supplementary judgment may require to be delivered dealing with
questions relating to the Bank.
<P>

	<b>Short Minutes of Order</b>
<P>

482	The proceedings will be stood over to permit the parties to bring in Short
Minutes of Order and to address further submissions
on the matters reserved for
such submissions and in relation to costs.  To the extent that the reworked
spreadsheet, Appendix 9 to
the Judgment is concerned, I have earlier in the
Judgment indicated the matters in respect of which further submissions are
invited.
 Those submissions also should include any suggested arithmetic errors
in the reworked spreadsheet.  Finally, leave is reserved to
the parties to
address further submissions on any claim which is said to have been pressed but
not yet dealt with.  I particularly
have in mind the matter of plant and
equipment in respect of which no separate submissions were addressed.
