<b><u>11493/99  -  DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW)  v  SOURASITH
SOUNTHORN</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b>Constable Rachel Dowd laid an
information against the defendant Sourasith Sounthorn alleging an offence
contrary to s527C(1)(c) of
the Crimes Act particulars of which were that he had
$2,020 cash in his possession which may be reasonably suspected of being stolen
or unlawfully obtained.  A hearing commenced at Burwood Local Court on 10
February 1999.  Constable Dowd commenced evidence that
she and other officers
made forcible entry into relevant premises and continued to the point when she
testified that she showed a
search warrant to the defendant and another person
in the premises.  The transcript then notes:
<P>

"OBJECTION. EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED AS COPY OF SEARCH WARRANT NOT SERVED
WITH BRIEF. LEGAL ARGUMENT."
<P>

2   	Mr Kristhenthal the solicitor appearing for the defendant
is recorded as saying that "it (the search warrant) was shown to
him (the
defendant), he retained it for a period of time and then it was subsequently
taken back by the police".  That remark is
not consistent with some responses
of the defendant during police interview when he appeared to claim that the
police had no "paper,
warrant".  
<P>

3   	The learned presiding magistrate requested the assistance
of written submissions in connection with the objection and these
were in due
course provided.  On 31 March 1999 he published a written judgment wherein he
had posed four questions, the answers to
which he regarded as germane to
resolution of issues in the case before him.  The fourth question was, as he
recognized and expressed,
critical.  It is convenient to extract that part of
his judgment namely:
<P>

"<u>Question 4</u>
<P>

This is the critical question i.e. if the search warrant has not been served on
the defendant pursuant to s.66B, is the prosecuting
authority precluded from
adducing evidence of a legitimate search?
<P>

The answer to this question involves an examination of Subdivision 6A of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.  This was inserted into the Act relatively recently and in simple
terms, it requires that a defendant who has pleaded not guilty
be served, at
least fourteen days before the hearing, with all of the material upon which the
prosecution will rely at the trial.
 The intention of the Parliament in
enacting Subdivision 6A seems to have been to put a defendant upon early notice
of the case which
is being brought against him so that he can organize his
defence.  As legislation which reforms the existing criminal procedures,
it
must be interpreted in a non-restrictive, liberal fashion.
<P>

When one looks at the scope of the Subdivision, it follows that if the
prosecution (as in this case) relies upon the issuing of
a search warrant to
justify what would otherwise be an illegal entry to premises, then that warrant
(or a copy of it) must be served
upon the defendant at least fourteen days
before the hearing. It is the search warrant itself - and no other document -
which authorises
entry, search and seizure.
<P>

My answer to question 4 is `yes'."
<P>

4   	After publication of those reasons an adjournment was
granted to enable the parties to examine  the content and as there is
now
dispute about the significance of what followed I will also extract the
transcript record:
<P>

"BENCH:   Well where do we go from here?
<P>

PROSECUTOR:  Your Worship in view of the determination that you've made in
respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66</a> I think I'm precluded from calling any further evidence.
So unfortunately I don't have anything that I can do, so to speak your Worship,
in furthering this case.
<P>

BENCH:   Well it was only in the list today to hand down my reasons I think
wasn't it?
<P>

KRISENTHAL:   Yes, as far as I'm aware your Worship.
<P>

BENCH:    So do you wish not to offer any further evidence, is that what you're
- I mean I'm quite happy to put it over for a day
or two while you consider
your position.
<P>

PROSECUTOR:    That might be appropriate, thank you your Worship.  I would
appreciate that.  Yes, if I could make further inquiries
and consider the
situation then that would certainly assist me.
<P>

BENCH:  See what you're left with I think now is evidence of a forcible entry,
a search and seizure which can't be justified in
terms of a search warrant and
prima facie any evidence resulting from that process would be inadmissible.
<P>

PROSECUTOR:   Yes.
<P>

BENCH:  And unless it were admitted that would be the end of it wouldn't it?
<P>

PROSECUTOR:   Yes your Worship.  And your Worship has made that determination
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66</a> not being complied with or the warrant not being served with
the brief then really I think it may be fruitless to put it over to
another
day.   I think that it might be appropriate to deal with it today your
Worship.
<P>

BENCH:  Well if you're happy to --
<P>

PROSECUTOR:  Yes, well I don't think that an adjournment will assist me any
further based on your Worship's decision.
<P>

BENCH:  Have you got anything you want to say about that, Mr Krisenthal?
<P>

KRISENTHAL:  No your Worship.
<P>

BENCH:  ON THE BASIS THAT THE PROSECUTOR OFFERS NO FURTHER EVIDENCE THE CHARGE
WILL BE DISMISSED."
<P>

5   	This summons was taken out seeking inter alia a declaration
that a search warrant issued under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/" class="autolink_findacts">Search Warrants Act 1985</a>, which is not
identified as a proposed exhibit in a written statement taken from a person the
prosecution intends to call to give
evidence in proceedings for a prescribed
summary offence, is not included in the definition of  "brief of evidence" set
out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s66A(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>.
<P>

6   	By notice dated 19 July 1999 pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/doppa343/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/doppa343/" class="autolink_findacts">Director of Public Prosecutions Act</a>, the Director has taken over these
proceedings in lieu of the plaintiff Constable Dowd.  
<P>

7   	As can be derived from question 4 posed in connection with
the proceedings below, the essential question is whether the search
warrant
which authorized entry, search and seizure was a document encompassed within
the definition of "brief of evidence" in that
part of the statute which
provides:
<P>

"66A	(1)	In this Subdivision:
<P>

<b>brief of evidence</b>, in relation to a prescribed summary offence, means
documents regarding the evidence that the prosecution intends to adduce in
order
to prove the commission of the offence and includes:
<P>

(a)	written statements taken from the persons the prosecution intends to call
to give evidence in proceedings for the offence, and
<P>

(b)	any document, or other thing, identified in such a written statement as a
proposed exhibit."
<P>

8   	The correct answer to the question number 4 posed in the
Local Court was "no".  As revealed in the reasons for judgment published
by the
learned magistrate, he based his opposite conclusion upon an analysis that the
prosecutor relied upon the issuing of the search
warrant to justify what would
otherwise be an unlawful entry whereas the question which ought to have been
addressed was whether
the search warrant was a document "<u>regarding the
evidence which the prosecution intends to adduce in order to prove the
commission of the offence</u>".  The document class therefore relates to
evidence of particular quality related to the intention of the prosecution. The
true construction
of the statutory language is not to be ascertained, as
submitted at one point by the defendant, by attention to the phrase "documents
regarding the evidence" without reference to the qualification following it.
<P>

9   	The search warrant itself was not part of the proof of the
offence by the prosecution.  Its existence (coupled with validity)
was capable
of defeating objection on behalf of the defendant to the admissibility of
evidence concerning entry, search and seizure
but the evidence upon which the
prosecution intended to rely in order to prove the commission of the offence
included the facts of
the entry, search and seizure by police but not as a
matter of evidence the antecedent legal authority for so doing.   It is
recognized
that the specified inclusive examples in subss(1)(a) and (b) of s66A
are not exhaustive but it can be mentioned that it was plain
that the
prosecution did not, as part of its case, propose that the search warrant be
tendered as an exhibit.
<P>

10   	It is worthwhile noting the procedures relative to search
warrants.  Application is made to an authorized justice, and if
granted, it is
obligatory that it issue in a prescribed form: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/" class="autolink_findacts">Search Warrants Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14.</a>  Within
ten days after execution of the warrant or its expiry whichever first occurs,
the applicant must report in writing back to
the issuing justice: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21(2).</a>
Search Warrant reg 8 provides that the report pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21</a> of the Act must
be in or to the effect of prescribed Form 7 and must contain the particulars to
complete that form.  The form provides
that the original warrant is to be
attached to the report unless the report is in fact endorsed on the back of
that original warrant.
 In a voir dire hearing following the objection on 10
February above noted, it was revealed that the original warrant had been "sent
back" to Fairfield Court where, I infer, the issuing justice was located.
<P>

11   	As <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s66B(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> requires service of the
brief of evidence fourteen days before the hearing of the prosecution evidence,
it can reasonably be postulated
that, given the limits specified by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/" class="autolink_findacts">Search Warrants Act</a>, an original search warrant is likely to have passed from
the possession of the applicant and the prosecutor (if the latter ever
had
possession of it) well before a defended hearing would be scheduled.  Of course
the original warrant could be retrieved if for
example an issue as to its
validity were raised at the hearing but it would suffice for proof of a
prosecution case that the appropriate
witness testify that a search warrant was
possessed and produced.  The statutory requirement for service of an occupier's
notice
is not overlooked but it is not a matter of issue in the present
contest.
<P>

12   	In this case the brief of evidence contained a statement
by Constable Dowd which included:
<P>

"7.  Inside the loungeroom I said, `I am Constable Dowd from the Cabramatta
Police Station.  I have a search warrant here to search
the premises for drugs.
Who lives here'.  The defendant said, `I live here for past week'.
<P>

8.  About 11.55am that date, Sergeant O'Keefe activated the video camera.  I
handed the occupier's notice of the search warrant
to the defendant and
explained the contents of the search warrant.  I said to the defendant, `You do
not have to say or do anything,
but anything you say or do may be used in
evidence.  Do you understand that?'  He said `Yes'."
<P>

13   	Testimony to that effect from Constable Dowd was (in part)
the evidence which the prosecution intended to adduce in proof
of the
commission of the offence.  Insofar as it might be suggested that such
testimony given orally involved proof of the content
of the written document
(the search warrant), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(4)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> permitted it.  
<P>

14   	Much of the submission on behalf of the defendant both in
writing and in oral elaboration, was directed to the parliamentary
purpose in
legislating subdivision 6A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.  The Attorney General's Second
Reading Speech made clear the intendment that persons who were the subjects of
summary prosecution
would by service of material know the charge brought
against them and have particulars provided.
<P>

15   	There is in my view no ambiguity in the legislated
definition of the brief of evidence and the requirements of purposive
construction
of statutory language do not mean that in the present context the
prosecution must supply a copy of every document which may possibly
become
relevant in the course of hearing.  The evidence summarized in Constable Dowd's
extracted statement was admissible and it
was that evidence which the
prosecution intended to call in proof of the offence.  If the search warrant
was to become required such
a requirement would have emerged from an objection
seeking to advance a case on behalf of the defendant rather than emerging as
part
of the prosecution case.  In short, whilst it may be foreseen that if the
case took a particular turn, evidence to overcome objection
or evidence in
rebuttal might come to be tendered, the requirement for inclusion in the brief
does not extend to that contingent
material.  
<P>

<u>16   	</u>I add, in deference to express submission by the
defendant, that I am of opinion that proof of lawful authority <u>by tender of
the warrant</u> is not a prerequisite for the admission of evidence of
observations by police upon forcible entry or of items seized by them.  The
case cited, <b>George v Rockett &amp; Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1990%20170%20CLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1990 170 CLR 104</a> does not lead
to, let alone oblige, a contrary view.
<P>

17   	In the event that I came to the conclusion, as I have,
that the fourth question posed in the Local Court ought to have been
answered
in the negative it was submitted that I should refuse relief on discretionary
grounds.  The record of 31 March above recited
was contended to show that the
prosecution declined the opportunity of adjournment and therefore the
possibility of meeting the objection
by obtaining and tendering the warrant and
that it should not in effect be permitted to recant its election to close its
case in
circumstances where the evidence to that point was clearly inadequate
to support the charge.  On behalf of the Director it was submitted
that there
had hardly been an election in the Local Court but rather a recognition that
the reasons of the learned magistrate had
"closed the gate" against tender of
evidence.  The oral testimony of Constable Dowd had been excluded on the ground
that that exclusion
was demanded by the absence of a copy search warrant from
the brief and there could be no different result if the original were produced
and offered for tender because the situation remained that no such copy
document had been included in the brief.
<P>

18   	In the circumstances, I conclude that the dispute should
be remitted for resolution at first instance.
<P>

19   	The current proceedings have been brought in accordance
with new procedures in substitution for those formerly undertaken
by way of
case stated.  If appropriate to the new procedures the defendant should have a
certificate in respect of his costs pursuant
to the Suitors Fund Act.
<P>

20   	The terms of the first prayer in the summons seek a broad
declaration in general terms, it should be made in reference to
the instant
case.  
<P>

21   	I make the following declaration and orders:
<P>

(1)	I declare that the search warrant used to authorize entry, search and
seizure was not a document, a copy of which was required
to be included in the
brief of evidence served by the prosecution pursuant to subdivision 6A of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.
<P>

(2)	I order that the dismissal of the information ordered at Burwood Local
Court on 31 March 1999 be quashed.
<P>

(3)	I order the matter be remitted to the Burwood Local Court for further
hearing and determination according to law.
<P>

(4)	The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of the summons and if
he is qualified and it is available is to have a
certificate under the Suitors
Fund in respect of those costs.
