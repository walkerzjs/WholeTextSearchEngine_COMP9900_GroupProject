<b>4902/98		LORRAINE PROFILIO &amp; 2 ORS v </b>
<P>

<b>ANTONIO PROFILIO</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: These proceedings relate to the estate of the late
Christopher Profilio who died on 26 March 1997.  His last Will
dated 9 May 1968
appointed as executors his wife Mrs Lorraine Profilio, who is the first
plaintiff, and his brother Mr Antonio Profilio,
who is the defendant. They
obtained probate of the Will from this Court on 9 March 1998.
<P>

2  	The Will left the property of the testator on trust for payment
of duties and debts, and the balance of the estate on trust
to pay the net
income to Mrs Profilio during her lifetime, or until she should remarry (and
that has not happened), and after her
death or remarriage for the testator's
children in equal shares.
<P>

3  	There was an alternative provision which was to operate in favour
of the children if Mrs Profilio predeceased the testator,
but that did not
happen.
<P>

4  	The Will also conferred powers on the trustees.
<P>

5  	In their probate application the executors filed an inventory of
property, the total value of which they gave at $1,956,174.50.
 The principal
assets owned by the testator were commercial buildings in High Street, Penrith,
in which he owned a half share as
tenant in common, and Mr Antonio Profilio
owned the other half share. He owned several other investment properties also
as tenant
in common in equal shares with Mr Antonio Profilio, and he owned a
house in Stafford Street Penrith outright.
<P>

6  	The testator had a number of other assets, including undivided
half shares in the estates of three deceased relatives whose
assets were
situated at Lipari in Italy, and he owned a quarter share in the estate of
another relative which was situated in Australia;
the estate owns a house in
Coles Street, Concord.  He had several bank accounts, one in his own name, and
two which he conducted
jointly with Mr Antonio Profilio, in which he owned half
shares.
<P>

7  	There were no duties, having regard to the time of his death, and
debts, if there were any, were attended to readily. The administration
of the
estate consists largely in management of the investment properties and the
monies arising from the income on them, and those
investments are joint
ventures with Mr Antonio Profilio, who is both an executor and also their
co-owner.  That is to say, he has
two different interests to bring to bear on
management and investment decisions.
<P>

8  	Administration of the estate did not proceed on a basis  which
was satisfactory in the view of the first plaintiff.
<P>

9  	In the course of 1998 she and the second and third plaintiffs,
who are the children and the only children of Mrs Profilio and
the testator,
came to some arrangement in which they proposed to resettle the beneficial
interest in the estate assets on some basis
which was less restrictive of Mrs
Profilio.  She sought to obtain Mr Antonio Profilio's concurrence in these
arrangements, but his
concurrence was not forthcoming.
<P>

10  	On 4 December 1998 the plaintiffs issued the summons in these
proceedings, and made claim (1) for an order requiring Mr Antonio
Profilio to
execute documents and do other things necessary to give effect to the
resettlement arrangement, and claim (2) for an
order that he be removed as the
executor and trustee of the estate.
<P>

11  	The plaintiffs asked at the outset of the proceedings for urgent
interlocutory relief and that application came before me on
16 December 1998.
The application only went a little distance when an arrangement was made
between the parties, and I was informed
that Mr Antonio Profilio's counsel had
handed the plaintiff's counsel a signed withdrawal form enabling her to
withdraw a sum of
about $120,000 from an estate account. I was also told that
some arrangements had been made for the preparation of estate accounts,
probably in January 1998, and for their submission for examination. It is the
plaintiff's evidence that until then only very small
sums were actually
available to her out of the estate. The payment made put an end to the urgency
of the application.
<P>

12  	The summons came before me for directions on 19 March 1999 when
there was some discussion, not at all conclusive, about the
state of progress
in the preparation of accounts.  Then, on 18 June the plaintiffs applied for
expedition, and I made the appointment
for hearing today.
<P>

13  	The plaintiffs proceeded today with claim (2), the claim that
the defendant be removed as executor and trustee.
<P>

14  	For good order it would have been as well that there be two
applications, one made in the probate proceedings relating to the
executorship,
and one made in these proceedings and relating to the trusteeship.  However,
since the proceedings were commenced there
have been changes in the divisional
arrangements, and the need to separate probate applications from other business
related to administration
of estates has less force than formerly.
<P>

15  	The case as set out in the affidavits which have been read is,
to summarise it severely, to the effect that there has not been
ready
cooperation between the executors and trustees in the administration of the
estate, so that the administration of the estate
and the realisation of Mrs
Profilio's interest in it have been stultified. The case was not put by her
counsel on any basis of active
misconduct by the defendant.  However the
plaintiffs' evidence shows very lengthy correspondence between solicitors and
also accountants
representing the parties with very little result. Although Mrs
Profilio has incurred liability for income tax on estate income  she
had not,
by 4 December 1998, received anything except $2,000 from the defendant about
the end of 1997 and $4,320, which an estate
agent had paid her directly as rent
on one of the investment properties on one occasion. She had little other
income and was living
in what were, in the light of her entitlements, very poor
circumstances.  Her evidence was that she had suffered enormous emotional
stress as a result of her attempts to settle estate matters; that she could not
go on any longer, felt sick thinking about the matter,
and was depressed.
<P>

16  	In later evidence Mrs Profilio said that she no longer had faith
in the defendant because in many situations he appeared to
her to be looking
after his own interests rather than the estate.  She said she was totally
stressed and frustrated by the lack of
input she had had in the decision making
process
<P>

17  	I have accepted this evidence as establishing her own
perceptions rather than proceeding to any finding on the objective facts
which
may underlie her perceptions.
<P>

18  	At the outset of the proceedings the defendant's counsel made an
opening statement establishing that the defendant does not
wish to contend with
the plaintiffs on the question of his holding office.  His counsel told me that
the defendant had made open
offers to take various steps, including conveying
the estate interest in the properties to others.  His counsel told me that he
had
undertaken the office of executor seriously and had endeavoured to carry
out his duties properly. Counsel told me that the defendant
does not accept the
criticisms to which he has been subjected and does not accept that he has done
anything improper, but accepts
that the first plaintiff no longer wishes to
proceed with the administration of the estate in a joint endeavour with him.
<P>

19  	The defendant proposed that rather than contesting the hearing
on factual matters he would consent to the revocation of the
grant of probate,
which would not, of course, solve all problems relating to the estate, and he
would then attend to any consequential
questions relating to the administration
of assets up to the present.
<P>

20  	The defendant's counsel pointed out that the course which he
outlined would lead to the court being required to consider appointing
other
representatives and attending to accounting for monies in the estate, including
income up to the present.
<P>

21  	In a general way the position outlined by the defendant's
counsel was accepted by the plaintiffs' counsel.
<P>

22  	This appears to me to represent what courts have long regarded
as the appropriate outcome for disputes about office-holding
by trustees. This
is shown by the judgment in <b>Letterstedt v Broers</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%209%20AC%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 9 App Cas 371</a>,
in which the Privy Council, in expressions which have often been repeated by
later judges, urged compromise rather than conflict.
<P>

23  	An outcome which does not involve a contested decision appears
to me to be appropriate and welcome.
<P>

24  	The Court's powers to remove one of several trustees and to
appoint others is well established.  It is not, however, so clear
that a court
can remove one of two executors where there has been a grant of probate to them
both.
<P>

25  	There clearly is a power in a Court of probate to revoke a grant
of probate where conflict or other circumstances have made
it inoperative.  The
existence of this power is well established by the decisions of the Court of
Appeal of New South Wales in<b> Bates v Messner</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2067%20SR%28NSW%29%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 67 SR(NSW) 187</a>
and<b> Mavrideros v Mack </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 18.</a>
<P>

26  	Although there was some basis in well-regarded textbooks for
another view, the view adopted in New South Wales has been based
on
observations of Jeune P in <b>In the Goods of Loveday </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20P%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] P 154</a> at 156,
in a passage which is set out in <b>Mavrideros v Mack</b> by Sheller JA at
pages 101 and 102, in these words:
<P>

<i>"After all, the real object which the court must always keep in view is the
due and proper administration of the estate and the interests
of the parties
beneficially entitled thereto; and I can see no good reason why the court
should not take fresh action in regard to
an estate where it is made clear that
its previous grant has turned out abortive or inefficient.  If the court has in
certain circumstances
made a grant in the belief and hope that the person
appointed will properly and fully administer the estate, and if it turns out
that the persons who are appointed will not or cannot administer, I do not see
why the court should not revoke an inoperative grant
and make a fresh
grant".</i>
<P>

27  	This passage was adopted and commented on by Asprey JA in
<b>Bates v Messner </b>at 191-192 and the Court of Appeal acted on it in its
recent decision. Asprey JA referred to the Court's power as an inherent
jurisdiction
to revoke a grant.
<P>

28  	Of this passage and the later exposition I would make these
observations. The object of the power is the leading consideration
in its
exercise: that is, the due and proper administration of the estate and the
interests of parties beneficially entitled.  An
order which attains that object
is authorised by the inherent power, and there is nothing in the nature of the
inherent power which
limits the form which such an order may take.  There is no
expression of any limit on the power of the Court to remove an executor,
and
the Court's attention is not restricted to cases where the executor himself is
in some way impeached or shown to have misconducted
himself, although in the
nature of things most instances which occur involve some such element.
<P>

29  	Attaining the real object referred to appears to me to mean that
the power can be exercised in cases where a grant of probate
and the
responsibility conferred on the executors are not effectual for a reason such
as exists in this case, where there is simply
an incapacity to achieve
cooperation, and long continuance of discussion about what course should be
taken without effectual outcomes.
 The unsatisfactory nature of the events in
this case is to my mind well illustrated by the circumstances which occurred on
16 December
1998, when after hardly any money had been available to the life
tenant for about 20 months, a large sum became available when the
parties faced
each other in the courtroom. In my judgment that kind of ineffectuality of
administration cannot be allowed to continue.
<P>

30  	The correspondence in Exhibit A is a full demonstration of the
difficulties of administering the estate and the lack of practical
reality
about any expectation of efficiency.  The correspondence shows complaints on
both sides.  Each believes that he or she is
caught up in a stalemate.  The
defendant  cannot get large sums to which he believes himself entitled out of
bank accounts which
hold proceeds of the shared investments, while the first
plaintiff is under a similar difficulty.  Cooperation is needed to unlock
the
keys of the bank accounts, and cooperation is not forthcoming.
<P>

31  	There was lengthy correspondence between solicitors and also
between accountants, and at times there were some testy expressions
in that
correspondence.  However in recent days some common ground appears to have been
established between the two firms of accountants.
 This can be understood from
their correspondence including the last three items:  letter from Woodward
Scarfidi Anderson to Lawrence
Witt Atkins, 24 June 1999, and the reply of 25
June 1999 (being the last documents in Exhibit A) and a further letter of
Lawrence
Witt Atkins of 18 June 1999 produced with the first plaintiff's
affidavit sworn today.  The accountants have reached and recorded
common ground
with respect to entitlements to monies up to 31 January 1999.  Then I have been
told in Court by counsel that there
is common ground covering a further period
to 22 February 1999.
<P>

32  	I have been asked to make, and I feel I should make, directions
which will be based on the agreed position presented to me
and will establish
entitlements at least as far as the directions go, that is up to 22 February
1999 much.
<P>

33  	It is not known to me that there has ever been a case in which
the Court's power to remove an executor has been applied to
a grant of probate
which was first made to two executors, so that one of them is to be removed
while the other is to continue under
the earlier grant of probate.  Counsel
have not been able to refer to any case in which that has been done.
Discussion in texts and
judgments tends to fall into dealing with the matter in
hand as the revocation of the grant of probate, and revocation of the grant
has
been the outcome in the case law which I have seen. It seems to me however that
revocation of the grant of probate is not the
essential subject matter.  The
essential subject matter is the removal of an executor. Where the Court's
inherent power is brought
to bear on a grant which was originally made to more
than one executor there is no departure from the real object of the inherent
power, but rather a fulfilment of it if one executor is removed while the other
is left to act under the earlier grant.
<P>

34  	There is some practical convenience in doing this, as it would
obviate any need for the continuing executrix to make a fresh
application,
which would not be contentious and would only establish matters again which she
earlier established.
<P>

35  	It is significant for my decision to proceed in this way that
the present proceedings, while they are not based on consent
of the parties to
the order which I propose to make, are not now contentious.  The defendant does
not wish to contend against the
plaintiffs' claim for his removal.
<P>

36  	The orders which I make will not, in my understanding, have any
effect on the validity of any step which has been taken by
both executors in
the executorship up to the present time.  The order will not be in any sense
retrospective and  will not form a
basis for questioning the validity of
anything they have done.
<P>

37  	The orders are: In probate proceedings 103116 of 1998 I order
that Antonio Profilio, the second named executor be removed from
the grant of
probate dated 9 March 1998 with effect on and from 28 June 1999, and without
prejudice to the continuing executorship
of Lorraine Profilio.
<P>

38  	In proceedings 4902 of 1998 
<P>

1.	I order that the defendant be removed from office as trustee of the trusts
of the Will dated 9 May 1968 of the late Christopher
Profilio who died 26 March
1997.
<P>

2.	I order that Lorraine Profilio continue in office as trustee of those
trusts.
<P>

3.	I order that Christine Profilio and Glenn Profilio be appointed new trustees
of those trusts to hold office with the continuing
trustee.
<P>

4.	I direct that the following monies be paid out of the joint bank accounts in
which the estate of the testator is interested,
namely, National Australia Bank
accounts 45-447-7575, 33-987-6087, 02-787-5683 and Term Deposit 680851-7410,
<P>

To the defendant $487,367.46.
<P>

To the continuing new trustees $320,901.96.
<P>

5.	I direct that the balance of the monies remain in those accounts and be
applied in accordance with the entitlements thereto to
be established by
agreement among the parties or by further order of the court.
<P>

6.	I order that the costs of each party of these proceedings be paid out of the
assets of the trust.
<P>

7.	Each party has liberty to apply on 5 days notice.
