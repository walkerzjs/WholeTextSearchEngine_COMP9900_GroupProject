<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>WEDNESDAY 17  MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>12785/98 - JULZAR PTY LTD V RODGERS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    This is a case stated by a local court magistrate
hearing a civil claim by the defendants Messrs Rodgers and MacDonald, the
liquidators
of Cypain Pty Ltd (Cypain) to recover alleged preferences.  The
claim made in the local court was that the present plaintiff had
received
preferential payments totalling $32,933.52 from Cypain.  The learned Magistrate
found for the defendants and entered judgment
for $44,658.85 which included
$8,253.33 interest and $3,300 for costs and disbursements.
<P>

2	The plaintiff duly requested the learned Magistrate to state a case, which
she did.  The case shows that the principal complaints
made by the plaintiff
are that her Worship completely misunderstood the test she was to apply and
further that she misunderstood
the principles applicable as to whether or not
there was a running account between the plaintiff and Cypain at the relevant
time.
<P>

3	Both counsel for the plaintiff (Mr J E Thomson) and the solicitor for the
defendants (Mr S Gallant) agree that the learned Magistrate
completely
misunderstood the applicable law on the first point.  Indeed Mr Gallant submits
that Mr Thomson's submissions to this
Court, which I will set out shortly, are
an admirable exposition as to what the correct principles are.  This is really
no surprise
because both gentlemen put exactly the same submissions to the
learned Magistrate both orally and in writing.   Both submitted that
the Court
must apply the "commercial reality" test mentioned by McGarvie, J in <b>Taylor
v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUConstrLawNlr/1990/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 ACLR 780</a>, 784 and
expounded in more detail by myself in <b>Hamilton v BHP Steel (JLA) Pty Ltd
</b>(1995)<b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=13%20ACLC%201548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">13 ACLC 1548.</a><b>  </b>Her Worship decided to treat the latter
decision as "obiter" and so not binding on her, declined to accept the help
provided to her
by the common submissions of the learned and experienced
lawyers who appeared before her and put up her own test contrary to a
consistent
line of decisions of the High Court, this Court and other Supreme
Courts over the last 40 years.
<P>

4	I have remarked elsewhere that preference claims under $40,000 should be
heard in the local court.  If the present case is anything
to go by, it is
disturbing to see that parties are unable to get a rational decision and are
forced to the expense of having a small
claim entertained in this Court with
all the added expense.  In saying this, I am not denigrating the learned
Magistrate.  A judicial
officer soon learns not to trust every submission of
every lawyer who appears in his or her court.  However after hearing a
sufficient
number of cases, one learns who knows what he or she is talking
about and whose submissions must be treated with suspicion.  I suspect
at least
part of the problem is that the Magistrate did not have a sufficient bulk of
this type of case to know to what extent she
could rely on the advocates and
felt she had to do her own research into a technical and complex area of the
law, which research
miscarried.
<P>

5	The concession that the learned Magistrate applied the wrong test is enough
for me to decide that the Magistrate erred in law
and return the case to her
for determination according to law.
<P>

6	However, both advocates ask me not to sent the case back.  Both say the
primary facts as they were presented to the Magistrate
are not in dispute and
that with one possible exception, there is no question of credibility to be
considered.
<P>

7	Mr Thomson says that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> as amended, especially
sub-section (1)(c), gives the Court wide powers to make such order as it thinks
fit including an order that
the Court itself enter judgment for one or other of
the parties.  
<P>

8	Mr Gallant consents to this Court making a final determination because this
relatively small matter is the last matter to be dealt
with before the
liquidators can apply to have the company dissolved.  The liquidators consider
it in the interests of creditors generally
that that happen sooner rather than
later.
<P>

9	The almost invariable order when a magistrate is wrong on a point of law is
to answer the magistrate's question "Yes" and remit
the matter to be heard
according to law:   <b>Toohey v Taylor </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 743</a>, 751.  However,
there is power for this Court to enter its own judgment being the judgment the
magistrate ought to have entered.
 The only precedent for this type of order
that I have been able to find is <b>Barton v Elliott </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLawRp/1887/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1887] NSWLawRp 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%203%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 3 WN (NSW) 110</a>,
where the Full Court found that the magistrate had completely misunderstood a
plain tenancy case and that the only order that could
be made was that the
landlord have possession and the Court so ordered.
<P>

10	Thus there is power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> to make a final order in
this case.  However, to  minimise the danger of people asking this Ccourt as a
matter of course to do this,
I should state that the Court will probably only
so deal with a case stated in special situations.  The factors that to my mind
make
the present a special situation are that both parties consent,  the matter
is a non-criminal case and the principal question is a
question of law and the
factual matters can be decided by reference to the materials before the Court
without making any findings
as to credit.
<P>

11	I now embark on a consideration of the merits of the matter.  I must note
that I only have to deal with two matters as the remaining
aspects of the case,
including some statutory defences raised by the present plaintiff before the
Magistrate, were rejected by her
and are not the subject of the case stated.
<P>

12	<b>THE PREFERENCE QUESTION</b>
<P>

As I remarked earlier, both advocates agree that Mr Thomson's submissions
correctly state the law on the test for a preference.
 I agree and will now set
out the essentials of those submissions.  This is made easier for me because,
in accordance with modern
practice, Mr Thomson supplied his submissions both on
disk and in hard copy so that they can easily be incorporated into the reasons
that I am myself composing on my computer.
<P>

13	Section 95A(2) of the Corporations Law provides that a person who is not
solvent is insolvent and s 95A(1) provides that a person
is solvent if, and
only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they
become due and payable.
<P>

14	This definition in substance merely restates the applicable test which had
previously applied under s 565 of the Corporations
Law, picking up as it did
the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>, (in its former incarnation).

<P>

15	Thus, <b>Sandell v Porter</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 666</a>, and in particular the
observations of Barwick CJ at 670 continue to be regarded as a correct
description of what must be shown to
prove insolvency.  For example, in Ford's
<b>Principles of Corporations Law </b>(1994, Butterworths, Sydney)  [20.140]
("Proof of Insolvency When the Debt was Incurred") the learned author
states:
<P>

"The s 95A test requires an ascertainment of the company's existing debts, its
debts within the near future, the date each will
be due for payment, the
company's present and expected cash resources and the date each item will be
received. The court's task is
to decide whether the company is suffering from a
temporary lack of liquidity in which case it is not insolvent (<b>Bank of
Australasia v Hall</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] HCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%204%20CLR%201514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 4 CLR 1514</a>;  <b>Sandell v Porter</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115
CLR 666</a>, 670) or an `endemic shortage of working capital':   <b>Hymix Concrete
Pty Limited v Garrity</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2013%20ALR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 13 ALR 321</a>, 328".
<P>

16	The cases decided after the introduction of s 95A and the revised preference
provisions, are to the same effect.  In <b>Downey v Aira Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14
ACLC 1068</a>, 1070-1, Ashley J said:
<P>

"In concluding that Taylor Grace was insolvent at the relevant times I have not
applied the test of solvency set up by s 95A(1)
in an entirely literal and
mechanical way.  It would be wrong to conclude that a company was insolvent on
a given day only because,
on that day or for some short period thereafter, the
company was unable from readily available liquid assets to pay its debts as
and
when they fell due and payable.  Cases decided in the context of the former
Companies Code, which imported <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a> (Cth) remain
pertinent, notwithstanding that the language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(4)(c)(i)</a> somewhat
differed from the present legislation:  see for example the judgment of Barwick
CJ in <b>Sandell v Porter and Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 666</a>, 670, cited by
McGarvie J in <b>Taylor v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited</b>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUConstrLawNlr/1990/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 6 ACLC 808</a>, 810-811.  In <b>Taylor</b> (at 810) McGarvie J described
determination of the issue as a `question of fact to be decided as a matter of
commercial reality in
the light of all the circumstances'.  The concept of
`commercial reality' was explored by Young J in <b>Hamilton v BHP Steel (JLA)
Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%201548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 1548".</a>
<P>

Ashley J quotes with evident approval, passages from Young J's decision in
<b>Hamilton v BHP</b>.
<P>

17	The Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court in <b>Sims v Celcast
Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1998/7140.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] SASC 7140</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2071%20SASR%20142" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 71 SASR 142</a>, 147, stated that "Insolvency is a question of
fact to be decided as a matter of commercial reality in light of all the
circumstances:
 see <b>Taylor v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUConstrLawNlr/1990/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 6 ACLC 808</a></b>."  Williams J (with whom Cox J and Mullighan J agreed)
also set out the passage from Barwick CJ in <b>Sandell v Porter</b> as
clarifying the meaning of "solvent" for the purposes of s 95A of the
Corporations Law.  The "post Harmer" provisions for voidable
transactions were
being applied in that case.
<P>

18	In <b>Melbase Corporation Pty Ltd v Segenhoe</b> <b>Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1225.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1225</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%20823" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC
823</a>, 832, Lindgren J stated:
<P>

"Section 95A of the Law states a `cashflow test' rather than a `balance sheet
test' of insolvency."
<P>

19	Under s 592(1)(b) of the Law, liability could be incurred when there are
reasonable grounds to expect the phrase used is "that
the company will not be
able to pay all its debts as and when they become due".  In <b>Re New World
Alliance Pty Limited (Receiver and Manager Appointed);  Sycotex Pty Ltd v
Baseler </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1117.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1117</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2051%20FCR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 51 FCR 425</a>, 435-6, Gummow J noted:
<P>

"At the trial, a great deal of attention was focused on the level of
indebtedness of New World and whether its liabilities exceeded
its assets.
However, this in itself does not directly answer the issue raised by par (b).
The issue is not dealt with by analysing
a hypothetical instantaneous
liquidation:  see <b>Dunn v Shapowloff</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%202%20NSWLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 2 NSWLR 235</a>,  244 per Mahoney
JA ... If debts are long term, and the company is making profits, it may be
that a company with a substantial indebtedness
could trade its way out of
difficulties.  What is required is an analysis of the assets and financial
resources of the company, and
its likely liabilities and probable dates that
these will fall due, to ascertain whether it is reasonable to expect that one
or more
of these liabilities will not be able to be met." 
<P>

20	Mr Thomson then put that on the facts before the Magistrate, the liquidators
had failed to show that Cypain was insolvent on
a cashflow basis at any of the
relevant dates.  The payments under attack were made between 10 February and 2
June 1995.  Cypain's
balance sheet and profit and loss accounts as at 30 June
1994 or at 31 March 1995 were in evidence.  Mr Thomson puts that on both
the
lastmentioned dates, Cypain's enterprise was a going concern.  He points to the
fact that in the year ended 30 June 1994, Cypain
traded at a profit of $27,780
even after bringing into account non-cash charges including amortisation -
intangibles $12,535 and
depreciation $17,662.  Trade creditors at $265,371 had
not materially increased from the previous year and there was no evidence
to
suggest that they were not able to be paid out of current assets totalling
$445,489.  The bank overdraft and bank loan which were
included in current
liabilities had reduced over that year and although the overdraft was on demand
it was subject to annual review,
the other loans were payable on or before 14
May 1995 and subject to annual review.  The evidence was that all bank
facilities were
in fact refinanced in March/April  1995.  The other liabilities
were to the directors and their family trust who continued to support
the
company.  So, he puts,  the 30 June 1994 accounts certainly failed to establish
that Cypain was insolvent on a cashflow basis.
<P>

21	Then turning to the profit and loss account for the nine months ended 31
March 1995, Mr Thomson submits that although these disclosed
a net loss of
$26,790 which, after allowing for non-cash items amortisation - intangibles
$9,402 and depreciation $10,557, all that
they indicated in commercial terms
was that Cypain required additional cash of $6,831 to fund the trading loss.
The company's bank
loans had been refinanced and $238,000 was now shown as
non-current.  The notes showing the details of the 31 March 1995 summary
accounts were not proved.  Mr Rodgers, one of the liquidators gave evidence
before the Magistrate and, in cross-examination, said
that he did not know
where the notes to the accounts for 31 March 1995 were.  Mr Thomson put that it
is significant that Mr Rodgers
did not suggest they were unavailable.  Mr
Rodgers agreed that the 1993 and 1994 accounts did not show any significant
trading loss
in those two years and that non-cash items and things of that
nature should be ignored for purposes of assessing demands on the company's
cashflow.  Mr Rodgers agreed with counsel that Cypain lost the support of its
previous banker (ANZ) around December/January 1995
and arranged for a
refinancing of those facilities with a new banker prepared to support the
company with banking facilities. He
also agreed that Cypain continued to enjoy
the confidence of its incoming or new banker until close to liquidation.  
<P>

22	Mr Thomson thus puts that the summary accounts of 31 March 1995, without the
accompanying notes do not prove that Cypain was
insolvent on a cashflow basis
on 31 March 1995.
<P>

23	Mr Gallant puts a different view of the accounts. He says that as at 30 June
1994, Cypain had accumulated losses of $138,102.
 Its sales had fallen by 8%
compared with the previous financial year.  Its turnover and consequently its
business, had suffered
a downturn.  If one compares the current assets with
current liabilities, it is clear that 61% of current assets was constituted
by
stock. The evidence of Mrs Morton, the plaintiff's executive director was that
when she spoke to Cypain's accountant on 30 March
1995, he remarked that part
of the problem was high stock levels creating cashflow difficulties.  Mr
Gallant puts that the commercial
reality of the situation was that, as at 30
June 1994, the company would have had to liquidate all its stock to meet its
current
liabilities, which it could not do.  
<P>

24	Then Mr Gallant says that, having established that Cypain was insolvent as
of 30 June 1994, the defendants can rely on the presumption
in s 588E(3) of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

25	Alternatively, the accounts of 31 March 1995 show a loss for the period, a
further reduction in sales, a reduction in stock levels
and a reduction in
receivables disclosing an effort to collect trade debts.  Although there had
been refinancing, the figures show
a decline in Cypain's position and
demonstrate that it was unable to meet its debts as and when they fell due.
<P>

26	It is clear that Cypain was not in the best of financial health at the
relevant time.  It is also important to remember that
the onus is on the
liquidators to demonstrate insolvency.  With this background, the question I
need to decide is whether that evidence
of unhealthiness was merely a temporary
lack of liquidity (in which case it is not to be classed as insolvent) or an
"endemic shortage
of working capital" which would indicate insolvency.
<P>

27	In addition to the factors to which the advocates have directed my
attention, the evidence before the learned Magistrate shows
that no goods were
supplied by the plaintiff to Cypain between 16 March 1995 and 2 June 1995
despite orders being placed.  Orders
were only met after Cypain little by
little reduced its accumulated time of indebtedness to below 30 days.
Ordinarily, the plaintiff
was tolerant of debtors up to 45-60 days.  Again,
when Mrs Morton spoke to Cypain's accountant as set out earlier, the accountant
informed her that, "No one is owed for amounts further back than December
1994".  This at least means that there were some creditors
whose debts were at
least three months old.  However, Cypain's former bank had withdrawn its
support in December 1994/January 1995
and the new financial arrangements were
not finally put into place until,  it would seem, the first week of April 1995.
This would
blunt the signifiance of some creditors having to wait 100 days for
payment instead of the usual trade terms of 30-60 days.  Again
Mr Rodgers
conceded that it would appear that the cashflow position was about line ball
between June 1994 and March 1995.  In this
period, as I have already remarked,
there  had been no material increase in the level of trade creditors.
<P>

28	Further, there was evidence which was not contradicted that in the packaging
trade, particularly in Canberra where Cypain was
based, there is a considerable
slow period during Christmas/January.
<P>

29	Although the case is close to the borderline, my view of the evidence is
that by February 1995 Cypain was in greater financial
trouble than mere
cashflow.   Even in mid 1994, the basic position was that Cypain had
accumulated losses and its principal current
asset was its stock.   Stock
levels had remained high and constant from 30 June 1993.  It had trade
creditors of $265,000 and the
only current funds to pay them could come from
receivables and from bank funding.  The business was obviously falling off
after 30
June 1994 and the only way it was being kept afloat was by a further
bank loan supported by injection of funds from the directors'
superannuation
accounts.   The problems were exacerbated by the refinancing needed in early
1995 and Cypain got further and further
behind with its payments to the
plaintiff and by March that year had trade debts of 100 days old.  Its asset
position was deteriorating
at least slightly, its turnover was down and it was
still making losses.  By February 1995 it was insolvent.
<P>

30	I thus need to turn to the question as to whether there was a running
account.
<P>

31	<b>THE "RUNNING ACCOUNT" ISSUE</b>
<P>

	This matter is significant because in fact the evidence showed that between 10
February 1995 and the commencement of the insolvent
administration (the period
over which the payments totalling $32,933.52 claimed by the liquidators were
made), the plaintiff supplied
further goods on credit totalling $27,950.  Thus,
any preference affected through the running account, was less than $5,000.
<P>

32	Section 588FA(3) of the Corporations Law is a statutory embodiment of what
was formerly referred to as "the running account doctrine":
 <b>Olifent v
Australian Wine Industries Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 510</a>, 517.
<P>

33	The evidence before the learned Magistrate was that the transactions which
led to the payments being made by Cypain were all
of a similar type, were all
on the one account and were all part of a continuing business relationship.
<P>

34	In <b>Airservices Australia v Ferrier</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20185%20CLR%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 185 CLR 483</a>, 504-6, the
majority in the High Court confirmed that "The essential feature of a running
account is that it predicates a continuing
relationship with debtor and
creditor with an expectation that further debts and credits will be recorded.
Ordinarily, a payment,
although often matching an earlier debit, is credited
against the balance owing in the account."  The majority adopted the approach
taken by Barwick CJ in <b>Queensland Bacon Pty Limited v Rees </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20266" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115
CLR 266</a>, 283-6.
<P>

35	The operation of the running account principle was reviewed by the Court of
Appeal in <b>Panasonic Australia Pty Limited v Wily</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLC 613.</a>  Mr
Thomson puts that this is in accordance with the principles for which the
plaintiff contends in the instant case.   Sheller JA
in the <b>Panasonic case
</b>at 616-8 explained the underlying purpose of the rule saying:
<P>

	"To the extent that the payments received between these dates reduced this
debt, they had the effect of giving Panasonic a preference
priority or
advantage over Mistmorn's other creditors.  By contrast, to the extent to which
the payments were received to maintain
the supply of goods in the course of
continuing the business, they did not have the effect of giving Panasonic a
preference.  That
this is so is demonstrated by the High Court's parable in
<b>Richardson v The Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Limited </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1952/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1952] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%2085%20CLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 85 CLR
110</a>, 133 that:
<P>

	`a running account of any debtor who has reached insolvency must present
difficulties under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s95.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 95</a> [the equivalent of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122].</a>  A debtor who pays something
off his grocer's account in order to induce the shopkeeper to give him further
supplies of groceries
can hardly be held, as it seems to us, to give the grocer
a preference, if that was the clear basis of the payment.  If the grocer
credited the money as a payment for the future deliveries instead of the past
deliveries of groceries he would in the end be in exactly
the same position and
yet he could not be attacked as having received a preference.'"
<P>

36	In <b>Airservices Australia v Ferrier</b> (supra) at 503-4, Dawson, Gaudron
and McHugh JJ emphasised that in assessing alleged preferences through a
running account, the Court
looks beyond the immediate effect of payment as a
reduction of past indebtedness:
<P>

	"Like the case of the wider transaction, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122</a> does not require the court to
look at the immediate effect of a particular payment if `the payment formed an
integral step in a unified
course' (<b>Rees v Bank of New South Wales</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20111%20CLR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 111 CLR 210</a>, 222) of dealings between the parties.  The court looks to
the business effect of the parties' dealings which almost invariably proceed
on
the understanding, sometimes expressed but more often assumed, that the
creditor will continue to supply goods or services to
the debtor on a credit
basis as long as the debtor substantially adheres to their credit
arrangements.
<P>

	"If at the end of a series of dealings, the creditor has supplied goods to a
greater value than the payments made to it during
that period, the general body
of creditors are not disadvantaged by the transaction - they may even be better
off.  The supplying
creditor, therefore, has received no preference (see, eg,
<b>CSR Ltd v Starkey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13 ACSR 321</a>, 324).  Consequently, a debtor does
not prefer a creditor merely because it makes irregular payments under an
express or tacit arrangement
with the creditor that, while the debtor makes
payments, the creditor will continue to supply goods (<b>Re Weiss</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20ALR%20654" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970]
Arg LR 654</a>;  <b>CSR Ltd v Starkey </b>(supra)).   In such a situation, the
court does not regard the individual payments as preferences even though they
were unrelated
to any specific delivery of goods or services and may ultimately
have had the effect of reducing the amount of indebtedness of the
debtor at the
beginning of the six-month period (<b>Re Weiss</b> at 659-661)".
<P>

37	Mr Thomson also relied on the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in
<b>Sands &amp; McDougall Wholesale Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Commissioner of Taxation
</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/1998/76.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] VSCA 76</a>, which concluded at [43] with the definition that "a
continuing business relationship involving a running account would ordinarily
be expected to involve at least two parties linked by contract, one supplying
goods or services to the other on a credit basis, the
other paying on a
continuing basis, both to extinguish past liability and to ensure continuance
of supply."
<P>

38	Mr Thomson puts that the commercial arrangements between Julzar and Cypain
as disclosed on the uncontested evidence and accepted
by the learned
Magistrate, had precisely those characteristics.  He puts that there was
uncontested evidence from Mr Murphy, the
plaintiff's NSW Manager, that Cypain
was a customer of the plaintiff from about January 1990 until June 1995.
Throughout that period,
the plaintiff afforded credit to Cypain upon the basis
that Cypain maintained its account in order and that if the account exceeded
45
days in arrears, supply of product would be withheld until the then outstanding
account or accounts had been paid.  This occurred
on several occasions during
the trading relationship followed by a resumption of supply once the necessary
payments had been made.
The course of dealings demonstrates that the
long-standing commercial relationship was continued through the relation back
period,
and involved a mutual assumption of further supply on credit under the
credit terms arrangements.  That is demonstrated by the resumption
of supply on
2 June 1995, the same day Cypain brought its account within the plaintiff's
credit terms.
<P>

39	Mr Thompson then puts that the liquidators' submission (which the learned
Magistrate accepted) that business arrangements cannot
constitute a running
account if they involve the suspension of supply on credit until the account is
brought back to order, cannot
be correct.  That is the very situation which the
High Court's parable about the grocer identifies.  The payment of the account
is
necessary to induce the grocer to allow further supply on credit.  The very
basis of their commercial relationship is that until
the payment is made
further supplies will not be released.  
<P>

40	Mr Gallant does not disagree with the most part of Mr Thomson's exposition
of the law which I have summarized above.  However,
he says -
<P>

	(1) 	In the present case there has not been continuity of payments and supply
as required by the authorities;
<P>

	(2)  	The learned Magistrate found as a fact that there was no ongoing
business relationship at the relevant time;
<P>

	(3)   	There was no intention shown in the plaintiff to continue supply during
the relevant period (vide <b>CSR Ltd v Starkey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13 ACSR 321</a>, 324);
<P>

	(4)  	In any event, apart from the payment of $7,310.49 on 10 February, 1995,
there was no supply of goods for the period of 3
April to 2 June, 1995 when all
the remaining payments attacked as a preference were made.
<P>

41	In my view I should accept most of the defendants' submissions.  It would
have been preferable for the learned Magistrate to
have set out in the stated
case that she had found that there was no ongoing business relationship at the
relevant time.  However,
the passage at page 10 of her judgment, page 228 of
the case makes it clear that she did so.   She set out the present defendants'
submission that she should accept Mrs Morton's evidence as showing clearly that
the present plaintiff's attitude towards Cypain was
that there was no ongoing
business relationship until Cypain's account was brought within terms, that is
that all moneys owing were
paid. Thus there was not the factual basis for a
running account from at the latest 1 April 1995 as there was not the "intention
of continuing supplying the company on credit" (<b>CSR v Starkey</b> (supra) at
p 324).
<P>

42	However, when one examines the evidence of Mrs Morton, it can be seen that
the plaintiff only changed its attitude to Cypain
after the bounced cheque
episode and her conversation with Cypain's accountant on 30 March 1995.  Up
until then, the dealings between
the parties have all the indicia of a running
account;  the fact that supply is withheld until the account is brought within
trading
terms does not affect the relationship until the point is reached, as
it was by 30 March 1995, that everything must be paid before
any further supply
is made and an appreciable period elapses before supply is resumed.
<P>

43	The result is that this defence reduces the amount of the liquidators'
verdict by $7,310.49.
<P>

44	Thus the Magistrate's question should be answered, "Yes".   She should also
be advised that she should, in the light of these
reasons and by consent of the
parties, amend her judgment for the present defendants to $25,623.03 plus the
appropriate amount of
interest and costs.
<P>

45	I will stand the matter over for short minutes to be brought in by the
plaintiff.   Those short minutes will need to be carefully
framed in view of
the fact that what is happening here is that the decision on the merits is a
matter of record in the local court.
 As to costs, I would have thought that
the costs of the first trial would have abided the result of reconsideration by
the Magistrate
after the case was returned to her. Because of the procedure I
have adopted the notional retrial favoured the present defendants
so that the
original order for costs made by the Magistrate should stand.  As the plaintiff
has succeeded on the only legitimate
question before the court, that is whether
the Magistrate erred, it should not pay any costs of the appeal.  However, as
the plaintiff
was only slightly successful on the merits, my present view is
that each party should bear its own costs of the appeal. I have not
yet heard
counsel on this matter.  Either party may argue the correctness of my
preliminary view when the short minutes are brought
in without being thought to
be guilty of disrespect to the Court.
<P>

46	I will formally stand the matter over to 31 March, 1999 at 9:50am for the
purpose of dealing with draft short minutes of order.
 If that time is
inconvenient to the advocates, they may, at least the week before, arrange a
substitute day with my Associate.
<P>
