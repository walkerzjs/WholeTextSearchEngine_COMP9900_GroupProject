WEDNESDAY 16 JUNE 1999
<P>

<u>21244/1995</u>	<u>BRIAN PATRICK O'DWYER v THE COMMONWEALTH </u>
<P>

<u>OF AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This proceeding is one of the many arising out of the collision
between the HMAS Melbourne and the HMAS Voyager on 10 February
1964.  The
process was filed on 29 November 1995.  An Amended Defence was filed in Court
on 9 June 1999.  It admits certain of the
alleged particulars of negligence.
It pleads a defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63</a> (1) of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a></u> (the
Act).
<P>

2  	Previously, on 6 December 1995, the Plaintiff had filed a Notice
of Motion seeking an extension of the relevant limitation period.
 This
application came on for hearing on 9 June 1999.  The application was
opposed.
<P>

3  	The evidence placed before the Court fell within a small compass.
The plaintiff has sworn three affidavits.  Exhibits to the
affidavits were
tendered.  There was some short cross-examination of the plaintiff.  The
defendant did not adduce any evidence.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff was born on 7 August 1936.  He became a member of
the Royal Australian Navy on 23 October 1958.  At the time of
the collision he
was a member of the crew of HMAS Melbourne.  He was on the flight deck at the
time.  Paragraph 6 of the affidavit
sworn on 12 November 1998 provides a
version of what he observed at the time of and following the collision.  He was
not cross-examined
on this version.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff has said that his life changed after the collision
and that he was a different man.  He has suffered from various
symptoms since
the collision and his condition has remained much the same.
<P>

6  	He was discharged from the Navy on 22 October 1970.  Thereafter,
an unhappy personal history ensued.  For the purposes of dealing
with this
application, it is unnecessary to recite the details of that history.  The
material can be gleaned from the affidavits.
<P>

7  	In 1995 he responded to an advertisement placed by his now
solicitor.  He first saw a solicitor (which was his present solicitor)
in about
September 1995.  The instructions given by him led to the bringing of these
proceedings.  He was referred to Dr Wu.  The
late Dr Wu was a consultant
psychiatrist.  He provided a report dated 25 February 1996.  It was following
his consultation with Dr
Wu that he first became aware that he was suffering
from acute stress disorder/adjustment disorder.  Prior to that time, he was
unaware
that he had been suffering from a medical condition.
<P>

8  	Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the Act.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a>
prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> unless the Court is satisfied of
the matters listed in (a) and (b) of subsection (1) thereof.  These are
threshold requirements to
the making of an order.  When the threshold
requirements have been satisfied, there is a discretionary power to grant
relief.
<P>

9  	The submissions made on behalf of the parties were brief.  The
defendant contended that the threshold requirements had not been
met.  It was
submitted that none of the matters listed in paragraph (a) (i) - (iii) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a>
(1) had been made out by the evidence.  Further, it was said that the
discretion should not be exercised in favour of the plaintiff.
 Broadly
speaking, it was said that he had constructive knowledge and should have
earlier found out about his medical condition (reference
was made to <u>Harris
v Commercial Minerals Ltd</u> (3 April 1996)).
<P>

10  	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the relevant threshold
requirements.  Similar considerations have been addressed
in previous cases
(including <u>Darcy v The Commonwealth of Australia</u> (25 July 1997) and
<u>Burns v The Commonwealth of Australia</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/223.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 223).</a>  It suffices to
specifically mention that I am satisfied that the requirement appearing in (a)
(ii) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1) has been met.  I am satisfied that, despite his knowledge as
to symptoms, he was unaware that he had a serious psychiatric condition
prior
to seeing Dr Wu (see inter alia <u>Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56 FCR 389).</a>  In these circumstances, it is not necessary to consider
submissions made in respect of (i) and (iii) thereof.  Further, I am satisfied
that this application has been made within the 3 year period prescribed by (1)
(b).
<P>

11  	I am not satisfied that the discretionary consideration agitated
by the defendant has been sustained.  I should add that had
it been sustained
it did not seem to me to be of such weight (in the circumstances of this case)
as to lead the Court to a rejection
of the application.
<P>

12  	The onus rests with the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that he
has an entitlement to relief.  In the relevant circumstances
of this case, I am
satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

13  	I have reached the decision that it is just and reasonable to
make the order sought and that such an order should be made in
this case.
<P>

14  	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded
in the Statement of Claim up to and including 29 November 1995.
 I reserve the
question of costs.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
