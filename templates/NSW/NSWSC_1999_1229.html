<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  This is an application, by Notice of
Motion, by one Stephen Morris, to be joined as a party under Pt8r8 of the
<i>Rules of the Supreme Court</i>, to proceedings commenced by Ms Courtney
Fraser for review of the decision of the President of the Anti-discrimination
Board, declining
to extend time under s88(4) of the <i>Anti-Discrimination
Act</i> 1997 (the Act), to a complaint made by Ms Fraser.  The proceedings for
review instituted by Ms Fraser name as respondents the President
of the
Anti-discrimination Board and the University of Sydney. The University was, at
the relevant time, Dr Morris' employer and
is hence necessarily a respondent in
the Board proceedings and, accordingly, the review and this application.
<P>

2   	By combination of s31A and s53 of the Act, together with
perhaps, the principles of the general law relating to ancillary liability
for
unlawful acts, it is obvious from the material tendered before me, that
although complaints are made by Ms Fraser, in respect
to the behaviour of a
number of the University's employees, her principal allegations concern the
applicant in this proceeding. 
These allegations are extremely serious and
involve moral and professional culpability of a grave order.  Her complaint to
the Anti-discrimination
Board was, however, made out of time.  When the
President declined to extend time, the effect, so far as the University was
concerned,
was that the matter was at an end. In a subsidiary sense, this was
also true of the applicant. To use neutral language, I hope, the
applicant had
a great deal at stake in relation to the complaint and its investigation, or
otherwise. Adverse findings against him
could be extremely injurious to his
reputation and have other substantial consequences.  The extent to which those
consequences may
be visited on him, by virtue of any particular provisions of
the ADA, is perhaps uncertain, although it is the subject of debate
before me.
It was submitted for Ms Fraser, however, that he was not a party to the Board
proceedings and was rightly, indeed, necessarily
omitted from the review
proceedings and thus should fail in this application.
<P>

3   	I am far from satisfied that there is no risk that the
applicant might be subjected to an adverse decision, should the matter
proceed
to be heard by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/adta1997348/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act</i> 1997</a> (ADTA).  It might be that he,
if he were not by then formally a party to the proceedings, would be made a
party to them pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/adta1997348/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s67</a> of that Act, which requires a person to be a
party  "if the Tribunal is satisfied that the interests of the person are
likely to
be affected by the ... decision": s67(4).
<P>

4   	These proceedings, however, do not directly concern the
interpretation of s67 of ADTA, although the argument that if the matter
got so
far, the Tribunal would be so satisfied, strikes me as being a strong one.
However, for present purposes, I need say no more
about this aspect of the
case.  It is clear that he might well be such a party.
<P>

5   	The crucial provisions, as I mentioned at the outset, are
the terms of Pt8 r8(1)(a) and (b) of the Rules, which relevantly
state -
<P>

"(1)	Where a person who is not a party -
<P>

(a)	ought to have been joined as a party;  or
<P>

(b)	is a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all
matters in dispute in the proceedings may be ineffectual
and completely
determined and adjudicated upon the Court, on application by him, or by any
party, or of its own motion, may order
that he be added as a party and make
orders for the further conduct of the proceedings."
<P>

Were the matter simply to be determined on the material which I have thus far
mentioned, I think that I must refuse the application
for joinder.  However,
s52 of the Act states -
<P>

"It is unlawful for a person to cause, instruct, induce, aid or permit another
person to do an act that is unlawful by reason of
a provision of this Act"
<P>

The view of the President, as notified to the applicant here, is that Ms Fraser
had not only alleged discrimination on the ground
of sex, in the area of
education, against the University of Sydney but also -
<P>

" ... made a complaint against you, as an individual, on the basis that she
alleges that you aided and abetted the University of
Sydney to discriminate
against her ... because she states that you sexually harassed her and subjected
her to sexist and demeaning
comments and behaviour ... in 1996".
<P>

Ms Fraser's complaint has been tendered and it comprises, amongst other things,
a lengthy narrative alleging serious misbehaviour
by the applicant directed to
her.  Although, in terms, it does not allege an aiding and abetting, in
substance, such an allegation
is raised in the complaint and I consider that
the President has rightly considered that this is so and appropriately informed
the
applicant of his interest in the matter.
<P>

6   	If the present position were to subsist, the applicant is
freed from involvement in proceedings in which he is, in substance,
a
respondent and indeed, was formally identified as such by Ms Fraser's own
complaint.  
<P>

7   	Ms Winters, appearing here for Ms Fraser, and whose
submissions I have found very helpful, suggested that the terms of the
complaint naming the applicant should not be given any weight, since it was the
mere expression of a  layperson's understanding of
the position.  Even so, Ms
Fraser has been legally represented throughout and there was no hint before me
that she would not seek
to maintain the position, apparently expressed in the
documents under her hand, to which I have referred and which have engendered
both the proceedings before the President and in this Court.
<P>

8   	It is obvious, from what I have said, that the interests of
the applicant and that of the President, are not identical.  The
University has
entered a submitting appearance, both to this and the substantive application
for review of the President's decision.
 The President has taken the same
course in relation to this proceeding but I am informed proposes to defend the
substantive application.
<P>

9   	There is much to be said for the argument that the
applicant should have been joined as a party in the review proceedings under
Pt8r8(1)(a), in light of his identification in the Board proceedings as a
person aiding and abetting the employer.  Ms Winters points
out, however, that
there is some doubt, in the circumstances alleged here, whether an employee,
such as the applicant, could be an
aider and abetter, by virtue of s52 of the
Act.  However, I am of the view that there might well be liability under that
provision,
quite apart from the general law, and that the applicant must have
the opportunity to resist the applicant's claim, which presently
subsists, that
he has a personal responsibility under the Act as being both implicitly (so far
as the complaint is concerned) and
explicitly (as the President alleged) an
aider and abetter of the University's behaviour.
<P>

10   	Even if, however, Pt8r9(1)(a) does not apply, I have no
doubt that the applicant's joinder as a party, is necessary for the
purposes
set out in r8(1)(b).  Indeed, having regard to the present state of the
proceedings, I consider that to exclude the applicant
from the proceedings,
would be to subject him to grave injustice, as he, to my mind, has a direct and
not merely an indirect interest,
in their outcome.
<P>

11   	Accordingly, although I have wavered somewhat during the
helpful debate of counsel, I have concluded that this application
must be
granted.
<P>

12   	I order costs, in favour of the applicant, against
Courtney Jane Fraser, in respect of the Notice of Motion.
<P>
