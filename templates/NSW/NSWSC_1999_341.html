<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  This is the second part of proceedings under which the plaintiff
claims to be entitled to benefits under the Telecom
Superannuation Scheme
because, she says, that she ceased to be an employee of what is now Telstra as
a result of total and permanent
invalidity, her employment having come to an
end on 13 September 1991.  It came to an end pursuant to a statutory regime
under which
she was required to attend work and failed to do so and as a result
of that after a time her employment was deemed to have come to
an end.
<P>

2	It is accepted that the amended summons which was filed 7 November 1997 is
inappropriate because it seeks a declaration that the
plaintiff ceased to be an
employee of her employer through total and permanent disability within the
meaning of the Scheme rules,
and secondly, seeks an order for payment of the
amount which the plaintiff would be entitled to if she was entitled to a
payment
because of total and permanent invalidity.
<P>

3	These proceedings came on for hearing in the first place before Mr Justice
Young on 17 August 1998 when he drew attention to this
and it was accepted that
at least in this case the appropriate relief was, if any were granted, that the
matter be sent back to the
Trustee for a proper determination.  He came to the
conclusion on the material before him that the defendant Trustee failed to deal
with the plaintiff's claim for benefits fairly and adequately as it was
required to do and, therefore, he ordered that the defendant
properly consider
the plaintiff's claim and present a report to the Court as to its
consideration.  That has now been done and the
matter is back before the
Court.
<P>

4	It is therefore accepted that a further amended summons is to be filed under
which the plaintiff will seek an order that the matter
be referred back again
to the Trustee to make a proper determination as required by it under the Fund
rules.  The matter has therefore
proceeded on the basis that an amended summons
will be filed and it will be necessary for me to make an order that that be
done by
not later than Monday next.
<P>

5	The defendant has reported to the Court and there is evidence now of the
material which was taken into account by the directors
of the defendant Trustee
when they made their decision on 25 November 1998 and rejected the claim of the
plaintiff for benefits.
 That material, amongst other things, included reports
of at least sixteen doctors some of whom gave two reports.  In the cases where
two reports were given it could be said in general that the first report was
given in connection with the claim under the Compensation
Commonwealth and
Government Employees Act 1971 or its successor the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ceraca1988534/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Employees
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988</a>.  
<P>

6	As was pointed out by Mr Justice Young in his earlier judgment entitlement
under that Act required that the injury, or if you
like, the disability arose
as a result of or in the course of the work the plaintiff was employed to do,
whereas an entirely different
consideration would arise under the provisions of
the Superannuation Scheme.
<P>

7	Under cl 2.3.3 of the Trust Deed for the Telecom Superannuation Scheme in
force at the time in question it is provided as follows:
<P>

Subject to Pt 2.4 if a member ceases to be an employee before attaining the age
of sixty years because of total and permanent invalidity
there is payable to
the member from the Fund a lump sum benefit of an amount equal to the benefit
which would have been payable under
cl 2.3.2 if the member had died on the date
of invalidity."
<P>

8	Total invalidity is defined under the rules as follows:
<P>

Total and permanent invalidity means in relation to a member disablement as a
result of which
<P>

(a)	Unless otherwise agreed between the Trustee and the principal employer from
time to time either generally or in any particular
case the member has been
continuously absent from all active work for a period of at least six months
and had been required by the
employer to participate in a rehabilitation
programme and
<P>

(b)	In the opinion of the Trustee after consideration of any information
evidence and advice provided to the Trustees by the employer
and any  other
information evidence and advice the Trustee may consider relevant the member
has ceased to be an employee and is unlikely
ever to engage in any gainful work
for which the member is for the time being reasonably qualified by education,
training or experience.
<P>

9	There follows certain exclusions relating to what might be described as
invalidity caused through a deliberate act or inaction
of the claiming person.

<P>

10	Counsel for the plaintiff says that the Trustee must form the opinion as at
the date it makes its determination, in this case
namely November 1998, as to
whether the claimant is unlikely ever to engage in any gainful work, and if the
answer to that question
is in the affirmative whether that state of being
unable to engage in any gainful work was the reason the member ceased to be an
employee, in this case, in 1991.   In other words what is said is that the
position as to invalidity must be looked at at the time
the decision is made
and not at the time of ceasing to work. 
<P>

11	Counsel for the defendant says that the relevant date is the date of ceasing
work but that what has happened since then is relevant
and ought to be taken
into account because if the member had gone back to work that is obviously a
relevant matter and if the member
has not gone back to work then that is
evidence which might bear upon the question of whether the member was totally
and permanently
incapacitated from work at the date when work ceased. 
<P>

12	I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to look at the 1991 date
and to establish cessation of employment because
of total invalidity as at that
date, because if that were not so sense could not be given to the requirements
of 2.2.3.  Counsel
for the plaintiff says that the Trustee through its
directors did not consider the appropriate question and therefore did not give
real, genuine and fair consideration to the claim of the plaintiff which the
Trustee was required to do.  He goes on to say that
because there is no
evidence from any director of the Trustee company and therefore there was no
opportunity to cross-examine any
Trustee, and because the Trustee itself has
chosen not to give reasons for its decision then one must look carefully at the
matters
now before the Court to determine whether or not the decision of the
Trustee was based on a fair consideration of the evidence before
it and the
matters it was required to take into account under the rules. 
<P>

13	I have some difficulty with the criticism, if it were that, levied at the
defendant for not giving affidavit evidence through
one of its directors
thereby subjecting that director to cross-examination.  This argument, as I
understand it, was that questions
in cross-examination could be directed
towards establishing the reasons for the decision.  It is accepted the Trustee
is not bound
to give such reasons and thus it does not seem to me that
criticism is really fairly based.  What the plaintiff must establish to
make
out her claim for relief is that the decision of the trustee to reject her
claim was a decision that no reasonable person could
come to on the evidence
available to it.  It is not the function of the Court to decide whether a
particular decision might or might
not have been more reasonable in its view
than the decision to which the Trustees have come.  If that were the position
then the
discretion of the Trustees, or the decision of the Trustees, would be
of little significance because the Court would always be able
to replace that
decision with its own decision and that is clearly not the requirement under
the rules nor the position in law. 

<P>

14	What is required is a proper consideration of the claim of the member under
the Scheme rules and a fair determination of that
question.  If upon the
material before the Trustee a decision is come to which no reasonable person
could have come to then the Court
can declare that to be the position and send
the matter back for proper determination by the Trustees in accordance with its
duties
under the rules.  If there is some continuing failure to consider the
matter properly then it would be my view under normal circumstances
that the
appropriate course would have to be for proceedings to be brought for removal
of the Trustee so that a new Trustee could
be put in place so that the members,
being the beneficiaries under the Deed and Rules, would obtain what they are
entitled to obtain,
namely a proper consideration of their claims for benefits
under the Scheme. 
<P>

15	The question then for consideration is whether or not the Trustee fulfilled
its obligation under the Scheme or, more properly,
whether it has been shown
that it did not.  In my opinion that has not been shown.  First, I do not think
it has been shown that
the Trustee addressed the wrong question or that it
asked its medical advisers the wrong questions.  Second, I do not think it has
been shown that the decision to reject the plaintiff's claim was a decision
which no reasonable person on a proper consideration
of the materials could
have come to.   
<P>

16	The Trustee took two steps:  first, it obtained some new medical reports,
first, from Prof Muirdin, a rheumatologist and, from
Dr Gibney who is a
consultant psychiatrist, these reports being obtained for the purposes of its
reconsideration and second, so far
as was possible, it obtained new reports
from those doctors who had earlier made reports in connection with the
compensation proceedings.
 Most of those doctors were available and provided
new reports. 
<P>

17	In such cases the Trustee wrote to the relevant doctor stating why the
information was required, namely, to assess issues relating
to total and
permanent invalidity, gave details of the plaintiff's educational level and
employment history which may have had one
mistake but in general could not be
challenged, and then asked certain questions as to the diagnosis of the
plaintiff's condition
as at 13 September 1991; the effect of her condition on
her work capacity at that time and her prognosis for a full or partial
recovery;
whether as at that date the plaintiff was able to perform any work;
and if not the probability of her subsequently engaging in gainful
work and, if
so, what type of work would be suitable. 
<P>

18	It is relevant to point out, in fairness to the plaintiff, that a number of
these doctors had never considered that the plaintiff
was suffering from any
disability which prevented her from engaging in work.  As I understand the
position that finding had nothing
to do with some work-related injury but,
rather, a finding that there was no disability in any event.  Thus while Dr
Scarfe considered
that the plaintiff had no physical condition and it would
appear from his report no condition which would prevent her from engaging
in
any work and that opinion was given in response to her claim that she had
sustained a repetitive strain injury at work, his opinion
of the plaintiff's
physical condition was not restricted to some result from a work injury.  In
those circumstances he reiterated
the same view in his later report of 21
October 1998, that view being that there was no objective, organically based
acceptable diagnosis
for the symptoms she described.  In the same way Dr
Dyball, who is a specialist psychiatrist who examined the plaintiff in December
1991, considered that she had no psychiatric illness and reiterated that view
in his report of 12 October 1998.  In other words he
said she had no
psychiatric disorder so she had nothing to recover from.  Much the same thing
is said but in a much longer form by
 Dr Bell.   The trustee, after
consideration could have accepted the opinions of these doctors.
<P>

19	As against that type of material there was material available and before the
Trustees of the plaintiff's two treating doctors
and there was other material,
for example, from Dr Champion, that he would prefer the view of the treating
doctors to those who had
given opinions only for medico-legal purposes.  The
two treating doctors, Dr Guirgis and Dr Samad, both at the earlier stage and
both now consider that the plaintiff had and has a genuine disability.  Dr
Samad considers this a depressive reaction, resulting
from repetitive strain
injury which Dr Guirgis accepted was an injury which the plaintiff had or a
disability which the plaintiff
had in 1991 which required her to cease work.

<P>

20	There was thus material before the Trustee and its directors (which included
the report of Dr. Gibney) on which they could have
found that the plaintiff had
established an entitlement to the total and permanent disability benefit under
the Fund. There was also
material before the Trustees on which it was possible
for them to find that that was not the position.  In my view it could not be
said that in so finding they came to a decision which was not open to them on
the evidence before them or that they considered the
wrong question.  In
essence they found that the plaintiff was not disabled from work as a result of
a disability.  There was evidence
that work was available to her in 1991 and
that she had been asked to go back to do work and had refused to do so.  Thus
there could
be no question that full time work was not available if there was
an ability to perform that work. 
<P>

21	As I have said the Court cannot substitute its view for the view of the
Trustee.  What it must do is determine whether the plaintiff
has shown that the
Trustee addressed the wrong question or in addressing the right question came
to a conclusion which no reasonable
person could have come to on the material
which was before it.  It might also be possible for the plaintiff to succeed if
it were
shown that the Trustee had made its decision without having sufficient
material before it to enable its decision to be made.  None
of these matters
have been made out and in those circumstances the summons should be dismissed.

<P>

22	I give leave to the plaintiff to file a further amended summons seeking that
the plaintiff's claim for benefits under the Telecom
Superannuation Scheme be
referred back to the Trustee for proper determination.  I order that the
amendment be deemed to have been
made.  I order the plaintiff to file the
further amended summons by 4 p.m. on Monday 12 April 1999 in accordance with
the leave given.
 I order the plaintiff's claim be dismissed.
<P>

	  (Submissions on costs.)
<P>

23	I order that the costs involved in making the determination of 25 November
1998 be paid out of the general Fund which costs include
the fees for the
medical reports submitted by the plaintiff.  I order the defendant's costs of
these proceedings since 17 August
1998 (being those separate from the costs
involved in the Trustee's determination) be paid by the plaintiff.   
<P>

24	I propose to order in addition that the material exhibited to the affidavit
of Mr Stevens be marked as an exhibit.  The whole
of the material exhibited to
the affidavit of Mr Stevens sworn 8 February 1999 will be marked Exhibit DX3 on
the proceedings.  I
order that the exhibits be returned but be available for
return to the Court if required.
