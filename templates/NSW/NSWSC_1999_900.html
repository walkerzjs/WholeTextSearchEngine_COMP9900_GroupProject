SMITH LAVENDER
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER: This is the hearing of a case under the Family Provisions
Act in relief of the estate of the late Janet Smith Lavender
who died on 3 July
1997 aged 91 years.  She was survived by her niece, the plaintiff. Her husband
and her only child pre deceased
her.
<P>

2  	The will of which the defendant was granted Probate, was made on
27 July 1994. By that will, she gave to a friend, Margaret
Kidson, some
furniture, gave to the plaintiff a legacy of $5,000 and the North Haven
Retirement Village Control Board of Management
a legacy  of $25,000.  The
balance of her Estate was divided between the Royal New South Wales Society for
Deaf and Blind Children
and the Salvation Army.
<P>

3  	The deceased had made a number of wills over a period of time and
it is useful noting the benefits that the plaintiff received
under those wills.
In 1997 the plaintiff received a legacy of $3,000 and some interest in income.
In 1991 she received a legacy of
$80,000 and an interest in income.  In 1982
and 1984 she received an interest in income in $100,000 if certain events
eventuated.
In 1987 she also received a legacy of $10,000.
<P>

4  	In 1989 she received an income interest in $50,000 and a legacy
of $10,000 and in 1993, she received one half of the residue
of the Estate.
There was thus a substantial restructure between the 1993 will and the 1994
will in respect of which Probate was granted.
<P>

5  	The Estate is a fairly large one.  The net distributable amount
is in the order of $857,000. There are costs in this application
on the defence
side of $18,957 and for the plaintiff of some $17,000. It is necessary to deal
with the history of the family in order
to understand the plaintiff's claim.
<P>

6  	In 1904 Janet Ferguson, the mother of the plaintiff was born.
Her sister, Jane Ferguson, the testator, was born in 1906 thus
the plaintiff is
the niece of the testator.
<P>

7  	In 1923 Thomas Ferguson, the grandfather of the plaintiff and
father of the testator, purchased a house at 9 Julia Street, Ashfield.
 That
purchase  comprised two semi-detached houses on one title.
<P>

8  	In 1934 Janet Ferguson married George Saunders and her sister,
Jane, the testator, married in 1936 to Leslie Lavender.  They
had one son,
Charles John, within about a year. In 1938 the plaintiff was born and in  1941
her grandfather, Thomas Ferguson, transferred
the property, 9 Julia Street,
Ashfield to the deceased, Jane Lavender. 
<P>

9  	1942 the plaintiff's father died and, as a result, the
plaintiff's mother and the plaintiff moved into 9 Julia Street, Ashfield.
That
was so that they could assist the plaintiff's grandmother.  The grandparents,
the plaintiff more and the plaintiff and her mother
shared one of the 2 semis
at 9 Julia Street, Ashfield.
<P>

10  	In 1947, Thomas Ferguson, the grandfather, died and the
arrangements continued for residence as before. The deceased, her husband
and
child, continued to reside in the other semi which she had occupied since,
probably, 1941.
<P>

11  	In 1951 there was a change in the ownership.  The deceased
granted a lease to the grandmother of 9 Julia Street, Ashfield,
being Flat 2,
in other words, the part occupied by the plaintiff and her mother for a period
of 7 years.  She then sold the whole
of the property, the subject of the lease,
and moved to a property at Epping which she purchased.  The plaintiff and her
mother remained
in the house at Ashfield in Flat 2 with the grandmother.
<P>

12  	In 1957, the plaintiff and her mother moved into a flat nearby
and on 2 July 1972, the  plaintiff's mother died which was a
traumatic event
for the plaintiff as she came home and found her mother dead. The immediate
response from the testator, her aunt,
was to come and take her to live with her
at Epping.  There was some confusion in the evidence given by the plaintiff
about what
happened and where she lived over the next 12 months.  It seems
clear that immediately on the death of her mother in July 1962, she
moved to
her aunt's at Epping. It is also clear by July or September in 1963 she had
purchased a unit which she did with the money
she received from her mother.
She also said that she spent 12 months in other rented accommodation.  However,
the evidence, which
seems to me more probable, is the evidence which she gave
in her affidavit and also repeated in the witness box about staying at
Epping
with Janet for a period of some five to six months.
<P>

13  	The reason why it is probable is because she recalls the
Christmas holidays that they took at the end of 1962.  That is likely
to stay
in her mind because it was during this period that difficulties with the
deceased's son, John, became evident. He was schizophrenic
and became
violent.
<P>

14  	As a result of this, the plaintiff had to leave and hence her
move for the first time to rented accommodation and then to a
unit which she
bought. It seems to me that the situation is that the plaintiff did live for
between five and six months with the
deceased at Epping.
<P>

15  	A year later, in 1963 as I have mentioned, the son of the
plaintiff died. In 1964 the deceased and her husband sold their house
at Epping
and moved to the  Roseville or Lindfield area. At about this time, the
plaintiff's grandmother died.
<P>

16  	In 1967 the plaintiff married Ivan Mitrovic and she had two
children of that marriage who are now 24 and 26. In 1985 the deceased
and her
husband moved to the North Haven Retirement Village and lived there for some
years.  He died, apparently, before the deceased.
<P>

17  	In 1992 the plaintiff and her husband separated and in due
course their house was sold.  The plaintiff moved into a flat in
1993. There
was the will to which I have referred and  in 1993, the plaintiff became ill
and was diagnosed with an hereditary disease,
which I will refer to later.  She
ceased work and for some 6 months or more went to the Central Coast to be with
her daughter. In
1994 the testator made her current will and died in 1997, as I
have recounted.
<P>

18  	For the plaintiff to be an eligible person in this matter, it is
necessary for her to show that she at some stage was part
of the household of
the deceased and also to show that she was partly dependent on the deceased.
The first relevant period is between
1942 and 1951 when the plaintiff was
living with her mother and grandmother and while the deceased, her husband and
son lived next
door in the other flat.  Although the properties did not have
separate yards for each of the flats, the semis were clearly separate
houses
and residences.  Therefore there were two households and, accordingly, the
plaintiff was not part of the household of the
deceased.
<P>

19  	The other period is in 1962 for five to six months. On that
occasion the plaintiff was taken into the deceased's household
and clearly was
part of that household for that period.  As far as dependency is concerned,
this is a little more difficult question.
<P>

20  	In Ball v Newey (1988) 13 NSW LR 1989, Samuels J at 409 said:
<P>

"His Honour concluded that &#180;dependent' meant financially dependent, a
proposition which has not been challenged in the appeal.
 It may be that there
are other forms of dependents analogous to but distinct from financial
dependents which would be capable of
satisfying the requirements of section
6(1) the definition of 'eligible person'.  In the present case, however, only
financial dependents
is relied on and I approach the matter on that bases.
&#180;Dependent' in the ordinary sense of the word, means the condition of
depending on something or on someone for what is needed.  In determining
whether that relationship exists, it is relevant to bear
in mind what was said
by Sankey LJ in Lee v Munro (1928) LJKB 49 AT 53;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20BWCC%20401" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 BWCC 401</a> at 408, that in
&#180;deciding whether or not there is dependency the factors to be considered
are past events and future probabilities".
 While it is true tha6t there we are
concerned with financial dependents and not emotional dependents, the whole
relationship between
the appellant and the deceased must be examined in the
light of that statement in order to exclude situations which might present
the
simulacrum but not the substance of dependency."
<P>

21  	In <b>Benny v Jones </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 559</a> the Court of Appeal
returned to the issue in a case where the only dependency was emotional
resulting from a homosexual relationship
between a party and the deceased.  The
Court rejected a submission that dependency may be based solely on the
existence of the relationship
without regard to any element of any financial
dependence.  
<P>

22  	In <b>Petrohilos v Hunter</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 343</a> at 346 the
Court once again considered the meaning of dependency.  At page 346 the Court
had the following to say:-
<P>

"I would respectfully disagree with the master in both respects. The word
"dependent" is an ordinary English word, and whether a
person is or has been
wholly or partly dependent upon another is a question of fact.  No doubt one of
the commonest forms of dependence
is a financial one, in the sense that the
dependence flows from the fact that accommodation, food, clothing and other
necessities
or amenities of life are provided by the person who owns or is
otherwise entitled to the accommodation and pays for the other things.
 But I
do not think that the word, as used in the statute or otherwise, has this very
limited meaning.  In ordinary parlance, young
children are properly and
commonly said to be dependent on their mother as well as their father,
regardless of where the money comes
from.  A contrary view, that young children
are not dependent on their mother if she has no independent means, seems to me
to be
a misuse of the language.  This accords with what Samuels JA said in<b>
Ball v Newey </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 489</a> at 491, that "'Dependent" in the ordinary
sense of the word, means the condition of depending on something or on someone
for what
is needed."  If the correct view were that the context of the statute
requires a limitation of the word to 'financial or material'
matters as
McLelland J said in <b>Re Fulop Deceased</b> or to 'other forms of dependence
analogous to but distinct from financial dependence' as Samuels JA suggested in
<b>Ball v Newey</b> (at 491), then surely a mother's services to a young child
satisfy the test.  The child could not survive without the provision of
those
services; he or she needs them.  To suggest that, in a money sense, they are
valueless, is simply wrong.  If the provision
of accommodation by a father for
a young child, that is, having the child live in a house which he owns and
lives in, can make the
child partly dependent upon the father, as it
undoubtedly can, I am unable to see why the provision by a mother to her
children,
living with her, of the services essential for their well-being does
not make them partly dependent upon her.  In my opinion it does.
 The same
considerations apply to a step-child or his or her step-mother, when the child
lives with the step-mother and is looked
after by her.  I appreciate that a
different view has been taken by others, as for example, by Powell J in <b>Dunn
v Public Trustee </b>(Powell J, 1 June 1989, unreported), but I would
respectfully disagree with that view.  In my opinion the plaintiff was partly
dependent
upon the deceased, certainly for many years of her childhood and
probably until her marriage, although no doubt her dependence diminished
in the
latter years of this period."
<P>

23  	In <b>McKenzie v. Baddeley</b> (Court of Appeal unreported 3
December 1991) his Honour Mr. Justice Meagher, although in the minority,
further discussed dependency
and described it as "financial economic or
material dependency not a mere emotional dependency".  Importantly in that case
the majority
held that the word "partly" in the phrase "partly dependent" does
not mean "substantially" rather it suggests "more than minimally"
or perhaps
"significantly". 
<P>

24  	It is abundantly clear from all these comments that dependency
is a matter to be determined from all the facts in the case.
<P>

25  	Once again there are two periods of concern.  The first is from
1942 to 1951.  It is clear that on the transfer of the properties
in 1942, the
testator at that time took over the responsibility for meeting the mortgage
that was on the house. Apart from this,
there is no evidence, apart from one
statement by the plaintiff, as to the arrangements for payment of rent. The
evidence is silent
and I would be reluctant to find dependency in this period
given the absence of evidence.
<P>

26  	However the second period in July to December 1962, is somewhat
clearer.  Clearly the plaintiff paid for her food because she
was working at
the time. She also helped with  odds bills such telephone and electricity.
However, she paid no rent or made no contribution
for accommodation.  There was
extracted in cross-examination an answer that the plaintiff paid her own way.
It is clear that for
the period she was provided with accommodation by the
deceased.  In these circumstances the provision of accommodation is certainly
more than minimal and, accordingly, I am satisfied that the plaintiff was
partly dependent upon the deceased.
<P>

27  	Accordingly, the plaintiff is an eligible person and it is
necessary to see whether there are factors warranting the making
of the
application in accordance with section 9(1) of the Act.
<P>

28  	The meaning of this expression has been dealt with by McLelland
J in <b>re Fulop Deceased</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 679</a> at 681. There his Honour said
the following:
<P>

"This means that in a particulars case the Court might determine that there are
&#180;factors which warrant the making of the application'
within the meaning
of the subsection, and yet go on to decide that the application should fail.
Since the subsection applies only
to certain classes of applicants, it suggests
that those classes of applicants need to demonstrate some basis for their
claims additional
to that required of other classes.  The difference between
the two sets of classes of applicants, in broad terms, seems to be that
the
classes not affected by s 9(1) (lawful and de factor spouses and children) are
as such generally regarded as natural objects
of testamentary recognition by a
deceased (cf the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration  Act 1898</a>, s 61B), whereas
the classes affected by s 9(1) (former spouses, and some time dependent
grandchildren or household members) are
as such not generally so regarded.
This suggests that the &#180;factors' referred to in the subsection are factors
which when added
to facts which render the applicant an &#180;eligible person'
give him or her the status of a person who would be generally regarded
as a
natural object of testamentary recognition by a deceased."
<P>

     
<P>

29  	In the present case, one has the history of contact between the
family of the deceased and the family of which the plaintiff
was a member. The
two families grew up together in adjoining houses, sharing common gardens and
it is clear that the plaintiff and
the deceased's son played together as they
grew up.
<P>

30  	The response of the deceased when the plaintiff's mother died is
quite illuminating. She regarded herself as the closest relative
of the
plaintiff and immediately took the plaintiff into her care following the
plaintiff finding her mother dead at home.  She obviously
acted like a mother
and  was concerned at the welfare of the plaintiff and also the plaintiff's
children whom she continued to take
an interest in despite the fact she
disproved of the plaintiff's husband.
<P>

31  	Another indicator that suggests there are factors  warranting,
is the way the deceased has treated the plaintiff during her
lifetime by the
references made in her wills. Clearly the deceased thought that the plaintiff
was someone who should have recognition
in her will.
<P>

32  	Given these factors, I am satisfied there are factors warranting
the making of the application.
<P>

33  	In applications under the Family Proceedings Act, the High Court
has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two
approaches that a Court must take. At page 209 it said the following: 
<P>

"The first question is, what the provision (if any) made for the applicant
&#180;inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance,
education and advancement
in life'?  The difference between 'adequate provision' and &#180;proper
maintenance' etc were explained
in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, the first stage of the process
the court may need to
arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what is
adequate provision, in which
event, if it  becomes necessary to embark upon the
second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the order
which should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a
court could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for
proper maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonable be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

   
<P>

34  	If, as directed by the High Court, one turns to the plaintiff's
financial situation, one finds that she is in a completely
parlous situation.
She owns a number of items of furniture and lives in a Housing Commission flat.
She has a liability which is a
loan to the credit union and she apparently only
owes about $400 on that with the last amount to be paid in September. She has a
pension of $364 per fortnight.  Apparently as other cheques come into her
account, she must be getting support most likely from her
children, in order to
make ends meet.  She has 2 children one of whom has 2 children of her own but
they are not dependent upon her.
<P>

35  	As far as her medical situation and work situation is concerned,
she worked as a secretary at various hospitals during her
lifetime.  In 1993
she was forced to give up work because she was diagnosed with mitochondrial
cytopathy which is a hereditary disease
which cannot be treated. It creates
muscle weakness, cognitive impairment and deafness.  She also suffers from
severe osteo-arthritis
in both knees and sleep apnoea.  She has some mild
hypertension requiring treatment by medication.  There has been evidence by her
consultant neurologist and I will come back to the detail of his report in due
course.
<P>

36  	As far as the relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased is concerned, it seems fairly clear that there was contact
over a long
period. In 1994 a solicitor saw the  deceased in order to get instructions to
make her last will. On that occasion, the
deceased said she wanted to reduce
the benefit to her niece as she did not see her and does not know where she is.
That was in July
1994.  Four months prior in April 1994, that the plaintiff had
returned from the Central Coast.  It seems fairly likely that the
absence of
the plaintiff following her illness when she was helped by her children,
probably accounted for the change of the testator's
intentions.
<P>

37  	Additionally I think that as the testator got older, although
the plaintiff continued to visit, the occasions probably became
less, no doubt
due to the fact that it was difficult for the deceased to communicate with the
plaintiff in her advancing illness
and old age. I would not be critical of this
and there is nothing in the relationship between the deceased and the plaintiff
which
would lead me to reduce any claims the plaintiff might have.
<P>

38  	The Court also has to take into account the situation of others
having a claim on the bounty of the deceased. There is no evidence
of any
contact between the deceased and the residuary beneficiaries. Clearly the gift
to North Haven Retirement Village is explained
by the treatment which the
deceased received over many years and also the gift of furniture to Margaret
Kidson, no doubt recognises
that friend's relationship.
<P>

39  	Effectively in the present case there are no competing claims to
that of the plaintiff. She is the last surviving member of
the family and there
is more than adequate in the residual bequests to accommodate any legacy to the
plaintiff.
<P>

40  	This brings one to the way in which the plaintiff has been left
without adequate provision for her proper maintenance, education
and
advancement in life.
<P>

41  	In a letter addressed to the defendant and dated 6 March 1998,
the plaintiff's solicitors set out the extent of the claim.
The items sought
are, first, provision for the purchase of a 3 bedroom residence in the Hills
areas for $175,000; furniture and appliances
$45,000; repayment of the credit
union  loan $3,000; clothing $5,000; legal costs and relocation expenses of
$25,000; an amount to
be invested for income of $200,000. I note that the
amount of the loan is now substantially less and is about $400.
<P>

42  	Clearly, as was evident in the hearing before me, the plaintiff
needs to acquire a hearing aid as her hearing loss is quite
advanced.  However,
the evidence is silent on all these needs. In this regard, I am reminded by
what was said by Sheller JA in the
Court of Appeal in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b>
on 23 July 1992.  There his Honour had the following to say:
<P>

"I must say that I find it extraordinary that the appellant presented scant or
no evidence as to her present income and outgoings
or as to her intentions or
needs for the future or as to what lump sum provision applying appropriate
discount tables would be required
to meet these claims or needs, if the
existed.  In my opinion, in the circumstance of this case, for the court, in
the absence of
any such evidence, to make an order for the payment to the
appellant of a lump sum is to do no more than act on speculation and,
contrary
to the prohibition contained in s 9(2) of the Act, to alter the deceased's
disposition of his property the absence of proof
that he has inadequately
provided for the appellant."
<P>

43  	If one turns to the claim for provision for accommodation, the
first thing to note is that there was no evidence before me
of what would be
the cost of any such accommodation.  Also there is no reason advanced as to why
the existing accommodation in the
Housing Commission flat is not appropriate. A
desire is expressed to have one but that is all it is.
<P>

44  	The other matter that has to be considered is whether or not,
even if it were in evidence, it might be appropriate to provide
a house. In
<b>Sheerer v The Public Trustee</b> Young J, 23 March 1998, his Honour had this
to say:
<P>

"The community's attitude is not to be judged by a feelings to whether it is
morally wrong for a person to leave property otherwise
than to her spouse or
children.  One must really look at the obligations to provide for persons who
have some dependants.
<P>

 
<P>

Where the applicant is a spouse it is nowadays usually thought that to leave a
spouse with a mere right or residence is insufficient
provision.  However, that
is not the case with children, and as far as I am aware it has never been said
by any court that it is
an obligation that the community expects that a mother
will leave her child in a position where the child has a house of his or her
own."
<P>

45  	In the present case, one also that is to take into account the
relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased. Here the
plaintiff is not
a child but merely a niece and the relevant factors to take into account are
the facts which I have set out when
dealing with factors warranting.  It is
thus necessary to consider  those when judging the extent of provision that is
appropriate.
<P>

46  	In this case, I would not have thought the provision of a house
was appropriate. Clearly there is some necessity for the plaintiff
to repay her
debt, acquire a hearing aid and have some amount to relieve the difficulties of
her circumstances.  She is after all
living on the breadline being reliant on
the pension.
<P>

47  	The other problem for the plaintiff is the difficulty with her
medical condition. The consultant neurologist,  Mr Sharpe, dealt
with it in a
report and referred to the fact that she had to give up her work. Neurological
tests have confirmed memory problems
both in 1993 and 1994. He says in his
report:
<P>

"Although she has been living alone from time to time she finds it difficult
because of her poor memory and difficulty with concentration.
 There have been
some minor signs of psychosis helped with Melleril 50mg at night.  She appears
to have developed sleep apnoea with
excessive day time tiredness and this is
being investigated.  She continues to have proximal muscle weakness but is
still able to
get about.
<P>

 
<P>

Should not be living alone because Janet is not able to work productively and
she should not be living alone because of her various
symptoms.  Her condition
is likely to deteriorate further with the passage of time."
<P>

     
<P>

48  	This is the crux of the claim brought by the plaintiff  and her
situation at the moment is that apparently the daughter is
living with the
plaintiff, looking after her. There was no evidence from the daughter as to
what are her circumstances.
<P>

49  	The other areas where the evidence is scant is questions of the
life expectancy of the plaintiff based upon her medical condition
and also
generally.  There is also no attempt in the evidence to suggest what might be
the appropriate cost in the event that her
daughter is not able to look after
her and for how long those expenses might go on. The future likelihood of when
the plaintiff will
have to go into some nursing home has not been dealt with in
the medical evidence and it obviously is important to the court, in
order to
apply and assess the medical needs.
<P>

50  	I have the benefit of my own observations of the plaintiff in
the witness box. Clearly she has a hearing difficulty.  That
was very evident.
It is also apparent from the way she gave her evidence and the  history in the
matter, that her memory loss is
quite severe and no doubt is a result of her
illness.  In a physical sense she is frail and needs the assistance of a
walking stick.
 Her condition is likely to deteriorate further with the passage
of time and the effect of her muscle spasms as a result of this
inherited
disease.
<P>

51  	In my view it is likely she will need assistance in the future
and that assistance may not always be available from her daughter
who is 26,
single and probably will want to establish her own  life at some stage.
<P>

52  	There are no competing claims in this case.  The question of
what is an appropriate provision in respect of large estates is
dealt with by
Young J in <b>Anasson v Phillips</b>, 4 March 1998 where his Honour said the
following:
<P>

"...with a very large estate...there is a great temptation on a court to be
over-generous with other people's money.  This is especially
so when the court
can see that plaintiffs have been very hardly done by at the hands of a
domineering testatrix.  However, the case
should not be approached in this way
as the application has to be determined in accordance with the legal
principles.  These principles
include the fact that in Australia there is
freedom of a person to leave her property in whatever way she wishes, to love
whom she
wishes, to hate whom she wishes and there is only when there has been
a failure to comply with a moral duty to those who is the community's
eyes she
should have made proper provision for, that anyone can legally complain about
another person's will.  Even then, the court
has no power to re-write the will,
but can only adjust things, in substitution for the testatrix, in such a way as
to fulfil her
moral duty.
<P>

 
<P>

If the estate is a large one, the court has a slightly different approach.
The basic principles are the same, that is, the will
can only be affected to
the extent that it is necessary to discharge the moral duty my making  adequate
provision for the plaintiffs,
but where there is a large estate, competition
between claimant and claimant, and claimant and beneficiary under the will is
much
reduced or  eliminated.  Further, there may be a more liberal assessment
of the moral duty owed, to be reflected in what is proper
provision for the
plaintiffs.  In particular, the lifestyle that has been enjoyed by the
plaintiffs, because they have been associated
with a wealthy testatrix is a
relevant factor.  These principles all, I think flow from cases such as <b>Re
Buckland</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1966/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] VicRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20VR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) VR 404</a>, especially at page 412."
<P>

53  	In my view, this is a case where it is a fairly large estate
without competing claims.  Accordingly one can be a little bit
more generous
than one would in an ordinary case. However, one cannot speculate in the
absence of evidence. Doing the best I can,
I think it is appropriate that the
plaintiff have a legacy of $125,000.
<P>

54  	The question arises as to how it should be provided. When she
sold her house in 1992, following the breakup of her marriage,
the plaintiff
received about $60,000 after payment of the debts. In June 1994 she received
$35,000 from superannuation.   At one
stage she tried to buy a newsagency and
over the years since 1992 she has moved houses on eight occasions.
Notwithstanding that fact,
she cannot explain what has happened to $95,000 odd
that she received.  All the she can tell the court is it has all gone and she
denies  giving it to her children.
<P>

55  	The question of how to deal with a what might be called
spendthrifts are  dealt with by Young J in <b>Vavros v Bondy</b>, unreported 29
August 1988 and also the decision of Powell J in <b>Howarth v Reed</b>. Their
Honours referred to the possibility of a provision not being applied by the
person for the purposes intended by the court.
 At page 43 and 44, his Honour
went on a to say:
<P>

"While, as will be apparent from what I have earlier written, I am deeply
concerned what I regard as the totally unrealistic approach
to the management
of their affairs adopted by Mr and Mrs Howarth, which approach, if persisted
in, will almost inevitably lead to
the benefit of any Order which might be made
in Mrs Howarth's favour being dissipated in short order, it seems to me that,
while
that is a matter which may bear on the form of Order to be made, it is
not a matter which ought, without more, to be regarded as
disqualifying Mrs
Howarth from receiving th4e benefit of any order to which she might otherwise
be entitled.  Nor is this a novel
view, for a similar approach is reflected in
the following passage in the Judgement of Young J in <b>Bondy v Vavros</b> (29
August 1988(unreported)):&#180;I should interpose at this point that in one
sense it does not matter if I form the view that
a plaintiff is a spendthrift
If a person is entitled to an order, what they do with the money that they
receive is their business
and it is none of my affair if I very much fear that
the money may be wasted on wine, women and song in a short period of time. 
I
have used that expression to make it clear that I am not referring at the
moment to the facts of this particular case.  One the
other hand, when one is
considering what a wise and just testator would have done, if one can see that
a plaintiff is a spendthrift
and the testator has arranged his will in such a
way as to limit the funds flowing to the plaintiff, then one may very well come
to the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to establish that there has
been any breach of moral duty.'
<P>

  
<P>

The question, then, is what is the form of the Order ought now to be made?"
<P>

     
<P>

56  	In the present case, although the plaintiff cannot explain what
happened to her money, there is no independent evidence which
might suggest
that it has been misapplied in some inappropriate way.  It is hard to think it
could have disappeared in supporting
her and moving on a number of occasion,
but, absent any specific evidence as to what was the reason for the money's
disappearance,
I find it difficulty to conclude that the plaintiff is a
spendthrift and therefore some  special order ought to be made.
<P>

57  	Accordingly the orders I make are:
<P>

(1) I order that in lieu of legacy of $5,000 the plaintiff receive a legacy of
$125,000.
<P>

(2) The plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis and the defendant's costs
on an indemnity basis be paid or retained out of
the estate of the deceased.
<P>

(3) The exhibits can be returned.
<P>

                             oOo
