<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<u>The Proceedings</u>
<P>

<u>The Statement of Claim</u>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  By amended statement of claim filed 24 February 1999
Paul Andrew Cronk, the first plaintiff, Jake Hugo, the second
plaintiff and
Hugo &amp; Cronk Pty. Limited, the third plaintiff, claimed against the
Sunnyfield Association, trading as Ablite Industries,
the defendant, being an
employer of intellectually disabled people in the industrial lighting industry,
that the first plaintiff
was at all material times the inventor of an
adjustable reflector device commercially marketed by the defendant as
"Adjust-A- Shade"
(thereinafter referred to as "the Product").  The plaintiffs
further alleged that the Product was the subject of certain patent
applications,
including an international patent application.  It was also
alleged that in about March 1994 the first plaintiff commenced discussions
with
the board of directors of the defendant, the subject of the discussions being
the commercial development production and marketing
of the Product.
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs further alleged that on or about 16 May 1994 an
agreement dated 16 May 1994 between the first plaintiff and the
defendant was
signed by the first plaintiff and by Mr. John Homan on behalf of the defendant.
It was alleged that this agreement
of 16 May 1994 was entered into in the
context of certain representations made by Mr. Homan to the first plaintiff on
6 April 1994
as particularised.
<P>

3  	The agreement of 16 May 1994 contained, inter alia, the following
paragraphs:-
<P>

<i>"It is agreed between the undersigned parties that:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	An initial exclusive period of up to SIX months be given to ABLITE to
research the market potential for the above product, after
which time an
agreement will be negotiated in accordance with paragraph 2 below</i>
<P>

<i>2.	ABLITE to have first right of refusal to manufacturing and
distributorship rights after the initial period, and subject to an agreement
to
proceed will require a formal agreement which sets out" (various
matters).</i>
<P>

4  	The plaintiffs alleged in the statement of claim that no "formal
agreement" as referred to, inter alia, in paragraph 2 of, inter
alia, the
agreement dated 16 May 1994 was ever prepared and/or executed as between the
first plaintiff and the defendant, nor between
the first plaintiff and Mr.
Homan.
<P>

5  	I interpolate to note that the defendant claimed to the contrary,
namely, that such a "formal agreement", executed on 10 May
1995, was entered
into by the first plaintiff and the defendant.  This issue was the principal
issue in dispute between the parties
to the proceedings.
<P>

6  	The statement of claim also alleged, in effect, that in about
November 1994 the defendant sought an extension of the "initial
exclusive
period" of up to "SIX months" referred to, inter alia, in paragraph 1 of the
agreement of 16 May 1994.
<P>

7  	I note that it is not in dispute that it was, in fact, agreed
that there should be such an extension of the "initial exclusive
period", which
ended in November 1994, for a further six months ending in May 1995.
<P>

8  	The statement of claim alleged that a meeting took place between
the first plaintiff and the certain officers of the defendant
on 2 May 1995
when certain representations were allegedly made by those officers on behalf of
the defendant to the plaintiffs.
<P>

9  	The plaintiffs also alleged in the statement of claim that on 10
May 1995 a "document <u>purporting</u> to be an agreement" (underlining
supplied) was signed by the first plaintiff and executed on behalf of the
defendant under the common
seal of the defendant.
<P>

10  	I note that this document is the agreement relied upon by the
defendant as constituting the "formal agreement" contemplated
in paragraph 2 of
the agreement of 16 May 1994.  As stated above, the plaintiffs denied that this
was so.
<P>

11  	As noted in the statement of claim, this agreement of 10 May
1995 was dated on its first page 2 May 1995, whilst on its second
page it
recorded that "This initial agreement is made and signed on the tenth day of
May 1994."  It is not, however, in dispute that
this agreement in that form was
in fact signed by the parties on 10 May 1995, and hereafter, as appropriate,
this agreement will
be referred to as the<b> </b>agreement of 10 May 1995.
<P>

12  	The statement of claim referred, in relation to the agreement of
10 May 1995, to its opening words which were as follows:-
<P>

<i>"This Agreement covers the initial development of the product known as
Adjust-A-Shade, which is covered by Patent Pending No. PM2504".</i>
<P>

13  	These words in the agreement of 10 May 1995 were, in the course
of the proceedings, claimed by the plaintiffs to support their
submission that
that agreement (of 10 May 1995), on its true construction, operated to extend
the research and development period
for the Product for a further three years,
whereas the defendant submitted that, notwithstanding those words, and having
regard to
the balance of the agreement and to the surrounding circumstances,
the agreement of 10 May 1995, on its true construction, constituted
the initial
grant to it of a three year manufacturing and distribution period (with an
option for a further three years).
<P>

14  	The statement of claim also alleged that on 10 July 1996 the
first plaintiff assigned his rights to the patent applications
to the third
plaintiff and, further, that on 30 October 1996, the third plaintiff "acting on
representations made to it by the Defendant
entered into an agreement with the
Defendant."  The agreement of 30 October 1996 provided, in effect, inter alia,
that the third
plaintiff would be bound by the agreement of 10 May 1995.
<P>

15  	The agreement of 30 October 1996 was claimed by the defendant to
have produced, according to its express terms, the result
that the third
plaintiff became bound by the terms of the agreement of 10 May 1995 granting to
the defendant<b> </b>a manufacturing and distribution period of three years
(with an option for a further three years) and it does not appear that this
was
disputed by the defendant, in the event that the submissions of the defendant
as to the true construction of the agreement of
10 May 1995 were to be
upheld.
<P>

16  	The statement of claim also alleged that the representation
alleged to have been made to the third plaintiff by the defendant
was that
"there was a binding agreement as between the First Plaintiff and the Defendant
(being the agreement of 10 May 1995) as
to the <u>manufacture</u> of `the
Product'" (underlining supplied), it being understood that it was claimed by
the plaintiffs, and denied by the defendant,
that this representation was
untrue, it being claimed by the plaintiffs and denied by the defendant that the
agreement related only
to the research and development period.
<P>

17  	The plaintiffs also alleged in the amended statement of claim
that on 1 May 1998 the third plaintiff had assigned its rights
to the patent
application to the first and second plaintiffs equally, who on that date
entered into a deed of partnership in respect
of those patent applications.
The defendant claimed that this purported assignment was ineffective to deprive
it of its rights as
exclusive license and generally under the agreement of 10
May 1995.
<P>

18  	The statement of claim also alleged that as at that date,
namely, 1 May 1998, the third plaintiff ceased to have any interest
in the
patent applications and/or the product and that as at 31 July 1998 it (the
third plaintiff) sought to be deregistered.
<P>

19  	In subsequent paragraphs of the amended statement of claim the
plaintiffs alleged, in effect, that there was no relevant agreement
between the
parties by reason of uncertainty as to the terms of any such agreement which
was accordingly void.
<P>

20  	The plaintiffs also alleged that there was no binding agreement
between the parties dated 16 May 1994 as such agreement was
entered into, if at
all. between the first plaintiff and Mr. Homan personally and not as between
the first plaintiff and the defendant.
 It was further alleged in the
alternative that if the agreement of 10 May 1994 was binding upon the parties
(including the defendant)
then that agreement expired on 10 May 1997, on the
basis that it was claimed by the plaintiffs, although denied by the defendant,
that the defendant was not entitled to any option for a further three years
pursuant to the agreement of 10 May 1995.
<P>

21  	The plaintiffs also alleged, in effect, that the purported
exercise by the defendant of its option to renew the term of three
years by way
of letter dated 2 February 1998 and. in accordance with the agreement of 10 May
1994, was ineffective because the option
had lapsed in or about February 1997,
and that the agreement duly came to an end on 9 May 1997.
<P>

22  	The amended statement of claim then claimed relief pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <b><i>Contracts Review Act</i></b><i> 1980.</i>
<P>

23  	It was also claimed that by reason of certain representations
made by officers of the defendant on behalf of the defendant
that the defendant
had been guilty both of unconscionable conduct within the meaning of section
51AA of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i></b><i> 1974 </i>and misleading and/or
deceptive conduct within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of that Act.
<P>

24  	The plaintiff sought relief accordingly.  
<P>

<u>The Amended Notice of Grounds of Defence</u>
<P>

25  	By its amended notice of grounds of defence, the defendant,
inter alia, alleged, in effect, that on or about 16 May 1994, the
first
plaintiff and the defendant executed an agreement of that date as described in
the amended statement of claim, which the defendant
alleged granted it a
research and development period of six months in relation to the Product.
<P>

26  	The defendant also alleged that on or about 25 October 1994 the
first plaintiff and the defendant agreed that the initial exclusive
period (for
research and development) referred to in the agreement dated 16 May 1994 was to
be extended for a further six months
to 16 May 1995.  This was not disputed by
the plaintiffs.
<P>

27  	The defendant also alleged that on or about 10 May 1995 a
(binding) agreement was executed by the first plaintiff and the defendant,
being the agreement of 10 May 1995.  The defendant alleged that the reference
on the second page of the agreement of 10 May 1995
to "the tenth day of May
1994" was "a clear typographical error".
<P>

28  	The defendant admitted that on 30 October 1996 the third
plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant but denied
the
assignment of 1 May 1998 from the third plaintiff to the first and second
plaintiffs equally, and alleged that any such assignment
was "in any event
invalid as against the defendant".
<P>

29  	In relation to certain paragraphs in the amended statement of
claim the defendant denied the allegations and stated that it
would "rely on
the contents of the agreements executed on 16 May 1994 and 10 May 1995 for
their full force and effect."  In answer
to a further paragraph in the amended
statement of claim the defendant alleged that the reference in the agreement
executed on 10
May 1995 to the agreement dated 6 April 1994 was "a clear
typographical error" and should<b> </b>have been a reference to the agreement
dated 16 May 1994.
<P>

30  	The defendant also claimed that it sought to and did exercise
validly its option contained in sub-paragraph (a) of the agreement
of 10 May
1995 by way of letter dated 2 February 1998 from the defendant to the third
plaintiff.
<P>

31  	Paragraphs 17 - 26 of the defendant's amended notice of grounds
of defence were in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"17. 	In answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, the Defendant says
that on 10 July 1996, the First Plaintiff assigned the
benefit of his invention
to Third Plaintiff, and on 30 October 1996, entered into an agreement with the
Defendant which confirmed
the binding nature of the 10 May 1995 Agreement on
Third Plaintiff, and whereby the Third Plaintiff agreed to be bound by the
terms
of the 10 May 1995 Agreement.</i>
<P>

<center><b><i>Particulars</i></b></center>
<P>


<P>

<i>Assignment dated 10 July 1996 between the First Plaintiff and Third
Plaintiff</i>
<P>

<i>Contract dated 30 October 1996 between the First and Third Plaintiffs and
the Defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>18.	Further and in the alternative, in answer to the whole of the Statement
of Claim, by purporting to take assignment of the Third
Plaintiffs rights by
Agreement dated 1 May 1998 and by purporting to grant an exclusive licence in
respect of those rights to Accent
Hydroponics Pty Limited, with knowledge of
the 10 May 1995 Agreement and the 30 October 1996 Agreement, the First and
Second Plaintiffs
have procured and are intending to procure a breach of those
agreements and the Defendant is entitled to enjoin the<b> </b>First and Second
Plaintiffs from doing so.</i>
<P>

<i>19.	Further and in the alternative, in answer to the whole of the Statement
of Claim, it was a common assumption of the parties to
the 30 October 1996
Agreement or alternatively the First, Second and Third Plaintiffs by executing
the 30 October 1996 Agreement
represented to or contributed to an assumption on
the part of the Defendant:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	that the Third Plaintiff was and would be for the period of the 10 May
1995 Agreement entitled to grant an exclusive licence in
accordance with the 10
May 1995 Agreement;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that the Third Plaintiff would not assign its rights so as to interfere
with or derogate from the Defendant's right under the
10 May 1995
Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>20.	On the basis of the assumption and in reliance upon the representation
in 19 above, the Defendant entered into and performed the
30 October 1996
Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>21.	In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs are estopped from denying the
matters 19(a) and (b) above.</i>
<P>

<i>22.	Further and in the alternative in answer to the whole of the Statement
of Claim:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	any purported assignment of the Third Plaintiff's rights by the
Agreement dated 1 May 1998 was a breach of the Agreement dated
30 October
1996;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the Plaintiffs entered into the Agreement dated 1 May 1998, knowing that
act constituted a breach of the Agreement dated 30 October
1996;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the First and Second Plaintiffs have purported to take the benefit of
the assignment, knowing that it was in breach of the Agreement
dated 30 October
1996;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the Third Plaintiff has continued, after the purported assignment on 1
May 1998, to accept payments of royalties from the Defendant
in accordance with
the 10 May 1995 Agreement and 30 October 1996 Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>23.	In the circumstances, it is unconscionable for the Plaintiffs or any of
them to maintain that the First and Second Plaintiffs
can deal with the
interests purportedly assigned to them on 1 May 1998 in disregard of the rights
of the Defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>24.	In the circumstances, the First and Second Plaintiffs hold any such
interests as were assigned to them on 1 May 1998 on trust
to deal with them in
accordance with the terms of the 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996
Agreements.</i>
<P>

<i>25.	Further and in the alternative, by reason of the matters in paragraph
22(d) above, the Plaintiffs are estopped from denying that
the Third Plaintiff
is entitled to and obliged to carry out the 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996
Agreements</i>
<P>

<i>26.	Further and in the alternative, by reason of the matters in paragraph 22
above or alternatively paragraphs 19 and 22 above, the
Plaintiffs are
disentitled to seek any equitable relief in this matter."</i>
<P>

32  	All other material allegations made by the plaintiffs against
the defendant were in effect, denied by the defendant.
<P>

<u>The Amended Cross-Claim</u>
<P>

33  	By its amended cross-claim the defendant relied on the agreement
of 10 May 1995 as being to the effect that the defendant was
entitled "to
exclusively manufacture and distribute a product called "Adjust-A-Shade'".
<P>

34  	The defendant alleged that it was an express term of the 10 May
1995 agreement that the duration of the agreement was three
years and that the
defendant had an option to extend the agreement for a further three year period
provided the defendant exercised
that option within three months of the
termination of the first three year term.
<P>

35  	The defendant alleged that on or about 10 July 1996 the third
plaintiff<b> </b>(fourth<b> </b>cross-defendant) was assigned the benefit of
the 10 May 1995 agreement<b> </b>by assignment dated 10 July 1996 between the
first and second plaintiffs and the<b> </b>third plaintiff (fourth
cross-defendant).
<P>

36  	The defendant alleged that by an agreement in writing dated 30
October 1996 the third plaintiff (fourth cross-defendant) agreed
to be bound by
the terms of the 10 May 1995 agreement, and that on or about 2 February 1998
the defendant exercised its option to
extend the term of the 10 May 1995
agreement to 16 May 2001 by letter dated 2 February 1998 from the defendant to
the third plaintiff
(fourth cross-defendant).
<P>

37  	The defendant alleged that on or about 1 May 1998 the third
plaintiff (fourth cross-defendant) purportedly transferred its
interest in the
10 May 1995 agreement to the first and second plaintiffs individually at a time
when the first and second plaintiffs
well knew of the 10 May 1995 agreement and
the 30 October 1996 agreement and the terms thereof.
<P>

38  	The defendant further claimed that on or about 25 May 1998
Accent Hydroponics Pty. Limited (the first cross-defendant) ("Accent")
entered
into a contract with the first and second plaintiffs for the exclusive
manufacturing and distribution of the same product
covered by the 10 May 1995
agreement and thereby induced and procured a breach of the 10 May 1995
agreement by the first, second
and third plaintiffs.
<P>

39  	The defendant further alleged that not later than 22 September
1998 the first cross-defendant (Accent) commenced selling the
product which was
the same product covered by the 10 May 1995 agreement and thereby induced and
procured a breach of the 10 May 1995
agreement by the first, second and third
plaintiffs.
<P>

40  	Further, in the alternative, the defendant claimed it was an
implied term of the 30 October 1996 agreement that the third plaintiff
(fourth
cross-defendant) was and would remain for the whole term of the 10 May 1995
agreement able to licence exclusively to the
defendant the manufacture of the
"Adjust-A- Shade" and that the third plaintiff (fourth cross-defendant) would
not assign such rights
as it had which enabled it to comply with its
obligations to the defendant under the 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996
agreements.
<P>

41  	The defendant further alleged that the third plaintiff (fourth
cross-defendant) had breached the implied term referred to and
had also with
knowledge of the terms of the agreement of 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996
induced and procured a breach thereof.
<P>

42  	There followed certain claims that the third plaintiff (fourth
cross-defendant) had been guilty of unconscionable conduct within
the meaning
"of the unwritten law in breach of section 51AA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>" and
that the first and second plaintiffs had aided, abetted or been directly or
indirectly involved in the contravention of that
section, but it does not
appear that these matters were pursued in final address on behalf of the
defendant.
<P>

43  	The defendant sought certain consequential relief.  
<P>

<u>The Defence to the Amended Cross-Claim</u>
<P>

44  	The plaintiffs filed a defence to the amended cross-claim
denying all relevant matters of material substance and, in effect,
recapitulating their case as set out in the amended statement of claim.  It
should be noted, however, that the first cross-defendant
alleged in the defence
to the amended cross-claim that it had ceased to sell any product the same
and/or similar to the "Adjust-A-
Shade" product, the<b> </b>subject of these
proceedings.
<P>

<u>The Facts</u>
<P>

<u>Preliminary</u>
<P>

45  	It is impracticable and, in my opinion, unnecessary, to
endeavour to set out in this judgment the whole of what transpired
between the
parties in relation to the subject matter of these proceedings.  There were
many discussions between the parties on various
subject matters relevant to the
proceedings as well as correspondence and draft agreements.  The broad outline
of what occurred may
be seen from the pleadings including in particular, but
not limited to, the amended statement of claim and the amended notice of
grounds of defence.  More detail appears, of course, from the affidavits filed
on behalf of the various parties.  It is sufficient,
however, in my opinion,
for it to be noted that the principal dispute between the parties related to
the meaning and effect of the
agreement executed by the first plaintiff and by
the defendant under the common seal on 10 May 1995 which execution was preceded
by various conversation and various documents including draft agreements but in
particular by the agreement dated 16 May 1994.
<P>

<u>The Agreement of 16 May 1994</u>
<P>

46  	The agreement dated 16 May 1994 was in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"16 May 1994</i>
<P>

<center><i>ADJUST-A-SHADE</i></center>
<P>


<P>

<i>This Agreement covers the initial development of the product known as
`Adjust-A-Shade', which is covered by patent Pending No. PM2504.</i>
<P>

<i>It is agreed between the undersigned parties that:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	An initial exclusive period of up to SIX months be given to ABLITE to
research the market potential for the above product, after
which time an
agreement will be negotiated in accordance with paragraph 2 below.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	ABLITE to have first right of refusal to manufacturing and
distributorship rights after the initial period, and subject to an agreement
to
proceed will require a formal agreement which sets out:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Exclusive manufacturing and distributorship within Australia and New
Zealand for a fixed period of three years with an option
of three years
exercisable not less than three months prior to the end of the third
year.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Agreed value of royalties payable on sale of units.  We agreed to
$2.50/unit for small units and $3.00/unit for large units, (payable
30 days
after the end of the calendar month in which the sale occurs).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Agreement is subject to the securing of the Patent Rights by Mr. Paul
Cronk.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Mr. Paul Cronk, (Inventor), to indemnify Sunnyfield against all actions
or claims relating to any infringement of Patent rights
which might be brought
against The Association arising directly or indirectly from the manufacture,
sale, distribution, or use of
the wing type reflector, (Patent Pending
PM2504)."</i>
<P>

<i>This initial agreement is made and signed on the sixteenth day of May 1994,
between Mr. Paul Cronk ... and ABLITE a division of The
Sunnyfield Association
...".</i>
<P>

47  	There is no dispute, but in any event, I hold that this
agreement was executed on or<b> </b>about 16 May 1994 by the first plaintiff
personally and by Mr. John Homan on behalf of the defendant.  This agreement
will be given
more detailed consideration later in this judgment under the
heading "Construction of the Agreement of 10 May 1995" but it may be
noted
briefly at this point that the agreement was stated to cover "the initial
development of the product known as 'Adjust-A- Shade'"
and that it was provided
that an "initial exclusive period" of up to six months would be given to the
defendant "to research the
market potential for the above product after which
time an agreement will be negotiated in accordance with paragraph 2 below."
<P>

48  	It will also be noted that paragraph 2 of the agreement of 16
May 1994 provided that the defendant was to have "first right
of refusal to
manufacturing and distributorship rights after the initial period" and that
"subject to an agreement to proceed" "will
require a formal agreement" setting
out various matters including, inter alia, "Exclusive manufacturing and
distributorship within
Australia and New Zealand for a fixed period of three
years with an option of three years exercisable not less than three months
prior to the end of the third year."
<P>

<u>The Agreement of 10 May 1995</u>
<P>

49  	In due course, after further discussions and correspondence and
draft agreements, there followed what I have described as the
agreement of 10
May 1995.  This agreement is in fact, as stated above, dated on the first page
2 May 1995 whilst on page 2 it is
stated, inter alia, that "This initial
agreement is made and signed on the tenth day of May 1994 between Mr. Paul
Cronk ... and ABLITE
a division of the Sunnyfield Association ...".
<P>

50  	This agreement, which as stated above, will be referred to as
the agreement of 10 May 1995, was in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"2 May 1995</i>
<P>

<center><i>ADJUST-A-SHADE</i></center>
<P>


<P>

<i>This Agreement covers the initial development of the product known as
'Adjust-A-Shade', which is covered by Patent Pending No. 64800/94.</i>
<P>

<i>It is agreed between the undersigned parties that following the initial
exclusive period, the original agreement of 6th April 1994
be amended and
extended for a further period of three years from 16th May 1995 to 16th May
1998.</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Exclusive manufacturing and distributorship within Australia and New
Zealand for a fixed period of three years with an option
of three years
exercisable not less than three months prior to the end of the third
year.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Agreed value of royalties payable on sale of units. We agreed to
$2.50/unitfor small units and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">S3.</a> 00/unit for large units, (payable 30 days
after the end of the calendar month in which the sale occurs).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Agreement is subject to the securing of the Patent Rights by Mr. Paul
Cronk.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	It was also agreed that for the purpose of verification of quantities
sold per month, Mr. Paul Cronk would have access, under
supervision, to our
computer records in relation to his specific product.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Mr. Paul Cronk, (Inventor), to indemnify Sunnyfield against all actions
or claims relating to any infringement of Patent rights
which might be brought
against The Association arising directly or indirectly from the manufacture,
sale, distribution, or use of
the wing type reflector, (Patent Pending No.
64800/94).</i>
<P>

<i>This initial agreement is made and signed on the tenth day of May 1994,
between Mr Paul Cronk of 1/65 Evans Street, Harbord, and ABLITE
a division of
The Sunnyfield Association of 185 Allambie Road, Allambie Heights 2100."</i>
<P>

51  	This agreement of 10 May 1995 will be the subject of further
consideration below but it may be noted here that it is stated,
as it was in
the agreement of 16 May 1994, that the agreement (of 10 May 1995) covers "the
initial development of the product known
as 'Adjust-A- Shade'".  In my opinion,
for reasons which will appear later, these words were not an apt description of
the agreement
of 10 May 1995 which was, in my opinion, an agreement granting to
the defendant a manufacturing and distribution period of three
years with an
option for a further three years.  It may also be noted here that, in my
opinion, again for reasons which will appear
hereafter, the reference to "the
original agreement of 6 April 1994" should have been a reference to "the
original agreement of 16
May 1994".
<P>

52  	It should also be noted that prior to the execution of the
agreement of 10 May 1995 the "initial exclusive period of up to
six months"
given to the defendant "to research the market potential for the above product"
had been extended by agreement for a
further period of six months to 16 May
1995 as evidenced by the letter dated 24 October 1994 from the defendant to the
first plaintiff,
signed by the first plaintiff on 16 December 1994.
<P>

53  	It should also be noted that as at the date of signing of the
agreement of 10 May 1995 the evidence was to the effect that
no further
research and development period was required prior to the defendant entering
upon its manufacturing and distribution period.
<P>

54  	It should also be noted that paragraph (a) of the agreement of
10 May 1995 provided that the defendant should have, in addition
to "Exclusive
manufacturing and distributorship within Australia and New Zealand for a fixed
period of three years" "an option of
three years exercisable not less than
three months prior to the end of the third year."
<P>

<u>The Assignment of 10 July 1996</u>
<P>

55  	On or about 10 July 1996 the first plaintiff assigned to the
third plaintiff defendant) "the entire right, title and interest
in and to,
inter alia, the invention relating to the Product.  This assignment was in the
following terms:-

<P>

<u>The Deed of Partnership of 1 May 1998</u>
<P>

63  	By deed of partnership of 1 May 1998 the first and second
plaintiffs agreed to become partners in the business of manufacturing,
marketing and distribution of the "invention" the subject of the relevant
patent applications.
<P>

<u>The Agreement of </u><cite>25 </cite><u>May 1998</u>
<P>

64  	On <i>25 </i>May 1998, Accent Hydroponics Pty. Limited (the
first cross-defendant) entered into an agreement dated <i>25 </i>May 1998 with
the first and second plaintiffs for the exclusive right to manufacture, market
and distribute, in effect, the product
covered by the 10 May 1995 agreement for
an initial term of three years and with provision for successive terms of three
years. 
There was initially some suggestion on behalf of the plaintiffs and
Accent that this agreement was not in respect of the relevant
product but
ultimately this was not pursued.  In any event I find that the agreement of 25
May 1998 was in respect of the relevant
product and in this connection I note
that after receiving a letter of demand dated 13 October 1998, from the
defendant, Accent ceased
manufacture of the product pending the outcome of
these proceedings.
<P>

65  	Clause 34 of that agreement provided that the first
cross-defendant would pay up to a maximum of $20,000 towards legal costs
incurred in these proceedings by the first and second plaintiffs and clause 33
of the agreement provided for its termination by either
party to the agreement
in the event that a court of law found in favour of the defendant or if the
parties compromised these proceedings
on the basis that the defendant was
entitled to exercise its rights during the option period of three years.
<P>

66  	In October 1998 the first cross-defendant ceased to manufacture,
distribute and sell the relevant product until the determination
of these
proceedings.
<P>

<u>Construction of the Agreement of 10 May 1995</u>
<P>

67  	The principal issue in the proceedings was, as stated above, as
to the true construction of the agreement of 10 May 1995 between
the first
plaintiff, on the one hand, and the defendant, on the other hand.  Both parties
agreed that this agreement had to be construed
in the context of the relevant
surrounding circumstances, including the events which led up to it, and, in
particular, in the context
of the fact that the agreement of 10 May 1995 was
preceded by correspondence and discussions between the parties and by certain
draft
agreements as well as by the agreement dated 16 May 1994 between the
first plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

<u>Submissions on Behalf of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

<u>Agreement of 16 May 1994</u>
<P>

68  	It was submitted, in effect, on behalf of the plaintiffs that
the agreement of 16 May 1994 was, so far as its legal operation
was concerned,
no more than a contract dealing with the "research and development" period in
relation to the relevant product, the
Adjust-A-Shade, in the sense that that
agreement did no more than give the defendant the exclusive right for a period
of six months
to develop and "research the market potential" of the relevant
product.
<P>

69  	It was submitted that this appeared, inter alia, from the first
two lines of the agreement of 16 May 1994 which were in the
following
terms:-
<P>

<i>"This Agreement covers the initial development of the product known as
&#180;Adjust-A-Shade',  which is covered by Patent Pending
No. PM2504".</i>
<P>

70  	Emphasis was placed on the words "initial development of the
product".
<P>

71  	Reference was also made to paragraph 1 of the agreement of 16
May 1994 which was in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"It is agreed between the undersigned parties that:</i>
<P>

<i>1	An initial exclusive period of up to SIX months be given to ABL1TE to
research the market potential for the above product, after
which time an
agreement will be negotiated in accordance with paragraph 2 below."</i>
<P>

72  	In relation to this paragraph of the agreement emphasis was
placed, inter alia, upon the word "initial" and upon the words
"to research the
market potential for the above product".
<P>

73  	It was further submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that
paragraph 2 of the agreement of 16 May 1994 did not give rise to
any binding
contractual obligations upon either of the parties, having regard to the
concluding words of paragraph 1 of the agreement,
namely, "after which time
('An initial exclusive period of up to six months') an agreement will be
negotiated in accordance with
paragraph 2 below".  It was submitted on behalf
of the plaintiffs that this was no more than a statement of intention to the
effect
that, at the appropriate time, that is, after the "initial exclusive
period of up to six months", the parties would commence negotiations
for an
agreement "in accordance with paragraph 2 below".
<P>

74  	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs, in effect, that
paragraph 2 was no more than a statement of intention as to the
subject matters
that would be dealt with in the course of such negotiations and that, as such,
they had no relevant binding contractual
legal effect when the agreement of 16
May 1994 was executed.  This was said also to be supported by the words in
paragraph 2:  "ABLITE
... will require a formal agreement which sets out ...".
The reference to "a formal agreement" was said to support the view that
paragraph 2 was not the subject of a binding legal agreement as at the date of
execution of the agreement dated 16 May 1994.
<P>

75  	It was also submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that, on the
assumption that the evidence was admissible, relevant employees
of the
defendant, as well as the first plaintiff, understood the agreement of 16 May
1994 to be dealing with the "research and development"
period, and, by
implication, not to be dealing in any binding way in those parts of the
agreement of 16 May 1994, namely, paragraph
2, which were not dealing with the
"research and development" period,<b> </b>but were dealing with the subject
matters for negotiation in a formal contract thereafter. <b> </b>In my opinion,
however, direct evidence as to how the parties understood a written<b>
</b>agreement is equivalent to direct statements of intention which are not
admissible in aid of the construction of a written contract:
<b><i>Codeya
Construction Pty. </i></b><i>Ltd. v <b>State Rail Authority </b></i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%2d82%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981-82)
149 CLR 337</a> at 347-352, and I have not taken any such evidence into account.
<P>

76  	Counsel for the plaintiffs also relied upon the letter dated 25
October 1994 from Mr. Homan on behalf of the defendant to the
first plaintiff,
and referred to the heading of the said letter which was in the following
terms:-
<P>

<i>"Original Agreement between The Sunnyfield Association and Mr. Paul Cronk,
dated 16th May, 1994."</i>
<P>

77  	Counsel also referred to the body of the letter which stated
that:-
<P>

<i>'It was agreed that we would extend the expiry date of the Contract for an
extra six months, from 16th November 1994 to 16th May 1995."</i>
<P>

78  	Counsel submitted that the reference to the extension of "the
expiry date on the Contract for an extra six months" indicated
that the parties
had regarded the "Original Agreement" as otherwise expiring on 16th November
1994.  This, it was submitted, supported
the view that the agreement of the
16th May 1994 was indeed intended by the parties to be no more than a six month
agreement relating
to "research and development" of the product, and that that
agreement was not intended by paragraph 2 thereof to create further binding
legal obligations upon the parties.
<P>

<u>Agreement of 10 May 1995</u>
<P>

79  	In relation to the agreement of 10 May 1995, counsel for the
plaintiffs submission was that it should be construed as having
effect only to
extend the "research and<b> </b>development" period, (originally six months and
later extended for a further six months:  see letter dated 25 October 1994
referred
to above) for a further period of three years from 16th May 1995 to
16th May 1998.  Counsel submitted that this approach was supported
by the first
two lines of the agreement [which were identical with the first two lines of
the agreement of 16th May 1994, (except
for the patent pending number)] which
read as follows:-
<P>

<i>"This Agreement covers the initial development of the product known as
Adjust-A-Shade", which is covered by Patent Pending No.64800/94."</i>
<P>

80  	Counsel for the plaintiffs further submitted that this approach
was also supported by the terms of the next three lines of
the agreement of 10
May 1995 which were in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"It is agreed between the undersigned parties that following the initial
exclusive period, the original agreement of 6th April 1994
be amended and
extended for a further period of three years from 16th May 1995 to 16th May
1998."</i>
<P>

81  	It was submitted that "the original agreement", referred to,
mistakenly, as being "the original agreement of 6th April 1994",
should have
been referred to as "the original agreement of 16th May 1994", and that since
that original agreement of 16th  May 1994
was limited to dealing with the
"research and development period", and since it was that agreement which was by
the agreement of
10 May 1995 to be "amended and extended for a further period
of three years from 16th May 1995 to 16th May 1998", the effect of the
agreement of 10 May 1995 was only to extend<b> </b>the "research and
development period" for three years.
<P>

82  	It was submitted further that just as paragraph 2 of the
agreement of 16 May 1994<b> </b>was no more than a mere statement of the
intention of the parties which did not give rise to any binding contractual
legal obligation,
so paragraphs (a) to (e) of the agreement of 10 May 1995 was
no more than a statement of intention of the parties which did not give
rise to
any binding contractual legal obligations, notwithstanding that the agreement
of 10 May 1995 contained, at the request of
the first plaintiff, an additional
paragraph being (e) relating to the first plaintiff agreeing to indemnify the
defendant against
certain actions and claims.  Indeed, so it was submitted,
this approach was supported by the fact that Mr. Homan had told the first
plaintiff that he (Mr. Homan) would have the old or original agreement of 16
May 1994 amended to include paragraph (e), with the
result that, just as
paragraph 2 had no binding legal effect between the parties, neither did
paragraphs (a) to (e) have binding
legal effect on the parties.
<P>

83  	Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the reference in
the concluding paragraph of the agreement of 10 May 1995 to
"This initial
agreement", as well as the opening two lines of the agreement, lent support to
the view that the agreement of 10 May
1995 was limited to extending the
"research and development period" for a further period of three years.
<P>

84  	It will be observed that, as stated above, the submissions on
behalf of the plaintiffs accept that the reference in the second
paragraph of
the agreement of 10 May 1995 to "the original agreement of 6th April 1994"
should be a reference to the<b> </b>"original agreement of 16 May 1994".
<P>

85  	It will also be observed that the submissions on behalf of the
plaintiffs, if correct, would produce the result that the "initial"
"research
and development period"<b> </b>of six months, later extended for a further six
months, was extended yet further by three years when, in my opinion, there is
no evidence
to support the view that at that time a further three years of
"research and development" of the product was necessary.  Indeed,
there was
evidence to the contrary, namely, that the defendant was satisfied that the
research and development that it had already
concluded within the initial
twelve months period was sufficient for it to commence manufacture, marketing
and distribution of the
product, which it did, and in respect of which it paid
and the first plaintiff received royalties as from on or about 10 May 1995.
 It
should also be observed that the submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs also
involve the consequence that both paragraph 2 of
the agreement of 16 May 1994,
as well as paragraphs (a) to (e) of the agreement of 10 May 1995, had no
operative legal effect notwithstanding
the absence from the agreement of 10 May
1995 of the words which appear in the agreement of 16 May 1994, namely, the
words "after
which time (the initial exclusive period) an agreement will be
negotiated in accordance with paragraph (2) below".
<P>

<u>Submissions on behalf of the Defendant</u>
<P>

86  	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the meaning of the
agreement between the parties of 10 May 1995 was relatively clear,
and in the
context of its factual matrix, which factual matrix included the agreement
between the parties dated 16 May 1994, was
not doubtful.
<P>

87  	Counsel submitted that the meaning of the agreement of 16 May
1994 was quite<b> </b>clear, insofar as it was clear on its true construction
that by paragraph 1 thereof<b> </b>the first plaintiff granted to the defendant
"An initial exclusive period of up to SIX months ... to research the market
potential
for the above product" (ADJUST-A-SHADE).
<P>

88  	Further, it was submitted by counsel on behalf of the defendant
that paragraph 2 of the agreement of 16 May 1994, which was
referred to in
paragraph 1 in terms of after which time (the initial exclusive period) an
agreement will be negotiated in accordance
with paragraph 2 below", should be
construed preferably as revealing the intention of the parties to the effect
that they were agreeing
in the agreement of 16 May 1994 that after the initial
exclusive period they would, as a matter of binding legal contractual
obligation,
and after the defendant had indicated its agreement to proceed,
enter into a "formal agreement' containing the provisions set out
in paragraphs
(a) to (d) of paragraph 2 of that agreement.  It was submitted, in effect, that
this part of the agreement fell within
the second class of contracts referred
to in the decision in <i>Masters v Cameron </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 353</a> at 360-361,
comprising contracts in respect of which the parties had finally agreed on the
terms thereof and intended to be immediately
bound thereby but nevertheless
intended that the terms would be set out in a formal document to the same
effect.
<P>

89  	Counsel for the defendant submitted, in the alternative, that
paragraph 2 of the agreement of 16 May 1994 should be construed
as not
contractually legally binding upon the parties, but should be construed as
evincing an intention to the effect that after
the initial exclusive period,
and after the defendant had agreed to proceed, the parties would negotiate "a
formal agreement" dealing<b> </b>with the subject matters contained in
paragraph 2(a) to (d) of the agreement of 16 May 1994.  Counsel submitted
further that the parties
had in fact negotiated the "formal agreement"<b>
</b>referred to in the agreement of 16 May 1994, that "formal agreement' being
the agreement of 10 May 1995 which was binding as such
between the parties.
<P>

90  	Counsel for the defendant submitted in this connection that,
even if the agreement of 16 May 1994 was to be construed as limited
to the
granting of an initial exclusive period of six months for "research and
development", and even if the agreement of October
1994 was construed as
limited to the extension of that initial six month period for a further six
months, namely, from 16 November
1994 to 16 May 1995, the agreement of 10 May
1995 was plainly the formal agreement which had been negotiated between the
parties
as contemplated in paragraph 2 of the agreement of 16 May 1994, and, as
such, was binding on the parties according to its terms which
were not limited
to the extension for a further three years of the "research and development"
period of six months later extended
for a further six months.
<P>

91  	Counsel submitted that the evidence established that the
negotiations leading up to the agreement of 10 May 1995 had been extensive,
involving various meetings between the parties and draft agreements, by way of
contrast to the simplicity of the events leading up
to the extension in October
1994 of the initial period for research and development for a further six
months, which contrast made
it plain that the parties had negotiated the
agreement of 10 May 1995 as the "formal agreement" referred to in the agreement
of 16
May 1994.  Counsel also referred to the absence from the agreement of 10
May 1995 of paragraph 1 in the agreement of 16 May 1994.
<P>

92  	Counsel also referred to evidence which established that the
parties were conscious that the research and development period
was coming to
an end as at about May 1995, and that neither of the parties contemplated or
spoke about any necessity for a further
period for research and development
after 16 May 1995, let alone a further period of three years after that date
(as would have been
expected if the construction on behalf of the plaintiff
were to be accepted to the effect that the agreement of 10 May 1995 did no
more
than extend the research and development period for a three years).  Counsel
referred, inter alia, to paragraph 14 of the affidavit
of Mr. Homan who stated
that "In or about April or May 1995, as the 12 month development period came to
an end, it became apparent
to me that we would be in a position to commence
manufacturing, selling and marketing the Adjust-a- Shade".  Counsel also
referred
to paragraph 17 of the affidavit of Mr. Ferguson in which Mr. Ferguson
stated that "Towards the end of April or the beginning of
May 1995, it became
clear to me that the Adjust-a-Shade could be manufactured and marketed by
Ablite."  Counsel also referred to
paragraph 12 of the affidavit of the first
plaintiff who stated that during the meeting of 2 May 1995 Mr. Ferguson told
the first
plaintiff that "Sales seem to be increasing steadily" and that "There
is a market and the customer feedback has been very positive"
 According to the
first plaintiff he (the first plaintiff) also stated that he was "keen to
settle on a formal agreement."
<P>

93  	Counsel submitted that all this evidence was quite inconsistent
with any requirement for an additional three years research
and development.
<P>

94  	Having regard to all these considerations counsel for the
defendant submitted<b> </b>that the meaning of the agreement of 10 May 1995
was, in its context, relatively clear when read as a whole, and that that
agreement
should be construed as defining<b> </b>the original (first)
manufacturing and distribution period (being, according to paragraph (a) of
both agreements, "a fixed period
of three years with an option of three years")
to be from 16 May 1995 to 16 May 1998, upon the basis that there was no
necessity
to further extend the already once extended research and development
period beyond 16 May 1995, to which date it had been extended
by the letter
dated 25 October 1994 to the first plaintiff from Mr. Homan on behalf of the
defendant.
<P>

95  	Counsel submitted that the first two lines of the agreement of
10 May 1995 could simply be disregarded upon the basis that,
on the true
construction of the balance of the agreement, it was plain that the description
of it as contained in the first two lines
as an agreement covering "the initial
or development of the product" was simply wrong because, on its true
construction, the agreement
of 10 May 1995 was not an agreement covering "the
initial development of the product".  Those words were not, in any event, words
of contract but merely descriptive words and as such could be ignored.
<P>

96  	Counsel also referred to the second three lines of the agreement
of 10 May 1995 which read as follows:-
<P>

<i>"It is agreed between the undersigned parties that following the initial
exclusive period, the original agreement of 6 April 1994
be amended and
extended for a further period of three years from 16th May 1995 to 16th  May
1998".</i>
<P>

97  	Counsel submitted that in a context in which it is plain that
the description of the original agreement as being "of 6th April
1994" was an
error, because it should have been described as being "of 16th May 1994", and
in which it was plain that the initial
research and development period had come
or was coming to an end at the end of twelve months, and that no further period
of research
and development was necessary, the reference to the original
agreement of 16 May 1994 (erroneously referred to as the original agreement
of
6th April 1994) being amended and extended for a further period of three years
from 16th May 1995 to 16th  May 1998 must be construed
as a reference to an
extension of the date of commencement of the manufacturing and distribution
period, which in the original agreement
of 16 May 1994 was contemplated to
commence at the end of the initial period of six months ending 16th November
1994 and which initial
period, although extended for a further six months to 16
May 1995 by the letter of 25 October 1994, was not recorded on the actual
document, being the original agreement of 16 May 1994.
<P>

98  	Counsel for the defendants further submitted that paragraphs (a)
to (e) of the agreement of 10 May 1995 should be construed
as having been
intended to be binding on the parties, and to be part of the formal agreement
envisaged in the agreement of 16 May
1994.  In this connection counsel drew
attention to the absence of any words of conditionality contained in the
agreement of 10 May
1995 as compared with the presence of such words of
conditionality in the agreement of 16 May 1994, being the words in paragraph
2
of that agreement, namely, "And subject to an agreement to proceed will require
a formal agreement which sets out ...".
<P>

99  	Counsel also submitted that paragraphs (a) to (e) in the
agreement of 10 May 1995 could not be regarded as mere surplusage
in a contract
which dealt with the initial research and development period<b> </b>to which
paragraphs (a) to (e) were not directly relevant.
<P>

100  	Counsel also drew attention to the use in the agreement of 10
May 1995 of the word "amended" in relation to "the original
agreement" (of 16
May 1994) which in its original form implied that the manufacturing and
distribution period would commence from
16 November 1994 contrary to what was
now being agreed in the agreement of 10 May 1995, namely, commencement of that
period on 16
May 1995.
<P>

<u>Decision as to the Construction of the Agreement of 10 May 1995</u>
<P>

101  	In my opinion the submissions in relation to the construction
of the agreement between the parties of 10 May 1995 made on
behalf of the
defendant are generally correct and should be accepted.  In my opinion, the
agreement of 10 May 1995 should be read
as a whole in the surrounding
circumstances in which it came into existence, including but not limited to the
agreement of 16 May
1994.
<P>

102  	Those surrounding circumstances include the letter of 25
October 1994 to the first plaintiff from the defendant, and, most
importantly,
the fact that the evidence is to the effect that as at about 2 May 1995 the
research and development period had come
or was coming to an end, and there was
no suggestion by any party to the effect that at a time a further <u>three
years</u> research and development would be necessary before the manufacturing
and distribution period of the product could begin.
<P>

103  	Accordingly, in my opinion, the agreement of 10 May 1995 should
be construed<b> </b>as providing that the initial exclusive manufacturing and
distribution period granted by the first plaintiff to the defendant was
the
period of three years from 16 May 1995 to 16 May 1998, and that the provisions
of paragraphs (a) to (e) of that agreement including
the three years option
period, were operative as from 10 May 1995.
<P>

104  	In my opinion, when so construed in the context of all the
relevant surrounding circumstances, it is plain that the description
in the
first two lines of the agreement of 10 May 1995 that it "covers the initial
development of the product" is simply an incorrect
description of that
agreement which appeared in that agreement by mistake, resulting no doubt, from
the use of a word processor,
and that those words should for that reason be
disregarded, having regard also to the fact that, in any event, they are merely
words
of description rather than words of contract in a contract drafted by
laymen rather than lawyers.
<P>

105  	In relation to the second paragraph comprising three lines of
the agreement of 10 May 1995 I am, as stated above, of the opinion
that they
should be construed as amending the initial three year period for manufacturing
and distribution contemplated by the original
agreement of 16 May 1994 as
commencing on 16 November 1994 so as to commence on 16 May 1995 principally
because, as stated above,
as at early May 1995, it appears to have been
accepted on all sides that the research and development period had come to an
end,
and certainly no-one contemplated or suggested that a further three years
research and development was required.  The reference in
the agreement of 10
May 1995 to amendment of the original agreement should, in my opinion, be
understood and construed in all the
relevant circumstances as referring to the
amendment of the original agreement of 16 May 1995 which provided for an
initial research
and development period of<b> </b>up to six months expiring on
16 November 1995, which although extended by the<b> </b>letter dated 25 October
1994, was not actually implemented by amending the original copy of the
original agreement of 16 May 1994.
 In other words, in my opinion, the effect
of the second three line paragraph of the agreement of 10 May 1995 is to make
it clear
that the initial manufacturing and distribution period of three years
was to commence on 16 May 1995 and not on 16 November 1994
as would have been
contemplated by the terms of the agreement of 16 May 1994 had that agreement
not been agreed to be amended in
accordance with the letter of 25 October
1994.
<P>

106  	In this connection I also note that recital B in the agreement
of 30 October 1996, to which the first and third plaintiffs
and the defendant
are parties, is in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"B.	Paul Andrew Cronk, in an agreement dated 2 May 1995 (but signed on 10
May 1995) authorised Ablite Industries to </i><cite>exclusively manufacture and
distribute</cite><i> the invention within Australia and New Zealand..." (words
in brackets and underlining supplied).</i>
<P>

107  	I am further of the opinion that paragraphs (a) to (e) of the
agreement of 10 May 1995 were intended by the parties in the
relevant context
to be, and are, binding upon the parties as from the date of execution of that
agreement, having regard principally,
inter alia, to the fact that they
obviously come as to paragraphs (a) to (d) from the agreement of 16 May 1994,
which in paragraph
1 contemplated an agreement to be negotiated in accordance
with paragraph 2 of that agreement which provided that, subject to the
defendant's agreement to proceed, the defendant<b> </b>would require a formal
agreement setting out paragraphs (a) to (d), which are the same as paragraphs
(a) to (d) of the agreement of
10 May 1995.
<P>

108  	It is plain, in my opinion, that, in all the circumstances, the
agreement of 10 May 1995 was the formal agreement referred
to in paragraph 2 of
the agreement of 16 May 1994 for the reasons referred to above, but also having
regard to the absence from the
agreement of 2 May 1995 of what counsel for the
defendant described as the words of conditionality contained in the agreement
of
16 May 1994, being the words that the defendant, subject to an agreement to
proceed, (would) require a formal agreement which sets
out the matter contained
in paragraphs (a) to (d). Paragraph (e) in the agreement of 10 May 1995 was
simply inserted by agreement
but at the request of the first plaintiff.
<P>

109  	It also follows from the foregoing that I reject the plaintif's
submission to the effect that the agreement of 10 May 1995
is void for
uncertainty.
<P>

110  	I note for completeness that in support of this submission
counsel for the plaintiffs relied, inter alia, upon the following
passages
contained in the judgment of Sugerman P in <i>Hammond v Vam Ltd. </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%202%20NSWLR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 2
NSWLR 16</a> at 17ff.-
<P>

<i>"This appeal involves a question which sometimes arises when the terms in
which an instrument, or part of an instrument, are, to put
it broadly, not
expressed as clearly and precisely as they might be.  The question which then
sometimes arises is whether the difficulty
thus occasioned is one which may be
resolved as a matter of the construction of the instrument, or part, in its
application to circumstances
which arise under it, or whether the lack of
certainty or precision in its terms has reached the point at which it must be
said that
the instrument, or part, is so lacking in certainty of meaning that
it is incapable of enforcement, in which event, if the instrument
takes the
form of a contract (as in the present instance), it is commonly described as a
'void' contract and regarded as<b> </b>incapable of legal effect, a disability
which, unless some measure of severance is possible, may extend to the whole
instrument,<b> </b>even though the uncertainty exists only in part of it
...</i>
<P>

<i>The courts are always loath to hold a clause invalid for uncertainty if a
reasonable meaning can be given to it.  Their duty is to
put a fair meaning
upon it, unless this is utterly impossible, and not, as has been said 'to
repose on the easy pillow of saying
that the whole is void for uncertainty' ...
'the point is one of uncertainty of concept.  If it is impossible, on
construction of
the condition, to reach a conclusion as to what was in the
draftsman's mind, the condition is meaningless and must be read as pro
non
scripto'...</i>
<P>

<i>In relation to commercial contracts 'the problem for a court of construction
must always be so to balance matters that, without violation
of essential
principle, the dealings of men may as far as possible be treated as effective,
and that the law may not incur the reproach
of being the destroyer of bargains'
...</i>
<P>

<i>Finally, before coming to the facts of the present case, I should refer to
what was said by Barwick CJ in Upper Hunter County District
Council v
Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Ltd:-</i>
<P>

<i>'But a contract of which there can be more than one possible meaning or
which when construed can produce in its application more than
one result is not
therefore void for uncertainty.  As long as it is capable of a meaning, it will
ultimately bear the meaning which
the courts, or in an appropriate case, an
arbitrator, decides is its proper construction; and the court or arbitrator
will decide
its application.  The question becomes one of construction, of
ascertaining the intention of the parties ... So long as the language
employed
by the parties ... is not 'so obscure and so incapable of any definite or
precise meaning that the Court is unable to attribute
to the parties any
particular contractual intention', the contract cannot be held to be void or
uncertain or meaningless.  In the
search for that intention, no narrow or
pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of commercial
arrangements.  Thus
will uncertainty of meaning, as distinct from absence of
meaning or of intention, be resolved.'"</i>
<P>

111  	In my opinion, however, the application of these principles to
the facts of the present case, leads to the conclusion stated
above, namely,
that the<b> </b>agreement of 10 May 1995 is not void for uncertainty.

<u>Submissions on Behalf of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

112  	Various submissions were made on behalf of the plaintiffs in
relation to the claims of the plaintiffs against the defendant
under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></i> as set out in paragraphs 28-31 of the amended

<P>

<i>"28.	Further, and/or in the alternative the Plaintiffs repeat paragraphs 6

that such formal agreement would be the basis of the on-going commercial

<P>

<i>29.	The representations referred to in paragraph 28 above were made by the

the Defendant whilst
the Defendant was engaged in trade and/or commerce ...</i>
<P>

<i>30.	The representations contained within the documents augmented and/or

<P>

113  	The submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff in relation to
the alleged representations were, by reason of the terms of
paragraph 28 of the
amended<b> </b>statement of claim, necessarily predicated upon the basis that
no formal agreement as described in paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of
the
documents dated 6th April 1994 (16 May 1994) and 16th May 1995 (10 May 1995)
had ever come<b> </b>into existence.  As, however, I have found, as stated
above, that such a formal agreement did come into existence, being the
agreement
of 10 May 1995, which formal agreement did and does form the basis of
the on-going and future commercial relationship between the
first plaintiff and
the defendant (see paragraph 28 of the amended statement of claim), it follows
that those submissions on behalf
of the plaintiffs must be rejected.
<P>

114  	It may be noted, however, that in this connection counsel for
the plaintiffs submitted, inter alia, that a principal source
of the alleged
misleading representation to the effect that it was represented to the first
plaintiff "that a formal agreement as
described in paragraph 1 and paragraph 2
of the documents dated 6th April 1994 (16 May 1994) and 16th May 1995 (10 May
1995) (would
be negotiated) and that such formal agreement would be the basis
of the ongoing commercial relationship between the First Plaintiff
and the
defendant", was the agreement of 10 May 1995 itself.  This was said to be the
case because, inter alia, the agreement of
10 May 1995 commenced with two lines
which described the agreement as covering "the initial development of the
product", whereas
such words would not have been used if it were the case, that
the agreement of 10 May 1995 related to the original term of three
years of the
manufacturing and distribution period in respect of the product, and to the
three years option in respect thereof. 
In my opinion, however, notwithstanding
the use of those words, the agreement of 10 May 1995 was not misleading having
regard to
the circumstances which led up to it and, in particular, the use of
those words, and indeed the use<b> </b>of all the words of the agreement would
not have misled the first defendant, having regard to his central role in those
circumstances,
including the circumstance that the final document of 10 May
1995 had, in the course of various discussions, gone through various
drafts
containing those words which had been passed between the first plaintiff and
the defendant. In all the circumstances, I am,
on the evidence, firmly of the
opinion that the first plaintiff well knew that the parties were at this time
negotiating the formal
agreement referred to in the original agreement of 16
May 1994 and not just negotiating a three year extension of the research and
development period.  I am further of the opinion that nothing that was said in
this connection by any of the officers of the defendant
was misleading or
likely to mislead.
<P>

115  	It was further submitted that the agreement of 10 May 1995 was
itself misleading according to its terms having regard also
to the second
paragraph thereof containing three lines in which reference is made to the
"original agreement of 6th April 1994" whereas
no such agreement existed, it
being accepted that the only relevant "original" agreement was that of 16 May
1994.  I am satisfied
that in this connection also the defendant, through its
officers, was not guilty of any misleading conduct and that, in any event,
the
first plaintiff was not misled in any material way by this consideration, nor
is there any evidence that the first plaintiff
believed otherwise and would not
have signed the agreement had he known that the original agreement being
referred to was that of
16 May 1994 rather than<b> </b>some earlier draft of
that agreement bearing date 6 April 1994.
<P>

116  	The overall thrust of the submissions made on behalf of the
plaintiffs in this connection were, as I understood them, to the
effect that
the terms of the agreement of 10 May 1995 and the conversations surrounding it
prior to its execution produced the result
that the terms of the agreement of
10 May 1995 represented itself, and further that it was represented by the
officers of the defendant
to be, an agreement extending the research and
development period for a further three years, whereas in fact it was an
agreement
defining the initial three year period of the manufacturing and
distribution period.  In my opinion, a reasonable person standing
in the shoes
of the first plaintiff in all the relevant circumstances would not have been
misled by the terms of the agreement, nor
by anything that the officers of the
defendant, said about it, into believing that it was limited to dealing with
the research and
development period, whereas in fact it dealt with the initial
manufacturing and distribution period of three years.  Further, in
my opinion,
the defendant through its officers was not guilty of any misleading conduct in
relation to anything they said about the
agreement of 10 May 1995 including
anything that was said concerning the three years option.  I am satisfied that
having regard to
the discussions which preceded it, at the time of the signing
by the first plaintiff of the agreement of 10 May 1995, he had an adequate
understanding of what an option was.
<P>

117  	In this connection and generally I prefer the evidence of the
officers of the defendant as to what was said in the course
of the events
leading up to the execution of the agreement of 10 May 1995 to the evidence of
the first plaintiff.  In my opinion,
all of the officers of the defendant who
gave evidence were using their<b> </b>best endeavours to recollect what
happened and to give evidence truthfully and<b> </b>without regard as to
whether or not what they were saying in evidence was or was not helpful to the
defendant's case.  Moreover, their
evidence was, in my opinion, in general,
consistent with the surrounding circumstances and with the probabilities as to
what passed
between them and the first plaintiff in the various conversations.
On the other hand, in my opinion, the evidence of the first plaintiff
appeared
to me to be given from the point of the view of a person who believed he had
been treated unjustly by the officers of the
defendant, principally, so it.
would seem, because the agreed royalties were too low, and because they were
not expressed as a percentage
of the defendant's profits, and who was
endeavouring to rectify the position by recalling the substance and sequence of
conversations
in a manner which was calculated to achieve that result.  I do
not find that this was done deliberately but rather that it was done
subconsciously, the first plaintiff having persuaded himself that the evidence
he gave was truthful because it did serve to show
how in his view he had been
misled and otherwise unjustly treated.
<P>

118  	I do not accept, for example, that when Mr. Homan said words to
the effect that he would have the "old" (original) agreement
amended to include
a provision to the effect that the first plaintiff could have access to the
records of the defendant in relation
to sales which was inserted in paragraph
(d) in the final agreement of 10 May 1995, that he was intending to convey that
the agreement
of 10 May 1995 then being negotiated was no more than a variation
or amendment of the earlier agreement of 16 May 1994 which was
limited to the
research and development period, nor that it was so understood by the first
plaintiff.  In my opinion, in the conversations
with the first plaintiff to
which Mr. Homan was a party, he (Mr. Homan) made it clear, expressly or by
implication, that the agreement
then being negotiated was the "final" or
"formal" agreement contemplated by the agreement<b> </b>of 16 May 1,994.  The
same is true, in my opinion, of what was. said by other officers of the
defendant including Mr. Ferguson and
Mr. Shepherd.
<P>

119  	Further, I do not accept the submission on behalf of the
plaintiffs to the effect that I should prefer the evidence of the
first
plaintiff to the evidence of Mr. Homan because Mr. Homan must have been in
error in relation to his evidence that he included
paragraph (d) in the final
agreement of 10 May 1995 without discussing the matter with either Mr. Shepherd
or Mr. Ferguson, and also
in relation to the fact that Mr. Homan and the first
plaintiff shook hands at the conclusion of the discussion with the first
plaintiff
of 2 May 1995, whereas it was more probable that this would have
occurred at the time of the signing of the agreement of 10 May 1995,
namely, on
10 May 1995.  I accept the evidence of Mr. Homan in these respects and I do not
find it improbable, having regard to his
evidence, that he considered that the
content of paragraph (d) in the final agreement of 10 May 1995 was reasonable
and not of sufficient
importance to require it to be checked with Mr. Shepherd
or Mr. Ferguson.  I also do not find it improbable that Mr. Homan and the
first
plaintiff would have shaken hands at the conclusion of the discussion on 2 May
1995, by which time agreement had been reached
between the parties on all the
terms of the proposed formal agreement and notwithstanding that Mr. Homan in
effect invited the first
plaintiff to seek legal advice about it if he wished
to do so.
<P>

120  	Counsel for the defendant also submitted that the first
plaintiff's evidence could not be regarded as truthful having regard
to his
evidence in relation to the reason, or one of the reasons, why the third
plaintiff decided to transfer its rights in the<b> </b>subject invention to the
first and second plaintiffs personally.  This was done at a time when the
original manufacturing and distribution
period of three years had expired and
the third plaintiff had made it plain in correspondence that it did not propose
to honour the
exercise by the defendant of its three years option.  Counsel for
the defendant submitted that I should find that the first plaintiff
was not
telling the truth in relation to why it had been decided to assign the
invention from the third plaintiff to the first and
second plaintiffs
personally and that I should infer, contrary to the first plaintiff's evidence
that it was for taxation reasons,
that at least one of the reasons why it was
done was to avoid the obligation upon the third plaintiff to honour the
exercise by the
defendant of its three year option.
<P>

121  	Counsel for the defendant referred me to the evidence in
cross-examination of the second plaintiff in which he admitted, in
effect, that
at least one reason for the assignment was an attempt to avoid the third
plaintiff having to give to the defendant a
further three year period of
manufacturing and distribution of the product pursuant to the exercise by the
defendant of its option.
<P>

122  	That evidence included the following:-
<P>

<i>Q.	You went to Mr. Merity because you wanted to get out of the arrangement
with Sunnyfield, did you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you asked Mr. Merity for advice in relation to how to get out of that
arrangement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I wouldn't actually say how to get out of it but I would have put it more
along the lines of giving us advice on the contracts
that we had with Paul and
Sunnyfield, giving us advice throughout all the contracts that were signed
before any advice was taken
on getting out of the contract with them.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes.  And then advice was taken about how to get out of the contract, was
it not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And he suggested that you assign the rights to yourselves
personally?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	This is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that thereafter, the company would have no rights to licence to
Sunnyfield?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I suppose, yeah, if the intellectual property isn't in the company any
more, it's a partnership, but we actually went to the partnership
agreement for
tax purposes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes; but I'm asking - you said this is what Mr. Merity said and Mr.
Merity said that after the assignment Hugo &amp; Cronk Pty.
Limited would have
no rights to provide in favour of Sunnyfield?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes; correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And Mr. Merity advised you to deregister the company as soon as possible
after the assignment, did he not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.  My accountant I think advised that."</i>
<P>

123  	Counsel for the defendant submitted in effect, that the second
plaintiff's admitted reasons for the assignment must necessarily
also have been
also the first plaintiff's reasons for the assignment, having regard to their
close association including the fact
that, apparently, they saw Mr. Merity
together.
<P>

124  	The evidence of the first plaintiff in this connection included
the following questions and answers which highlight the inconsistency
between
the evidence of the first plaintiff and the evidence of the second plaintiff in
relation to this matter:-
<P>

<i>"Q.	In May 1998 the company Hugo &amp; Cronk Pty. Limited assigned or
purported to assign its interest in the adjust-a-shade to yourself
and Mr. Hugo
personally?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And why did you do that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Under the instruction of our lawyer that we should.  It was not efficient
to be a company any more and<b> </b>we were better off being a partnership,
because of tax reasons, because we were not getting much money in and, you
know, our accounting
and things could be bigger and more elaborate than our
business dealings ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you honestly say that that was the reason that you assigned the rights
to yourselves personally?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I honestly say that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And there was no other reason?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	There was no other reason for assigning the rights to yourselves
personally other than the fact that Mr. Merity said he read something
in the
paper about companies not being tax efficient?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You knew that the agreement with Sunnyfield was about to expire in May
1998, did you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you knew that Sunnyfield were asserting that they had an entitlement
to an option for another three years, did you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you decided that one way of dealing with Sunnyfield's assertion of an
option was to assign the interests from the company to
yourselves personally,
did you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, because how would that change it?  It was still with us ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You understood that if you assigned the rights to yourselves personally
you would be entitled to the interest and not the company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't see a reason - the reason why it didn't worry me, we were fully
convinced there wasn't a contract and we had written a
letter saying that
...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You were concerned that it might be seen as improper to assign the rights
to yourselves personally when you had an existing obligation
to
Sunnyfield?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did not think we had an obligation to Sunnyfield.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But you were concerned about that, were you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	1 thought about it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You thought about it because you were concerned that you might have an
obligation at law to Sunnyfield?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I had seen contract attorneys and they said that there was no
obligation</i>.
<P>

<i>Q.	Who were these contract attorneys?</i>
<P>

<i>A .	Alex Radojev.  As far as he was concerned there was no obligation.  As
far as he was concerned the contract was as we read it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And in what way did he provide that advice?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Verbally through John Merity.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you were concerned enough to think about this issue and get advice
from Mr. Radojev, were you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, we got advice from Mr. Rado/ev about the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And before that, 1 suggest to you, you were concerned about the issue of
assigning the rights to yourselves personally?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it wasn't even our idea.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Whose idea was it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, the idea was entered, was suggested by John.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And he said to you that one way of dealing with Sunnyfield's problems was
to assign the rights to yourselves personally?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, he didn't say that ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did Mr. Merity write to you in relation to the desirability of
deregistering the company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it was just discussed in his office between Jake, myself and
John."</i>
<P>

<i>(underlining supplied).</i>
<P>

125  	It is, in my opinion, inconceivable that although, in effect,
at least one of the reasons why the second plaintiff wished
the assignment to
take place from the third plaintiff to the first and second plaintiffs
personally was because he (the second defendant)
wished the company to avoid
its obligations to the defendant pursuant to the exercise of the option, that
the first plaintiff had
no such intention in mind, even as one of the reasons
why he wished the third plaintiff to assign the invention. I therefore infer
and find that the first plaintiff was less than frank with the court<b> </b>in
failing to admit that at least one of his reasons for wishing the third
plaintiff<b> </b>to assign the invention was so that the third plaintiff could
avoid its obligations to the defendant in respect of the option period
of three
years.
<P>

126  	That the first plaintiff understood the true import of the
agreement of 10 May 1995 is also made clear, in my opinion, by
the fact that,
as stated above, he had ample opportunity to consider and did consider the
terms of the proposed agreement before
it was signed and himself made
suggestions as to amendments, and by the fact that and he also had ample
opportunity to obtain legal
advice.  In my opinion, the first plaintiff was
well able to and did understand the true nature and effect of the agreement of
10
May 1995.  Indeed, in cross-examination the first plaintiff conceded that it
was necessary to get legal advice to protect his own
interests and that if he
failed to do so he was taking risks yet, having taken away the draft agreement
(which later became the agreement
of 10 May 1995) on 2 May 1995, and having
found that his legal adviser was away for two weeks, the first plaintiff signed
the agreement
without advice and without any pressures from the defendant or
otherwise as to time.
<P>

127  	It is also not to be forgotten that, as stated above, the
defendant, at the request of the first plaintiff, and with the knowledge
and
consent of the second and third plaintiffs, continued to pay royalties to the
first plaintiff after the assignment of 10 July
1996 and the agreement of 30
October 1996 in relation to the defendant's manufacture and distribution of the
subject product until
the end of May 1998 and thereafter to the third
plaintiff. 
<P>

128  	In all the circumstances, in my opinion, the first plaintiff
cannot be heard<b> </b>to claim to have been misled into believing that the
agreement of 10 May 1995 did no more than extend the research and development
period for three years from May 1995.
<P>

129  	In the light of the findings I have made it is unnecessary for
me to deal with any of the other submissions made on behalf
of the parties.
<P>

<u>Unconscionability</u>
<P>

130  	The claims of unconscionability pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">1</a> AA of
the <b><i>Trade Practices</i></b><i> <b>Act 1974</b></i><b> </b>were not argued
on behalf of the plaintiffs, and, if they had been, having regard to my
findings, they would have been dismissed.
 There is, for example, no evidence
that the first plaintiff was, relevantly, subject to any special disadvantage
of which the defendant
took advantage nor evidence of any other facts which
could constitute unconscionable conduct.
<P>

<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a></u>

131  	The claims under this Act were not argued on behalf of the
plaintiffs.  In any event the Act is not applicable:  see section
6 of the

<P>

<u>Subsequent Transactions</u>
<P>

<u>The Assignment dated 10 July 1996 from the First Plaintiff to the Third
Plaintiff (Hugo &amp; Cronk Pty. Limited)</u>
<P>

<u>The Agreement dated 30 October 1996 between the First Plaintiff, the Third
Plaintiff and the Defendant</u>
<P>

132  	The terms of each of these two agreements have been quoted
above in full and it was not submitted by any party that they should
not
operate according to their terms, namely, respectively, as an assignment by the
first plaintiff of his interest in the invention
the subject of the relevant
patent applications to the third plaintiff, and, so far as material, an
acceptance and confirmation by
both the third plaintiff<b> </b>and the
defendant of the agreement of 10 May 1995 and of the terms of that agreement as
binding upon the third plaintiff and the defendant
"as though such agreement
has (sic) been made between" the third plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

133  	Counsel for the defendant submitted that third plaintiff
affirmed and became bound by the terms of the agreement of 10 May
1995 between
the first plaintiff and the defendant, on 30 October 1996, pursuant to the
express terms of the agreement of that date
between the first plaintiff and the
defendant.
<P>

134  	This is plainly right and I do not understand that proposition
to have been disputed on behalf of the plaintiffs.
<P>

135  	I again note, as stated above, that, notwithstanding the
assignment of 10 July 1996 and the agreement of 30 October 1996,
the defendant,
with the knowledge and consent of the second and third plaintiffs, continued to
pay royalties to the first plaintiff
until the end of May 1998, after which the
royalties were paid to the third plaintiff.
<P>

<u>The Exercise on 2 February 1998 by the Defendant of Its Option</u>
<P>

136  	The terms of the letter dated 2 February 1998 from the
defendant to the third plaintiff have been quoted above in full.
<P>

137  	It was not in dispute and, in any event, I hold that, having
regard to my findings, the exercise by the defendant of its option
under the
agreement of 10 May 1995 (and the agreement of 30 October 1996) by letter dated
2 February 1998 from the defendant<b> </b>to the third plaintiff was valid and
binding upon the third plaintiff.
<P>

<u>The Assignment dated 1 May 1998</u>
<P>

138  	The terms of this assignment of the interest of the third
plaintiff in the relevant invention to the first and second plaintiffs
personally have been quoted in full above.
<P>

139  	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant, inter alia, that
the assignment of 1 May 1998 constituted a breach by the third
plaintiff of the
agreement of 10 May 1995 (and the agreement of 30 October 1996) and that in
that connection the first and second
plaintiffs personally were guilty of the
tort of wrongfully inducing the third plaintiff to breach the agreement of 10
May 1995 (and
the agreement of 30 October 1996).
<P>

140  	On one view, however, the entry by the third defendant into the
assignment of 1 May 1998 did not constitute a breach by the
third defendant of
the agreement of 10 May 1995 (or the agreement of 30 October 1996) for the
reason that on this view the grant
to the defendant pursuant to the agreement
of 10 May 1995 of the exclusive right (licence) to manufacture the relevant
product the
subject of the relevant patent applications constituted the grant
to the defendant of a proprietary interest (see <b><i>Vitamins Australia
Limited v Beta-Carotene Industries Pty Limited</i></b><i>: </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20IPR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 9 IPR 41)</a>
which was unaffected by the assignment of 1 May 1998.  The result is, on this
view, that the interest in the relevant invention,
the subject of the relevant
patent applications, acquired by the first and second plaintiffs personally
pursuant to the assignment
of 1 May 1998 was subject to, and not in derogation
of, the rights of the defendant as exclusive licensee pursuant to the
agreement<b> </b>of 10 May 1995 (and the agreement of 30 October 1996).
<P>

141  	Alternatively, if this were not the case, as appears to be
suggested by what French J said in <b><i>Uprising Dragon Ltd. v Benedict
Trading &amp; Shipping Pty. Ltd</i></b><i>. </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 93</a> (and cf. the

effective, contrary to the view referred to above, to destroy or modify in some
way the rights
of the defendant as exclusive licensee pursuant to the agreement
of 10 May 1995 (and the agreement of 30 October 1996), the first
and second
plaintiffs would, in my opinion, having knowledge of all the relevant facts,
have been guilty of the tort of wrongfully
inducing the third plaintiff to
breach its contract with the defendant, being the agreement of 30 October 1996,
it being plain that
all the elements of that tort were present in the case of,
inter alia, the first and second plaintiffs: see e.g.<b> <i>Independent Oil
Industries Ltd. v The Shell Co. of Australia Ltd</i></b><i>. </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2037%20SR%28NSW%29%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 37

<P>

142  	The breach of contract by the third plaintiff induced by the
first and second plaintiffs was a breach of the implied term
implied in the
agreement of 30 October 1996 (and the grant of 10 May 1995) to the effect that
the third plaintiff would not act in
the relevant circumstances in any way
which would result in any derogation from the rights of the defendant under
those agreements:
 see <b><i>Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail
Authority</i></b><i>, supra, </i>at 345-347.  Moreover, in my opinion, the
defendant would be entitled to an injunction restraining the first and second
plaintiffs
from acting in furtherance of that wrongful conduct:<b> <i>Woolley
v</i> <i>Dunford </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%203%20SASR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 3 SASR 243</a>, 297, for example, by executing or
acting pursuant to or in furtherance of the license agreement such as this one
of 25 May 1998<b> </b>between<b> </b>them and Accent, or by endeavouring to
restrain the defendant from exercising its rights as exclusive licensee
pursuant to agreement
of 10 May 1995 (and the agreement of 30 October 1996.  On
this basis the defendant would also be liable in damages to the defendant.
<P>

<u>The Licence Agreement of 25 May 1998 with Accent Hydroponics Pty.
Limited</u>
<P>

143  	By this agreement, the terms of which have been quoted above,
the first and second plaintiffs to grant an exclusive licence
to manufacture
the relevant product to Accent Hydroponics Pty. Limited ("Accent").  Accent
admitted the signing of this agreement
and the manufacture, distribution and
sale of approximately 250 of the relevant products, after which, as stated
earlier, it ceased
manufacture pending the outcome of these proceedings.
<P>

144  	On the first view referred to above, this agreement was
ineffective to grant such a licence to Accent for the reason that
such a
licence in respect of the relevant product had already been granted to the
defendant, with the result that, for the reasons
referred to earlier, the
interest of the first and second plaintiffs in the invention was an interest
subject to the pre-existing
proprietary rights of the defendant as exclusive
licensee.  In those circumstances any attempt by the first and second
plaintiffs
to grant a second exclusive licence would necessarily be legally
ineffective in the sense that neither the first and second plaintiffs,
nor the
second alleged exclusive licensee, would be entitled to restrain the defendant
from exercising its rights as (the first)
exclusive licensee.
<P>

145  	Alternatively, if, contrary to this view, the grant to Accent
of an exclusive licence<b> </b>was effective to destroy or modify in some way
the rights of the defendant as<b> </b>exclusive licensee pursuant to the
agreement of 10 May 1995 (and 30 October 1996), then, in my opinion, that grant
was an act done
by the first and second defendants in furtherance of their
wrongful conduct in inducing the third plaintiff to commit a breach of
its
contract with the defendant by assigning its (the third plaintiffs) interest in
the relevant invention to the first and second
plaintiffs, with the consequence
that, in my opinion, the defendant is entitled to an injunction restraining the
first and second
defendants from acting pursuant to, or in furtherance of, the
licence agreement of 25 May 1998 with Accent.
<P>

146  	I am further of the opinion that, on this view, Accent also,
which had knowledge of all the relevant facts, was, in entering
into the
licence agreement of 25 May 1998 with the first and second plaintiffs, guilty
of the tort of wrongfully inducing the first
and second defendants to commit a
breach of their contracts with the defendant (being the agreements of 10 May
1995 and 30 October
1996), because the entry by the first and second plaintiffs
into the licence of 25 May 1998 with Accent was, as Accent well knew,
an act
done by the first and second plaintiffs in furtherance of their wrongful
conduct in inducing the third plaintiff to commit
a breach of its agreements
with the defendant.
<P>

147  	In those circumstances, the defendant is, in my opinion,
entitled to an injunction restraining Accent from acting pursuant
to or in
furtherance of the licence agreement of 25 May 1998, as well as to damages
against Accent.
<P>

148  	I am further of the opinion that by reason of the fact that the
first plaintiff was bound by the agreement of 10 May 1995,
Accent, which, on
the pleadings and on the evidence, had knowledge of all the relevant facts,
would, in my opinion, have<b> </b>been guilty of the tort of wrongfully
inducing the first plaintiff' to breach his contract with the defendant, there
being, in my
opinion, no reason why the first plaintiff should not remain
liable under the agreement of 10 May 1995, notwithstanding the agreements
of 10
July 1996 and 30 October 1996.  In this connection I note that clause 1 of the
agreement of 30 October 1996 provides, inter
alia, that "Hugo &amp; Cronk Pty.
Limited hereby accepts and confirms the agreement dated 2 May 1995 (should be
10 May 1995) between
Paul Edward Cronk and Ablite Industries ..." (words in
brackets supplied).
<P>

149  	On this basis, also, the defendant would, in my opinion, be
entitled to an injunction against Accent, restraining it from
continuing to
manufacture the relevant product, since continuing to manufacture in such
circumstances would constitute, in effect,
a continuation by Accent of its
conduct in inducing the first plaintiff to breach his contract with the
defendant.  On this basis,
Accent would also be liable in damages to the
defendant.
<P>

<u>Estoppel</u>
<P>

150  	In the event that the agreement of 25 May 1998 between the
first and second plaintiffs and Accent, was, contrary to the first
view
expressed above, effective to destroy, or modify in some way, the rights of the
defendant as exclusive licensee pursuant to
the agreements of 10 May 1995 and
30 October 1996, I also find that, having regard to the fact that the
defendant, as stated above,
continued, at the request of the first defendant,
and with the knowledge and consent of the second and third defendants, to pay
royalties
to the first plaintiff after the agreement of 30 October 1996 came
into existence until the end of May 1998 and thereafter to the<b> </b>third
plaintiff, and to the fact that the defendant and the first, second and third
plaintiffs conducted their affairs otherwise upon
the basis that the agreements
of 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996 were valid and binding according to their
terms, the defendant and
the first, second and third plaintiffs conducted their
affairs on the basis that those agreements of 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996
were valid and binding according to their terms.
<P>

151  	In my opinion, by reason of these matters the first, second and
third plaintiffs are, in the event referred to above, relevantly
estopped from
denying that those agreements of 10 May 1995 and 30 October 1996 remain valid
and binding according to their terms
by asserting, in effect, that the
assignment of 1 May 1998 and the agreement of 25 May 1998 are operative to
defeat the rights of
the defendant pursuant to those agreements because the
agreement of 10 May 1995, contrary to what I have held, operated only to extend
the research and development period for the relevant product for three years or
for any other reason: see <b><i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd. v Maher
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988) 164 CLR 387</a>; <b><i>The Commonwealth v Verwayen
</i></b>(1990) 170 CLR 394.
<P>

<u>Costs</u>
<P>

152  	The defendant has submitted that if it is successful in the
proceedings, as it has been, that its costs of the proceedings,
including the
cross-claim against Accent, should be ordered to be paid by Accent, as well as
by the first, second and third plaintiffs,
having regard, in particular, inter
alia, to the fact that Accent agreed to pay the legal expenses of the first and
second plaintiffs
of, inter alia, the present proceedings up to a maximum of
$20,000.  I will hear argument on this question on a date to be arranged.
<P>

153  	In any event, however, I intend to order that the costs of the
defendant of these proceedings be paid by the first, second
and third
plaintiffs and that the costs of the cross-claimant (defendant) of the cross
claim be paid by the first, second, third
and fourth cross-defendants.
<P>

<u>Direction</u>
<P>

154  	I direct the defendant to bring in short minutes of order
giving effect to these reasons for judgment.
<P>
