<b>TUESDAY 3 AUGUST 1999 </b>
<P>

<b>4118/97	JUDITH OLGA JOYE, CHRISTOPHER RONALD EDWARD JOYE  v  REHUXO PTY LTD
&amp; 4 ORS</b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	These proceedings are an appeal and cross-appeal brought
against the decision of Master Macready given on Wednesday 28 October
1998.
The appeal is brought by the plaintiffs, Judith Olga Joye and Christopher
Ronald Edward Joye, the second cross-defendant, Ian
Edward Joye ("Joye") and
the third cross-defendant, Robert Eric Horsell ("Horsell").  The cross-appeal
is brought by the second and
third defendants, David Bradley and Susan Bradley
("the Bradleys").
<P>

2   	The proceedings before the Master were also in the nature
of appeals from a decision given by a Registrar on 20 May 1998. 
The Registrar
had made orders in respect of a substantial number of notices to produce and
subpoenas which had been issued in these
proceedings.  Notices of motion had
been brought by the present appellants and cross-appellants seeking the setting
aside of a number
of decisions of the Registrar.  The Master made several
orders in respect of these notices of motion.  The current appeals before
me
relate to some only of those orders.  In dealing with these appeals, it is
necessary, at this stage, to make some reference to
the dispute between the
parties and the pleadings in the case.  
<P>

3   	The plaintiffs are the wife and son, respectively, of Joye.
At all relevant times Joye was an accountant and company promoter.
 Horsell was
employed, as an accountant and company secretary in a number of companies
controlled by Joye.  The third defendant,
Susan Bradley, is the sister of Joye
and the wife of the second defendant, David Bradley.
<P>

4   	Central to the dispute between the parties is a trust
referred to as "the Susan trust".  Despite its importance, there is,
apparently, no document, such as a trust deed, evidencing its terms.  In the
pleadings it is the subject of major dispute, the plaintiffs
alleging that it
was established by Horsell on the instructions of Joye in 1983 for the benefit
of the plaintiffs, while the Bradleys
allege, in the cross-claim, that it was
established in 1977 for the benefit of Susan Bradley and her children.  
<P>

5   	It is common ground, that since 1983, the trustee of the
Susan trust has been a company known as Rehuxo Pty Ltd ("Rehuxo").
 There is
also no dispute that from 1983 until 1997 the Bradleys were the only directors
and shareholders of Rehuxo and that Horsell
was the company secretary from 1983
until March 1993.  It is asserted by Joye that the Bradleys were not intended
to have any role
in relation to Rehuxo other than to act in accordance with his
directions.  
<P>

6   	It is asserted by the plaintiffs that Joye obtained from
the Bradleys signed transfers in blank of their shares in Rehuxo and
also
signed letters of resignation of their directorships.  These were obtained and
kept by Horsell on Joye's behalf to ensure that
the Bradleys complied with his
directions in relation to Rehuxo.  
<P>

7   	The Bradleys deny that the documents were furnished for
this specific purpose.  They assert in their cross-claim that the documents
were provided solely to enable Joye to undertake on their behalf, from time to
time, dealings in company shares other than Rehuxo.
 They allege that Joye
acted as their adviser in relation to financial matters, that he had fiduciary
obligations to them, and that
his attempted use of these documents to remove
them from the control of Rehuxo was a breach of those fiduciary obligations.

<P>

8   	In 1997, the parties then being in dispute, Joye arranged
for the transfers to be completed by the insertion of the plaintiffs
as
transferees.  The transfers so completed were forwarded to Rehuxo for
registration.  Registration was refused.  Accordingly, the
plaintiffs seek in
these proceedings orders that the documents be registered.  They also seek
declarations that resolutions passed
for the appointment of new directors are
valid and that assets held by Rehuxo are held on trust for the plaintiffs.  
<P>

9   	Allegations are also made that during the period of their
directorship, the Bradleys, in breach of their fiduciary duties,
used funds in
Rehuxo for their own benefit.  Equitable compensation is sought in respect of
these alleged breaches.
<P>

10   	The Bradleys, for their part, deny the alleged breaches
and assert, by way of cross-claim, that the Susan trust was established
for the
benefit of Susan Bradley and her children and that they are entitled to remain
as directors and shareholders of Rehuxo. 
They allege that Joye and Horsell
have dealt improperly since 1983 with the assets of the trust without their
knowledge or consent.
In particular they allege that shares in other companies
held in trust by Rehuxo, or on Rehuxo's behalf, have been transferred by
using
transfer documents irregularly executed by Horsell at the direction of Joye and
without the authority of Rehuxo.  They allege,
in effect, that without their
knowledge or consent, Joye has used Rehuxo and its assets for his own purposes
from 1983 onwards and,
in particular, at the time when it was sought to
register transfers in favour of the plaintiffs, that he was seeking to utilise
a
portion of the trust assets for the purpose of a settlement with his wife,
Judith, in matrimonial proceedings, resulting from the
break up of their
marriage in May 1994.
<P>

11   	Joye, at all relevant times, used as his stockbroker,
County Natwest Securities Australia Ltd ("County").  That company had
a nominee
company used in its business on its clients' behalf.  This company was Bowyang
Nominees Pty Ltd ("Bowyang"), which is the
fourth defendant in these
proceedings.
<P>

12   	It is convenient to refer, also, at this stage, to the
company, Asian Properties Ltd ("APL").  This company is listed in New
Zealand.
It was formerly called Coronet Far East Ltd and was a company in the Coronet
group of companies in which Joye had substantial
interests and which,
apparently, he controlled.  From time to time shares were held by Bowyang in
trust for Rehuxo and the Susan
trust at the direction of Joye and Horsell.
<P>

13   	Prior to September 1997, the principal asset of the Susan
trust was a shareholding of 3.15 million shares in APL.  In that
month a
capital reduction was undertaken which resulted in the Susan trust's principal
asset being the proceeds of the reduction.
 These amounted to approximately
$3.8 million.
<P>

14   	The pleadings in the matter are lengthy and complex.  They
clearly raise issues as to the identity of the beneficiaries in,
and the terms
of, the Susan trust.  Issues are also raised as to whether Joye, through
Horsell, caused shares to be removed from
the assets of the trust and used for
other purposes without the knowledge and consent of the Bradleys as the
directors and shareholders
of Rehuxo.  There is also a related but distinct
issue as to Joye, by way of unauthorised dealings with shares held by Bowyang
as
nominee for Rehuxo as trustee of the trust, caused such shares to be
diverted to his wife, the first plaintiff, in part fulfilment
of the terms of
the divorce settlement. 
<P>

15   	There is also a dispute as to whether movements of assets
in and out of the Susan trust occurred without the knowledge and
consent of the
Bradleys, in circumstances where they seek indemnity from Joye and Horsell,
should it be asserted that these dealings
involved any breach of fiduciary
obligations, on the part of the Bradleys as directors of Rehuxo.
<P>

16   	Against this background I turn to consider the notices of
motion, the subject of the Master's decision and of this appeal.
<P>

17   	It is convenient to consider, in the first place, notices
of motion issued on behalf of Joye seeking to set aside a notice
to produce
served by the Bradleys on Bowyang and a subpoena in identical terms served upon
County.  The relevant notices of motion
were upheld by both the Registrar and
the Master.  Both the notice to produce and the subpoena were ultimately set
aside as being
too wide.  There were, however, two preliminary issues for
decision.  The first was whether the notice to produce and subpoena were
issued
in breach of Pt 23 r 3 of the Supreme Court Rules.  The second was whether Joye
had standing to seek the setting aside of
the notice to produce and the
subpeona.
<P>

18   	Both the Registrar and the Master found that Pt 23 r 3 did
not preclude the issuing of the notice to produce and the subpoena.
 Each,
also, found that Joye had standing to bring the notices of motion.  Both these
questions were raised again in the appeal.
<P>

19   	As to the first I am satisfied that the Registrar and the
Master were correct in holding that Pt 23 r 3 did not have the operation
contended for.  It was asserted that since the proceedings had been commenced
after 1 October 1996, Pt 23 r 3 applied and required
that the process should
seek the production of specified documents clearly identified and also that the
number of such documents
should not exceed fifty.  Pt 23 introduced a new
regime for discovery.  However, no alteration was made to Pt 36 r 16 pursuant
to
which the notice to produce was issued.  
<P>

20   	The Master dealt with the question as follows :
<P>

"Part 36 Rule 16 is directed a different matter, namely, the use of the
equivalent of a subpoena where a party requires production
of documents at a
trial or, with leave of Court, on any earlier day before some person appointed.
 The rule involves the Court in
the process whereas the production under Part
23 is merely inter-parties' production.  In the present case the Notice to
Produce
is in accordance with is (sic) Form 45 which form is said to be for the
purposes of Part 36 Rule 16.
<P>

	There may well be force in the submission that the use of the Notice to
Produce procedure provided for in Part 36 Rule 16 might
lead to an abuse of the
procedures in Part 23.  However, on the rules as they presently stand, they are
different procedures and
there was no change to Part 36 Rule 16 when the new
provisions of Part 23 were introduced.  It seems to me that this is more a
matter
for consideration by the Rule Committee if it appears that Part 36 Rule
16 is becoming the subject of abuse."
<P>

21   	I consider that the Master's reasoning is correct.
Accordingly, the notice to produce should not be set aside on this ground.
 I
should add that the discovery procedure has not been used in these proceedings.
It appears that the notice to produce procedure
was utilised instead, on the
basis that the parties accepted that this would lead to a more expeditious
disposal of the proceedings.
 It seems to have been accepted that arguments
based upon the inappropriateness of using a notice to effect a form of
discovery would
not be relied upon.
<P>

22   	On the question of Joye's standing to seek the setting
aside of the notice to produce and the subpoena, it may be noted that
neither
Bowyang, nor County, sought to set aside the notice or the subpeona.  I am
advised that Bowyang has produced to the Court
all documents sought in the
notice; likewise County.  Neither has claimed that the process is oppressive to
them, nor that they have
been unable to ascertain, from the terms of the notice
to produce and the subpoena, the documents which they are required to produce.
However, it was held by both the Registrar and the Master that Joye had
standing to seek the setting aside of the notice and the
subpoena; this was,
apparently, on the basis that the terms of those documents were too wide in
that they required the production
of documents irrelevant to the proceedings in
that, although they were not necessarily transactions by him or on his behalf,
they
were not necessarily transactions involving Rehuxo.
<P>

23   	The relevant rule relating to the setting aside of
subpoenas is Pt 37 r 8.  It provides as follows:
<P>

"The Court may, of its own motion or on the motion of any person having a
sufficient interest, set aside the subpoena wholly or
in part."
<P>

24   	This rule was considered by McLelland J in <b>Compsyd Pty
Ltd v Streamline Travel Service Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20648" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 648</a> (at  649) where
his Honour said:
<P>

     "That rule, by its terms, does not confine standing to make such an
application to the person to whom the subpoena is directed;
all that is
required is that the moving party have a sufficient interest.  On the other
hand, I do not think that the mere fact that
the moving party is a party to the
proceedings necessarily establishes a sufficient interest in having the
subpoena set aside.  It
would all depend on what interest existed, in fact, in
the moving party in relation to the documents which the subpoena required
to be
produced.  If, for instance, the documents were documents in which the moving
party had a proprietary interest or if the documents
contained information
which the moving party claimed to be confidential to it, then, in my view,
either of those situations would
provide a sufficient interest to justify an
application to set aside the subpoena.  Another example is the very situation
illustrated
by the case <i>R v Lewes Justices </i>where the Crown, obviously,
had a sufficient interest in seeking to set aside a subpoena addressed to
someone else on the basis of
public interest privilege in the contents of the
documents sought to be produced.  So I do not think that this application can
be
disposed of on the ground of standing without an examination of the
connection, if any, between the documents sought to be required
to be produced
by the subpoenas in question on the one hand, and the defendants on the
other."
<P>

25   	I agree with the Master that these principles are
applicable to a situation where a notice to produce is served on a party
to the
litigation by another party and a third party to the same litigation seeks to
set it aside.  A notice to produce between parties
operates as a subpoena and
the same principles should apply to it.  I also agree that the fact that the
documents have already been
produced to the Court and are in the Court's
custody should not preclude the bringing of this application prior to access
being granted.
 
<P>

26   	Is it appropriate, however, that standing be accorded to
Joye simply on the basis that it is asserted, by way of submission,
that the
notice to produce and subpoena relate to, in part, documents which he asserts
can have no relevance to the issues in the
proceedings?  It is to be noted that
Joye has not provided any evidence as to the nature of the documents asserted
to be irrelevant
nor as to his "interest" in their not being produced to the
Court.  Although the question of proprietary interest or confidentiality
referred to by McLelland J are, no doubt, not exhaustive as heads of
"interest", they would be bases upon which Joye could assert
a sufficient
interest to have the process set aside.  He has provided no evidence to this
effect.  Moreover, the assertion of irrelevance
appears to me to be one that
can only be satisfactorily determined by a consideration of particular
documents in respect of which
the claim is made. This appears to be a matter
which falls for determination at a later stage.  Nor has any attempt been made
by
Joye to separate out documents, the production of which would affect some
"interest" of his, which would militate against their production
to the Court.
In my view, Joye has not demonstrated standing to seek to set aside the notice
to produce or the subpoena.  
<P>

27   	Should I be wrong in this, I should add that I am also of
the view that the terms of the notice to produce and the subpoena
are not too
wide.  Each document requires production of the following:
<P>

"1.	All records, however compiled, recorded or stored recording or relating
to:
<P>

(a)	the purchase, sale, transfer or holding of shares in Asian Properties
Limited (formerly Coronet Far East Limited) ("the Company")
by, to or from
Bowyang Nominees Pty Limited;  
<P>

(b)	the identity of the parties on whose behalf Bowyang Nominees Pty Limited
purchased, sold, transferred or held shares in the
Company and the size of
their respective shareholdings in the Company 
<P>

during the period June 1983 to September 1997.
<P>

2.	All communications (including but not limited to instructions or directions
from or to Ian Edward Joye or Robert Eric Horsell
or anyone on their behalf)
relating to the purchases, sales, transfers or holdings referred to in
paragraph 1 above.
<P>

3.	All documents or communications between Bowyang Nominees Pty Ltd and any
other person relating to the submission or proposed
submission by Bowyang
Nominees Pty Ltd and/or Ian Edward Joye of any notice under New Zealand company
legislation disclosing that
Bowyang Nominees Pty Ltd or Ian Edward Joye held a
relevant interest in shares in the Company for the period June 1983 to
September
1997."
<P>

28   	The basis upon which these demands were held to be too
wide is that no mention is made in them of Rehuxo.  It is contended
on behalf
of the plaintiffs and Joye that the subpoena could extend to APL shares held by
Bowyang other than as nominee for Rehuxo.
 
<P>

29   	As a result of arguments set out in detail in the written
submissions on behalf of the Bradleys and developed at the hearing,
I have come
to the conclusion that the failure to limit the terms of the notice and the
subpoena in this way does not result in their
being too wide.
<P>

30   	There is clearly a substantial question in the case as to
what shares in APL were held by Bowyang from time to time on behalf
of Rehuxo
as trustee for the Susan trust.
<P>

31   	Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the plaintiff's statement of claim
read as follows:
<P>

"16.       (a)	The fourth defendant ("Bowyang Nominees") has held since around
1992 some 2,978,340 shares in Asian Properties Limited
("APL"), a company
listed in New Zealand, as nominee for Rehuxo as trustee for The Susan Trust.
<P>

(b)	The 2,978,340 APL shares are the principal asset of The Susan Trust.
<P>

17.	Since 1983, Ian Joye has caused Rehuxo to hold as trustee assets, including
the 2,978,340 APL shares held on its behalf by Bowyang
Nominees, intending that
they be used to benefit Judy Joye and her children."
<P>

32   	Paragraphs 37 to 40 of the Bradleys' cross-claim read as
follows:
<P>

"37.	On 1 December 1988 Joye, by his agent, Horsell, instructed Bowyang
Nominees Pty Limited ("Bowyang") to hold for Rehuxo as trustee
of the Susan
Trust 6,285,950 shares in Coronet Far East Ltd and 873,939 shares in Coronet
Equities No 2 Ltd.
<P>

<center><b>PARTICULARS </b></center>
<P>


<P>

The letter at p122 of the bundle to Mrs Bradley's affidavit is relied on ("the
bundle").
<P>

38.	On 1 December 1989 Joye, by his agent, Horsell, and one Carol Lake, an
employee of Horsell, purported to affix the seal of Rehuxo
to share transfer
forms transferring 323,000 shares in Coronet Equities NZ Ltd from Rehuxo to
Bowyang.
<P>

<center><b>PARTICULARS </b></center>
<P>


<P>

The share transfer forms at pp125 and 126 of the bundle.
<P>

39.	On 9 January 1989 Joye by his agent Horsell instructed Bowyang that
1,412,875 shares in Coronet Far East Ltd should be sold
to Neny Investments Pty
Ltd and Traikwish Pty Limited.
<P>

<center><b>PARTICULARS </b></center>
<P>


<P>

Page 124 of the bundle.
<P>

40.	On 9 June 1993 Bowyang held 3,152,888 shares on behalf of Rehuxo in the
Susan Trust.
<P>

<center><b>PARTICULARS </b></center>
<P>


<P>

Page 185 of the bundle."
<P>

33   	Paragraph 41 asserts that the Bradleys had no knowledge of
these transactions and, in particular, had no knowledge of transactions
whereby
shares held by Bowyang for Rehuxo in APL, were reduced from 6,285,950 as at 1
December 1988 to 3,152,888 as at 9 June 1993.
<P>

34   	There also appears to be no issue between the parties that
Joye and Horsell, neither directors of Rehuxo, caused these share
dealings to
be made.
<P>

35   	I have been taken in detail to the records of share
transactions which appear in tab 15 of the appeal book in these proceedings.
They show considerable numbers of shares going in and out of the Susan trust
over relevant years, those shares going into companies
described as Neny,
Traikwish and others, to which reference will be made later.  In light of these
transactions and their complexity,
I am not prepared to say that the documents
sought under this notice to produce and subpoena are obviously irrelevant, I am
not prepared
to set them aside on the basis that their terms are too wide.
Objections to access on the basis of irrelevance can be determined
at a later
stage.
<P>

36   	I should say that this view also applies in relation to
the third paragraph of these documents.  A major issue in the case
is, the
terms and beneficiaries of the Susan trust.  It is clear that if the trust
which Joye asserts in fact existed, then ss 5(1)(2)
and 6 of the relevant New
Zealand legislation would have provided him with "a relevant interest" in the
shares held by Rehuxo.  This
would have required disclosure to the stock
exchange in New Zealand if that interest, itself, or in conjunction with other
interests
resulted in his having a relevant interest of 5 per cent or more of
the voting securities in APL.  Submissions made have satisfied
me that
non-disclosure of such interest could indicate that the trust did not exist in
the way alleged by Joye.  The documents sought
would bear upon this
question.
<P>

37   	A letter from Horsell of 16 January 1990 (appeal book tab
7, p 108) refers to a transfer of 3,250,000 shares to Rehuxo as
trustee for the
Susan trust on 7 December 1989.  There is no mention of that holding in a
substantial shareholder notice of 2 January
1990 filed with the NZ Stock
Exchange.  If the shareholding was held on the trust alleged by Joye, then, it
would appear, a disclosure
of such would have been appropriate in that notice.
A failure to make such a disclosure would point towards the non-existence of
the trust in that form.  In these circumstances, I consider that the documents
sought are relevant to that issue.
<P>

38   	I, therefore, uphold the appeal in relation to this notice
and subpoena.
<P>

39   	I turn then to complaints made by the plaintiffs, Joye and
Horsell in relation to the decision of the Master concerning notices
to produce
given by the Bradleys to Joye and to Horsell, dated 25 November 1997.  It is
submitted that the Master erred in failing
to strike out paragraphs 8(a) to (d)
and (f) to (i) in the notice given to Joye and paragraphs 5(a) to (d) and (f)
to (i) in the
notice to Horsell.  The paragraphs are in identical terms and
read as follows:
<P>

"8.	All communications, documents, financial or accounting records recording
the purchase, sale or transfer of any shares in Asian
Properties Ltd and/or
Coronet Far East Limited during the Period:
<P>

(a)	Traikwish Pty Limited;
<P>

(b)	Treskiss Pty Limited;
<P>

(c)	Hamerope Pty Limited;
<P>

(d)	Quoto Pty Limited;
<P>

...
<P>

(f)	The York Trust;
<P>

(g)	Neny Investments Pty Limited;
<P>

(h)	Zytan Pty Limited; and
<P>

(i)	Bowyang Nominees Pty Limited."
<P>

40   	These entities are all referred to in the material in
appeal book, tab 15.  This material shows extensive trading in APL shares
and
securities by the Susan trust and companies associated with Joye from 1 July
1983.  
<P>

41   	Company searches indicate that the companies, except for
Zytan, which would appear to be a nominee company, are associated
with Horsell
and Joye.  There is a clear issue in the case as to what Joye's purpose was in
dealing with assets held by or for Rehuxo
as trustee for the trust.  It is
asserted on behalf of the plaintiffs that it was his intention that Rehuxo hold
the assets for the
benefit of his wife and children.  As already indicated, it
is the Bradleys' contention that the transfer of shares in APL in and
out of
the Susan trust were effected by Joye not for the purpose of benefiting the
plaintiffs, but to confer benefits upon himself
or upon corporate entities in
which he was interested.  The material to which I have made reference, in tab
15 of the appeal book,
indicates that many of the movements of shares in APL in
and out of the Susan trust occurred contemporaneously, or nearly so, with
dealing in the shares of other companies.  Indeed there are instances where APL
shares pass directly from the trust to one of these
companies.  It is the
submission of the Bradleys that in order to achieve a true picture of Joye's
intentions in relation to the
Susan trust, its assets and alleged
beneficiaries, it is necessary to consider the whole of these transactions.
The material being
sought in the notices to produce will assist in completing
the picture and determining Joye's intentions.  It is, accordingly, relevant.
I agree with this submission and, accordingly, must respectfully disagree with
the Master's finding on this point.
<P>

42   	However, I am in agreement with him as to the basis upon
which he upheld these parts of the notices.  I concur with him in
holding that
they also go to that part of the Bradleys' cross-claim in which indemnity is
sought for dealings in trust assets by
Joye and Horsell, of which they assert
they were in ignorance.  The material, in my view, relates to their claim for
indemnity in
respect of these transactions.
<P>

43   	The next matter for consideration is the contest in
relation to paragraph 1 in the notice to produce to Joye dated 25 November
1997
and the identical material in paragraph 3 in the notice to produce to Judith
Joye of the same date.
<P>

44   	These paragraphs read as follows:
<P>

"All original or copy documents recording or being communications by you, or on
your behalf, with any of the Plaintiffs, or anyone
on their behalf, for the
period 1992 to date as to any property settlement, the provision of
maintenance, or any proposed financial
agreement to be entered into between you
and Judith Joye as a result of your divorce from her involving Rehuxo Pty
Limited ("Rehuxo")
and/or The Susan Trust and any shares held in Rehuxo."
<P>

45   	I have already referred to the fact that, in the
cross-claim, the Bradleys assert that Joye's purpose in seeking to register
the
transfers of the Bradleys' shareholdings in Rehuxo and causing their
resignation as directors, by activating their previously
signed letters to that
effect, was to enable him to give control of the assets of the trust to his
wife, as part of their settlement
under the provisions of the Family Law Act.
The Master, in upholding this part of the notice to produce, placed reliance on
a letter
sent from Mr Joye to his wife.  The relevant extract reads as
follows:
<P>

"I have shown good faith by initially transferring sole control of the Susan
Trust to you which has net assets of $4 million.  During
1996 I will tidy up
the trust and rearrange the assets so that you have $5 million cash we agreed.
Why else would I be transferring
these assets to you?"
<P>

46   	I consider that the documents sought in this part of these
notices clearly relate to the issue of fact just referred to. 
They also relate
to the broader issue of what were the terms of the trust and who were its
beneficiaries.  In relation to this part
of the Master's decision, the appeal
is rejected.
<P>

47   	There remains only the appeal against the Master's order
as to costs.  The Master's decision in this regard was a discretionary
one.  In
deciding upon the appropriate orders as to costs the Master considered that,
"[o]n the matters argued before [him] the plaintiffs
and cross defendants were
unsuccessful on the majority of the matters argued."  In the current cross
appeal the second and third
defendants have succeeded on grounds which were
rejected by the Master, whilst in comparison, the plaintiffs and cross
defendants
in this appeal have had no further success.  Had the second and
third defendants been unsuccessful in the current cross appeal before
me I am
satisfied that no basis has been shown for interference with the Master's
discretionary judgment.  However, in the current
circumstances, I consider that
order 3 of the Master's decision should be set aside and in its place that it
be ordered that the
plaintiffs and cross defendants pay the costs of the second
and third defendants of that appeal.
<P>

48   	In the result I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	The appeal be dismissed.
<P>

2.	That the appellants pay the costs of the respondents of the appeal.
<P>

3.	The cross-appeal be allowed with costs.
<P>

4.	To the extent that order 2 made by the Master on 28 October 1998 dismisses
the cross-appellant's appeal from the decision of
the Registrar of 20 May 1998
relating to the notice to produce to Bowyang and subpoena to County, that part
of order 2 be set aside.
<P>

5.	That the cross-appellants' appeal to the Master from the decision of the
Registrar of 20 May 1998 relating to the notice to produce
to Bowyang and
subpoena to County be allowed.
<P>

6.	That order 3 made by the Master on 28 October 1998 be set aside, and in lieu
thereof, order that the plaintiffs and cross defendants
pay the costs of the
second and third defendants of the appeal before the Master.
