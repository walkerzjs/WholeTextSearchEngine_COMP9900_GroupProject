<i>Tuesday, 6 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4552 of 1998	ROYAL CAPITAL PTY LIMITED  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			ACN 060 296 175 PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By summons filed on 6 November 1998 the plaintiff, Royal
Capital Pty Limited, seeks substantively an order that the statutory demand
dated 20 October 1998 claiming payment of the amount of $15,000, served upon it
by the defendant, ACN 060 296 175 Pty Limited, be
set a side.
<P>

2	By that statutory demand (exhibit A) the defendant (described therein as "ACN
060 296 175 Pty Limited (in liquidation)(formerly
Royal Group Pty Limited) ACN
060 296 175") seeks payment to it by the plaintiff of the sum of $15,000, that
sum being described in
the schedule to the demand as follows,
<P>

	Purchase of office furniture and equipment on 14 September 1998 with
instalments due
<P>

	21 September 1998  	  $5,000
<P>

	28 September 1998 	  $5,000
<P>

	5 October 1998 		  <u>$5,000</u>
<P>

				$15,000
<P>

3	The ground upon which the plaintiff seeks to have the statutory demand set
aside is that under section 459G (1) of the <i>Corporations Law, </i>in that
there is a genuine dispute as to the existence or the amount of the alleged
debt.
<P>

4	It should here be interpolated that the defendant was formerly called Royal
Group Pty Limited, and changed its name to ACN 060
296 175 Pty Limited some
time in 1998. The plaintiff and the defendant had directors in common and
shared the same premises. It should
also be noted that there is now in
existence another company called Royal Group Pty Limited --- not the defendant
--- which appears
to be associated with the plaintiff, and to have at least one
director in common with it. 
<P>

5	In September 1998 the defendant, through its director, Dr. Adrian Ong, was
desirous of appointing an administrator, in the person
of Mr Geoffrey David
McDonald, who is an official liquidator and is a member of the firm Hall
Chadwick, chartered accountants. 
<P>

6	According to Dr. Ong, he had a conversation with Mr McDonald on or about 14
September 1998 concerning the appointment of Mr McDonald
as administrator of
the defendant, and concerning Mr McDonald's fees for acting in that capacity
and the manner in which those fees
should be paid. There appears to be no
dispute that Mr McDonald estimated that his fees for the administration would
be about $20,000.
He was agreeable to the request of Dr. Ong that those fees
might be paid by instalments of $5,000. However, Mr McDonald was,
understandably,
concerned that there should be a fund available to meet his
fees if he were to be appointed administrator. 
<P>

7	It would appear that the defendant did not at that time have available, or at
least did not have readily available to it, the
sum of $20,000. Accordingly, Mr
McDonald suggested that the plaintiff, a company associated with the defendant,
having at least one
director in common (Dr. Ong), and sharing office premises
in Melbourne with the defendant, should purchase from the defendant for
the sum
of $20,000 the office equipment owned by the defendant. 
<P>

8	Mr McDonald was appointed administrator of the defendant by resolution of its
directors passed on 14 September 1998 and he thereupon
entered upon that
administration. By letter dated 17 September 1998 addressed to the plaintiff
(exhibit 4) Mr McDonald confirmed
the purchase by the plaintiff from the
defendant of the office furniture and equipment and the fact that the plaintiff
had taken
possession of that office furniture and equipment before 14 September
1998. In that letter Mr McDonald referred to the agreement
entered into by the
plaintiff with the defendant for the payment of the purchase price by
instalments, and acknowledged receipt of
the first instalment of $5,000 on 14
September 1998.
<P>

9	Subsequently there was prepared a document, entitled "Confirmation of
Agreement for Sale of Goods", the parties to which were
"ACN 060 296 175 Pty
Limited (Administrator Appointed)" (referred to therein as "ACN") and Royal
Capital Pty Limited (referred to
therein as "Royal"). That agreement was dated
18 September 1998 and was signed on behalf of the defendant by Dr. Ong as "the
director
of Royal". That document is annexure A to the affidavit of Mr McDonald
sworn 27 October 1998. 
<P>

10	Clauses 1 and 2 of that document are as follows,
<P>

	1. ACN agreed to sell to Royal all it's [<i>sic</i>] office furniture and
equipment in consideration for twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).
<P>

	2. Royal agreed to pay the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) as
consideration for the purchase of the office furniture and
equipment.
<P>

11	The remaining clauses evidence an agreement made between the parties to pay
the sum of $20,000 in four weekly instalments of
$5,000 each (clause 3); the
dates upon which the instalments are due (clause 4); and the agreement by the
defendant to give possession
of the office equipment and furniture to the
plaintiff on or before 14 September 1998 (clause 5). 
<P>

12	The first of the dates upon which an instalment was to be due under clause 4
was 14 September 1998, that date being, it will
be appreciated, some four days
before the date of the document, "Confirmation of Agreement for Sale of Goods".
Clause 4 acknowledges
that that instalment due on 14 September 1998 had already
been paid. There is no dispute between the parties that that sum of $5,000
had,
in fact, been paid by the plaintiff to the defendant pursuant to the agreement
the confirmation of which was evidenced by the
foregoing document. 
<P>

13	Subsequently, on 21 September 1998, a provisional liquidator of the
defendant was appointed. 
<P>

14	The defendant was later wound up, on 9 October 1998. The liquidator of the
defendant now seeks payment of the balance of $15,000
asserted by the defendant
to be owing to it by the plaintiff under the agreement entered into by the
defendant with the plaintiff
in the terms which were confirmed by the written
document of 18 September 1998. 
<P>

15	On about 21 September 1998 Dr. Ong telephoned the offices of Hall Chadwick,
the firm of chartered accountants of which Mr McDonald
was a partner. Mr
McDonald being unavailable, Dr. Ong spoke with one of his assistants, Miss
Katherine Nguyen. Although there is
a dispute between Dr. Ong and Miss Nguyen
concerning parts of that conversation, there is no dispute that Dr. Ong said
words to the
following effect, "I have heard that a provisional liquidator has
been appointed. I understand that Mr McDonald's appointment is
at an end. This
means that he does not need to do any more work as voluntary administrator. Is
that right?" to which Miss Nguyen
responded in the affirmative. 
<P>

16	According to Dr. Ong, he then said, "Could you tear up the document I signed
about the office equipment then?", and Miss Nguyen
said, "Yes, I will."
<P>

17	However, according to Miss Nguyen, Dr. Ong said, "Well, if he is not doing
any more work I don't want to pay any more money for
the furniture. Can you
just tear up that agreement please?" to which Miss Nguyen said, "I don't think
so. But I will have to speak
to Mr McDonald. I can't make those decisions, and
it is best to speak to Mr McDonald directly."
<P>

18	According to Dr. Ong there was never an agreement with the defendant that
the plaintiff would pay $20,000 for the defendant's
office equipment. Indeed,
Dr, Ong said that the office equipment owned by the defendant was essentially
one old filing cabinet, the
value of which was negligible. Dr. Ong also said
that in the period September - October 1998 the plaintiff and the defendant had
the same address and shared the same offices, and the office equipment was used
by both companies. 
<P>

19	It would appear that the present complaint of the plaintiff is that the
appointment of a provisional liquidator of the defendant
peremptorily (and, in
the view of the plaintiff, prematurely) put to an end the administration of the
defendant by Mr McDonald. Thus,
so it is asserted by the plaintiff, there was
no entitlement in Mr McDonald to receive payment of fees amounting to $20,000
for his
administration. 
<P>

20	That complaint, however, confuses the apparent purpose behind the agreement
into which the plaintiff and the defendant had entered
with the terms of that
agreement. 
<P>

21	It must be appreciated that Mr McDonald was not a party the agreement. The
agreement was made before Mr McDonald was prepared
to accept appointment as
administrator of the defendant. It was fully understandable that he was
prepared to accept such an appointment
only if he should be satisfied that
there was a fund available to meet his fees for the administration of the
defendant. An agreement
was thereupon entered into, not by Mr McDonald
personally with the either the plaintiff or the defendant, not by Mr McDonald
in his
capacity as administrator of the defendant --- since he had not at that
time been so appointed, and he was not prepared to accept
such an appointment
until after the agreement had been entered into by the defendant, making
available to it a fund from which Mr
McDonald's fees could ultimately be paid
--- but an agreement between two related companies, which shared a common
director, which
occupied the same premises and used the same office equipment,
and one of which companies, the present plaintiff, clearly expected
to benefit
from the appointment of an administrator to the other company, the present
defendant.
<P>

22	Not only did the two companies on about 14 September 1998 enter into that
agreement, which was an oral agreement, but the two
companies acted upon that
agreement to the extent that the plaintiff paid to the defendant on 14
September 1998 the sum of $5,000,
being the first of the four weekly
instalments, by which, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the
plaintiff was to pay
to the defendant the total sum of $20,000. 
<P>

23	It will be appreciated that the written document which was executed by Dr.
Ong on behalf of the plaintiff on 18 September 1998
did not constitute the
agreement between the parties --- that agreement had been made about four days
previously --- but evidenced
and confirmed that agreement. By the time that
that document was signed on 18 September 1998 Mr McDonald had already entered
upon
his duties as administrator of the defendant, and thus the defendant was
properly described in that document as "ACN 060 296 175
(Administrator
Appointed)". 
<P>

24	In essence, the complaint of the plaintiff appears to be that it entered
into an agreement to pay to the defendant $20,000, in
the expectation that that
amount would be used in its totality to meet Mr McDonald's fees, and that, in
consequence of the abbreviated
period in which Mr McDonald actually held the
office of administrator of the defendant, his fees did not amount to
$20,000.
<P>

25	Any apparent disappointment by the plaintiff that the administration of the
defendant by Mr McDonald was unexpectedly brought
to an end after about a week
does not seem to me to be relevant to the enforcability and efficacy of the
agreement entered into by
the plaintiff, not with Mr McDonald, but with the
defendant.
<P>

26	The arguments which have been advanced by the plaintiff against the
entitlement of the defendant to recover from the plaintiff
the outstanding
amount of $15,000 agreed upon between the plaintiff and the defendant, seem to
me to proceed upon some form of misconception
on the part of the plaintiff that
the agreement that it was entering into was an agreement between the plaintiff
and Mr McDonald.
It was no such thing. Although Mr McDonald suggested the
manner in which funds might be made available to the defendant for the payment
of his fees as administrator, it is abundantly clear that there was no
agreement between the plaintiff and Mr McDonald or between
the defendant and Mr
McDonald concerning the sale of the office equipment.
<P>

27	It does not assist the plaintiff's case, in asserting the existence of a
genuine dispute as to its indebtedness to the defendant,
for it now to say that
the office equipment which was the subject of agreement which it chose to enter
into with its associated company
was of negligible value, and consisted of one
old filing cabinet. The two companies entered into an agreement for what they
expected
to be a benefit to each of them --- that is, the appointment of an
administrator of the defendant. 
<P>

28	That appointment required either the defendant itself or some other entity
to arrange for the payment of the fees of the proposed
administrator. At the
time when that agreement was made the defendant did not have the financial
capacity to pay those fees, and
thus it was not open to it to enter into an
agreement with the proposed administrator for the payment of those fees.
Accordingly
various courses were open to the proposed administrator and other
interested parties. Either the proposed administrator could enter
into an
agreement with a third party who might offer to pay his fees --- that is, Mr
McDonald and the plaintiff could have entered
into an agreement --- or the
administrator, having embarked upon his administration, would be entitled to
realise assets of the company
in order to meet his fees. That latter course was
the course which the parties intended should be followed. But, of course, Mr
McDonald,
quite understandably, wished to be satisfied, before accepting
appointment as administrator, that the defendant had available such
assets.
That was the purpose for which he suggested to the defendant that it should
sell its office equipment to its associated company,
with which it shared the
office, so that there would thereby become available funds in the defendant to
which Mr McDonald could look
for the payment of his fees.
<P>

29	In proceedings such as the present, it is not appropriate that the Court
should attempt to resolve any disputed questions of
fact. In deciding whether
or not there is a genuine dispute as to the indebtedness of the plaintiff to
the defendant in the amount
claimed, or at all, it is appropriate that in the
present application I should proceed upon the basis of the evidence given on
behalf
of the plaintiff. Dr. Ong gave evidence by way of affidavit and was also
cross-examined. Mr McDonald also gave evidence by way of
affidavit and was also
cross-examined. 
<P>

30	Accepting for the purpose of the present proceedings the evidence of Dr. Ong
concerning his conversation with Miss Nguyen (a
conversation significant parts
of which Miss Nguyen disputes), it is clear that the request of Dr. Ong that
Miss Nguyen should "tear
up the document I signed about the office equipment"
was tantamount to an acknowledgment that an agreement was in existence, but
that Dr. Ong did not wish to be bound by that agreement because of the changed
circumstances (those changed circumstances being the
appointment of a
provisional liquidator, with the consequent termination of Mr McDonald's
appointment).
<P>

31	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the agreement entered into
was an agreement to which there were three parties,
namely, the plaintiff, the
defendant and the accounting firm of Hall Chadwick. It was submitted that the
agreement was entered into
on behalf of the plaintiff by Dr. Ong, on behalf of
the defendant by Mr McDonald and on behalf of the accounting firm by Mr
McDonald.
In the alternative, it was suggested on behalf of the plaintiff that
there were in fact, two agreements, being firstly an agreement
for the
engagement of Mr McDonald's services, and then an agreement for the purchase of
the office furniture, and that it was intended
by all the parties to those two
agreements that those agreements be regarded as interdependent, in that, so it
was submitted, it
was obvious that Dr. Ong never intended to purchase furniture
worth virtually nothing for $20,000, unless Mr McDonald's services
as
administrator were to a value of $20,000. 
<P>

32	There is no evidence whatsoever to support either of the foregoing
contentions. It is abundantly clear (even from Dr. Ong's evidence)
firstly that
there was only one agreement, that being an agreement between the two
companies. Secondly, that Mr McDonald was not
a party to that agreement, and,
indeed, could not have been a party to that agreement, since until such an
agreement had been entered
into, the defendant did not have any funds to which
Mr McDonald, when appointed administrator, could have resort for the payment
of
his fees. There was no suggestion made by the plaintiff, and indeed it would
not be possible in the circumstances of this case
for the plaintiff to make
such a suggestion, that Mr McDonald either was prepared to accept appointment
as administrator without
arrangements having been made for the payment of his
fees, or, that he was appointed administrator before the agreement between the
parties took effect and the first instalment of the purchase price had been
paid by the plaintiff to the defendants. 
<P>

33	It was then submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, that the effect of the
agreement was to confer upon the defendant the benefit
of an entitlement to the
sum of $20,000 and to confer upon the plaintiff the benefit of a single filing
cabinet of little or no commercial
value. The plaintiff asserts that in
consequence the defendant has received a benefit at the expense of the
plaintiff which was unjust,
and that the plaintiff is somehow entitled to a
claim in restitution based upon the concept of unjust enrichment. It was
submitted
that the unjust element of the transaction is to be found in the
grossly disproportionate benefits conferred upon the parties to
what was
described, quite inaccurately, as "the written agreement" (I have already
accurately categorised that document, which describes
itself as a confirmation
of an agreement already made, as evidencing and confirming the earlier oral
agreement) and in the failure
of the contemplated and significant event which
might otherwise have justified the transaction, being the continuation of Mr
McDonald's
appointment as administrator.
<P>

34	It will be appreciated that the first time when the plaintiff, through its
director Dr. Ong, suggested, at least by implication,
that the sale of the
office equipment was somehow to be treated as conditional upon the
administrator performing work to the value
of $20,000 was in the telephone call
of Dr. Ong to the offices of Hall Chadwick on or about 21 September 1998, when
he had the conversation
with Miss Nguyen to which I have already referred. That
suggestion was made not only after the original agreement between the parties
had been entered into on about 14 September 1998, not only after the written
confirmation of the agreement had been signed on 18
September 1998, but only
after the appointment of the provisional liquidator of the defendant and the
termination of Mr McDonald's
appointment. It would not have been then open to
Mr McDonald, even if he had been willing to do so, to have terminated or
otherwise
cancelled the effect of the agreement made between the two companies,
since any authority which he might have had to act on behalf
of the defendant
in his capacity as its administrator was brought to an end by the appointment
of the provisional liquidator on or
about 21 September 1998. 
<P>

35	There was no suggestion in any of the evidence adduced on behalf of the
plaintiff, being the evidence of Dr. Ong, or the evidence
given by Mr McDonald
under cross-examination, that there was any discussion either between the two
companies at the time when they
entered the agreement, or between the plaintiff
and Mr McDonald, either before his appointment as administrator of the
defendant
or after that appointment, that the outstanding instalments need be
paid only if the administrator had performed work to the value
of those
instalments. 
<P>

36	The substance of the agreement between the two companies was for payment of
$20,000 for the purchase of certain office equipment,
with provision for that
payment to be made by four instalments each of $5,000 upon certain specified
dates. Whilst the purpose of
the agreement was to enable the plaintiff to have
an asset available to which Mr McDonald as administrator could have recourse to
meet his fees, and whilst both Mr McDonald and each of the two companies might
have contemplated that the entirety of that asset
would probably be spent in
meeting those fees, those facts do not alter the liability of the plaintiff to
make the payments which
it had agreed with the defendant to make in the terms
of the oral agreement, subsequently evidenced and confirmed by the written
document dated 18 September 1998.
<P>

37	The submissions of the plaintiff grounded upon the alleged inherent
injustice of the terms of the agreement and the asserted
entitlement of the
plaintiff to restitution in accordance with the principles relating to unjust
enrichment totally disregard the
context in which the agreement was made,
including the close relationship between the companies (having at least one
director in
common, sharing premises, office furnishings and equipment, and the
fact that Dr. Ong was able, apparently acting on behalf of each
of the two
companies, to effect the agreement between the companies), and the expectation,
at least implicit in the transaction,
of some benefit to the plaintiff as a
consequence of the appointment of Mr McDonald as administrator of the
defendant. Further, it
will be appreciated that Dr. Ong at the time when he
made the agreement on behalf of the defendant and signed the document
confirming
and evidencing that agreement on 18 September, read and understood
what that document meant. He did not suggest that in entering
into the
agreement the defendant placed reliance upon anything that Mr McDonald said.
There is certainly no suggestion in Dr. Ong's
evidence that at the time he made
the agreement either he understood or Mr McDonald ever said to him that the
agreement would be
enforced only to the extent that the administrator incurred
fees. I have already referred to the fact that such a suggestion appears
to
have arisen only after the appointment of the provisional liquidator, and in
the context that Dr. Ong, at least implicitly, accepted
that the effect of the
agreement was to obligate the plaintiff to pay the outstanding balance of
$15,000 to the defendant.
<P>

38	It must also be appreciated that the agreement is between two companies. The
defendant is in liquidation and it is now, through
its liquidator, attempting
to enforce the agreement. There is no unconscionable conduct which can be
asserted against the liquidator.
In those circumstances, it does not seem to me
that the plaintiff has even laid the basis for an argument that, in effect,
there
should be <i>restitutio in integrum</i>. 
<P>

39	It should also be appreciated that if the companies and Mr McDonald had
contemplated an arrangement of the nature which the plaintiff
now asserts, ---
that the plaintiff should be liable to pay Mr McDonald's fees only to the
extent that those fees were incurred,
and that any liability of the plaintiff
should be limited, in effect, to the $5,000 already paid --- there was no
reason at all why
an agreement along those lines should have not been made
between the plaintiff and Mr McDonald, or why there should not have been
an
arrangement whereby the plaintiff, or some other entity, could have lodged the
sum of $20,000 with Mr McDonald's firm, subject
to the condition that any funds
in excess of his actual fees would be returned to the entity effecting such
lodgment.
<P>

40	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established that there is a
genuine dispute as to the existence or the amount of the
debt claimed in the
statutory demand. Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the summons.
<P>

41	I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.  I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

	2.  I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.
<P>

	3.  The exhibits may be returned.
