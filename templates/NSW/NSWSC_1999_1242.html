<P>

THE SUPREME COURT
<P>

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 16 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>11327/1999</u>	<u>SCANRUBY PTY LIMITED v CALTEX PETROLEUM PTY LIMITED &amp;
ANOR</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff and the defendant had a dispute concerning a large
service station at Wyong.  The plaintiff sought an injunction
in the Equity
Division of this Court.  The application was heard by Cohen J.  The application
was unsuccessful.
<P>

2  	On 4 September 1998, the following orders were made:-
<P>

"1.	That the Plaintiff's application for an injunction be 
<P>

refused;
<P>

2.	That for the purpose of submitting an application to 
<P>

the Court of Appeal, the injunction granted on 29 June 1998 be extended up to
and including 7 September 1998;
<P>

3.	That the Plaintiff pay the Defendants' costs of the 
<P>

Application for an injunction."
<P>

3  	Between 4 and 7 September 1998, there were inter alia
negotiations between the parties and a deed was prepared.  On 7 September
1998,
the injunction was not extended and the plaintiff did not proceed with any
appeal.
<P>

4  	The defendant gave a Bill of Costs purporting to relate to costs
payable as a result of the court order.  An application for
assessment of the
costs was made pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s202.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 202</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the
Act).  The assessment was referred to a costs assessor (Mr Cohen).  He carried
out an assessment pursuant to Subdivision 3 of
Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the
Act.  He received submissions from the parties (including a notice of objection
and a response).  He made a determination
(the Certificate of Determination
issued on 5 May 1999).
<P>

5  	The bill had been in the order of $92,000.  The effect of the
determination was to reduce the bill by sum of about $26,000.
<P>

6  	On 27 May 1999 pursuant to a request to do so, the Costs Assessor
provided reasons for  his assessment.  There is no challenge
as to the
sufficiency of the reasons.
<P>

7  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 2 June 1999.
The plaintiff seeks relief pursuant to both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208</a> M.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L</a>
enables the bringing of an appeal as to a matter of law arising in the
proceedings to determine the application for assessment. 
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> enables
the appropriate court to grant leave to appeal against the determination.
<P>

8  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L</a> provides a very narrow avenue of appeal against a
decision of a costs assessor.  It is confined to a matter of law.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a>
confers a discretionary power on the court to grant leave to appeal.  The
discretion is exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances
of the
particular case before the court and so that justice is best served between the
parties.  The plaintiff bears the onus of
demonstrating an entitlement to
relief under either of the two sections.
<P>

9  	The Summons was heard on 10 December 1999.  The evidence fell
within a small compass.  The plaintiff tendered documentation
which is referred
to in paragraph 1 of an affidavit sworn by Mr Williams.  The defendant relied
on an affidavit sworn by Mr Doble.
 Both sides have prepared written
submissions supplemented by oral argument.
<P>

10  	In substance, the plaintiff says that there has been error on
the part of the Costs Assessor (error of both law and fact) and
that the costs
allowed by the Costs Assessor should be reduced by a further sum (in the order
of $15,000).  Despite the relatively
modest amount in dispute, the proceedings
have generated great enthusiasm and a disproportionate volume of work from the
legal practitioners.
<P>

11  	The court has been referred to a number of decided cases  Many
of the cases were decided when the taxation regime had application.
 This
regime was replaced by the assessment process when the Act came into force.
For present purposes, it is not necessary to go
to any of those cases.  It
seems to me, that these proceedings can be dealt with on their own particular
facts.  
<P>

12  	The case for the plaintiff was put in the most general terms.
In making that observation, I do not mean to be critical of counsel.
 He did
the best he could with a very weak case (part of which appeared to be founded
on misconception of provisions of the Act and
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules 1970</a> (the
Rules) ).
<P>

13  	I shall do my best to recapitulate the substance of what was put
on behalf of the plaintiff.  Broadly speaking, there were
two principal aspects
to the submissions.  It was said was that the Costs Assessor erred by allowing
what have been described as
post judgment costs (reference was made to items
413 and 429 - 449).  These were said to be extraneous to the costs of the case
itself.
 These were items which related inter alia to the negotiations and the
deed.  This error was said to be an error of law.  These costs
were identified
as being in the order of about $3,500.  Further error was alleged to arise from
inconsistency in approach (he is
said to have disallowed costs because they
were not party/party costs yet has allowed costs which were the same as those
disallowed)
and allowing items which were excessive or unnecessary.  In
submissions inter alia reference was made to items 237, 245 and 456.
 As an
overall submission in relation to the matters put, it was said that there had
been error by reason of failure to allow only
what might be described as
party/party costs (which was said to be the basis recognized by the Act).  It
was further said that costs
in the nature of solicitor/client costs had been
allowed.
<P>

14  	For completeness, I should mention that although the ground
specified in the Summons was that of failing to take into account
objections,
this ground was not in fact argued.
<P>

15  	In this case, the assessment was one governed by the provisions
of Subdivision 3 of Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the Act.  The Subdivision has the
somewhat misleading heading "Assessment of party/party costs" (see <u>Turner v
Pride</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/850.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 850).</a>  The expression party/party costs does not appear
in the body of the provisions contained in Division 6.  Subdivision 3 operates
in relation to "costs payable as a result of an order made by a court or a
tribunal".  The second reading speech reveals that the
intention was to abolish
the distinction between party/party costs (those which are necessary and
proper) and solicitor/client costs
(all costs save those which are of an
unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred) and to impose a new
criterion (for
awarding those costs which are reasonably incurred).  The
intention was to remove injustice and confusion and to alleviate the problem
of
the successful litigant (who has been awarded costs) being left out of pocket
for a significant amount.
<P>

16  	The expression "party and party basis" is retained in the Rules
(Pt 52A) and is defined therein (r 2).  It means the basis
of assessment set
out in Division 6 of the Act.
<P>

17  	In determining the costs payable as the result of an order, the
Costs Assessor is required to assess the amount of the costs
that in his or her
opinion is a fair and reasonable amount (s 208F (2) ).  If the costs are
ordered to be assessed on an indemnity
basis, the Costs Assessor must assess
costs on that basis (s 208F (3) ).
<P>

18  	In my view, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate either an
error of law or an error of fact.  In my view, the complaints
raised in this
case are all referrable to questions of fact.
<P>

19  	In my view, the Costs Assessor made a determination which was
open to him in the light of the material that had been made available
to him.
I am not satisfied that any matter has been demonstrated which would justify
the granting of leave to appeal.  I am not satisfied
that the interests of
justice would be best served by the granting of such leave.
<P>

20  	It may be helpful if I make some additional observations.  The
reasons reveal that the Costs Assessor has disallowed many items
for the
reasons of either "Not Party/Party" or "Excessive" (the expression
"solicitor/client costs" does not appear).  It could be
expected that an
experienced costs assessor would be using "Party/Party" in the sense afforded
to it by the Rules.  If this is not
the case, and it has been used in its
former sense, then the plaintiff may have substantially benefited from the
application of a
less generous test (than that of reasonableness) to the
defendants' Bill of Costs.  In those circumstances one might have thought
that
the defendant may have had ground for complaint (but not the plaintiff).
<P>

21  	I dismiss the Summons.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
Summons.  The Exhibits may be returned.
