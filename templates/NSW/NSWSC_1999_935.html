<b>3669/99	DEBIS FINANCIAL SERVICES (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED v ALLIED BELLAMBI
COLLIERIES PTY LIMITED (RECEIVERS APPOINTED) (VOLUNTARY
ADMINISTRATOR
APPOINTED) &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	This matter raises for consideration the tension which may
exist and in this case does exist between the administrator of a
company in
voluntary administration and the rights of a secured creditor of the company.
The most material sections of the Corporations
Law ("the Law") are the
following:
<P>

"440B	Charge unenforceable
<P>

During the administration of a company, a person cannot enforce a charge on
property of the company, except:
<P>

(a)	with the administrator's written consent; or
<P>

(b)	with the leave of the Court.
<P>

440D	Stay of proceedings
<P>

(1)	During the administration of a company, a proceeding in a court against the
company or in relation to any of its property cannot
be begun or proceeded
with, except:
<P>

(a)	with the administrator's written consent; or
<P>

(b)	with the leave of the Court and in accordance with such terms (if any) as
the Court imposes.
<P>

......
<P>

441B	Where enforcement of charge begins before administration
<P>

(1)	This section applies if, before the beginning of the administration of a
company, a chargee, receiver or other person:
<P>

(a)	entered into possession , or assumed control, of property of the company;
or
<P>

(b)	entered into an agreement to sell such property; or
<P>

(c)	made arrangements for such property to be offered for sale by public
auction; or
<P>

(d)	publicly invited tenders for the purchase of such property; or
<P>

(e)	exercised any other power in relation to such property;
<P>

for the purpose of enforcing a charge on that property.
<P>

(2)	Nothing in section 437C or 440B prevents the chargee, receiver or other
person from enforcing the charge in relation to that
property.
<P>

......
<P>

441D	Court may limit powers of chargee, etc. in relation to charged property
<P>

(1)	This section applies if:
<P>

(a)	for the purpose of enforcing a charge on property of a company, the
chargee, or a receiver or other person, does an act of a
kind referred to in a
paragraph of subsection 441B(1); and
<P>

(b)	the company is under administration when the chargee, receiver or other
person does the act, or the company later begins to
be under administration;
......
<P>

(2)	On application by the administrator , the Court may order the chargee,
receiver or other person not to perform specified functions,
or exercise
specified powers, except as permitted by the order.
<P>

(3)	The Court may only make an order if satisfied that what the administrator
proposes to do during the administration will adequately
protect the chargee's
interests.
<P>

(4)	An order may only be made, and only has effect, during the
administration.
<P>

(5)	An order has effect despite sections 441B and 441C."
<P>

2   	Section 435C of the Law provides for the circumstances in
which a voluntary administration comes to an end.  The two ways that
are
material to this case are that it expires if a deed of company arrangement
("DCA") is executed by both the company and the deed's
administrator or if the
company contravenes s 444B(2) by failing to execute a proposed DCA within the
specified time.  After dealing
with the regime that applies while a company is
in voluntary administration, the Law passes on to deal with the regime which
comes
into force if the DCA is executed and takes effect.  Under that regime,
also, there are or may be restrictions upon the rights of
a secured creditor
and, in particular, ss 444D and 444F deal with those circumstances.
<P>

3   	The factual circumstances of this case are as follows.  The
first defendant, which is in voluntary administration, operated
a colliery
known as the West Bellambi Colliery upon a coal lease held by an associated
company, the second defendant, which is also
in voluntary administration.  The
fourth defendant is the administrator of both those companies.  In that
operation the first defendant
used a Joy continuous coal miner ("the machine").
The machine was charged or mortgaged in favour of the plaintiff under an
Equipment
Finance and Security Agreement dated 15 June 1988 ("the mortgage").
There is no doubt that the first defendant is in default in its
obligations
under the mortgage so as to give the plaintiff a right to repossess the
machine.  The plaintiff has appointed a receiver
of the machine under the
mortgage.  It is also common ground that the plaintiff's actions to enforce its
security and to repossess
the machine commenced before the voluntary
administration so that s 441B applies.  Among the rights which the plaintiff
has under
the mortgage is that the mortgagor will, under cl 8.1(k), do or cause
to be done anything requested by the mortgagee for assisting
in the execution,
or exercise, of any power conferred by the mortgage, such as, for instance, the
powers to repossess and sell.
<P>

4   	The machine is presently some 14 kilometres down the coal
mine, not vertically, of course, but some 14 kilometres of underground
tunnels
must be traversed to bring it to the surface.  It is a large machine.  There
will be difficulties in getting it out.  There
has been a roof fall in a
relevant passage in recent times, although this has been repaired.  There may
be regulations under the
coal mining legislation which must be complied with
for the machine to be removed, although there is controversy as to just what
regulatory regime applies at the moment and what is involved in obtaining any
necessary consents.  It is quite clear that removing
the machine will be a
costly operation, but there is also considerable controversy as to the cost
estimates, which are in evidence.
 They range between about $50,000 and more
than $200,000.  As may be expected, under the mortgage the mortgagee is
entitled to charge
to the mortgagor any costs it incurs in recovering the
machine.
<P>

5   	It is in this context that the plaintiff seeks injunctive
relief from the Court to facilitate its recovery of the machine and
the
administrator seeks from the Court orders under s 441D(2) which would prevent
its recovery during the continuation of the administration.
 It is again common
ground that that duration is short.  A DCA has been propounded by resolution of
a creditors' meeting and under
the provisions of the Law mentioned above the
only open alternatives are that next week the administration will expire when
that
DCA is executed, or will terminate when the DCA is not executed within the
requisite time.
<P>

6   	As appears from the recitation of s 441D above the Court
may make orders under subsection (2) only if satisfied that what the
administrator proposes to do during the administration will adequately protect
the chargee's interests.  Clearly what the administrator
is proposing to do at
the moment is to carry into effect, if he can, the proposed DCA.  That document
is, in general terms, in fairly
standard form for a DCA.  A feature of it is
that it proposes the execution simultaneously with the DCA of a Business Sale
and Purchase
Agreement ("the sale agreement") under which the colliery
operation will be sold to Allied Coal Pty Limited ("the purchaser").  In
other
words, if the sale agreement is not executed the DCA will not be executed.  The
sale agreement contemplates either that the
machine may be purchased along with
the colliery, or may not be purchased along with the colliery; the former
obviously can occur
only if the amount owing to the plaintiff is paid out and
the machine is discharged of the plaintiff's rights.
<P>

7   	There is evidence available that it is the present
intention that the sale agreement and, therefore, the DCA will be entered
into
only if the purchase of the machine is effected and, therefore, the plaintiff
is paid out.  Whilst I have no doubt of the veracity
of the relevant deponent,
intentions can, of course, change in quite short time, particularly in hard
commercial negotiations.  If
the sale takes place including the machine the
plaintiff's problems will be at an end, for it will have been paid out.  If the
sale
does not go ahead, and it is said that the intention is that it should not
without the sale of the machine, the machine will still
be in the depths of the
colliery, but it will still be owned by the first defendant and subject, as
now, to all the plaintiff's rights,
and this will have occurred inside the next
week; on the evidence, there is hardly likely to be any prejudice to the
plaintiff in
so short a time.  The situation which is said to be at present
unlikely, but on the evidence certainly is possible, is that the DCA
and the
sale agreement may be entered into, but on the basis that the machine is not
sold with the other assets of the colliery.
 In that situation, the the
plaintiff says that it could then face an additional difficulty which does not
exist at present. That
is that, whilst its rights as against the first
defendant and over the machine itself would be unaffected, there may be mining
operations
conducted in the colliery by a new owner, which may object to their
being disturbed or disrupted by the removal of the machine blocking
for some
time access to the colliery.
<P>

8   	I should say that there has been some contention in this
matter as to whether or not there is a firm agreement between the
purchaser and
the plaintiff's receiver for the sale of the machine at a price that has been
determined.  It is clear from the evidence
that the two sides to that proposed
agreement have different beliefs as to whether such an agreement exists.  There
were some attempts
to urge me that I ought determine that question in these
proceedings, but they are not a suitable vehicle for the determination of
that
question, nor is it necessary for me to do so, to dispose of the present
application, and I express no view as to that matter.
 The range of
possibilities which exist at the moment I have adumbrated above.
<P>

9   	It seems to me clear that the determination of an
application under s 441D(2) involves two steps.  First, there is a threshold
issue.  The Court must be satisfied of the matter referred to in subsection
(3).  Unless it attains such satisfaction it has no discretion
which it can
exercise.  If it does attain that satisfaction, then it must exercise its
discretion as to whether or not to make an
order under s 441D(2).
<P>

10   	In approaching the exercise of discretion under s 441D(2)
the Court needs to take into account the policy of the Law in relation
to
administration and in relation to the exercise of the rights of creditors of
the company during the administration.  This policy
is illustrated by the
limited approach which the courts have taken to the grant of leave to commence
proceedings under s 440D; <b>Foxcraft v The Ink Group Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2015%20ACSR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 15
ACSR 203</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20ACLC%201063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 ACLC 1063.</a>  That approach was stated as follows by Austin J, of
this Court, in<b> Brian Rochford (admin apptd) Ltd v Textile Clothing &amp;
Footwear Union of NSW</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2030%20ACSR%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 30 ACSR 38</a> at 58:
<P>

"The reported cases show that the courts exercise their discretion to grant
leave under s 440D with caution, having regard to the
structure and underlying
policy of Pt 5.3A.  For example, in<b> Australian Liquor Hospitality and
Miscellaneous Workers' Union v Terranora Lakes Country Club Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201200" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996)
14 ACLC 1200</a> Davies J drew attention to the strict time limits under which an
administration must proceed, the administrator's risk of personal
liability and
the consequent need for the administrator to take steps to reduce sources of
liability during the administration. 
He said that for the Court to grant an
injunction to restrain the administrator from terminating the employment of
employees, as
was sought, would not accord with the pattern laid down by the
Corporations Law, and the injunction might interrupt the proper course
of the
administration and consequently the restoration of the company to
profitability.  Similarly, in<b> Foxcroft v The Ink Group Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%201063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12
ACLC 1063</a> [sic] Young J noted the important difference between a company in
administration and a company in liquidation, namely that a company
in
administration is seeking to continue to trade and to maximize its chance of
remaining in business.  The freeze on proceedings
which is applied by s 440D
should generally be complete, in his Honour's view, since to allow one creditor
to proceed would distract
the administrator and involve legal costs.  Young J
went so far as to say (at 1065) that leave under s 440D will rarely be
granted.
<P>

In the present case I must have regard to the policy of Pt 5.3A and in
particular, the need to give the administrator a chance to
develop proposals
which would preserve the value of the company as a going concern, given the
large discrepancy between that value
and the company's value in a liquidation
sale."
<P>

The regime as to secured creditors has obvious differences from that in
relation to unsecured creditors, but is not without similarity.
 Their rights
to enforce are frozen during the administration unless enforcement action
commenced before the administration, and,
even if it had, if curial enforcement
is to be commenced or continued, secured creditors, too, must seek leave to
proceed:  <b>J &amp; B Records Ltd v Brashs Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 172.</a>
<P>

11   	There is no or little authority on the exercise of the
Court's discretion under s 441D(2).  Some guidance may be taken from
the
explanatory memorandum to the Corporations Law Reform Bill 1992 of which pars
541 - 543 are in the following terms:
<P>

"Proposed section 441D - Court may limit powers of chargee, etc, in relation to
charged property
<P>

541	The earlier sections in this proposed Division will create significant
exceptions to the moratorium which will otherwise apply
once an administrator
is appointed.  The danger with these exceptions will be that a single creditor
may be in a position to frustrate
the objectives of the administration, even
though that creditor's interests may not be large compared to the interests of
others
involved in the administration, or may be capable of being adequately
protected through alternative means which would allow the administration
to
proceed effectively.
<P>

542	Proposed section 441D accordingly will allow the Court to order a chargee,
receiver or other person who is exercising powers
under proposed subsection
441B(1) to refrain from performing specified functions or exercising specified
powers, provided the administrator
is able to put before the Court a plan of
action which the Court is satisfied will adequately protect the chargee's
interests.
<P>

543	An example of a situation where this provision might be useful would arise
where a chargee, just prior to the appointment of
an administrator, has
appointed a receiver in respect of a machine, which is essential to the
operation of the factory owned by the
company.  The administrator may be able
to protect the interests of the creditor in a number of different ways which
would avoid
the frustration of the objectives of the administration which could
follow from the company not being able to use that machine. 
For example, the
administrator may propose that that creditor be paid out over a certain period
of time.  Alternatively, the administrator
may be able to offer the creditor
security over some other asset, such as a piece of real estate owned by the
company which is not
essential to the company's core operation.  Provided the
administrator is able to convince the Court that whatever plan the
administrator
proposes will adequately protect the creditor's interests, the
Court will be able to make an order that allows the administration
to proceed
effectively."
<P>

12   	There are similar regimes provided for in the US and the
UK, in the former case in Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code 1978
and in the
latter in the Insolvency Act 1986:  see generally P Crutchfield,<i> Corporate
Voluntary Administration Law </i>(2nd ed, 1997) 41-56.  The US Code is more
similar in the regard at present under consideration than the UK Act, but
authority under
both statutes has been cited in the Federal Court by Lehane J
in<b> Hamilton v National Australia Bank Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2066%20FCR%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 66 FCR 12</a> in connexion
with the construction of s 444F (see below).
<P>

13   	Some assistance may be derived from decisions relating to
s 444F, which is the corresponding provision of the regime which
prevails
during the subsistence of the DCA.  As to that section, in <b>Hamilton</b>
supra Lehane J said at 31 - 32:
<P>

"The matters which the Court should have in mind when deciding whether a
secured creditor's interests will be adequately protected
if an order under s
444F(2) is made have not been the subject of consideration in any case which
counsel or I have been able to discover.
 I was referred to two authorities in
other jurisdictions, one the decision of the US Supreme Court in<b> United
Savings Association of Texas v Timbers of Inward Forest Associates Ltd</b>
(1988) 98 L ed 2d 740, particularly at 746, the other the decision of the
English Court of Appeal in<b> Re Atlantic Computer Systems plc </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20Ch%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] Ch
505.</a>  Because of the very considerable differences between the provisions of
the Corporations Law and the legislation of other jurisdictions,
it is
necessary to treat authorities from other jurisdictions with some care.
Nevertheless, in so far as the authorities indicate
a reluctance to deprive a
secured creditor of its proprietary rights or to sanction an arrangement which
will cause those rights
to depreciate substantially in value, that approach is,
no doubt, equally applicable under the Corporations Law:  it is unlikely
to be
the case that a secured creditor who, in a significant way, is deprived of its
interest, or the value of its interest, without
substantially equivalent
compensation, is adequately protected. <b> </b>However, that does little more
than emphasise that the Court does not have jurisdiction under a provision such
as that under consideration
unless it attains satisfaction of the adequacy of
protection of the chargee."
<P>

14   	Turning now to the question of the process whereby the
Court attains or does not attain satisfaction under s 441D(3), it seems
to me
that there are two pertinent things to be noted.  The first is that what is to
be focused on as providing the satisfaction
is what the administrator proposes
to do during the administration.  The second is that the protection of which
the Court must be
satisfied is "adequate" protection.  "Adequate" is a word
which imports notions of relativity.  It is relevantly defined in the Macquarie
Dictionary as:
<P>

"Equal to the requirement or occasion; fully sufficient, suitable, or fit (oft.
fol. by<b> </b><i>to </i>or<b> </b><i>for</i>)."
<P>

In other words, the protection as to which the Court is required to be
satisfied is not protection which is absolute or perfect
in all circumstances,
but protection which is adequate or suitable considering the circumstances
which actually prevail.
<P>

15   	With those things in mind, I turn to consider the
sufficiency of what the administrator proposes to do in this case.  He proposes
to proceed to enter, if he can, into the DCA and the sale agreement.  As I have
already noted, Mr Coles, of Queen's Counsel for the
plaintiff, did, during the
course of the hearing, press on me that it was vital for his client to get the
machine out of the colliery
during the administration since, at its end, the
colliery might pass into other hands, being the hands of a purchaser with which
the plaintiff did not have privity of contract and that that purchaser might be
unwilling to cooperate with the plaintiff in the
removal of the machine,
particularly since this had a potential to disrupt production in the mine, and
that, equally, because of
the lack of privity of contract, the plaintiff may
not be able to compel the purchaser's cooperation.
<P>

16   	It should be pointed out that the difference between that
situation and the present situation may not be as great as appears
at first
sight, because, although the first defendant is the mortgagor of the machine
and has been the operator of the colliery,
it is not, as already stated, the
holder of the coal lease under which the colliery is conducted; that is the
second defendant, with
which the plaintiff does not now have privity of
contract so far as this mortgage is concerned.  However, bearing in mind the
possibility
of the disruption of production, it does seem to me that upon a
sale the plaintiff's position, so far as recovering the machine is
concerned,
may be weaker vis-a-vis a purchaser than it at present is vis-a-vis the first
defendant.
<P>

17   	During the course of the hearing I raised with Mr Angyal,
of  counsel for the administrator, the fact that I saw this as perhaps
being an
inadequacy of the regime at that time proposed, from the point of view of the
protection of the plaintiff's interests. 
The administrator's response was to
offer an undertaking in the following terms:
<P>

"The administrator of the First Defendant undertakes not to sign any Sale of
Business Agreement unless it includes a clause substantially
in the form of the
following:
<P>

6.3	If any assets used by the Vendor in the Business and situate as at the
Transfer Date upon the Premises are subject to a charge
the Purchaser assents
to the Vendor or the chargee of such asset removing such asset from the
Premises upon giving reasonable prior
notice to the Purchaser and at such time
that causes as little disruption as reasonably possible to the operation of the
Business
by the Purchaser and subject to any applicable statutory requirements,
provided that the chargee:
<P>

(a)	pays all costs directly related to the removal (which for the avoidance of
doubt specifically excludes any loss of production
costs); and
<P>

(b)	pays to the Purchaser any costs reasonably incurred by  the Purchaser in
complying with any statutory requirements relating
to the removal."
<P>

Mr Coles protested that this undertaking did not absolutely give to the
plaintiff all the rights and protection that it had under
the mortgage.  In
particular, he protested that it was deficient because of the potential
requirement in (b) to pay the purchaser's
costs incurred by the purchaser in
complying with statutory requirements relating to the removal.
<P>

18   	However, as I have already said, the terms of s 441D(3)
are not absolute.  The real situation at the moment is that as the
first
defendant is insolvent.  Even though it is its primary liability to pay the
costs of removal, that is not likely to be honoured
in the first instance by
the company or by its administrator with his duties to the general body of
creditors.  As a matter of reality,
if the plaintiff wishes to recover the
machine, all it can do is to incur itself the costs of removal and debit them
to the account
of the first defendant, that debit becoming one of the unsecured
debts of the first defendant.  It should also be noted specifically
that the
undertaking offered provides for the payment of the bulk of the costs; in the
circumstances, the bulk of the costs involved
are those covered in (a).  It
would seem that, on the evidence, I could not come to the conclusion that there
would be any large
amount payable to the purchaser under (b) and it does not
seem to me to be unreasonable that the plaintiff should be required to
pay that
payment if the purchaser has to pay to comply with statutory requirements in
relation to the removal.  This additional undertaking
being proffered, it seems
to me, in any event, in the light of the circumstances which I have outlined,
that it is a fairly remote
possibility that the plaintiff will face any
additional difficulty or significantly greater cost in recovering the machine
next week
after the administration ends, as compared with the situation this
week, if in fact the administration ends in circumstances necessitating
further
action on the plaintiff's part.  Even in that event, the possibility of
disadvantage is largely removed by the new clause
6.3, which will bind the
purchaser, through the mechanism provided by the undertaking, to permit the
removal of the machine even
if that causes some disruption to the operation of
the colliery and without compensation for the disruption.  In those
circumstances
I have formed the view that what is proposed by the administrator
for him to do during the administration will adequately protect
the chargee's
interests within the meaning of s 441D(3) in the circumstances which
prevail.
<P>

19   	I come then to the exercise of my discretion under s
441D(2).  In exercising that discretion I bear in mind the shortness
of the
remaining duration of the administration and the protection afforded to the
plaintiff, whether the DCA comes into effect or
not and whether the sale
agreement comes into effect or not, as discussed above.  I also bear in mind
that the general policy of
the Law is to permit companies to be returned to
viability or, as in this instance, to arrange for enterprises which companies
have
conducted to be disposed of as going concerns so as to effect the greatest
return to the creditors and contributories, particularly
as compared with the
result of a fire sale.  In this regard, there is evidence as to the value of
the machine which  it has not been
necessary for me to advert to previously.
Such machines are apparently in demand and this one will not be reduced to
scrap value
by being taken out of its present use in this colliery.  However,
it is common ground that the value of the machine on the open market
outside
the colliery is considerably less than it is in situ in this colliery on a
going concern basis.  In addition, there are the
costs of its removal from the
colliery, the estimates of which vary from some tens of thousands of dollars
well into six figures.
 It is true that special provision is made by the Law
for the position of secured creditors who have commenced enforcement action
before the administration.  One of the special things they are given is the
requirement of protection in s 441D(3).  But once that
is satisfied, it seems
to me that the general policy of this Part of the Law, although it does not
entirely govern the situation,
is a factor to be taken into account in
exercising the discretion under s 441D(2) when it arises.  Taking all the above
factors into
account, I have decided, in this case, to exercise the discretion
by making an appropriate order under s 441D(2) upon the giving
of an
undertaking to the Court by the administrator in the form set out above.
<P>

20   	Short minutes to effect this decision should be brought
in.
