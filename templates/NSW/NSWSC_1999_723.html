<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>In May 1996 the plaintiffs obtained the
services of a Ms Ruth Exmann as a babysitter for their two young children, who
were then about
six months and two and a half years old.  In January 1997,
whilst at the plaintiff's home, Ms Exmann slipped over and injured herself.
 At
this time the plaintiffs were insured with the defendant under a home and
personal insurance policy which indemnified them against
their legal liability
to pay compensation for personal injury, except to any employee.  The
plaintiffs seek a declaration, in effect,
that they are indemnified by the
policy in respect of the liability arising from Ms Exmann's injury at their
home.  If Ms Exmann
was, in all the circumstances, employed by the plaintiffs,
they are not indemnified whilst if, on the other hand, Ms Exmann was not
an
employee (or, as the conventional language has it, was an independent
contractor) then they are indemnified.
<P>

2   	The plaintiffs were employed at the University of New
England in Armidale where they lived at the relevant time.  They advertised
for
the services of a babysitter for their two children.  At the interview, Ms
Exmann was informed that the plaintiffs could afford
to pay about $180 to $200
a week but could pay a little more if she was registered with Medicare as they
then would be entitled to
a child care rebate.  Ms Exmann replied by saying
that she wanted everything to be "above board".  She said that she would
register
with Medicare and made it clear that she would declare to the income
tax authorities any money which she was paid.  She said that
she had a problem
with the taxation office on her last job and asked the plaintiffs to take the
tax out of her payments to make it
easier for her.  Ms Exmann wanted regular
hours and would not work for less than $50 a day or $250 a week.  The
plaintiffs told Ms
Exmann that they intended to go away at Christmas with the
children and that this would enable Ms Exmann to "take a break" and they
said
that they would pay her whilst they were away.  Shortly after this interview Ms
Exmann commenced babysitting.  Mr Harrop became
registered as a group employer
so that Ms Exmann's income tax could be paid as she had stipulated.  It appears
that the plaintiffs
had agreed also to pay Ms Exmann superannuation although
this never eventuated.  
<P>

3   	As the plaintiffs were absent at work during the day, it is
obvious that they needed to leave their children under the care
and control of
a responsible person able to look after them without any supervision.  Amongst
the communications between the plaintiffs
(mostly Ms Graham) and Ms Exmann,
were messages between them written in a notebook kept for that purpose and
which was used because
it was sometimes difficult, having regard to the busy
work schedules of the plaintiffs, to maintain regular and sufficient contact.
It is clear from the evidence of Ms Graham and the messages in the notebook,
part of which was tendered, that the plaintiffs did
not, in fact, seek to
exercise any supervisory functions over the performance by Ms Exmann of her
duties.  This was at all events
unnecessary, since it is evident that Ms Exmann
was exemplary in her care of the children.  Ms Graham said, and I accept, she
relied
upon Ms Exmann to use her skill, knowledge and experience as a
babysitter to exercise her discretion, without reference to her or
her husband,
as to what she should do to entertain the children, when and how they should be
fed and, if necessary, to exercise appropriate
discipline.  It also appears
that Ms Exmann was given a wide discretion as to when and where she took the
children whilst they were
under her control.  They might stay at home or she
could look after them in her home or her mother's home and, indeed, looked
after
them at the home of a friend on occasions.  Ms Graham had never met
either Ms Exmann's mother or the other friend but clearly trusted
Ms Exmann in
this regard.  Sometimes, Ms Exmann's children or her mother looked after the
plaintiffs' children.  She took them to
outside activities on her own
initiative.  On occasions, Ms Exmann was unable to look after the children and
the plaintiffs had to
make alternative arrangements.  The evidence does not say
so, but it seems that Ms Exmann was not paid on these occasions.  In addition
to taking care of the children, Ms Exmann quite voluntarily undertook household
tasks, such as cleaning and ironing, work which the
plaintiffs did not expect
her to undertake and for which, as the communications book makes clear, they
were both surprised and grateful.
<P>

4   	Of course, in the circumstances, it is obvious that the
plaintiffs could not actually supervise Ms Exmann's work.  Such matters
as the
right of the plaintiffs to give directions as to how Ms Exmann was to look
after the children was, perhaps not surprisingly,
not the subject of specific
agreement.  Certainly, the plaintiffs were generally aware of the activities
that she undertook.  Ms
Graham thought that although Ms Exmann looked after the
children most of the time at their house, as I have mentioned, she would
often
go to her own home and sometimes to her mother's.  Although in
cross-examination Ms Graham said that she would have felt able
to direct Ms
Exmann not to carry out a form of discipline or to instruct her that she did
not wish the children to undertake any
particular activity, I do not think that
she was describing the nature of the relationship with Ms Exmann.  When Mr
Harrop was asked
whether he would expect Ms Exmann to do what she asked of her,
he answered, "There were a couple of things coming up like that and
we did try
to, yes, and she just, would just do it her way . . .she did things her own way
and in the way she felt like doing them
and we didn't have very much to do with
it, there were no occasions we had to worry about it".  When he was asked
whether the nature
of the relationship was such that they had the power to
order Ms Exmann to do this or that, Mr Harrop answered, and I have no doubt
that this was truthful, "I have never thought about it before", although he
said that he assumed that, "like any other babysitter,
she would do what I
requested".  Ms Graham's evidence was to the same effect.  When it was
suggested to her that she felt herself
able to tell Ms Exmann what matters she
was happy with and what matters she was not happy with she answered, "I feel we
would discuss
it rather than tell her . . .[and] I think we would have a
discussion until we did agree".  On the evidence as a whole, it is clear
that
the plaintiffs had not abdicated their ultimate control over their children
and, if they became concerned about any matter affecting
their welfare, would
have exercised their authority as parents but this does not mean that they had
or understood they had authority
over Ms Exmann.  Ms Exmann had a very
considerable degree of discretion and responsibility, determined by her own
judgment and good
sense.  The nature of the plaintiffs' relationship with Ms
Exmann more closely fits the description of delegate than of agent.  
<P>

5   	In considering the appropriate characterisation of the
relationship between the plaintiffs and Ms Exmann, the observations
in
<i>Connelly v Wells</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2055%20IR%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 55 IR 73</a> of Gleeson CJ at are apt -
<P>

"Where the relationship between two persons is founded in contract, the
character of the relationship depends upon the meaning and
effect of the
contract.  In the absence of a suggestion that a contract was varied after it
was originally made, its meaning and
effect must be determined as at the time
it was entered into.  If the contract is in writing, then the court which is
considering
the nature of the relationship between the parties is directed to
an examination of the terms of the written agreement in the light
of the
circumstances surrounding its making.  (<i>Narich Pty Limited v Commissioner of
Payroll Tax</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20NSWLR%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 NSWLR 597</a> at 601.)
<P>

"In some cases, of which the present is an example, the contract may have been
entered into without writing, and in circumstances
of considerable informality.
This may mean that it is more difficult to reach a conclusion as to when a
contract was entered into,
and as to the terms of the agreement which the
parties made.  The conduct of the parties may need to be examined for the
purpose
of reaching a conclusion as to their common intention as to the terms
and conditions on which they were contracting with one another.
 However, the
basic principles remain the same."
<P>

6   	In the same case, Kirby P analysed the creation, evolution
and qualification of a number of supposed litmus tests for resolving
disputed
cases of employment.  In particular, his Honour pointed out that the
traditional test relying on the distinction between
the authority of the
putative employer to direct the putative employee not only as to what he or she
did but also as to how he or
she did it, evolved into a search "not for
<i>actual </i>but for the ultimate <i>authority </i>to control the work
involved, employment lying in the latter" (ibid at 81).  However, as his Honour
pointed out, this test did not
provide sound guidance in all cases since the
employment relationship was accepted as established even where the asserted
employee
was not and could not be subject to effective control, for example,
where he or she worked in isolated places or was involved in
highly specialised
or technical activities.  
<P>

7   	The present law requires a consideration of the whole of
the nature of the relationship between the protagonists and the weighing
of a
number of indicia of which none may be determinative:  <i>Stevens v Brodribb
Sawmilling Company Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 16.</a>  In that case Mason J
said (at 24) -
<P>

" . . . the existence of control, whilst significant, is not the sole criterion
by which to gauge whether a relationship is one
of employment.  The approach of
this Court has been to regard it as merely one of a number of indicia which
must be considered in
the determination of that question . . .Other relevant
matters include, but are not limited to, the mode of remuneration, the
provision
and maintenance of equipment, the obligation to work, the hours of
work and the provision for holidays, the deduction of income tax
and the
delegation of work by the putative employee."  
<P>

His Honour pointed out that the common law had shifted the emphasis in the
control test from the actual exercise of control to the
right to exercise it,
"so far as there is scope for it" even if it be "only in incidental or
collateral matters" (ibid 28-29), citing
<i>Zuijs v Wirth Bros Pty Limited</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1955/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%2093%20CLR%20561" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 93 CLR 561</a>, which concerned employment of a trapeze artist in a circus,
where the necessity for entirely independent action was obvious in the
performance of the act but where this occurred in a general setting of control
over his participation in the circus undertaking.

<P>

8   	Whilst making the same point, Wilson and Dawson JJ said (at
36) -
<P>

"But in some circumstances it may even be a mistake to treat as decisive a
reservation of control over the manner in which the work
is performed for
another.  That was made clear in <i>Queensland Stations Pty Limited v Federal
Commissioner of Taxation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2070%20CLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 70 CLR 539</a> at 552, a case involving a
droving contract, in which Dixon J observed that the reservation of a right to
direct or superintend the
performance of the task cannot transform into a
contract of service what in essence is an independent contract.  
<P>

"The other indicia of the nature of the relationship have been variously stated
and have been added to from time to time.  Those
suggesting a contract of
service rather than a contract for services include the right to have a
particular person do the work, the
right to suspend or dismiss the person
engaged, the right to the exclusive services of the person engaged and the
right to dictate
the place of work, hours of work and the like.  Those which
indicate a contract for services, include work involving a profession,
trade or
distinct calling on the part of the person engaged, the provision by him of his
own place or work or his own equipment,
the creation by him of goodwill or
saleable assets in the course of his work, the payment by him from his
remuneration of business
expenses of any significant proportion and the payment
to him of remuneration without deduction for income tax.  None of these leads
to any necessary inference, however, and the actual terms and terminology of
the contract will always be of considerable importance.
 
<P>

"Having said that, we should point out that any attempt to list the relevant
matters, however incompletely, may mislead because
they can be no more than a
guide to the existence of the relationship of master and servant.  The ultimate
question will always be
whether a person is acting as the servant of another or
on his own behalf and the answer to that question may be indicated in ways
which are not always the same and do not always have the same significance."

<P>

Although there was an arrangement that Ms Exmann would continue to receive
payment whilst not working because the plaintiffs were
away on holidays with
their children, it was clearly not a term of the agreement that she was
entitled to any particular period of
annual leave or indeed, any leave at all,
and this was made clear by the holiday arrangements that actually occurred in
late 1996
- early 1997.  Ms Graham came back from holidays early because she
did not wish to pay Ms Exmann for five weeks for no service, which
would have
been the result of her remaining with the children on the north coast rather
than returning to Armidale.  There was no
agreement for sick leave.  The
deduction of income tax was, as I have mentioned, requested by Ms Exmann as a
convenience to herself
and was agreed to on that basis, which indicates that
the parties assumed that Ms Exmann would be otherwise responsible for her own
income tax payments.  Taking these matters together, they signify a mutual
intention that Ms Exmann should not be regarded as an
employee:  <i>Australian
Mutual Provident Society v Chaplin</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1978/1978_7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] UKPC 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2018%20ALR%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 18 ALR 385</a>, applied in <i>BWIU
&amp; ors v Odco Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/87.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 87</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=99%20ALR%20735" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">99 ALR 735</a> at 736.  Whilst Ms Exmann was
directed as to the time for commencement and conclusion of her duties, this was
in reality merely a
reflection of the plaintiffs' work hours;  she was not
directed as to the place of work:  cf <i>Mulhall v Roberts </i>(unreported
NSWCA, 19 July 1995).  The weekly payments were calculated at a daily rate
which did not assume any particular number
of hours and paid by bank transfer
at the request of Ms Exmann.
<P>

9   	Taking all these considerations into account, even though
the plaintiffs retained their ultimate responsibility for the proper
care of
their children, and this was an essential element of their relationship with Ms
Exmann, I conclude that she was not their
employee within the meaning of the
contract of insurance.
<P>

10   	For obvious reasons, the declarations sought are
inappropriate having regard to the way in which this matter was litigated
before me.  However, the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that clause
3.10.3 of the policy of insurance between them and
the defendant does not
operate to exclude the latter's obligation to indemnify the plaintiffs in
respect of bodily injury to Ms Ruth
Exmann which may have occurred on or about
30 January 1997.  The defendant must pay the plaintiffs' costs.
