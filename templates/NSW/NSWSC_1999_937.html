<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT Re re-opening of plaintiff's case.  (See page 1 of transcript of 10
September 1999)
<P>

 
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:   The evidence in this matter concluded on Wednesday
afternoon, as did the submissions.  Judgment was then reserved.
 The plaintiff
has now filed a  Notice of Motion seeking leave to re-open the proceedings to
adduce further evidence.  That evidence
is contained in an affidavit sworn by
the plaintiff on 9 September and it relates to conversations which he said that
he had that
day.
<P>

2  	In substance, he says that he was advised by his solicitor, and I
understand also by his counsel, to return to the colliery
to make appropriate
arrangements for his return to work.  He is, at this stage, subject to a
certificate which runs out at the end
of the month.
<P>

3  	He said that on speaking to the Human Resources Manager, Mr
Lever, an inquiry was made as to whether his claim had been finalised
on the
basis that he would be "finished up" or would be keeping his job.  He was
informed that he was needed in the washery.  He
said that he would like to go
back to work, but it would be on permanent restricted duties.  Those duties he
described in the following
terms: "Restrictions on lifting, using heavy
equipment, staying away from vibrating equipment, large magnets, high voltage
areas,
etc, not working underground."
<P>

4  	Mr Lever said that he would speak to Mr Salisbury, the safety
manager; and to Mr Strauss, the Coal Washery Manager, to see what
could be
worked out.  The plaintiff added that the restrictions, would be there for
life, and that he needed some assurance that
he would be kept in the job with
these restrictions, until he was 60.  Mr Lever repeated that they would have to
talk to Mr Salisbury,
to Mr Strauss and also to Mr Butcher, the mine manager.

<P>

5  	There was then a conversation with the safety manager, in the
course of which, the plaintiff said, Mr Salisbury informed him
that the mine
did not allow anyone to stay on in their job under permanent restricted duties.
The case of a federation miner, John
Raines, was cited.  The plaintiff said
that he observed, "John (Mr  Raines) was retrenched under medical reasons, is
that what will
happen to me?"  Mr Lever said, "Yes, go and see Wayne McAndrew.
Talk to him and Barry Cosier and we'll go from there."  I observe
that Mr
McAndrew was the district union representative, and Mr Cosier was the
plaintiff's solicitor.
<P>

6  	Mr Lever then enquired whether the plaintiff had been in touch
with the Joint Coal Board about retraining to which he replied
in the negative.
Mr Salisbury said that he would telephone them and advise that the plaintiff
would be in contact.  He was informed,
"They will ask about interests, hobbies,
give an IQ test and give you an idea about what you could do."  
<P>

7  	It is on the basis of that evidence that the application is
brought.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff has been cross-examined to the effect that the
conversation was contrived and designed to improve his claim for
damages.  He
was asked in particular, whether he had been given a list of the questions
designed to extract admissions from the defendant
which might assist his claim
for damages.  The plaintiff denied that that was the case.  He said that the
sole advice given to him
was that he should go back to the mine to make
arrangements for his return to work.
<P>

9  	The defendant has not called any evidence on the application, but
opposes it upon the basis that this evidence could have been
called in the
trial, and that the plaintiff should have anticipated his possible retrenchment
by calling evidence as to mine policy,
or otherwise, if this was to be an issue
in the proceedings.
<P>

10  	It may be observed that the particular conversations, in respect
of which evidence is sought to be called in the trial, did
occur after the
proceedings were completed but before judgment was delivered.  In that sense
the evidence was not available to the
plaintiff before the hearing concluded.
Whether similar answers would have been received, had there been a conversation
along those
lines before commencement of the hearing, is by no means clear.
<P>

11  	The assessment of damages for impairment of future earning
capacity is the most difficult issue in this case since it depends
upon a
number of uncertainties, relating to the plaintiff's medical condition, and
also to the continuation of employment of a worker
with restrictions.  It is
clear, from the evidence which was led in the trial, that the plaintiff does
have some restrictions which
prevent him from undertaking heavy lifting and
using heavy equipment and which also require him to stay away from vibrating
equipment
and work underground.  Additionally, there is some evidence to the
effect that because of the epidural stimulator, and the presence
of a pacemaker
in his body, he may face difficulty if working in close proximity to electrical
fields.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff may have been in a position to have called some
further general evidence on this topic, relating for example,
to mine policy,
or the experience of other comparable workers with permanent restrictions.  As
I have observed, however, the precise
evidence concerning the attitude of mine
management to himself, would not have been available before 9 September.
<P>

13  	Having regard to the fact that this evidence does throw light
upon what is a critical issue in the trial, and also having regard
to the once
and for all assessment rule, I propose, in the exercise of my discretion, to
allow the plaintiff to reopen to call the
evidence.  I am not persuaded that
the defendant would suffer any prejudice in that regard.  I am satisfied,
conversely, that the
plaintiff could suffer a significant injustice if the
application was refused.  In order to allow the defendant a proper opportunity
to call evidence in reply, I propose to stand over the further hearing of the
proceedings, and to defer giving judgment until that
opportunity is either
taken up, or I am informed that the defendant will allow the matter to be
determined upon the evidence now
available.
<P>

14  	It is accepted, as I understand it, that the evidence called
this morning, including the affidavit, can be treated as evidence
in the trial.
However, I add that since the defendant has had limited opportunity to consider
that affidavit, I will allow it an
opportunity to further cross-examine the
plaintiff at the resumed hearing  should it so desire.
<P>

15  	I reserve the question of costs.  In that regard, it seems to
me, that unless good reason to the contrary is shown, it would
be reasonable to
expect the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the application, and of
any additional costs occasioned by
it.  That I regard to be a reasonable price
for the discretionary exercise of the power which is sought to be invoked.
However, I
will defer further consideration of that matter until the plaintiff
has had an opportunity to be heard in relation to it.
<P>
