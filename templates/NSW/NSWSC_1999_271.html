<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES </b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY, 1 APRIL 1999</b>
<P>

<b>12212/98   -   ALBERT ANDREW PHILPOTT v </b>
<P>

<b>GREGORY RONALD STEPHEN KETTLEY &amp;	ANOR </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Stated case)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER</b>  On 9 October, 1996 J A Huber LCM delivered a judgment on a
civil claim brought by Gregory Ronald Stephen Kettley and Jacqueline
Veronice
Kettley (the plaintiffs/respondents) against Albert Andrew Philpott (the
defendant/appellant).  The plaintiff claimed that
the defendant, a building
consultant was professionally negligent when he carried out a pre-purchase
building inspection. 
<P>

2	The learned Magistrate found in favour of the plaintiffs and ordered that the
defendant pay to the plaintiff $12,000.00 plus interest
and costs.  These
proceedings were commenced by summons filed 11 September, 1998.  The appellant
seeks to disturb the decision reached
by the learned Magistrate.
<P>

3	At the outset, it may be helpful to make some brief comment concerning the
remedy pursued by the appellant.  The authorities make
it clear that the remedy
of stated case provides a limited avenue of appeal.  The court has jurisdiction
to determine only questions
of law and only such questions of law as are
submitted to it (<b><u>Allen v Kerr &amp; Anor</u></b> (1995) Aust Tort Reports
81-354 and <b><u>The Australian Gas Light Company v The Valuer-General</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1940/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] NSWStRp 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2040%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20126" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126).</a>  The matter of what is a question of law (as opposed
to a question of fact) was considered, inter alia, in <b><u>Allen</u></b> and
<b><u>Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 139</a> at
155-156.  The facts stated are to be taken as the ultimate facts for whatever
purpose the case is stated (<b><u>Press v Mathers</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1927/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1927] VicLawRp 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281927%29%20VLR%20326" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1927) VLR 326</a> at p
330).  The onus lies on the appellant to demonstrate that there has been an
error of law.
<P>

4	According to s 106(1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> 1902, this court shall hear
and determine the questions of law arising on a stated case and shall either
reverse, affirm, or amend
the determination in respect of which the case was
stated;  remit the matter to the Justice of Justices with the opinion of the
court;
 or make such other order in relation to the matter as seems fit.
<P>

5	The appellant submitted that the learned Magistrate gave inadequate reasons
and the decision was erroneous in law.  He has identified
three areas where
inadequate reasons were given.  The absence of proper reasons does constitute
an error of law.
<P>

6	On the issue of the adequacy of reasons, the appellant referred to two
authorities <b><u>Apps &amp; Anor v Pilet</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 350</a> and
<b><u>Mifsud v Campbell</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20NSWLR%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) NSWLR 725.</a>  The earlier authority
referred to reasons for decision in relation to interlocutory practice matters
and was not directly on point.
 However both cases referred to above cited
<b><u>Soulemezi v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247.</a>
<P>

<b><u>What are adequate reasons</u>?</b>
<P>

7	If a judge indicates even in brief terms, his or her processes of reasoning
to a conclusion on disputed facts, this court may
not interfere.  But where he
or she does not do so, or where the inferences from his or her given reasons
establish or suggest a
misapprehension of the law, the court may intervene for
then an error of law is shown - see Kirby P in <b><u>Soulemezis</u></b> at p
249, <b><u>Azzopardi</u></b> and Hope JA in <b><u>Mahoney v Industrial
Registrar of New South Wales</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%208%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 8 NSWLR 1.</a>  Reasons need not be
elaborate.  Reasons need to be given only so far as is necessary to indicate to
the parties why the decision
was made and to allow them such rights as may be
available to them.  
<P>

8	In relation to evaluating the evidence of witnesses Mahoney JA in
<b><u>Soulemezis</u></b> stated:
<P>

	<b>"The weight which a judge will give to the evidence of a witness will often
be not capable of rationalisation beyond the statement:
having heard him, I am
not satisfied that I should accept what he says. The weight which a judge gives
to a particular fact may be
affected by, as it has frequently been put, his
experience and, in particular, his experience of the significance of that fact
in
the order of things. It was this to which reference was made in Morgan v
Babcock and Wilcox Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1929/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2043%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 43 CLR 163</a> at 173 and Martin v Osborne <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55
CLR 367</a> at 375, in referring to "general human experience" and the like. In
explaining the weight which he has given to a fact in a particular
decision of
fact, the judge is not, I think, required to detail why he sees, for example,
the significance of a CAT scan, as being
greater than, for example, the opinion
of a particular treating doctor. His reasons, in the particular case, may
partake as much
of intuition based on experience as on formal and deductive
reasoning.</b>
<P>

9	In a recent High Court decision, <b><u>State Rail Authority of New South
Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Limited</u></b> (in Liq)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJ 306</a>
the court discussed the history and principles governing appellate review of
questions of fact (see Kirby J at pp 322-327).  It must
be remembered that when
a trial judge resolves the evidence between witnesses the subtle influences of
demeanour on his or her determination
cannot be overlooked.  This court does
not have the advantage which the learned Magistrate enjoyed in seeing and
hearing.
<P>

10	The agreed facts contained in the stated case were that the
defendant/appellant was a licensed builder and building consultant
retained for
a fee by the plaintiffs/respondents to carry out a pre-purchase building
inspection of a property known as 10 Glenbawn
Place Leumeah (the property) and
that as a consequence of Mr Stevenson's inspection he prepared a report dated
15 February 1991.
 It is agreed the plaintiffs/respondents subsequently
purchased the subject property on 22 February 1991 for the sum of $120,000
and
later sold the subject property on 6 July 1994 for the sum of $92,000.  It was
agreed that the value of the subject property
if it was unaffected by
efflorescence and fretting brickwork would have been $104,000.  
<P>

11	The stated case referred to three issues and I have reproduced them together
with the corresponding grounds of determination.
 The first issue that was
determined by the learned Magistrate was, what was the state of brick and
mortar decay which exhibited
itself at 10 Glenbawn Place Leumeah on or about 15
February 1991?  The learned Magistrate found that:
<P>

(1)	Mr Kettley noticed that the bricks to the house were darker below the damp
course than those above it and there were one or
two white coloured bricks on
most sides of the house.
<P>

(2)	Mr Kettley in the course of leading antenna wires to various rooms found
the ground under the house was dry and he later dusted
the dirt off his
clothes.
<P>

(3)	Mrs Kettley gave similar evidence to that of her husband about the
brickwork.
<P>

(4)	The report of Mr Stevenson makes no mention of the bricks below the damp
course being darker than those above it nor is there
any mention of white on
any bricks nor is there any mention of the condition of the external wall
except referring to the same as
"feature brickwork".  However Mr Stevenson
noticed some discolouration to a couple of bricks in the external brickwork,
near the
manhole entrance.  He could not remember whether there was any
"whiteness" and he did not notice any bricks displaying signs of
efflorescence.
<P>

12	The Magistrate accepted the evidence of Mr and Mrs Kettley as to the state
of the brickwork in February 1991.  
<P>

13	The defendant/appellant submitted that the Magistrate erred in law as she
failed to give sufficient reasons to, firstly, support
her finding that Mrs
Kettley gave similar evidence to that of her husband about the brickwork;
secondly, by preferring the respondents'/plaintiffs'
expert evidence over that
of the appellant/defendant and failing to give reasons for such preference;
thirdly, by failing to take
account of the evidence of Linzy James Osmond in
relation to the state of the brickwork at the subject property on or about 15
February
1991 and fourthly by failing to make any finding about the evidence of
Linzy James Osmond.
<P>

14	The Magistrate in her judgment commenced her judgment by dividing the
evidence into two categories the first being visual/factual
and the second
being that of expert opinion.  In relation to the visual/factual issue she said
at para 5 of her judgment:
<P>

	<b>"Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant called eminently qualified experts,
Mr Muldovan and Mr Grainger, who not surprisingly gave completely
different
opinions as to what would have been visible in 1991.  I do not intend to go
into any detail as to the different methods
used or which method the Court
prefers.  When faced with differing expert opinions when there is evidence from
"eye witnesses" it
is quite proper for the Court to accept the evidence of
those who were present at the time.  I accept the evidence of Mr and Mrs
Kettley as to the state of the brickwork in February 1991."</b>
<P>

15	Mr and Mrs Kettley, Mr Stevenson and Mr Osmond gave evidence and were cross
examined.  Mr Osmond was the vendor who sold the
property to the plaintiffs.
Mr Stevenson was employed by the defendant to carry out the physical inspection
of this property and
write the pre-purchase report.  While the learned
Magistrate did not specifically refer to the evidence of Mr Stevenson and Mr
Osmond
she stated that she preferred the evidence of Mr and Mrs Kettley.  I
infer from that that she took into account the evidence of Mr
Stevenson and Mr
Osmond because if she did not she would have no reason to say she preferred the
evidence of Mr and Mrs Kettley.
 The learned Magistrate stated that Mr and Mrs
Kettley gave similar evidence about the brickwork.  Mr Kettley noticed that
there
were bricks in the house which were darker below the damp course than
those above it and he noticed one or two white coloured bricks
on most sides of
the house.  Mrs Kettley stated the lower section under the silver part was dark
and the higher section was all a
very light brown colour.  There was
conflicting evidence.  Mr Stevenson's evidence differed from Mr Osmond's.  The
Magistrate was
entitled to conclude that Mr and Mrs Kettley gave similar
evidence.  Mr Osmond gave evidence that he did not observe any damage or
fretting to the brickwork of the house while he was living there (t 83).  Mr
Stevenson gave evidence that he noticed a bit of discolouration
in the external
brickwork but thought it was caused by water which had flowed beneath the house
but did not feel that it was significant
(t 89).  There is no basis for
concluding that in so far as the Magistrate preferred the evidence of Mr and
Mrs Kettley she failed
to use or palpably misused the advantage which she had
of seeing and hearing the witnesses.  She preferred the eye witnesses evidence
over that of the experts who saw the brickwork years later and then conjectured
as to what they thought would have been visible in
1991.  She makes this clear.
The Magistrate was entitled to prefer the evidence of two eye witnesses whose
evidence was similar.
 I am not satisfied that the Magistrate has erred in
law.
<P>

16	The second issue determined was would such decay as was ascertainable on a
visual inspection have been sufficient to cause a
reasonably prudent builder
providing a pre-purchase inspection report to advise the intending purchaser
that there was a problem
with the property in the nature of that pleaded by the
plaintiff?  The learned Magistrate found that:  on one hand Mr Grainger, the
expert qualified for the defendant, was of the opinion that specific comment
was not demanded of the Builder/Inspector in 1991 concerning
the then
presenting aspects of the brickwork, and on the other hand, Mr Muldovan, the
expert qualified for the plaintiff, was of
the opinion that such specific
comment was demanded.  The Magistrate held that a prudent builder would have
alerted the purchaser/s
to the discoloured bricks and advised them as to the
possible causes(s) and what further steps could be taken to reach a diagnosis
of the problem.  The appellant submitted that the Magistrate erred by failing
to give any reasons, or adequate reasons, for her finding
that a prudent
builder would have alerted the intending purchaser(s) (plaintiffs) to the
discoloured bricks and advised them as to
possible cause or causes.
<P>

17	Although this does not appear in the agreed issues, it appears that it was
accepted by the parties that the defendant owed the
plaintiff a duty of care.
In relation to expert opinion, the Magistrate stated that the court needed to
look at the evidence of Mr
Stevenson and the opinions of two experts in
relation to the building industry's knowledge of efflorescence in 1991 and at
all times
keep in mind the purpose and reasoning behind the obtaining of a
builders' pre-purchase inspection report.  She summarised the evidence
of these
experts and concluded that she did not find Mr Muldovan's report useful.  The
learned Magistrate came to the view that the
expectation of the community, both
at large and the building consulting community, is that they would report on
significant items
and the skill to be exercised by the building consultant is
identifying and separating which item is significant and which is not.
 It was
common ground that the expert did not mention the discoloured bricks below the
damp course or the possibility of efflorescence.
 There was a conflict between
the experts.  It is accepted that the standard of care  to be observed by a
person with special skill
or competence is that of the ordinary skilled person
exercising and professing to have such skill.  But the standard is not
determined
solely or even primarily by the reference to the practice followed
or supported by a responsible body of opinion in the relevant
possession or
trade.  These expert opinions have an influential, often decisive role to play
in determining the appropriate standard
of care - see <b><u>Rogers v
Whitaker</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 479</a> at 487.  It was open to the Magistrate to
prefer one view over the other, or indeed come to her own view as to the
appropriate standard
of care.  The Magistrate accepted the view of Mr Muldovan
which she was entitled to do.  I am not persuaded that the Magistrate has
erred
in law.
<P>

18	The third issue determined was, did the defendant exercise all due
professional skill, care and diligence in inspecting and reporting
on the
property?  The Magistrate made a finding that the defendant did not exercise
all due professional skill, care and diligence
in inspecting and reporting on
the property.
<P>

19	The appellant submitted that the Magistrate erred by failing to give any
reasons, or adequate reasons, for her finding that the
defendant did not
exercise all due professional skill, care and diligence in inspecting and
reporting on the property.  It was common
ground that Mr Stevenson in his
report made no reference to the discoloured bricks nor what further steps could
be taken to reach
a diagnosis of the problem.  The Magistrate decided that such
a specific comment was demanded.  It follows that the opinion provided
in the
defendant's report fell below that standard of care and breached the duty of
care he owed the plaintiffs.  The damage was
agreed.  The defendant was found
to be negligent.  The Magistrate was entitled to make the finding that the
defendant did not exercise
all professional skill care and diligence in
inspecting and reporting on the property.  I am not persuaded that the
Magistrate has
erred in law.  The appellant/defendant has not discharged his
onus and satisfied me that the Magistrate has given inadequate reasons.
 The
Magistrate had indicated her processes of reasoning to a conclusion on disputed
facts and there is no reason for this court
to interfere with her decision.  I
affirm the determination in respect of which the case was stated.  I dismiss
the summons.  The
appellant is to pay the respondents' costs.
<P>

20	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	I affirm the Magistrate's determination in respect of which the case was
stated.
<P>

(2)	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The appellant is to pay the respondents' costs.
