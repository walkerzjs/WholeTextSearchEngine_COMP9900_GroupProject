<b>JUDGMENT</b> (<b>T2878 - admissibility - evidence of particular impact of
imputations</b>)
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  Mr Heads is presently giving evidence.  He is
a sports writer and journalist who, for present purposes, can be
taken as
having had substantial experience with respect to the sport of rugby league.
<P>

2   	He has given evidence to the effect that as at March 1995
the plaintiff had a good reputation and was seen as a strong and
passionate
contributor to that sport.
<P>

3   	The circle established on the evidence appears to be
founded upon regular contact with the plaintiff and knowledge of the
plaintiff's
involvement in the promotion of a Campbelltown rugby league team
into what is described as the major league and the plaintiff's stance
relating
to themes relating to Campbelltown.
<P>

4   	The question was asked of Mr Heads as follows:
<P>

<i>"Q.	As a regular rugby league writer and based on your association with
people concerned with rugby league in New South Wales, do
you have a view of
the ethical standards which people involved in rugby league should
observe?"</i>
<P>

5   	Objection was taken to that question.
<P>

6   	The witness had given evidence that his acquaintance with
the reputation of the plaintiff was in the circle described by the
witness, as
"<i>rugby league officialdom principally"</i>.  In common with other
evidentiary matters in this trial, the issue highlighted by the question and
the objection taken to it focuses
upon both principle and the state of the
evidence.
<P>

7   	For the plaintiff, it is contended that this evidence falls
into the category of evidence held to be admissible by the High
Court in<b>
<i>Readers Digest Services Pty Limited and Another v Lamb</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%2d2%29%20150%20CLR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981-2) 150
CLR 500.</a>  It is evidence also of the kind given by Father Confeggi and recorded
at pages 2495-6 of the transcript of the proceedings on 25
November 1999.
<P>

8   	Father Confeggi was asked by Mr Donohoe at line 38 on 2495
the question:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Now by virtue of your training did you, yourself, have a view as to the
ethical standards which Catholics should observe in relation
to matters of
homosexual intercourse with persons under the age of legal consent?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Yes."</i>
<P>

9   	Father Confeggi gave evidence as to his knowledge of Mr
Marsden not having been otherwise than a Catholic throughout his life,
and then
answered a series of questions founded upon the imputations the jury in this
trial concluded were in fact carried by the
program sued upon.
<P>

10   	By way of example, on page 2496:
<P>

<i>"Q.	I want you to assume that the first program imputed that Mr Marsden had
had sexual intercourse with a 15 year old boy who was
then under the influence
of drugs which had been given to him by Mr Marsden, do you have a view as to
whether or not that conduct
meets the ethical standards which you regard as
necessary to be observed by Catholics?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would be totally inappropriate, immoral and criminal".</i>
<P>

11   	The decision of the High Court in Lamb's case can be
understood as establishing that evidence is admissible on the issue of
a
particular impact of the defamatory imputation. At page 507 Brennan J said:
<P>

<i>"In making its assessment a jury is properly assisted by evidence that the
making of the defamatory imputation found by them had an
especially adverse
impact upon the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of some group or class in
the community.  Of course care must
be taken to ensure that evidence of the
attitude of particular groups of classes is not misused.  It is neither
material to nor admissible
upon the issue of the defamatory nature of the
imputation made. The defamatory nature of an imputation is ascertained by
reference
to general community standards not by reference to sectional
attitudes, but if the imputation is defamatory according to the standards
of
the community generally, a particular impact of the defamatory imputation may
be proved."</i>
<P>

12   	In <b><i>Lamb's</i></b> case it must be observed first
that the plaintiff was a journalist; second, that the imputations were as
pleaded and, as were still
on the record at the time of the relevant evidence,
was given as follows:
<P>

<i>1.	The plaintiff betrayed the confidence of an old friend who had turned to
him at a time of dire personal distress;</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The plaintiff, in order to secure a sensational newspaper story,
exploited the tragedy that had befallen an old friend.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	That the plaintiff for journalistic ends obstructed the course of the
police inquiry concerning the disappearance of Mrs Muriel
McKay.</i>
<P>

13   	These imputations are set out on page 503.  In the end the
second only of the imputations was found by the jury and an award
of damages
was made.
<P>

14   	Next, it is to be observed that the High Court was
concerned with the admissibility of evidence from three people:  the plaintiff
himself, Mr <b><i>Lamb</i></b> - that situation has not arisen in this case.
More to the point was the evidence of two other persons, Mr Murdoch and Mr
Hogben,
both of whom were journalists.  In that context the basis of
admissibility was as stated by Brennan J.
<P>

15   	In the present case, and this is stressed by the
defendant, the imputations as found by the jury, without questioning what
they
mean, which is impermissible, without questioning that they were otherwise
found by the jury based  upon their understanding
of what the community as a
whole would have understood the telecasts to be conveying, are of a general
nature, in the sense that
when compared to the imputations in
<b><i>Lamb's</i></b> case, do not directly, in their terms, relate to the
conduct of the plaintiff as a rugby league person in the same way that the
imputations,
in respect of which the evidence ultimately was allowed in Lamb
can be viewed as relating to the plaintiff in that litigation as
a
journalist.
<P>

16   	Further, on the evidence in its present state, we have the
witness's evidence as to the plaintiff's reputation in rugby league
circles as
has been described by him which I understood to be principally rugby league
officialdom.  Thus it is submitted, as I understand
it for the defendant, what
I will describe either as a presence of too broad a generality or the absence
of a more refined focus,
as was applicable in <b><i>Lamb's</i></b> case.
<P>

17   	If the principle in <b><i>Lamb's</i></b> case is
understood in accordance with how Brennan J stated it, a particular impact of
the defamatory imputation may be proved in
the context in which his Honour made
that statement and the notion of "<i>generality"</i>, I do not consider would
exclude such evidence. The particular impact of the found defamatory
imputations may be proved in relation
to the plaintiff in respect of whom there
is evidence that as at 1995 he enjoyed a good reputation in the area I have
described.
 Thus, as a matter of principle, I see no basis for its
exclusion.
<P>

18   	Mr Heads certainly, according to the evidence at present,
has had extensive experience as a rugby league and sporting journalist
and been
connected in that role with both newspapers generally, and specialist rugby
league publications.
<P>

19   	Insofar as the knowledge of the plaintiff's reputation
with "<i>rugby league officialdom principally" </i>has been the focus of his
evidence, whether or not it has been established through the witness that he,
vis-a-vis rugby league officialdom,
is in a position to answer the question is
at best very unclear.  To explain that one need say no more than of course
Father Confeggi
was a practising Roman Catholic priest.
<P>

20   	At this stage, on the state of the evidence, whilst
evidence of the kind sought to be tendered I have ruled as a matter of
principle would be admissible, I am not persuaded that sufficient groundwork
has been laid for the question asked, and I will reject
the question.
