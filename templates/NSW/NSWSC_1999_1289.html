<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>21 December 1999</b>
<P>

1   	ASIC by summons dated 21 December 1999 seeks an injunction
to restrain the holding of a meeting of participants from what I
will describe
in this judgment and the orders as "the First TrackNet Project".  Essentially
what is proposed at a meeting of participants
in a prescribed interest scheme
is a replacement of that scheme with the attendant winding up of what is
defined as "the Project"
and instead the issuance of shares in a new public
company, TNL, to a Trustee to be held subject to the conditions of the
resolution
pro rata for the Participants.  The Project essentially involves the
exploitation of a tracking system technology for vehicles and
is currently held
by a corporation TrackNet Australia Pty Limited ("TPL") for the
participants.
<P>

2   	ASIC, as is conceded, have made out an arguable case that
the relevant material by way of the manager's explanatory notes forming
part of
the Notice of General Meeting contravenes the law.  There is also the
possibility that the issuance of shares in TNL to be
effected by these
proposals and in turn associated with an offer of the relevant shares to the
Trustee should have been carried out
by a prospectus.  I do not express a
concluded view on the matter since it goes to balance of convenience rather
than being one of
the matters relied on by ASIC in its Summons.
<P>

3   	Ordinarily, where there was an arguable case of a serious
contravention of the law in making adequate disclosure to participants
an
injunction would follow unless there were compelling reasons based on the
balance of convenience and which still preserved the
application of the law.
In the orders which follow and which are made by consent, I have granted the
injunction sought but have provided
for that injunction to operate unless
certain events have occurred.  The nature of those events are intended to
safeguard the policy
of the law and its proper enforcement as well as to
recognise one matter of substantial significance in the present case.  
<P>

4   	That matter is this.  The Defendant has indicated that it
is confident that further affidavits will be forthcoming from participants
representing in excess of 75% of the total relevant interests which will affirm
that upon their having been advised of the matters
requiring, in ASIC's view,
express disclosure, they would still intend to vote or direct a proxy to vote
in favour of all the relevant
resolutions, thus in effect affirming what has
been stated in a series of affidavits from such participants dated 21 December
1999
filed to-day.
<P>

5   	It is also recognised by the Defendant that ASIC must grant
its approval to the relevant amending deed to the trust deed and
that the
Defendant would withdraw any application for its approval in the event that
ASIC concluded, based on Senior Counsel advice
and take into account any
relevant aspects of ASIC policy:
<P>

(a)	That the circumstances of the meeting failed to comply with the
Corporations Law, and
<P>

(b)	That having regard to all relevant circumstances including the further
affidavits contemplated it would not excuse such non-compliance.
<P>

6   	In regard to the foregoing it may be expected that ASIC
would apply a common sense approach having regard to the present commercial
situation in which it appears that, based on what is said at page 40 of GDP1
there are no net tangible assets or scheme property
other than the technology
presently in the Project and the alternative though speculative depended on
tomorrow's meeting not being
delayed and may represent the best thing going.
That of course is a matter for ASIC to consider based on the circumstances as
may
emerge including any issue regarding entitlements of Participants to
vote.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

Not by consent:
<P>

1.	ASIC's costs of this application shall be paid by the Defendant.
<P>

By consent:
<P>

1.	An order pursuant to s1324 of the <i>Corporations Law</i> that the Second
Defendant not hold the meeting convened for 9.30 am on 22 December 1999, by the
Second Defendant, of participants
in the First TrackNet Project, being a
project constituted by a deed dated 12 December 1997 unless the following has
first occurred:
<P>

(a)	affidavits shall be provided by participants constituting not less than the
majority required by s1069A(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> as applicable in
respect of the relevant meeting being in each case participants entitled to
vote to the following effect:
<P>

(i)	that the deponent has been provided with ASIC's letter of 13 December 1999
and such additional information as would inform the
deponent accurately of the
true position or is otherwise already aware of that additional information and
of the true position, such
that the deponent is satisfied that it has been
adequately informed of the subject matter of the meeting so as not to be misled
or
deceived within the meaning of s995 of the Corporations Law, and
<P>

(ii)	it has been informed of these orders and this judgment, and
<P>

(iii)	taking (i) and (ii) into account, the deponent intends to vote or
alternatively direct a proxy to vote in favour of all of
the resolutions set
out in annexure "A" at the general meeting of Participants to be held on
Wednesday 22 December 1999 or as it
may be adjourned.
<P>

(b)	That subject to the relevant resolutions being passed, each of TPL, TNL,
the Second Defendant and Springsley Pty Limited undertake
for each of
themselves to consent to all matters and take all such steps as are within its
power to effect the fulfilment of the
conditions and elements of the proposal
before the meeting of 22 December 1999 and of the transactions contemplated
thereby including
without limiting the generality of the foregoing placing the
Participants in the equivalent position mutatis mutandis and subject
to the
proviso which follows, so far as access to contracts, property or rights are
concerned as they are under the present arrangements
provided that their
interest will be held via a direct shareholding in TNL and which will in turn
own TPL or all of its assets and
undertaking and which will likewise own Halion
Pty Limited and Garrison Monitoring Pty Limited directly or through a
wholly-owned
subsidiary.  In the event that the amending deed to the trust deed
in relation to the scheme is not approved by ASIC and subject
to the existing
Project not having been terminated, the foregoing undertaking will cease to
have effect.
<P>

(c)	The First Defendant undertakes that it will withdraw the amending deed and
not seek the approval of such an amending deed in
the event that either the
foregoing undertaking is not complied with save as waived by ASIC, or in the
event that ASIC concludes,
based on Senior Counsel's opinion (to be obtained at
the Defendants' expense) and ASIC policy, 
<P>

(i)	that the circumstances of the meeting failed to comply with the
Corporations Law, and
<P>

(ii)	that having regard to all relevant circumstances including the further
affidavits contemplated it would not excuse such non-compliance.
<P>

2.	The foregoing undertakings though given to the Court are also given to ASIC
and the relevant affidavits shall be furnished to
ASIC and filed in due
course.
<P>

3.	Leave to apply on reasonable notice.
<P>
