<b>v  THE OWNERS STRATA PLAN 22481</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	Christopher William Crawley appeals by way of case stated
against a determination of Mr G Keenan as a member of the Strata
Schemes Board
that he did not have jurisdiction to determine appeals against orders made by
the Strata Titles Commissioner in proceedings
which commenced prior to 1 July
1997 in respect of applications 105(1) 471/97, 105(1) 479/97, 106/480/97 and
106/635/97 and which
had not been determined or finalised prior to that day.

<P>

2   	Whether the Strata Schemes Board has jurisdiction depends
upon the construction of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act </i>1996</a> and
especially Schedule 4, Savings, transitional and other provisions.  Mr Keenan
held that in respect of proceedings commenced prior
to 1 July 1997 in which
orders were made after that date by the Commissioner of Strata Titles any
appeal against those orders lay
to the Strata Titles Board.  Legislation which
came into operation on 1 July 1997 substitutes Adjudicators for the
Commissioner in
respect of the hearing and resolution of disputes and provides
for appeals to go to the Strata Schemes Board.  The previous provision
for
appeals from the Commissioner to the Strata Titles Board was repealed.
<P>

<b><i>The Facts</i></b>
<P>

3   	Mr Crawley is the registered proprietor of Lot 71, Strata
Plan 22481, being premises on the ground floor of a commercial/residential
building at 533-539 Kent Street Sydney.  The strata plan covers the whole
building.  The appellant has development approval and building
approval from
Sydney City Council to convert his premises to a restaurant/bar.  In
implementing those consents the Proprietors SP
22481 (the Proprietors) contend
that Mr Crawley is damaging the common property in breach of a by-law made
pursuant to s58 of the
<i>Strata Titles Act </i>1973 (retitled the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata
Schemes (Freehold Development) Act </i>1973</a>).  That by-law applied to the
building.
<P>

4   	The following applications were made to the Strata Titles
Commissioner under the <i>Strata Titles Act </i>1973:<i>  </i>
<P>

(a)	On 29 April 1997 by the Proprietors for an order that Mr Crawley refrain
from breaking by-law 16 by damaging a common property
floor, walls and columns
and rectify the damage done by him in breach of the by-law.
<P>

(b)	On 1 May 1997 by Mr Crawley:
<P>

(i)	for an order requiring the Proprietors to deliver a written approval, under
by-law 16 to him for the works the subject of the
Development Approval and the
Building Approval insofar as such works affect the common property;
<P>

(ii)	alternatively, for an order requiring the Proprietors to consent to him
effecting alterations to the common property in accordance
with such
Approvals.
<P>

(c)	On 3 June 1997 by Mr Crawley for an order requiring the Proprietors to
consent to him effecting alterations to the common property
in accordance with
such Council Approvals.
<P>

5   	On 15 August 1997 the Strata Titles Commissioner made these
orders:
<P>

(a)	an order requiring Mr Crawley to comply with by-law 16 of Schedule 1 to the
Act of 1973 and to refrain from breaching by-law
16 by damaging a common
property floor, walls and columns, and rectify the damage done by him in breach
of the by-law; compliance
with that order being required by 10 October 1997.
<P>

(b)	An order dismissing each of Mr Crawley's applications.
<P>

6   	On 2 September 1997 Mr Crawley filed appeals against the
orders made by the Strata Titles Commissioner in each case with the
office of
the Strata Schemes Board.  The forms completed by Mr Crawley stated that he was
applying for:
<P>

"An appeal against an order of an Adjudicator (sec 177)"
<P>

7   	This was an obvious reference to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
Management Act</i> 1996</a>.
<P>

<b><i>Statutory Background</i></b>
<P>

8   	For many years the <i>Strata Titles Act </i>1973<i>
</i>governed strata titles and the resolution of disputes between proprietors
and the body corporate, amongst others.  Procedures were
specified and the
Commissioner had power to make certain orders. An appeal lay to a Strata Titles
Board. It could admit further evidence,
and it could affirm, vary or revoke the
order under appeal.  An appeal lay from a Board to the Supreme Court on a
question of law.
 The provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss101</a> to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s110.html" class="autolink_findacts">110</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act
</i>1902</a> as to appeals were incorporated.
<P>

9   	In December 1996 the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act
</i>1996</a> and the <i>Strata Schemes Management (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act
</i>1996 were assented to.  They are complimentary and came into force on 1
July 1997.  The objects of the former Act were stated to be:
<P>

(a)	to provide for the management of strata schemes created under the <i>Strata
Titles (Freehold Development) Act</i> 1973 or the <i>Strata Titles (Leasehold
Development) Act</i> 1986, and 
<P>

(b)	to provide for the resolution of disputes arising in connection with the
management of strata schemes.
<P>

10   	Chapter 5 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act</a> deals with
disputes and their resolution.  Adjudicators are empowered to make orders on a
fairly wide range of matters.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s177.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 177</a> provides that an appeal lies to the
Strata Schemes Board against an order made by an adjudicator.
<P>

11   	The Strata Schemes Management (Miscellaneous Amendments)
Act 1996 made extensive amendments to the Strata Titles Act 1973.
 The latter
Act was renamed the Strata Titles (Freehold Development) Act 1973.  Significant
portions of that Act including Part 5
headed "Disputes" were omitted.  The
title of the 1973 Act was further amended by Item 3 of clause 2.27 of Schedule
2 of Act No 147
of 1997 to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act 1973</a>. 
<P>

<b><i>Clauses 3 and 4 of Schedule 4</i></b>
<P>

12   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s247.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 247</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act</i>
1996</a> provided that Schedule 4 had effect.  It is headed "Savings, transitional
and other provisions".  Schedule 4 contained obvious drafting
errors but it was
clear what was meant.  The errors were corrected by items [1] and [2] of clause
2.26 of Schedule 2 to Act No 147
of 1997 (<i>Statute Law (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act (No 2)</i> 1997).  These amendments commenced on 17 December
1997 the date of assent, as provided in s2(2) of that Act.  
<P>

13   	As clause 3 of Schedule 4 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
Management Act</i> 1996</a>, as originally passed, would have been construed to
mean or read what the corrected and amended version states, it is sufficient
to
set out the latter and clause 4:
<P>

"3	Pending proceedings and applications
<P>

Any proceedings commenced but not determined or finalised under provisions of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act 1973</a> or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1986351/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
(Leasehold Development) Act 1986</a> repealed by the Strata Schemes Management
(Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1996 may be dealt with and determined as if that
Act had
not been amended by the Strata Schemes Management (Miscellaneous
Amendments) Act 1996.
<P>

4	Previous orders made by Commissioner or a board
<P>

(1)	An order made by the Commissioner or a strata titles board under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata
Schemes (Freehold Development) Act 1973</a> or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1986351/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Leasehold
Development) Act 1986</a> is taken to be have been made by an Adjudicator or the
Strata Schemes Board under the corresponding provision of this Act.  
<P>

(2)	Despite subclause (1):
<P>

(a)	 Part 6 of Chapter 5 of this Act does not apply to such an order, and
<P>

(b)	the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act</i> 1973</a>
and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1986351/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Leasehold Development) Act</i> 1986</a> relating to the
contravention of orders as in force immediately before their repeal continue to
apply to such an order."
<P>

14   	Mr Keenan took the view that clause 3 was "absolutely
central to and ultimately determinant of the question of jurisdiction
in
matters such as those that came before me".  I do not agree.  It would be
important if Mr Crawley had contended that he had instituted
an appeal to the
Strata Titles Board.  The prime question is whether clause 4 or any other
provision permits Mr Crawley to appeal
to the Strata Schemes Board when regard
is had to the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act</i> 1996</a>.  
<P>

15   	Mr Keenan in rejecting the submission that clause 4 of
Schedule 4 when combined with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s177.html" class="autolink_findacts">s177</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act</i>
1996</a> had the effect of enabling Mr Crawley to appeal to the Strata Schemes
Board relied on anomalies that would result.  He wrote:
<P>

"For example, under the 1973 Act a Strata Titles Board could make orders under
sections 120, 120A, 121, 122, 122A, 123, 124, 125,
126 and 127; the
corresponding provisions under the 1996 Act are contained in sections 157, 158,
144, 159, 153, 149, 154, 147, 161
and 162 respectively - these sections provide
that the relevant orders may be made by an Adjudicator.  Under the provisions
of clause
4 of Schedule 4, therefore, any order that might have been made by a
Strata Titles Board under any of the enumerated sections of
the 1973 Act would
be taken to have been made by an Adjudicator under the enumerated corresponding
provisions of the 1996 Act.  On
the appellant's submission, therefore, any
appeal against any such order of a Strata Titles Board would be to the Strata
Schemes
Board under section 178 of the Act - surely a result that could not
have been intended by Parliament."  
<P>

16   	Three comments should be made.  Firstly, there are
instances under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act</i> 1996</a> where orders made
by the Strata Schemes Board correspond with orders that could have been made by
the Strata Titles Board under the
1973 Act.  Secondly, the true equation under
Schedule 4 clause 4 is between orders made by the Commissioner and those made
by an
Adjudicator on the one hand, and between orders made by the Strata Titles
Board and the Strata Schemes Board on the other.  Thirdly,
the anomaly is not
of much consequence and is unlikely to affect many cases given the time limits
on appeals in s178.  The anomaly,
if it exists, is not such as to require a
restrictive interpretation of clause 4 of Schedule 4.  
<P>

17   	Mr Keenan summarised his views of clauses 3 and 4 of the
Schedule thus:
<P>

"Clause 3 ... was ... intended ... to be a transitional provision to allow
for:
<P>

(i)	determination under the provisions of Part 5 of the 1973 Act of proceedings
that had been commenced under that Act, and
<P>

(ii)	finalisation under those provisions either by effluxion of time or by
utilisation of relevant appeal processes.
<P>

Clause 4 is a savings provision and serves to put beyond doubt any question as
to the efficacy of orders made under the provisions
of the 1973 Act which were
extant on 30 June 1997."
<P>

18   	Clause 3 covers cases where proceedings have been
commenced but not completed as at 30 June 1997.  Those proceedings continue
under the <i>Strata Titles Act</i>.  They would include pending proceedings
before a Commissioner or a Strata Titles Board as at 30 June 1997.  
<P>

19   	I do not regard the primary purpose of clause 4 as being
to put beyond doubt any question as to the efficacy of orders previously
made.
It is true that clause 4(2) of Schedule 4 renders the enforcement provisions of
Part 6 of the 1996 Act as to the orders of
Adjudicators and the Board
inapplicable and preserves the provisions of the 1973 and 1986 Acts relating to
contraventions of orders
as in force immediately before the repeal of those
Acts.  Clause 4(2) has a different and wider scope.  Amongst other things,
orders
made by the Commissioner after 1 July 1997 in respect of proceedings
commenced prior to that date are taken to have been made by
an Adjudicator.
Clause 4 of Schedule 4 is of importance when questions of variation or
revocation of orders made by a Commissioner
or a Strata Titles Board arise or
such applications are made (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s171.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss171</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s189.html" class="autolink_findacts">189</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s191.html" class="autolink_findacts">191</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
Management Act</i> 1996</a>).  Clause 4 facilitates the future conduct of strata
scheme business.  Subject to the exceptions contained in clause 4(2), clause
4
should be regarded as an assimilating provision, bringing what was done under
the <i>Strata Titles Act</i> into line with the new regime under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata
Schemes Management Act</a></i> and enabling a smooth change over.  Vested rights
are not destroyed.  
<P>

20   	This is not a case of removing the right of appeal but of
deciding to which Board or Boards an appeal lies from the Commissioner.
 What
is at issue is a procedural matter.  
<P>

21   	On its correct construction, clause 4 of Schedule 4
confers on Mr Crawley the right to appeal from the Commissioner to the
Strata
Schemes Board.  I do not propose to express a final view on clause 3 of
Schedule 4.  That is best left until the jurisdiction
of the Strata Titles
Board is challenged upon an appeal from the Commissioner to that Board in
respect of proceedings commenced but
not determined prior to 1 July 1997.  As
at present advised, my provisional view is that there is no appeal to the
Strata Titles
Board in such circumstances.  There is much to be said for the
view that clause 3 applies to proceedings before the Commissioner,
the Strata
Titles Board or before the Court on appeal by case stated pending but not
concluded as at 1 July 1997 but not to appeals
instituted after 1 July 1997.
In my opinion Mr Keenan erred in his construction of clause 4 of Schedule 4.
He did and does have jurisdiction
as a member of the Strata Schemes Board to
hear Mr Crawley's appeals.  
<P>

22   	Mr Keenan declined to follow an earlier decision of this
Court in <i>The Owners Strata Plan No 52896 v Goldbind Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</i>
(1 May 1998, Bruce J, unreported).  It was there held that clause 4(1) gave
jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s177.html" class="autolink_findacts">s177</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act</i> 1996</a> to the
Strata Schemes Board to hear an appeal from the Commissioner where the
proceedings before the Commissioner commenced prior
to 1 July 1997 and he made
an order on 28 July 1997.  Despite Mr Keenan's misgivings about that decision,
he was bound by it and
should have followed it.  
<P>

23   	Mr Crawley further contended that if there were any doubt
on the correct construction of clause 4 of Schedule 4, his right
of appeal to a
Strata Schemes Board was put beyond doubt by the passage of the <i>Strata
Schemes Amendment (Transitional) Regulation </i>1997, gazetted on 21 November
1997, which reads:
<P>

"Clause 28
<P>

Insert after clause 27:

28	Appeals from orders of Commissioner

provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act</i> 1973</a> or the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1986351/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Leasehold Development) Act</i> 1986</a>:

(a)	that was lodged after the commencement of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management

(b)	that has not been determined as at the commencement of this clause,

Management Act</i> 1996</a>."
<P>

24   	Mr Keenan took the view that the regulation was invalid in
that it was at variance with the positive provisions made by the
Act, for
example, clause 3 of Schedule 4 to the Act.  
<P>

25   	The regulation in question was not made pursuant to the
general regulation making power in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s246.html" class="autolink_findacts">s246</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management

1	Regulations
<P>

(1)	The regulations may contain provisions of a savings or transitional nature
consequent on the enactment of the following Acts:
<P>

this Act"
<P>

26   	This clause does not contain the provision in s246(1) that
the Governor may make regulations not inconsistent with the 1996
Act.  Clause 1
of Schedule 4 is a different kind of provision from the usual section
empowering the making of regulations.  Clause
1 permits the regulation made
thereunder to deal with a matter of substance, namely provisions of a savings
or transitional nature
consequent on the enactment of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
Management Act</i> 1996</a>.  Provisions such as clause 1 of Schedule 4 are not
uncommon, especially when deal with savings and transitional provisions.  So
often these need to be amended or supplemented.  
<P>

27   	There is no good reason why full effect should not be
given to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 28.</a>  I do not regard it as invalid or ineffective.  
<P>

28   	At the commencement of the hearing of the case stated, the
solicitor for the proprietors advised that advice of counsel had
been taken and
that after careful consideration the proprietors did not feel able to support
the view of the law propounded by Mr
Keenan.  
<P>

29   	The course of these proceedings has been unhappy.  Mr
Keenan raised the question of jurisdiction.  He later declined to follow
a
decision of this Court.  Unnecessary expense has been incurred and the parties
have been delayed in obtaining a determination on
the merits.  
<P>

30   	I answer the question raised in the case stated, namely
whether the determination of Mr G Keenan, Strata Schemes Board, was
erroneous
in the affirmative.  The case stated is remitted to the Strata Schemes Board to
hear and determine.  
<P>

31   	No specific submissions were put as to costs.  The hearing
was much shortened by the course taken by the proprietors.  Costs
were sought
in the summons.  I order the proprietors of Strata Plan 22481 to pay Mr
Crawley's costs.  If eligible, the proprietors
should have a certificate under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</i> 1951</a>.  The order for costs is not to be entered
for ten days to allow either party to put submissions as to a different order.

<P>
