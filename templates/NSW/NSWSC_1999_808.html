<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 4 August 1999;  revised 5 August 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff, New Cap Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd
(Provisional Liquidator Appointed) (`New Cap Bermuda') is a reinsurer
formed
and licensed in Bermuda.  It is not registered as a foreign company in
Australia, though it is a `supervised body corporate'
for the purposes of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Act 1973</a> (Cth) as it is a company connected with an Australian
authorised insurer: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 3</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s49a.html" class="autolink_findacts">49A</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">49B</a>.  Its parent, New Cap Reinsurance
Corporation Holdings Ltd, was also formed in Bermuda but it is registered as a
foreign company
in Australia and has been listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange.  
<P>

2  	On 22 April 1999 John McKenna, of Ernst &amp; Young in Bermuda,
was appointed provisional liquidator of the plaintiff by the
Supreme Court of
Bermuda in proceedings to wind up the plaintiff for insolvency and on the just
and equitable ground.  On 3 June
1999 Young J appointed John Gibbons, of Ernst
&amp; Young in Sydney, to be the plaintiff's Australian provisional liquidator
in proceedings
brought by the present plaintiff (in provisional liquidation)
and Mr McKenna as a provisional liquidator (see  <i>Re New Cap Reinsurance
Corporation Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2017%20ACLC%201024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 17 ACLC 1024).</a> In doing so he took into
account a letter of request by the Supreme Court of Bermuda made under s 581(3)
of the Corporations Law
and found that the plaintiff carried on business in New
South Wales and Victoria and was, therefore, a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/index.html#p5.7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.7</a> body for the purposes of
Corporations Law.  An order for the appointment of provisional liquidators has
also been made in the United
Kingdom and temporary restraining orders have been
obtained in New York.
<P>

3  	The reasons why Mr McKenna sought the appointment of an
Australian provisional liquidator should be noted.  They are set out
in his
affidavit in support of the application heard by Young J.  The plaintiff has
acted as reinsurer for some Australian companies
and may have substantial
assets and security arrangements in Australia.  It has a quota share treaty in
place with its Australian
sister subsidiary, and has obtained retrocessional
coverage with Australian reinsurers.  Various contracts have involved
Australian
brokers.  In those circumstances Mr McKenna's view was that an
Australian provisional liquidator could locate and get in Australian
assets and
corporate records, make investigations and take other steps to protect the
company's Australian assets, and deal with
the company's bankers (The Chase
Manhattan Bank in Sydney) whom Mr McKenna had attempted to contact without
success.  Further, the
appointment of an Australian provisional liquidator
would prevent and stay proceedings against the plaintiff, giving time for the
Australian  provisional liquidator and Mr McKenna to investigate various
matters including the inter-corporate relationships between
the plaintiff and
the Australian subsidiary.  This might assist the provisional liquidators to
deal with the Australian creditors
and to prevent creditors from taking
precipitous actions in drawing down letters of credit. Mr McKenna said that he
intended that
the Australian provisional liquidator would be ancillary to the
proceedings in Bermuda.
<P>

4  	In the present proceedings, brought by summons filed on 21 June
1999, the plaintiff is New Cap Bermuda and the defendants are
The Chase
Manhattan Bank (`Chase') and Chase Capital Markets Fiduciary Services Australia
Ltd (`Chase Fiduciary Services').  Neither
the Bermudan nor the Australian
provisional liquidator is a party.  The plaintiff seeks orders to the effect
that the defendants
hold no security interest in respect of certain assets,
including a USD107 million account held in Chase's Sydney branch.  Essentially,
the plaintiff contends that the charging clause in a security document called
the `Collateral Agreement', as amended, does not on
its proper construction
provide security for either defendant with respect to the plaintiff's assets
including the USD account. 

<P>

5  	From 21 June 1999 until 3 August 1999 the defendants were subject
to interlocutory orders given on the basis of a limited undertaking
and
acknowledgment by the plaintiff.  Replacement orders where made yesterday as I
shall explain.  
<P>

6  	On 20 July 1999, on the motion of Mr Gibbons as Australian
provisional liquidator in the Australian provisional liquidation
proceedings
for New Cap Bermuda, I gave directions under s 479(3) of the Corporations Law
that Mr Gibbons was justified in commencing
and prosecuting the present
proceedings and causing the plaintiff to provide an acknowledgment to the
defendants which I shall describe.
 I delivered my reasons for judgment on that
matter on 21 July 1999.
<P>

7  	The interlocutory orders in the present proceedings, as extended
on several occasions, restrained the defendants until 5pm on
3 August 1999 from
altering the existing arrangements under which the rights and liabilities of
the parties under the Collateral
Agreement are administered, and the funds on
deposit on any account with Chase relating to the Collateral Agreement are
held; and
from exercising rights to replace Chase Fiduciary Services as the
collateral agent under the Collateral Agreement.  Although the
first order did
not prevent the defendants from taking such enforcement action against funds
held under the Collateral Agreement
as they may lawfully be entitled to take,
the practical effect of the interlocutory orders has been to require the
defendants to
retain in New South Wales or Victoria the assets held by the
defendants under the Collateral Agreement, which were in either of those
States
on 21 June 1999.  The interlocutory hearings in the present proceedings have
been conducted on the basis that those assets
included the USD107 million
account held with Chase's Sydney branch.  As the price for obtaining the
interlocutory orders, the plaintiff
has given an undertaking as to damages
which is limited to its assets in New South Wales and Victoria.
<P>

8  	By its application heard on 29 July 1999, the plaintiff  sought
to replace the interlocutory orders with similar though narrower
orders which
would operate until further orders rather than to a specified date.  The orders
which it sought on that day would restrain
the defendants from taking any step
which may have the effect that the location of the funds on deposit in the USD
account may be
moved outside New South Wales, otherwise than by exercising
certain specified powers which arise under the Collateral Agreement while
an
event of default is continuing.  They would restrain Chase from replacing Chase
Fiduciary Services as the collateral agent.
<P>

9  	At the hearing on 29 July 1999 the plaintiff offered the same
limited undertaking as was then in place.  In addition, consistently
with my
directions of 20 July 1999, the plaintiff offered an acknowledgment that if the
defendants successfully defend the proceedings,
any surplus collateral held by
them pursuant to the Collateral Agreement secures any obligation to the
plaintiff to pay damages pursuant
to the undertaking and any obligation to pay
costs awarded in the proceedings.  
<P>

10  	This acknowledgment was expressly sought by the defendants'
solicitors by letter of 14 July 1999.  In that letter the solicitors
asserted
that as the plaintiff was in default, they were entitled to enforce the
security by deploying the funds elsewhere at a higher
rate of return. They said
the measure of damages Chase may suffer by reason of continuance of the
injunction is the difference between
the return Chase is presently earning on
the investment and the return it would otherwise enjoy if it were able to
enforce the security.
 Chase estimated the loss in respect of the plaintiff to
be approximately USD280,000 per annum. The letter does not give any information
about the alternative investment which would produce a higher return for Chase
and, in particular, it does not say whether the higher
return could be obtained
if the location of the new investment were to remain in Australia.  This is a
significant issue because
the new orders sought by the plaintiff would allow
reinvestment provided the location of the investment remains in New South Wales
or Victoria.
<P>

11  	The solicitors required an undertaking by the plaintiff that the
surplus collateral held by the defendants, amounting to approximately
USD5.5
million, secures the plaintiff's obligation under the undertaking to pay
damages and may be used for payment of any costs
ordered to be paid by the
plaintiff.  The defendants' costs to that time, apparently not limited to the
present proceedings, were
estimated at USD450,000.  
<P>

12  	I do not express any view about the legal effect of an
acknowledgment that a fund secures an obligation arising under such
an
undertaking.  I note, however, that the defendants have not contended that the
acknowledgment offered by the plaintiff fails to
comply with the defendants'
solicitors' requirements in the letter of 14 July 1999.  To the extent that the
letter may have sought
a broader security with respect to costs other than the
legal costs of the present proceedings, I do not see how the provision of
such
a security would be justified in the context of undertakings and
acknowledgments given by the parties for the purpose of interlocutory
relief in
these proceedings.  In fact the acknowledgment offered by the plaintiff at the
hearing on 29 July 1999 was limited to costs
ordered to be paid by it in these
proceedings.
<P>

13  	The question for me to determine at the hearing on 29 July 1999
was whether the replacement interlocutory orders should be
made as proposed by
the plaintiff.  Counsel for the defendants expressed concern that for the
purposes of the plaintiff's undertaking,
the funds in the USD account with
Chase's Sydney branch may arguably not be an asset within New South Wales.  But
the plaintiff said
that the undertaking is intended to relate to those funds
whatever their situs, as a matter of technical legal analysis, may be;
 and
consequently the plaintiff proposed to amend the undertaking so that the assets
to which it was limited would specifically include
the funds on deposit in that
account.  I took the view that this amendment to the undertaking should be
made, to avoid doubt.  The
amendment having been made, it was clear that the
undertaking would be enforceable with respect to those funds including that
part
of the funds which is surplus capital.  After the hearing on 29 July 1999
I formed the view that, subject to one matter which I shall
explain later, the
interim orders sought by the plaintiffs should be made for the following
reasons.
<P>

14  	First, in my opinion, the plaintiff has raised a serious
question to be tried as to whether the security which the defendants
assert
over the plaintiff's Australian assets is valid and applicable to the USD
account.  I dealt with the plaintiff's case in my
reasons for judgment on Mr
Gibbons' application for directions, handed down on 21 July 1999.  I concluded
(at par 26) that important
issues of law and construction reasonably arise out
of the material before the Court, which included material concerning the
plaintiff's
claims in the present proceedings.  I took the view that the
Court's determination of those issues could have the effect that substantial
assets would be available to satisfy the claims of the plaintiff's unsecured
creditors.  My findings imply that the `serious question
to be tried' criterion
for interlocutory relief, expounded in such well-known cases as<b>
</b><i>Kolback Securities Limited v Epoch Mining NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 533</a>, is
satisfied.  No contrary submission was made at the hearing on 29 July 1999.  I
note that this is not a case where the decision
on interlocutory relief in a
practical sense will determine the substance of the matters in issue.
<P>

15  	The question was, therefore, one as to the balance of
convenience.  McLelland J said in<b> </b><i>Kolback</i> (at 535):
<P>

`Where a plaintiff's entitlement to ultimate relief is uncertain, the Court, in
deciding to grant or refuse an interlocutory injunction,
must consider what
course is best calculated to achieve justice between the parties in the
circumstances of the particular case,
pending the resolution of the
uncertainty, bearing in mind the consequence to the defendant of the granting
of an injunction in support
of relief to which the plaintiff may ultimately be
held not to be entitled, and the consequence to the plaintiff of the refusal of
an injunction in support of relief to which the plaintiff may ultimately be
held to be entitled...'
<P>

16  	In my view there are three factors which weigh in favour of the
plaintiff.  The first relates to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 116</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Act 1973</a> (Cth) which
states:
<P>

`In the winding up of a body corporate authorised under this Act to carry on
insurance business, or in the winding up of a  supervised
body corporate, the
assets in Australia of the body corporate shall not be applied in the discharge
of its liabilities other than
its liabilities in Australia unless it has no
liabilities in Australia.'
<P>

17  	The interpretation and application of this section is not a
simple matter, but its substantial effect is clear enough.  Once
the liquidator
of such a body corporate overcomes the difficulties involved in identifying its
assets and liabilities `in Australia',
those creditors have absolute priority,
over creditors whose liabilities are not `in Australia', to be satisfied out of
the assets
in Australia.
<P>

18  	The plaintiff is, as I have said, a supervised body corporate
for the purposes of this provision.  Prima facie, it appears
to have very
substantial assets in Australia, if one includes the USD account which is the
subject of the dispute in these proceedings.
 The USD account is maintained by
Chase's Sydney branch.  At least arguably, the chose in action constituted by
the account (if it
is a true bank deposit account), or the fund of USD107
million to which the account relates, is located within this State.  If the
plaintiff succeeds in the present proceedings it will hold this asset free from
any claim to security by the defendants. 
<P>

19  	There are also some inter-corporate loans and shareholdings with
respect to other New Cap group entities which are, at least
arguably, located
in Australia, and probably other operating assets of lesser value.  
<P>

20  	Thus, at the present time, if the plaintiff were to succeed in
the present proceedings and go into liquidation, its creditors
with Australian
liabilities would receive a priority which could well be a substantial
advantage to them, assuming that the plaintiff's
worldwide assets are
insufficient to pay unsecured creditors in full.  Pending determination of the
proceedings, it is desirable
to maintain the status quo by preventing the
defendants from taking steps which would alter the priority of Australian
liabilities
over non-Australian liabilities with respect to the most
substantial Australian asset, which is the very subject matter of the
proceedings.

<P>

21  	Although my reasoning on this issue is directed to the balance
of convenience on the facts of the present case, I see some
analogy between
this issue and the matters considered in<b> </b><i>Re Northland Services Pty
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2018%20ALR%20684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 18 ALR 684</a>;<b> </b><i>Re National Employers' Mutual General
Insurance Association Ltd (In Liq)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2015%20ACSR%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 15 ACSR 624</a>, 627; and<b>
</b><i>Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 10)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20Ch%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] Ch
213.</a>  
<P>

22  	Secondly, I take into account some recent developments in
litigation in Bermuda which affects New Cap Bermuda.  By a summons
dated 22
July 1999 and returnable on 12 August 1999, the present defendants seek orders
of the Supreme Court of Bermuda against Mr
McKenna as provisional liquidator of
the present plaintiff.  The orders would revoke the letter of request, partly
upon the basis
of which Young J made orders for the plaintiff's provisional
liquidation in Australia, or modify the letter to the effect that Mr
Gibbons as
Australian provisional liquidator should not pursue the present proceedings,
and/or modify the letter to the effect that
Mr Gibbons should not pursue a
Notice of Motion filed by him in the Equity Division proceedings in which Young
J made his orders
(Proceedings No  2388/99).  That Notice of Motion seeks to
restrain the present defendants from pursuing the Bermudan proceedings.
 The
Notice of Motion has been stood over generally by me on the plaintiff's
application, with liberty to apply.
<P>

23  	At issue between the parties, therefore, is the question whether
the dispute as to the efficacy of the defendants' alleged
security over the USD
account should be heard and determined by this Court.  It appears to me
important to preserve the status quo
pending the resolution of that matter or,
at least, pending the clarification of procedural means by which that matter is
to be determined.
<P>

24  	Thirdly, it appears to me from the evidence that the undertaking
and acknowledgments by the plaintiff relate to assets, the
value of which is
sufficient to cover any claim to damages and costs of these proceedings which
the defendants may have in the event
that the plaintiff fails in the
proceedings and the undertaking is called upon.  As I have mentioned, the
defendants estimate their
loss relevant to the interlocutory relief in the
present proceedings at USD280,000 per annum plus costs.  I regard this as a
maximum
amount because as I have said, the new injunctions will not prevent
reinvestment if there is no change in locality.  The evidence
indicates that
there is substantial surplus collateral in the order of USD5.5 million, in
addition to the inter-corporate loans and
shareholdings and any other
Australian corporate assets, all of which are covered by the plaintiff's
undertaking.  It seems to me
that in these circumstances, the limited
undertaking and acknowledgment by the plaintiff will provide reasonable
protection to the
defendants, subject to one other matter to which I shall
turn.
<P>

25  	The defendant say that since the plaintiff in these proceedings
is the company rather than its Bermudan or its Australian provisional
liquidator, there is no good reason for confining the plaintiff's undertaking
as to damages in any way.  This, they say, is a contractual
dispute in respect
of which the fact that the plaintiff is in provisional liquidation is
insignificant or irrelevant.  
<P>

26  	They rely on the decision of Young J in<b> </b><i>Southern
Tablelands Insurance Brokers Pty Limited (in liq) v Schomberg</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20ACLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11
ACLR 337.</a>  In that case proceedings were commenced by an insolvent company in
liquidation and its liquidator.  The plaintiffs sought an interlocutory
injunction, but their counsel was instructed to give only an undertaking by the
company as to damages limited to assets of the plaintiff
without any
undertaking being offered by the liquidator.  
<P>

27  	Young J acknowledged that there have been some cases in which
interlocutory relief has been ordered without requiring that
an undertaking be
given.  One example relied upon by the plaintiff in the present case is where
the plaintiff is impecunious and
supported by legal aid, and seeks a Mareva
order as in<b> </b><i>Allen v Jambo Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%201252" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 1252</a> and<b>
</b><i>Szentessy v Woo Ran (Australia) Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2065%20ACTR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 65 ACTR 98.</a>
Another example more closely analogous to the present circumstances is provided
by cases where interlocutory injunctions have been
granted at the suit of a
liquidator without any requirement that the liquidator give a personal
undertaking as to damages:<b> </b><i>John Arnold's Surf Shop Pty Ltd (in liq) v
Heller Factors Pty Ltd</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2022%20SASR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 22 SASR 20</a>;<b> </b><i>Clinton Credits
Pty Ltd (in liq) v John McLeay Pty Ltd &amp; Mount</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2032%20SASR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 32 SASR 389</a>
(though it is not clear from the report whether the liquidator in the<b>
</b><i>John Arnold</i> case was a party to the proceedings, and in the<b>
</b><i>Clinton Credits</i> case the liquidator was a party to the appeal but
not a party at first instance).
<P>

28  	Young J observed, nevertheless, that the circumstances in which
it is not just and reasonable that an undertaking should be
given are extremely
rare.  It follows, say the defendants, that there being nothing exceptional
about this case the usual undertaking
should be given by the plaintiff and it
should be given without qualification.
<P>

29  	The plaintiff says that this is an exceptional case because of
the international nature of the operations of the plaintiff
and the existence
in various jurisdictions of orders for provisional liquidation.  In particular,
the plaintiff draws attention to
the fact that the Australian provisional
liquidation is limited to assets in New South Wales and Victoria and that the
present proceedings
are being conducted, pursuant to directions given by this
Court on 20 July 1999, by the Australian provisional liquidator in the
company's name.  In those circumstances, says the plaintiff, it is appropriate
that the undertaking be limited to the Australian
assets. The plaintiff
distinguishes the<b> </b><i>Southern Tablelands</i> case on the basis that here
an undertaking (though limited) is offered, and so the Court is not asked to
proceed in a way which leaves
the defendants unprotected.  Indeed, as I have
indicated, the evidence shows that the assets to which the undertaking relates
appear
to be ample to cover the defendants' estimate of loss.  
<P>

30  	The plaintiff refers to the decision of Millett J in<b>
</b><i>Re DPR Futures Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%20778" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WLR 778.</a>  In that case proceedings were
brought by liquidators against the directors of a company and an application
was made for Mareva orders.
 The liquidators were not prepared to offer an
unlimited undertaking as to damages because, they said, they did not have the
authority
to commit their firm to the `theoretically open-ended liability' that
the giving of an unlimited undertaking would entail. Moreover,
they did not
have recourse to an indemnity by a substantial creditor to support their
undertaking, because there were no large creditors
but instead, several
thousand creditors from whom an adequate indemnity could not be obtained.  The
liquidators also gave evidence
of an unsuccessful attempt to secure insurance
for the undertaking.   The amount under the control of the liquidators was
approximately
3 million of which it was likely only 2 million would be
available to protect them in respect of their potential liability under
the
undertaking.  The liquidators therefore offered an undertaking limited to 2
million.  
<P>

31  	His Lordship held that in the circumstances the provision of
that undertaking was adequate.  He said (at 758) that:
<P>

`A liquidator cannot be criticised for refusing to risk his personal assets by
giving an unlimited cross-undertaking.  It is right
to require him to give an
undertaking of an amount commensurate with the size of the company's assets and
to take the risk that he
may not be authorised by the court to have recourse to
them to meet his liabilities.'
<P>

32  	In the present case the undertaking offered at the hearing on 29
July 1999 was a limited undertaking by the company rather
than by its
provisional liquidator.  After the hearing it occurred to me that the
plaintiff's undertaking as to damages may not be
sufficient to protect the
defendants in the manner evidently intended by the plaintiff's counsel in his
submissions.  My concern
was that the undertaking creates only an unsecured
obligation against the plaintiff - indeed, an unsecured obligation with limited
recourse.  It does not create any security or proprietary interest with respect
to the plaintiff's assets located in New South Wales
and Victoria. The
acknowledgment may or may not create a security interest in the surplus
collateral, and may or may not be open
to challenge as a voidable transaction
under the applicable insolvency law, but I leave those questions to one side
and proceed,
for the purposes of the present analysis, as if the only
protection offered to the defendants were the plaintiff's limited recourse
undertaking.  The plaintiff is in provisional liquidation in several countries
and there is some financial evidence that it is insolvent.
 If the plaintiff's
undertaking is no more than an unsecured obligation, the defendants would rank
as unsecured creditors of the
plaintiff if the plaintiff goes into liquidation
and they claim damages pursuant to the undertaking.  The inadequacy of that
protection
might have led me to refuse further interlocutory relief even if the
balance of the convenience were to favour the plaintiff in all
other respects,
except for a modification to the undertaking which the plaintiff subsequently
offered.
<P>

33  	Because of my concern, I met with counsel in chambers on 30 July
1999 and conveyed the problem to them.  At a further hearing
on 3 August 1999
the plaintiff modified the undertaking previously proposed, by offering as well
an undertaking in similar though
different terms by Mr Gibbons as provisional
liquidator.  The plaintiff submits that such an undertaking may be given by the
provisional
liquidator without any steps being taken to join him as a party to
the proceedings.  I agree with this submission, having regard
to the
observations by Young J in the<b> </b><i>Southern Tablelands</i> case at 341
and older English authorities including<b> </b><i>Rosling &amp; Flynn Ltd v
Guarantee &amp; Trust Company</i> (1903) 47 Sol J 255 and<b> </b><i>Westminster
Association Ltd v Upward</i> (1880) 24 Sol J 690;  see also ICF Spry,
<i>Equitable Remedies</i> (5th ed, 1997) pp 485-486.
<P>

34  	In the present circumstances the giving of the undertaking by
the provisional liquidator rather than merely by the plaintiff
company is of
significance.  Since the giving of the undertaking is a proper step for the
provisional liquidator to take in proceedings
designed to get in and protect
the assets of the company in provisional liquidation, any payment which he may
be required to make
should the undertaking be called upon is a cost or expense
incurred by him in the course of the provisional liquidation.   A provisional
liquidator is a `relevant authority' for the purposes of s 556 of the
Corporations Law.  That being so, an amount paid by him pursuant
to the
undertaking has the priority over other unsecured debts given by  s 556(1)(a).
In addition, case law indicates that a provisional
liquidator has a right of
recoupment from those assets of the company in provisional liquidation which
are under his administration,
and this right is supported by an equitable lien
in his favour for expenses as well as remuneration:  <i>Nationwide News Ltd v
Samalot Enterprises Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 227</a>, 230-231;<b>
</b><i>Shirlaw v Taylor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/415.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 415</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%205%20ACSR%20767" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 5 ACSR 767</a>, 776.  Though it is unnecessary
for me to reach a firm view, it appears also that the creditors in whose favour
the undertaking has
been given would be entitled to enforce the lien against
those assets of the company by subrogation: <i>Re London United Breweries
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%202%20Ch%20511" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] 2 Ch 511</a>; RP Meagher, WMC Gummow and JRF Lehane, <i>Equity
Doctrines and Remedies</i> (3rd ed, 1992) par 930.  Even without a right of
subrogation, it appears to me that these principles would provide adequate and
reasonable
protection in the present circumstances.
<P>

35  	In summary, it appears to me that the balance of convenience
clearly weighs in favour of the granting of the relief sought
by the plaintiff,
upon the basis of the plaintiff's undertaking and acknowledgment supported by
an undertaking in similar terms by
the Australian provisional liquidator.
Therefore, I decided yesterday to make the orders sought.  
<P>

36  	I should add that the form of the orders sought by the plaintiff
was varied between the hearings on 29 July and 3 August 1999
but the thrust of
the orders is, for relevant purposes, the same.  The defendants did not consent
to the orders, but they made no
submissions at the hearing on 3 August 1999
with respect to the terms of the orders.
<P>

37  	On 3 August 1999 the plaintiff also sought leave to file in
Court and have determined instanter a further application under
s 479(3) of the
Corporations Law for directions to the effect that Mr Gibbons, as provisional
liquidator, would be justified in providing
an undertaking as to damages in the
manner in which he, in fact, offered it.  Mr Gibbons' undertaking is limited to
the amount ultimately
available to him (net of his appropriate costs, charges,
expenses and remuneration entitlements) as provisional liquidator of the
plaintiff out of the assets of the plaintiff pursuant to his rights as
provisional liquidator (including such rights as may exist
in relation to funds
in the USD account).
<P>

38  	I considered the principles which apply to an application for
such directions in my reasons for judgment handed down on 21
July 1999.  I
thought it appropriate then to give directions to Mr Gibbons to the effect that
he would be justified in causing the
plaintiff to give a limited undertaking as
to damages and in causing the plaintiff to give the acknowledgment which I have
described.
 Implied in that conclusion was the proposition that the present
proceedings are appropriate proceedings for the provisional liquidator
to
conduct in this jurisdiction (see par 26 of my reasons for judgment).  It
appears to me to follow, especially having regard to
the additional matters
which were put to me at the hearings on 29 July and 3 August 1999, that the
application for a further direction
made on 3 August 1999 should succeed.  At
yesterday's hearing, I therefore gave a direction in the terms sought.
<P>

39  	I also ordered yesterday that the costs of the application for
further interlocutory relief until further order and the Notice
of Motion for
directions heard yesterday be costs of the proceedings.
<P>
