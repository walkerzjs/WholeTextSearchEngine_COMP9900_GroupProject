<center><b>REGINA v. NGOC Dang</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner Ngoc Dang pleaded guilty before Barr,
J. on 10 September 1999 to the offences set out in two counts
in the indictment
that had been presented against him that day.  Those offences were:  one count
of murder of Van Hong Ly;  and one
count of maliciously wounding Tu Phu Le at
Cabramatta, both on 25 April 1998.  His Honour convicted the prisoner of each
offence.
<P>

2  	The matter came before me today for the imposition of sentence.
On the sentencing proceedings the Crown tendered, and read aloud,
short facts
on sentence, which, I was informed were facts with which the prisoner agreed,
as summarising the content of the various
statements provided to the Crown on
the circumstances in which the offences had come to be committed.
<P>

3  	The deceased, Van Hong Ly, had been at the Mekong Club,
Cabramatta on the evening of Friday, 24 April.  He had worn a red baseball
cap
which from time to time he was asked by security staff of the Club to remove.
At one stage of the evening he was seated at a
table in the Club with the
prisoner and another person.  About 11.00 pm he was seen to hit the prisoner,
who fell backwards and hit
the back of his head on a table.  The deceased
picked the prisoner up by his hair, helping him into a chair and gave him a
drink.
<P>

4  	About 1.00 am on the morning of Saturday 25 April 1998, the
deceased left the Club with Tu Phu Le.  There had been some discussion
of an
acrimonious kind between them, Tu Phu Le telling the deceased that he should
not have fought with the prisoner because the
prisoner was older than the
deceased.  This discussion had continued to the point where outside the Club on
the footpath, the deceased
and Tu Phu Le were pushing at each other.
<P>

5  	After a few moments the prisoner, having left the Club, rushed up
to the deceased and Tu Phu Le holding a pistol which he deliberately
fired at
the deceased, killing him.  One eye witness said that the prisoner said at the
time of his killing the deceased said, "Fuck
your mum.  You want to play with
me?".
<P>

6  	A number of shots were fired, apparently four shots. Three of
those shots seem to have hit the deceased.  One shot hit Tu Phu
Le causing a
gutter injury to his head.  The prisoner left the scene with the gun.
<P>

7  	Tu Phu Le was admitted to hospital and, in the confusion, those
who took him to the hospital were apparently arrested by the
police.
<P>

8  	The cause of death for the deceased was given as a gunshot wound
to the head.  The examiner observed three  separate gunshot
wounds, two to the
head and one to the neck.
<P>

9  	The prisoner apparently went to Melbourne.  His sister said that
he had come to her house in July 1998, stayed briefly and left
his car in her
garage.
<P>

10  	A first instance warrant was issued for his arrest and upon him
being notified of the police interest in him, he attended the
Cabramatta Police
Station on 4 November 1998 in company with his solicitor and surrendered
himself.  He has been in custody, bail
refused, since that day.
<P>

11  	The murder weapon has not been found.
<P>

12  	Since he has been in custody referable only to these offences,
the sentence that I will pass should date from that day.
<P>

13  	It is apparent that the offence of murder was committed by his
deliberate killing of his victim.  The offence of malicious
wounding was
occasioned by his recklessness in firing a shot not intended to injure the
victim.
<P>

14  	It was common ground, so I was informed by both the learned
Crown Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the defence, that
at the time of
the commission of these crimes the prisoner was intoxicated to an extent
expressed by an eye witness to be "middle
drunk".  I take that description to
be moderately, if not severely affected.
<P>

15  	The objective facts of this crime show that the prisoner, albeit
he might have been provoked to some extent by the actions
of the deceased
inside the Club and his anger aroused, as was submitted to me, by the actions
of the deceased to Mr. Le, nonetheless
had almost no cause of any reasonable
kind to act in the way that he did.  What he did was savage and apparently
senseless.
<P>

16  	There is, so I am told, nothing in his prior background and
record which would suggest that such actions were in character.
 He was born on
24 October 1957 in Saigon and is now aged 42.  He was one of a large number of
children in his family which was poor,
and from which the children went to work
at an early age.  After the fall of Saigon, having worked on a collective farm
for a time,
he escaped Vietnam and transited through a refugee camp in Malaya,
coming to Australia as a refugee.  He has become a citizen of
this country and
has been joined here by his family, in particular by his brother with whom he
lived for some time prior to his marriage.
<P>

17  	Having obtained initially other employment, he obtained
employment with Streets Icecream being retrenched from that employment
in
September 1997 and living off the lump sum retrenchment moneys paid to him.  He
had married in 1993 and has two children;  one
born in 1994;  one in 1996.
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=18%20For%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">18  	For 13</a> years prior to his marriage he had lived with brothers
and sisters at Bossley Park.  Subsequent to his retrenchment he has been
unemployed
and he has spent most of his time at the Mekong Club drinking and
gambling.  It was urged upon me that I should accept that he had
an alcohol
problem.
<P>

19  	He had been, on the night in question, at the Club drinking for
a lengthy period of time, that period being interrupted only
by a short journey
to his home for a meal.  He had known the deceased, to what extent I am not
informed, prior to the killing.
<P>

20  	I am told that he has informed members of his family that he
regrets his conduct and the shame that he has brought on his family;
 that he
has severed all contact with his wife and children because of the shame that he
feels;  that in custody he has taken the
view that he is at risk from
associates of the deceased who are in custody and hence has, at least for the
time being, caused himself
to be placed in protective custody.
<P>

21  	It was conceded that it was anger and intoxication that underlay
his criminality that night.
<P>

22  	An explanation has been given to me as to where the gun came
from.  I have been told that he had purchased the firearm two
months before the
killing for protection for himself and his family, the family having been
threatened, and that there were drug
dealers in the vicinity.  He had found it
necessary in his view, for his protection from whoever might be threatening
him, to carry
that gun, loaded apparently, with him at all times, including in
the Mekong Club.
<P>

23  	This explanation does not sit well with the suggestion that he
is not a person of violent character.  Persons not of a violent
character
usually resort to the authorities when threatened, rather than arming
themselves with loaded firearms even on social occasions.
<P>

24  	It is accepted that the plea and the surrender have great
pragmatic value in avoiding an exacerbation of grief to the family
of the
deceased and cost to the community.  It is clear that there is, accepted in the
plea, in the circumstances of his surrender
and the expressions that he made, a
degree of contrition, particularly in the sense of sorrow for his crime and a
clear intent to
conform to what community standards might expect of a person in
his circumstances.  Albeit that he did not surrender himself for
some six
months after the shooting, it has nonetheless been conceded by the Crown that
his actions in so pleading and in so surrendering
should be treated as though
he were to be afforded the maximum value for a plea of guilty when applying the
principles expressed
in s.439 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> (1900).
<P>

25  	I accept the submission made that the plea and the circumstances
of the surrender should receive that value, particularly for
the pragmatic
value to be attached to such conduct.  That value, when taken in conjunction
with the prisoner's otherwise blameless
life in Australia and diligent work
record, affords a circumstance of the greatest assistance to the prisoner but,
nonetheless, it
cannot be given such weight as to produce a sentence unduly
disproportionate to the gravity of the crimes he has committed.
<P>

26  	The culpability attached to a killing, albeit in hot blood and
under some degree of intoxication, even if occasioned by reason
of some element
of provocation, is great.  I cannot accept, however, that the plea is to be
taken to be worth as much as it was suggested
it might be when in submissions
it was put to me that up to 30% should be allowed for it.  Indeed, in my view
in this case in  particular,
it is not necessary to quantify the plea and
thereby assess its value discretely from the other circumstances of the
case.
<P>

27  	It was submitted to me that bearing in mind that the plea was
offered at the first opportunity and that the malicious wounding
was reckless,
that crime added little to the totality of elements such that needed separate
and particular evaluation on sentence,
having been committed almost, as it
were, incidentally to the prisoner's actions which resulted in the death of the
deceased.  So
much might be accepted as far as the factual content of the
submission goes, but it is necessary that regard be had to it as a separate
offence, albeit in the circumstances it is entirely appropriate that I use my
discretion to impose sentences which are to be concurrent.
 Further, since the
minimum term of the total sentence I am minded to impose for the more serious
crime will exceed the maximum for
the crime of malicious wounding (which is
seven years), I intend to impose a sentence for that crime by way of a fixed
term.
<P>

28  	Turning to the more serious offence.  The maximum penalty
prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A</a> for the crime of murder in this state is life imprisonment.
That sentence of life imprisonment, however, is reserved by s.431B for
offences
of extreme gravity as defined by that section.  Otherwise the penalty is at
large.  Other offences in this State are punishable
by up to a maximum of 25
years.  In the case of murder and certain offences under the<b> </b>Drugs
(Misuse and Trafficking) Act (1985), however, that maximum does not apply.
<P>

29  	Having said that, it is to be accepted that I should be guided
in the imposition of sentence not only by the particular facts
and the
objective culpability of the crime, but also the mitigatory matters arising
from the personal circumstances of the prisoner
and that range of sentences
approved on appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal and passed by sentencing
judges for this crime generally.
<P>

30  	It was submitted to me by the prisoner's counsel that an
appropriate range of sentence would have as its mean in the circumstances,
a
total sentence in the order of 15 years but that a minimum term, applying s.5
of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> should be imposed in consequence of the
finding of special circumstances under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5(2)</a> so that the additional term would
be longer than one-third of the minimum term.
<P>

31  	My attention was drawn to the principles enunciated by the High
Court of Australia in<b> Bugmy v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 525.</a>  In that
decision the Court pointed out that the principles of sentencing, involving as
they generally do the protection of society,
general and specific deterrence,
rehabilitation and retribution, weigh in the minimum term as they do in the
overall sentence, but
have a different significance when the separate
components of the sentence are evaluated and particularly for ascertaining that
period
which a prisoner must serve before being permitted liberty.
<P>

32  	So the prospects of rehabilitation, though not the only matter
to consider, may weigh more heavily when defining the minimum
term than they
would when defining the total sentence.  Nonetheless, when one comes to
deciding whether there are special circumstances
and given circumstances that
might amount to special circumstances, whether an additional  term should be
longer than <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5(2)</a> set, it is necessary to bear in mind that all the principles
on which sentencing is based must receive due regard in the light of
what was
said in<b> Bugmy</b> (supra) when fixing the total sentence and fixing the
minimum term.
<P>

33  	It was urged upon me that the prisoner, being under protection
at present, might well serve a sentence more onerous than might
otherwise be
the case.  There is little reason to believe that this is not a matter that can
be left safely in the hands of the prison
authorities.  There is no reason on
what has been put to me, to expect that that condition might have to continue
for any extensive
period of time.
<P>

34  	It was further urged that the prisoner had an alcohol problem.
The Crown submitted there was nothing special about that in
the context at
least of this crime, and I accept the Crown submission.
<P>

35  	It was put to me that the prisoner is a man of 42, with a prior
blameless record, was going into custody for the first time,
coming into that
custody from a different cultural background to most prisoners, he being a
refugee, estranged from his immediate
family, albeit supported by his siblings.
It was put that the sentence would inevitably be lengthy and that all of these
considerations
would bespeak the necessity for special assistance for a longer
period of time at the conclusion of that sentence.  Particularly
my attention
was drawn to the difficulty a person of his age would have in readjusting to
society generally and obtaining employment,
in particular, at the time of
leaving gaol.
<P>

36  	On behalf of the Crown however it was submitted that there was
nothing special, in the sense of out of the ordinary, about
this.  I accept
that those circumstances can be or could be, in an appropriate case, regarded
as out of the ordinary, but that is
not just what special circumstances under
the section means.  They mean such circumstances, out of the ordinary, as would
produce
a longer than usual period of by way of additional term for supervision
and to serve the other purposes of an additional term, such
as to provide an
increased period of sanction during which the prisoner might be returned to
custody, should the prisoner manifest
any further anti-social behaviour.
<P>

37  	The maximum period of supervision provided for by the Sentencing
(General Regulation) (1996) upon the making of a parole order
is three years,
although the Board can extend that in an appropriate case for a further three
years.
<P>

38  	A paradox, of course, arises.  If, as here, one is of the view
that the prospects of rehabilitation seem to be high and that
one is unable to
say that there is, on the face of it, a real risk of further offences,
particularly of the kind committed, then
there seems little basis for requiring
an additional term longer than the statute requires.  Particularly is that the
case when the
sentence that one must pass, having regard to the gravity of the
crime, is one where the additional term would be unlikely to exceed
in length
the maximum period for supervision on a normal, proportionate basis.
<P>

39  	I am of the view that in the circumstances special circumstances
as defined by the Act do not exist here.
<P>

40  	Having heard submissions from both the Crown and the defence as
to the appropriate range of sentence in the context of the
prisoner's personal
circumstances and as to the gravity of the crime, I have concluded that the
appropriate sentence for the crime
of murder is 16 years penal servitude, to
date, as I have said, from 4 November 1998.  That sentence to comprise a
minimum term of
12 years to date from 4 November 1998 and to expire on 3
November 2010 and an additional term of four years to commence on 4 November
2010 and to expire on 3 November 2014.  There will be, on the charge of
malicious wounding, a concurrent sentence of a fixed term
of three years, that
will commence on 4 November 1998.
<P>

41  	Madam interpreter have you explained what I have just said to
the prisoner?
<P>

42  	INTERPRETER:  Yes I have interpreted everything your Honour.
<P>

43  	HIS HONOUR:  In that case would you rise please Mr. Ngoc.
<P>

44  	I sentence you for the crime of murder to 16 years penal
servitude, to comprise a minimum term of 12 years and an additional
term of 4
years, to commence and expire on the dates that I have referred to.  You are
also sentenced to a fixed term of three years
imprisonment for the offence of
malicious wounding.  That sentence is to be wholly concurrent with the sentence
I have passed for
the murder.
