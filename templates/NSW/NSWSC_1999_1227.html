<b>20875/96 - WALTER VIGNOLI v SYDNEY HARBOUR CASINO PTY LIMITED &amp; JOHN
GRIMSHAW</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT - COSTS</b>
<P>

1   	On 14 August 1996 the plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim
in which he brought an action against the first and second defendants
for
defamation.  After some amendment was allowed on the first day of the hearing
to accommodate a second action for defamation against
the same defendants the
trial commenced before me and a jury of four on 1 November 1999 and concluded
on 5 November 1999.   The jury
found that, in respect of the two matters
complained of, the first was published by the defendants but did not carry the
imputation
pleaded and the second was not published by the defendants.  I
entered verdicts for the defendants.
<P>

2   	In the same Statement of Claim the plaintiff brought an
action against the first defendant for false imprisonment.  The first
defendant
admitted liability in respect of this action by letter dated 25 October 1999
from its solicitors to the plaintiff's solicitors
in the following terms:
<P>

We are instructed to put you on notice that our client intends to not contest
the issue of liability in relation to the false imprisonment
component of your
client's claim.
<P>

It is our view that the proper course in such circumstances would be to have
the different causes of action dealt with separately.
<P>

Consequently, we seek your consent to have the matter of defamation dealt with
at the hearing on 1 November 1999 and the issue of
damages for false
imprisonment determined at a date to follow shortly thereafter.
<P>

3   	On 8 November 1999 when the false imprisonment matter was
listed for hearing an order was made by consent dispensing with the
jury.  Mr
McAlary QC made an application for an adjournment.  That application was based
on the unavailability of a "central witness",
Mr Craig Dunn, who was claimed to
have been in Mr Vignoli's presence during the whole of the period.  
<P>

4   	Mr Collins QC formally opposed the application but
indicated that he accepted what Mr McAlary QC had said about the effect
on his
case of Mr Dunn's absence.  He submitted that all counsel were available and
the plaintiff wanted his case to go ahead and
if any adjournment was to be
granted he wanted to ensure that the plaintiff was protected as to costs.
<P>

5   	Mr Dunn had apparently been involved in a motor vehicle
accident on the previous weekend in Kangaroo Valley and although the
details of
his condition were unknown it was clear that he was not available that day.  In
the circumstances I granted an adjournment
on the basis that the parties could
restore that matter to the list after further information was available to
assist in the assessment
of when the matter could proceed to hearing.
<P>

6   	The matter was restored to the list on Tuesday 9 November
1999 when, over the objection of the defendant, I listed it for hearing
the
following day.  On 10 November 1999 a further application for an adjournment
was made by Mr McAlary QC on the basis of a medical
report from Dr Noel Newton
of Picton dated 9 November 1999 which stated:
<P>

This 40 year old patient was involved in a MVA on 5/11/99 and has concussion
and whiplash.  X-Rays being done today. They are not
available as yet  however
I saw him this morning.
<P>

He has concussion with headache and whiplash with severe right neck spasm.
<P>

He is having physiotherapy and will be unfit to travel and give evidence this
week.
<P>

I would anticipate he would be fit next week.
<P>

7   	I refused the adjournment and expressed the view that the
proceedings were not impeded from commencing if, as it seemed to
me was the
case, Mr Dunn could be available for telephone communication to give any
instructions that needed to be obtained in respect
of matters that may not have
been anticipated in the evidence of Mr Vignoli or his witnesses. 
<P>

8   	The hearing of the assessment of damages for false
imprisonment proceeded to hearing on 10, 11 and 12 November 1999.  The first
defendant did not call any evidence.  I delivered my judgment on 22 November
1999.
<P>

9   	The costs argument was heard on 10 December 1999.  Mr B W
Collins QC, leading Mr T D F Hughes, of counsel, appeared for the
plaintiff and
Ms L McCallum of counsel appeared for the defendants.  
<P>

<b>Defamation </b>
<P>

10   	Mr Collins QC submitted that the defendants made six
applications during the trial which were unsuccessful.  He submitted
that
although a costs order would be made in the defendants' favour as they were
successful in the proceedings, such costs order
should not include these six
unsuccessful applications.
<P>

11   	Those applications were two applications on 1 November
1990 prior to the empanelling of the jury challenging the capacity
of the
matters complained of to carry the imputations pleaded;  two applications to
discharge the jury;  and two applications which
Mr McAlary QC, who was leading
counsel for the defendants at the trial, described as "verdict points".  All of
these applications
were unsuccessful.
<P>

12   	The first two applications took the better part of the
first day, 1 November 1999.  They are matters covered by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7A(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>, as amended, and could have been made prior to the first
day of the hearing pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a>.  
<P>

13   	These were not the only matters that were the subject of
argument on that day.  The plaintiff had originally pleaded only
one cause of
action with the re-publication relied upon for damages.  It took some little
time for the plaintiff to adopt the final
position of seeking leave to amend
the Statement of Claim to plead the re-publication as a separate cause of
action.  That amendment
was allowed and the capacity arguments then took place.
In these circumstances although the defendants' applications were not
successful
I am not persuaded that I should exclude them from the costs
order.
<P>

14   	I am also not persuaded that the applications to discharge
the jury and the two "verdict points" applications should be excluded
from the
costs order.
<P>

15   	The two applications to discharge were very short.  The
second of the "verdict points" raised by Mr Alary QC was, as I said
in my
judgment of 3 November 1999, more complex than the first.  I need not detail
the nature of those applications but in my view
they were appropriate
applications to make in the course of the trial and although unsuccessful I am
of the view they should not
be dissected out of the costs order.
<P>

16   	In all of the circumstances I am persuaded that the
plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs of the defamation proceedings.
<P>

<b>False Imprisonment</b>
<P>

17   	The plaintiff makes an application for indemnity costs in
respect of the action for false imprisonment.  In support of this
application
Mr Collins QC relied upon <b>Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Limited v
International Produce Merchants Pty Limited &amp; Ors</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/202.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 202</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2081%20ALR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 81 ALR 397</a> and
<b>Rouse v Shepherd</b> <b>(No 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 277.</a>
<P>

18   	In the former case Woodward J said at 401:
<P>

I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding "solicitor and client" or
"indemnity" costs, whenever it appears that an action
has been commenced or
continued in circumstances where the applicant, properly advised, should have
known that he had no chance of
success.  In such cases the action must be
presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or
because of some
wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established
law.  Such cases are, fortunately, rare.  But when they occur the
court will
need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion.
<P>

19   	In the latter case Badgery-Parker J drew the distinction
between the actions of a defendant in refining a case as it proceeds
and the
forcing of hopeless issues.  In awarding indemnity costs His Honour said at
282:
<P>

This behaviour put the plaintiff to the considerable expense of investigating
an issue which the defendants were seemingly only
pursing as a question of
tactics between themselves.
<P>

20   	In support of his application the plaintiff relied upon
the following findings in my judgment of 22 November 1999:
<P>

I have reached the conclusion that there was a lack of bona fides in the
defendant's pleading and that it was not justified in maintaining
it.  (par
134)
<P>

The question is whether these memoranda and the defendant's admission of
liability on 25 October 1999 is evidence upon which I am
able to reach the
conclusion on the balance of probabilities that the defence lacked
justification and the defendant was not acting
in a bona fide manner in filing
and maintaining such a defence.  I am of the view that it is.  (par 139)
<P>

21   	Mr Collins QC submitted that the behaviour of the
defendant had put the plaintiff to the considerable expense of investigating
an
issue for which there was not a scintilla of evidence to justify its
maintenance.  He submitted that in these circumstances an
order for indemnity
costs should be made.
<P>

22   	Mr Collins QC also submitted that the costs should include
costs for the 8th and 9th November 1999 when the matter did not
proceed because
of the unavailability of Mr Dunn who although described as a "central witness"
was not called to give evidence.
<P>

23   	Ms McCallum submitted that the costs to be awarded to the
plaintiff are governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r 33(4)(e) and r 33(5) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Rules</a></b>.   <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r 33(4)(e) provides:
<P>

(4)	Subject to subrule (5) where, by or under the rules or any order of the
Court, the plaintiff is entitled to his or her costs
of any proceedings to
which this rule applies, the amount of costs payable to him or her shall -
<P>

(e)	in respect  of proceedings commenced after 30 June 1993, but on or before 1
October 1997, where he or she recovers a sum more
than $75,000 but not more
than $150,000, be only a half of the whole amount."
<P>

24   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r 33(5) provides:
<P>

(5)	In a case to which subrule (4) applies, if it appears to the Court that the
plaintiff has sufficient reason for commencing or
continuing proceedings in the
Court, the Court may order that the amount of costs payable to the plaintiff be
some greater part or
the whole of the amount which would be payable to him or
her apart from that subrule.
<P>

25   	On 10 December 1999 after the parties agreed on the amount
of interest I entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount
of $80,250.  Ms
McCallum submitted that in the circumstances having regard to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r
33(4)(e), far from awarding indemnity costs, I should make an order that the
plaintiff only have half of the whole amount of his
costs.  
<P>

26   	Mr Collins QC submitted that this was a case in which I
would be satisfied that the plaintiff had "sufficient reason" for
commencing
and continuing the proceedings in the Supreme Court.  He submitted that this
was viewed by the plaintiff as a very serious
false imprisonment by reason of
which he suffered deep humiliation and disgrace.  It had been a very public
humiliation and slur
for which he sought appropriate vindication.
<P>

27   	I am of the view that the seriousness of this false
imprisonment and the plaintiff's pursuit to be vindicated in a superior
Court
was sufficient reason for him to commence the proceedings and continue them in
this Court.  Accordingly I am of the view that
although the plaintiff did not
achieve a judgment of more than $150,000 I intend to exercise my discretion in
his favour under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r 33(5) and allow him the whole of the amount of his
costs.
<P>

28   	That brings me to the final question as to whether I
should award indemnity costs to the plaintiff.  Ms McCallum submitted
that the
plaintiff has already recovered $10,000 in aggravated damages on the basis of
an unjustifiable defence.  She submitted that
I should take this matter into
account in exercising my discretion on this aspect of the matter.
<P>

29   	The award of aggravated damages is to compensate the
plaintiff for the heightened injury caused by the unjustifiable conduct
of the
defendant.<b>  Cassell &amp; Co Ltd  v  Broome </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] A.C. 1027</a> at 1124.
An award of indemnity costs is to compensate a party for the incursion of costs
in fighting or preparing to fight a case
brought by a party who, properly
advised, should have known had no chance of success.  <b>Fountain Selected
Meats (Sales) Pty Limited v International Produce Merchants Pty Limited &amp;
Ors </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/202.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 202</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2081%20ALR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 81 ALR 397</a> at 401.  They are distinct awards.
<P>

30   	I am satisfied that this defendant properly advised should
have known its defence was unjustifiable.  In the circumstances
I am of the
view the plaintiff should be awarded his costs on a solicitor/client or
indemnity basis from November 1996 when the defence
was filed to 25 October
1999 when liability was admitted.  I am also of the view that he should be
awarded his costs on an ordinary
basis from 25 October 1999.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

31   	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of the
defamation proceedings.
<P>

32   	The first defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the
false imprisonment proceedings on a solicitor/client or indemnity
basis from 29
November 1996 when the defence was filed until 25 October 1999 when liability
was admitted.  The first defendant is
to pay the plaintiff's costs from 25
October 1999 on an ordinary basis.  This order is to include the plaintiff's
costs thrown away
by the adjournment of the matter on 8 November 1999.
<P>

33   	Each party is to pay their own costs of the costs argument
on 10 December 1999.
