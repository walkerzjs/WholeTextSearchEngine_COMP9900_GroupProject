<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b> <b>(see T2147 - admissibility - evidence going to proof of
facts founding expert's opinion)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:   Yesterday Mr Lyall was asked this question at
2123 line 5:
<P>

<i>"Q.	In the periods in which you had personal contact with him before March
1995, how would you describe his mood in the way he went
about the business
that you had in common?"</i>
<P>

2   	Objection was taken to that question on the basis that it
was directed to inadmissible evidence, evidence inadmissible because
it is
irrelevant.
<P>

3   	The issue to which it is said to relate (T2123.20) is the
plaintiff's claim that he suffered psychiatric injury as a result
of the
publication sued upon, and to support the opinions of experts as set out in the
medical and psychological reports which for
the purpose of this application
have been marked MFI 1.
<P>

4   	It appears from the chronology that is not disputed that
upon a claim for psychiatric harm having being made, on 18 August
1998 the
defendant's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's then solicitors seeking
particulars.  On 20 August 1998 the plaintiff's
then solicitors replied
purporting to particularise that claim by the provision of medical reports.  On
2 November the defendant's
solicitors inquired of the plaintiff's firm whether
the plaintiff was still pressing the claim, and in that regard whether the
plaintiff
was relying upon it as particularised in the reports that had been
delivered in August of last year.
<P>

5   	There apparently the matter rested until 6pm last night, 15
November, when by fax there was served on the solicitors for the
defendant MFI2
which purports to be a further particularisation of the plaintiff's claim for
psychiatric harm.
<P>

6   	The experts' reports, upon consideration for the purpose of
this exercise as contained in MFI 1, in general terms can be stated
as
providing opinions expressed upon what the plaintiff related as to his then
present and past symptoms and, where relevant, on
signs observed.  None of the
material in MFI 1, insofar as opinions are expressed, strikes me as expressing
opinions based upon hypotheses
as distinct from facts related by the plaintiff
in consultation.  As was stressed by Mr Stitt there was nothing in the reports
that
points to external sources or factual information or other corroborative
material.  It is, as it was said, material constituted by
the opinions founded
upon representations by the plaintiff as to his subjective  condition.
<P>

7   	The facts in issue, first, are whether or not the plaintiff
has suffered a recognised psychiatric illness, and second whether
any such
illness was caused by the relevant publications.
<P>

8   	As to the evidence of the kind sought to be led from Mr
Lyall it is submitted that none is probative of either issue.  I here
interpose
that as far as I understand it, it is not sought by the plaintiff to use the
evidence as probative of the second fact in
issue, causation.  
<P>

9   	It is thus submitted given the nature of the source
material for the experts, that is from the plaintiff only, evidence of
the kind
sought to be led is simply irrelevant.  Further, evidence of the kind sought to
be led cannot be admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3.3</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> (the
Opinion rule), and particularly under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78(b).</a>  The Opinion rule in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> is an
exclusionary rule; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78</a> is the exception that relates to lay opinions.
<P>

10   	The formulation of the contentious question makes it
uncertain as to whether or not an opinion in fact is being sought or
evidence
of an observation given.  In the event that evidence of the kind being allowed,
that question might well have to be rephrased.
 In any event on the quite
distinct question of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78(b)</a> I am not presently of the view that, subject of
course to the relevance question, the kind of evidence to which the inquiry of
the
witness was directed does not fall within the exception.  Thus the main
question at this point is relevance.
<P>

11   	It is argued for the defendant that it cannot be relevant
on the bases asserted because the source is in the plaintiff himself.
 The
material that was forthcoming from the plaintiff in consultation with his
medical advisers, it is argued, is the relevant material
and not anything of
the kind Mr Lyall or indeed any other witness in his category or indeed
otherwise might give.
<P>

12   	For the plaintiff it was contended by reference to the
decision of Justice Beaumont in the <b><i>Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts
Limited (No 5)</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20FCR%20324" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 FCR 324</a> particularly at 326 and 327, that it
is trite law that for an expert medical opinion to be of any value the facts
upon which it is
based must be proved by admissible evidence, his Honour citing
<b><i>Ramsey v Watson </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20108%20CLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 108 CLR 642.</a>  His Honour went on to state
that that does not mean that the facts so proved must correspond with complete
precision to the position
on which the opinion is based.
<P>

13   	In the course of submissions Mr Donohoe pointed out that
the cited passage from<b> <i>Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty
Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2059%20ALJR%20844" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 59 ALJR 844</a> in Beaumont J's judgment provides no
limitation as to the source or origin of the admissible evidence that would
prove the facts
upon which expert medical opinion was based. No authority has
been cited that compels in my view the limitation sought to be imposed
by the
defendant.
<P>

14   	Reliance was also placed by the plaintiff in opposition to
the fundamental submission for the defendant on passages from Wigmore's
treatise on Evidence set out at page 327 of the <b><i>TPC</i></b> judgment:
<P>

<i>"1.  Testimony in the shape of inferences or conclusions always rests on
certain premises of fact.  That which has been called observation,
serving as
the basis of relief in matters directly cognizable by the senses - as, the
facts of an afffray, a conversation, a trespass,
and the like - is here
replaced by what may be called a consideration of the premise.  If the witness
has not considered or had in
mind these premises, his inference or opinion is
good for nothing.  2.  These premises, a consideration of which is essential to
the formation of the conclusion or opinion,, must somehow be supplied to the
jury by testimony.  The same witness may supply both
premises or conclusion.
The two are not necessarily connected.  3.  If the latter method is chosen, and
a witness is put forward
to testify to the conclusion, the premises considered
by him must be expressly stated, as the basis of his conclusion;  otherwise,
since his conclusion rests for its validity upon a consideration of the
premises, if those premises are not made to accompany the
conclusion, the
tribunal might be accepting a conclusion for which the witness had considered
premises found by the tribunal not
to be true.  4.  Hence, the premises must be
stated hypothetically in connection with the conclusion;  then, by other
testim0ony,
the material for determining the truth of the assumed premises may
be furnished to the tribunal".</i>
<P>

15   	Mr Stitt argued the inapplicability of the analysis in
<i>Wigmore</i> on the basis that here we are not concerned with hypotheses,
(the relevant extract being concerned with hypothetical questions),
but on the
actual related material provided by the plaintiff of subjective matters on
which the opinion was based.
<P>

16   	I can only state that on the limited consideration I have
been able to give to this aspect it does not strike me as a real
basis for
distinction, that is to isolate the hypothetical question component of the
extract from<b> </b><i>Wigmore</i><b>.  </b>The ultimate point is this: (a)
there is a conclusion, (b) it must be shown to have been based on stated facts
or hypothetical facts.
 It is the exposure of the basis of the opinion, of
whatever nature it is, that is essential, and (c) there is the proof of those
bases which must then be undertaken.  The third element, is the immediate
question, that is:  is the evidence relevant and admissible?
<P>

17   	If a plaintiff complains of symptom X which founds a
conclusion Y, the conclusion is only of value if X is established.  If
conclusion Y is based on fact X which had been given by the plaintiff to the
expert, why cannot it be proved by someone else?  One
reason advanced for the
defendant goes to discretionary considerations to which I will come shortly.
But given the cited passages
in<b> <i>TPC v Arnotts</i></b> from<b> <i>Paric
</i></b>and<b><i> Ramsey v Watson</i>,</b> I am not persuaded that as a matter
of principle in the formula which I have sought to construct, that a person
other than the plaintiff
cannot give evidence of fact X founding opinion Y.
<P>

18   	Thus I am satisfied that evidence of the kind sought to be
elicited is relevant.  Z can give evidence about fact X about which
the
plaintiff spoke to the expert.  It is not irrelevant by reason only of the
plaintiff having stated fact X to the expert which
fact founded conclusion Y by
that expert.  Whether in the end the evidence of Z proves the fact will of
course always remain to be
seen.
<P>

19   	The second leg of the defendant's argument was that
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 136</a>, or both, as a matter of discretion I should exclude
the evidence by reason of, shortly stated, notions of procedural fairness and
reliability founded in an asserted inability to test the evidence.  
<P>

20   	It has to be viewed in that way as McHugh J said recently
in <b><i>Papakosmas v The Queen</i></b> (12 August 1999,  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 37)</a> in
paragraph 87:
<P>

<i>"Notions of reliability and procedural fairness play no part in testing the
relevance of evidence for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>."</i>
<P>

21   	In this context much was made of what can only be
described from the perspective of the defendant as the uncertainty in that
party's camp as to whether the plaintiff is to give evidence in chief.  It was
submitted to me that the plaintiff should be required
to indicate now as to
whether he proposes to give evidence in his case.  The submission went on if he
<i>does</i> intend to give evidence, then evidence of the kind sought to be
elicited from Mr Lyall and other witnesses is irrelevant and creates
an
artificial structure.  I disagree with that submission as to irrelevance and
artificiality.  It would still be relevant.  I do
not see how it being relevant
it could be artificial.  It may, and in this regard I presently have no idea,
provide some  corroborative
material.
<P>

22   	It was then submitted if the plaintiff <i>does not</i>
give evidence in his case then the evidence is not admissible. This cannot be
so.  If it is relevant and admissible it will go in
subject however to
discretionary considerations.
<P>

23   	It was said that the view can be held that there is a
desire in the plaintiff's camp to obtain a forensic advantage of not
telling
the Court whether he proposes to give evidence, and the Court should not lend
itself to such a device, because that would
be offensive to the administration
of justice.
<P>

24   	The first observation to be made is this:  I paraphrase
the words of Karminski J in<b> <i>Briscoe v Briscoe</i></b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20P%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) P 501</a>
at 504:
<P>

25   	What is the concern here in this defamation action is the
duty of the Court and the duty of counsel respectively to decide
what evidence
is called and what order it is called. Speaking for the moment entirely for
myself I had always thought that the duty
of deciding what witnesses should be
called and in what order they should be called is solely a matter for counsel.
It is a grave
responsibility and it rests on counsel and on counsel alone, no
doubt taking into account advice given and instructions received.
 The
observations of Karminski J were adopted in<b> <i>Bond v Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20FCR%20494" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 1 FCR 494</a> at 514.
<P>

26   	Second, the approach of the plaintiff was openly dealt
with in this litigation in the submissions leading to and the judgment
upon
them delivered by me on 26 October 1999 in [1999] NSWSC:1061 (DLJT: 48) on the
structure of the trial.  So far as the Court
is concerned in regard to what it
knows about this aspect, it has been hitherto openly ventilated.
<P>

27   	Next, tactical manoeuvring to get someone in or keep
someone out of the witness box is a legitimate forensic play in the adversary
system but as such it is not my concern.  What is here of concern is the
discretion, and I will focus on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> as it seems to be the most pertinent,
whether or not to exclude it.
<P>

28   	The nub of the submission is involved, as I have
indicated, with notions of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness
as they are now more commonly described. The evidence, it is said, cannot be
tested.  It is said to be a case dependent entirely
on what the plaintiff says,
that is as recorded in the experts' reports.  The evidence of Mr Lyall can be
tested but the issue to
which I have ruled it to be relevant, it is submitted,
cannot through Mr Lyall be tested.
<P>

29   	A short if not entirely satisfactory response might be
that six minutes into Mr Lyall's evidence, the first witness in this
extraordinary case, might be a moment that could be described as a bit
previous.  However, by reason of the plaintiff being the source,
if he gives no
evidence it is submitted then the defendant will have been placed in the
position of not being entitled to a fair
opportunity to correct or contradict
any relevant material prejudicial to it, a phrase from the judgment of Gibb CJ
in<b> <i>Kioa v West</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR 550</a> at 569, (an appeal to the High
Court from the then regime of administrative decision making and judicial
review thereof in the context
of migration law).
<P>

30   	Particular reference was made in support of the
defendant's  contention to the judgment of Wilcox J in<b> <i>Australian Postal
Commission v Hayes</i></b><i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2087%20ALR%20283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 87 ALR 283</a> at 289.  The two passages
from 289 to 290 on which reliance was particularly placed are:
<P>

<i>"Counsel argued that the testing of opposing relevant material by cross
examination is an essential feature of the opportunity to
correct or contradict
that material; it is not enough that the party against whom the evidence was
led has the right to present evidence
in reply.  Moreover, although counsel
accept there exists some discretion to control cross-examination so as to
ensure relevance
and to guard against repetition and prolixity it is said that
the right to cross-examine means the right effectively to cross-examine.
 If
directions given by a court or a tribunal have the effect of so fettering
cross-examination so the witness' evidence cannot be
properly tested,
procedural fairness has been denied.</i>
<P>

<i>In a case where there is a dispute as to the existence of a physical
disability, being a disability whose existence or otherwise cannot
be
established by independent objective evidence and in relation to which the
acceptance or rejection of the claimant's account of
his or her symptoms is
likely to be critical, counsel contend that the right to cross-examine
effectively must include the right
to test the credit of the claimant.  One way
of testing the credit of such a claimant, counsel say, is to ask questions
which require
the claimant to commit himself or herself in relation to the
extent of the disability - the actions which he or she can, and cannot,
perform
- before confronting the claimant with a film depicting his or her actions.  If
it should happen, in such a case, that the
film shows the claimant performing
actions which have been said to be impossible, doubt may be cast upon the
claimant's credit, causing
the tribunal of fact to be cautious about relying on
the claimant's evidence in relation to matters incapable of objective
demonstration.
 If, in such a case, a claimant has seen the film before he or
she has become committed to an account of the disabilities, the claimant
may
tailor his or her evidence so as to accommodate the film, leaving false
evidence unexposed or uncontradicted."</i>
<P>

31   	It is to be noted that both the decision of the High Court
and the decision of Wilcox J were pre-<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> decisions.
<P>

32   	What is important in my view to note about what Wilcox J
said in<b> <i>Australian Postal Commission v Hayes</i></b> is that His Honour
was concerned with a Direction in fact given by the first respondent Mr Hayes
who was the lay presiding officer
of the relevant tribunal. His Honour was not
directly concerned with the admissibility of evidence.  His Honour was clearly
concerned
with the then traditional notions of procedural fairness.
<P>

33   	The second observation to be made relates to that part of
the passage cited on which reliance, it struck me, was being particularly
placed for the defendant, namely:
<P>

<i>"One way of testing the credit of such a claimant </i><cite>is to ask
questions which require the claimant to commit himself</cite><i>"</i> (emphasis
added).
<P>

34   	As a general proposition of course that cannot really be
argued but it must be considered in the context with which His Honour
was
dealing.  An application had been made  before the relevant tribunal by counsel
for the claimant, (the second respondent, before
His Honour), that in her
evidence in chief she be shown certain film.  The presiding officer directed
that that be so. The effect
of his direction, which clearly affected procedure,
was one to which the conclusion could well apply that it was an intervention
that cut across notions of procedural fairness by affecting the way the
cross-examination of that respondent was to be conducted.
<P>

35   	Nothing in what His Honour says approaches, let alone
warrants, my taking the step which was implicit in Mr Stitt's submission
that
the plaintiff should be required to indicate now as to whether he proposes to
give evidence in his case, with a view no doubt
to the plaintiff if he gives
evidence "<i>committing"</i> himself, once he is in the witness box, in the
sense used by Wilcox J.
<P>

36   	For me to give such a direction requiring such an
indication, in the light of the observations I made earlier, could be
characterised
as cutting across rules of procedural fairness and natural
justice to the same extent as the presiding officer in the tribunal in
<b><i>Hayes'</i></b> case.
<P>

37   	I accept the submissions for the plaintiff in respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> based upon what Hunt CJ at CL said in
<b><i>Welsh</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2090%20A%20Crim%20R%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 90 A Crim R 364</a> at 367 to the effect that it
provides a mechanism as to admissibility and proof otherwise not available
prior to that legislation's
enactment.  It must be not overlooked that in this
trial there is no jury and evidence admitted will be subject to close scrutiny,
weight, submission and judgment.
<P>

38   	The evidence is admitted because it is relevant.  Evidence
admitted because of its relevance is one thing. Evidence relevant
but urged to
be excluded on the bases of procedural fairness flowing to unfair prejudice in
the discretionary sense is another. 
Care in my opinion must be taken.
Evidence of the kind sought to be led can be characterised as prejudicial in
the sense, presumably,
that it will be adverse, in the sense that it is capable
of supporting a component of the plaintiff's case against the defendant.
 To
use notions of procedural fairness to exclude relevant evidence because to
admit it would amount to "<i>unfair prejudice"</i> or create "<i>unfair
prejudice" </i>because it cannot be "<i>tested",</i> is a very sweeping
proposition given the operation of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> since 1995 and the non-jury
structure of the present trial.
<P>

39   	I refer to two passages in the judgment of McHugh J in
<b><i>Papakosmas</i></b> in paragraphs 93 and 97.  His Honour said in the
former:
<P>

<i>"Some recent decisions suggest that the term `unfair prejudice' may have a
broader meaning than that suggested by the Australian Law
Reform Commission and
that it may cover procedural disadvantages which a party may suffer as a result
of admitting evidence under
the provisions of the Act.  In <b>Gordon v Pike</b>
Beaumont J used his discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135(a)</a> to exclude the transcript of a
bankrupt, which would otherwise have been admitted as an exception to the
hearsay rule pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63</a>, on the basis that the prejudicial effect of
being unable to cross-examine the maker of the representation on a crucial
issue in
the litigation substantially outweighed the probative value of the
evidence.  In<b> Commonwealth v McLean</b> the New South Wales Court of Appeal
used <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135(a)</a> to exclude hearsay evidence otherwise admitted by the exception
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 64</a> on the basis that the defendants were prevented by other
evidentiary ruling from effectively challenging the evidence.  It is
unnecessary
to express a concluded opinion on the correctness of these
decisions, although I am inclined to think that the learned judges have
been
too much influenced by the common law attitude to hearsay evidence, have not
given sufficient weight to the change that the
Act has brought about in making
hearsay evidence admissible to prove facts in issue, and have not given
sufficient weight to the
judicial meaning of `prejudice' in the context of
rejecting evidence for discretionary reasons."</i>
<P>

40   	In paragraph 97 his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 135</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">136</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a> contain powers which are to be applied on a case
by case basis because of considerations peculiar to the evidence in the
particular
case.  It may be proper for appellate courts to develop guidelines
for exercising the powers conferred by these sections so that
certain classes
of evidence are usually excluded or limited.  But those sections confer no
authority to emasculate provisions in
the Act to make them conform with common
law notions of relevance or admissibility."</i>
<P>

41   	In the end it may very well be that the plaintiff chooses
not to give evidence.  Such other evidence as has been given, if
any, will
simply end up being of no value.  It will not be accepted, so Mr Stitt submits.
He may well be right.  I am however at
this time not persuaded of any unfair
prejudice to the defendant by the admission of the evidence of the kind
referred to on the
issues as identified.  However, for the reasons I have
earlier stated I will reject the question asked.  I will admit the evidence
of
the kind to which these reasons refer and will permit Mr Donohoe to rephrase
his question.
<P>

<b>Addendum (see T2148.5)</b>
<P>

42   	As I mentioned earlier in my reasons, I was invited to
exercise a discretion under both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 135</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">136</a>. As I mentioned earlier
in my reasons, it seemed to me that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135</a> was the more relevant section
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  In fairness to Mr Stitt I should indicate and make
clear that I am persuaded not to exercise my discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135</a>
either in terms of subsection (a) or subsection (c), the latter being concerned
with undue waste of time.  I cannot be persuaded
of that in the light of my
findings of relevance and rejections of submissions as to artificially and the
like.
<P>

43   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 136</a> provided for a discretion to limit the use of
evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might be
unfairly
prejudicial to a party or misleading or confusing.
<P>

44   	The reason that I made no specific ruling at the time I
gave the first part of my reasons to dispose of this application was
that I
could recall, and I am fairly convinced it is the case, no submissions from
either side as to the nature of any such limitations
that would be imposed
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 136.</a> In the absence of such submissions I cannot conclude that
there is any basis for the limitation of the use of such evidence.
