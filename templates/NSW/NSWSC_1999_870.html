COMMON LAW DIVISION

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

MONDAY 30 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<u>12178/1998</u>	<u>MARTHA ANN HEEREN v RESIDENTIAL TENANCY TRIBUNAL &amp;
ANOR</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff seeks relief pursuant to s 107 of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act </u>1987</a> (the Act).  The section is headed "Appeal
against decision of Tribunal with respect to matter of law".  An appeal under
this provision
lies only where "the Tribunal decides a question with respect to
a matter of law'".  The hearing took place on 16 August 1999.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff and the second defendant are parties to a
Residential Tenancy Agreement.  The plaintiff is the landlord.  The
second
defendant is the tenant.  The premises were located in a three storey block of
units.
<P>

3  	A burglary took place on 3 December 1997.  Certain goods
(including a diamond ring) were stolen from the premises.
<P>

4  	On 12 February 1998, the second defendant filed an application in
the Residential Tenancies Tribunal (the tribunal).  He sought
compensation for
the loss of goods.  He claimed the sum of $3,280.
<P>

5  	By consent, the application was dealt with by way of informal
hearing before a member of the tribunal (Mr Moore).  The landlord
was
represented by his agent.  The applicant was represented by Southern Tenancy
Services.
<P>

6  	On 16 March 1998, a decision was made.  The landlord was ordered
to pay the sum of $2,645 to the tenant.  There was a request
for written
reasons.  The reasons were provided on 2 October 1998.
<P>

7  	The tribunal has filed a submitting appearance.  Both the
plaintiff and the second defendant have been represented by counsel
in these
proceedings.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff seeks to have the order of the tribunal set aside.
The order is challenged on two bases.  The first basis has
been described as a
matter of jurisdiction.  The second basis has been described as a matter of
causation.
<P>

9  	I shall first turn to the matter which has been described as
going to jurisdiction.  The argument is founded on the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections
16</a> and 99 of the Act.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> (1) enables the bringing of an application,
where there is a claim that a breach of a term of the agreement has occurred,
for an
order in respect of the breach.  The provision requires that the
application be made not later than 30 days after becoming aware
of the breach.
Section 99 is a provision that enables the tribunal (inter alia on its own
motion) to grant an extension of time (even
though the relevant period of time
has expired).
<P>

10  	In this case, the application was not made within the prescribed
time.  There was no application for  an extension of time.
 The fact that the
application had been brought out of time was not raised by the landlord during
the hearing before the tribunal.
 Accordingly, the hearing before it was
conducted on the basis that the application had been brought within time.  No
question of
lack of jurisdiction was raised.
<P>

11  	It has been said that this is a case where there was no
jurisdiction to entertain the application and that jurisdiction cannot
be
conferred by consent.  Although the full implications of such a submission were
not pursued in argument, it seems to me that the
submission has no application
in the circumstances of this case.
<P>

12  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> is an enabling provision which also imposes a
limitation as to time.  The Act enables the extending of the time limitation
(even
though the application for extension is made outside the relevant
limitation period).  The Act does not impose any condition precedent
which must
be satisfied before the bringing of the application in respect of the claim.
The plaintiff looks to <u>Dandashli v Dandashli</u> (Court of Appeal,
unreported, 16 December 1996), which it is said related to an analogous
provision <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 52</a> (4) of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</u> 1988</a>), as support for the
submission.  Not only do I not regard <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> (4) as an analogous provision, I
consider that <u>Dandashli</u> merely confronts the submission with further
difficulty. In my view, the tribunal did not lack jurisdiction.
<P>

13  	Limitation provisions take various forms.  The authorities
suggest that a true statute of limitation (being one which does
no more than
cut off resort to the courts for enforcement of a claim) is procedural in
nature (<u>McKain v R W Miller &amp; Co (SA) Pty Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 1</a> at
41).  A party may or may not choose to rely on the expiry of a limitation
period as a Defence to a claim.  If the party chooses
to rely on it as a
Defence it must be raised as an issue between the parties.  In a court of
pleading it must be specially pleaded.
 The matter of the expiry of the
limitation period was not raised during the hearing before the tribunal.
Generally speaking, parties
are bound by the course they have adopted at the
hearing in the lower court or tribunal.  If the point had been taken during the
hearing the defendant would have had the opportunity to both make and lead
evidence in support of an application for extension of
time.  I do not consider
that the plaintiff should now be allowed to raise it in these proceedings (see
<u>Chilcotin Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Cenelage Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA
11).</a>
<P>

14  	I now turn to the matter of causation.  Section 29 of the Act
imports a term into every Residential Tenancy Agreement.  The
term is to the
effect that the landlord shall provide and maintain such locks or other
security devices as are necessary to ensure
that the residential premises are
reasonably secure.  I should now mention the substance of certain of the
relevant findings made
by the member.  The member found that there had been a
breach of that term.  The breach was in substance a failure to fit a deadlock
to the front door to the premises (as opposed to the front door to the block of
units).  It was also found that as a consequence
of this breach a thief was
able to gain entry.  The plaintiff says that there was no evidence of causation
between that breach and
the loss of property.
<P>

15  	The member had a body of evidence before him.  I shall mention
some of it.  There was evidence that the main entry or front
door to the block
of units had been manipulated.  He had evidence that the tongue of the tumbler
lock on the front door to the premises
had been twisted by a force being
applied by a crowbar or similar object.  This evidence was provided by a
builder.  There were photographs.
 There was a statement from the landlord and
two reports regarding the door-locks at the premises.  There was a police
report.  Also,
oral evidence was given on behalf of each party.  The landlord
did not seek to adduce evidence that a device such as a dead-lock
would not
have prevented such a forceful entry.  There were deadlocks fitted to the front
doors of other units.  Following the burglary,
a deadlock was fitted to the
front door of the premises.
<P>

16  	It must also be borne in mind that the tribunal is required to
hear and determine matters without regard to technicalities
or legal forms.  It
is not bound by the rules of evidence and may inform itself on any matter in
such manner as it thinks fit.
<P>

17  	Whether or not the question of causation can be characterised as
giving rise to a decision as to a matter of law in the sense
required by the
Statute (a question which was not fully argued), I am not satisfied that any
error of law (or other basis) has been
demonstrated by the plaintiff  for the
disturbing of the decision made in respect of that question.  In my view, it
was open to the
tribunal to make the finding that the loss of the ring flowed
from the breach of the implied statutory term.
<P>

18  	I affirm the decision of the tribunal.  The Summons is
dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the Summons.
