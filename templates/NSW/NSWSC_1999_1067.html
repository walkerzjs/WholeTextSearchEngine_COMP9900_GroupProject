<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER: This is an application to set aside a statutory demand
served by the defendant on the plaintiff dated 12 May 1999. 
Demand is for
$343.607.01.  The demand makes claims in respect of three separate areas.
There are firstly trading debts of $298,607.01;
there is a loan in the sum of
$20,000; and there is said to be an advance as a rebate on sales of $25,000.
<P>

2  	     Both the companies who are parties to these proceedings are
in the printing industry, and the disputes concern matters
arising in that
context.
<P>

3  	     The plaintiff raises what are said to be genuine disputes in
respect of three areas and offsetting claims in respect of
four areas.  This
requires a consideration of what is meant by a genuine dispute and what is
necessary in respect of an offsetting
claim.
<P>

4  	     I have had the benefit of having a number of submissions in
respect of the principles to be applied and I think probably
the most useful
summation is that given by McLelland CJ in Equity in <i>Eyota Pty Limited v
Hanave Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 669.</a>  At page 671 his Honour made the
following comments respect of the expression "Genuine dispute":
<P>

     "It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression
'genuine dispute' where it occurs in s 459H. In my opinion
that expression
connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the
same sort of considerations as the 'serious
question to be tried' criterion
which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the
extension or removal of
a caveat.  This does not mean that the Court must
accept uncritically as giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an
affidavit 'however equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with
undisputed contemporary documents or other statements by the
same deponent, or
inherently improbable in itself, it may be 'not having' sufficient prima facie
plausibility to merit further investigation
as to (its) truth' (cf Eng Mee Yong
v Letchumanan  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC 331</a> at 341), or a 'patently feeble legal argument, or
an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence' (cf South Australia v Wall
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2024%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 24 SASR 189</a> at 194).
<P>

     But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a Court required to
determine whether there is a genuine  dispute should
not embark upon an enquiry
as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute.
 There is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute.  In Mibor Investments
(at ACLC  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1066%20ACSR%20366%2d7" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1066; ACSR 366-7)</a> Hayne J said, after referring to the state of the
law prior to the enactment of Division 3 of Part 5.4 of the Corporations Law,
and
to the terms of Division 3:
<P>

     'These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases,
it is not expected that the Court will embark upon
any extended inquiry in
order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and
certainly will not attempt
to weigh the merits of that dispute.  All that the
legislation requires is that the Court conclude that there is a dispute and
that
it is a genuine dispute.'
<P>

     In Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20919" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 919</a> at 922;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 601</a> at 605 Thomas J said:
<P>

     'There is little doubt that Division 3... prescribes a formula that
requires the Court to assess the position between the parties,
and preserve
demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient
genuine offsetting claim.  That is not
to say that the Court will examine the
merits or settle the dispute.  The specified limits of the Court's examination
are the ascertainment
of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there
is a "genuine claim".
<P>

     It is often possible to discern the spurious, and to identify mere bluster
or assertion.  But beyond a perception of genuineness
(or the lack of it) the
Court has no function. It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more
likely than the other to succeed,
or that the eventual state of the account
between the parties is more likely to be one result than another.
<P>

     The essential task is relatively simply to identify the genuine level of a
claim (not the likely result of it) and to identify
the genuine level of an
offsetting claim (not the likely result of it).'
<P>

     I respectfully agree with those statements."
<P>

5  	     There are a number of different affidavits that have been
filed in these proceedings BY Mr Canty on behalf of the plaintiff.
They have
variously been referred in submissions by a shorthand method, and for the
purposes of identification the affidavit Canty
1 is one sworn by Mr Canty on 12
June 1999 in which he annexes a copy of a statutory demand.  Canty 2 is a
further affidavit of Mr
Canty of 12 June 1999.  Canty 3 is an affidavit sworn
by him on 14 August 1999, and Canty 4 is one sworn on 4 September 1999.
<P>

6  	     I turn to the various genuine disputes which are said to
exist. The first concerns the loan of $20,000. In about mid September
1998
negotiations commenced between the plaintiff for two separate matters.  One was
the acquisition of shares by the defendants
in the plaintiffs.
<P>

7  	     The second was the establishment of a joint venture between
the defendant, the plaintiff and Gerard Number 3 Pty Ltd and
such other print
manufacturers as the parties thought would be appropriate, and which was
generally referred to in  the evidence
as the Consortium.  As part of that
process the defendant had to carry out some due diligence work in respect of
the plaintiff's
financial situation.  This led to discussions about the costs
that would be involved in that due diligence effort.
<P>

8  	     In para 4 of Canty 2 there is set out a conversation between
Mr Machin and Mr Canty as to the arrangements for some payments
to the
plaintiff to enable that due diligence work to proceed. The original amount
suggested was $50,000 however it was reduced to
$20,000.
<P>

9  	     On the terms of the conversation which is alleged by Mr
Canty the deposit will not be refundable.  This is understandable
given that
the work would involve external costs for accountants which the plaintiff will
have to pay. There certainly was a dispute
raised by the defendant in
correspondence about its repayment.  There seems to be quite clearly a genuine
dispute in respect of that
amount.
<P>

10  	     The next area concerns a claim for $25,000 which in the
demand was referred to as an advance to the company by the creditor
for rebates
of sales. This matter arises in two areas. First, in the claim for $25,000 in
the statutory demand and secondly, in an
offsetting claim which the plaintiff
wishes to raise.  The fees for the $25,000 in the demand are in respect of the
month of May,
and the offsetting claim is a claim by the defendant for June,
July and August for a total of $75,000.  Apparently by September 1998
the
parties were negotiating for the consortium agreement which would replace the
arrangements under which this claim was made. 
<P>

11  		The arrangement was described in the evidence as a
Representation Management Agreement.  The plaintiff apparently provided
services representing the defendant and its holding company, Gerard in sales
and print management.  The proposal seemed to be based
upon an arrangement that
the plaintiff would provide sales of some $500,000 per month to the defendant
and receive a 5 per cent rebate
on such sales.
<P>

12  	    There has been given some detailed evidence in para 7 of
Canty 4 about the nature of the particular arrangement. Those
conversations are
as follows:
<P>

"In my conversations with Mr Machin and/or other employees of the defendant
between 22 April 1998 up to and including 4 May 1998
words to the following
effect was spoken:
<P>

I said: 'We will need Custom and Gerard  (referring to Gerard Industries Pty
Ltd) to support the costs of operation of Quill in
the print management side of
things.  You will see from our costs summary that there is a significant
commitment by Quill to infrastructure.
 Quill will require that support by way
of a $25,000 a month retainer from Custom.'
<P>

Mr Machin said: 'Yes but we will need some offset for that type of money from
Quill's sale rebate of 5%.'
<P>

I said: 'OK the $25,000 print management retainer fee payable by Custom to
Quill can be deducted from the first $25,000 of 5% rebate
which Quill will
receive for sales directed to Custom.'"
<P>

13  	     Subsequently payment was apparently made for both April
and May. In May a letter from Mr Canty to Mr Machin of Custom
Press referred to
the matters in these terms:
<P>

"Custom will advance the rebate in item 4 in the form of a retainer, at $25,000
per calendar month, effective 4 May 1998, as a contribution
to its cash flow
and cost of operation."
<P>

14  	          Invoices were issued by the plaintiff referring to the
item as a retainer. There was then after the May invoice a
discussion between
Mr Canty and Mr Machin in which Mr Canty was asked to amend that invoice to
show it as a pre-payment for sales
rebates which he did.  The conversation set
out in para 7 indicates the nature contended for by Mr Canty.
<P>

15  	     Clearly there is a dispute on the evidence between the
parties about the nature of this amount. The discussions which
I have quoted
and the letter to which I have referred does not deal with the event that has
happened in this case, namely, that $500,000
per month of business was not
directed to the defendant.  It is also notable that the claim in respect of the
75,000 surfaces in
correspondence between the parties after May. Mr Machin
himself, although not believing the dispute to be genuine acknowledged that
there was this dispute between the parties.  It is not for me to construe the
terms of the conversation or the agreement, but it
does seem to me that there
might be a basis for the payments to be made as a rebate on sales.
Accordingly, I would think there was
genuine dispute in respect of the $25,000
and an appropriate offsetting claim in respect of the $75,000.
<P>

16  		The next area of genuine dispute concerns trade debts.  In one
matter, namely a job for the Isle de Pines there emerged a
dispute early in the
parties relationship before the issue of the statutory demand.
<P>

17  	     The other disputes in respect of the trade debts raised in
the claim were raised in Canty No 3.  In para 7 of that affidavit
Mr Canty
identifies five separate areas where there is a dispute in respect of a large
series of invoices.  The particular areas
are, art work, authors corrections,
freight, film supplied, etc.  Taking account of all these disputes there are
said to be disputed
items of $33,588.33.
<P>

18  	     The defendant contested whether the disputes were genuine
and in particular relied upon the fact that the dispute was
not particularised
until after the demand was served.  In particular, correspondence between the
parties prior to the demand dealing
with the disputes which had arisen between
the parties, did not deal with any of these claims.
<P>

19  	     It is perfectly obvious to me that the disputes are raised
late in the peace but given the description of the nature of
the problems in
the affidavit I am satisfied that the disputes are genuine.
<P>

20  	     I turn to the various offsetting claims. There is an
offsetting claim for $8,450 for film supplied by the plaintiff to
the defendant
and not returned.  There is also a claim for $6,100 for damages in respect of
the Isle de Pines job which involved
extra travel on the part of the
plaintiff's officers in order to rectify the problem.  I am satisfied that both
of these are genuine
offsetting claims.
<P>

21  	      I have already referred to the $75,000 offsetting claim
which I will allow. The next one is a claim for $61,804. This
relates to monies
that were to be invested by the defendant between May and September under the
Representation Agreement.
<P>

22  	     There is no doubt that it had an obligation under that
agreement.  There was however no evidence proffered by the plaintiff
which
quantified the cost of what it may have done in place of the defendant's
obligation. Accordingly I am not satisfied that there
is any damage
suffered.
<P>

23  	     The last area of offsetting claims concerns the consortium
agreement.  Basically it was an idea for a syndicate of printers
to bid for
jobs in order to give them sufficient force or clout in the market place.  The
idea seems to have started in September
1998, and a number of tenders were put
out to parties such as Boral, AMP and SOCOG.
<P>

24  	     Apart from the parties to the proceedings the other
consortium members were to be Buscombe Vic Print, Southport Printing
Co and the
Bruckman Group.
<P>

25  	     The arrangements for the consortium were to include
payments to the plaintiff of $10,000 per month from each consortium
member for
representation and marketing services. It was this which underpinned the large
alleged offsetting claims for damages for
breach of the consortium
agreement.
<P>

26  	     Part way through the discussions to put it in place it
became clear that any hope of winning a SOCOG contract depended
upon there
being someone of substance leading the consortium.  Accordingly the defendant's
holding company, Gerard Industries was
to take this role.  This appears to have
occurred from about February 1999 onwards.
<P>

27  	     Part of the general arrangements included the loan from
Gerard to Quill of some $235,000 which would be repaid over time
from the fees
earned.
<P>

28  	     The draft of the agreement between the parties to the
proceedings and Gerard was prepared in November 1998.  That agreement
particularly anticipated the other consortium members joining in the agreement
as members. That this was necessary it appears from
some evidence given by Mr
Canty (pps 7 and 8 of the transcript) when he had a discussion with Mr Machin
about the terms of the draft
agreement. Mr Machin it is said to have said that
he was content with the agreement, that they were going to proceed. He went on
to say he had instructed that the agreement to be issued to his lawyers and the
other consortium members for formalisation.
<P>

29  	     There is no evidence that the other consortium members had
agreed to the arrangements and the fact of the matter is that
they ultimately
did not.  As a result the whole arrangement fell to the ground.
<P>

30  	     By 21 March 1999 one has a document which was a memorandum
of understanding, annexure JM 4 to the affidavit of Mr Machin.
It is signed by
Mr Canty and dated 21 March 1999.  Importantly in the recitals, recital C
indicates that agreement was still needed
to the consortium agreement, and in
recital D that is provided that if the consortium agreement can be agreed then
there will be
an appropriate basis for Quill to repay the substantial loan
which was to be paid.
<P>

31  	      Reference is made in recital E to the fact that Gerard
assumed primary responsibility for the SOCOG arrangements which
were proceeding
at that stage with some temporary jobs. The memorandum also made provision for
Gerard before the loan was put in
place to be satisfied as to the solvency of
Quill and under 1.4 it was obviously clear that the payments of $10,000 from
each of
the consortium members were a necessary part of the arrangement.
<P>

32  	     Cl 5 provided that the parties agreed that the memorandum
of understanding was to be of no legal effect unless and until
the consortium
agreement had been signed by all the consortium members.  That may be so and
clearly it has not come into effect,
but that clause does not mean that the
clear understanding of Mr Canty at that stage was as was set out in the
recitals to which
I have referred.
<P>

33  	     On 15 April 1999 there was a meeting between the parties
and the various representatives of the other companies who were
to be members
of the consortium.  The outcome of that is recorded in a letter of 29 April
1999. Two things become immediately apparent.
 The first was that the plaintiff
was not able to satisfy the defendant or Gerard of its solvency, and more
importantly the plaintiff
was not able to persuade any of the other members of
the consortium to agree to provision for payment to the plaintiff of $10,000
per month for its services.  As a result the negotiations for the consortium
agreement were called off in that letter of 29 April.
Clearly there never was
an agreement for a consortium therefore the claim for damages has no basis.
<P>

34  	     In any event the proposed consortium was certainly also not
successful in respect of obtaining business from SOCOG. Although
while the
arrangements were being negotiated with SOCOG it did some printing jobs for
them Exhibit 2 makes it perfectly plain that
all future business was going to
the final approved printing sponsor for the games - not the consortium.
<P>

35  	     Therefore I am satisfied there is no offsetting claim
arising out of the consortium agreement.  In the result I find that
there are
genuine disputes in the sum of $20,000, $25,000, $33,588.33. I also find that
there are offsetting claims of $75,000, $14,550.
 These items total
$168,138.33. This leaves an admitted amount of $175,468.68.
<P>

36  	     Accordingly, I order that the demand served on the
plaintiff by the defendant dated 1 May 1999 be varied by reducing the
amount to
$175,468.68.  So far as costs are concerned there has been only partial success
by the plaintiff.  My view is that the
appropriate order is that each party pay
its own costs.
