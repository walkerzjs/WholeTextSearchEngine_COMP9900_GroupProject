FRIDAY 1 OCTOBER 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>(On application to discharge the jury)</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: In this matter I have delivered a number of judgments
referring to the unfortunately fractured nature of these proceedings.
 A
witness whose statement had been served prior to committal, who was not called
at committal and in respect of whom appropriate
steps were not taken to secure
the witness' presence or testimony prior, has been brought to Australia.  The
Crown had made application
prior to trial to take the witness' evidence by
video link.  I ruled against that application because of the crucial nature of
the
witness' evidence and because a real question arose as to whether the
witness would be under any such sanction as was the equivalent
of the New South
Wales oath, having regard to the requirements of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> and of the
relevant part of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.
<P>

2  	Subsequently, on the witness' arrival, a further statement has
been obtained indicating that the witness can give evidence which
certainly
focuses most powerfully on matters which, while they may have fallen within the
general ambit of what the witness earlier
had been thought to be able to say,
now are put specifically in a way which most powerfully impacts upon the
case.
<P>

3  	The case remains a circumstantial case.  However, the testimony
that the witness apparently can give is such as immeasurably
to strengthen the
Crown case.  The defence, confronted with this information, has sought an
opportunity to make enquiries to see
if avenues might exist for evidence that
might rebut such portions of the new material as are capable of being put to
the test of
independent testimony. The Crown has argued that no adjournment
should be granted, although the Crown Prosecutor recognised that
at least some
opportunity for inquiries might be appropriate, and that a pre-trial
examination of the witness commonly referred to
as a <b>Basha</b> enquiry
should commence immediately.
<P>

4  	The Crown had long conceded that if the witness were to give
evidence in person such an inquiry would have to be undertaken.
<P>

5  	It is clear that there are substantial avenues for
cross-examination of the witness.  The witness gives evidence under an
immunity,
apparently protecting the witness from prosecution for crimes in
connection with the three murders with which the accused stands
charged.
<P>

6  	The witness gives evidence, having come here, by way of an
arrangement under a mutual assistance agreement, having the benefit
of certain
statutory immunities provided for in the Federal legislation and by agreement
with the Republic of Korea.
<P>

7  	In the Crown case there are at least the bases for allegations
that might be put to the witness of an involvement in forging
and uttering,
obtaining property by deception and possibly accessory after the fact to or
accessory to three murders.
<P>

8  	There has been immense difficulty in the Crown securing the
attendance of the witness in Australia.  In that respect documentation
has been
produced on subpoena both from the Federal Attorney General Department and the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
 With that in mind the Crown has
sought that the enquiry examining the witness' evidence should proceed and,
consistently until now,
throughout the trial has sought and obtained
adjournments on the basis that the trial could still proceed in front of the
jury that
is empanelled notwithstanding the spasmodic nature of the proceedings
before them.  My own observations of the jury have been such
as to indicate to
me that they retain a vivid interest in the proceedings and a willingness to
continue to serve notwithstanding
that the case has grown highly confusing so
far as individual items of evidence can be said to relate to the case as a
whole and
to others.  Partly this is a consequence of the Crown Prosecutor
having had to open the case in the general and restricted way that
he did in
consequence of his not being aware of whether or not this particular witness
would come to Australia.  Now, however, the
Crown has taken the view that it
supports the application for discharge which has been made during the trial
again and again by the
defence.
<P>

9  	There remains, however, a problem.  It is submitted by the
defence that in the event that I discharge the jury it is possible
that some
restriction may exist in law on whether or not the evidence of the witness
might be taken on some appropriate application
and in particular it is
submitted that the <b>Basha</b> enquiry procedure does not exist for this
purpose.  Nonetheless, recognising this, it is the Crown submission in support
of what
has been put by the defence that the jury should be discharged and that
there is no good reason including any problem that might
be associated with a
<b>Basha</b> enquiry for maintaining the jury.
<P>

10  	It would not be appropriate, in my view, notwithstanding that
the jury has been excused for the day, by reason of the prospect
of the
<b>Basha</b> enquiry and the various arguments that have gone on, for me to
maintain this jury solely for the purpose of hearing an argument about
whether
or not things that would be done after their discharge may or may not have
particular legal foundation.
<P>

11  	With those considerations in mind I discharge the jury.
