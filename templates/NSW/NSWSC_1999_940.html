Friday 27 August 1999 - ex tempore<br>Revised 24 September
1999<br><br><b>050113/98 - IDOPORT PTY LTD &amp; MARKET HOLDINGS PTY LTD v
NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD &amp;
ORS</b><br><br><b>JUDGMENT</b><br><br><br>1   	HIS HONOUR:  In
proceedings No 50113 of 1998 a reserved judgment was delivered on 19 August 1999
after the interlocutory hearing.
 In paragraph 353 of that judgment, I indicated
that, &#8220;in relation to the sections of the notice of motion as seek an
order
that the Bank and NMG keep separate accounts and records, to my mind the
balance of convenience is heavily in favour of the making
of such an order,
provided that an order can be framed with sufficient specificity to permit of
its enforcement&#8221;.<br><br>2   	Leave was reserved to the
parties to address submissions inter alia on the keeping of separate accounts
and records, on costs
and for the bringing in of short minutes of
order.<br><br><b>The Keeping of an Account</b><br><br>3   	There
has been argued the question of whether and, if so, in what form, an order for
the keeping of separate accounts should
be made, and also the question of the
appropriate order dealing with costs of the interlocutory
hearing.<br><br>4   	The plaintiffs have sought to propound as
the appropriate form of order dealing with the keeping of accounts, an order in
terms
of the definitions set out in the paragraph numbered 1 in short minutes of
orders and directions dated 27 August 1999.<br><br>5   	In
argument, the plaintiffs made plain that they sought to have the definition of
"AUSMAQ Service" which appears at the commencement
of the proposed order
expanded by the addition at the end of that definition of the words "and
AUSMAQ(NZ) Limited".<br><br>6   	The amended notice of motion
first before the Court during the interlocutory hearing was that filed on 4 June
1999.  During the
course of the interlocutory hearing, leave to further amend
that notice of motion was granted on 3 August 1999 - see paragraph 31
of the
judgment.<br><br>7   	I grant leave to the plaintiffs to further
amend the notice of motion to claim relief in terms of the definitions to which
I
have referred, and paragraph 1 of the short minutes of order and directions
dated 27 August 1999 which I initial and date 27 August
1999 and place with the
papers.<br><br>8   	I direct that the plaintiffs file and serve
to regularise the record, an amended notice of motion which is to comprehend the
amendments in respect of which leave to amend was granted on 3 August 1999 and
the further leave to amend now granted.<br><br>9   	I turn first
to the question of the plaintiff's application to have an order with respect to
the keeping of accounts now made.
 For obvious reasons, it is inappropriate to
repeat matters dealt with in the reserved judgment delivered on 19 August 1999
in terms
of the plaintiff's pleadings, in terms of the principal issues, in
terms of the adjudication of the court on serious questions to
be tried, and in
terms of the balance of convenience issues.  The defendants oppose the making of
any order for the taking of accounts,
submitting that there is no jurisdictional
basis for the making of such an order, and submitting that there is no general
discretionary
jurisdiction to order a defendant to keep accounts pending a final
hearing. The submission is that an order to keep accounts is in
the nature of a
mandatory injunction and that, at the very least, a plaintiff at interlocutory
level must establish that there is
a serious question to be tried as to an
entitlement on a final hearing to an order for an account of
profits.<br><br>10   	The defendants&#8217; submission is that in
essence an entitlement to an order for an account depends on establishing that
the
defendant has knowingly derived profit from misappropriating proprietary
rights that belong to the plaintiff. The submission is that
the finding at
judgment paragraph 327 makes it clear that in essence Idoport's case at
interlocutory level is for unliquidated damages
for breach of contract. The
defendants&#8217; submission is that such a claim is quite unrelated to the
equitable remedy of an account.
The defendants&#8217; submission is that the
keeping of an account is not an equitable remedy ancillary to a claim for
unliquidated
damages for breach of contract for fiduciary duty. Finally, the
defendants submit that the process of discovery in the current proceedings
represents the extent, and the full extent of Idoport's pretrial entitlement to
access to information.<br><br>11   	There are a number of
passages to be found in Spry <i>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</i> (1990)
The Law Book Company Ltd 4th edition, and in Meagher Gummow and Lehane <i>Equity
Doctrines and Remedies </i>Butterworths, 3rd edition 1984, and in Parkinson
<i>The Principles of Equity</i> Law Information Services 1996 and in the
authorities which, to my mind, make plain that the Court has jurisdiction at
this time in
these proceedings to order the keeping of accounts as an
alternative to the more severe forms of interlocutory injunctive relief
which
the plaintiffs had sought and which, for reasons set out in the reserved
judgment, the Court determined in the exercise of
its discretion, not to
grant.<br><br>12   	The following passage appears in Spry (at
page 449):<br><br><i>"When it is deciding in its discretion whether or not an
interlocutory injunction should issue, the court takes account, not only
the
efficacy of damages, but also of other equitable remedies that may be more
appropriate in all the circumstances than an injunction.
So, for example,
sometimes undue detriment and inconvenience to the defendant can be avoided,
whilst at the same time the plaintiff
is sufficiently protected, if the
defendant is required to keep  an
account".</i><br><br>13   	In<b> </b><i>Mitchell v Henry</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2015%20Ch%20D%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 15 Ch D 181</a> the judgment of James L J at 192 includes the following
passage: <br><br><i>"Therefore, on the balance of convenience and inconvenience,
and having regard to the fact that the decision of the Master of the
Rolls was
in favour of the Defendants, which ought not to be overlooked on an
interlocutory application, I am of opinion that the
better way will be to let
the motion stand until the hearing, the Defendants keeping an
account".</i><br><br>14   	Spry at page 449 further
states:<br><br><i>"If the keeping of an account is proposed, then  'the
substantial question is whether the balance of convenience will be better served
in the circumstances of the case by adopting that course or by granting an
injunction until the trial.'".</i><br><br>15   	In<b>
</b><i>Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1968/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20118%20CLR%20618" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 118 CLR 618</a>
the judgment of Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ includes the following
passage (at 625):<br><br><i>"The defendant offered before McTiernan J, and has
offered again on this appeal, to submit to an order that it keep full and proper
accounts of all sales of its substance hetacillin, showing the quantities sold,
the sale prices, the profits therefrom and the manner
of calculating the
profits, every sale of hetacillin being treated as having been made in place of
a sale of the plaintiff's substance
ampicillin. The order under appeal, as drawn
up, is a bare order that the defendant keep an account of all monies received or
to
be received by it by reason of the sale or use of hetacillin in Australia. A
variation of the order would therefore be necessary
in any event; but <u>the
substantial question is whether the balance of convenience will be better served
in the circumstances of the case by adopting
that course or by granting an
injunction until the trial</u>."  (emphasis
added)</i><br><br>16   	Spry continues (at
449-450):<br><br><i>"There is no single rule by which it can be ascertained when
an interlocutory injunction will be ordered in any particular circumstances,
or
an account will be ordered to be kept instead. The court exercises a general
discretion, and in exercising this discretion it
takes into account inter alia
whether in the absence of an injunction the plaintiff may suffer substantial
loss to his goodwill <u>or else damage that is not able to be quantified
accurately</u>, or whether, despite an undertaking by the plaintiff as to
damages, the grant of an injunction would work undue hardship on the defendant
...  A further consideration, which is here of particular importance, is the
degree of probability with which it appears that the
plaintiff will ultimately
succeed at the final hearing; for if his case appears to be strong, 
considerations of hardship to the
defendant will receive correspondingly less
weight ...  Hence where an imminent breach of trust or of a special fiduciary
duty is
established, an injunction is, save in exceptional circumstances,
granted in a restraint. Whether and to what extent legal damages
may be
available is hence often a matter of importance in regard to the balance of
justice, although here account must be taken also
of such other possible courses
as requiring an undertaking to keep an
account".</i><br><br>17   	At 465-466, Spry deals under the
heading "The Inappropriateness of Alternative Remedies" with the topic of
interlocutory injunctions:<br><br><i>"When a court of equity is determining
whether it is appropriate that an interlocutory injunction should be granted
either to preserve
the status quo or otherwise to regulate the rights of the
parties in the most just manner that is possible pending the final hearing,
it
takes account, in particular, of the availability of other remedies that are
open to the plaintiff, whether of a legal or equitable
nature ...  A further
question often arises whether it is more just that the defendant should be
required to keep an account of particular
profits made by him, by reference to
which he may, if necessary, be required at the final hearing to compensate the
plaintiff if
it is appropriate to do so, rather than that an interlocutory
injunction should at once issue against him. Whether this course should
be
adopted depends largely on questions of hardship and on the balance of justice
generally."</i><br><br>18   	In <i>Plimpton v Spiller</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%204%20Ch%20D%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876)
4 Ch D 286</a>, the following passage appears (at 289) in the judgment of James L
J:<br><br><i>"There will always be, no doubt, the greatest possible difficulty
in determining what is the best mode of keeping things in statu
quo - for that
is really what the Court has to do - to keep things in statu quo - until the
final decision of the question; and then,
of course, the Court says, <u>'We will
not stop a going trade. We will not adopt a course which will result in very
great difficulty in giving compensation on the
one side or on the other'.</u> 
We have to deal with it <u>as a practical question in the best we way we can
</u>.  I think, on the whole, that the Master of the Rolls has made the right
the order, viz, by granting the injunction and putting the
Plaintiff upon an
undertaking to abide by such order (if any) as to damages as the Court may think
fit to make if he should ultimately
turn out to be in the wrong; and that it
would not be right in this case merely to put the Defendant upon the terms of
keeping an
account". </i> (emphasis added)<br><br>19   	Spry at
466 - 467 continues:<br><br><i>"Sometimes, however, further matters must be
taken into account, such as acquiescence or laches on the part of the 
plaintiff, for
such considerations as laches depend on the consequences of the
grant of the particular relief that is sought, and through delay
it may have
become unjust to grant one remedy, but yet not unjust to grant
another.</i><br><br><i>Often the matters that would cause undue prejudice or
hardship to the plaintiff, if he were confined to damages, serve also to render
insufficient the taking of an account by the defendant.  Further, sometimes
difficulties arise in ensuring that an accurate account
will be able to be
taken, and often it is doubtful whether the actual profit that will be obtained
by the defendant, if he is not
restrained, will reflect sufficiently the loss
that may meanwhile be suffered by the plaintiff.  Nonetheless, on some occasions
it
is found that it is only by refusing an interlocutory injunction and
insisting that an account be kept instead that undue hardship
can be avoided, so
that on the one hand the defendant is not prevented from proceeding with matters
of importance to him, and on
other hand the plaintiff is left with a remedy that
is appropriate in the particular circumstances in question.  So, it is sometimes
appropriate that the defendant should not be restrained from carrying on a
particular business alleged to be being carried on in
breach of the rights of
the plaintiff, since the grant of an interlocutory injunction would cause
disproportionate hardship to him,
and yet would not benefit the plaintiff to a
corresponding degree; and in these cases, the refusal of an interlocutory
injunction
may be made conditional on the defendants giving an undertaking to
keep an account".</i><br><br>20   	In <i>Bridson v McAlpine</i>
<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1845/530.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1845] EngR 530</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281845%29%2050%20ER%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1845) 50 ER 90</a> at 91, Lord Langdale observed generally:<br><br><i>"According to
the doubt which may exist in the mind of the court upon the facts, and according
to the degree of inconvenience, to
the parties, the Court, not thinking fit to
grant the injunction at the time, may take one of several courses; - it may
either refuse
to grant the injunction simply, or it may refuse it on the terms
of the parties undertaking to keep an account, or it may direct
the motion to
stand over, on the terms of the plaintiff proceeding to a trial at
law".</i><br><br>21   	At 468 Spry continues:<br><br><i>"Yet as a
matter of convenience, it is often found to be preferable, if an injunction is
to be refused, to make an interlocutory order
requiring separate accounts to be
kept, or even requiring specified proceeds to be kept separately from other
monies, in order to
simplify proof or else to avoid various problems as to
tracing".</i><br><br>22   	In Meagher Gummow and Lehane Equity
Doctines and Remedies in paragraph 2504, the learned authors put the matter as
follows:<br><br><i>"If one asks not in what cases would equity refrain from
ordering an account in aid of a common law right, but in what cases could
it
decree an account in aid of such a right, one might suggest the following six
categories".</i><br><br>23   	There are then set out six
categories, the second of which is in the following terms:<br><br><i>"Secondly,
where, although the right relied on by the plaintiff was legal, the parties
stood in a quasi fiduciary relationship, or
a relationship of confidence.  A
typical example was the principal and agent relationship. In this case, an
account will usually
(but not necessarily) be decreed on behalf of the principal
against the agent, the former having reposed confidence to the latter
and not
being able to ascertain, the true state of affairs except on discovery, which
could not be had at common law".</i><br><br>24   	The fourth
category is put as follows:<br><br><i>"Fourthly, in the vaguely defined number
of cases where an account would be too complicated to settle at law, where the
accounts were
too entangled to be left to a
jury...".</i><br><br>25   	The fifth category deals with the case
of legal waste.<br><br>26   	The seventh category is put as
follows:<br><br><i>"Seventhly, and perhaps most interestingly, there were those
cases where not to order an account would abort the plaintiff's rights;
these
were cases where the plaintiff would have had a legal right to be paid money
from the defendant if only the defendant had not
prevented the plaintiff's
rights accruing".</i><br><br>27   	The following passage is
extracted from <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co v South Eastern Railway
Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281891%2d94%29%20All%20ER%201610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1891-94) All E R Rep 1610</a> at 1615:<br><br><i>&#8220;Secondly, where the
plaintiff would have had a legal right to have money ascertained and paid to him
by the defendant, if the
defendant had not wrongfully prevented such right from
accruing to the plaintiff.  In such a case a court of law could only give
unliquidated damages for the defendant&#8217;s wrongful act;  and there was
often no machinery for satisfactorily ascertaining what
would have been due and
payable if the defendant had acted as he ought to have done, and ordered him to
pay the amount, McIntosh
v Great Western Railway Company <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1848/1032.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1850] EngR 684</a>; (1865, 2 De G &amp; Sm
758;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20Giff%20683" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 Giff 683</a>;  2 Mac &amp; G 74) is the leading authority on this class of
case.&#8221;  </i><br><br>28   	The passage in <i>McIntosh v
Great Western Railway Company</i> (1865) 42 ER at 190 is in the following
terms:<br><br><i>&#8221;The Plaintiff's interests and rights may be well
protected by an account being kept by the Defendants such as I propose to
require;  indeed, I think the Plaintiffs may gain by the injunction being
dissolved, but can scarcely be damnified;  because if the
Defendants be
restrained in the terms of the injunction, passengers and traffic may be
prevented from being conveyed by the Defendant's
railway which never might have
gone by the Plaintiffs, and as to all such there would be a loss both to the
Plaintiffs and Defendants,
and, if the Plaintiffs should ultimately fail in
establishing their equity, there is no mode by which the Defendants could be
indemnified
against such loss;  whereas, if the defendants are not restrained,
and keep an account of all passengers and traffic which it is
supposed may
interfere with the Plaintiffs equity, the Plaintiffs, upon the establishment of
their equity, may be benefited by the
result of such an
account".</i><br><br>29   	Meagher Gummow and Lehane at p 631
further make the point that it is not suggested that the categories to which
they have referred
are closed.<br><br>30   	The plaintiffs have
sought to rely not only on those categories to which I have referred above but
additionally upon the category
described by Meagher Gummow and Lehane as
circumstances in which an account will be taken in industrial property cases
such as passing
off and infringement of patent or trademark
cases.<br><br>31   	Parkinson, in <i>The Principles of Equity</i>
at p 901 states:<br><br><i>"In interlocutory proceedings involving infringement
of intellectual property rights, a defendant may be put on terms to keep
separate
accounts where an interlocutory injunction is
refused".</i><br><br>32   	The judgment in its reserved form
makes plain what are the plaintiff's claims, inter alia, to relief in respect of
alleged breaches
of fiduciary obligation. It is clear enough that situations
involving relief sought for claimed breaches of fiduciary obligation
involve
plaintiffs entitled to seek, subject to being able to prove their case,
equitable compensation or an account.  That one circumstance
taken alone, and
without regard to any other aspect of the plaintiffs&#8217; pleadings, furnishes
the plaintiffs, on the appropriate
principles with the necessary juridical basis
for pressing for an interlocutory order for the keeping of accounts. That is of
course
not the only basis upon which such an order may be
made.<br><br>33   	The plaintiffs rely, inter alia, upon the
provisions of the Supreme Court rules dealing with interim preservation of
property.
 It is unnecessary to set out here the whole of the relevant
provisions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p28" class="autolink_findacts">part 28</a>, save to refer to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p28" class="autolink_findacts">part 28</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2</a>
(1).<br><br>34   	The plaintiffs further rely, as setting a
jurisdictional basis for the making of the order for accounts in the present
case,
upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>, which is of course the
section giving to the court power at any stage in the proceedings by
interlocutory or other injunction, to
restrain any threatened or apprehended
breach of contract or other injury.  Here the plaintiffs, as I have understood
it, submit
that under that head of power, an order may be made by the Court for
the keeping of accounts, being in effect an
injunction.<br><br>35   	To my mind, the serious case issues
having been  identified and on an interlocutory basis clearly spelt out in the
reserved
judgment, the plaintiffs have made good their case seeking to have an
order that an account be kept. The plaintiffs are seeking equitable
relief
including equitable compensation for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in
respect of which the Court has held that there
is a serious question to be
tried.  I further accept that even if the plaintiffs were claiming only damages,
the present by reason,
inter alia, of the fiduciary claims is one of those cases
in which Equity would assist with a decree of an account in an appropriate
form.<br><br>36   	To my mind, the matters put forward by the
defendants as to the suggested inconvenience and or difficulties involved in the
keeping of an account are, at the end of the day, without substance at this
case, at this time, when one takes into account the matters
the subject of the
reserved judgment.<br><br>37   	Having said that, I do not accept
that the form in which the plaintiffs have sought to propound the proposed
order, sets out
the form of order which should be made. To my mind the
appropriate order to be made is an order which, subject to first specifying
the
definitional section of the order, which will be in the form of the proposed
amended notice of motion, would read as follows:<br><br><i>"Order that, until
the determination of these proceedings, or further order, each of National
Markets Group Limited ("NMG") Australian
Automated Quotation Market (AUSMAQ)
System Limited and National Australia Bank Limited (NAB) by themselves and their
representative
servants and agents do everything on the part of each necessary
to keep and procure to be kept a record of the profits made by (a)
the AUSMAQ
Service (b) NAB's Maple Leaf (Operation First Choice) Project and Maple Leaf
(Operation First Choice) Product; (c) the
NAB&#8217;s Gateway Project and
Gateway Product; (d) the NAB's Margin Lending Project and Margin Lending
Product; (e) the NAB's FX
Auto Dealing Project and FX Auto Dealing
Product".</i><br><br>38   	To my mind the case for an account
falls further within the category of cases of which <i>McIntosh v Great Western
Railway Company</i> was the leading
authority.<br><br>39   	Plainly, the trial judge will ultimately
have to determine whether Idoport has the legal rights for which it contends and
whether
the defendants, or any of them, can be said to have wrongfully prevented
such rights from accruing to Idoport.<br><br>40   	At an
interlocutory stage that basis, together with the plaintiffs fiduciary
obligation case, and the other matters earlier
referred to, provide a juridical
basis for the Court making the orders to which I have
referred.<br><br>41   	As indicated in the reserved judgement,
the balance of convenience is "heavily in favour the making of an order for the
keeping
of separate accounts and records, providing that such an order can be
framed with sufficient  specificity to permit its enforcement&#8221;.
 To my
mind, the form of order to which I have referred is the appropriate form of
order in the case.<br><br><b>Costs of the Interlocutory
Application</b><br><br>42   	I turn then to the question of the
costs of the interlocutory application and the manner in which they should be
dealt with.<br><br>43   	Costs, as is plain, are at all times in
the discretion of the Court. This is a case in which the interlocutory
application raised
a number of particularly complex questions both of principle
and of fact and of application of principle to fact. It is again, in
relation to
costs, unnecessary to repeat the findings in the interlocutory judgment which
were generally that the plaintiffs had
established a serious case for trial on
many issues and causes of action and which dealt with balance of convenience
issues.  For
the reasons given in the judgment, the Court&#8217;s discretion was
exercised against the granting to the plaintiffs of any of the
interlocutory
relief sought save for the matter of the keeping of
accounts.<br><br>44   	In paragraph 174 of the reserved judgment
the following appears:<br><br><i>"It has to be said that the present is a very
difficult case insofar as the interlocutory motion is concerned. The respective
cases
clearly cry out for determination at a final hearing, which hearing may be
expected to take an extended time and to involve voluminous
documents and
evidence given by numerous witnesses, including many witnesses at expert level.
In a curious way the task of a Judge
in relation to the final hearing may be
expected to be far easier than the task of determining this interlocutory
motion, because
on the final hearing all the evidence ought to be before the
Court, and final, as opposed to interim, decisions both as to principle
and as
to fact, and as to the application of principles to facts can be
given."</i><br><br>45   	The plaintiffs have submitted that the
following matters should be taken into account in relation to the costs
issue:<br><br>(a) 	The defendants are said to have refused and failed to respond
in any substantial way to the plaintiffs' complaints made in correspondence
over
a considerable period until they were compelled to file some affidavits in
answer to those of the plaintiffs on the interlocutory
application. Even then,
they are said to have studiously avoided any person with direct first hand
knowledge of any relevant evidence
going into evidence (with the exception of Mr
Purcell and Ms Cox).<br><br>(b) 	The Court has found that there is a serious
case to be tried in relation to the manner of the plaintiffs'
allegations.<br><br>(c) 	The plaintiffs have been successful in obtaining some
relief.<br><br>(d) 	A significant ground for the Court's refusal to grant the
bulk of the relief sought by the plaintiffs in the amended notice of
motion is
said to be by reason of the plaintiffs' delay and not for reasons of a failure
to establish a serious question to be tried
or the balance of
convenience.<br><br>(e) 	The relevant factor to the Court is said to have been
the inadequacy of the plaintiffs' undertaking as to damages in the circumstances
where an open view, and one which the plaintiffs assert, is that a reason for
the inadequacy is the plaintiffs failure to receive
performance bonuses which
they should have received of the consultancy agreement.<br><br>(f) 	The
management committee relief is said only to have been refused on the balance of
convenience at this stage in these proceedings.<br><br>(g) 	The motion is said
to have been heard in the context of the solicitors for the defendants asserting
that "there is no basis in
fact or in law for any of the relief sought". (Page 3
letter from Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page to Withnell Hetherington dated
21
July 1999).<br><br>46   	The plaintiffs submit that having regard
to their success on the serious question to be tried issues and the fact that in
relation
to much of the interlocutory relief, the significant reason for failure
was delay, the appropriate order in the circumstances is
that the costs of the
amended motion be the plaintiffs' costs in the cause. This is said to reflect
the fact that the plaintiffs
were put in a difficult  position of perceiving the
need to make the application through the unavailability of other legal relief
to
protect their position and being compelled to make the application because of
the defendants' conduct and refusal to countenance
any interim commercial
arrangements.<br><br>47   	The plaintiffs also submit that this
would reflect what is suggested as the substantial success of the plaintiffs on
the issue
of serious questions to be tried.<br><br>48   	The
plaintiffs further submit that this would recognise that if the plaintiffs are
not ultimately successful at the final trial
they will not obtain their costs in
relation to the notice of motion.<br><br>49   	The plaintiffs
secondary submission is that the costs of the amended notice of motion should be
costs in the cause. This is
said to reflect the fact that the ultimate
successful party will "pick up their costs of the notice of motion". Such an
order is
said to also recognise that the substantial airing of the issues on the
amended motion is said to lead to a reduction in the final
hearing time and a
better understanding for the Court of relevant matters at the final hearing and
in relation to other interlocutory
disputes until that time. It is said to also
recognise that each party has been successful in relation to aspects of the
amended
notice of motion.<br><br>50   	The defendants, on the
other hand, submit that an application for extraordinary interlocutory relief
has been made, persisted
in and failed when, so the defendants submit, it is and
has at all times been clear that the application was deemed to failure and
that
the application was staged for the purposes of attracting adverse
policy.<br><br>51   	The defendants submit that in those
circumstances the Court would be justified in awarding indemnity costs against
the applicants
and submit that the Court would not hesitate in awarding
party/party costs against the applicants.<br><br>52   	The
defendants submissions are that the substantive claim in the motion was for the
appointment of a receiver and that this
application was made and persisted with
when the applicants, and or their legal representatives, knew or ought to have
known that:<br><br>(a) 	Appointment of a receiver was inconceivable in the
present circumstances.<br><br>(b) 	The appointment of a receiver is an
extraordinary and destructive form of relief.  The mere bringing of such an
application is
capable of causing damage to trading entities.<br><br>(c) 	A
receiver is not an entrepreneur who will carry out the wishes of the
parties.<br><br>53   	The defendants make the point that the
express basis of the appointment was, on the defendants' submission, to carry
into effect
AUSMAQ's plans for business expansion throughout the
world.<br><br>54   	The defendants further submit
that:<br><br>(a)	No effective undertaking as to damages was proffered despite
the clearest statements in the cases that this would be fatal to
the
application.<br><br>(b) 	The applicants had been guilty of extraordinary delay
(see paragraph 344 of the judgment) which the defendants submit was deliberate
and as to which the applicants advanced no proper explanation.<br><br>(c) 	The
applicants' claim is for unliquidated damages.<br><br>55   	The
defendants further submit that the claims in the motion for various ancillary
injunctions and orders in the nature of interlocutory
specific performance were
flawed for several reasons, that is to say the absence of an effective
undertaking, laches, the applicants'
status as claimants for unliquidated
damages and the notoriously limited circumstances in which the Court will grant
mandatory interlocutory
relief.<br><br>56   	The defendants rely
upon the fact that notwithstanding these obvious obstacles to the claimants, the
application pursued the
motion.<br><br>57   	To my mind in this
most unusual case where the parties respective rights can only be properly
determined at the final hearing
and where the plaintiffs succeeded on the
serious issue for trial issues and obtained an order for the keeping of
accounts, the appropriate
exercise of the Court's discretion is to order that
the costs of the amended notice of motion should be costs in the
cause.<br><br><b>Ancilliary Matters</b><br><br>58   	Following
the giving of the above reasons, Mr Hughes, of Senior Counsel for the
defendants, was given an opportunity to address
on matters arising from and
relating to these reasons.<br><br>59   	It was the
defendants&#8217; submission first that any order which is to be made should be
expressly made as operating in relation
to the future.  That is a matter which
was and remains the Court's intention and is not opposed by the plaintiffs. 
When the short
minutes of order are brought in they should reflect this
position.<br><br>60   	Mr Hughes then submitted that it would
take some time for the Bank to work out a system for segregating expenses of and
apportioning
expenses of and relating to the subject services, projects or
products, so as to be in a position to apportion them.  The submission
was that
the operation of the order necessarily required to be suspended for a period to
permit the defendants to work out a system
so that the order may be complied
with. That matter likewise is not opposed by the plaintiffs.  The short minutes
of order when they
are brought in are to make provisions for the order to be
suspended for a period of 14 days to permit the defendants to carry out
those
steps.<br><br>61   	Mr Hughes then raised with the Court the
question of the undertaking as to damages being proffered by the plaintiffs
making
the point that this was not a matter expressly dealt with in the reasons
for judgment.<br><br>62   	In giving those reasons I was quite
cognisant that from its inception and through the whole of the hearing of the
interlocutory
motion, the plaintiffs had sought several strands of relief upon
the basis that an undertaking as to damages was proffered by the
plaintiffs, and
was so proffered notwithstanding the attack by the defendants upon the worth of
the undertaking.  To my mind and
notwithstanding the findings in the reserved
judgment as to the inadequacy of the undertaking as to damages in respect of the
receivership
orders sought and in respect of the claims to orders seeking to
bring NMG&#8217;s and AUSMAQ System&#8217;s operations under the
rubric of NMG,
the undertaking is altogether another matter when proffered and accepted on the
making of an order to keep an account.
 The balance of convenience was and is in
favour of the making of that order and the usual undertaking as to damages is to
be taken
in that regard.  Whilst the adequacy of the undertaking is of relevance
as a factor in relation to whether or not the keeping of
an account ought be
ordered, it is by no means the only relevant factor.  In indicating in the
reserved judgment that the balance
of convenience was heavily in favour of the
making of such an order, the court took into account all of the matters dealt
with in
the reserved judgment.  Of course the plaintiff&#8217;s very worth is
dependent in large measure upon the ultimate result on the
final hearing and the
keeping of an account of profits is an interim
order.<br><br>63   	Hence it is entirely appropriate that, and
the Court requires that, as a condition of the granting of the order for
accounts,
the usual undertaking as to damages be forthcoming and the short
minutes of order when they are brought in should, in the usual way,
make this
plain.<br><br><b>Fixing the Proceedings for
Hearing</b><br><br>64   	In the judgment handed down on 19 August
1999 the Court made plain that the plaintiffs had established a serious case for
trial
in relation to many of their allegations and that the Court accepted the
pressing significance and urgency attaching to the case
and attaching to MMG's
claims of an ongoing and radical undermining of its contractual rights. The
judgment includes the statement:<br><br><i>"I have come to the conclusion that
the case is in all likelihood one appropriate to be fixed for final hearing on
the first Monday
in May 2000. The parties will have an opportunity to adduce
evidence and direct submissions on the hearing day and the matter will
be before
the Court on Friday 27 August 1999 on which date a final hearing date will be
fixed."</i><br><br>65   	Lengthy and detailed submission have now
been received from all parties in relation to the past chronology and directions
given
in relation to proceedings and in relation to future
timetable.<br><br>66   	Both parties have further had an
opportunity to address the Court on matters going to the appropriate hearing
date which is
to be fixed and going to their respective suggested difficulties
with one another's proposed timetables.<br><br>67   	Taking into
account all of those submissions and doing the best that I can, as a matter of
procedural fairness, to adjudicate
between on the one hand, the pressing urgency
of bringing the case to a final hearing and, on the other hand, the necessity to
ensure
that each party has a full and proper opportunity to present its own case
and to respond to the opponents case, I have come to the
firm conclusion that
the hearing should be fixed to commence on 15 May
2000.<br><br>68   	The short minutes of order to be brought in
early next week should then identify that date as the fixture for
hearing.<br><br><b>Further Directions</b><br><br>69   	A number
of other directions have been the subject of submissions.  In the first instance
I propose to vacate all existing pre-trial
directions excluding, of course, any
orders relating to confidentiality matters and undertakings and the
like.<br><br>70   	I am then disposed to give the following
directions which will be the subject of the short minutes to be brought in early
next
week by counsel.<br><br>71   	The first is that the
transcript is to record that all statements on which the plaintiffs propose to
rely in chief, including
the statement in affidavit form of Mr Martin, have now
been served.<br><br>72   	Secondly, the time for the defendants
to file and serve statements in relation to the issues concerning the
development and
operation of the bank projects, being one segment of the
defendants' case on liability, is to be extended to 6 December
1999.<br><br>73   	The time for the defendants to file and serve
statements in relation to the issues concerning the events following the
commencement
of the consultancy agreement related to the alleged breaches
referred to in paragraphs 50 to 54, 56, 56.2, 56.3 and 57 of the Statement
of
Claim, being the further segment of the defendants' liability statements, will
be extended to 14 January 2000.<br><br>74   	The time for the
defendants to file and serve statements in relation to issues of causation and
damages is extended to 14 January
2000.<br><br>75   	The time for
the filing and serving of statements of the plaintiffs in reply is to be
extended to 20 March 2000.<br><br>76   	The time for the
plaintiffs to file and serve their final lists on discovery and so make
discovery is extended to 24 September
1999.<br><br>77   	The time
for the defendants to file and serve their list of documents in relation to the
FX Auto Dealing project and Margin
Lending projects and products is to be
extended to 29 September 1999.<br><br>78   	The time for the
defendants to file and serve their list of documents in relation to the Gateway
Maple Leaf projects and products
is to be extended to 26 October
1999.<br><br>79   	The time for the defendants to file and serve
a list of documents in relation to the issues concerning the events following
the commencement of the consultancy agreement is to be extended to 14 December
1999.<br><br>80   	The particulars of amendments to the second
further amended statement of claim sought by the defendants on 25 May 1999 are
to
be provided by the plaintiffs on or before 10 September
1999.<br><br>81   	The plaintiffs are to file and serve a third
amended statement of claim with such amendments as may be appropriate claiming
any relief, if it is to be pressed, relating to the Independence One project and
the Remote Wealth project or by way of removing
from the pleading reference to
those projects on or before 20 September 1999.<br><br>82   	The
plaintiffs are also to file and serve such amendments to their summons on or
before 20 September 1999 as are appropriate
to embrace such relief to be
pressed, if any, or the deletion of such relief, as may be related to the
Independence One and Remote
Wealth projects.<br><br>83   	The
defendants are to file and serve their amended defence by 11 October
1999.<br><br>84   	The plaintiffs are to file and serve any reply
by 15 October 1999.<br><br>85   	Liberty is to be granted to any
party to apply on 7 days notice or such earlier notice as the Court on
application may be disposed
to permit is to be
granted.<br><br>86   	I will direct that if any party is unable
to comply with any of the above directions the matter be relisted on notice by
that
party within two days of the party becoming aware of its inability to
comply with any direction.<br><br>87   	Costs of and related to
the respective matters the subject of submissions, directions and orders of
today are to be costs of
the cause.<br><br><i>******</i><br><br><br>LAST
