<b><u>10631/99  -  JENNIFER ALDRED  v  EUROPEAN HIRE CARS PTY LIMITED,  JOHN
ANTHONY GALLUZZO and WILLIAM GRENVILLE PIERCE</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR :    The plaintiff in this summons was the recipient of a subpoena
to produce documents issued in connection with proceedings
in the Local Court
presided over by the third defendant magistrate in which proceedings the first
and second defendants were being
prosecuted for alleged offences contrary to
the Passenger Transport Act.  The foundational informations had been laid by
one Brian
Scarfe a regional manager of the Department of Transport.  The
plaintiff Jennifer Aldred is also a regional manager of that department.
 The
subpoena sought production of all files and contents relating to the defendants
together with training manuals, instructions,
procedure guidelines issued to
investigating officers of the Department of Transport for the purpose of
conducting the day to day
affairs of the officers investigation.
<P>

2	The issue raised by the plaintiff in seeking to have the subpoena set aside
was the absence of any legitimate forensic purpose.
 In these proceedings I
have been taken to portions of the transcript of the hearing before the third
defendant and it is apparent
that counsel for the first and second defendants
sought to demonstrate legitimate forensic purpose by asserting in effect that
the
informant was biased against the defendants, that is to say against the
defendant who is a natural person in particular and who is,
it was stated
without demur, the controlling mind of the corporate defendant.  It was never
intended that the informant be called
as a witness in the Local Court
proceedings nor, for that matter, was the plaintiff an intended witness.  
<P>

3	I should record that for reasons earlier given I refused an adjournment of
the hearing which was based upon the assertion by counsel
that he was taken by
surprise by amendments which I had allowed to the originating process.  It was
common ground that the affidavit
material essentially exhibited transcript of
the hearing at which counsel and the second defendant were personally present
together
with other material with which they were necessarily familiar.  In the
course of an exchange during submissions counsel remarked
that he would have
considered putting on evidence except that I had refused the adjournment.  He
did not indicate the nature of any
proposed evidence and I record that the
application for adjournment was not based upon any expressed wish to tender
evidence.
<P>

4	I would uphold the contention of senior counsel for the plaintiff that the
propositions on behalf of the defendants are misconceived.
 Although both the
plaintiff and the informant were employees of the Department of Transport it
does not demonstrate a legitimate
forensic purpose for requiring one employee
to produce certain documents that another employee may harbour a bias, even
less that
the issuer of the subpoena has a subjective perception of some bias.
It was stated without objection that there were many files relating
to the
defendants arising I gather out of disputes concerning the utilization of motor
vehicles for the transport of so-called celebrities
and whether such vehicles
had or needed to have requisite hire car registration and authority.
<P>

5	As counsel for the defendant stated in the course of submissions, much of the
argument in the Local Court centred upon whether
the subpoena represented
"fishing".  For my part, were I sitting at first instance, I would be persuaded
that this was the case but
my jurisdiction is not so wide as simply to
substitute any view of mine for that of the third defendant.
<P>

6	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the order requiring compliance with
the subpoena was interlocutory in nature and that
therefore on discretionary
grounds I should refuse relief.  Reference was made to the restrictions upon
grant of relief by way of
statutory prohibition pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s112.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 112</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> (as formerly in force) and, by way of analogy, to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s5f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5F</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act</a>.  There is an essential difference in that the plaintiff is
not a party to the proceedings in the Local Court and so far as her involvement
in the litigation is concerned it is limited to the requirement that she obey
the subpoena. The ruling was an ultimate determination
of the litigation
insofar as it concerned her.  
<P>

7	The relief sought by the plaintiff pursuant to the Amended Summons seeks
orders in the nature of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus
and relies upon the
affirmation of power declared in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> or,
alternatively in relation to the lastmentioned, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65</a> of that Act.  Some
legislative background needs to be mentioned.  The informations initiating the
proceedings in the Local Court
were laid in 1998.  The relevant orders by the
third defendant were made on 28 January 1999.  The Justices Legislation
Amendment
(Appeals) Act 1998 came into force on 1 March 1999.  The current
proceedings were commenced by summons in this Court issued on 18
March 1999.

<P>

8	Senior counsel for the plaintiff observed that the amending statute repealed
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> and substituted new provisions for appeals against
decisions by magistrates whether brought in the Supreme Court, District Court
or the Land and Environment Court.  He noted that the Act also repealed the
remedy in the nature of mandamus available pursuant to
s 134 and the
prohibition against certiorari under s 146 of the statute in its earlier form.
He further noted that the transitional
provisions of the Amendment Act
preserved  proceedings already commenced but not determined before that repeal.
These proceedings
were commenced as noted, after the repeal.  Therefore relief
was sought in the manner above described.  There is provision in the
schedule
preserving <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> as in force before repeal in respect of
orders made before that repeal, although s 134 appeared in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 6</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> was
concerned with the earlier procedures of stated case, prohibition and the like.
It was however explicitly stated by counsel for
the defendants that there was
no wish on the part of his clients potentially to expand the litigation by
reason of any actual or
perceived procedural defect.  In the circumstances I am
content to deal with the matter accordingly.
<P>

9	The short submissions on behalf of the plaintiff were that the following
errors of law appear on the face of the record.  First,
that in a contested
hearing, assertions by the second defendant of impropriety on the part of the
informant, which were challenged
in cross examination, must be accepted if not
inherently enforceable.  Second, alleged bias on the part of the informant who
was
not to be called as a witness, was relevant to the question of whether or
not there was a legitimate forensic purpose for the subpoena
and, third, that
assertions by the second defendant and secondhand hearsay were sufficient to
establish legitimate forensic purpose.
 Those errors are abundantly manifest in
the recorded exchanges in the transcript.  There is not in the conventional
sense a detailed
judgment consolidating the various matters.  I do not hold
there should be but, in that circumstance, it is appropriate to examine
the
expressions of view in the transcript leading to the ruling. In my view the
plaintiff is entitled to remedy.
<P>

10	It was common ground at the hearing that, despite objection to the subpoena,
there had been produced for inspection by the representatives
of the defendants
some 2000 pages of documentation.  This estimate was provided by counsel for
the defendants.  It would seem appropriate
then the order should be made in
terms of paragraph 2 of the summons but as the precise form of remedy was not
canvassed at the hearing
I will reserve liberty to apply.
<P>

11	The third defendant is restrained from granting access to any further
documents pursuant to the order for production under the
subpoena issued at the
request of the second defendant dated 13 January 1999.  
<P>

12	The first and second defendants are ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of
the summons.
<P>

13	Liberty to apply in respect of orders until 23 April 1999 upon two days
notice to other parties.
