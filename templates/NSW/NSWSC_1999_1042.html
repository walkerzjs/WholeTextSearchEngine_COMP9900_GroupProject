<P>

<b>50019/99	STANDARD CHARTERED BANK AUSTRALIA LTD &amp; ANOR   v   ALEC DEAN
&amp; ANOR </b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	This is an application by Alec Dean (the applicant) to set
aside a summary judgment of Rolfe J of 20 May 1999 (the summary
judgment) in
these proceedings (the principal proceedings) and in the event that the summary
judgment is set aside, seeking a stay
of the principal proceedings, in effect,
pending the determination of proceedings in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York (the
US proceedings).  The plaintiffs in the principal proceedings are
also the plaintiffs in the US proceedings.
<P>

2   	The summary judgment was in favour of the first plaintiff,
Standard Chartered Bank Australia Ltd (the bank) in the sum of 
A$5,910,797.68.
Rolfe J declined to give judgment in favour of the second plaintiff, the
receivers and managers (the receivers) of
Nuchem Australia Pty Ltd (Nuchem
Australia), on the basis that the bank had not called  "<i>upon it to meet that
liability having elected to join it as a plaintiff in [the principal]
proceedings</i>".
<P>

3   	Counsel for both parties have expressly accepted that the
summary judgment was limited to the applicant's liability under a
deed of
guarantee and indemnity of 11 September 1997 (the guarantee), given by him to
the bank in respect of Nuchem Australia's indebtedness
to the bank, and that
Rolfe J accepted the evidence of the bank establishing three acts of default by
Nuchem Australia under a facility
agreement of 9 September 1997 between it and
the bank (the facility) and an equitable charge of 19 September 1997 (the
charge) over
the assets and undertaking of Nuchem Australia in favour of the
bank.  Those acts of default were particularised in paragraph 29
of the bank's
contentions in its amended summons in the principal proceedings (the
contentions) as follows: 
<P>

<b>"Events of Default  and Appointment of Receivers and Managers</b>
<P>

29. Between April 1998 and 10 August 1998, events of default occurred pursuant
to the Finance Facility and pursuant to the Charge,
as follows:
<P>

(a)	at a date not presently known to <u>the first plaintiff</u>  but subsequent
to the execution of the Finance Facility, there was a change in the directors
of <u>the second plaintiff </u>which was not consented to by <u>the first
plaintiff </u>.
<P>

<center><b>Particulars  </b></center>
<P>


<P>

Herbert Ralph Moll resigned as a Director of <u>the second plaintiff</u>.
<P>

(b)	<u>the second plaintiff</u> failed to comply with its undertaking to give
promptly to <u>the first plaintiff</u> information and supporting evidence in
connection with the second plaintiff's business and  financial condition as
requested by the
first plaintiff.
<P>


<P>

<center><b>Particulars</b></center>
<P>


<P>

<u>The second plaintiff</u> failed to comply with requests made by or on behalf
of <u>the first plaintiff </u>from 5 August to 13 August 1998.
<P>

(c)	a material adverse change in the financial performance of a condition of
<u>the second plaintiff</u> occurred;
<P>


<P>

<center><b>Particulars</b></center>
<P>


<P>

A net deficiency of assets of <u>the second plaintiff</u> as at 31 March 1998

<P>

was estimated to be in the sum of AUD<u>$</u>686,000.00 compared to net assets
in the balance sheet provided by <u>the second plaintiff</u> to the <u>first
plaintiff</u> of <u>AUD$273,000.00</u> .
<P>

For the ten months prior to April 1998 <u>the second plaintiff</u> made a net
loss of <u>AUD$</u>1.55 million resulting in a net deficiency of assets of
AUD<u>$</u>781,494.00 as at 30 April 1998.
<P>

Telecommunications cable owned by <u>the second plaintiff</u> and listed by it
at a value of AUD<u>$</u>4,737,539.00 was, on 30 June 1998, valued at an
estimated <u>AUD$12,000.00</u>."
<P>

4   	In the principal proceedings the bank contended, inter
alia, that the applicant,  who was the first defendant in the principal
proceedings,  had fraudulently procured the issuing of  a letter of credit (the
letter of credit) in the sum of $4,000,000, pursuant
to the facility, to
facilitate the purchase of cable to satisfy purchase orders (the purchase
orders) said to have been placed with
Nuchem Australia by Telekom Malaysia,
Optus Vision, and Delta 3 Corporation, whereas no such purchase orders had been
issued.
<P>

5   	Although evidence was adduced before Rolfe J in the
principal proceedings which if, accepted, was relevant to the issue of
fraud
raised by the bank, Rolfe J limited his judgment to the applicant's liability
under the guarantee.
<P>

6   	The US proceedings were brought by the bank and the
receivers against the applicant and Marvin Billet (Billet) by summons dated
21
January 1999 seeking damages <i>"of not less than $1,000,000.00" </i>on several
causes of action, including one of fraud in the alleged conversion by the
applicant of marketable securities, said to be
the property of Nuchem Australia
and subject to the charge.  By his verified answer and counterclaim of 12 June
1999, those allegations
of fraud and related allegations were denied by the
applicant who claimed ownership of the subject securities and alleged that they
had never been the subject of the charge.
<P>

7   	In his counterclaim the applicant sought damages of <i>"not
less than the sum of $100 million (US)" </i>for wrongful appointment of the
receivers; for interference with Nuchem Australia's business opportunities; for
sale of its assets
"<i>at distressed prices,</i>" and for<i> "malicious
publication of false, misleading and inaccurate information regarding
Nuchem</i> [<i>Australia's and the applicant's]</i> <i>finances, credit and
business capabilities," </i>which resulted in the loss of certain business
transactions.  These business transactions were described by the applicant in
his counterclaim
as follows: 
<P>

"38. In or about April 1998, under the SCB credit facilities, Nuchem Australia
purchased telecommunications cable in the United
Kingdom. Said Cable, together
with existing inventory, had a resale value in the Asian market in excess of
$15 Million (Australia).
<P>

39. In or about April 1998, Nuchem entered into negotiations for the purchase
of real property in the United Kingdom for the sum
of &#163;17 million with a
down payment of &#163;660,000. Financing for said purchase had been arranged.

<P>

40. At the same time, Nuchem was in negotiations with two entities for the sale
of said UK property for the sum of &#163;27 million,
yielding a profit in the
amount of 10 million Pounds Sterling.
<P>

41. Commencing in or about October 1997, Nuchem Australia and Nuchem
Telecommunications developed a business plan, culminating in
a tender submitted
in December 1997, for the construction and installation of telecommunications
networks in Malaysia and Indonesia.
<P>

42. In connection with said tender, Nuchem Australia expended in excess of
$700,000 (US) for engineering studies, among other expenses,
to complete the
tender.
<P>

43. The anticipated revenue from this venture was in excess of $450 million
(US), with  profits generated to Nuchem totalling $45
million (US).
<P>

44. In or about August or September, 1997 Nuchem Australia purchased the assets
of Camcom, an Australian company, including its
patent rights and interests to
certain videoconferencing technologies,  for the sum of $1.5 million (US).
<P>

45. As of April, 1998, Nuchem Australia was in negotiations with an Indian
company for the sale of Camcom's patents and technologies
in an amount in
excess of $2 million (US).
<P>

46. As of June, 1998, Nuchem Australia was in the final stages of negotiating a
contract to provide telecommunications equipment
and engineering assistance for
he (sic) upgrading of Iranian telecommunications facilities.  The venture had
total anticipated revenues
of $250 million (US) and Nuchem's anticipated profit
was $60 million (US).
<P>

47. As of April, 1998, Nuchem was in negotiations with three Indian
telecommunication companies to perform services as systems integrators
and to
supply telecommunication equipment.  To that end Nuchem hired three engineering
consultants and expended approximately $50,000.00
(US) in developing the
tender.  Nuchem's anticipated profit, over a five year period, was $60 million
(US).
<P>

48. Continuing from 1993 to 1998, Nuchem Australia was the exclusive agent for
the distribution and sale of chemical products for
Helm AG, a German chemical
trading entity. As of August 1998, Nuchem had arrangements with Helm AG which
generated sales of $11 million
(Australian) annually, of which approximately 5
to10% was profit."
<P>

8   	Of the events immediately preceding the appointment of the
receivers on 25 August 1998 the applicant further asserted in his
counterclaim
as follows:
<P>

"49. In or about July, 1998, Nuchem, at the insistence of SCB, submitted to an
audit of its books and records by SCB's auditors,
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
("Deloitte").
<P>

50. In or about August 1998, numerous meetings were held with Glen Smith and
Darren Wilson, representing SCB and Dean, among others,
at SCB offices in
Sydney, Australia as a result of which it was agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, that
Nuchem would continue to trade and be supported by SCB and Nuchem have three
months from that date to provide purchase orders
to cover the $876,000 (US)
letter  of credit.
<P>

51. Between July and early August, 1998, additional letters of credit, totaling
approximately $250,000 (US) were extended to Nuchem
Australia.
<P>

52. SCB did not require further or additional collateral from Nuchem , NMUK,
NSA or Dean  with respect to any of the letters of
credit at that time.
<P>

53. Upon information and  belief, on or about August 25,1998, Nuchem Australia
was placed under receivership at the request of SCB.
<P>

54. There was no further communication between SCB and Dean from the date of
the last meeting referred to above and the time that
SCB requested that Nuchem
Australia be placed in receivership.
<P>

...
<P>

57. The receivership was without cause or justification."
<P>

9   	The hearing of the principal proceedings proceeded in the
absence of the applicant. In this application the applicant has given
evidence
in chief in the form of three affidavits sworn respectively, 17 September 1999
(the applicant's first affidavit), 30 September
1999 (the applicant's second
affidavit), and 8 October 1999 (the applicant's third affidavit), upon the
basis of  which it is submitted
that he has "<i>a real and arguable"
</i>defence to the causes of action under the guarantee.  In these affidavits
the applicant also gave reasons for his failure to enter
an appearance in the
principal proceedings, for failing to take any part in those proceedings and
for the delay in bringing this
application. 
<P>

10   	No attempt was made to provide evidence upon which it
could be found that the applicant had "<i>a real and arguable"</i> defence to
the case of fraud.  The only reference in the applicant's affidavit to the
purchase orders is to be found in paragraph
6 of the applicant's first
affidavit in which he stated that he "<i>[did] not know who prepared or signed
the application [for the letter of credit] or who would have provided allegedly
fraudulent purchase
orders in support of it".</i> In the applicant's third
affidavit he addressed the allegations in paragraph 15(b) of the contentions,
but the contents of that affidavit
do not directly address the allegation of
fraud or related causes of action particularised in the contentions (the fraud
case).
<P>

11   	It has not been submitted on behalf of the bank that the
applicant should not be allowed in to defend without credible evidence
of a
reasonable defence to the bank's fraud case and no evidence was adduced in the
bank's evidence in chief in the application to
advance the fraud case against
the applicant.  The bank sought to establish such a case in cross examination
of the applicant, but
in the exercise of discretion I took the view that cross
examination on those issues should be limited to matters going to the credit
of
the applicant.  Without defining the limit imposed upon that cross examination,
I was of the view that it would be inappropriate,
in the absence of a positive
case of fraud in the bank's case, to be asked to make a finding of fraud on
this application.  
<P>

12   	As it happened cross examination along that line ceased
with the applicant declining to answer a question on the ground that
it might
incriminate him.  By agreement of the parties I was not required to ascertain
whether there were reasonable grounds for
this objection under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.128</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  The transcript in relation to that matter, which appears at
pages 36 and 37, is inaccurately recorded.  What follows is a corrected
record.

<P>

"Q.	Accepting that Barclays Bank discounts the letter of credit issued by
Standard Chartered, won't you accept that the $3.7 million
dollars odd
deposited into Nuchem Multi Media account last year was the discounted sum
provided for the sale of cable by Nuchem Multi
Media to Nuchem  that we have
been talking about?
<P>

A.	Your Honour, I would prefer not to answer this question because this
question may incriminate me.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	Very well.
<P>

RYAN:	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 128</a>, your Honour. We would not be forcing Mr Dean to answer the
question.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	All I am looking at the section for is to achieve that result.   I
have no intention of requiring Mr Dean to provide
the answer.
<P>

RYAN:	Discretion under sub-section 5 that the Court may require,  but obviously
no compulsion on the Court so to do.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	I think the simplest course: Are the parties content with a general
ruling in the exercise of discretion that I decline
to require Mr Dean to
answer the question.
<P>

ALDRIDGE:	Yes.
<P>

RYAN: 	Yes, your Honour. I do not know whether it is acceptable to cut short a
number of questions.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	It is to be noted that the witness has declined to answer the
question on the ground that it might incriminate him.
 There are procedures
provided for that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  Both parties are content
with a general ruling that in the exercise of my discretion I will not require
the witness to answer the
question.
<P>

RYAN:	I had intended to ask Mr Dean further questions about receipt by him of
particular sums of money from the funds we have been
talking about.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	I think that would be covered by the last question also." 
<P>

(T 36.45 - 37.31)
<P>

13   	If the issue of there being an arguable defence to the
fraud case had been squarely before me and  had the applicant not been
required
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> to answer that question, I think it may
have been open to me to draw an inference adverse to the applicant from his
claim of privilege,
notwithstanding the general line of authority precluding
the court from drawing such an inference (see for example the article of
Mr
Justice Young, "Taking the Fifth"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2065%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20412" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 65 ALJ 412).</a>  However that is not the
case here and no inference adverse to the applicant should be, nor is it drawn,
from his claim of privilege.
 
<P>

14   	The passage quoted above is set out to underline the
limits imposed upon counsel for the bank in cross examination.  Although
no
attempt was made by the applicant to evidence an arguable defence to the fraud
case, nor was the point taken that such a case
should have been made by the
applicant, on reflection, had I reached a different conclusion in these
reasons, I would have required
the parties to further address me on that
question before proceeding to judgment. 
<P>

15   	The evidence in chief of the applicant was that he was
absent from Australia pursuing "<i>business opportunities"</i> for Nuchem
Australia and related corporations between August 1998 and until 13 September
1999, during which time his "<i>business commitments</i> <i>did not permit
[him] to return to Australia".  </i>The evidence concerning events immediately
preceding his departure is not entirely clear, nor, I think, consistent with
the assertions
of the applicant in his verified answer and counterclaim in the
US proceedings.  
<P>

16   	In the applicant's second affidavit he evidenced the fact
that Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (the investigating accountants), who
had been
appointed to investigate and report to the bank on the affairs of Nuchem
Australia, by their letter to him of 10 August
1998, had submitted their draft
report for the applicant's comments.  The applicant's reply was required by the
afternoon of 11 August
1998.
<P>

17   	The applicant said that he was unable to respond to the
draft report before it was forwarded to the bank by the investigating
accountants and that on 19 August 1998 he  received a letter of demand from the
bank and notice of termination of its obligations
under the facility.  The
bank's letter also sought information relating to a valuation of cable said to
belong to Nuchem Australia.
 The applicant said that he caused this information
to be forwarded to the bank on 21 August 1998 by "<i>the external accountant of
Nuchem Australia, Mr Herbert Moll </i>(Moll)<i>, of Bert Cameron, Accountants"
</i> in responding to the bank's letter of demand of 19 August 1998 (Moll's 21
August letter).  
<P>

18   	During cross examination the applicant stated that he left
Australia, approximately, on the 20th or 21st August 1998 and that
a few days
later he "<i>received a telephone call"</i> informing him that the receivers
had been appointed to Nuchem Australia.  It seems an extraordinary step to
leave Australia at that
time, even more extraordinary to remain absent from
Australia for over 12 months engaged on business activities of Nuchem
Australia:
 made even more extraordinary when placed in the context of a claim
for over "$100 million (US)" for lost business opportunities
and for preventing
the applicant from pursuing <i>"existing and potential business
opportunities".</i>
<P>

19   	Especially is that so when, on his own evidence in cross
examination, he had attended a meeting with the investigating accountants
at
which he had been accused of the most serious fraud.  His evidence on this
subject matter was as follows:  
<P>

"Q.	Prior to you leaving Australia in August 1998, there came a time, didn't
there, when you declined to discuss matters any further
with the
representatives of Deloittes?
<P>

A.	I declined to have discussions  with representatives of Deloittes and
Standard Chartered bank until the day I left Australia.
<P>

Q.	You declined, didn't you, to tell the representatives of Deloittes who it
was at Optus that you had been negotiating with for
the sale of cable.  Do you
remember that?
<P>

A.	No, I did not decline. Deloittes wanted to talk to senior members of Optus,
who I felt we know Optus.  We were dealing with them
for several years.  I did
not want at this point -  as in Optus had just changed there Optus Vision to
Optus Communication, just
trying to create a new relationship.  I did not want
anyone else to talk to them on my behalf.
<P>

Q.	For that reason, you declined to give them the information as to who was at
Optus with whom you had been negotiating?
<P>

A.	Whether I gave them information or not,  they are free to find out who the
purchasing managers were.
<P>

Q.	I also suggested to you you declined to discuss with them any negotiations
you might have had with Telekom Malaysia ?
<P>

A.	I did not decline anything regarding Telekom Malaysia, you Honour.  Telekom
Malaysia did not arise.  It was about Optus Vision
 and Telstra.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.   When was this?
<P>

A.	 During August 1998.
<P>

Q. 	98?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

RYAN:	 Q.  Didn't you take the view that you did not want to talk to the
representatives of Deloittes prior to leaving Australia
because you thought
they were going to close down the business of the company?
<P>

A.	No,  it wasn't.  They wrote a fax, your Honour.  In my absence I was in Fiji
seeing Telecom mall.  They wrote a fax.  It did
not put attention to anyone.
They just wrote a fax to Nuchem to the point that this company should be shut
down.  When I came back
from Fiji when I saw that fax, of course I was annoyed
because all the staff in the company had also seen that fax.  It was very,
very
damaging to Nuchem to get a fax from auditors who were supposed to do a routine
audit for the bank.  They sent a fax to the
company, not to any director or
something to that extent that this company should be shut down.  Eventually, I
was annoyed. 
<P>

Q.	When you got that fax from Mr Campbell of Deloittes, you were shocked and
you made the decision that you would not deal with
Deloittes any longer?
<P>

A.	That is not true, your Honour.  I complained to the bank and, at the request
of the bank, I made arrangements to go and meet
Mr Campbell.  Myself and Mr
Derry we visited Mr Campbell in the office.  This is not true I did not want to
deal with. 
<P>

Q.	You told the examining Magistrate in May of this year in Switzerland, "Mr
Campbell of Deloittes told me they were going to close
down my company, I was
shocked.  I wasn't ready to deal with them any longer.  I went back to my
office.  I wrote to the bank that
I refused to meet Deloittes  again.  I would
only assume my responsibility with the bank."  Do you remember giving that
evidence
?
<P>

A.	I remember that, but let me add the rest of it,  you Honour.  When I went to
meet Deloittes in their office myself and Mr Rafic
Derry, as soon as Mr
Campbell came in, after exchange of business cards, Mr Campbell's comments
were, "I know what you have done.
 You have bought the cables from United
Kingdom, supplied the cable Malaysia, sold the cable in Malaysia, and you have
pocketed the
money."  With those kind of remarks I said, "Okay, if that is your
opinion I don't want to be here."  And I left from his office.
<P>

Q.	And you knew that he wanted your version of events when he said these things
to you?
<P>

A.	Well, if somebody I meet, as soon as you go to the office and the opening
comment is like that.  I do not think it is very inviting
to sit there and say,
okay this is a mistake.  I did not have time and I did not want to be abused
and accused.  I mean, Deloittes
is who?
<P>

Q.	You did not defend your reputation?
<P>

A.	I don't remember I was in a Court of law.  There was a position made by a
person who I took time to visit and discuss things
with.  He accused me like
that just in the first five minutes.  I did not see a reason to be there any
more.  I came and I immediately
called the bank and told the bank the same
thing. I don't want to discuss matters with these people.  I know I am dealing
with you
people.  I answer to your questions."
<P>

(T 38.41 - 40.21)
<P>

20   	I think that the evidence is also clear that, on leaving
Australia, the applicant instructed Mr Martin Hirst (Hirst), a solicitor
with
Gadens Lawyers (Gadens), to assist Moll in his dealings with the bank over the
affairs of Nuchem Australia.  In giving those
instructions it seems reasonably
clear that he left no forwarding address and provided only a post office box
number in Blacktown,
which was that of a former employee, Mohammed Iqbal
(Iqbal), as his point of contact in Australia.  
<P>

21   	Gadens was not the only firm of solicitors with whom the
applicant had contact in Australia.  The applicant also gave instructions
from
time to time to Christopher Henaghan (Henaghan), a partner in the firm of
Henaghan McLean, in relation to the affairs of the
Dean Family Trust for whom
Henaghan acted.  The firm had as a consultant, Gail McLean (McLean), who was
the sister of the applicant.
 It is clear from Henaghan's evidence that the
applicant had not provided him with a forwarding address between August 1998
and September
1999 and, presumably, that was the case with McLean.  
<P>

22   	Both in the principal proceedings and the United States
proceedings the service of  initiating process was by substituted
service.  It
was in that way that Henaghan and Gadens received the bank's summons in the
principal proceedings.  
<P>

23   	It was the evidence of the applicant that he did not
become aware of the bringing of the principal proceedings until April
1999.
That is a very difficult proposition to accept.  I think that the evidence is
overwhelming that the applicant left behind him
in Australia a demand for
payment of several million dollars, the calling up of the facility, amidst
allegations of serious fraud
and chose quite deliberately to leave no
forwarding address or point of contact in Australia or elsewhere where he could
be communicated
with other than a post office box number belonging to Iqbal.

<P>

24   	The applicant's association with Iqbal is not without
significance.  Both prior to and up to the date of the hearing of the
application there existed a close personal relationship between the applicant
and Iqbal, so it is no particular wonder that Iqbal's
post office box number
should be selected by the applicant as a trusted repository for communications
from Gadens.  
<P>

25   	The evidence of the applicant of his relationship with
Iqbal is as follows: 
<P>

"HIS HONOUR:  Q.   Mr Dean, who is Mohammed Iqbal ?
<P>

A.	He used to work for Nuchem Australia as an accounts clerk.
<P>

Q.	When did you last have any contact with Mr Iqbal?
<P>

A.	I saw Mr Iqbal last week, your Honour.
<P>

Q.	And prior to that?
<P>

A.	I used to call Mr Iqbal sometimes from Malaysia that, I had spoken to Mr
Iqbal in late June after I became aware of the judgment.
 I have borrowed money
from Mr Iqbal to pay for some of my children's requirements.
<P>

Q.	And would it be fair to say that you are on close personal relations with
him?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	And have been so for some years?
<P>

A.	I would say since 1996, when Mohammed Iqbal joined Nuchem Australia.
<P>

Q.	And do you say that he did not inform you of the receipt of the summons in
February?
<P>

A.	No, your Honour."
<P>

(T 45.22 - 45.45)
<P>

26   	It was to that address, it may be inferred,  that Gadens
forwarded to the applicant on 19 February 1999 certain correspondence
between
Gadens and the solicitors for the bank together with the summons in the
principal proceedings.  It may also be inferred that
those documents were also
forwarded to Henaghan and Moll at that time.  Gaden's letter to the applicant
concluded with an invitation
to contact Hirst if the applicant wished him to do
"<i>anything in relation to the summons." </i> 
<P>

27   	There was no direct evidence that that letter was sent,
but no objection was taken to its tender on behalf of the bank in
circumstances
which required a re-opening of the bank's case.  It was acknowledged by counsel
for the applicant that the letter should
have been produced when called upon on
the first day of hearing in answer to a notice to produce given by the bank.
Apparently, it
was overlooked and produced on the second day.  When the
applicant was recalled to the witness box to answer questions in relation
to
Gaden's letter, he denied receipt of the letter and of the documents,
presumably, enclosed with it.  There is no suggestion that
the original letter
or accompanying documents were  returned to Gadens.  
<P>

28   	There is a further difficulty in accepting the evidence of
the applicant on this subject.  It was the evidence of Henaghan
that he had
been absent from his office on vacation until late March or early April 1999
and that upon his return he had a conversation
with Hirst arising out of the
order for substituted service in the principal proceedings.  At that time
Henaghan had received the
amended summons pursuant to the order  for
substituted service,  Henaghan gave the following evidence in relation to
documents that
he had received:
<P>

"Q.	 What did you do with the documents that you had received?
<P>

A.	 Earlier documents had been sent back to Mallesons, informing them that we
had no instructions to act and I had sent a couple
of letters to the Court
informing the documents were just left on my file, the substituted ones that
came when I was there, when
I arrived back in April.
<P>

Q.	I beg your pardon?
<P>

A.	They just remained in my office, the most recent set that were sent, the
amended summons.
<P>

Q.	You have never conveyed the content to Mr Dean?
<P>

A.	No, I haven't.
<P>

Q.	Even though you had been in contact with him?
<P>

A.	Only generally, I never had any instructions or a place to forward them to
him.
<P>

Q.	Mr Dean didn't request them?
<P>

A.	Not in my conversation, no, not at that time.
<P>

Q.	At any time ?
<P>

A.	Not from me, no.
<P>

Q.	Did you ever advise Mr Dean that he should take no steps in relation to the
proceedings?
<P>

A.	I didn't advise Mr Dean.  I said it was not necessary whilst negotiations
were taking place.
<P>

Q.	Did Mr Dean ever ask you to ensure  that any documents you were sent, were
not forwarded to him?
<P>

A.	No, he didn't.
<P>

Q. 	Did he ever ask you or say anything in words to that effect?
<P>

A.	No, he didn't."
<P>

(T 17.48 - 18.39)
<P>

29   	In referring to earlier documents I assume that those are
the documents referred to in Gaden's letter to the applicant of
19 February
1999.  Two things to observe about that evidence.  One is that it confirmed
that the applicant had left no forwarding
address or point of communication
with Henaghan which would enable him to contact the applicant and the second
observation is that,
the applicant, apparently did not need to know the
contents of the bank's summons, bearing in mind that the amended summons
particularised
the fraud case against the applicant.    
<P>

30   	In those circumstances I have considerable difficulty in
accepting the evidence of the applicant that he had no knowledge
of the summons
in the principal proceedings prior to April 1999 and, then, as a result of a
telephone conversation with Henaghan.
  If that evidence was accepted I would
also have to accept that Iqbal had not communicated with the applicant for over
a month and
that the applicant had not bothered to contact Hirst or Moll in
late February, March and early April, as, presumably, had he done
so he would
have been informed by them of the receipt of the summons.  
<P>

31   	I find the first proposition inherently improbable and as
to the latter it seems an extraordinary situation that a person
who had left
Australia in the circumstances earlier described in these reasons, if seriously
concerned with the affairs of Nuchem
Australia and his own personal reputation,
would have made no contact with Moll or someone responsible for dealing with
the bank
in relation to Nuchem Australia's affairs.  
<P>

32   	I think that the conduct of the applicant reflected a
studied incommunicado absence from Australia, consistent with the failure
of
the applicant to take any part in the principal proceedings when it became
known to him that those proceedings had been taken
by the bank.  It is the
evidence of the applicant, or it is submitted on his behalf, that such a
conclusion is inconsistent with
the conduct of the applicant in contesting the
US proceedings and with his evidence and that of Henaghan,  that Billet had
given
them to understand that the bank would take no further action in the
principal proceedings while negotiations for settlement between
the bank and
Billet, acting on behalf of the applicant, were afoot.
<P>

33   	There is some superficial attraction in the proposition
that a deliberate exercise not to take part in the principal proceedings
is at
odds with the applicant's contesting the US proceedings.  However I think that
inconsistency is more apparent than real.  In
the US proceedings the bank had
obtained an interlocutory injunction in the nature of a mareva injunction in a
succession of orders
commencing on 22 January 1999, with further orders in
February, March and April of 1999.  Amongst other things, that order had the
effect of freezing certain  assets  in Switzerland which in turn involved the
applicant in proceedings before an Examining Magistrate
at St Gallen in May
1999.  The effect of the US proceedings was described by the applicant as
follows: 
<P>

"A.	As far as I knew, Standard Chartered had started proceedings against me in
New York. I had been running short of funds, I also
had lawyers in New York who
was compiling a case against Oppenheimer Bank. Now, in this period, a very good
associate of mine Samasu
Taha, all his assets, his company assets were frozen
in Switzerland because of the proceedings against me in New York, that means
I
had to also help him to try to resolve the problem that he was in.  
<P>

I mean, the situation was completely overwhelming.  I mean how many places, how
many  things could I attend to?  So the best possible
thing for me to do was to
get somebody like Marvin Billet who is a very, very experienced person, he is a
lawyer, apart from that
he is a well known negotiator, to ask him to attend
with Standard Chartered and the best possible place was UK, the head office of
Standard Chartered, to talk to him and then, and see what can be resolved and
after that Marvin told me, "Okay, I have had one or
two telephone
conversations, but I need to be there."  So you know, all the problems that I
had, I had to arrange money to give to
Marvin Billet so that he could travel to
London to meet up with Standard Chartered to negotiate on my behalf."
<P>

(T 29.12 - 29.35)
<P>

34   	I think that in light of that evidence it is not
particularly surprising that the applicant was moved to defend the US
proceedings.
 It is also difficult to reconcile the bank's strong pursuit of
litigation in the US proceedings with the claim of the applicant
that he
understood that no steps would be taken in the principal proceedings during
then current negotiations on his behalf with
the bank.
<P>

35   	It was the applicant's evidence that he could not
understand why there should be two lots of proceedings instituted by the
bank
against him, so that one proceeds on the premise that he viewed the bank's
actions against him as stemming out of the same or
related circumstances.  One
asks rhetorically why one set of proceedings should be stayed informally during
negotiations while the
other was being vigorously prosecuted.  
<P>

36   	I have no reason to doubt that Henaghan was informed by
Billet on 25 April 1999, in a telephone conversation as follows: 
<P>

"2.  On or about 25 April 1999 I received a telephone call from Mr Marvin
Billet, Mr Dean's New York attorney, and we had a conversation
to the following
effect:
<P>

Marvin Billet:   "I am meeting with Standard Chartered's top people in the U.K.
Because of the proceedings in New York and  New
South Wales and whilst
negotiations are taking place between me and Standard Chartered, Standard
Chartered are interested in hearing
about Mr Dean's case against Walsh Manning
and CIBC Oppenheimer to see how they might get the benefit of that action".
<P>

Myself:   "Were you able to explain to the Bank the merits of Mr Dean's action
against Walsh Manning and Oppenheimer as well as
Mr Dean's counterclaim against
the Bank?"
<P>

Marvin Billet:   "Yes, I am discussing that with them.  The Bank has informed
me that while negotiations are ongoing nothing would
happen in respect of the
proceedings in New South Wales.  We are trying to achieve a settlement and
while negotiations are happening
nothing will happen."
<P>

Myself:    "Good, if there is any problems, contact us." "
<P>

It was the evidence of Henaghan that following his conversation with Billet he
relayed that information to the applicant.
<P>

37   	It is Henaghan's evidence that he had a conversation with
the applicant when contacted by the latter "<i>in around early April 1999".</i>
It is difficult to line that up with Henaghan's evidence that his conversation
with Billet occurred "<i>on or about 25 April 1999".</i>  The evidence of
Henaghan to which I refer is as follows:
<P>

"Q.	Were you surprised when Mr Billet rang you?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	And why weren't you surprised when Mr Billet rang you?
<P>

A.	Because I had occasion to speak to Mr Dean in around early April.  I had
been away for some five or six weeks on leave and in
around April there was an
order for substituted service and there were some documents at that time and Mr
Dean telephoned and contacted
me and I said there was now some proceedings,
confirmed there were some proceedings in New South Wales and he appeared
overwhelmed
at that point, because he went on and mentioned a lot of things
that were happening in his life at that time with various proceedings
around
various jurisdictions and he thought that he would, well, he said he would have
to do something about it because he couldn't
be everywhere at once. 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.   Because?
<P>

A.	Because he couldn't be everywhere at once.  There were proceedings in
America, he mentioned some proceedings in Switzerland that
he was involved in,
there was some counter claim in the United States, there were proceedings here
in Australia and he couldn't be
everywhere at once and he thought at that time
it was an idea to consolidate these matters with Standard Chartered, so he
would contact
Mr Billet and I indicated to Mr Dean I would have Mr Billet
contact me at some time if there are some negotiations going to take
place.
<P>

...
<P>

RYAN:    Q.   In relation to that matter, did you advise Mr Dean when he asked
you whether he should be doing anything in relation
to the New South Wales
proceedings, that if the negotiations didn't proceed, that is the settlement
negotiations were finished, that
he should take steps in relation to the New
South Wales proceedings ?
<P>

A.	No, the extent of my conversation was that there was no need whilst
negotiations were taking place.
<P>

Q.	And you didn't think it necessary to advise him that he should take steps in
relation to those proceedings, if the negotiations
came to an end?
<P>

A.	I mentioned to him that he should ask Mr Billet to try and get something in
writing if there was going to be a complete hold
on proceedings whilst
negotiations were taking place."
<P>

(T 15.55-16.24...16.50-17.7)
<P>

38   	That evidence suggests that Henaghan's conversation with
the applicant took place after there had been communications from
Billet
concerning a hold on the principal proceedings while negotiations were afoot
with the bank.  That fits in with paragraph 10
of the applicant's third
affidavit which was as follows: 
<P>

"I crave leave to refer to paragraph 5 of my affidavit dated 17 September 1999.
With respect to the conversation referred to in
that paragraph between myself
and Marvin Billet, I say that the conversation was to the following effect:
<P>

Myself	"I've been told by Chris Henaghan that Standard Chartered Bank have
agreed to put a stay on proceedings in New South Wales
while negotiations occur
between you and the bank."
<P>

Billet	"Yes, negotiations are on foot with the bank and they have informed me
that no further legal action will be taken in New
South Wales pending those
negotiations."
<P>

39   	The reference in that evidence to paragraph 5 of an
earlier affidavit of the applicant is a reference to the following material
which appeared in the applicant's first affidavit, namely:
<P>

"I first became aware of the Supreme Court of New South Wales  proceedings in
April 1999 from Chris Henaghan, of Henaghan McLean,
Solicitors, Victoria.
Shortly after that I spoke to my New York attorney, Mr Marvin Billet and he
informed me that negotiations were
on foot with the Bank, and that the Bank had
informed him that it would take no further legal action in New South Wales
pending those
negotiations.  I did nothing further until hearing of judgment
in the New South Wales Supreme Court proceedings in late June 1999
from Chris
Henaghan."
<P>

40   	On the reading of that evidence it would only be
consistent if there had been a telephone conversation between Henaghan and
the
applicant in early April 1999 when the applicant was said to have been aware of
the principal proceedings: a later telephone
conversation in April between
Billet and Henaghan, when Henaghan was informed that the principal proceedings
would be on hold during
negotiations with the bank, followed by a further
conversation between Henaghan and the applicant in which Billet's information
was
passed on to the applicant with the advice from Henaghan that the applicant
should<i> "get something in writing if there was to be a complete hold on
proceedings while negotiations were taking place." </i>
<P>

41   	That se	quence fits in with the following further evidence
of Henaghan:
<P>

"ALDRIDGE:   Q.   (By leave)  After you had the conversation with Mr Billet as
set out in paragraph 25 of your affidavit, did you
have  a conversation with Mr
Dean?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	Using the best words you can, what did you say to him and what did he say to
you?
<P>

A.	I told Mr Dean that Marvin Billet had contacted me and that there were some
negotiations going on regarding all matters, with
Standard Chartered that had
taken place and were still on foot and that to my understanding there would be
no further proceedings
to take place in New South Wales whilst negotiations
were going on.  Mr Dean asked me whether then he should be doing anything about
the New South Wales proceedings and I told him that there would be no need
whilst negotiations were going on."
<P>

(T 14.1 - 14.16)
<P>

42   	There is a problem with this sequence of events in the
unchallenged evidence of Charlotte Mary Feest (Feest) in her affidavit
sworn 29
September 1999.  Feest was the solicitor in the group legal department of the
bank in London who was personally involved
in the negotiations with Billet in
April 1999.  According to Feest the negotiations consisted of one meeting, one
telephone conversation
and a letter from the bank to Billet.  The meeting took
place on 14 April 1999 at the offices of the bank in London and, according
to
Feest, at no time did the bank offer to put the principal proceedings on hold
during those negotiations.  On the contrary, it
was Feest's evidence that the
following conversations took place:
<P>

"6.  At my meeting with Mr Billet on 14 April 1999, Mr Billet made a "without
prejudice" proposal on behalf of Dean which Bill Bruce
and I agreed to
consider.  We then had a conversation with Mr Billet in words to the following
effect:
<P>

CF/BB: "The New South Wales proceedings will not be stayed while we are
considering your proposal.  There is a directions hearing
in these proceedings
on 16 April 1999."
<P>

Mr Billet: "Would you be prepared to adjourn the directions hearing pending
further developments?"
<P>

CF/BB:  "No.  We will not agree to this."
<P>

...
<P>

CF:     "The Bank is unable to consider or investigate these unparticularised
allegations. If Mr Dean has something to say in response
to the proceedings
commenced against him in Australia, the United States or Switzerland, then he
must file an appearance and make
his allegations in the appropriate way."
<P>

Mr Billet: "I understand your position. I have been trying to convince Mr Dean
that he should defend the various proceedings against
him but I haven't
succeeded.""
<P>

43   	It is clear that Billet made a without prejudice offer at
that meeting which was rejected in a facsimile and letter to Billet
from the
bank on 23 April 1999.  The terms of that letter follow:
<P>

"Thank you for taking the time and trouble to meet with me in London last
week.
<P>

As discussed, I have forwarded the copy of the proposed proceeding by Alec Dean
against, inter alia, CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. and
Walsh Manning Securities, LLC,
to our US lawyers for their consideration.  We have subsequently received their
advice that whilst
Mr. Dean is not doubt serious in pursuing these proceedings,
there is no basis, on the documentation we have seen, to conclude that
Mr. Dean
has a good case against CIBC Oppenheimer or that the proposed proceedings will
produce a recovery of $1.7 to 2 million in
the foreseeable future.
<P>

Accordingly, the Bank is unable to accept, at present, your client's suggestion
that it takes an assignment of the proceeds of any
judgment in these
proceedings.  Nor is the Bank prepared to release funds in Mr. Dean's Bear
Steams account in order to finance the
pursuit of these proceedings.  However,
Mr. Dean of course remains free to pursue these proceedings, and the Bank
reserves all its
rights in relation to the proceeds of any judgment given in
Mr. Dean's favour.
<P>

As I indicated to you at our meeting, the Bank is concerned to ascertain the
whereabouts of all the funds it advanced to Nuchem
Australia Pty Limited and
which have subsequently been transferred away by Mr. Dean into his personal
accounts and/or to unknown
destinations.  You may be aware that these
facilities include the Letter of  Credit for AUS$4 million issued on 26th March
1998,
an overdraft facility in the sum of AUS$407,362.56, and US$ Letter of
Credit facilities in the sums of $393,320 and $483,000 issued
on 6th and 11th
March 1998 respectively, beneficiary Nuchem South East Asia Sdn Bhd.  The Bank
therefore invites Mr. Dean's realistic
proposals for repayment of all these
facilities.   Such proposals should be based on a detailed accounting of the
transfers and whereabouts
of all sums advanced to Nuchem by the Bank, and on a
detailed schedule of Mr. Dean's assets, wherever they may be.
<P>

I look forward to hearing from you with Mr. Dean's proposals on the basis
suggested above.  This letter is without prejudice to,
and fully reserves, any
and all rights of Standard Chartered Bank, Standard Chartered Bank Australia
Ltd, and Nuchem Australia Pty
Ltd (Receivers and Managers appointed) in this
matter."
<P>

44   	Feest evidenced the fact that since the date of that
facsimile the bank had heard nothing further from Billet "<i>either by
telephone or by writing"</i>.  It is difficult to reconcile that evidence with
Henaghan's evidence of his conversation with Billet on 25 April 1999.  Clearly,
the dilemma posed by that inconsistency may have been cured by direct evidence
from Billet.  
<P>

45   	There has been no evidence adduced through Billet and no
explanation offered by the applicant why Billet was not called in
this
application.  The applicant's problems do not end there, in my view.  Even on
the applicant's evidence there is no suggestion
of any continuing negotiations
after mid April 1999, so the question may be posed: what negotiations were
afoot such as to justify
any stand by the applicant that he need take no part
in the principal proceedings?  According to Feest, Billet informed the bank
that he had been exhorting the applicant to appear in those proceedings.  
<P>

46   	There is direct evidence of the applicant's receipt of the
bank's letter of 23 April 1999 in the form of a facsimile from
Billet to the
applicant of 9 August 1999.  The terms of that facsimile follow :
<P>

"In London meeting was held on April 15th 1999 with Charlotte Feest, Group
Legal Adviser for Standard Chartered Bank.  Also present
telephonicly was Mr.
Bill Bruce, Special Assesment (sic) Manager, SCB Singapore.  I enclose letter
from Ms Feest turning down my
proposal for settling this matter.  I believe you
have a copy of this letter.  If there is any other information I can provide
please
feel free to call me."
<P>

47   	There has been no explanation offered by the applicant for
the belated provision of the bank's letter to him, especially as
it came after
a time when, to the applicant's knowledge, the bank had gained judgment against
him in the principal proceedings. 
The applicant's evidence was that this
letter from the bank had been the subject of earlier discussions at a meeting
attended by
Billet, the applicant and  a New York attorney, Gary Silverman
(Silverman).  According to the applicant, when he was in New York
 "<i>in the
first half of June" </i> the bank's letter was discussed at such a meeting when
Silverman inquired about the state of negotiations with the bank.  
<P>

48   	There is something bizarre about that evidence when one
has regard to the contents of the bank's April letter.  Even more
bizarre is
the evidence of the applicant that he had not been made aware of the contents
of that letter earlier than June 1999 when
it is realised that Billet and the
applicant were together in Switzerland in May 1999 endeavouring to extricate
funds frozen by the
bank in the hands of Samsu Taha.
<P>

49   	I find it impossible to accept that, during that period,
if not earlier, the applicant was made well aware of the fact that
there were
no continuing negotiations with the bank and of the fact that the bank had
rejected Billet's without prejudice offer in
the bank's letter of 23 April
1999.
<P>

50   	It was the applicant's evidence that he had not been aware
of judgment being entered in the principal proceedings until a
conversation
with Henaghan in June 1999.  Henaghan wrote to the solicitors for the bank on
18 June 1999 in which he sought a copy
of the judgment in the principal
proceedings and made the following further observations:
<P>

"We still hold with us all the documents which were served upon us by you.  In
the event that Mr Dean ever contacts us in relation
to this matter we would
like to be in a position to bring to his attention service of the various
documents and of the Judgment entered
against him."
<P>

51   	I infer that it was after 18 June 1999 that the
conversation between Henaghan and the applicant took place in which the
applicant
was informed of the entry of the summary judgment.  Henaghan in his
affirmation made no mention of this conversation.  In his cross
examination he
said he gave this information to the applicant in "<i>mid to late June
probably." </i> Of that conversation Henaghan gave the further evidence.
<P>

"His Honour:  Q.  Could you please describe the conversation that you had with
Mr Dean in June this year when you informed him that
judgment had been
entered?
<P>

A.	Yes.  He contacted and when he spoke to me I said to him "There has been a
judgment entered in the Supreme Court in New South
Wales" and Mr Dean expressed
shock and surprise ---
<P>

Q.	Just please, try and remember that he said to you?
<P>

A.	He said, "Why would they do that?" And I responded, "I don't know, there
just has been judgment entered." I said to him I only
had a copy of the actual
extract, I think it is a couple of paragraphs, your Honour and so I couldn't
say any more about it.
<P>

Q.	But was that the end of the conversation?
<P>

A.	That was the end of the conversation and he indicated that he was going to
have to --
<P>

Q.	What did he say?
<P>

A.	He said that he would contact Gadens.
<P>

Q.	Was nothing said about the breach of the undertaking by Mr Billet, conveyed
by Mr Billet.
<P>

A.	Well, that was the shock that Mr Dean, when he said, "Why would they do
that?"  And in the context of the conversation, that
is whilst negotiations
were going on.
<P>

Q.	That is what I am trying to find out.  You said he said to you," Why would
they do that?" And you said, " I don't know ?"
<P>

A.	Mm.
<P>

Q.	Was nothing else said about the undertaking as conveyed to you by Mr
Billet?
<P>

A.	Well, it was the understanding that I had.  I never believed there was an
actual undertaking,  but whilst negotiations were going
on, it was common
ground that someone wouldn't go ahead and enter judgment.
<P>

Q.	I am just curious why there wasn't a discussion along those lines between
yourself and Mr Dean in this June conversation?
<P>

A.	Your Honour, I wasn't in an advisory role in relation to these proceedings
and Mr Dean said he would have to discuss that matter
with Gadens, because he
was trying to put forward a proposal and get that in order to."

52   	The conduct of the applicant from mid-June 1999 is not all
that critical standing alone. When placed in the context of his
conduct prior
to that, I think his post mid-June conduct takes on some significance.  The
applicant described that conduct in his
first affidavit as follows:
<P>

"I found out from Chris Henaghan in late June 1999 that judgment had occurred
in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.  Shortly
after that I spoke to Martin
Hirst, of Gadens, Lawyers, my then New South Wales solicitor, about the
judgment and he said to me that
he was coming to Malaysia in the next few days
and that we would discuss the matter then.  I made several attempts
subsequently to
contact Martin Hirst but Gadens did not know in which hotel Mr
Hirst was staying in Malaysia.  Shortly after I became concerned and
asked
Chris Henaghan to find me a new solicitor in New South Wales.  Henaghan McLean
had acted for me at various times and declined
to represent me after Nuchem
Australia went into receivership because of a conflict of interest.  In
addition, Henaghan McLean were
situated in Victoria, which was not suitable for
the proceedings in this State.  From the end of June 1999 until mid July 1999 I
was travelling between Malaysia and Indonesia on business.  On 19 July 1999
Chris Henaghan advised me that he had approached Hunt
Partners, solicitors of
Level 11, 139 Macquarie Street, Sydney.  On 20 July 1999 I instructed Henaghan
McLean to write to Hunt Partners.
 At that time, my file in this matter was
still situated with Gadens Lawyers.  On 27 July 1999 Hunt Partners received
from Gadens
my file.  On 5 August 1999 I instructed Hunt Partners to represent
me on this matter.   I did not see the Amended Summons of the
Plaintiffs until
receiving it from my then solicitors, Hunt Partners, in early September 1999.
My business commitments did not permit
me to return to Australia until 13
September 1999, on which date I had my first conference with my Counsel, Mr
Murray Aldridge and
my solicitors."
<P>

53   	I find the description of the applicant's conduct prior to
20 July 1999 as quite extraordinary in the context of a judgment
debtor for a
sum in excess of $5,000,000.  At best, I think that conduct can be described as
casual and I regard it as consistent
with the view I have formed as to what lay
behind the applicant's prolonged absence from Australia  from August 1998 and
his failure
to take any part in the principal proceedings prior to an
application to set aside the summary judgment.  
<P>

54   	I have been unable to accept the evidence of the applicant
as to his reasons for taking no part in the principal proceedings,
nor his
evidence of ignorance of the proceedings prior to April 1999, nor his evidence
that he was unaware of the bank's rejection
of Billet's offer of settlement
prior to June 1999 and take the view that the departure of the applicant from
Australia in August
1998 cannot be disassociated from the steps taken against
him by the bank amid the serious allegations raised against him in relation
to
the bank's investigation of the affairs of Nuchem Australia.  
<P>

55   	I take the view that the prolonged absence of the
applicant from Australia, along with his failure to provide any point of
contact other than the post office box address of Iqbal and his failure to
participate in the principal proceedings were part of
a deliberate course of
conduct by the applicant which form compelling reasons why this application
should fail and why the current
bankruptcy proceedings should not be impeded by
the setting aside of the summary judgment.  It is common ground that bankruptcy
proceedings
against the applicant are pending in the Federal Court.  The
applicant's evidence that he has an arguable defence to the bank's case
under
the guarantee is very much dependent upon an acceptance of his credibility.
The parties are agreed that the only relevant terms
of the facility and of the
charge, neither of which were in evidence before me, were those terms as set
out in the written submissions
of the applicant's counsel as follows:
<P>

"Clause 3.2 of [the Facility] which states
<P>

<i>"The customer undertakes to:</i>
<P>

<i>(a) give promptly to the bank any other information and supporting evidence
that the bank requests from time to time; ...."</i>
<P>

Clause 8.1.(1) of [the charge] which [imposed an obligation upon Nuchem
Australia] to:
<P>

"Give promptly to the [bank] the information and documents which the [bank]
requests from time to time in connection with:
<P>

(i) this deed; or 
<P>

(ii) the business, property or financial condition of [Nuchem Australia] or its
Subsidiaries; ..."
<P>

...
<P>

Clause 12.1(1) of the charge [provided for an event of default] if:
<P>

"A change occurs in circumstances which is warranted or taken to be warranted
under this charge to exist or in the business assets
or financial condition of
the Chargor, or of the chargor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, which in
any case in the reasonable
opinion of the Chargee may have a material adverse
effect upon the ability of the chargor to observe its obligations under this
Deed
or under an arrangement in connection with the Secured Money or on the
rights of the Chargee under this Charge or such an agreement;..."
<P>

Although it is not set out in the submissions it is common ground that a
further event of default under the charge was provided
for if:
<P>

a change takes place in the directors of Nuchem Australia without the bank's
consent.
<P>

56   	As to the act of default particularised in paragraph 29(a)
of the contentions:  the applicant evidenced a company search of
Nuchem
Australia which recorded that Moll ceased as a company director on 30 September
1997.  The applicant's evidence was that he
had a conversation on about 30 June
1997 in which Moll informed him that he was  "<i>going to resign</i>" his
directorship, but offered to continue to work with the applicant until he found
a suitable replacement as director.  The applicant's
evidence was that he left
to Moll the matter of lodgment of notification of his resignation as a director
with the Australian Securities
Commission and that it was not until some time
in April 1999 that he became aware of Moll's delay in doing so.  Moll was not
called
to give evidence in relation to that matter.  The evidence is quite
unsatisfactory and having regard to the views I have expressed
as to the
credibility of the applicant I would not be prepared to regard that evidence as
constituting the basis for an arguable
defence against the bank's case based on
the subject event of default.
<P>

57   	As to the default particularised in paragraph 29(b) of the
contentions:  I do not need to particularise the evidence relating
to it, other
than to observe that one of the failures to comply with requests made on behalf
of the bank was a failure to respond
to the investigating accountant's letter
of 10 August 1998 which required the applicant's comments "<i>prior to 4.00 pm
Tuesday 11 August 1998."</i>  I earlier referred to Moll's 21 August letter in
which he provided information to the bank and which included some material
relating
to the report of the investigating accountants to the bank, I would be
prepared to find that there is an arguable defence putting
in issue the act of
default so relied upon by the bank, notwithstanding the applicant's evidence,
quoted earlier in these reasons,
in which he admitted to a refusal to
co-operate with the investigating accountants in the face of their accusations
of fraud against
him.
<P>

58   	As to the default particularised in paragraph 29(c) of the
contentions:  the evidence relating to that act of default is largely
contained
in the report of the investigating accountant to the bank in August 1998.
Without doing too much injustice to the applicant's
case on this aspect, it is
his evidence  that:
<P>

1) the accounts upon which the investigating accountants acted were unreliable,
notwithstanding that they were accounts provided
by Nuchem Australia to the
investigating accountants for the purpose of the report to the bank, and 
<P>

2) that the net asset position of Nuchem Australia, as assessed by the
investigating accountants, had failed to take into account
certain assets, in
particular, the true value of the cable, the property of Nuchem Australia.  
<P>

59   	The applicant valued that cable, variously, up to
$(US)15,000,000, if one has regard to his sworn answer and counterclaim
in the
US proceedings,  or in excess of $8,000,000, if one limits consideration to the
applicant's evidence of valuations of that
cable which he said he caused to be
made.  No valuer was called and the evidence of  the applicant was less than
cogent.  
<P>

60   	The applicant challenged the investigating accountant's
estimate of $12,000 placed upon Nuchem Australia's cable.  In the
applicant's
first affidavit he gave the following evidence in chief:
<P>

"11. 	To the best of my present recollection and without the benefit of the
bulk of  the financial documents of Nuchem Australia,
I recall that at the time
of the receivership of Nuchem Australia, Nuchem Australia had approximately the
following quantities of
cable in stock.  Values shown below are obtained by
using the values for optical cable obtained from Belden Australia Pty Limited
specified above.
<P>

Cable Fibre	Approximate	Value AUD$
<P>

Size	Kilometre	
<P>

<u>	Length	</u>
<P>

144	115km	3,565,000
<P>

120	60km	1,560,000
<P>

96	10km	210,000
<P>

72	10km	160,000
<P>

48	240km	2,400,000
<P>

24	23km	138,000
<P>

			Total:      8,033,000
<P>

12. 	The stock specified in the above paragraph includes the optic cable
received by Nuchem Australia from Nuchem Multimedia."
<P>

61   	The reference to the cable of Nuchem Multimedia refers to
the cable said to be obtained through the letter of credit.  In
the applicant's
second affidavit he gave evidence of obtaining a valuation of Nuchem
Australia's cable in August of 1998 by causing
a sample to be provided for
valuation to a third party, Pacific Broadband Networks (Pacific), who responded
as follows:
<P>

"Please find herewith our price evaluation of a cable sample which was supplied
by Mr Gus Bodini of Belden Australia Pty Ltd.
<P>

In our opinion the cable sample would be used for broadband applications,
typically by companies such as Optus and Telstra.
<P>

Price Evaluation:
<P>

144 fibres	$30.00 per metre
<P>

120 fibres	$22.00-$25.00 per metre
<P>

48 fibres	$10.00-$15.00 per metre
<P>

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned."
<P>

62   	The applicant by extrapolating that value to <i>"cable on
hand as at 30 June, 1998 and subject to the letter of credit" </i>assessed the
value of Nuchem Australia's cable at $5,636,704.  That information was sent to
the bank in Moll's 21 August letter.
<P>

63   	The applicant also gave evidence in his second affidavit
of an inspection of some of Nuchem Australia's cable in September
1999 and
which he valued in excess of $1,000,000.  The applicant evidenced
correspondence of the receivers with customs agents in
December 1998, May and
September 1999 as disclosing the disposal of a quantity of cable for
approximately $40,000.  The applicant
asserts that these transactions are
inconsistent with the receiver's August 1998 report to the bank which
attributed a value of $12,000
to Nuchem Australia's cable.
<P>

64   	The applicant has not called a qualified valuer to support
his evidence of the true value of the cable of Nuchem Australia.
 So much of
the applicant's case on the application is largely dependent on an acceptance
of his credibility.  While I think that
it is fair to say that the bank,
through its solicitor, has not been over generous in assisting the applicant in
his efforts to establish
the value of Nuchem Australia's cable and while there
is evidence that the value of Nuchem Australia's cable exceeded the $12,000
estimated by the investigating accountants in their August 1998 report, I think
that the applicant's evidence of the valuation of
the cable is less than
cogent.  His evidence of value I think is at odds with his pursuit of business
opportunities on behalf of
Nuchem Australia over the last year or more, during
which he has been unable to dispose of one metre of Nuchem Australia's cable.
So much of his evidence of value which was dependent upon Pacific's valuation
of "a cable sample" provided by him, I found less than
convincing.
<P>

65   	It is not spelt out how the applicant's evidence of value
impinges on the bank having formed "<i>a reasonable opinion"</i> in 1998 that
there had been a change in the circumstances of Nuchem Australia which "<i>may
have [had] a material adverse effect upon the ability of [Nuchem Australia] to
observe its obligations" </i>under the charge or the facility: a finding
implicit in the reasons for summary judgment of Rolfe J.  It follows that I am
far from
satisfied that the applicant has evidence that he has an arguable
defence to the bank's cause of action against him under the guarantee,
principally due to the substantial dependence of such a case upon the
credibility of the applicant in this application.  Accordingly,
the application
is dismissed and the applicant is to pay the bank's costs of the application.

<P>

66   	I repeat an earlier observation in these reasons that, had
I reached a different conclusion, I would have required the parties
to further
address me on the question whether the applicant should be required to show an
arguable defence to the bank's case against
him on the fraud case, as it is my
present view, on the face of it, the application is defective for failing to
address that question.
