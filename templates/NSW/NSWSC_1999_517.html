Joseph Annania &amp; Anor </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>	</u></b>
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal by way of stated case from the judgment of a
magistrate in proceedings for breach of a contract
of sale of land.  The
appellants are a married couple, as are the respondents.  The respondents had
entered into a contract to purchase
a property at Cherrybrook from the
appellants and had paid a deposit.  The contract did not proceed to completion
and it was the
respondents who brought the action for breach of it.  They were
successful to the extent of recovering the deposit, together with
interest.
<P>

2	The contract was entered into on 28 November 1994.  At that time the house
was still under construction, but was about 90 per
cent complete.  The contract
was the standard 1992 edition, to which were attached twelve additional special
conditions.  The first
of those conditions provided that settlement was to take
place on 31 January 1995, time not being of the essence.   However, it went
on
to provide that, after that date, the appellants could forward a notice to
complete to the respondents requiring completion within
14 days from the date
of postage of that notice, in which event time would be of the essence.
<P>

3	The agreed price of the property was $500,000 and the respondents were
required to provide a deposit of five per cent of the purchase
price, amounting
to $25,000.  By special condition 2, that deposit was released to the
appellants upon exchange of contracts.
<P>

4	Special condition 10 provided that the appellants were to supply to the
respondents, prior to completion, an unqualified certificate
from Hornsby
Council under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/s172.html" class="autolink_findacts">s172</a> (since repealed) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</i> 1993</a>.
In negotiations prior to the exchange of contracts, the respondents had wished
to insert a defects liability condition which, among
other things, would have
required the appellants to remedy any defects in the building work before
completion.  The appellants did
not agree to such a condition.  However,
special condition 11 provided that the appellants should rectify at their own
expense any
"defects or other faults in the improvements on the property" of
which the respondents notified them within three months after completion.

<P>

5	On 25 January 1995 an architect retained by the respondents inspected the
building and was of the view that a number of matters,
of varying degrees of
significance, needed to be attended to before practical completion could be
achieved.  
<P>

6	On 30 January the respondents' solicitor wrote to the appellants' solicitor,
setting out the architect's list of matters for rectification.
 Of course,
completion did not take place on the date originally set for that purpose, 31
January.  What did happen on that day was
an inspection on behalf of Hornsby
Council, as a result of which a certificate under s172 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local
Government Act</a> </i>was issued to the appellants on 2 February.
<P>

7	On 1 February  the appellants' solicitor replied to the letter from the
respondents' solicitor, asserting that most of the matters
raised by the
architect did not amount to defects in title and suggesting a further
inspection of the site.  On the same day the
respondents were served with a
notice to complete in accordance with special condition 1, requiring settlement
on 17 February, time
being of the essence. 
<P>

8	On 2 February the respondents' solicitor wrote to the appellants' solicitor,
challenging the validity of the notice to complete
on the basis that the
appellants themselves were not "ready, willing and able" to do so.  They were
alleged to have been in breach
of their contractual obligations in a number of
respects.  Among other things, it was said they had failed to complete aspects
of
the building work for which specific provision was made in the special
conditions, and that they had not supplied the certificate
under s172 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a></i>.  The appellants' solicitor replied on 3 February,
maintaining that the appellants had met their obligations under the contract
and
that the s172 certificate would be supplied prior to completion.
<P>

9	An inspection of the property took place on 6 February, which was followed by
an exchange of correspondence between the solicitors
about the state of
completion of the work.  On 13 February the respondents' solicitor wrote to the
appellants' solicitor, stating
that the respondents treated the appellants'
refusal to undertake rectification work and complete the construction of the
house as
a repudiation of the contract and that a notice of termination would
be served.  On the same day the appellants' solicitor replied,
advising that
the respondents' actions would be treated as an anticipatory breach of the
contract and serving a notice of termination
on their part.
<P>

10	The learned magistrate found for the respondents upon the basis that the
appellants were in breach of the contract by their failure
to supply the s172
certificate by 31 January, the date originally set for completion.  Indeed, he
noted that they were in no position
to do so because the inspection for the
purpose of the issue of the certificate did not take place until that day.
Accordingly, it
was held, the appellants were not entitled to give notice to
complete, as they had done on 1 February.  His Worship referred to the
leading
New South Wales authority on this subject, <i>McNally v Waitzer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1
NSWLR 294</a> and, in particular, to a passage from the judgment of Hutley JA (at
304) which begins in this way: 
<P>

	The correct rule, in my opinion, is simply that a vendor who is in default in
respect of things which up until then should have
been done cannot give a
notice to complete, but he can give notice to complete prior to performing all
those other things which he
has to perform in order to complete the
contract.
<P>

11	For the same reason, his Worship held that the appellants were not entitled
to rescind the contract on the basis of anticipatory
breach by the respondents.
In <i>DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20138%20CLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 138 CLR 423</a>,
Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ said (at 433):
<P>

	A party in order to be entitled to rescind for anticipatory breach must at the
time of rescission himself be willing to perform
the contract on its proper
interpretation.  Otherwise he is not an innocent party, the common description
of a party entitled to
rescind for anticipatory breach...
<P>

12	These principles are not in doubt but, with respect, I consider that his
Worship fell into error in their application to the
case at hand.  Completion
by 31 January was not of the essence.  Indeed, from the respondents'
solicitor's letter of 30 January,
following the inspection by the architect
retained by them, it was clear that settlement would not take place on that
day.  What
special condition 10 required was the supply of a s172 certificate
prior to the day upon which completion actually took place.  In
the event, that
day was to be 17 February and the appellants were in a position to supply the
certificate before then.
<P>

13	Accordingly, to adopt the words of Hutley JA in the passage from <i>McNally
v Waitzer</i> quoted above, the appellants were not "in default" in respect of
anything which "then should have been done" at the time notice to
complete was
given. As that passage makes clear, they were entitled to give notice before
they had done everything which was required
of them prior to completion. 
<P>

14	The question remains whether the respondents were entitled to repudiate the
contract, as they did by their solicitor's letter
of 13 February, on the basis
that some building work was incomplete or required rectification.  His Worship
observed that standard
condition 7 of the contract provided a mechanism for
resolution of disputes between the parties, of which the respondents had not
availed themselves.  He noted that the respondents had been unsuccessful in
negotiating a clause requiring any defects in the building
work to be attended
to before completion, and that special condition 11 provided for the
rectification of defects within 3 months
after completion.  
<P>

15	There was no express provision in the contract about the standard of
workmanship or the quality of fittings.  His Worship considered
whether such a
provision might be implied.  He referred to standard condition 10 of the
contract which, among other things, provided
that the respondents could not
"make a claim, objection or requisition or rescind or terminate" the contract
in respect of "a promise,
representation or statement about this contract, the
property or the title, not set out or referred to in this contract...".  He
had
regard to evidence of the process of negotiation of the contract.  From his
reasons, I take it that his Worship found that a
provision that the building
work be completed in a proper and workmanlike manner prior to settlement should
not be implied.  Certainly,
he held that any such implied provision would not
be an essential term, breach of which would entitle the respondents to rescind
the contract: <i>DTR Nominees </i>(supra) at 430-1.
<P>

16	However, given that the decision turned on the fact that the appellants had
not supplied the s172 certificate, his Worship did
not have to determine
whether the respondents were entitled to rescind the contract because of the
state of the building work.  He
made no finding about the progress and quality
of that work.  It will be remembered that some of the matters complained of in
the
respondents' solicitor's letter of 2 February were the subject of special
conditions of the contract (see para 8 of these reasons).
 To decide whether
the respondents were entitled to rescind, it would be necessary to examine the
evidence of the defects alleged,
their significance, and the nature and extent
of the appellants' contractual duty in relation to them.  One matter which
might need
to be considered is whether special condition 11 was intended to be
confined to defects which became apparent only after settlement.
<P>

17	It follows that the matter must be remitted to the Local Court for
consideration in the light of the law as I have stated it.
 The questions
whether the appellants were in breach of any terms of the contract, express or
implied, and whether the respondents
were entitled to repudiate the contract,
remain open.
<P>

18	I shall consult counsel about the appropriate form of order and, if
necessary, hear argument on costs.
<P>
