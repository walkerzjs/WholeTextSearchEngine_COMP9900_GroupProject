<i>Tuesday, 9 March 1999.</i>
<P>

<b>4985/98	LORNA BONIEL  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>		CHARLES CAMILLERI &amp; 3 ORS</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>   By notice of motion filed on 26 February 1999, the
applicants (being Charles, Paul and Joseph Camilleri, the first, second and
third defendants) seek substantively an order that the proceedings continue on
pleadings. The plaintiff, Lorna Boniel, opposes that
relief. 
<P>

2	The substantive proceedings were instituted by the plaintiff on 14 December
1998 by the filing a summons.  That summons sought
substantive relief of the
nature appropriate to what is sometimes described as an oppression suit. The
relief sought in the summons
includes:
<P>

	1)	A declaration that the affairs of the fourth defendant, Camilleri Stock
Foods Pty Limited, are being conducted in a manner that
is oppressive and
unfairly prejudicial to and unfairly discriminatory against the plaintiff.
<P>

	2)	An order that the first, second and third defendants purchase the shares in
the fourth defendant held by the plaintiff 
<P>

	3) 	A reference to the Master for inquiry and report upon the value of the
shares in the fourth defendant at a certain specified
date. 
<P>

3	The plaintiff also sought alternative relief, including an order that the
fourth defendant be wound up.
<P>

4	The plaintiff in opposing the present application points to the fact that the
proceedings were required by Part 80(A) rule 3 of
the Supreme Court Rules to be
instituted by summons.
<P>

5	The fact that proceedings are required by the Rules to be instituted by
summons is not, of course, determinative of whether the
Court should exercise
the discretion given to it by Part 5 rule 11 of the Rules to order that the
proceedings continue on pleadings.
<P>

6	The purpose of pleadings is to delimit the issues between the parties so that
a defendant will know with precision and specificity
the nature of the cause of
action being asserted against it by the plaintiff.
<P>

7	In the instant case I have been taken on behalf of the plaintiff to two very
extensive affidavits together with a large binder
of exhibits to one of those
affidavits.  The exhibits alone comprise in excess of two hundred thirty pages.
One of the affidavits
consists of fifty pages and the other of twenty-nine
pages.
<P>

8	It will be appreciated that the summons merely seeks relief. The basis upon
which that relief is sought by the plaintiff must
be gleaned from the evidence.
My reading of the evidence to which the plaintiff has taken me in the  present
application clearly
indicates that there is a great deal of material concerning
various events (including alleged meetings of the fourth defendant and
conversations between the parties) upon which the plaintiff wishes to rely upon
in support of her claim for substantive relief. 
Nevertheless that material
does not of itself indicate with either precision or specificity the cause of
action upon which the plaintiff
seeks to rely.
<P>

9	The <i>Corporations Law </i>itself makes provision in two entirely separate
sections for relief of the nature sought in the present proceedings, which are
of
the kind to which I have already referred as being commonly described as an
oppression suit.
<P>

10	Section 246(AA) of the <i>Corporations Law </i>provides, in subsection (1)
thereof for an application to be made to the Court by a member of a company who
believes that the affairs
of the company are being conducted in a manner that
is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against a
member or members or in a manner that is contrary to the interests of the
members as a whole. It will be appreciated that prayer
1 of the summons
reflects the provisions of that subsection.  
<P>

11	Further, section 461 of the <i>Corporations Law </i>provides, in subsection
(1), various grounds upon which the Court may order the winding up of the
company. Those ground include the
grounds set forth in paragraphs (f), (g) and
(k) of that subsection. Some or all of those three grounds may well be able to
be relied
upon by the plaintiff in asserting her claim. 
<P>

12	It seems to me, however, that the very considerable bulk of the evidence of
itself is a sufficient indication that it is appropriate
in the circumstances
of this case that the matter should proceed on pleadings, so that the defendant
will know clearly the cause
of action upon which the plaintiff seeks to rely,
and that the plaintiff in due course will be aware of the nature of the
defences
which the defendants wish to raise in opposing the claim of the
plaintiff.
<P>

13	For those reasons therefore I propose to make an order that the proceedings
continue upon pleadings and to make consequential
orders.
<P>

14	I make the following orders:
<P>

	1) 	I make orders as sought in paragraphs 2 and 3 in the 	notice of motion
filed by the first, second and third 	defendants on
26 February 1999,
substituting in 	paragraph 3 the number "21" for the number "14".
<P>

	2) 	I order that the costs of the aforesaid notice of 	motion be the costs of
the aforesaid defendants in the 	proceedings.
<P>

	        The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
