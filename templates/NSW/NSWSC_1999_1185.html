<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  On the second day of the resumption of the
hearing of this trial on 16 November 1999 I gave a ruling ([1999] NSWSC
1120:
DLJT: 54) in connection with certain evidence then sought to be led from Mr
Lyall who was asked for his description of the
plaintiff's mood. The ruling was
to the effect that persons other than the plaintiff could give evidence in
relation to matters of
fact upon which experts, doctors in this case, relied in
forming their opinion.
<P>

2   	Since 16 November that ruling has been availed of in
relation to reputation witnesses, as I will call them, who are in a position
to
give evidence of their observations.  It was availed of by those witnesses
being asked directly as to their observations of the
plaintiff's mood and
demeanour before and after the relevant telecasts.  It can be observed that
that testimony was not used in any
way for the plaintiff in the further
elucidation of such expert evidence as was called by him from Dr Dent or Dr
Toohey.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff's sister presently is in the witness box.
Evidence is sought to be led from her of facts relating to the plaintiff's
family history and relationships, as identified especially at page 3 of Exhibit
H being Dr Toohey's report of 6 May 1997.  This area
has also been referred to
as set out in the "<i>abridged" </i>report of 18 May 1998 of Dr Dent (part of
Exhibit F) which that witness disavowed and in his "<i>unabridged" </i>report
Exhibit G of 18 May 1998.  The reports of Mr Woods, clinical psychologist,
Exhibit C contain material of like nature.
<P>

4   	With respect to Dr Dent and Dr Toohey, in the case of the
former with objection and in the case of the latter without, questions
were
asked to the effect:  are the statements of fact in your report true to your
knowledge and are the statements of the opinion
based on those facts opinions
that you hold? each receiving an affirmative answer.
<P>

5   	Notwithstanding what Mr Hall has said, I do not understand
the progress of the evidence in relation to either Dr Dent or Dr
Toohey to have
involved in any way a challenge to or an exploration of those statements in
relation to family history in each specialist's
reports with a view to
impugning any opinion each of them may ultimately have  arrived at.
<P>

6   	The trend of the cross-examination and what it presently
indicates as to the position of the defendant seems to me to be quite
clear.
On the issue of causation of any existing psychiatric condition, the critical
factors are what have been identified as "<i>stressors"</i> and whether or not
any found psychiatric condition is referable, in a causative sense, to the
programs sued upon (his treatment ending
in 1995) or in the case of Dr Toohey
the program sued upon, or other matters which were identified in the
cross-examination of Dr
Dent by reference to his extended report (Exhibit G)
and were identified in the cross-examination of Dr Toohey by reference to other
material related to other publicity and events commencing with, as I understand
it, the Grusovin statement in parliament.  There
is no apparent relevance
therefore to this proposed line of evidence evidence-in-chief.  If that is not
correct, insofar as there
has been an assertion of the correctness of the
statement of unchallenged facts, well, the material is there.  What part it
will
play in the wash up of the medical evidence remains to be seen. The
cross-examination which focused the issues however, did not in
my view
demonstrate that those matters which are sought to be led from Mrs Paling in
fact founded or constituted the basis for the
opinions of Dr Dent or Dr
Toohey.
<P>

7   	Its probative value, on the assumption that it is relevant
and admissible, therefore could only be considered to be at this
stage marginal
and the view fairly to be formed is that this would be a proper occasion for
the exercise of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135(c)</a> discretion, not based on unfair prejudice,
not based on misleading or confusing evidence given the probative weight of
what is sought
to be called but the resulting in undue waste of time.
<P>

8   	I propose to disallow the first component in Mrs Paling's
evidence.
<P>

9   	The second component is evidence sought to be led as to Mr
Marsden's reputation in his extended family.  Subject to the usual
ground work
being laid, that could hardly be the subject of complaint and I propose to
allow it.
<P>

10   	A third matter of evidence is this: evidence is going to
be called to seek to establish hurt caused to the plaintiff by the
impact of
the programs on the plaintiff's family, evidence from family members as to
observations of the plaintiff's reaction to
the defamatory publication is
admissible.  This however appears to go further than that.  It is evidence of
presumably the manifestation
of certain physical matters involving the
plaintiff brought about by what is said to be the impact of the telecasts on
other people.
<P>

11   	I do not presently propose to rule upon the admissibility
of that evidence.  The statement of the basis on which it is proposed
to be led
points to certain "<i>link"</i> questions, if not matters of general
principle.
<P>

12   	Mr Hall has indicated that either evidence will be sought
to be led of that kind from another witness or he will give due
notice of his
intention to lead it from this witness, Mrs Paling, when the occasion arises.
Its determination will thus apply in
either of those two events.
<P>
