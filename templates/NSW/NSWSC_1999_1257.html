COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 17 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>12070/1995</u>	<u>WILLIAM ROSTIER HARCOURT FREEMAN v ANI CORPORATION LIMITED
TRADING AS CAPITOL MOTORS</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff claims to have suffered personal injury in an
incident that took place on 5 September 1986.  The relevant limitation
period
expired in September 1992.
<P>

2  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons in 1995.  An
application was made for an order extending the limitation period.
 The
plaintiff relied on the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u> 1969</a>
(the Act).
<P>

3  	The application was heard by Master Greenwood.  He delivered
judgment on 29 September 1995.
<P>

4  	The Master was satisfied that the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> had been
met.  Also, he was satisfied that it was just and reasonable to make an order.
In reaching that decision, the Master took
into account matters of prejudice.
The terms of the judgment do not reveal that an order was in fact made
extending the limitation
period.
<P>

5  	The Master appears to have merely given the plaintiff leave to
file a Statement of Claim on or before 27 October 1995.  As the
effect of what
was done by the Master has not been the subject of argument I put that matter
aside.  No Statement of Claim was filed
in this Court, but proceedings were
commenced (ill advisedly) in the District Court on 23 October 1995.  In July
1996, the plaintiff
gave instructions to proceed with the action and his
solicitors were made aware of problems related to them.  The plaintiff
proceeded
with the action until the proceedings were summarily disposed of on
25 October 1996 (on the defendant's application).
<P>

6  	There was an appeal from the decision of the Master (it was filed
on 27 October 1995).  It did not come on for hearing until
16 December 1997.
The appeal was heard by McInerney J.  His Honour delivered judgment on 19
February 1998.  The judgment contained
certain observations on matters of
prejudice.  The appeal was dismissed with costs.
<P>

7  	On 9 December 1996, prior to the hearing of the appeal, the
plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion.  It sought an extension of time
for the
filing of a Statement of Claim.  It was made returnable on 17 December 1996.
It was stood over.  Ultimately, it came before
Master Greenwood on 19 March
1997.
<P>

8  	The transcript records that there was a hearing.  What happened
is not entirely clear.  The application for extension of time
may not have been
successful and this may have led the plaintiff to seek leave to file an Amended
Notice of Motion.  Leave was given
by the Master.  The transcript indicates
that the leave contemplated the filing of a Notice of Motion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> which
was to be dealt with at the time of the hearing of the appeal.
<P>

9  	On 25 March 1997, an Amended Summons was filed.  It sought an
order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G.</a>  Also, it sought an extension for the filing of the
Statement of Claim.
<P>

10  	On 12 May 1997, the plaintiff filed an Amended Notice of Motion.
It claimed relief similar to that sought in the Amended Summons.
 It was made
returnable on 3 July 1997.
<P>

11  	The parties appear to have acted on the basis that McInerney J
would also deal with another question (either the fresh application
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>
or an extension of time).  The judgment of his Honour did not deal with either
of the matters.  It may be that he saw the question
as a fresh application
which had become superfluous in the light of the determination of the
appeal.
<P>

12  	In April 1998, steps were taken to get the matter back before
McInerney J.  It was listed on 7 April 1998.  On that occasion,
the plaintiff
did not appear.  It was listed again on 7 May 1998, there was no appearance of
either party due to illness on the part
of counsel for the plaintiff.  His
Honour retired on 12 March 1999.
<P>

13  	Subsequently, his Honour was appointed as an Acting Judge.  In
August 1999, further steps were taken to bring the matter back
before McInerney
AJ.  On 6 August 1999, the matter came before McInerney AJ.  His Honour
determined that there was no part heard
application before him and referred the
Amended Summons to the Master's list for directions.
<P>

14  	In August 1999, steps were then taken to have the matter brought
before a Master.  On 24 August 1999, the plaintiff filed another
Notice of
Motion.  It claimed relief similar to that sought in the Amended Summons.  Yet
a further Notice of Motion was filed on
14 September 1999.  It claimed an
extension of time.  Ultimately, a fixture was given for a hearing to take place
on 14 December
1999.  It may have been given in respect of all of the various
processes before the court.
<P>

15  	There was a hearing on 14 December 1999.  The plaintiff relied
on three affidavits sworn by his solicitor (Mr Hagipantelis).
 The defendant
has relied on affidavits sworn by Robyn Maree Simpson (a solicitor) and William
Brown (a loss adjustor).  There was
no cross-examination.
<P>

16  	At the commencement of the hearing, some confusion ensued by
reason of the proliferation of process.  After some preliminary
skirmishing,
the plaintiff identified the Notice of Motion filed on 9 December 1996 and the
Amended Summons filed on 25 March 1997
as the only process upon which he was
moving.  Further, the plaintiff identified that he was seeking only an order
extending the
time fixed by the order of Master Greenwood.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff relies on the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 2</a> r 3 of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</u> 1970</a>.  This provision confers a discretionary power.
It is exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances of the particular
case
before the court and so that justice is best served between the parties.
The onus rests with the party seeking relief.
<P>

18  	The parties have referred the court to a number of decided cases
(including <u>Paino v Hofbauer</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=13%20NSWLR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">13 NSWLR 193</a>;  <u>Brisbane South Regional
Hospital v Taylor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">186 CLR 541</a> and <u>Gladesville RSL Club v Bartsch</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=44%20NSWLR%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">44
NSWLR 674).</a>
<P>

19  	In opposing the application, the defendant has agitated a number
of discretionary considerations (including delay, lack of
explanation for delay
and prejudice).
<P>

20  	I do not propose to embark on an exercise of exhaustively
reciting all of the relevant material.  Such as has been placed before
the
court may be found in the affidavits.  Although the plaintiff has relied on a
number of affidavits, the evidence falls short
of being satisfactory in a
number of respects.  The court can only act on the material placed before
it.
<P>

21  	The present application has become necessary because of default
on the part of the plaintiff.  He failed to take the opportunity
conferred by
the granting of leave on 29 September 1998.  The delay that ensued is
significant.  Not all of it is the fault of the
plaintiff and/or his legal
advisers.  However, it is his application and it was up to him to expeditiously
obtain relief.
<P>

22  	Generally speaking, there has been a lack of any sense of
urgency or expedition.  There seems to have been significant periods
of
inactivity.  Whilst proceedings were commenced prior to 27 October 1995, this
was the abortive and misconceived exercise involving
the filing of process in
the wrong court.  It remained on foot for about one year until it was disposed
of summarily on the defendant's
application.  This exercise may be seen in the
category of a self inflicted wound (see <u>Bartsch</u> at 68).  How it came
about has been largely left unexplained.
<P>

23  	The explanation proffered for both default and delay falls well
short of being satisfactory.  In some respects, no explanation
is offered at
all.  There was explanation which had to be derived by way of inference.  The
court has been informed, in general terms,
that it is accepted that there has
been negligence on the part of legal advisers.  On any view, the matter has
been handled with
a lack of competence and diligence.  The plaintiff himself
has not given evidence.  There is not much to suggest that he has been
putting
pressure on his legal advisers to act with competence and diligence.
<P>

24  	The judgments of Master Greenwood and McInerney J record the
suffering of prejudice.  More than four years have now passed
since the matter
was dealt with by Master Greenwood.  Whilst there is no evidence of additional
actual prejudice since that time,
the further delay can be expected to have
magnified at least some of the problems.  The magnification is of the
presumptive type
(see <u>Taylor</u>).
<P>

25  	If the matter were allowed to proceed to trial, it could be
expected that some years would elapse in the future before the
matter came on
for hearing.  The accident itself is now an event that took place more then 13
years ago.
<P>

26  	The plaintiff may well have a good cause of action against
certain of his legal advisers.  This matter was raised during submissions.
There is some conflicting authority on it.  Generally speaking, the authorities
make it clear that this is a matter which should
not be accorded great weight.
There is some authority to the effect that it is irrelevant.
<P>

27  	If the plaintiff is unsuccessful in this application, it would
seem that he may have lost the opportunity to prosecute his
claim for damages
(whatever the potential may be).  It would seem that his legal advisers see it
as a District Court claim.  His
prospects of obtaining a further order under s
60G would not seem good (see <u>Bartsch</u>).
<P>

28  	If the plaintiff is successful, the defendant will once again be
deprived of the benefit of the limitation defence despite
the default and
further delay on the part of the plaintiff.
<P>

29  	The court is left to make a decision on the material placed
before it.  I have already mentioned the deficiencies.  The plaintiff
is
seeking an indulgence in circumstances where inter alia his legal advisers have
created the problem and there has been a failure
to act promptly to rectify it.
The decision is not an easy one.  It has caused considerable deliberation.
<P>

30  	As I said, the plaintiff bears the onus of demonstrating an
entitlement to an order.  I am not satisfied that he has discharged
that onus.
I am not satisfied that the interests of justice would be best served by the
granting of the application.
<P>

31  	I dismiss the Notice of Motion and Amended Summons.  The
plaintiff is to pay the costs of the Notice of Motion and Amended
Summons.  The
exhibit may be returned.
<P>
