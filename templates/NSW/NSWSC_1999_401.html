<P>

<b>v   GREGORY MICHAEL FRANKS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Possession - whether there was an </b>
<P>

<b>agreement to defer mortgage repayments)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff seeks possession of the defendant's property
and the defendant opposes such an order being made.  He has filed an
amended
defence and cross claim.  The plaintiff relied on affidavits of Anthony John
Carroll sworn 26 August 1997 and 14 April 1999
and Lisa Anne Menin sworn 5
August 1998.  The defendant relied on his affidavits sworn 11 April 1997, 16
October 1997, 29 October
1997, 9 November 1997, 9 September 1998 and 14 April
1998.  Mr Carroll, Mrs Menin (formerly Links) and the defendant were cross
examined.
 The defendant represented himself at the hearing.  He was
intelligent, well prepared and articulate but at times his evidence and
submissions were confused.  I shall refer to his evidence in more detail later
in this judgment.
<P>

2	The defendant by his amended defence admitted paragraph (1) to (7) of the
statement of claim.  Hence, the agreed facts are that
the defendant is the
registered proprietor of the whole of the land in Certificate of Title Folio
Identifier 5/841832 known as 5
Hollydale Place Eden in the State of New South
Wales (the property).  On 9 December 1994 the defendant executed a registered
mortgage
in favour of the plaintiff.  The mortgage was executed in
consideration of a loan of $117,287 to be advanced by the plaintiff to
the
defendant.  The loan was progressively advanced to the defendant from 29
December 1994 to 7 June 1995 as the plaintiff built
a home on that block of
land.  The defendant's employment with the Roads and Traffic Authority was
terminated on 27 June 1995.  Notwithstanding
the loss of his employment the
defendant continued to make full mortgage repayments until January 1996.
<P>

3	Paragraph (6) of the defence specifically pleaded that in January 1996  the
defendant contacted an employee, servant or agent
of the plaintiff to advise
that he was in financial difficulty and would not be able to meet his January
instalment pursuant to the
mortgage.  Paragraph (7) pleads that in
consideration of the defendant's interest repayments pursuant to the mortgage
being capitalised,
the employee, servant or agent referred to in paragraph (6)
agreed to defer or alternatively vary the defendant's mortgage such that
the
defendant's repayment would be deferred until the outcome of the defendant's
unfair dismissal proceedings and workers compensation
proceedings whichever was
the latter.
<P>

4	In paragraphs (9) and (10) of the amended defence the defendant alleged that
in about April 1996 he contacted the plaintiff and
spoke to Ms Lisa Links and
that she similarly represented to the defendant "that the plaintiff would defer
the defendant's mortgage
repayments until the outcome of the defendant's unfair
dismissal proceedings and workers  compensation proceedings whichever were
the
latter" or alternatively in consideration of the defendant's payments pursuant
to the mortgage being capitalised then Ms Links
agreed to vary or defer the
defendant's repayment obligation as referred to above. 
<P>

5	In submissions the defendant stated that an employee of the bank told him
that he did not have to make mortgage repayments until
his legal proceedings
were finalised.  This offer was allegedly made at the bank's instigation in
January and the agreement was allegedly
extended in April and June 1996.  The
January representation is the first, the April is the second representation.
In the amended
defence of June 1996 which would have been the third
representation agreement is not pleaded.
<P>

6	The defendant alleged that these first and second representations were made
in trade and commerce and constituted representations
as to a matter within the
meaning of s 51A of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> and s 41 of the <b>Fair
Trading Act</b>.  The defendant further alleged that the first and second
representations were false in that the plaintiff has failed or refused
to defer
the defendant's further mortgage repayment until the outcome of his workers
compensation proceedings.  This failure constituted
misleading and deceptive
conduct within the meaning of s 52 of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> and s 42
of the <b>Fair Trading Act</b>.  While the defendant does not specifically deny
that he has been in default of making mortgage payments, it is accepted that
this
issue is in dispute.
<P>

7	The defendant has cross claimed and sought orders that the provisions of the
mortgage be varied in such a manner that the cross
defendant cannot seek to
enforce the provisions of the mortgage until the cross claimant's workers
compensation proceedings are determined
or alternatively that the cross
defendant be restrained from enforcing the provisions of the mortgage until the
determination of
the cross claimant's workers compensation proceedings or a
declaration that the notices issued by the cross defendant to the cross
claimant pursuant to s 7 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Home Finance Contracts) Act</a></b> 1984
and s 57 (2)(b) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b> 1900 are void and of no effect.

<P>

8	The issue to be decided is whether there was an agreement between the
plaintiff and defendant in January which was extended in
April and June 1996
and if there was such an agreement what were the terms of that agreement.  It
is necessary to consider in detail
the evidence of Mrs Menin and the defendant
together with notes in the bank file and the events which occurred around these
times
and in October 1996.  
<P>

9	Sometime prior to January 1996, the defendant had commenced two sets of legal
proceedings against his former employer one seeking
damages for unfair
dismissal and the other seeking workers compensation payments on the basis he
was suffering anxiety and stress.
 The records relating to the loan advance
account show that for the months of January, February, March and April 1996, a
counter
entry of $1,087 for repayment was deducted and then an entry was made
returning that amount to the account as being due and owing.
 The result is
that there were no mortgage repayments made by the defendant from January to
April 1996.  There have not been any
further mortgage repayments made since
January 1996, but the automatic deduction and reversal entries ceased to take
place after
April 1996 inclusive.  The defendant was charged $30 per month in
respect of these reverse entries between January and April 1996
(total $120.00)
on his cheque account.  The defendant's workers compensation proceedings were
finalised in August 1998 when they
were struck out and he lost his unfair
dismissal case in June 1997.
<P>

10	The defendant has no contemporaneous notes of his alleged conversations with
bank staff in January, April or June 1996.  He swore
3 affidavits which refer
to these conversations.  The first affidavit was prepared on 11 April 1997.
This affidavit was prepared
without the benefit of having had access to the
bank's file.  Prior to the preparation of the affidavits dated 16 October 1997
and
9 September 1998, the defendant had obtained the bank's file by way of
subpoena and he had read its contents.
<P>

<b><u>Purported January conversation</u></b>
<P>

11	The defendant's evidence is that in January 1996 he anticipated that his
workers compensation case would be heard in July 1996.
 There is a bank file
note dated 23 January 1996 by John Beazley who is a manager at the Bega branch
of the plaintiff's bank.  It
states in relation to this matter that the client
has approached that office to advise that he cannot make repayments.  He has
been
put off work by the Road and Traffic Authority (RTA) and a legal battle
has commenced to try and overrule the decision.  Income is
now unemployment
benefits of $375 per fortnight.  The bank requested the client's solicitor to
provide a summary of the current court
proceedings  to show a better picture.
The note concluded by seeking advice as to the further action required.
<P>

12	There is a letter on the plaintiff's file dated 12 January 1996 from the
defendant's solicitor confirming that the defendant
is currently appealing a
decision of the Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal.  It also
stated that the defendant was
experiencing severe financial difficulties and
that it is intended to apply to the Court of Appeal seeking an expedition of
the matter.
 It concluded by saying "please do not hesitate to contact us
further".
<P>

13	In the defendant's first affidavit of 11 April 1997 he makes reference to
conversations with bank officers in January and June
1996.  The April
conversation is not mentioned.  As previously stated the amended defence filed
on 23 October 1997 makes reference
to the January and April conversations.  The
contents of the affidavits and amended defence are not consistent.  The
original defence
makes no references to conversations but does refer to an
agreement being made at the plaintiff's instigation to defer payments pending
the outcome of his legal proceedings.  In the defendant's April affidavit, the
only statement that could refer to the purported January
conversation is
contained in paragraph (5).  This paragraph does not specifically refer to the
conversation occurring in January
1996 but states that when he became unable to
make his repayments he advised the bank, sought and was granted expedition of
his case
against the employer and moved out of the home so that it could be
rented in order to assist in making repayments.  The solicitor's
letter dated
12 January 1996 referred to an intended expedition application.  As at 12
January 1996 expedition had not been granted
nor had the plaintiff moved out of
the property and rented it out as this occurred in April 1996.  It is more
likely that in paragraph
(5) the defendant is referring to the purported April
conversation.
<P>

14	There is no reference in the second affidavit of 16 October 1997 (including
annexures) or the third affidavit of 9 September
1998 to a conversation
occurring in January 1996.  There is no letter on the bank's file other than
the solicitor's letter.  Neither
party asserts that the plaintiff wrote a
letter to the defendant in January 1996.  From Mr Beazley's file note it
appears that the
defendant did speak to an officer of the Bega branch of the
bank in January 1996 because the information recorded in the file note
is more
detailed than that contained in the solicitor's letter dated 12 January 1996.
The defendant cannot recall with whom he spoke
in January 1996, the date when
the conversation occurred nor has he ever given his version of what each person
actually said.  In
evidence the defendant stated that in January 1996 he said
to "them" that he was doing everything in his power to get the workers
compensation and other matters settled so he could return to work (t 44).  It
is not clear from the bank file note whether the defendant
spoke to Mr Beazley
or some one else employed by the bank whether the conversation occurred on 23
January 1996 or Mr Beazley wrote
the file note on 23 January 1996 referring to
an earlier conversation. The file note indicated that the plaintiff was
awaiting a
further letter from the defendant's solicitor.  It indicated that a
request had been made for the defendant's solicitor to furnish
a summary of
current court proceedings to show a better picture.  
<P>

15	There are two possible scenarios as to what actually occurred firstly, that
the solicitor's letter dated 12 January 1996 could
have been received after the
conversation between the defendant and a bank officer occurred or secondly once
the details of the letter
dated 12 January 1996 were received by the bank, then
the defendant had a conversation with an employee and that employee requested
a
further more detailed letter from the solicitor. The defendant points out that
no further information was requested from him. 
There is a reference in Ms
Wong's file note dated 14 October 1996 (which is referred to in more detail
later in this judgment) where
she said that there appears to be a letter sent
to the defendant's solicitor on about 15 February 1996.  A copy of this letter
is
not in evidence before the court.  If the latter scenario is what actually
occurred it would seem unlikely that an agreement had
been reached.  If an
agreement had been reached there would not be any necessity for further
information to be provided.  If further
information was requested, it would be
likely that the letter would refer to the agreement or intended agreement.
<P>

16	It is not necessary to determine in what order the telephone call and letter
occurred.  I accept that as the bank's file note
records that the plaintiff
advised the bank that firstly, that he could not afford to make repayments;
secondly he had been put off
work by the RTA and a legal battle had commenced
to override the decision and thirdly, he was on unemployment benefits of $375
per
fortnight.  There is no recorded discussion of any reduced amount that the
defendant could pay which one would expect to occur before
an agreement to
defer repayments was made.  There is no estimate of how long it would be before
the court proceedings were to be
finalised nor for what period the bank was
prepared to defer repayment.  There is no reference to the capitalisation of
interest
which presumably was to be of benefit to the bank.  
<P>

17	According to the defendant, the benefit to the bank in addition to the
capitalisation of interest was that by postponing repayments
it may receive the
arrears provided the plaintiff's legal proceedings were successful.  According
to the defendant in cross examination
the benefit to the bank was that it would
receive $30 for 4 months reversal entries which would take extra interest on
top of what
it was allowed to charge under the mortgage over the period of
deferral (t 46).  The defendant did not recall if he had mentioned
this in his
affidavits although he conceded that they were careful and complete and left
nothing important out (t 47).  At first
he stated that Ms Menin made mention of
this and then changed his answer to say it was part of the January
conversation.
<P>

18	There is no mention that the plaintiff offered to defer repayment which one
would expect if this offer was made at its instigation.
 In fact, there is no
mention of any agreement at all.  The evidence given by the defendant is at
odds with that contained in the
file note.  It is most unlikely that a bank
employee would offer to defer repayments without knowing the exact duration of
the deferral.
 Even if I accept that the defendant told an officer of the bank
that the workers compensation proceedings were probably going to
be listed in
July 1996 there were two sets of legal proceedings and the bank had not yet
been advised as to when the appeal in the
unfair dismissal proceedings was due
to be heard.  Had an agreement occurred, it is unlikely that the bank employee
would fail to
record it.  It could also be expected that the bank would confirm
such an agreement in writing.  This did not occur.  The defendant's
version of
events is, on the evidence improbable.  I prefer the plaintiff's version of
events and I am not satisfied on the balance
of probabilities that there was an
agreement between the plaintiff and defendant in January 1996 that in
consideration of the defendant's
interest repayment pursuant to the mortgage
being capitalised the plaintiff agreed to defer or alternatively vary the
defendant's
mortgage such that the defendant's repayments would be deferred
until the outcome of his unfair dismissal proceedings and workers
compensation
proceedings whichever was the latter.  I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that there was no agreement made
between the parties in January
1996.
<P>

19	As previously stated, no mortgage repayments were made between January and
April.  There is no activity on the bank file during
this period.  Both the
plaintiff and defendant submitted that this was consistent with their version
of events.  If interest was
meant to be capitalised, it would be expected that
the bank would have taken some steps to make these calculations and they would
appear in its records.  This was not done.
<P>

<b><u>Purported April conversation</u></b>
<P>

20	Ms Menin is employed by the plaintiff.  In April 1996 she held the position
of recoveries officer employed in the Home Loan Management
section of the bank
at Head Office in Sydney.  She swore an affidavit and was cross examined.  I
carefully observed her being cross
examined and I formed the opinion that she
was a reliable and truthful witness.  However there were two inconsistencies in
her evidence
which I shall refer to shortly.  Neither of these inconsistencies
led me to doubt her other evidence.  She has no independent recollection
of
speaking with the defendant at any time.  She spoke to up to 50 customers per
day so it is not surprising that she has no recall
of these conversations.
<P>

21	Ms Menin wrote a diary note dated 15 April 1996 which stated that she rang
the home number of the defendant and left a message
to call.  She wrote a note
to remind her to follow up if she had not received a telephone call from the
defendant on 22 April 1996.
 The next file note says that on 15 April 1996 "Mr
Franks rang while I was at lunch.  Rang home answering machine on."  Ms Links
gave evidence that after the defendant telephoned while she was at lunch she
would have returned his call.  He did not answer the
telephone so she left a
message on his answering machine for the defendant to call her because that is
her custom.  The next file
note is dated 22 April 1996 and says "Left message
to call."  However her evidence is she did not call the defendant on 22 April
1996.  This is at odds with her affidavit evidence which states that she did
call the defendant on 22 April 1996 but did not speak
to him so she left a
message for him to call.  On either of these versions, Ms Menin did not speak
to the defendant on 22 April 1996.
 She denies that she had a conversation with
the defendant in April 1996 and she denies that she ever made the statements
attributed
to her by the defendant.  There is another note which says "D -
24/4"  By this Ms Menin said she diarised that she should speak to
the
defendant on 24 April 1996.
<P>

22	However, the file note made by Ms Menin dated 23 April 1996 which appears
underneath the "D -24/4" entry indicates that she received
an application by
the defendant under the mortgage assistance scheme administered by the Home
Purchase Assistance Authority from
the Bega branch.  She completed the form and
posted it back to Bega.  Ms Menin, in this entry also recommended that as the
debt was
continuing to increase and she considered that there was no equity in
the house that the bank should issue a s 7 notice under <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Home Finance
Contracts) Act</a> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 7</a> notice).  Prior to issuing a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notice the bank's
practice was for the recovery officer usually to try to contact the borrower by
telephone and failing that use
written communication as a last resort.  No
letter was written to the defendant and he was not contacted prior to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a>
notice being first issued.  However the bank has no practice as to the number
of times it attempts to contact the borrower prior
to the issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a>
notice.
<P>

23	The next file note is in different hand writing and probably written by Paul
Dryden.  It stated that "Due to HLiC involvement
and poor equity position the
issuing a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notice is supported even though the Mortgage Assistance Scheme
application is still pending."  It is signed and a note underneath
appears and
states "We still haven't actually <u>spoken</u> to the borrower ?"  The last
entry on that page dated 21 May 1996 stated that the issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notice is
approved and signed by Claude Rydnen who was a bank manager.
<P>

24	The only reference the defendant made to a conversation with the bank that
may have occurred in April is in his affidavit sworn
11 April 1997 at paragraph
(6) where he says:
<P>

	<b>"6.	As soon as a suitable tenant was found in April 1996 I advised the Bank
to assertain (sic) whether they wanted the rental sent
straight to them from
the managing estate agents or simply deposited into my account from which the
repayments had previously been
deducted.  I was astonished (and grateful) when
the bank said they would defer repayments awaiting the out come of my legal
action
against my employer."</b>
<P>

25	This version implies that it was in April that the defendant was astonished
and grateful when the bank offered to defer repayments.
 It is unlikely the
defendant would have been astonished and grateful when, according to his
version of events the bank had already
agreed in January 1996 to the deferment
of mortgage repayments until the legal proceedings were completed.  It is my
view, that it
is more likely than not that Ms Menin did not have the
conversation alleged by the defendant in April 1996 for four reasons;  firstly,
it would be unlikely that she would volunteer to authorise the defendant to
defer making repayments, particularly as there is no
period stipulated;
secondly, the bank's diary notes do not refer to workers compensation hearing
being listed in July 1996;  thirdly
it is unlikely that she would have spoken
to the defendant and not taken any file notes as to the alleged agreement
bearing in mind
she did take notes in relation to other action she took in this
matter and fourthly, her action in authorising a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notice either immediately
after or days after agreeing that the defendant could defer mortgage repayments
is inconsistent conduct.
 
<P>

26	Further it is my view that Ms Menin would have appreciated the importance of
taking accurate diary notes as she spoke to up to
50 customers per day and
could not be expected to remember all of those conversations.  None of her
diary notes show that an agreement
was reached between herself on behalf of the
plaintiff and defendant that his mortgage repayments would be postponed until
his court
proceedings were finalised.  If she agreed to defer payments she
would have acted beyond her delegated authority and deceived her
superiors.  I
do not think that this is the case.  I accept and prefer Ms Menin's version of
events to that of the defendant.  Ms
Menin's course of conduct in April and
June 1996 is consistent with realising the bank's security. Finally, it is my
view that no
conversation took place between Ms Menin and the defendant in
April 1996.  This is confirmed by the file note probably written by
Paul Dryden
which comments that the bank had still not spoken to the defendant.
<P>

27	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was an
agreement or in April 1996 that in consideration of the
defendant's interest
repayments of the defendant's interest repayment pursuant to the mortgage being
capitalised the plaintiff agreed
to defer or alternatively vary the defendant's
mortgage such that the defendant's repayments would be deferred until the
outcome
of his unfair dismissal proceedings and workers compensation
proceedings whichever was the latter.  Nor do I accept that an agreement
was
made in January and the period of deferment was extended.
<P>

28	On 2 May 1996 it appears that Mr Leishman approved the issue of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a>
notice.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Home Finance Contracts) Act</a></b> notice is
dated 9 May 1996.  The notice advised the defendant that it intended to take
legal action or exercise its right under the
home finance contract after a
period of one month had elapsed.  It suggested that the defendant should
discuss the matter with the
credit provider and in particular Lisa Links (now
Menin) and gave details of Ms Menin's title and telephone number.  There is a
paragraph
contained in the letter which stated that if the defendant has been
unemployed, sick or there was another good reason why he could
not meet his
commitments then the contract may be varied under the law to meet his
situation.
<P>

<b><u>The June conversation</u></b>
<P>

29	On 7 June 1996 Justin Eamens prepared a file note.  Mr Eamens is also a
recoveries officer and a co-worker of Ms Menin at head
office.  It stated that
the court date for the workers compensation claim in relation to anxiety and
stress was 10 July 1997 but
that the defendant was still on sickness benefits.
It further stated that the property had been on the market for 12 months and
listed
at $163,000 and that the defendant was looking to return to the work
place as soon as possible (pending the court case).  It also
noted that the
defendant has already contacted Consumer Affairs and that they wanted to speak
to the bank to work out an arrangement.
 The defendant in his evidence does not
make any reference to a conversation between Mr Eamens and himself.  
<P>

30	It would be consistent for the defendant being aware that the time
stipulated in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notice dated 2 May 1996 was due to expire, to contact the
plaintiff either concerning his failure to make repayments, or drawing
the
alleged agreement with the bank to its attention and seeking an explanation as
to how this occurred.   There is nothing in the
file note of Mr Eamens to
suggest that there was an agreement in place.  Rather, it suggests that the
defendant was seeking more
time to forestall the bank from taking possession of
the property.  If an agreement had been struck, it would be inconsistent for
the defendant to seek the assistance of Consumer Affairs to work out an
arrangement with the bank.
<P>

31	Ms Menin agreed that she had a conversation with the defendant by telephone
on 11 June 1996.  Her file note bears the date 11
June 1996 and stated that the
defendant advised her that he was on sickness benefits for anxiety and stress
in the work place so
he could not afford to pay anything off the loan.  Her
file note recorded that she telephoned an employee of the Mortgage Assistance
Scheme and they informed her that it was still processing his application.  Ms
Menin says that she does not recall the conversation
with Mr Franks referred to
in her diary note as 11 June 1996.  However at that time it was her invariable
practice when talking to
a home loan borrower who was in arrears to say words
to the effect of: 
<P>

	<b>"You have a mortgage to the bank and we expect payment to be maintained.
The mortgage assistance scheme requires you to contribute
27% of your gross
income.  From past experience they decline applications unless you make
payments.  You have to make some payment
to show your commitment to your debt.
You cannot just not pay."</b>
<P>

32	In cross examination, Ms Menin clarified that she always treated each
application on its merits.  However, where a home loan
borrower who was in
arrears had made an application to the Home Purchasers Assistance Authority,
she always gave the above advice.
<P>

33	As previously stated, Ms Menin also says that in 1996 she had no authority
to agree to an arrangement on behalf of the bank for
the deferment of payment
of instalments due under the home loan mortgage.  The bank's practice required
in 1996 that any request
for deferment of such instalments be in writing from
the borrower.  Upon receipt of any such written request the bank's practice
required that she prepared a submission to her superiors for their
consideration.  
<P>

34	On 19 June 1996 the program officer of the Mortgage Assistance Scheme
declined the defendant's application and advised the bank
of this.  Included in
that letter was advice which was substantially in accordance with the advice Ms
Menin alleges that she previously
had given to the defendant.
<P>

35	In his affidavit dated 9 September 1998 defendant deposed to the June
conversation in the following manner.  He allegedly said:
<P>

	<b>"`I'm still on Sickness Benefits, but I do have good tenants in the house
&amp; the proceeds of the rent are still paid into my account
at the start of
each month by my real estate agents.  That will allow the bank to resume
deduction when they've decided they've waited
as long as they can.'"</b>
<P>

According to the defendant Ms Menin replied "Well, we don't usually allow
deferment of repayments, but I'm sure the bank won't be
prepared to wait until
July 1997 for your workers compensation case to begin".  On the defendant's own
version of events he records
that Ms Menin informed him that the bank will
<b>not</b> await the outcome of his legal proceedings.
<P>

36	In the affidavit of 16 October 1997, annexure A paragraph (2) the defendant
asserted that he did speak to Lisa Links in April
1996.  In this affidavit he
says at annexure 5(c) that "When Lisa returned my call on 11.6.96 she assured
me that the complete deferment
of (sic) acceptable as she didn't expect I could
afford the repayments while ill."  The defendant's two versions are
inconsistent.
 He conceded that none of Ms Menin's alleged statements were
confirmed by him with the bank in writing.
<P>

37	The defendant's version of the April 1996 conversation is not convincing.  I
accept that the defendant told Ms Menin that he
was on sickness benefits and
that he could not afford to pay anything off the loan and had applied to the
Mortgage Assistance Scheme.
 I also accept that Ms Menin may have had a
sympathetic telephone manner.  If the defendant had an earlier agreement with
Ms Menin
on behalf of the bank, as he had alleged occurred, why didn't he raise
it with her?  Why didn't he question her as to a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Home Finance
Contracts) Act</a></b> notice issued?  
<P>

38	It would be unlikely that Ms Menin had the conversation in June 1996 as
alleged by the defendant because, firstly, there is no
reference to any
agreement, any of the terms or the facts that realisation should be deferred ,
no mention of the court proceedings
or capitalisation of interest in her
contemporaneous file note;  secondly, her file note records that she gave
advice which was consistent
with the subsequent letter received from the
Mortgage Assistance Scheme and thirdly, she would have been acting outside her
authority
as there would have needed to be a written request and submission to
her superior on file.  The defendant's behaviour in seeking
the assistance from
Consumer Affairs would not have been necessary had there been an agreement in
place.
<P>

39	I find on the balance of probabilities that it is more likely than not, the
conversation that occurred between Ms Menin on behalf
of the plaintiff and
defendant is that deposed to by Ms Menin.  I am satisfied that there was no
agreement made in June 1996 that
in consideration of the defendant's interest
repayments being capitalised the plaintiff agreed to defer or alternatively
vary the
defendant's mortgage so that they would be deferred until the outcome
of his unfair dismissal proceedings and workers compensation
proceedings
whichever was the latter.
<P>

40	The subsequent file notes also support the plaintiff's contention that there
was no agreement between the parties.  In July 1996
D Ulutus, a collections
officer wrote a diary note.  This officer gave a history of the loan and
concluded that as the borrower was
unable to meet the monthly repayments and
the loan is "HLIC" insured, it is recommended that the bank proceed to
realisation.  A
supervising officer agreed with the recommendation that the
bank proceed to realisation and directed that a s 57(2)(b) notice be
issued and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notices to re-issue concurrently.
<P>

41	There are two relevant bank files notes and a subsequent letter from the
plaintiff written during October 1996.  There is a file
note by K Filer the
supervisor of home loans management dated 8 October 1996.  It stated that the
defendant telephoned and informed
her that the tenants in the property were
vacating in a fortnight and that the defendant was still on sickness benefits
and not looking
for work.  He was using rent to pay his own rent.  Ms Filer
advised the defendant that when the tenants vacated she would arrange
for the
locks changed as the bank had power of sale over the property.  There is also a
further note that his family was not in a
position to help the defendant and
that he could not afford any payments.
<P>

42	On 13 October 1996 there is a record by Ms C Wong, realisations officer.
She recorded that the defendant had telephoned and he
was upset at the way the
bank had handled his matter.  She has noted that the defendant was of the
opinion that the bank should have
written to him when the bank was prepared to
defer the action against him.  He said that had never received any letter from
the bank
until May 1996.  Ms Wong in her diary note agreed that the bank had
not sent any letters to him before the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cfca1984260/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> notice dated 9 May 1996.  She
advised him that if he wanted to he could send a letter to the bank which they
would have a look at.
 The defendant complained that Karen Filer did not tell
him that he had no other choice but to surrender the property to the bank.
 Ms
Wong confirmed that what Ms Filer had advised was true and she recommended that
action should not be deferred and that the matter
be followed up on 8 November
1996.  A note written at the foot of this file note agreed with Ms Wong's
recommendation and stated
that unless the proposal was realistic the bank would
be seeking possession at the expiry period of notice.  These file notes lack
any purported earlier references to any agreement or agreements by the
plaintiff to defer the defendant's mortgage repayments.  While
Ms Wong records
that the defendant told her that the bank should have written to him when it
was prepared to defer action against
him, the file note does not record the
defendant as saying that the bank at any stage had been prepared to defer
action or had made
any prior agreement or agreements with him for the deferral
of his mortgage repayments.
<P>

43	After the defendant spoke to Ms Wong he wrote a letter dated 14 October
1996.  He said:
<P>

	<b>"...I phoned Karen Filer who informed me the bank was going to take
possession of the property on 1.11.96 &amp; sell it.  She said
I would have to
move out &amp; hand in the keys.  I pointed out I had received the same notice
.. sent before dated 9.5.96.  Upon
receipt of that notice I had spoken to Lisa
Links who had been most sympathetic &amp; helpful when I explained my current
health,
employment &amp; financial position.  Under the circumstances she said
the bank would give me more time, that taking possession was
a last resort
which the bank did not like to do.  I was most relieved (&amp; surprised) by
the bank's compaassion. (sic).  I told
her the house was on the market &amp;
every effort to sell it was being made.  I had moved out &amp; rented it
out.</b>
<P>

<b>	I was most distressed to find the bank's attitude had changed when I spoke
to Karen Filer.  I have always understood the bank's legal
right to the
property.  In fact, in January when I was no longer able to meet the mortgage I
had expected no mercy from the bank
in exercising those rights.  I was wrong.
Although in hindsight it may have been better for all concerned if it had done
so before
interest began to accrue on the interest.  Unfortunately under what
terms &amp; for how long the current arrangement would apply
were never set out
in correspondence.  All the explanation I got from Ms Filer was that legal
action had commenced on 21.8.96 &amp;
the bank would not enter into any further
negotiation.  ..."</b>
<P>

44	In the balance of the letter the defendant spoke about his financial
situation and the fact that he had rented out his house
and that he asked the
bank to reconsider its position.  This is the first time that the defendant has
raised any purported agreement
he had with the plaintiff and refers to a
conversation with Ms Links that occurred after 9 May 1996.  The letter does not
give any
details as to the terms of the purported agreement and that he was
given mercy by the bank in January 1996.  It is my view that as
it became clear
to the defendant that the sale of his property had now become imminent, he
reconstructed the purported position of
the bank.  Prior to writing this
letter, his position was that the bank should have written to him when it was
prepared to defer
action.
<P>

45	Additionally, it is inconceivable that the plaintiff would enter into an
agreement stipulated by the defendant as it is uncertain.
 There is no benefit
to the bank but rather a positive detriment.  The equity in the property and
value of the property was decreasing.
 It was not certain that the defendant
would be successful with his claims and would obtain enough funds from them to
be able to
satisfy the debt owed to the plaintiff.  In the defendant's latter
version of the agreement given in evidence he stated that the
bank could
unilaterally terminate the agreement but did not do so.  Even taking into
consideration that the defendant is a litigant
who has not had the benefit of
legal representation, the defendant's version of events is confused, imprecise
and inconsistent. 
It is my view that the defendant's version of events has
been reconstructed, either consciously or unconsciously by the defendant
so as
to produce his desired result, namely that the plaintiff does not succeed in
taking possession of his property, despite the
fact that no mortgage repayments
have been made since January 1996.
<P>

46	If as the defendant later stated the bank had a unilateral right to
terminate the agreement at any time, it would have become
apparent that once
the plaintiff commenced legal proceedings that it had exercised its unilateral
right and terminated the purported
agreement.
<P>

47	I turn to the defendant's allegations of breaches of the <b>Trade Practices
Act</b> and the <b>Fair Trading Act</b> and the authorities cited by the
defendant.  I have read those authorities  Section 52 of the <b>Trade Practices
Act</b> is expressed in <b><u>Henjo Investment Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Collins
Marrickville Pty Ltd</u></b> (1988) ATPR 40-850 49,150-1, in general terms and

section:  see, for example, the <b><u>Hornsby Building Information

are cases where there will be deceptive conduct only where the intention
of the
alleged contravener is established.  Misleading or deceptive conduct generally
consists of representations, whether express
or by silence;  but it is
erroneous to approach s 52 on the assumption that its application is confined
exclusively to circumstances
which constitute some form of representation

<P>

48	In ascertaining whether the bank has engaged in conduct that is misleading
or deceptive or was likely to mislead or deceive,
it is necessary to examine
the conduct, whether representational in character or not and ask the question
whether the impugned conduct
of its nature constitutes misleading or deceptive
conduct.  This will often but not always, be the same question, as whether the
conduct is likely to mislead or deceive.  This misleading or deceptive conduct
caused the defendant to suffer damage.  The defendant
drew my attention to a
line of authority that says financial institutions have responsibility to
ensure sufficient explanations have
been given for a client to understand the
implications of an agreement or non-payment period has on the borrower.
<P>

49	The plaintiff sent s 7 notices to him in May and August 1996.  As I
understood the defendant's submissions in relation to the
<b>Trade Practices
Act</b> and <b>Fair Trading Act</b> because the plaintiff's 7 notices forwarded
to him in May and August 1996 stipulated that the mortgage may be varied due to
sickness
or unemployment there is an opportunity for the bank to negotiate a
deferral of repayments and the bank by not so doing, makes the
action taken by
the plaintiff null and void.  However, the letter makes it clear that the
plaintiff may negotiate a variation of
the mortgage but the obligation is not
mandatory.  The defendant's own evidence is that he did not make an offer to
pay a lesser
monthly sum or any sum at all in relation to the mortgage.  
<P>

50	The defendant also submitted that in January 1996 the plaintiff led him to
understand it would postpone repayments based on his
financial circumstances
and if it believed he had simply defaulted on his mortgage repayments in
February, March and April (t 89)
there was an obligation for the bank to speak
up.  According to the defendant, the silence of the bank and the internal lack
of follow-up
to the memo dated 23 January 1996 was consistent with his
understanding that the plaintiff would postpone repayments subject to the
hearing of his court cases which were anticipated to be heard around July of
that year.  I have examined the January conversation
in detail and I cannot
find any statements made on behalf of the plaintiff which led him to believe
that it was willing to postpone
repayments.
<P>

51	The defendant also complained that once legal proceedings were commenced he
was not given an opportunity to pay anything off
the debt and as a consequence
the debt has accrued to its current level.  In the defendant's last affidavit
at annexure A paragraph
(9)(b) he sets out between the months of May 1996 and
August 1997 the total deposits and the maximum balance that he had in his bank
account during that time.  In cross examination the defendant conceded that he
did not have the funds to enable him to pay the repayments
of $925 per month.
There is evidence that in October 1996 the defendant told Ms Filer that he
could not afford to make repayments
and that his family was not in a position
to help.  There is no evidence as to whether or not the plaintiff would accept
repayments
after the legal proceedings were commenced.  I cannot see how this
amounts to a breach of s 52 of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> or ss 41 and 42
of the <b>Fair Trading Act</b>.  
<P>

52	The defendant also raised in support of his claim pursuant s 52 of the
<b>Trade Practices Act</b> that the bank never told him that he was not
entitled to have tenants in the property to pay rent.  This is incorrect.
Aside from
para C1 of the mortgage, as at October 1996 the defendant advised
the plaintiff that he was using the rent to pay his own rent and
Ms Filer
advised the defendant that when the tenants vacated she would arrange for the
locks to be changed as the bank had power
of sale over the property.  
<P>

53	Finally the defendant submitted that as the bank fell silent because they
did not reply to his letter dated 14 October 1996 and
because there was no
correspondence from the bank to him prior to May 1996 that attempt to
unequivocally qualify the bank's position
constituted a breach of s 52 of the
<b>Trade Practices Act</b>.  Prior to the s 7 notice Ms Menin left messages for
the defendant to call but he chose not to follow that up.  Further I do not
think that the bank made any representations nor do I think that any of the
conduct by the bank amounted to misleading or deceptive
conduct pursuant to s
52 of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> or ss 41 and 42 of the <b>Fair Trading
Act</b>.  The lack of written correspondence prior to the issue of the s 7
notice and the bank's failure to notify him that it did not reconsider
its
position do not in my view constitute misleading and deceptive conduct.
<P>

54	In relation to the defendant cross claim, in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) the
defendant sought that the mortgage not be enforced
until the determination of
the workers compensation proceedings.  As previously stated on 8 August 1998
the defendant's workers compensation
proceedings were finalised on terms not
favourable to the plaintiff.  These orders sought by the plaintiff are no
longer applicable.
 The remaining order sought is that a declaration that the
notices issued by the plaintiff/cross defendant pursuant to s 7 of the
<b>Credit (Home Finance) Contract Act </b>1984 and s 57(2)(b) of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
<A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/">Property Act</a> </b>1900</A> are void and of no effect.  There is no evidence to
suggest these notices are void and this ground of the cross claim fails.  The
cross claim is dismissed.  The plaintiff is entitled to possession of the
property and I enter judgment accordingly.
<P>

55	In relation to the date when the writ of possession should issue there are
currently tenants in the property who have not been
notified that the property
is the subject of these possession proceedings.  The plaintiff notified the
occupiers of the premises
in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Part 40</a> r 11 of the <b>Supreme
Court Rules</b> (Ex B) but these tenants have since been replaced.  The new
tenants should be forthwith advised that the bank intends to take possession
in
14 days.  I grant leave to the plaintiff to issue a writ of possession, such
writ not to issue before 17 May 1999.   This period
should allow the current
tenants to move out in an orderly manner.  In relation to the monetary sum due
and owing, I accept the evidence
contained in the affidavits of Anthony
Carroll.  I calculate that the amount due and owing under the mortgage is
$161,754.94 due
as at 14 April 1999.  I do not have details of the amount of
interest that accrued between 14 April 1999 to the date of this judgment
so I
make no provision for this.
<P>

56	The judgment and orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	It is adjudged that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the whole of
the land in Certificate of Title Folio Identifier
5/841832 known as 5 Hollydale
Place Eden in the State of New South Wales.
<P>

(2)	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff the sum of $161,754.94.
<P>

(3)	The cross claim is dismissed.
<P>

(4)	Leave to issue a writ of possession, such writ not to issue before 17 May
1999.
<P>

(5)	The defendant/cross claimant is to pay the plaintiff/cross defendant's
costs of the proceedings including the cross claim.
