1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The plaintiff commenced an action in
the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 19 February 1999 against the defendant,
which is an entity
created by statute in South Australia.  The plaintiff, a
resident of New South Wales, suffered an accident whilst visiting South
Australia when she lost her footing whilst walking on an access ramp at Glenelg
Beach South.  The statement of claim alleges that
the defendant exercised
control over the access ramp and, during works in its vicinity, failed to
ensure that it was kept free of
loose surface material upon which, so it is
alleged, the plaintiff slipped.  The plaintiff claims that her fall caused a
fracture
of her left ankle and other injuries with painful and permanent
residual sequelae.  As a result of her disability, she has been unable
to
continue her pre-injury employment as a checkout operator at Coles or undertake
any similar activity.  Although it appears that
the plaintiff was immediately
conveyed to a medical centre in the Adelaide area, she did not receive
significant treatment since
her foot was extremely swollen and bruised and, on
the same day, she flew to Sydney for the purpose of receiving appropriate
medical
treatment.  Indeed, her general practitioner referred her to an
orthopaedic surgeon who operated on her at the St George Hospital
on 12 April
1996 and internally fixed her left ankle fracture.  Further medical treatment
and physiotherapy was provided to the plaintiff
in Sydney.  
<P>

2   	It will be seen from this brief outline that, to put it
somewhat crudely, the issues of liability concern what occurred in
South
Australia whilst the issues of damages arise out of what occurred in New South
Wales.  The defendant applies under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of</i> <i>Courts
(Cross-vesting) Act</i> 1987</a> (the Act) and pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> Rule 8(1) of the
<i>Supreme Court Rules</i> for an order setting aside service of the statement
of claim on the defendant, served in South Australia, on the grounds that the
Supreme Court of New South Wales is an inappropriate forum for the trial or in
the alternative, an order transferring the proceedings
to the Supreme Court of
South Australia.  The first of these orders was not pressed before me.  Rather,
the defendant submitted that,
in the circumstances of the case, s 5(2)(b)(iii)
of the Act applied, requiring "in the interests of justice that the relevant
proceeding
be determined by the Supreme Court of another State", namely South
Australia.
<P>

3   	The evidence indicates that, on the question of liability
it will be at least necessary for the plaintiff to adduce the evidence
of her
husband and her adult son who were with her at the time of the accident.  The
plaintiff resides in Sydney with her son whilst
her husband, currently working
in Melbourne, is to be reassigned to Sydney where he will be residing when this
action comes on for
hearing.  From the defendant's point of view, it appears
that it will call, if necessary, several employees.  It is said that an
expert
witness on each side is to be called although I am somewhat sceptical of the
utility of such evidence in light of the everyday
character of the case.  It
is, of course, uncertain as to the extent of medical evidence which it will
actually be necessary to adduce,
but it is indicated on the plaintiff's behalf
that, in addition to her general practitioner, she has been treated by an
orthopaedic
surgeon in Sydney and has consulted, for the purpose of her case,
two other orthopaedic specialists.  I have been informed that,
on the question
of the extent of her incapacity, in addition to her husband and son giving
evidence, it is expected that at least
two further lay witnesses would be
called.  It is likely also that one of the plaintiff's erstwhile co-workers may
be required to
give evidence as to the nature of her work, the likelihood of
its continuance and the extent of her incapacity.  As I understand
it, the
plaintiff has not yet been examined by any consultants on the defendant's
behalf so that it is obvious that these might be
either resident in Sydney or
Adelaide depending on the exigencies of the case.  
<P>

4   	The applicable law is, of course, that of South Australia,
but it does not seem to me that this is a significant consideration
having
regard to the relatively simple issues in the case.  
<P>

5   	The approach to applications of the present kind is rather
a "nuts and bolts" management decision as to which court, in pursuit
of the
interests of justice, is the more appropriate to hear and determine the
substantive dispute":  <i>Bankinvest AG v Seabrook</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 711</a> per
Street CJ at 714.  Apart from the specific matters required by s5(2)(b)(ii)(A)
and (B) whether it is more appropriate that the
relevant proceedings be
determined in South Australia in the interests of justice, will usually be
answered by selecting "the Court,
which, in all the circumstances, will
facilitate the course of litigation": <i>Crouch v Commissioner for Railways</i>
(Qld) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2063%20ALJR%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 63 ALJR 416</a> at 419, applied in <i>Seymour-Smith &amp; ors v
Electricity Trust of South Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20648" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 648</a> at 662.  In this
context, such observations that " . . . in the absence of special
circumstances, the litigation should be pursued
in the court in which it was
first commenced" (<i>Teserioro v Matstar Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2093%20ALR%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 93 ALR 607</a> at
608) and that where all else is equal, the case should not be transferred
(<i>Perpetual Holdings Pty Limited &amp; Ors v Leviathan Pty Limited &amp;
Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2030%20FCR%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 30 FCR 524</a> at 530) should be regarded as rules of thumb rather
than principles of law.  
<P>

6   	Whilst, as I have mentioned, it may be that a question as
to the application of South Australian law might arise, the applicant
has not
specified any particular matter under this head demonstrating a significant
difference with the position obtaining in New
South Wales.  It is difficult at
this early stage to enumerate with any precision the witnesses to be called on
each side but I have
the strong impression that the plaintiff will need to rely
on more than the defendant.  In this regard, it is material I think that
the
defendant has not yet appointed consulting medical specialists to examine the
plaintiff and thus that this can conveniently be
done in Sydney.  I have been
informed that the plaintiff's solicitors and present counsel have agreed to act
for her on a speculative
fee basis and that the plaintiff does not qualify for
a grant of legal aid.  It appears that the plaintiff and her husband have no
substantial savings.  The burden on the plaintiff of the cost of travel is
obviously greater than that for the defendant.  This might
have the effect of
inducing her not to call all relevant witnesses whose evidence is not strictly
necessary to establish her case.
 The burden of litigation for personal
litigants is very substantial and, I consider, is one of the considerations
that should be
weighed in deciding where the interests of justice lie.
<P>

7   	The applicant submitted that the plaintiff, claiming a sum
less than $750,000, was precluded by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s47</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act</i> 1973</a>
from hearing the matter through want of jurisdiction.  Accordingly, it was
submitted that it was unjust (together with all the other
matters relied on) to
subject the applicant to the additional costs of litigating in the Supreme
Court of New South Wales where,
the action could be heard in the District Court
of South Australia.  This argument is misconceived.  Firstly, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the Act
requires it to be more appropriate or otherwise in the interests of justice
"that the relevant proceeding be determined
by the Supreme Court of another
State" and, therefore, the fact that it might be better that the proceeding be
determined in another
court in that State is immaterial.  Moreover, although I
have not formed a concluded view about this, it seems to me that the
proceedings
may at all events be transferred to the District Court of New South
Wales under s143 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court</i> <i>Act</i> 1973</a>, the impediments
formerly contained within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s47</a> of that Act now having been removed.  Even if
this were not the case, however, the preponderant interests of justice in the
circumstances
here do not make it more appropriate that the litigation be
determined in South Australia, indeed to the contrary.  
<P>

8   	Accordingly, the motion is refused with costs.
