60411/94  60408/94<p>

COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL<p>
SMART J, ABADEE J, SIMPSON J<p>
<b>CATCHWORDS:</b>	ADMISSIBILITY OF HEARSAY EVIDENCE - REGARD HAD TO MATTERS
NOT IN EVIDENCE - PHOTO IDENTIFICATION - ACCOMPLICE CORROBORATION - UNSAFE
AND
UNSATISFACTORY VERDICT - SENTENCES<p>
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED:Reserved<p>
ALLOWED/DISMISSED:	Appeals against conviction dismissed.  Sentences reduced.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u><b>HEADNOTE</b><p>
<b></b><u></u><p>
<u><center></u>A group of men took part in the cultivation of a large cannabis
plantation in a remote and sparsely settled country area.  There was
identification evidence from two brothers (aged 17 and 15) who lived on the
family station and saw those involved at meetings and
inspections.  There was
ample opportunity for accurate observation.  The tapes of the telephone
conversations of the appellants provided
telling evidence against them.  The
explanations were not credible.<p>
<p>
<u>As To Both Appellants</u><p>
<u></u>Evidence was led of the appellants at a meeting at the station being
associated with a Ford utility.  There was a dispute as to its
colour.  The
utility was admitted into evidence, becoming an exhibit.  It was seen by the
jury on that day.  The judge stated that
the vehicle's relevance was its colour
and at that stage declined to permit the jury to inspect its interior when they
asked.  During
their deliberations the jury sent a message asking to see the
utility.  Arrangements were made for the utility to be brought to court
by the
son of the appellant Rizzotto.  The sheriff's officer verified with the judge
via his Associate that the jury could inspect
any part of the vehicle and
allowed the jury to do so.  The sheriff's officer spoke with Rizzotto Jnr on
returning the utility and
was questioned by Rizzotto's counsel during an
adjournment.  Rizzotto Jnr and the solicitor's clerk said that the sheriff's
officer
had in substance stated that the jury had had a good look over the
vehicle including under the hood which covered the tray.  The
sheriff's officer
could not recollect what he had said or precisely what the jury had done.<p>
<p>
<b>Held:</b>	(1)	The evidence as to what the sheriff's officer said to Mr
Rizzotto Jnr and 	counsel was admissible;<p>
<p>
	(2)	At least one of the jury probably looked inside the back of the utility;<p>
<p>
	(3)	Although there had been an irregularity, this could not have affected the
outcome of the trial.<p>
<p>
<u>As To Rizzotto</u><p>
<u>Identification</u>	-	The police showed the elder brother a series of 20
photographs.  They were a poor selection and included 6 photographs of the
appellant
Rizzotto.  Many of the other photographs were of people markedly
different from Rizzotto.<p>
<p>
<b>Held:</b>	The procedures adopted by the police were flawed and unfair.
However, the elder brother's extensive observations of Rizzotto enabled
him to
identify Rizzotto accurately and the evidence should have been admitted.<p>
<p>
The police showed the younger son the same photographs.  Nearly 7 weeks later
the younger son identified Rizzotto at an identification
parade.  In summing up
the judge pointed out the problems which arose and left the critical issue of
whether there had been a genuine
identification to the jury.  The younger son
had been able to make an extended and accurate observation of Rizzotto.<p>
<p>
<b>HELD:	</b>The evidence of identification of the younger son was correctly
admitted.<p>
<p>
<b>HELD </b><p>
<b>FURTHER:</b>	(1)	The judge had sufficiently isolated the deficiencies in the
identification 	evidence.<p>
	(2)	The judge had not erred in admitting into evidence certain tape recordings
of 	telephonic intercepts as evidence of common purpose.<p>
<p>
	(3)	The verdict against Rizzotto was not 	unsafe and unsatisfactory.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>As To Calabria</u><p>
<u></u>HELD:	(1)	The photographs of Calabria shown to the identification
witnesses were legitimately obtained - his wife permitting the police
to take
them;<p>
	(2)	The photographic identification was 	admissible and it was not unfair to
admit 	it;<p>
	(3)	The quality of the identification evidence was not poor and its probative
value was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect;<p>
	(4)	This was not a case where there should have been separate trials or where
there had been an injustice arising out of the joint
trial;<p>
	(5)	The judge had correctly left it to the jury to decide whether the 15 year
old brother was an accomplice and told the jury that
the Crown had to negative
that he was an accomplice.  It was not appropriate for the judge to direct the
jury that this brother was
an accomplice.  In any event, no prejudice or
miscarriage arose from the judge leaving the issue to the jury.  Further, the
jury
were directed that even if they were satisfied that the 	younger brother
was not an accomplice they 	should still scrutinise his
evidence most
carefully;<p>
	(6)	The directions as to corroboration were not weakened by the jury having to
decide whether the younger brother was an accomplice.
 The judge's directions
were adequate;<p>
	(7)	The verdict was not unsafe and unsatisfactory.<p>
<p>
Appeals against conviction dismissed.<p>
<p>
<u>Sentence Appeals</u><p>
<b>HELD:	</b>(1)	There was an element of disproportion between the sentences
imposed on the appellants and the co-offenders.  While the criminality
of the
appellants was high there was a co-offender whose criminality appears to have
been higher.<p>
<p>
	(2)	The sentences were excessive and should be 	reduced to a minimum term of 5
years and an additional term of 31/2 years.<p>
<p>
<b>ORDERS</b><p>
<b></center></b><p>
<center>1.	Each appeal against conviction is dismissed.<p>
<p>
2.	Leave to each appellant to appeal against sentence.<p>
<p>
3.	Each appeal against sentence is allowed.  In 	lieu of the sentences imposed
each appellant is sentenced to 81/2 years penal servitude
comprising a minimum
term of 5 years commencing on 14 July 1994 and ending on 13 July 1999 and an
additional term of 31/2 years commencing
on 14 	July 1999.<p>
</center><u></u><p>
<u><center></u><b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b></b><u></u><p>
<u></u><b>SMART J:</b>  The appellants appeal against their conviction that
between 1 October 1990 and 12 March 1991 at Cobar they knowingly took part in
the cultivation of a number of prohibited plants (about 3940 cannabis plants)
being not less than a commercial quantity.  They seek
leave to appeal against
the severity of the sentence imposed upon each, namely, a minimum term of 61/2
years and an additional term
of 31/2 years.<p>
<p>
In about October 1990 Kevin Parker met with Frank Barbaro, Russell Clark and
Joe Romeo in South Australia.  It was proposed that,
subject to suitability, a
cannabis crop be grown at Mt Grenfell, a large sheep station in a remote area
west of Cobar on which Parker
lived with his wife and children.<p>
<p>
A little later, Parker met with a group of men, including Barbaro and Romeo.  A
site for the growing of cannabis was selected.  The
Crown alleged that Antonio
Calabria was present as one of the investors.<p>
<p>
The site was ploughed and prepared for the sowing of seed.  Irrigation pipes
were installed and a number of men employed by or associated
with the investors
took up residence on the property to help cultivate the crop.<p>
<p>
About 10 December 1990, or perhaps earlier, a plane flew overhead.  This caused
the workers associated with the investors to leave.
 Kevin Parker became
alarmed.  He enlisted the help of his two sons (Jody and Hayden) and Les Holmes
who had worked for Parker until
December 1990.   Holmes' family still lived on
Mt Grenfell station and he came back each weekend.  The four men proceeded to
pull
up the poly piping and store it and other items about 500 metres from the
crop site.<p>
<p>
At a subsequent meeting attended by  Parker, his sons and a group of men (the
investors and their assistants) including the appellants
 Parker was told that
the crop was to continue and to re-lay the irrigation system.  The pipes were
re-laid, the cultivation continued
and the investors' workers returned to tend
the crop.<p>
<p>
Later in December, and probably between Christmas and New Year,  Parker, his
son Jody and Holmes pulled the pipes up again and loaded
them onto a trailer.
The cannabis plants had grown taller.  Barbaro protested by telephone,
insisting that the crop could not be
stopped.  A meeting was arranged at The
Pines (a hill with three pine trees about 40 kms out of Cobar).  It was
attended by the three
Parkers, some investors and assistants.  Parker believed
that the majority at the meeting accepted that the crop should be stopped
and
that he should destroy the plants.  The following day Barbaro telephoned and
said that the crop could not be stopped and that
if Parker did not agree to go
ahead with it Barbaro would telephone the police, tell them where the crop was
and Parker would be
caught with the lot of it.  Barbaro said that they were
coming back.  Parker told Barbaro that he did not want them back.  About
4 am
the following morning Barbaro, Ralph Esposito, Rocco Rizzotto and two or three
other people arrived at the Station.  Parker,
Jody Parker, Ralph, Rocco and a
man called Old Fred helped to re-lay the pipes.<p>
<p>
About 9 February 1991 Holmes reported the cultivation to the police.  He
continued to live at the property so that the police could
make enquiries and
identify and arrest all those involved.  Holmes was also asked to watch what
was going on and to report to the
police.<p>
<p>
Jody Parker stated that in about late February 1991 he saw a number of men
(including two men subsequently identified as the appellants)
and a pale blue
Ford XF utility parked outside a cabin used by the workers for the investors.
This was near the house occupied by
Holmes and his family.  Jody later
identified the utility from one police photograph.  <p>
<p>
On 11 March 1991 an appreciable number of policemen attended at Mt Grenfell
Station and made a number of arrests.  Police seized
3946 cannabis plants of
various heights and maturity and recovered a bag of harvested cannabis.<p>
<p>
Detective Clout stated that in late April 1991 he photographed a light blue
Ford utility PEJ 892 in which Tony Rizzotto (not the
appellant) arrived at a
service station owned by the appellant Antonio Rizzotto.  On 8 June 1994 the
Detective saw that utility next
to the Downing Centre Court complex.  The
vehicle was being driven by the appellant Rizzotto.  The detective saw him
alight from
the vehicle and walk to the Court complex.  He described the colour
of the utility which he had seen near the Court complex as pale
blue.<p>
<p>
On 27 April 1991 the home of Antonio Rizzotto at Smithfield was searched.  In a
record of interview made that day he denied involvement
in the crop but
admitted that he had owned the utility PEJ 892 for about 21/2 years.  He
allowed his wife and children to drive the
utility but never lent this utility
to other people.  His nephew, Rocco, who was on an extended visit to Australia
had used the utility
on a short local trip to a club near the appellant
Rizzotto's home.  Rocco had never borrowed the vehicle over-night.  The
appellant
said that he had driven the utility to Griffith a number of times but
not elsewhere in the country.  Rizzotto denied that he had
ever been to Cobar
or Mt Grenfell Station or to meetings about a cannabis plantation.  He
travelled to Dubbo once to see Rocco when
he went to court.<p>
<p>
He knew an Antonio Calabria from Griffith.  He agreed that some of the tapes of
intercepted telephone calls were conversations between
himself and Calabria,
the co-accused.<p>
<p>
On 30 April 1991 Hayden Parker identified the appellant Rizzotto in an
identification parade.  Kevin Parker did not.<p>
<p>
The home of the appellant, Calabria, at Hanwood, near Griffith was also
searched on 27 April 1991.  The police took possession of
some guns.  To the
police at his home he denied that he had ever been to Cobar or near Cobar.  He
said that he had not spoken to
anyone named Rizzotto in Sydney for a long time.
Sgt Dolan stated that he held numerous conversations with Calabria and that he
spoke
at length with his family in the Italian language.  These conversations
enabled the officer to identify Calabria's voice on some
tapes of telephone
calls.<p>
<p>
After the search Calabria went to the police station.  Constable Cahill stated
that at about 11.50 am on 27 April 1991 Calabria was
charged and allowed to go
home.  This was probably in relation to some gun offences.  On 9 May 1991 the
police interviewed the members
of the Parker family.  Jody Parker identified
Calabria from some 10 photographs.  Hayden Parker identified Calabria from some
12
photographs.  On 10 May 1991 Kevin Parker was tentative, using the word
"possibly".  It was decided to charge Calabria.  Later that
day Calabria was
arrested and charged as to the plantation.  Calabria declined to be
interviewed.  The police gave evidence that
Calabria's solicitor indicated by
implication, that Calabria would not take part in an identification parade.
This was challenged.
 Calabria denied that he had been asked to take part in
such a parade.<p>
<p>
Calabria and Rizzotto had known each other for about 25 years.  Rizzotto had
spoken to Calabria about his nephew, Rocco, who was
visiting from Italy,
fearing that the nephew may become involved in illegal conduct.<p>
<p>
The Crown relied upon intercepted telephone conversations in the Calabrian
dialect at the trial.  There were conversations between
Rocco and Rizzotto (and
members of his family) some of which were guarded and some of which used
euphemisms such as, "the broccoli
have flowered".  It was apparent that Rocco
was working in a dry hot area and working hard physically.<p>
<p>
Within a day or so of Rocco's arrest the Dubbo Police telephoned Rizzotto and
advised that Rocco had been locked up for the crop
at Cobar.  When Rocco spoke
to Rizzotto the latter asked Rocco if he alone had been arrested.  On being
told no, Rizzotto said that
he understood.<p>
<p>
Shortly after this, in a telephone conversation between Rizzotto, Calabria and
a third person Rizzotto stated, "They got the shepherds"
and that he had to go
to Dubbo the following morning.  There were further telephone conversations
between Rizzotto and Calabria in
guarded terms with elliptical references.
There is a reference to a "big boss" and a "little boss" and of a trip to
Melbourne, probably
for the purpose of Rizzotto seeing one of the heads of the
operation and to them (probably the police) not getting a particular man
who
had gone into hiding.<p>
<p>
Calabria denied taking part in the cultivation of cannabis plants.  He denied
that he had ever visited Cobar or the plantation or
worn a towelling hat.  He
said that he conducted a farm at Hanwood on which grapes, oranges and prunes
were grown.  He was assisted
by his wife, three sons and a daughter.  He
supplied grapes to Rizzotto and they had discussed his collecting them.<p>
<p>
Calabria said that he had spoken to Rizzotto about his nephew, Rocco.  He knew
Rocco was involved in something illegal but he did
not know what it was.
Rizzotto had referred to his nephew lacking brains.<p>
<p>
The interpreter stated that in recounting what Rizzotto had said to Calabria,
the latter had used two dialectal words.  Their literal
meaning was "they
caught the shepherd".  An idiomatic meaning may have been intended.  Calabria
said that he meant "stupid, his nephew
might be get caught"(T804).  The literal
meaning was, however, singularly apt.  Rizzotto called the barrister "big boss"
and the
solicitor "little boss".<p>
<p>
Calabria denied that the taped telephone conversations related to the cannabis
crop.<p>
<p>
Character evidence was given by several witnesses.  They attested to him being
a hard worker, a good family man and trustworthy.
 He enjoyed a good reputation
in the Griffith district.<p>
<p>
An interpreter, Mr Molinara, advanced different meanings of some parts of the
tapes.  He tended to be less literal and more idiomatic.
 In some instances it
was not easy to determine which meaning was intended and understood.  I doubt
if the differences were significant
overall.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto denied any involvement in growing marijuana.  In a very short dock
statement he said that he had never met the Parker family
and that he had never
been to Cobar except when he attended the court there.  His nephew had stated
that he was involved.  Rizzotto
was very concerned so he telephoned his friend
Calabria.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto believed that in talking about broccoli his nephew was trying to tell
him not to worry because, "he was nearly over".  A
credible meaning was that
the crop was nearly ready.  Rizzotto stated that when the police telephoned he
was very upset.  He telephoned
Calabria and told him, "the idiot, Pecorari been
caught".  Rizzotto continued, "The big boss is Mr Bellanto.  The little boss is
Mr Whitby".<p>
<p>
Idiot was one of the colloquial meanings of 'pecorari' advanced by Mr
Molinara.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto did not refer to the utility in his dock statement.<p>
<p>
<u>The Crown's Approach To Proof</u><p>
A great deal of time was spent at the trial on the identification evidence of
Jody and Hayden.  The appellants sought to demolish
it or to persuade the jury
that it could not be relied upon or that at least there was a reasonable doubt
as to it.<p>
<p>
From the conduct of the trial and the summing up it was clear to all that the
Crown, apart from the identification evidence of the
three Parkers, relied on
the other circumstantial evidence as proving beyond reasonable doubt the
involvement and guilt of Rizzotto
and Calabria.  The Crown relied on there
being a large plantation of cannabis being sown and grown, the visits of groups
of people
(the investors) and representatives or employees of the investors
working on the plantation.  Those matters were convincingly established.
 The
question was not whether there was a cultivation of cannabis plants but whether
the appellants took part in it.<p>
<p>
The explanations of what the appellants had said were not credible.  The
contents of the tapes pointed to their knowledge of what
was happening and
their involvement.  Further Rizzotto and Calabria had lied and the lies
included their recent contact and their
relationship.  The explanation given of
the sale of grapes by Calabria to Rizzotto was less than convincing.<p>
<p>
Without the identification evidence of Jody and Hayden the Crown case was not
as strong.  Some reasonable juries may not have regarded
the Crown evidence as
sufficiently strong without it.  Others may have taken a different view.  Part
of that identification evidence
included Jody associating Calabria and Rizzotto
with the light blue Ford utility at the plantation.  The Crown contended that
the
identification evidence of Jody and Hayden Parker as to both appellants was
cogent.  Parker could not identify Rizzotto and his identification
of Calabria
was tentative and insufficient.<p>
<p>
The appellants at the trial and on appeal insisted that without the
identification evidence no conviction could be supported and
that the
identification evidence was so deficient that it did not advance the Crown case
against either of them.<p>
<p>
<u>Impermissible Use By Jury Of Utility</u><p>
Both appellants complained that the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to
have access to the tray of the utility while considering
their verdicts when he
had previously limited examination to observation of the external colour of the
utility.<p>
<p>
The utility was not a critical piece of evidence at the trial but it was a fact
relevant to a fact in issue.  While it was capable
of corroborating the
evidence of Jody in one respect, it was subject to limitations.<p>
<p>
Hayden gave no evidence as to the utility.  At the trial Jody stated that in
about mid February 1991 he went to the log cabin on
his motor bike.  There were
people inside talking.  He did not go in immediately but stayed outside.  He
took particular notice of
a light blue Ford utility saying, "It was an XF ford
ute, it had a black torno (Tarpo) cover on it, it had a roo bar and ... little
square Navarra spotlights" (T252).<p>
<p>
Jody said that when he went into the log cabin he saw amongst others, Old Frank
(Calabria) and the person he identified outside Dubbo
Court (Rizzotto).  They
drove from the log cabin to the new shearing shed and stopped.  Jody did not
see them put the Honda fire
fighter and pump in the back of the utility but the
next day the pump was gone.  Ralph said to him that they had taken it.  He
identified
the utility as that shown in Ex26 being a photo of parts of 3
vehicles taken outside Dubbo Court House.  About the front and 1/2
of the
utility's body were visible.  That vehicle bore the number plate PEJ 892.  Jody
said that Old Frank was driving in the utility
(T253).  As to the man at Dubbo
Court House (Rizzotto) Jody said he definitely saw him at the log cabin but he
may not have seen
him in the utility (T262).<p>
<p>
The important point was that the appellants were together at the log cabin.
They were there in connection with the plantation.  The
utility was of lesser
importance although it was owned by Rizzotto and helped to provide a further
connection between the appellants.<p>
<p>
Jody's evidence had a history.  About 13 March 1991 Jody told the police during
their investigations that he had seen a blue Ford
utility at the plantation
(probably at the log cabin).  At the trial he remembered the first letters of
the registration number but
he had not included those in a statement. (T263)<p>
On 10 April 1991 Jody described the utility to Det Beaufils as a light blue
Ford ute driven by the older Frank.  Jody may have stated
that the colour was
light blue earlier.  Det Beaufils showed Jody Parker a photograph of three
vehicles.  The middle vehicle was
Ford utility PEJ 892.  It had a bull (or roo)
bar and spotlights.  Jody had recognised these.  He remembered the square shape
of
the spotlights with the yellow sticker on them and seeing the vehicle at the
homestead (T722).<p>
<p>
Thereafter Jody described the vehicle by reference to these characteristics and
the number.  He told Det Beaufils that the inside
of the tray was scratched
when he looked into it and that it had a black tarpaulin over the top of the
tray. (T722)<p>
<p>
There is nothing unusual about scratches on the tray of the utility.  With any
utility which has been regularly used for a year or
more it would be surprising
if there were no scratches.<p>
<p>
Both Jody and Det Beaufils acknowledged that Ford utilities were common and
that there must be many blue Ford utilities in Australia.
 It was not uncommon
for utilities to have roo bars and spotlights.  Ford utility PEJ 892 was
described by other witnesses as being
white or off white.  It was registered as
being white in colour.<p>
It was seen by the jury under artificial and in natural light.  The photograph
of the utility taken at Dubbo Court in March 1991
and that taken on 27 April
1991 in the south western suburbs have different hues.<p>
<p>
Det Beaufils stated that when he saw the vehicle on 27 April 1991 it was light
blue.  A photograph (ex 28) of the vehicle (and another
vehicle) taken on that
day showed that the vehicle was light blue in colour.<p>
<p>
The evidence of Jody Parker was subject to much challenge.  Part of the
challenge was based on the colour of the car.  The jury were
told that if they
were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Jody Parker sighted the light blue
Ford utility at the Station that
could be used as corroboration as it was not
disputed that the appellant, Rizzotto, owned it (SU 197).  At T871, immediately
after
Rizzotto made his unsworn statement, his counsel tendered "car PEJ 892".
It was admitted without objection and marked Exhibit R5.
 The judge placed no
restriction on the use to which it could be put.  The judge told the jury that
he would have the vehicle brought
down into the basement of the Downing Centre
so that they could see it under artificial light, that then they could see it
up at
the Darlinghurst Court complex in the natural light and that the vehicle
would be available for them to look at up until the trial
concluded.<p>
<p>
In the absence of the jury the judge stated that at the completion of the view
he proposed to release the vehicle as it was Mr Rizzotto's
means of
transport.<p>
<p>
The judge, the parties and their legal representatives adjourned and reconvened
in the basement car park.  The utility was placed
in a position approved by all
parties.  The judge returned to Court and instructed the jury that they were to
be accompanied by two
officers to the car park so that all of them could have
"a good look at the vehicle".  The officers were not there to answer questions.
(T873)<p>
<p>
The judge told the jury that after lunch the court would take some brief
evidence and that the jury would then proceed to Darlinghurst
to view the
vehicle in daylight.<p>
<p>
After lunch the judge stated (T874):<p>
<p>
	"I had a request from the jury to look inside the car and under the bonnet.  I
didn't allow that request.  It seems to me that the
issue here is the external
appearance of the vehicle, nothing else, nothing more.  Does everyone agree
with that?"<p>
<p>
The transcript records "Counsel indicated they did".<p>
<p>
An experienced photographer gave evidence as to how a white car can look blue
and vice versa.  It may be due to the colour mix when
the negative is being
developed or to slight under exposure when the photograph is being taken.<p>
<p>
The judge told the jury that the exhibits would be made available for them to
look at prior to counsel addressing so that they would
be familiar with them.
The judge continued (T880):<p>
<p>
	"I did receive a request from you to look at the interior of the vehicle and
under the hood of the vehicle.  As I understand it,
the evidence in this case
relates to the external appearance of that car.  I do not think there is any
need to look under the hood
or interior.  That is the only observation I want
to make at this stage.  If there is a reason that you want to do something by
all
means write me a note and let me know and I will discuss it with counsel
and we will come to an answer in regard to that matter.<p>
<p>
	I will make arrangements for a bus to transport you to an area where you can
view this vehicle in daylight and that will be done
as soon as possible.  After
you have seen the vehicle to your satisfaction you will then be brought back.
You can indicate to the
officers that you have satisfied your every need and
you will be brought back to the jury room.  You can continue looking at the
exhibits if you want to or you can disperse, it is entirely a matter for you.
Then tomorrow morning you can continue looking at all
the exhibits and take as
long as you like to look at them.  The motor vehicle will be available to you
at any time if you want another
look at it, it certainly can be arranged to
look at in the area where you viewed it earlier today quite easily."<p>
<p>
The transcript continues "(view of exhibit R5)".<p>
<p>
During the Summing Up (SU 325 &amp; elsewhere) the judge referred to the
dispute as to the colour of the vehicle.  He mentioned that
some of the
photographs showed it as white and some as blue or light blue.  The judge left
it to the jury to say whether it was a
vehicle which could be perceived as
blue.  The judge reminded the jury that the defence contended that the vehicle
was a white one
and provided no support for the evidence of Jody Parker that he
saw the utility at the Station.  Jody said that the utility he saw
was blue or
light blue.  The judge reminded the jury that the appellant contended that Jody
Parker was wrong about the vehicle and
wrong when he said that Rizzotto and
Calabria were at the station.  The judge referred in detail to the arguments of
the Crown and
those of Rizzotto, Calabria and Prochilo (a co-accused) about the
colour of the utility and whether it was at Mt Grenfell Station
as alleged by
Jody Parker.<p>
<p>
After the appellants had been convicted and during the sentence proceedings on
the following day (14 July 1994) counsel for Rizzotto
referred to the utility
being delivered to the court on the previous day by Rizzotto Jnr for inspection
by the jury and the son being
asked by the Sheriff's Officer to check the
vehicle as the jury had asked to see the back of the utility which was covered.
Counsel
expressed the fear that the jury may have looked to see whether the
inside of the tray was scratched.  Three years had elapsed since
the incident.
The judge responded:<p>
<p>
	"What a jury does with an exhibit is for it to determine and how your client's
son got that information I do not know.  He should
never have got it.  Anyhow
they did it, what do you want?"<p>
<p>
<p>
This exchange occurred<p>
<p>
<p>
	"BELLANTO:  Your Honour's clear indication, as I understood it, was the
purpose of the tender and the only way the jury could use
the tender was to
determine the colour of the vehicle from outside, looking at the vehicle from
the outside.<p>
<p>
	HIS HONOUR:  That is not my understanding, once an exhibit is tendered, it is
tendered.  The car was locked and a specific request
was made to look in it and
having discussed that with counsel I did not allow it..."<p>
<p>
The judge refused Counsel's request to cross examine the sheriff's officer and
to determine the facts.  Counsel enquired of the judge
whether he had received
a request from the jury.  The judge refused to discuss that matter or what the
jury did or did not do.<p>
<p>
Mr B.J.Ahern, a law clerk, instructing Counsel for Rizzotto, has sworn that
during their deliberations the jury informed the Court
that they wished to view
the ford utility (Ex R5) owned by Rizzotto and that the trial judge informed
counsel and those instructing
them of this request and, in the absence of
objection from counsel indicated that with the co-operation of Rizzotto's son
and a sheriff's
officer he proposed to permit the jury to view the exhibit (the
utility) within the precincts of the court.<p>
<p>
Mr Ahern has further sworn "that counsel raised no objection to the jury
request provided that the judge's previous direction that
the vehicle remain
locked and secured be adhered to".  If this be correct it would be odd for the
judge to cause the sheriff's officer
to be told by his Associate that the jury
could look anywhere they wished on the vehicle. <p>
<p>
The transcript records that the jury retired on 12 July 1994 to consider their
verdict.  An absent juror who had met with an accident
the previous night was
discharged.  The transcript of 13 July 1994 shows that this caused some delay
and that the jury retired again
at 10.43 am on 13 July 1994 and that the jury
returned with their verdicts at 3.55 pm that day.  The transcript which this
Court
has makes no reference to the jury's request or the arrangements made.
Perhaps the matter was dealt with in Chambers.  If it was
dealt with in Court
perhaps there was no short-hand writer or sound operator or nobody thought that
it was necessary to record some
minor administrative arrangements.<p>
<p>
The appellant's son, Tony, brought the utility back to the Court complex for
the jury to look at it again.  This was probably on
13 July 1994.<p>
<p>
Mr R.A.Brown, a sheriff's officer at the trial, remembered that a vehicle was
involved and thought that there were a number of views
of the vehicle,
including an inspection during the course of the jury's deliberations about mid
morning.  It was Mr Brown's recollection
that the Court had not re-convened
when the jury's request to inspect the utility was received.<p>
<p>
Mr Brown said that prior to the view he asked the judge's associate whether the
jury could look anywhere they wished.  She went to
the judge.  Upon her return
she said that the jury could look wherever they wished.  Mr Brown said that he
was inexperienced.  It
was his first long trial.  He wanted to make sure that
he knew what was to happen when he went down to the utility.  He did not
remember
a request from the jury to look in the back tray.  He did not think
that a request from the jury had led him to speak to the judge's
associate but
he could not be sure about this.<p>
<p>
Mr Brown said that by arrangement, the appellant's son drove the vehicle to the
top of the ramp and handed it over to the sheriff.
 The vehicle was checked and
driven down into the basement.  The jury were brought down to view it.  Mr
Brown was present.  He believed
the vehicle was a utility and that when it was
brought down there was a cover over the back of the tray.  Mr Brown had a vague
recollection
of the view.  He was unable to say whether the jury or any juror
looked under the cover.  He could not recall looking under the cover
himself.<p>
<p>
Mr Brown could not recall whether the jury's viewing of the vehicle was to be
done in circumstances where the vehicle was to remain
locked.<p>
<p>
After the jury's verdict Mr Rizzotto Jnr was given permission to collect his
father's vehicle.  It was driven to the top of the ramp.
 Mr Brown asked Mr
Rizzotto Jnr to check the vehicle before he drove away to ensure that it was
safe and that everything was secure.
 Mr Brown could not recall his exact
words.  He did not recall telling Mr Rizzotto Jnr to "have a look in the back
to make sure everything
is as it was because the jury had a look".<p>
<p>
Mr Rizzotto Jnr said that after 4.00 pm on 13 July 1994 the sheriff's officer
said, "When you pick up the vehicle have a look in
the back to make sure
everything is as it was because the Jury had a look".<p>
<p>
Mr Ahern said that about 11.15 am on 14 July 1994 during the morning tea
adjournment Mr Bellanto spoke with the sheriff's officer.
 Obviously, Mr
Bellanto had received information from Messrs Ahern and Rizzotto Jnr and
desired to confirm what had happened.  Mr
Ahern swore that the sheriff's
officer, probably in response to Mr Bellanto, informed him that after the jury
had completed their
inspection of the vehicle on Wednesday 13 July 1994 he
requested Mr Rizzotto Jnr to inspect the loading tray of the vehicle because
the jury requested access to it during their inspection.<p>
<p>
Mr Ahern swore that Mr Bellanto replied that he understood that the jury was
not permitted to look into the vehicle and that the
officer responded, "I
checked it with his Honour first - I spoke to his Honour's Associate who said
she would check it with his Honour
and then she said it was okay".<p>
<p>
At the hearing before this court the Crown objected to the admissibility of the
evidence of Messrs Ahern and Rizzotto Jnr so far
as they purported to relate
what Mr Brown had said.  It also objected to the narration in summary form that
Counsel raised no objections
to the jury's request.<p>
<p>
The Crown contended that the evidence of Messrs Ahern and Rizzotto Jnr was
hearsay.  Even if it were not technically hearsay it was
only evidence that Mr
Brown had made statements in the terms alleged.  This material did not
constitute evidence of the truth of
the facts.  It was not evidence that the
jury had looked under the cover and into the tray nor that the jury had had
regard to any
scratches or drawn any conclusions.<p>
<p>
In the ordinary course the evidence of Mr Brown as the officer in charge would
have been determinative of what the jury had or had
not done.  His recollection
was far from complete.  When counsel sought to investigate the matter when it
was fresh in everyone's
mind the judge refused to allow counsel to pursue the
matter, probably for three reasons.  The judge had remarked "Anyhow they did
it."  This suggests that he was aware that the jury had looked under the cover
of the utility at the tray.  Second, he regarded the
jury's deliberations and
what they did with an exhibit during those deliberations as sacrosanct.  Third,
once an exhibit was tendered
the jury could look all over the exhibit in the
absence of some limitation.<p>
<p>
While there is always room for error I would find it difficult not to accept
that the sheriff's officer had uttered the substance
of the remarks attributed
to him by Mr Ahern.  Mr Bellanto QC was present at and probably conducted the
interview with Mr Brown.
 He took the matter up with the judge at an early
point of time.  He pressed the conversation upon us.<p>
<p>
The Court admitted the evidence to which objections had been taken and stated
that it would give its reasons later.  The Crown did
not lead any evidence in
reply or seek to cross examine either Mr Ahern or Mr Rizzotto Jnr.<p>
<p>
As Lord Wilberforce observed in <u>Ratten v. The Queen</u> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1971/1971_23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] UKPC 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1972%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1972 AC 378</a> at 387 a
question of hearsay only arises when the words spoken are relied on
'testimonially', ie, as establishing some fact narrated
by the words.  That
situation is to be distinguished from the case where the speaking of the words
is itself relevant.<p>
<p>
In <u>Walton v. The Queen</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=166%20CLR%20283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">166 CLR 283</a> at 288 Mason CJ said:<p>
<p>
	"The hearsay rule applies only to out-of-court statements tendered for the
purpose of directly proving that the facts are as asserted
in the statement.
Generally speaking, evidence of out-of-court statements relied on for another
purpose is not excluded by the rule.
 Thus, evidence of a relevant out-of-court
statement is admissible evidence of the maker's knowledge or state of mind when
he made
the statement in a case where such knowledge or state of mind is a fact
in issue or a fact relevant to a fact in issue ..."<p>
<p>
and<p>
	<p>
<p>
	"Evidence of the making of the statement may be given by the author himself
or, in the case of an oral statement, by any person
who heard it made."<p>
<p>
Evidence of the officer's knowledge of the extent of the jury's inspection, he
being either the only officer or possibly one of two
officers apart from the
jury who knew what happened, would be a fact relevant to a fact in issue.
There is no doubt that the jury
inspected the utility during their
deliberations.  The question is whether the jury inspected the back tray under
the cover.  We
are dealing with a declaration of extremely recent past
memory.<p>
<p>
In <u>Ratten</u> at 389 Lord Wilberforce, delivering the advice of the Judicial
Committee, said:<p>
<p>
	"The possibility of concoction, or fabrication, where it exists, is on the
other hand an entirely valid reason for exclusion, and
is probably the real
test which judges in fact apply.  In their Lordships' opinion this should be
recognized and applied directly
as the relevant test: the test should be not
the uncertain one whether the making of the statement was in some sense part of
the
event or transaction.   ... As regards statements made after the event it
must be for the judge, by preliminary ruling, to satisfy
himself that the
statement was so clearly made in circumstances of spontaneity or involvement in
the event that the possibility of
concoction can be disregarded.  Conversely,
if he considers that the statement was made by way of narrative of a detached
prior event
so that the speaker was so disengaged from it as to be able to
construct or adapt his account, he should exclude it."<p>
<p>
His Lordship continued at 391:<p>
<p>
	"... there is ample support for the principle that hearsay evidence may be
admitted if the statement providing it is made in such
conditions (always being
those of approximate but not exact contemporaneity) of involvement or pressure
as to exclude the possibility
of concoction or distortion to the advantage of
the maker or the disadvantage of the accused."<p>
<p>
The sheriff's officer had no reason to concoct what he said to Mr Tony
Rizzotto.  It was a natural comment flowing from what he had
recently seen and
in an area where he had responsibility.  The officer also had no reason to
concoct what he said to Mr Bellanto
but that statement was made a day later.
The officer appears to have given a straight forward reply to the enquiry
addressed to him
while the case was still pending.  He had checked with the
judge via his associate and had no reason to feel apprehensive.  The extreme
unlikelihood of concoction on the part of the sheriff's officer is a factor
favouring the admission of the statements made by the
officer.  There was
probably time on both occasions for concoction but no reason for concoction by
the officer.  Mr Rizzotto Jnr
had reason to concoct a story.  However, he was
available to be examined and cross examined in Court.  It was a pity that the
officer's
recollection had faded.<p>
<p>
A further approach would be to treat the officer's statements as part of the
circumstances to be taken into account: <u>Walton v. The Queen</u> at 303 and
305.  It becomes a question of what inference should be drawn from the whole of
the circumstances including the statements.<p>
<p>
In <u>The Queen v. Benz &amp; Anor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=168%20CLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">168 CLR 110</a> Mason CJ at 118 and Deane J
at 121 alluded to the need for re-examination of the hearsay rule and the
recognition in some judgments
in <u>Walton</u> of the need for greater
flexibility in the application of the hearsay rule.  The question was not
argued in that case.  At 143 Gaudron
and McHugh JJ stated that there was much
to be said for the view that the rationale of the exceptions to the rule which
prohibits
the admission of hearsay evidence is that evidence falling within the
exceptions has a high degree of reliability and can be acted
upon safely.
Their Honours continued at 144:<p>
<p>
	"If this is the rationale of the exceptions to the hearsay rule then
notwithstanding the decision in <u>Myers v. DPP</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1965%20AC%201001" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1965 AC 1001</a>, a strong case
can be made for developing and applying the common law rules of evidence by
reference to the principle that hearsay
evidence will be admitted when it
appears to have a high degree of reliability."<p>
<p>
Their Honours saw that as a principle of admissibility constituting a general
exception to the hearsay rule.  It is a stimulating
approach.<p>
<p>
In <u>Pollitt v. The Queen</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=174%20CLR%20558" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">174 CLR 558</a> the Crown case was that, pursuant to
a financial arrangement with Dennis Allen (the instigator), Pollitt was to
murder a nominated
man but made a mistake as to that man's identity and
murdered the victim instead.  Mrs Berry said that later on the morning of the
newsflash about the shooting she and Mr Berry were visiting Allen.  Allen
described the shooting as one of mistaken identity.  Later
that day or perhaps
early the next morning the Berrys' were present when Allen received a telephone
call during which he became angry
and said to the caller, "You get the rest of
the money when you do the job properly".  A little later Allen told the Berrys'
that
he had been speaking to "Ray" and that "he had given him a job to do and
he had stuffed it up".  Allen also said, "I have already
given him 5000, he
expects me to give him another five for something he hasn't done".  Mrs Berry
knew Pollitt as Ray.<p>
<p>
The Court held that what was said by the instigator (Allen) in the telephone
conversation was admissible, that Mrs Berry's evidence
of the instigator's
statement that he had been speaking to the accused was admissible and that the
wife's evidence as to each of
the instigator's statements that he had given the
accused money and he had 'stuffed it up' and that he had already given the
accused
$5000 and that he wanted another $5000 for something he hadn't done,
was inadmissible.<p>
<p>
As 565 Mason CJ remarked that there were statements in <u>Walton</u> which
supported a less than rigid application of the hearsay rule.  Mason CJ at 566
thought that the case for relaxing the hearsay
rule should prevail.  Brennan J
discussed the question of the admissibility of hearsay evidence at some length.
At 577-8 he stated
that subject to the exceptions to the hearsay rule,
"...evidence of an out-of-court statement tendered to prove the truth of some
fact asserted by the maker of the statement, expressly or impliedly, is prima
facie inadmissible.  But where the making of a statement
in particular terms is
capable, in conjunction with evidence of other facts and considered in the
light of common experience, of
founding an inference that a relevant fact
exists, evidence of the making of the statement is admissible as original
evidence of
the relevant fact".  That is the position in the present case.<p>
<p>
At 582 Brennan J noted the views of Deane J in <u>Walton</u>.  Brennan J
regarded <u>Walton</u> as a decision governing the admissibility of hearsay
evidence under the res gestae exception and one which should continue to do
so.<p>
<p>
At 594 Deane J pointed out that the general rule against the admissibility of
hearsay statements was a judge made rule which was
clearly subject to
exceptions or qualifications.  His Honour agreed with these observations of
Lord Pearce, dissenting, in <u>Myers</u> at 1034:<p>
<p>
	"My Lords, the evidence whose admission is the ground of complaint was fair,
clear, reliable and sensible.  The question is whether
the court was bound by a
technical rule to exclude it.  No one doubts that the general exclusion of
hearsay evidence, subject to
exceptions permitted where common sense and the
pursuit of truth demand it, is an important and valuable principle.  But it is
a
disservice to that general principle if the courts limit the necessary
exceptions so rigidly that the general rule creates a frequent
and unnecessary
injustice."<p>
<p>
and continued at 594-5:<p>
<p>
	"In my view, it is permissible and desirable that this Court, as the final
appellate court of the nation, recognizes a new exception
to or qualification
of the hearsay rule when changing circumstances throw up an identified category
of case in which it is plain
that the inflexible application of the rule would
confound justice or common sense or produce the consequence that the law was
unattuned
to the circumstances of the society which it exists to serve."<p>
<p>
Dawson and Gaudron JJ decided <u>Pollitt</u> on another point.  They found it
unnecessary to consider whether there should be a "telephone" exception to the
rule against hearsay.
 They had some difficulty in extracting any principle
upon which such an exception could be based.<p>
<p>
Toohey J agreed that the hearsay rule should not be applied inflexibly.  He
thought that the remarks made after the telephone conversation
as to its
contents fell outside any permissible flexibility.  They were much more open to
concoction than re-active remarks made
during a telephone conversation.  McHugh
J, at 621, referred to the earlier statement of Gaudron J and himself in
<u>Benz</u> that a strong case could be made for developing and applying the
common law rules of evidence by reference to the principle that
hearsay
evidence will be admitted when it appears to have a high degree of reliability.
McHugh J stated "the exception should be
confined to categories of ordinary
social and business conversations where there is no real ground for concluding
that the identification
was fabricated or fictitious".<p>
<p>
The justices were acutely conscious of the history of the hearsay rule and the
development of the exceptions.  That history is summarised
in Lord Reid's
speech in <u>Myer</u> at 1019-1021.  He acknowledged that over the centuries
exceptions had been developed but he thought that by the end of the last
century
the principles had been settled ("stereotyped").  Lord Reid thought
that it was for the Legislature, after a wide ranging review,
to consider the
position.<p>
<p>
The justices in <u>Pollitt</u>, while accepting that the hearsay rule should
not be applied in a rigid way, were concerned about finding some satisfactory
principle
on which to base an exception.  The general statement of principle by
Deane J provides a useful starting point as does the statement
in the joint
judgment of Gaudron &amp; McHugh JJ.  In <u>Pollitt</u> there was a slight
enlargement of the exception.  One further slight enlargement may depend upon
the reliability of the material,
a very low risk of concoction and the
rejection of the hearsay material in the circumstances confronting common
sense.  Another and
perhaps virtually the only other exception may depend upon
there being circumstances establishing the occurrence of the substantive
event
(the inspection by the jury of the vehicle) and the likelihood of a comment as
to the occurrence, one being made shortly after
the event, the listeners
recalling it clearly, and the observing officer's recollection fading.<p>
<p>
The new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> may well dispense with the need to tackle some of the
problems.  That is not a matter to be pursued in these reasons.<p>
<p>
The present situation is unusual.  The matter requiring resolution is not what
materials may be taken into account in determining
the guilt or innocence of
the accused.  The point requiring resolution is what happened during the jury's
deliberations when they
inspected the utility?  Restraint is required when
entering into such a delicate and confidential area.  I understand the judge's
reluctance to venture into this area after the jury had returned its verdict
and during the sentencing proceedings.  It is unnecessary
to determine what
action, if any, he could have taken.  At that stage it may be a matter that is
better left for this Court.<p>
<p>
Questions having been raised as a result of the statements of the officer it is
in the public interest and those of the parties to
know whether the jury had
access to materials that had not been admitted into evidence and what use, if
any, they made of them.<p>
<p>
If the officer's recollection had not been defective the Court would not be
faced with the present unhappy situation.<p>
<p>
I conclude that the statements made by the officer to both Mr Rizzotto Jnr and
Messrs Bellanto and Ahern were admissible.  They formed
part of the
circumstances to be taken into account.  In amplification, I would hold,
following Brennan J in <u>Pollitt</u> at 577-578, that the making of the
statements in the terms alleged, in conjunction with the jury having inspected
the vehicle during
their deliberations, the judge having permitted them to
inspect the whole of the vehicle, and the jury earlier having indicated a
desire to do so, leads, in the light of common experience, to the inference
that the jury did inspect the tray.  Common experience
includes the curiosity
factor.<p>
<p>
If I am wrong I would regard this case as one which calls for a slight addition
to the exceptions to the hearsay rule.  To reject
the evidence would, in the
circumstances, confound common sense.<p>
<p>
It was for these reasons that I participated in the decision to admit the
evidence in question.<p>
<p>
Since argument concluded the High Court in <u>Bannon v The Queen</u>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=70%20ALJR%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">70 ALJR
25</a> held that it was there unnecessary to decide whether the exceptions to the
hearsay rule should be extended.  The court sounded a
cautious note about
further exceptions.<p>
<p>
Given the combination of circumstances, the statements of the officer should be
admitted on the basis that they go to the knowledge
of the officer when the
events occurred.  They are also admissible on the basis of their being made
spontaneously while the officer
was involved.  They form part of the
circumstances from which an inference could be drawn.  If I am wrong in the
views which I have
taken I would, if necessary, be minded to expand the
exceptions to the hearsay rule.<p>
<p>
I summarise the position thus:<p>
<p>
(a)	The utility was tendered as an exhibit by Rizzotto primarily to establish
its colour.  Rizzotto could not control the use to
which the exhibit was put.
The judge did not, on admitting the vehicle, state any restriction on the use
to which the vehicle could
be put.  It was evident that it was a ford utility
and that it had a bull bar and spotlights.  From its appearance the jury may
have
been able to assess whether it was distinctive.  It was for the jury to
decide whether the different colour descriptions (blue, light
blue or off white
or white) were of any consequence.<p>
<p>
(b)	A little later the judge refused the jury's request to look at the interior
and under the hood of the vehicle and told them that
the evidence related to
the vehicle's external appearance.  At that point the judge appeared to impose
a restriction on the use which
could be made of the vehicle.  He invited them
to send a note if they had any further requests or wished to take some course
of action
as to the vehicle.  He told them that the vehicle would be available
at any time if they wished to see it.<p>
<p>
(c)	While the jury was considering their verdict they sent a message to the
judge that they wished to see the vehicle.  The judge
appears to have advised
the legal representatives of the parties of the jury's request.  Although it is
not clear I would infer that
the judge probably saw the legal representatives
of the parties in chambers.  Apparently there is no record of what occurred.
As
the judge had previously ruled that the jury could see the utility at any
time, it remained to make some simple arrangements.<p>
(d)	Arrangements were made for the vehicle to be brought into the Court complex
by Mr Rizzotto Jnr and made available for inspection
by the jury.<p>
(e)	In the meantime the sheriff's officer, knowing what had previously happened
and being inexperienced checked with the judge's
associate as to what the jury
could inspect.  He was told that the jury could look wherever they wished.<p>
(f)	It is improbable that in answer to a query from the sheriff's officer, the
judge would have conveyed via his Associate that the
jury could look where they
wished and yet seemingly acquiesced in a submission from counsel for the
accused that the jury were not
to look inside the vehicle or under the hood.<p>
(g)	Counsel and the parties would have understood from the judge's earlier
rulings that what was relevant was the vehicle's external
appearance.<p>
(h)	I do not accept the suggestion that the jury sent a message to the judge
asking to look under the cover at the tray or all through
the vehicle.  Nor do
I accept that suggestion that the judge sent a message back to the jury and
that neither the request nor the
reply were disclosed to the parties.  I think
that the events and their sequence is as summarised.<p>
(i)	One and possibly more of the jurors may well have looked under the cover
and into the tray of the utility.<p>
(j)	No evidence was led on behalf of the appellants as to the condition of the
tray or what the jury might have seen.  Mr Rizzotto
Jnr would appear to have
been in a position to give that evidence.  This is unusual given the elaborate
preparations and arguments
on appeal.<p>
<p>
While no evidence may be led of a jury's deliberations, evidence may be given
of a material irregularity in the trial, sometimes
described as relating to
"extrinsic matters."  : <u>R v. Minarowska</u>, CCA, unreported, 23 October
1995 per Gleeson CJ at 12-13.  Material irregularities include that prejudicial
material of an evidentiary
nature not admitted on the trial was sent into the
jury room and was available to be considered by them.  Recent examples include
documents produced on subpoena, witness statements and documents considered on
a voir dire.  : <u>R v. Rinaldi</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 605.</a>  It need not be
documentary.  It is impermissible for a jury bailiff to suggest to a jury that
an accused had previous convictions.
 :  <u>R v. Brandon</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%2053%20Cr%20App%20R%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 53 Cr App R
466.</a><p>
<p>
The first question is whether there was a material irregularity.  This
question, which covers the issues of an irregularity and materiality,
sometimes
tends to merge with the next question.<p>
<p>
Once it is concluded that there was a material irregularity two inter-related
questions or perhaps a composite question arises. 
Is the court satisfied that
the irregularity did not affect the verdicts of the jury and that they would
have returned the same verdict
if the irregularity had not occurred?  The Crown
case may be very strong and it may not be possible to discern a plausible
defence
case.  The irregularity although material may not be of much
consequence overall.<p>
<p>
While the facts in <u>Stead v State Government Insurance Commission</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1986%20161%20CLR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1986
161 CLR 141</a> were very different there are significant reminders of principle.
At 145-146 the court pointed out that it is no easy task for a
court of appeal
to satisfy itself that what appears on its face to have been a denial of
natural justice could have had no bearing
on the outcome of the trial of an
issue of fact and that this difficulty is magnified when the issue concerns the
acceptance or rejection
of the testimony at the trial.<p>
<p>
At 147 the court said:<p>
<p>
"All the appellant needed to show was that the denial of natural justice
deprived him of the possibility of a successful outcome."<p>
<p>
The same principle applies where there has been a material irregularity.
Indeed it was called in aid where a judge had taken into
account material in
documents which had not been admitted into evidence.  :  <u>Hofstee v. GIO of
NSW</u>, Court of Appeal, unreported, 21 August 1995.<p>
As the car was an exhibit the jury was entitled to look at it and examine it to
the extent of the use permitted by the judge in his
rulings in open Court.
Despite the judge's comments during the sentencing proceedings (as previously
quoted) he told the jury that
he had refused their request to look under the
vehicle's hood as the evidence related to the vehicle's external colour.<p>
<p>
There has been an irregularity in that none of the jury should have looked
inside the tray of the utility.  I would not draw the
inference that in doing
so it affected the verdicts or may have done so.  The inference I would draw is
that one or more jurors made
a reasonably thorough inspection of the vehicle.
With a conventional Ford utility the tarpaulin would cover some of the
paintwork
along the top of the sides of the utility.<p>
<p>
The appellants argued that the jury must have been looking for something when
one or more looked under the cover and inside the tray.
 counsel suggested that
the jury must have been looking for the scratches which Jody claimed to have
seen.<p>
<p>
Counsel suggested that if the jury had observed scratches in the tray they
could have regarded them as supporting the evidence of
Jody.  If they had
observed no scratches they could have regarded that as affecting the
reliability of Jody's evidence.<p>
<p>
As earlier mentioned there was no evidence as to the condition of the tray at
the time of the jury's deliberations.  The accused
relied on Det Beaufils'
evidence that Jody had stated that the inside of the tray was scratched when he
looked into it and that it
had a black tarpaulin over the top of the tray.<p>
<p>
Counsel submitted that if the jury had relied on any scratches or their absence
in any way when they inspected the utility in July
1994 they were wrong to do
so.  There could have been changes between February 1991 and 13 July 1994.
Counsel submitted that it was
sufficient if there was a reasonable possibility
that the jury had examined the tray for scratch marks and relied upon what they
saw.<p>
<p>
The jury, indeed any jury, would have appreciated that scratches in the trays
of utilities are common, that they were viewing the
utility over three years
after Jody had claimed to have seen it and that any scratches which may have
been there in July 1994 (and
there is no evidence that there were any at that
time) may not have been there in about February 1991.  Scratches in the tray in
1991 may not have been there in July 1994.  It is important not to
underestimate the jury's ability, reasoning, power and common
sense.  There is
no reasonable possibility that the jury approached the question of the
scratches (if any at July 1994) in the manner
suggested by the appellants.<p>
<p>
The irregularity was not material in that it could not be regarded as a
reasonable possibility that the jury looking at the tray
would prejudice the
appellants and affect them adversely.<p>
<p>
There is an alternative approach which may be preferable.  The irregularity
could be classed as a material irregularity because the
jury had looked at a
portion of the vehicle not encompassed by the judge's earlier ruling (that is,
inside the tray).  <p>
<p>
While possible, it is unlikely that the sheriff's officer misunderstood what he
was told via the Associate.  Again this involves
the jury incorrectly seeing
the tray.<p>
<p>
However the matter is approached, I do not think that the jury (or one or more
of them) viewing the tray had any bearing on the outcome
of the trial.<p>
<p>
There is no reason to suppose that the jury did not consider the question of
the colour of the vehicle and the evidence given in
that regard.  It was for
them to decide whether the differences were important and whether they were
satisfied that, even if there
was a mistake in perceptions or recollection as
to the colour of Rizzotto's utility, it was at the plantation in February 1991.
The
issue was whether the appellants were at the meeting on that occasion.<p>
<p>
It is my opinion that by reason of what occurred the appellants were not
deprived of the possibility of a successful outcome.<p>
<p>
This challenge to the verdicts fails.<p>
<p>
<u>Identification Evidence - Jody Parker</u><p>
Rizzotto complained that in admitting (over objection) evidence of photographic
identification of him by Jody Parker the judge erred.<p>
Rizzotto (whose name was then unknown to Jody) was described by Jody as being
of Italian descent, about 55, 5'6" and mainly bald
on the top of the head.  He
had no particular distinguishing feature or characteristic.<p>
<p>
On 13 March 1991 Det Beaufils, in interviewing Jody at Mt Grenfell Station,
showed him 20 photographs.  The judge described them
as mostly amateur type
snapshots.  It seems that the photographs were snaps taken at a distance
outside Dubbo Court House of Rizzotto
and people going to or coming from the
Court.  There was some noticeable disparity in the appearance and in the ages
of the persons
shown.  One snapshot appeared to be of a local solicitor.<p>
<p>
About ten of the photographs were of people who did not appear to be Italian
and others did not fit the general description.  In
other words, the men in 14
of the photos bore little resemblance to Rizzotto.  In six of the photos
Rizzotto either appeared alone
or with another person.  When Jody looked
through the photographs he noticed that there was more than one photograph of
the same
person.  He was also told by the police that they believed that the
suspect was amongst the photographs.<p>
<p>
The judge noted that in two of the six photographs slightly different clothing
was worn and that Jody identified the accused in all
six photographs.
Initially, Jody had some doubts about the man in two of these photographs but
by looking at the other four photographs
about which he had no doubts he
confirmed his identification of the appellant Rizzotto in those two
photographs.  The judge thought
that it would be difficult for anyone who did
not know Rizzotto to say with any degree of certainty that all six related to
the same
person.<p>
<p>
The judge held that Jody had ample opportunity to become familiar with the
appearance of some of the men involved in the cultivation
of the plantation,
that Jody was in a position to identify some of those men and that he
identified Rizzotto as one of the men involved
in the plantation.  Obviously,
Jody would be able to identify those who worked on the property, for example,
the three shepherds.
 So an important question was the extent of the
observation of Rizzotto by Jody.<p>
<p>
He thought that Rizzotto was among the men who attended the meeting behind the
quarry but he was not sure and had some doubt.  At
a later meeting which Jody
thought took place in December 1990 at the crop site Jody saw Rizzotto.  Jody
recalled Rizzotto shifting
the sprinklers out further to ensure that the plants
on the edge of the patch received water.  Jody recalled that Rizzotto was
interested
in the SKK rifle which Hayden had and wanted one for himself.
(Calabria also apparently wanted one).  Jody's father agreed to go
and buy two
SKK rifles.  This meeting must have lasted for some time.<p>
Jody said that at the subsequent meeting at The Pines he saw Rizzotto.  That
man was involved in a discussion with Jody's father
and others about some
missing money.  Jody estimated that the meeting took about two or three
hours.<p>
<p>
There was a fourth occasion on which Jody said he saw Rizzotto.  That was in
about February 1991 at the log cabin.  He also saw the
utility and Calabria
drive it.<p>
<p>
In cross examination Jody agreed that in his first statement to the police
which was lengthy and made on 11 March 1991 he did not
mention Rizzotto (the
man in the photograph at Dubbo).  He let the police know that he had further
information and they came to see
him at the family home on 13 March 1991.<p>
<p>
Jody agreed that in his interview of 13 March 1991 he nominated two occasions
on which he had seen Rizzotto and said, "I think I
saw him in a blue Ford ute".
Jody said that he definitely saw Rizzotto at the log cabin.  Jody also thought
that he saw Rizzotto
in the vehicle but he had some doubt about that.  He said
that he did mention in his interview that he had seen Rizzotto at the Pines
(Question &amp; Answer 20) but he did not mention seeing him at the quarry.<p>
<p>
The evidence of Jody Parker established that he saw Rizzotto on at least three
occasions and probably on a fourth occasion, that
is, at the quarry.  They were
not fleeting glimpses.  Jody had a good opportunity to observe Rizzotto over
substantial periods.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto submitted that the judge should have rejected the tender of the 20
photographs shown to Jody by Beaufils and Jody's identification
of Rizzotto as
one of the men involved in the production and intended sale of the crop.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto relied on the adoption by Gibbs CJ in <u>Alexander v. The Queen</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=145%20CLR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">145 CLR 395</a> at 403 of the remarks of Richmond P in <u>Reg. v. Russell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1977%202%20NZLR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1977
2 NZLR 20</a> at 28 that "only in exceptional cases should photographs be used at a
stage when some particular person is directly suspected by
the police and they
are able to arrange an identification parade or some other satisfactory
alternative means whereby the witness
can be asked directly to identify the
suspected person".<p>
<p>
At 431 Mason J wrote that this observation was designed to ensure that the
police acted with propriety, it was not a statement of
law.<p>
<p>
In <u>Alexander</u> it was accepted by all justices that it was acceptable for
the police in the investigation and detection phase to show witnesses
a group
of photographs and for any identification so made to be given in evidence.<p>
<p>
Stephen J at 417 wrote that the cases disclosed that when photo identification
is used after the detection process is over that will
in itself be a strong
ground for excluding from the trial all evidence of identification by a witness
who has been involved in that
photo - identification.  The police will in such
a case already know, at the time of the photo-identification, the identity of
the
"wanted man".<p>
<p>
Mason J, with whom Aickin J agreed said at 431:<p>
<p>
	"... And I should have thought it essential to the efficient investigation and
detection of crime that the police should continue
to be at liberty to ask a
potential witness to make an identification from photographs, even though they
have a particular suspect
in mind.  In cases of serious crime it would unduly
hamper police investigations if they were compelled to disclose to a suspect
that he was under suspicion by requesting him to participate in an
identification parade."<p>
<p>
Murphy J at 436 expressed views similar to those of Stephen J.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto submitted that as at 13 March 1991 he was a suspected person.  For
some weeks police had been monitoring his residential
telephone service.  Mr
Holmes had gone to the police about 9 February 1991.  The police had made a
series of arrests on 11 March
1991.  Rizzotto probably attended at Dubbo Court
on either 12 or 13 March 1991.  The police took their photos.  They probably
believed
that Rizzotto may be involved in the cultivation but could not prove
it at that stage.  Det Beaufils agreed that Rizzotto was a suspect.
 It is
unlikely that the police would have had a translation of the tapes by the time
they saw Jody on 13 March 1991.  Rizzotto was
not arrested until about 27 April
1991.  The police may also have hoped to obtain some useful material by
continuing to intercept
the telephone calls to and from Rizzotto's home.  Any
identification parade would see that source dry up.<p>
<p>
I prefer the approach adopted by Mason J.  I doubt if it could be said that as
at 13 March 1991 the investigative and detection processes
had been completed.
The judge did not deal with this point in his reasons although it was taken in
the written submissions before
him but not as fully as before this court.  The
judge made a general reference to <u>Alexander</u>.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto submitted that no satisfactory reason had been advanced for an
identification parade not being held.  I disagree.  As at
13 March 1991 the
police were in the middle of their investigations.  They were trying to
identify and locate all those who may be
involved and to ascertain what role
they may have played and what evidence existed.  There were obvious
difficulties in relation
to those who were not on the site.  The police spent
some six weeks pursuing their enquiries before searching the premises of the
appellants and arresting them.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto submitted that the judge failed to properly consider the relatively
low probative value of the photo-identification and
its substantial prejudicial
effect.  The judge did not specifically advert to this point in his reasons
although the point was taken
in the written submissions placed before the
judge.  The photographs used by Det Beaufils and the procedures he employed
were flawed
and unsatisfactory.  I have earlier mentioned the excessive number
of photographs of Rizzotto among the bundle and that the men in
most of the
remaining photos did not look like Rizzotto and that Jody was looking for a
balding Italian aged about 55 who was not
distinctive.  Jody understood that a
photograph of the suspect was amongst the bundle.  Given what Jody was looking
for and the bundle
of photographs handed to Jody there was a good chance that
he would select those of Rizzotto.<p>
<p>
The judge said:<p>
<p>
	"While it could be said that it is unfortunate that six of the twenty photos
were of the accused Rizzotto I am satisfied that the
showing of them to Jody
Parker in the way in which they were shown to him did not constitute or create
any unfairness to the accused."<p>
<p>
From my earlier discussion it will be apparent that I am unable to agree with
this conclusion.<p>
<p>
The Crown correctly submitted, applying <u>R v. A.J.Munro</u>, CCA, unreported
30 June 1994 at 6-7, that the first question was whether the judge's exercise
of discretion was attended by such
error as to warrant intervention.  The Crown
submitted that no identifiable error could be found and that the judge's
exercise of
his discretion was not so clearly wrong as to warrant the
conclusion that the judge's process of reasoning must have been affected
by
some undisclosed error.<p>
<p>
As earlier indicated the judge did not deal with a number of matters and it was
not open to say that the process was not unfair.
 Jody was 17, worried about
his own position, the trouble he could face and anxious to co-operate.<p>
<p>
The key to the judge's approach was the ample opportunity Jody had to observe
Rizzotto on at least three occasions, the observations
Jody made and his
positive identification of Rizzotto.  The judge was also impressed that Jody
was able to nominate all six photographs
of Rizzotto from the bundle.<p>
<p>
In <u>Alexander</u> at 402-403 Gibbs CJ stated that as a matter of law evidence
of an identification made out of Court by the use of photographs is admissible
but a trial judge has a discretion to exclude any evidence if the strict rules
of admissibility operate unfairly against the accused.
 The Chief Justice
continued that it would be right to exercise that discretion in any case in
which the judge was of opinion that
the evidence had little weight but was
likely to be gravely prejudicial to the accused.<p>
<p>
Mason J at 430 said:<p>
<p>
	"... the Australian cases demonstrate that identification from police
photographs is admissible evidence, that its probative value
may be important,
that the judge has a discretion to exclude it when he considers its prejudicial
effect outweighs that value, and
that directions may be given to ensure that
unfair use is not made of the evidence .... The approach taken in the
Australian cases
... accords with what this Court said in <u>Davies and Cody v.
The King</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=57%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(57 CLR 170</a> at 180-181) when it pointed out - that "in each case
the question must be, not whether the identification has been conducted with
propriety and fairness, but whether upon the whole evidence as it in fact
existed when it came to be laid before the jury, and having
full regard to the
treatment of the matter at the trial, the actual verdict ought not to stand
because a miscarriage of the kind
described occurred".<p>
<p>
His Honour concluded:<p>
<p>
	"... we would be best advised to adhere to the approach ... in <u>Davies and
Cody</u> by giving attention to the whole of the evidence and the treatment of
the matter at the trial and deciding whether a miscarriage
has occurred whereby
the conviction cannot safely stand."<p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the flawed and unfair procedures followed by Det Beaufils the
evidence of Jody had considerable probative value if
accepted.  He had seen
Rizzotto for extended periods.  Jody had absorbed what Rizzotto looked like and
had a picture of him in his
(Jody's) mind.  His observations enabled him to
identify Rizzotto.  This was the view of the judge.  The probative value far
outweighed
any prejudicial effect.<p>
<p>
The errors made by the judge did not affect his view of the critical issue that
Jody was reliably able to identify Rizzotto, having
seen him for extended
periods.<p>
<p>
As there were errors I have looked at the matter afresh and, allowing fully for
the defects mentioned, I would have admitted the
challenged evidence.<p>
<p>
This photo-identification was correctly admitted.<p>
<p>
<u>Identification Evidence - Hayden Parker</u><p>
Rizzotto submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice in that Hayden
Parker was shown six colour photographs of Rizzotto by
the police prior to the
Identification Parade.  Rizzotto submitted that the investigative and detection
processes had passed by that
stage.<p>
<p>
The judge was asked to exclude evidence of Hayden Parker and others as to
identifying Rizzotto at the Identification Parade.  This
matter was dealt with
on the voir dire prior to the start of the trial.  Amongst other materials, the
judge had evidence given by
Hayden Parker at the committal proceedings.  The
judge was not satisfied that when Hayden said he had seen photographs before he
attended the line up (30 April 1991) Hayden was acknowledging that he had seen
a photograph of Rizzotto.  The judge held that from
the other evidence it did
not seem that he was shown such a photograph prior to the line up.<p>
<p>
In cross examination at the trial Hayden said that he was at the homestead on
13 March 1991 when the police interviewed his brother
and that the police
showed him some photographs.  After being shown exhibits 1A and 1B, being the
20 photos shown to Jody, Hayden
confirmed that they were the photos which he
had been shown.<p>
<p>
Beaufils gave no evidence at the trial of showing these 20 photographs to
Hayden and he was not asked.  The other officer present
on 13 March 1991 at the
homestead was not called - presumably no one thought that this was necessary.<p>
<p>
Counsel for Rizzotto submitted that the evidentiary position had changed and
required re-consideration of the earlier ruling.  He
submitted that the
evidence which had been admitted as to the identification parade should not go
before the jury.  The identification
was tainted and would taint the
proceedings and any verdict.<p>
<p>
The judge specifically and correctly left it to the jury to decide whether
Hayden was shown any photographs of Rizzotto prior to
the identification
parade.  After reminding the jury of Hayden's evidence the judge pointed out
that Hayden had not been asked any
questions as to what he had observed about
the photographs.  Counsel did not pursue with Hayden the effect of having seen
the photographs
on 13 March 1991 on his identification on 30 April.  There is
no material as to how long Hayden spent looking at the photographs.
 He did not
remember that there was more than one photograph of Rizzotto.  At SU 227 the
judge said:<p>
<p>
	"Was this a genuine identification of the accused in the sense that resulted
from a recollection by Hayden Parker of any person
or of him seeing the accused
at the plantation in the circumstances that he indicated to you during the
course of his evidence? 
Or was it an identification by him of a person he had
seen in a photograph some time before or was it just guess work on his part?"<p>
<p>
At SU 250-251 the judge put the competing arguments and reminded the jury that
the onus was on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable
doubt that Hayden made a
proper identification of Rizzotto.<p>
<p>
As at 13 March 1991 the police were carrying out their investigations.  The
showing of photographs does not necessarily make the
identification parade
evidence inadmissible.  It did not do so in the present case:  <u>Alexander</u>
at 400, 417-418 and 430-431.<p>
<p>
The evidence of Hayden showed that he had observed Rizzotto over a period on
the occasion of the sale and purchase of the rifle and
should have been and was
able to identify him.<p>
<p>
Kevin Parker was unable to identify Rizzotto at the identification parade but
that does not mean that the identification of either
of his sons was suspect.<p>
 <p>
The judge did not err in admitting the evidence of the identification parade.<p>
<p>
<u>Isolating The Deficiencies</u><p>
Rizzotto submitted that the judge erred in failing to identify and isolate for
the jury the specific deficiencies as to Exhibits
1A and 1B (the six photos of
Rizzotto and the 14 photographs of others outside Dubbo Court House) and in
failing to warn the jury
that in the specific circumstances it would be
dangerous to rely on such evidence.<p>
<p>
Between SU pp.131 and 158 the judge summarised in considerable detail the
evidence of Jody Parker.  At SU 136 the judge summarised
what occurred when
Jody was shown 20 photographs and Mr Bellanto's attack upon it for unfairness.
At SU 143-147 the judge summarised
Jody's evidence in cross examination as to
the photographs and that summary exposed the weaknesses in that evidence.<p>
<p>
At SU 222-228 the judge listed the general considerations which the jury should
take into account when considering identification
evidence, for example,
whether the person identified was a stranger, what opportunity for accurate
observation existed, the features
of the person allegedly identified, whether
the person was amongst a group of persons, the time the witness had to observe
the person
and the period between the initial observation(s) and a later
identification, etc.  As to Hayden Parker's identification of Rizzotto
the jury
were directed to consider whether Hayden had previously seen any photographs of
Rizzotto and whether that affected Hayden
in his observations at the
identification parade.  As earlier mentioned the jury at SU 227 was directed to
consider whether there
was a genuine identification of Rizzotto by Hayden at
the identification parade.<p>
<p>
At SU 245-250 the judge again returned to the subject and dealt with the
disadvantages of photo-identification and explained that
it was inferior to an
identification parade.  The jury was in effect asked to consider how long each
of the meetings took and whether
that bore upon the opportunity for observation
and how long elapsed between the time the witness last observed the appellants
(or
one of them) and saw the photographs.  The judge reminded the jury of the
challenge to Hayden's identification at the identification
parade because he
had previously been shown a number of photographs of Rizzotto.  At SU 372-373
the judge summarised the attack of
Mr Bellanto upon the identification by Jody
and Hayden.  Both were flawed and he detailed the reasons advanced by Mr
Bellanto.<p>
<p>
Mr Bellanto accepted that the judge summarised the evidence and the major
points counsel made in cross examination and his many criticisms
of the
identification procedures, the evidence and its weaknesses.  However Mr
Bellanto's complaint is that the judge's directions
fell short of the required
standard as set out in <u>Domican v. The Queen</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=173%20CLR%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">173 CLR 555</a> at 561-562:<p>
<p>
	"... the judge must warn the jury as to the dangers of convicting on
[identification evidence] where its reliability is disputed.
 ... The warning
must be cogent and effective.  It must be appropriate to the circumstances of
the case.  Consequently, the jury
must be instructed 'as to the factors which
may affect the consideration of the [identification] evidence in the particular
case'.
 A warning in general terms is insufficient.  The attention of the jury
'should be drawn to any weakness in the identification evidence'.
 Reference to
counsel's argument is insufficient.  The jury must have the benefit of a
direction which has the authority of the judge's
office behind it.  It follows
that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury
any matter of significance
which may reasonably be regarded as under-mining the
reliability of the identification evidence."<p>
<p>
<u>Domican</u> was applied by this Court in <u>R v. Heuston</u>, CCA,
unreported 20 June 1995.  At p.12 Hunt CJ at CL pointed out that in
<u>Domican</u> the High Court had not held that the jury have to be given to
understand that the judge agrees that the identification evidence was
in fact
weakened by the particular matters to which attention is being drawn.  The
judge's obligation is to warn the jury as to the
dangers inherent in
identification evidence and to tell them that they are bound to take the
particular matters to which attention
is drawn into consideration in evaluating
the identification evidence because those matters may reasonably be regarded as
undermining
the reliability of the identification evidence.<p>
<p>
At p.3 of my reasons in <u>Heuston</u> I set out my understanding of the
principles in <u>Domican</u>.<p>
<p>
There may be a number of respects in which the identification evidence may be
strongly and rightly criticised.  Nevertheless, the
jury may be satisfied that
the identification has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  For example, the
witness may have had an
extended opportunity to observe the accused on a number
of occasions so that an impression of the accused (along with his features)
became implanted in the witness' consciousness.<p>
<p>
The judge stated (SU 221) that the history of the criminal law indicated very
clearly that any evidence of personal identification
of a person as being one
of those involved in a particular criminal activity should be tried with very
considerable caution as that
history demonstrated that mistakes in
identification had often been made.  He warned the jury that no matter how
confident a witness
or witnesses may appear to be, they should scrutinize such
identification evidence most carefully.  He stated that even a number
of
witnesses may be wrong (SU 222).  The judge told the jury that bearing in mind
all the circumstances, the considerations earlier
mentioned and any question of
identification, they should carefully evaluate the evidence of alleged
identification and that such
evidence should be treated with very considerable
caution.  He added it may be both honest and correct, on the other hand it may
be honest and wrong.  In re-iteration, he said ..."identification evidence is
evidence that must be closely scrutinised by you at
all times" (SU 228-228A).
At SU 244 (after the intervening weekend) the judge reminded the jury that they
should be very cautious
in acting upon any identification evidence placed
before them; honest and reliable witnesses can be persuasive but mistaken.<p>
<p>
The judge (SU 245) highlighted that an identification parade was a better means
of identification than using photographs and the
difficulties with photographs.
He reminded the jury that the estimates of Mr Parker of the length of the
various meetings was less
than that of his sons.  He reminded the jury that the
period of observation and the distances from which the observations were made
and the quality of the photographs were important in evaluating the
identification evidence.<p>
<p>
When the various parts of the judge's summing up dealing with identification
are considered in their totality it emerges that the
jury received extensive
warnings as to the difficulties with identification evidence and the need to
scrutinize it "most carefully"
and treat it with caution.  The judge referred
to the relevant problems with the identification evidence in the present case.
He
referred to the importance of the jury assessing the opportunities for
observation by the various witnesses.  That was crucial in
the present case.
The judge effectively told the jury to consider the weaknesses which were
isolated, the opportunities for accurate
observation, the time lapses and to
approach the identification evidence with very considerable caution.  They were
told to evaluate
the position carefully and decide whether they had any
problems with the identification evidence and whether they were satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt on the identifications.<p>
<p>
The directions given were adequate.  This ground of appeal is not made out.<p>
<p>
<u>Admission Of Tapes</u><p>
Rizzotto contended that the judge erred in admitting into evidence tape
recordings of telephonic intercepts (exhibit 34, tapes 312
&amp; 441; exhibit
34A, tapes 55 &amp; 1165; exhibit 35, tapes 496, 525, 637 (or 647) &amp; 783;
and exhibit 1D, tapes 515, 518 &amp;
636) as evidence of common purpose.<p>
<p>
Some of the tapes (55, 312, 1165 and 441) were admitted against all accused at
the trial and the remainder were admitted against
Rizzotto.  Some of the
remainder were admitted against Calabria.  These were tapes of conversations
between the two men and their
homes.<p>
<p>
The judgment given reveals that the judge was aware of the approach which he
should take and the principles to be applied.  This
is also reflected in the
way he separated the tapes and the basis on which various tapes were admitted.
Further, there is no error
apparent in the way in which the judge applied the
principles.<p>
<p>
In <u>Tripodi v. The Queen</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=104%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">104 CLR 1</a> at 7 Dixon CJ, Fullagar and Windeyer
JJ said:<p>
<p>
	"When the case for the prosecution is that in the commission of the crime a
number of men acted in preconcert, reasonable evidence
of the preconcert must
be adduced before evidence of acts or words of one of the parties in
furtherance of the common purpose which
constitutes or forms an element of the
crime becomes admissible against the other or others, that is to say of course,
unless some
other ground for admitting the evidence exists in the given
case."<p>
<p>
By the time the tapes were tendered the court had heard the evidence of Mr
Parker, Jody and Hayden.  That evidence was eloquent of
a group of men acting
in preconcert as to the cultivation of a large drug crop.  If accepted, it also
established that Rizzotto and
Calabria were acting in preconcert and were part
of the group.<p>
<p>
The judge did not err in admitting the tapes.  This challenge fails.<p>
<u>Alleged Unsafe And Unsatisfactory Verdict</u><p>
<u></u>Rizzotto submitted that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory.  It
was contended that the evidence of Jody Parker lacked probative
value and was
unreliable.  The reasons included that Detective Beaufils in his evidence
(T678/679 and T720-721) said that on 10 April
1991 he showed Jody Parker, a
photograph of the Ford utility.  On the same occasion he also showed Jody about
32 photographs of people.
 Detective Beaufils was explicit that he showed Jody
only one photograph of a vehicle.  He believed that the principle of showing
a
witness a series of photographs related to the identification of people not
objects.  Jody believed he was shown more than one
photograph of vehicles.  He
was not sure how many.  This was based on his belief that the police always
showed him a number of photographs.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto relied on the comments of Jody when shown some recent photographs of
the utility.  Jody thought that the position of the
sticker on the roo bar had
been altered.  Jody said that if it was the same vehicle it had been painted
white or the utility was
a lot older.  He commented that the stickers on the
lights were a lot duller in some of the photos.  Jody thought that some photos
did not appear to be of the same vehicle.  The prosecution case was that the
vehicle remained the same colour.  Reliance was also
placed on the position of
the signatures on the reverse side of the photographs in Ex 1A and 1B.
Rizzotto also relied on the defects
earlier noted in relation to the
identification evidence of Jody and the inspection of the utility.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto further submitted that the evidence of Hayden Parker lacked probative
value and was unreliable.  His father attended the
same identification parade
but failed to identify the appellant, that parade was held over three months
after the rifle incident
and the showing of photographs to Hayden Parker by the
police some time prior to the parade.  Counsel referred the court to a number
of articles on identification problems and drew attention to the problem when a
person falls into an ethnic or cultural group.<p>
<p>
All the matters were strenuously covered in the evidence and the addresses of
counsel.  The summing up also dealt with them.  I have
made my own independent
assessment of the evidence.  There was ample opportunity for extended
observation of Rizzotto.  If this had
been a case of fleeting glimpses or a
short period of observation such as a couple of minutes I may well have taken a
different view.
 There was also other evidence.  I do not regard the matters
upon which Rizzotto relied as being of great moment.<p>
<p>
There was more than enough evidence of sufficient quality upon which the jury
could safely convict.<p>
<u>Conclusion</u><p>
<u></u>The trial judge in his remarks on sentence said that he had no
hesitation in accepting Jody Parker as "a most impressive, reliable
and honest
witness."<p>
The judge also said:<p>
<p>
I have no doubt that the circumstantial evidence tendered in these proceedings
was the most telling factor in this case so far as
you were both concerned
because in the case of a co-accused by the name of Rocco Prochilo, the jury
found him not guilty even though
the direct identification evidence against him
was of a similar nature to that tendered against the two of you, while the
circumstantial
evidence tendered against him was nowhere near as strong as that
relied upon by the Crown against the two of you."<p>
<p>
I agree with the thrust of the judge's remarks.  The circumstantial evidence
against Prochilo was not nearly as strong as that against
the appellants.
Against them it was powerful and difficult to explain away on any realistic
basis.<p>
<p>
The trial was a lengthy and difficult one in which the judge took considerable
pains with his rulings and summing up.  I have given
close consideration to
Rizzotto's challenges.  No miscarriage of justice has occurred.  His appeal
should be dismissed.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Calabria's Appeal</u><p>
<u>Impermissible Use Of Utility - (Ground 3)</u><p>
The material relating to this ground is set out earlier.  There was a major
challenge to the evidence of Jody Parker that the utility
of Rizzotto was on Mt
Grenfell Station in February 1991 and was being driven by Calabria.  I would
make the same findings and reach
the same conclusions on this point as earlier
stated.<p>
<p>
<u>Reception Of Photographic Identification Evidence Of Calabria</u><p>
<u></u>Calabria complained that the judge erred in admitting evidence of
photographic identification by each of the three Parkers.<p>
<p>
On 10 May 1991 the police showed Parker 9 photographs from which he nominated a
photograph of Calabria as one of the 4 or 5 people
who had attended at Mr
Grenfell Station to see if there was a site suitable for growing a marijuana
crop.  He was the man in the
terry towelling hat. (T166)  Parker and these
visitors or investors got into the one vehicle and drove around the property
looking
for a suitable site.  It would have taken a little time.  At New
Mountain Paddock Jody and Hayden joined them.  They moved through
Pig's Paddock
to Creek Paddock where they discussed what was going to happen.  They were at
the property for 1 to 11/2 hours.  He
thought that person was also present at
the meeting at the gravel pit.  Parker said that the man (Calabria) was present
at the meeting
at the Pines with others. (T181)  This was the last time he saw
that person.<p>
<p>
Parker had recorded on the back of the photo he nominated "Possibly the man
that wore towelling hat that came to property."  Parker
agreed that on the
occasions he saw the man nominated in the photograph he (Parker) had little to
do with that man.<p>
<p>
On 9 May 1991 Det Beaufils showed Jody 10 photographs and he nominated a
photograph of a man he knew as Old Frank as being one of
the investors.
(T239/240)  It was a photograph of Calabria.  He met the investors on their
inspection of the property and selection
of a site for the intended crop
(T241).  Jody saw Old Frank at the gravel pit and, it seems, at the crop site
immediately after that.
(T245)  <p>
<p>
Jody said that Old Frank was also present on an occasion in about early
December 1990. (T247)  This appears to be the occasion of
the rifle incident.
Jody stated that Old Frank was at the Pines.  Jody also saw Old Frank at the
log cabin on Mt Grenfell Station.
 That was the occasion on which he saw the
utility.<p>
<p>
On 9 May 1991 the police showed Hayden Parker twelve photographs and he
nominated a photograph of a man who was Calabria.  He knew
the man as Old Frank
and one of the investors.  He was one of a small group of people gathered at
Quartz Hill dam.  His father spoke
with them and drove them around the
property.  Hayden followed them for about half an hour as they looked at
different places on
the station.<p>
<p>
Hayden recalled an occasion on which a number of people unloaded his father's
semi-trailer.  Old Frank was one of the men helping.
 A little later he went to
the log cabin and saw the men who had previously been at the truck.
Subsequently he saw the men at the
Creek Paddock, ploughing.<p>
<p>
Hayden also attended at the gravel pit (or quarry) and saw the same group of
men and a few others.  Later they attended at Creek
Paddock on the station.
Around this period he sold his rifle at the crop site.<p>
<p>
He was cross examined extensively about omissions from his earlier statement
and the pressures which he was under.  He readily admitted
that he was under
much pressure.  He was worried about his own situation and that of his family
and gave the police as much assistance
as he could.<p>
<p>
<u>Obtaining Photos Of Calabria</u><p>
<u></u>Calabria contended that the photographs of him shown to each of the
Parkers were unlawfully and improperly obtained when seized from
Calabria's
home purportedly pursuant to a search warrant.<p>
<p>
A search warrant was obtained to search Calabria's premises and it was executed
about 7.45 a.m. on 27 April 1991 by Sgt Dolan and
other police officers.  The
search warrant permitted searching for and holding:<p>
"Reference books and documents relating to the cultivation of cannabis, pumps
and irrigation equipment, pump used for the cultivation
of cannabis."<p>
<p>
Det Longford took the view, relying on the word "documents" that this
authorised her to remove photographs of Calabria and other
household members
from a family photo album.  She believed that they may assist in identifying
some of those involved in the cultivation
of the cannabis crop at Cobar.  The
matter does not rest there.  She gave evidence that she asked Mrs Calabria if
she could take
them and that Mrs Calabria gave her permission to do so.  There
was evidence to the contrary from Mrs Calabria and supporting evidence
from
Calabria and a sister-in-law.  There was evidence that Mrs Calabria did not
speak English, even though she had been in Australia
for 32 years and her
children spoke English and Italian.  Her husband spoke a reasonable amount of
English.  Mrs Calabria claimed
that she did not become aware that the
photographs had been taken until some later date.  The judge considered the
evidence and was
satisfied that he could safely act on the evidence of Det
Longford as to what occurred and he preferred her evidence.  The judge
was not
impressed by the evidence of Mrs Calabria and he did not accept her evidence
that she was unaware that the photos were taken
and that she did not consent to
the police officer taking those photographs.<p>
My examination of the evidence in question leads me to the view that the
evidence of Det Longford was cogent and that of Mrs Calabria
was not, even
making all proper allowances for her being in the strange environment of a
court room and using an interpreter.  The
evidence of Calabria and the
sister-in-law went to secondary matters.  The judge had the advantage of seeing
all the witnesses. 
The findings which he made were well open to him and there
is no basis for disturbing them.<p>
<p>
The judge held that Det Longford took the photos because she believed that they
would be of assistance to the police in identifying
those involved in the
cultivation of the cannabis crop at Cobar and that she was entitled to take
them pursuant to the <u>Search Warrants Act</u> and that their taking was
within the principles in <u>George v. Rockett</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 102</a> at
119/120.  The judge also held that Mrs Calabria knew and consented to the
police officer taking the photographs.  This finding
disposes of the argument
that the photos were unlawfully and improperly obtained.<p>
<p>
Calabria contended that the evidence should also be rejected on the ground that
the best evidence as to the obtaining of the photographs
was not led at the
committal proceedings.  The magistrate discharged Calabria, an ex officio
indictment was filed and the best evidence
was led on the voir dire.  That
evidence was accepted.  This is not a sufficient basis for rejecting the
photographs collected from
Mrs Calabria and the evidence based upon them.<p>
<p>
<u>Unfairness</u><p>
<u></u>Calabria further submitted that it was unfair to him to admit the
photo-identification evidence.  He claimed that Detectives Henry
and Beaufils
chose that method over an identification parade or parades when there was no
impediment to conducting a parade.<p>
<p>
Det Henry said that he spoke to the police who went to Calabria's house on 27
April 1991 and to Calabria's solicitor that afternoon.
 He became aware from
police materials that while Calabria was prepared to be interviewed about the
guns found in his house he was
not prepared to be interviewed about the crop at
Mt Grenfell Station.  Det Henry said that it was implied and apparent that
Calabria
would not participate in an identification parade.  Det Henry was
aware that in relation to the line up arranged for Prochilo, his
solicitor (who
also acted for Calabria) would only permit Mr K Parker being asked to attempt
the identification.  He failed to identify
Rizzotto at an earlier line up.<p>
<p>
Believing that Calabria would not take part in a line-up Det Henry showed the
photographs to the Parkers.  They identified Calabria
and thus his arrest and
charging could now justifiably take place.  Within a relatively short period a
request was made to Calabria's
solicitor for Calabria's attendance.  Calabria
attended and was charged.  As the photographs had been shown to the Parkers
Calabria
was not asked to take part in a line-up.  Det Henry still wanted to
ask Calabria some questions and asked him if he wished to participate
in an
interview.  Calabria declined.<p>
<p>
Det Beaufils was not in charge of the investigation.  As at 9 May 1991 as an
investigator it was his intention to seek an identification
parade with
Calabria if available.  Det Beaufils had arranged for the Parkers to come to
Griffith.<p>
<p>
During 9 May 1991 Det Beaufils was present during portions of conversation
between Det Henry and the solicitor for Prochilo.  Det
Beaufils stated that he
also spoke with the solicitor.  After the identification parade involving
Prochilo, Det Beaufils stated that
he had a general recollection not a direct
recollection, that the solicitor said words to the effect that Calabria was not
going
to participate in a line up and was not going to answer questions and
that if the police had enough to charge Calabria they should
do so.  There was
nothing in Det Beaufils statement about these matters but it did contain
references to what happened on 10 May
1991 including Calabria's attendance at
the police station and declining to take part in an interview.<p>
<p>
The judge was satisfied having regard to the whole of the evidence and
particularly that of Dets Henry and Beaufils that the police
had satisfactorily
explained why no identification parade was held as to Calabria on the Mt
Grenfell Station crop.  The judge appears
to have accepted that the police were
given to understand by Calabria's solicitor that Calabria would not participate
in a line up
or interview.  The judge found that the procedure adopted was
appropriate in the circumstances.  Calabria challenged the judges'
findings.
There was no evidence from Calabria's solicitor refuting what had been
attributed to him.  The judges findings, were open
on the evidence.  If these
findings are permissible it is difficult to see how there could be any
successful challenge to the admission
of that photo-identification.  When the
police prepared for and held an identification parade with Prochilo it is not
easy to accept
that they would not have done so for Calabria if he was prepared
to take part.  The judge was also of the view that the authorities
established
that the absence of an identification parade did not of itself make other
identification evidence inadmissible.  He referred
to <u>R v. Pearsall</u>
(1990) 49 A Crim R 429 at 442 where the Court of Criminal Appeal (per Hunt J)
said:<p>
<p>
"The mere absence of an identification parade does not of itself make the
evidence inadmissible; its absence may affect the weight
of the identification
evidence, but it cannot make it relevant.<p>
<p>
At 442 Hunt J discussed the exclusion of evidence on discretionary grounds.
Would it result in a trial that was unfair to the accused.
 Had the reliability
of the evidence been affected.  The judge considered these matters and ruled
that there would be no unfairness
as so understood.  There is no sufficient
basis on which his discretionary decisions can be set aside.<p>
<p>
At 444 Hunt J pointed out that the absence of an identification parade may, in
some cases, mean that the weight to be afforded to
the evidence of
identification is so little that the trial judge is obliged to reject it, upon
the basis that its probative value
is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
That is not the present case where the identifiers had the opportunity of
extended observation.
 Further, the judge accepted the explanation for not
holding such a parade.<p>
<p>
I have considered Calabria's complaints individually and as a whole.  There was
no relevant unfairness and the evidence was correctly
admitted.<p>
<p>
<u>Quality Of Identification Evidence</u><p>
<u></u>Calabria submitted that the quality of the identification evidence was
so poor that it lacked probity, or, its probative value was
outweighed by its
prejudicial effect.  Calabria contended that the photographs were old and of
poor quality and did not show height,
temperament or personality.  Each of the
identifying witnesses was arrested on 11 March 1991.  Hayden was never charged.
Each looked
at the photographs two months later.  Each had been subjected to a
number of records of interviews or making statements.  They knew
the value of
helping the police and were under much pressure to engender favour with the
police.  Jody and Hayden were 17 and 15
respectively and believed they were in
considerable trouble and could receive stern punishment.  They were brought to
Griffith by
their mother to act as identifying witnesses.  They were aware that
their father had been brought to Griffith in custody for the
same purpose.<p>
<p>
Each of the Parkers probably felt under pressure to identify someone from the
group of photographs viewed;  they had been informed
that the group of
photographs contained a photograph or photographs of other people whom police
believed (and probably said) were
involved.  Calabria complained that the
procedures adopted by the police precluded any monitoring of them on his
behalf.<p>
<p>
Calabria relied on the police failing to seek identification from Leslie Roy
Holmes, Judith Anne Holmes and Joan Elizabeth Parker
whom it is claimed were
just as well placed as the Parkers.  On the materials it seems that the three
witnesses mentioned may not
have been quite as well placed as Jody and Hayden.
They may not have made the same observations.<p>
<p>
Calabria emphasised that Parker had stated that Calabria was "possibly" one of
the investors - possibly the man in the towelling
hat who came to the property.
Calabria submitted Parker's partial and inadequate identification should not
have been placed before
the jury.  Calabria complained that along with the
positive identification given by Jody and Hayden a jury could never be
adequately
or effectively directed as to the dangers of relying upon the
evidence of Parker.<p>
<p>
This is to do less than justice to the understanding, skill and common sense of
the jury.  Juries deal with evidence similar to that
of Parker frequently.  Nor
do I think that there was any danger of the jury running the evidence
together.<p>
<p>
Notwithstanding all the points made on Calabria's behalf there was no lack of
probity.  The probative value was not outweighed by
the prejudicial effect.
Each of the Parkers was under pressure.  Parker resisted it in that he was
unable to identify Rizzotto and
his identification of Calabria was tentative.
Jody and Hayden had had time to observe Calabria and it is not easy to accept
that,
because of that pressure and anxiety, they would have identified somebody
whom they had not seen involved at the crop site and at
meetings in the
neighbourhood or that they would have been tempted to identify someone about
whom they were not reasonably sure.
 Hayden was under lesser pressure.<p>
The judge held, after inspecting the photographs, that they were unexceptional
and while not of professional quality they clearly
displayed the features of
the persons depicted and although they were persons of different ages they were
of persons of such overall
similarity that in the judge's opinion the showing
of them to the Parkers was by no means unfair to the accused.  The judge relied
on <u>R v. Segar</u>, unreported, CCA 9 February 1994.<p>
<p>
The judge was satisfied from the evidentiary materials that each of the Parkers
had ample opportunity to observe those involved in
the crop cultivation and
that their identification of Calabria as being one of those persons was
sufficiently reliable for the jury
to act upon it.  In retrospect, it would
have been better if the judge had distinguished the evidence of the sons from
that of the
father.  The sons' evidence was sufficiently reliable for the jury
to act upon it.  The father's evidence was less persuasive and
amounted to
Calabria being possibly one of the investors.<p>
<p>
The judge held correctly that it was appropriate for the identification
evidence of all three witnesses to be placed before the jury.<p>
<p>
<u>Separate Trial</u><p>
<u></u>It appears from the trial judge's reasons of 31 May 1994 that Calabria
sought a separate trial based on the assumption that certain
tapes of telephone
conversations might be admitted against Rizzotto and Prochilo but not against
him.  Calabria submitted that incurable
prejudice would flow through onto him.
The judge applied the correct principles and his exercise of discretion could
not be successfully
challenged.  Further, the flow of events was not as counsel
anticipated.<p>
<p>
Counsel for Calabria reframed his submission.  Counsel submitted that having
regard to the evidence which was erroneously admitted
at the joint trial it was
unfair and that, in retrospect, there should have been separate trials.
Counsel relied on a number of reasons.<p>
<p>
Calabria supported the submission that the identification evidence of Jody and
of Hayden as to Rizzotto should have been rejected.
 It was highly prejudicial
and likely to persuade the jury to convict Rizzotto.  At the joint trial
evidence common to both was led
in an attempt to prove separately that each was
guilty.  There was evidence of association and of guilty association, including
the
four intercepted telephone conversations between Rizzotto and Calabria, the
evidence as to the utility, the length of their relationship
(friends for 25
years) and the admission that he was in dialogue with Rizzotto before those
telephone conversations and Calabria
being alerted to Rizzotto's nephew being
associated with some illicit crop.<p>
<p>
Calabria submitted that the combined effect of all the evidence (both
admissible and that which was admitted erroneously) would ensure
Rizzotto's
conviction and lead on to Calabria's conviction because their association would
be seen as a guilty one.  If the identification
evidence had been excluded as
contended the jury would have obtained a different perspective.  The case
against Rizzotto would be
thin to non existent.  The association between
Rizzotto and Calabria would not appear to be a guilty one.  The jury would not
be
tempted to say Rizzotto is guilty, Rizzotto and Calabria were closely
associated and in this cultivation together and Calabria is
guilty.<p>
<p>
Calabria submitted that it would be unrealistic to expect a jury to separate
out the evidence against each man.  He claimed that
there was a real risk that
a jury which heard the Rizzotto evidence would let that colour its approach
towards Calabria and automatically
treat the association between Rizzotto and
Calabria as a guilty one.  There was a risk of the jury not being able to view
that evidence
objectively and realise that the association was capable of being
an innocent one and that this was a reasonable possibility.<p>
<p>
It was further submitted that the erroneous receipt of the Rizzotto
identification evidence had the effect of shoring up the evidence
of Jody and
Hayden as against Calabria.  Calabria attacked the reliability and credibility
of Jody and Hayden.  He submitted that
their evidence against Calabria was
strengthened by their evidence against Rizzotto.  His nephew was found at the
crop with a gun
and there were other telephone conversations connecting
Rizzotto to his nephew.<p>
<p>
I have earlier indicated that the Rizzotto identification evidence was
correctly admitted.  However, the point as to separate trials
still remains.<p>
<p>
The identification exercises as to Rizzotto and Calabria differed both as to
manner and point of time although in both instances
photographs were used.  The
Griffith exercise was distinct.  It would not be difficult for any jury to
separate them.<p>
<p>
Nor do I think it would be difficult for a jury to keep separate the tapes of
conversations between Rizzotto and Calabria on the
one hand and Rizzotto and
Rocco, his nephew on the other hand.<p>
<p>
There were differences which helped to keep the two cases separate in the
jury's mind.  Calabria was based a little out of Griffith
and conducted a farm.
Rizzotto was based in Sydney (Smithfield) and conducted a service station.  His
nephew was at Mt Grenfell station.<p>
<p>
Both Rizzotto and Calabria challenged the reliability and credibility of Jody
and Hayden.  Both were alleged to be suspect witnesses
because of their own
actions and interests.  Some of their observations of Rizzotto and Calabria
occurred on the same occasions.
 On the identification issue where the key was
the nature, extent and length of the observations of Jody and Hayden it was
highly
probable that the jury would be satisfied that they had seen both or
neither.  This was not a case where there was a risk of impermissible
shoring
up.<p>
<p>
Viewed overall this was not a case where there should have been separate trials
or where there has been an injustice arising out
of the joint trial.<p>
<p>
This ground of appeal fails.<p>
<p>
<u>Admission Of Tapes</u><p>
Calabria in his grounds of appeal contended that the judge erred in admitting
into evidence the tape recording and translation of
intercepted telephone
conversations (exhibit 34, tapes 312 and 341; exhibit 34A, tapes 55 and 1165;
exhibit 35, tapes 496, 525, 637
(or 647) and 783 and exhibit 1D, tapes 515,
518, 636) as evidence of common purpose.<p>
<p>
Counsel for Calabria did not press this ground.  The reasons given in relation
to Rizzotto's appeal as to a similar ground would
apply.<p>
<p>
Counsel for Calabria did not press the ground that the judge erred in his
directions to the jury on the application of the doctrine
of common purpose and
on the complicity of the accused with each other and others in the commission
of the offence.  Nor did counsel
for Calabria press the ground that the judge
erred in failing to adequately direct the jury relating to the evidence of
prior inconsistent
statements of Parker, Jody and Hayden.<p>
<p>
<u>Accomplice</u><p>
<u></u>It was conceded by the Crown that Parker, Jody and Holmes were
accomplices.  The Crown contended that Hayden was not an accomplice
whereas the
accused contended that he was.  Prochilo conceded that the question should be
left to the jury.<p>
<p>
Calabria complained that the judge erred by directing the jury that it was open
to them to find that Hayden was not an accomplice
of Calabria or Rizzotto and
that if they so found it would not be dangerous for them to act upon his
evidence alone and that as a
matter of law it was not then necessary for them
to look for corroboration.<p>
<p>
Calabria submitted that it was beyond argument that Hayden was an accomplice
and that the judge should have so directed them.  He
should not have canvassed
the question and told the jury that if the Crown had negatived that Hayden was
an accomplice, corroboration
did not have to be sought.<p>
<p>
In support of his submission Calabria relied on Hayden Parker admitting:<p>
<p>
(a)	he was interrogated (by formal record of interview) along with his father,
Jody and others;<p>
(b)	he believed he was in a great deal of trouble and expected to face
charges;<p>
(c)	he was in the company variously of his brother, his father and other
workers and investors;<p>
(d)	he knew the nature of the investors' role what they were doing there;<p>
(e)	he was aware of the cannabis crop being grown and it being planted, tended
and guarded;<p>
(f)	he sold his SKK rifle for cash to one of the investors who included
Calabria, Rizzotto and Prochilo, they being present.  Hayden
told his father
what was happening and of the desire by the men to purchase two further such
rifles for use by other men and gave
the moneys which he had received to his
father.<p>
<p>
Calabria submitted that it was established that Rocco Rizzotto thereafter
carried one of these weapons around the property whilst
working.  He was seen
carrying an SKK rifle around the property.<p>
<p>
There was the general material of Hayden living and working on the station and
seeing what was taking place, the meetings and the
men tending the crop and
speaking with them and the investors.  Hayden seems to have been on the fringe
of the meetings.  He did
not take part in them.  He accompanied Mr Holmes when
he took two of the workers into Cobar to make a telephone call.  He saw the
plane fly overhead and the reactions of the men and of his father.  Hayden
stated that he did not receive anything from the crop.
 He got on with chores
around the house.  Hayden did not give evidence of laying the pipes or tending
the crop.  He was present at
meetings and observed what was happening on the
property.  He denied that he was working on the plantation or worked on it from
time
to time.  He agreed that he did some things in respect of it.  (This was
not explored).  Hayden agreed that apart from meetings,
he was in the company
of Fred (Calabria) on the plantation or on some other part of the property from
time to time and spoke to him.<p>
<p>
Parker said that Hayden helped to pull up the pipes and remove the irrigation
equipment.  Parker said that his son got dragged in
by somebody else and that
he asked his sons to destroy not to help.  This led to a lively argument
whether this was aiding or encouraging
or participating in the cultivation of
the plantation or the reverse.<p>
<p>
At one stage during cross examination by counsel for Prochilo Parker stated
that it could be said that he involved his sons in the
cultivation of
marijuana.  No further details were elicited.  This was the father's opinion.<p>
<p>
The evidence of Jody as to Hayden's exact role is not of great help.  It
established Hayden's presence on the property and his presence
at various times
when conferences took place but not his participation. <p>
<p>
The judge summarised the evidence of Parker, Jody and Hayden in considerable
detail.  The jury were fully seized of it.<p>
<p>
The judge explained to the jury that there was a dispute whether Hayden was an
accomplice but not as to Holmes, Parker and Jody.
 The judge told the jury that
it was necessary for the Crown to negative that Hayden was an accomplice and to
do so beyond reasonable
doubt.  The judge explained (SU187A) that for the jury
to classify Hayden as an accomplice they would have to be satisfied, firstly,
that the crime of cultivating a commercial cannabis crop was being committed at
Mt Grenfell Station between November 1990 and March
1991, secondly, that during
that time Hayden was present and, thirdly, that he intentionally gave either
aid or encouragement to
those involved in the commission of the crime.  The
judge continued that there was no contest as to the first and second elements,
there being ample evidence establishing these.  The contest was as to the third
element.  The judge explained that the Crown contended
that there was no
evidence to establish that Hayden intentionally gave either aid or
encouragement to those involved in the cultivation
of the crop whereas the
accused stated that the evidence did establish that Hayden aided and encouraged
his brother, his father,
Les Holmes and the other men whom he knew were working
on the crop.  He knew Rocco, Ralph and Tony and he was involved in the
cultivation
of the crop.<p>
<p>
As to the rifle incident, the Crown contended that selling a rifle when
prevailed upon to do so is not taking part in the cultivation.
 The appellant
contended that the rifle was obviously being sold to enable the plantation to
be guarded.<p>
<p>
The judge referred the jury to the evidence which bore upon what Hayden did and
said and whether he was an accomplice.  The judge
directed the jury to look at
that evidence not in isolation but in the context of all the evidence of those
who were there at the
time and had given evidence in those proceedings.  The
judge reminded the jury that the Crown had to negative that Hayden was an
accomplice.  He also reminded them that the Crown said that it had negatived
that Hayden was an accomplice and that the accused said
it had not been
negatived and that they would find Hayden was an accomplice in those
circumstances.<p>
<p>
It would have been clearer if the judge had told the jury that the Crown had to
negative that Hayden was an accomplice and that this
meant that if they had a
reasonable doubt whether he was an accomplice they should proceed on the basis
that Hayden was an accomplice.
 Alternatively, it could have been put that if
the jury thought there was a reasonable possibility that Hayden was an
accomplice
they should proceed on that basis.  However, I think that what the
judge said suffices.  He twice made the point that the Crown had
to negative
that Hayden was an accomplice.  On a third occasion he referred to the jury
being "satisfied that Hayden was not an accomplice".
 He isolated the point in
dispute and related the law to the facts.<p>
<p>
The judge explained the significance of a witness being an accomplice.  He
warned the jury that it was dangerous to convict a person
on the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice.<p>
<p>
At SU195A the judge stated that if they determined that Hayden was an
accomplice there was evidence capable of corroborating his
evidence and that if
they were satisfied that Hayden was not an accomplice then his evidence could
be used by them to corroborate
the evidence of Parker, Jody and Holmes.<p>
<p>
Counsel for Calabria contended that the judge's directions were wrong and
misleading with serious consequences.  The jury were not
entitled to use the
evidence of Hayden as evidence corroborating each of Parker, Jody and Holmes.
Further, the jury was invited to
ignore the need to look for corroborative
evidence of Hayden.<p>
<p>
It was for the jury to decide what evidence of Parker, Jody, Hayden and Holmes
should be accepted what should be rejected and what
gave rise to a reasonable
doubt.  The same considerations apply to Calabria's evidence.<p>
<p>
It was open to the jury to take the view that Hayden's presence was explained.
The station was his home.  A 15 year old boy would
be curious if not fascinated
by what was happening.  However, a jury may have thought that the evidence,
which lacked detail and
depth fell far short of Hayden encouraging his father,
his brother, Holmes or any of the others.  Similarly they may have thought
it
fell far short of aiding.  There was no evidence of Hayden helping with the
crop or tending it.  In the absence of real evidence
of Hayden working on the
plantation (and with evidence to the contrary) and with such evidence as
existed being sparse and lacking
cogency and detail and the difficulty of
envisaging a 15 year old boy intentionally aiding and encouraging the
experienced older
men and there being little to no evidence of such aid and
encouragement it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt
that Hayden was not an accomplice.  It was a question for the jury to decide.
The judge was right to leave the issue to the
jury.<p>
<p>
In any event, it is hard to see how leaving that issue to the jury results in a
miscarriage.  If the evidence of Hayden being an
accomplice was as strong as
Calabria suggested, the jury would not have been satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that Hayden was not
an accomplice.  Nor do I think that leaving that
issue would have distracted the jury.  Juries are capable of deciding whether
the
Crown had negatived that Hayden was an accomplice and then, depending on
that decision, moving on to the next stage.  If they had
decided that the Crown
had not negatived that Hayden was an accomplice, the jury would then have
further considered Hayden's evidence
and any supporting or corroborative
evidence.  The judge made the position clear.<p>
<p>
Calabria further complained that the judge's explanations of an accomplice were
flawed and that he used a faulty mechanism by simply
referring to the Crown's
arguments and the accused's arguments.  Calabria further complained that the
jury would have gathered that
the judge did not think Hayden was an accomplice.
There was further complaint that the judge should have directed the jury as to
aspects of the evidence to be considered in determining the issue.<p>
<p>
These complaints do less than justice to the Summing Up.  I have earlier
indicated that the judge explained what an accomplice was
and isolated the
issue to be decided.  He gave adequate references to the important evidence on
the issue in dispute and read parts
of it as requested by the accused.  He
summarised the competing arguments.  The jury was left with a clear statement
of the issue
in dispute, the relevant principles and evidence and the competing
arguments.  The jury knew what they had to decide.  The jury may
have gathered
that the judge was less than impressed with the cogency of some of the
materials on which the accused relied.  Those
were difficulties in the
evidence.  The judge was careful to leave the issue to the jury to decide and
his observations were well
within permissible bounds.<p>
<p>
The judge returned to the question whether Hayden was an accomplice at SU
237-239.  Amongst other things he set out the accuseds'
arguments that Hayden
was an accomplice.  The judge recapitulated the position.  The judge told the
jury that even if they were satisfied
that Hayden was not an accomplice his
position was different from those of the other non-accomplice witnesses.  The
judge referred
to Hayden's close affinity with his father and his brother and
stated that if the jury was satisfied that Hayden was not an accomplice
they
should still scrutinise his evidence most carefully before deciding whether to
act upon it.<p>
<p>
The relevant issues were put to the jury.  They were warned that even if Hayden
were not an accomplice his evidence still had to
be scrutinised most carefully.
The jury would have appreciated this as a matter of common sense and the
judge's direction would have
underlined the point.<p>
<p>
There has been no error and no miscarriage of justice.  This ground of appeal
fails.<p>
<p>
<u>Corroboration</u><p>
Calabria submitted that the judge failed to direct the jury adequately as to
how they should approach the evidence capable of amounting
to corroboration.
Counsel submitted that if a witness is an accomplice the judge must remind the
jury of the evidence capable of
corroborating that witness' account.  That
evidence must be collected, described and reviewed.  Counsel submitted:<p>
<p>
"If it is a movable feast at the behest of an intervening determination by the
jury he is never in the position to properly and forcefully
direct the jury
that such evidence is, will, or will not amount to corroboration."<p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>In practice there are on occasions disputes whether a witness is an
accomplice and they have to be resolved.<p>
<p>
The witness may emphatically deny any involvement.  He may say that he urged
the accused not to do the prohibited acts.  The accused
or other witnesses may
paint a picture of involvement or aiding or encouraging.  The jury has to
resolve the issue whether the Crown
has negatived that the witness was an
accomplice.  If the Crown fails to do so, the jury considers the judge's
directions as to corroboration.<p>
<p>
The judge (SU194) explained that it was the experience of the Courts that the
evidence of accomplices is often unreliable and that
it was dangerous to
convict a person on the evidence of an accomplice unless there was
corroboration of that person's evidence. 
The judge stated several times that
corroboration means evidence from other than the accomplice which they believe
and which significantly
confirms that the crime was committed and that the
accused committed it.<p>
<p>
The judge explained that he would identify the evidence which was capable of
corroborating Parker, Jody and Holmes and if necessary,
Hayden.  The judge
stated:<p>
<p>
"I am required to tell you what material ... is capable of amounting to
corroboration ...It will then be for you as judges of the
facts to decide,
first, if you accept that material and, secondly, if you do, whether you
consider it does confirm the alleged accomplice's
account in a material way by
tending to show not simply that the offence was committed but that it was the
accused who committed
it."<p>
<p>
Words to similar effect were used on other occasions in the summing up.  The
judge then identified the material which was capable
of amounting to
corroboration.  He referred to tapes of the telephone intercepts and the Crown
contention that they meant that each
of the appellants were involved, the sale
by Mr Osborne of an SKK rifle to Parker and Rocco Rizzotto being in possession
of that
rifle and the sighting by Jody of the light blue Ford utility if that
had been established beyond reasonable doubt.  The judge pointed
out that the
Crown also relied on the evidence of Hayden, if the jury concluded that he was
not an accomplice.  The judge stated
that one accomplice could not corroborate
the evidence of another accomplice.<p>
<p>
The judge stated that the Crown relied on the lies allegedly told by Rizzotto
as to his relationship with Calabria and the lie allegedly
told by Calabria
that he had not communicated with Rizzotto for a long time.  The judge gave
lengthy directions as to lies (SU199-203)
and explained when lies could be used
as corroboration.<p>
<p>
The judge returned to corroboration at SU239.  He repeated his general
directions and reminded the jury of the evidence capable of
amounting to
corroboration.  The judge summarised the arguments of the accused as to each of
the pieces of evidence relied upon as
capable of amounting to corroboration and
why such pieces of evidence should not be regarded as amounting to
corroboration.  For
example, the accused contended that the telephone
conversations were innocent and established nothing.<p>
<p>
In my opinion the judge dealt adequately with the issue of corroboration.  He
gave correct directions of law, he explained the position
of Hayden, he
referred sufficiently to the evidence capable of amounting to corroboration and
how it could be used and he summarised
the arguments of the Crown and the
accused.<p>
<p>
Calabria's complaints as to corroboration were linked in largely to the judge
leaving it to the jury to decide whether Hayden was
an accomplice.  It was
contended that this weakened the effect of the directions as to corroboration.
I do not agree.  From the extensive
coverage of the topic the jury would have
understood the dangers of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice and
would have appreciated the need to consider carefully the pieces
of evidence capable of amounting to corroboration.  The jury would
have also
understood the special position in relation to Hayden.<p>
<p>
Given the plantation, the relationship between Calabria and Rizzotto and that
between the latter and his nephew, the tapes of the
telephone conversations
were less than helpful to the appellants and capable of being regarded as
powerful corroboration.<p>
<p>
This ground of appeal fails.<p>
<p>
<u>Alleged Unsafe And Unsatisfactory Verdict</u><p>
<u></u>Calabria submitted that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory.  He
relied upon the arguments advanced on behalf of Rizzotto but
making all
necessary changes to make those arguments appropriate to Calabria's case.<p>
<p>
Again, I have made my own independent assessment of the evidence.<p>
<p>
Little weight should be put upon the identification evidence of Parker.  That
evidence would not sustain a conviction.  Despite Jody
and Hayden not being
shown the photographs until 9 May 1991 and the limitations upon photographic
identification each had considerable
opportunities to observe Calabria for
substantial periods.  In, around and near the remote Mt Grenfell Station there
were unlikely
to be many people.  There was not much room for confusion.  Both
sons would, however, have felt that they were under pressure to
assist the
authorities.<p>
<p>
There was corroborative material apart from the utility which could be regarded
as being of considerable weight.  I would have attached
little weight to the
evidence about the utility given that only one photograph of it was shown.  It
is hard to explain away the terms
of the telephone calls and the lies.<p>
<p>
This was a hard fought trial in which every point was taken.  Matters were
generally covered in considerable detail.<p>
<p>
There was ample evidence of quality on which a jury could safely convict.  I
would have been surprised if the jury had not convicted.<p>
<p>
This ground of appeal fails.<p>
<p>
The remaining grounds of appeal were not pressed.  There was general reliance
placed on the submissions made on behalf of Rizzotto.<p>
<p>
This appeal should be dismissed.<p>
<p>
<u>Appeals Against Sentence</u><p>
There was evidence that the value of the cannabis crop was of the order of $8
million.  The judge did not proceed on this figure
but he was satisfied that
the crop was "worth a great deal of money measured in the millions of dollars."
He found that a great portion
of the crop had matured or was well on the way to
maturing about 11 March 1991.  Some of the crop had been harvested and placed
in
bags.  Other plants were in the process of being harvested and dried prior
to the leaf being stripped from the plants.<p>
<p>
The judge made these further findings:<p>
(a)	Each of the appellants attended at the crop site on a number of occasions
and played a significant role with others in making
decisions as to the
cultivation of that crop following its planning;<p>
(b)	Calabria was one of the persons involved in the selection of the crop
site;<p>
(c)	Rizzotto was one of the first persons, if not the first person, to be
advised by one of the labourers on the site that the crop
had begun to mature
and that he told Calabria "in order to make arrangements, it would seem to
dispose of the crop following its
harvest."<p>
<p>
The appellants submitted that the judge erred in the process he used to arrive
at the respective roles of the applicant and the other
participants in the
offence.<p>
<p>
The materials established the active involvement of each of the appellants at
the decision making level.  Rizzotto's nephew kept
Rizzotto appraised of the
progress of the crop.  Rizzotto was in touch with Calabria.  The inference is
that both were involved at
least in the preliminary planning as to its
disposal.<p>
<p>
From the evidence of Parker it appears that Frank Barbaro was a powerful
influence.  He needed money and insisted that the crop proceed.
 His threat to
tell the police about Parker and leave him responsible solely had its effect as
did the attendance of the men early
the following morning.<p>
<p>
The judge found correctly that Rizzotto had attended at the site on not less
than two occasions.  The judge rejected submissions
that Rizzotto's criminality
was no greater than some of those who laboured on the site and much less than
those more fully involved
with the crop.  The judge thought that Rizzotto
intended to be fully involved in the distribution of the crop as it was
harvested.
 The judge, who relied heavily on the telephone conversations, found
that Rizzotto's criminality was of the highest order.  While
I would agree that
Rizzotto's criminality was of a high order I would not assess it as being of
the highest order on the evidence
in this case.  I doubt if it was as high as
that of Barbaro.<p>
<p>
Rizzotto was born on 17 September 1932.  He was a family man with strong family
ties.  He had been in business on his own account
for many years and was well
regarded in his local general community and his local business community.  For
many years prior to the
offence he had been a person of exemplary character.
The judge disregarded some relatively minor matters which had occurred long
ago
and treated Rizzotto as entitled to a discount because of his previous good
character.  The judge was satisfied that this was
an isolated offence and out
of character and assumed that greed overcame Rizzotto.  It was highly unlikely
that he would involve
himself in this type of criminal conduct again.<p>
<p>
The judge accepted that Rizzotto had chronic health problems.  He had been a
diabetic since 1979 and this condition needed continuing
control and the
observation of a strict regime.<p>
<p>
As to Calabria the judge accepted the evidence of Jody which he regarded
highly.  The judge found that Calabria was one of those
who attended and
selected the crop site and that he attended there on a number of occasions and
participated with others in making
decisions as to the cultivation of the crop.
From the taped conversations the judge was satisfied that Calabria was about to
become
involved in the sale and distribution of the crop.  The judge found that
Calabria's criminality was of the highest order.  I agree
that it was high.
Again I would query whether it was as high as that of Barbaro.<p>
<p>
Calabria was born on 8 May 1938.  He resided with his wife and three of his
children on his farm.  He had strong family ties.  He
had been an industrious
and law abiding citizen.  He was highly regarded by the general community and
the farming community and prior
to the offence was a person of exemplary
character.  He was entitled to a discount for his good character.  It was an
isolated offence
and out of character.  It was highly unlikely that he would
ever offend again.<p>
He had a chronic health problem.  He was suffering from hypertension with mild
diabetes and a chronic gastric ulcer with elevated
uric acid.  There were other
minor problems which could be treated.  Two of his children had physical and
medical conditions which
would make them dependent on his farm for their
livelihood for the rest of their lives.<p>
<p>
The judge was satisfied that the criminality of Rizzotto and Calabria was
greater than that of any of the others involved.  This
finding was attacked and
I will return to it.<p>
<p>
The judge would have imposed sentences of 12 years had it not been for each's
good character.  The judge found that there were special
circumstances
comprising their health, their previous good character, they being unlikely to
re-offend and their need for counselling
and supervision for 31/2 years upon
release.<p>
<p>
Counsel for the appellants contended that the sentences imposed were
disproportionate and excessive compared with those imposed upon
the other
offenders involved in the plantation.<p>
<p>
The Crown has helpfully supplied the following schedule of sentences for the
co-offenders.<p>
<p>
It is to be noted that all pleaded guilty, albeit Barbaro's plea was after a
Sentence Indication.  The Crown's appeal against Barbaro's
sentence was
dismissed by this Court on 14 February 1995.  This Court held that the sentence
upon Barbaro was manifestly inadequate.
 The Court declined to intervene
because of the combination of circumstances detailed on pages 11-13 of my
judgment.  A highly unusual
position had arisen.<p>
<p>
The Crown submitted that the sentences were not excessive in themselves nor
disproportionate to the other sentences.  It contended
that there were three
levels of criminality, ground level involving contributions of labour or
property, that is, Kevin Parker, Rocco
Rizzotto and Espositio; intermediate
level, involving presence at initial and subsequent discussions including
selection of crop
site and some work, that is Barbaro and Romeo; and the higher
level, that is, the higher executive level.<p>
<p>
The lower sentence of Kevin Parker is due to his co-operation with the police,
and giving evidence.  Rocco Rizzotto and Esposito
pleaded guilty to supply
charges as well as cultivation charges.  Romeo pleaded guilty to the lesser
charge of cultivation of not
more than 250 plants.  He and Barbaro both had
poor records.<p>
<p>
The Crown relied on <u>R v. Demaine</u>, unreported, CCA, 23 March 1993.  There
were four offences of supplying cannabis leaf, one of which involved a
commercial quantity
slightly in excess of 66 kilograms.  That carried a maximum
penalty of 15 years.  There was also an offence of cultivation of a large
commercial quantity of cannabis plants which carried a maximum penalty of 20
years.<p>
<p>
Premises were leased from which to market the drug in Sydney.  $205,000 in cash
was found in the prisoner's possession when much
of the crop remained to be
harvested and some of it was in the Sydney premises either awaiting sale or
being prepared for sale. 
It was described as "a major exercise in professional
crime."  Large profits were intended.<p>
<p>
The prisoner was 34 years old, had no prior convictions, pleaded guilty at the
earliest stage, gave assistance to the police, was
frank as to his own
involvement and one of his motives may at least initially have been to obtain
money for family members who were
in need.<p>
<p>
For the three offences of supplying a prohibited drug, Demaine was sentenced to
a fixed term of 2 years.  On the offence of supplying
a commercial quantity of
cannabis leaf and that of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis
plants he was sentenced on
each charge to a minimum term of five years and an
additional term of three years.  All sentences were to be served concurrently.
There were also forfeiture orders.<p>
<p>
<u>Demaine</u> is a limited guide.  Rizzotto and Calabria face no supply
charges.  Nor is there any evidence of either of them having received large
amounts of cash.  They hoped to receive substantial profits but they had not
eventuated.  The crop was destroyed.  The prohibited
drugs did not find their
way into the community.<p>
<p>
The subjective factors in each case were strong.  Both Rizzotto and Calabria
had been persons of good repute well regarded by their
communities.  Both men
had been industrious and good family men.  Their health and ages in 1994 (62
and 56) meant that gaol would
be difficult.<p>
<p>
I am unable to agree with the judge that their roles were greater than that of
Barbaro.  However, their criminality was high.  Each
was guilty of a very
serious offence.<p>
<p>
In my opinion there is an element of disproportion between the sentences
imposed upon the appellants and those of the other offenders.<p>
<p>
I have concluded that the sentences imposed were excessive.  I agree with the
judge that there were special circumstances and with
his nomination of them.
In my opinion each appellant should receive a sentence of 81/2 years, with a
minimum term of 5 years and
an additional term of 31/2 years.<p>
<p>
I propose the following orders:<p>
1.	Each appeal against conviction is dismissed.<p>
2.	Leave to each appellant to appeal against sentence.<p>
3.	Each appeal against sentence is allowed.  In lieu of the sentences imposed
each appellant is sentenced to 81/2 years penal servitude
comprising a minimum
term of 5 years commencing on 14 July 1994 and ending on 13 July 1999 and an
additional term of 31/2 years commencing
on 14 July 1999.<b> </b><p>

<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u>SIMPSON J</b>:  I have read in draft, and generally agree with, the
judgement of Smart J, but wish to express my own views in relation to the
grounds
of appeal concerning the inspection of the Ford utility by the jury,
and its impact, if any, upon the trial and verdicts.<p>
<p>
	The marijuana plantation was located on an isolated station in the far west of
New South Wales.   Both in his unsworn statement
at trial and in his record of
interview Rizzotto denied that he had ever been there.   In his record of
interview he told police
that he was the owner of a Ford utility, registered
number PEJ892, but that he never lent the vehicle (except on a couple of
occasions
for a short time to a nephew, and never overnight).   <p>
<p>
	A witness, Jody Parker, identified the appellant Rizzotto as one of a group of
people he had observed near the site of the plantation.
  The manner of this
identification is the subject of a different ground of appeal.   Jody Parker
also identified a vehicle depicted
in a photograph (exhibit 26), admittedly of
Rizzotto's vehicle, as one he had seen at a log cabin on the property.<p>
<p>
	Particularly in the light of Rizzotto's denials that he or his vehicle had
ever been to Cobar, or to the Mount Grenfell Station,
evidence placing the
utility in that location had the capacity to become a significant, though not
overwhelmingly so, plank in the
Crown's circumstantial case.<p>
<p>
	The challenge to Parker's identification of the vehicle  was based upon his
descriptions of the vehicle he had seen compared with
what were asserted to be
the real characteristics of Rizzotto's vehicle.   In other words, by
contrasting the descriptions given
by him with Rizzotto's actual vehicle, doubt
would be cast upon his evidence that the vehicle in the photograph was the
vehicle he
had seen at the site.<p>
<p>
	The first description of the vehicle given by Jody Parker was contained in a
record of interview he made with the police on 11 March
1991.   In that
interview he described  the utility as "blue" and "light blue", equipped with a
roo bar and spot lights that had
a yellow sticker on them.   He said the inside
of the tray was scratched when he looked in it, and the vehicle had a black
tarpaulin
on it.   The description he gave in the trial was of "a light blue
ford ute ...XF Ford ute, it had a black torno cover on it, it
had a roo bar and
spot lights... little square Navarra spot lights."   In his evidence in the
trial he made no mention of the scratches
in the tray, but he did say, in cross
examination, that he remembered the first three letters of the registration
plate.<p>
<p>
	On behalf of Rizzotto it was contended that the vehicle depicted in the
photograph exhibit 26 (his vehicle) was white, that his
car was registered as
white, and that other witnesses described it as white.   It was not, therefore,
the car that Parker had seen
at the plantation.   It was this that culminated
in the tender of Rizzotto's vehicle itself, in order to enable the jury to
decide
for itself whether Parker's identification of the vehicle in the
photograph as the vehicle he had seen at the log cabin could be
accepted.<p>
<p>
	At all times it was the colour of the vehicle that attracted the attention of
the parties.   No cross-examination was directed to
Parker's description of the
other identifying features he had mentioned.   So far as the scratch marks he
said he had seen in the
tray of the vehicle were concerned, the only evidence
that he had mentioned them in his record of interview emerged in
re-examination,
not of Parker himself, but of the police officer who had
interviewed him.   That part of Parker's answer was led from the detective,
but
in no more than a passing reference.   No application was made by any defence
counsel further to cross examine either the detective,
or Parker, on the
subject, and the matter slipped into obscurity.   No description of the
location, extent or nature of the scratches
was ever given.<p>
<p>
	This was a trial in which the evidence extended over twenty-nine days and
produced almost 900 pages of transcript, forty Crown and
sixteen defence
exhibits.   The evidence of scratching on the tray of the utility appears in
one single line of that material, and
was never agitated or explored by any
counsel.   It is not possible to say with certainty what matters were raised by
counsel in
their addresses, which appear to have been lengthy, but it is
unlikely that scratch marks were raised.   Scratching was not mentioned
as an
issue in the summing up, which itself occupied five days, and in which the
trial judge referred in detail to most of the evidence.<p>
<p>
	In these circumstances, it seems scarcely credible that any member of the jury
would have recalled, let alone focused upon, as a
matter determinative of any
issue, that single line in the evidence in which it was said that the tray of
the utility observed by
Jody Parker was scratched.<p>
<p>
	It is, in my view, necessary to have this clearly in mind in considering the
remaining matters raised in these grounds of appeal.
  Precisely what occurred
is not clear, but the narrative begins with the tender of Rizzotto's vehicle.
That occurred at the conclusion
of his extremely brief unsworn statement.   It
became exhibit R5.   At that time no limitation was asked for or placed upon,
the
use the jury might make of the exhibit.   What occurred immediately after
that concerned the means by which the jury could have access
to, and make their
own observations of, the vehicle.<p>
<p>
</center>	Arrangements were made for the jury to be taken to the basement car
park of the Downing Centre where they could view the vehicle
under artificial
light.   Arrangements were then made for the car, and the jury, to be taken to
the Darlinghurst Court complex where
they could observe it in natural light.
<p>
<p>
	The trial judge directed the jury:<p>
<p>
	"Members of the jury, exhibit R5 has now been located in the car park area
down underneath this complex.   I propose to have the
two officers who have
been looking after you sworn to be viewers, so you will be under their
jurisdiction, as it were, while you
were looking at it.   They are not there to
answer any questions, they are there just to accompany you down there <u>and
ensure that you twelve can have a good look at the vehicle</u>.   After lunch I
propose to have the vehicle taken up into an area where you can view the
vehicle in daylight too because it is in
a situation of artificial lighting at
the moment. ... I don't know how long you will want to look at the vehicle, it
is a matter
for you.   Rather than put any constraints upon you, after you have
viewed the vehicle, probably it will be close to 4 o'clock anyway
I would
expect ...  Officers, the court will now adjourn so you can take the jury to
the area where the vehicle is located and show
it to them <u>in such time as
they want</u>." (emphasis added)<p>
<p>
	On the following page the transcript discloses that, in the absence of the
jury the trial judge notified the parties in the following
terms:<p>
<p>
	"I had a request from the jury to look inside the car and under the bonnet, I
didn't allow that request.   It seems to me that the
issue here is the external
appearance of the vehicle, nothing else, nothing more.   Does everyone agree
with that?"<p>
<p>
	This was followed by an indication that counsel agreed with the course taken
by his Honour.<p>
<p>
	Later on the same day, after the case for the appellant Calabria and the Crown
case in reply, his Honour addressed some remarks
to the jury about what was
then to occur.   He added:<p>
<p>
	"I did receive a request from you to look at the interior of the vehicle and
under the hood of the vehicle.   As I understand it,
the evidence in this case
relates to the external appearance of that car.   I do not think there is any
need to look under the hood
or interior.   That is the only observation I want
to make at this stage.   If there is a reason that you want to do something by
all means write me a note and let me know and I will discuss it with counsel
and we will come to an answer in regard to that matter."
(T880)<p>
<p>
	His Honour then advised the jury that the motor vehicle would be available to
them at any time if they wanted to have another look
at it.   <p>
<p>
	The jury returned with verdicts of guilty on 13 July 1994.   Following the
short adjournment on that day senior counsel for Rizzotto
brought to the
attention of the judge information that had been communicated to him to the
effect that during the course of their
deliberations the jury had asked to
inspect the tray of the vehicle and that they had been permitted to do so, but
that neither their
request nor its approval had been communicated to counsel.
There followed an exchange between senior counsel and the judge, some
of which
has been extracted  in the judgment of Smart J.   Those exchanges do not, in
terms, confirm that what occurred was as outlined
by senior counsel.   In this
Court evidence was admitted to the effect that, during the course of their
deliberations the jury had
requested a further opportunity to view the vehicle
and this opportunity was provided without opposition.   This, no doubt, is a
reference to the event that gave rise to the direction given at p.880 of the
transcript, extracted above.<p>
<p>
	It is what next occurred that is unclear.   The initial evidence, at least as
far as this Court is concerned, appears in an affidavit
sworn by Tony Paul
Rizzotto, the son of the appellant Rizzotto, on 4 August 1994.   Relevantly, he
deposed that on 13 July 1994,
following inspection of the vehicle by the jury a
sheriff's officer said to him:<p>
<p>
	"When you pick up the vehicle have a look in the back to make sure everything
is as it was because the jury had a look."<p>
<p>
	The clear suggestion was made that this had in fact happened, and had happened
following communication with the trial judge through
his associate, who
conveyed the judge's approval to that course.   But there was no direct
evidence to this effect.   At the hearing
of the appeal the Crown produced the
sheriff's officer, Robert Alan Brown.   He said that he had communicated with
the judge's associate
prior to the view.   His evidence was in the following
terms:<p>
<p>
	"I asked the judge's associate whether the jury could look anywhere they
wished and she - I understand that she checked with the
judge and from his
response via her, she said that they could look wherever they wished.   I was
not aware of any restrictions."<p>
<p>
	He was unable to say whether any member of the jury had in fact removed or
looked under the tarpaulin or cover on the tray.   Nor
did he recall any such
request from the jury.   His only explanation for having queried the associate
in the terms he did was his
inexperience in long criminal trials and his wish
to make sure that he knew what was to happen when he conducted the jury to
where
the vehicle was.<p>
<p>
	In my view, any communication between jury and judge concerning the trial,
including evidentiary matters (as distinct from the kind
of housekeeping
matters about which juries sometimes communicate with the judge) must be
brought to the attention of the parties.
  <b><u>R  v  Yuill</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34
NSWLR 179</a> at 190.   For any such communication on an evidentiary matter to
occur and not be conveyed to counsel is capable of constituting
to an
irregularity in the trial.   That is not to say that this occurred in this
trial.   I do not think the evidence does establish
that such a communication
was made, but I am content to deal with these grounds of appeal on the
assumption that some event of the
king alleged occurred.   I am, however, far
from persuaded that any such request was <u>for the purpose</u> of examining
the interior of the tray, or, even if it were, that the purpose of that
examination was to search for scratch marks.<p>
<p>
	Whatever directions the jury had been given about the basis on which the
vehicle had been admitted into evidence, once it became
an exhibit, and subject
only to specific limitations on its admission, they were entitled to make what
use of it they considered
appropriate.   As I have said above, I consider it
highly unlikely that any member of the jury saw the scratch marks as the, or
an,
issue.   It is only necessary to ask:  what would they have looked for?
Large or small scratch marks?   In what number?   On what
parts of the tray?
Had they found scratch marks, how could they have used them to confirm or
corroborate Parker's identification?
  A jury should not be treated as having
no powers of reasoning of their own.   Parker saw a (or the) utility at the
station in about
mid February 1991.   The jury observed the utility on 27 June,
and again on 13 July, 1994.   They could hardly have overlooked the
possibility
that any damage which did appear to the tray of the utility had occurred in the
intervening time.   Nor could they have
overlooked the use to which utilities
are commonly put and the consequent likelihood of scratch marks in all, most,
or at least some,
such vehicles.<p>
<p>
	Further, it is not without relevance that, in this Court, there was no
evidence to establish the actual condition of the tray as
at the time of the
inspections in 1994.   For all this Court knows, there may have been no
scratching at all, a result which would
have led to an inference favourable to
the accused.   No reason was advanced why this Court should assume that
inspection of the
tray, if it occurred, would have revealed material damaging
to the appellants' cases.<p>
<p>
The test where an irregularity is shown to have occurred in a trial is as
stated by Smart J.   Can the court be satisfied that the
irregularity did not
affect the verdict, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if
the irregularity had not occurred?
  (<b><u>R  v  Marsland,</u></b> unreported,
Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 July 1991;   <b><u>R  v  Rudkowski,</u></b>
unreported, CCA, 15 December 1992;   <b><u>R  v  Domican No.3</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2046%20A%20Crim%20R%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 46
A Crim R 428</a>;   <b><u>R  v  Lansdell</u></b>, unreported CCA, 22 May 1995.)<p>
<p>
I am not persuaded that any irregularity occurred, but if it did, I am quite
satisfied that it did not affect the verdicts.<p>
<p>
In other respects I agree with the reasons for, and the orders proposed by,
Smart J.<p>
