<b>v. KATHRYN JOHNSTONE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These proceedings were brought to this court by way of stated case from the
decision of a magistrate sitting in the Local Court
under the Local Court
(Civil Claims) Act 1970.
<P>

2	The stated case contains in paragraph 1 a description of the issue that has
brought the matter here, in particular that in proceedings
against an insurer,
the defendant in the lower court and the plaintiff in the proceedings before
me, a claim has been made for damages
arising from a refusal to indemnify the
plaintiff in that court, the defendant in the proceedings before me, in respect
of the loss
of a motor vehicle which had allegedly been stolen and abandoned
having been burned out.
<P>

3	In those proceedings, which have not yet or had not yet as at the date of the
learned magistrate's determination, which is in
question before me, been set
down for hearing, the insurer sought to amend its defences.  It was partially
successful before the
learned magistrate.  That its success was only partial is
what has brought us here.
<P>

4	There was sought as well as the amendment the magistrate granted, an
amendment which would have permitted the raising of defences
under the
Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a>, which might effectively be described as defences
relying on material non-disclosure and, in particular, a defence that the
defendant
had failed to disclose to the insurer that her de facto husband had
been convicted of serious offences which might compendiously
be described as
relating to motor vehicles and also offences of dishonesty.
<P>

5	The learned magistrate, according to the stated case, determined that the
insurer should not have leave to amend its defence by
raising those defences,
notwithstanding the application to amend did not apprently appear to present or
to raise any real questions
of prejudice, notwithstanding that the application
does not appear to raise any question of inconvenience to the action by way of
its timing, but on the basis that the learned magistrate considered there was
no evidence which would establish that the defence
"would" succeed at a hearing
and, further, that what it was sought to raise was "irrelevant" to the issues
between the plaintiff
and the defendant.
<P>

6	It is contended that in the upshot the conceded discretion the learned
magistrate had to allow or refuse an amendment miscarried
on the basis that she
erred in principle, in particular, by failing to consider that if the matters
particularised and pleaded were
made out, a question arose of the legal
responsibility of the insurer to indemnify being affected by proper application
of the provisions
of the Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a> and, secondly, that she
further erred in principle by requiring evidence to establish the defence
before the application for amendment
would be granted, rather than allowing the
amendment to raise a defence which might then properly be determined on the
evidence at
the trial.
<P>

7	Interestingly, the defence as it was sought to be pleaded was defective.  So
much is conceded.  But that was not the ground for
disallowing the amendment.
In particular, the pleading failed, expressly, to assert the plaintiff's
knowledge of the relevant matters,
but these would undoubtedly be put to her in
cross-examination in her case when she is called to give evidence.  The
application
for amendment, however, sufficiently put her and her legal advisers
on notice of those matters and of the contention that they were
relevant.
Further, it was pleaded she had failed to disclose them.  In that sense, the
pleading implicitly but sufficiently raised
her ability to disclose the matters
which would have required her knowledge of them
<P>

8	It has not been suggested by the plaintiff's counsel that, as the pleading
stands, it fails to give adequate notice, though it
has been suggested that the
criminal record of a person not a party to the proceedings and not a party to
the substantial action
is legally irrelevant to its outcome and that the
pleading as it stands as such that the amendment should not be allowed and even
though it was disallowed on a different basis, it should not go back to the
magistrate.
<P>

9	Having analysed the issues in this fashion, I am of the view that  the stated
case must succeed.
<P>

10	In my view, her Worship erred in holding that she would not permit the
amendment in the absence of evidence establishing the
defence.  I am of the
view that her Worship erred in holding that the criminal record of the
plaintiff's de facto husband had to
be irrelevant.  She has mistaken the
purpose of amendment and the possible breadth of material non-disclosure.
<P>

11	There are circumstances - and I need not detail them in this judgment - in
which that record might be highly relevant so as to
support just such a defence
as is raised or sought to be raised under the Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a>, further,
it is not necessary to prove the defence before one be allowed to raise it.
<P>

12	The principles of modern procedure in relation to amendment are particularly
referred to by the High Court in <b>State of Queensland &amp; Anor v. J.L.
Holdings Pty. Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20141%20ALR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 141 ALR 353</a> and particularly in the joint
judgment of Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh, JJ. in the passages commencing at
p.356, ln.38 and through
to p.357, ln.40.
<P>

13	Kirby, J. in his separate judgment dealt with the modern case law on
amendment in a passage commencing at p.365 and concluding
at p.367.  At p.367,
ln.16 his Honour set out the modern approach in point form concluding at
p.371.
<P>

14	The principles have since oft been repeated in practice decisions and texts.
There is nothing in any of the principles therein
referred to which would
disclose any appropriate basis on which her Worship should have refused this
application.
<P>

15	One is driven to the conclusion that there has been an error of law and thus
the stated case should be upheld.
<P>

16	In regard to costs, correspondence between the legal representatives and
other communications have been tendered.  Suffice it
to say that the plaintiff
below, the defendant here, was sufficiently put on notice of a claim for costs,
unless some basis on which
a defence might properly be raised and pleaded was
agreed.
<P>

17	The pleading is less than ideal.  That is a matter which might well have
gone to costs except for this correspondence.  But in
the light of this
correspondence, it is perfectly plain that the plaintiff was not prepared to
accept any form of amendment which
might raise the defence and, in those
circumstances, I make an order for costs against her.
<P>

18	Notwithstanding, however, and having regard to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors Fund
Act 1951</a>, there being a successful appeal to a Supreme Court on the question of
law, I am prepared to grant a certificate under that section
in respect of this
appeal.
