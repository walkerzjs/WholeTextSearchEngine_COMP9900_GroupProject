<P>

	HER HONOUR  :  
<P>

1	This is an appeal under s 42 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered Clubs Act 1976</a></i> ("the
Act").   Such an appeal lies to this court on a question of law only.   The
subject of the appeal is the decision of Mr J Keating,
Licensing Magistrate of
28 January 1997.  In that decision Mr Keating declared the plaintiff, Anthony
Labbozzetta, ineligible for
a period of two years to stand for election to, or
hold office in the position of secretary or a member of the governing body of
the Club Marconi of Bossley Park social and Recreation and Sporting Centre
Limited (hereinafter referred to as "The Club"), or any
other club registered
under the Act.
<P>

	<b>The relevant legislation</b>
<P>

2	The long title of the Act includes the following:
<P>

	"An Act to make provision with respect to the registration of clubs and their
rules and management; ...
<P>

3	Division 1 of Part 2 is concerned with registration and provides for the
issue of certificates of registration in appropriate
circumstances by the
Licensing Court.   S 9A prescribes statutory conditions to which a certificate
is issued, and confers power
on the Licensing Court to impose additional
conditions.   S 10 comprehensively states requirements to be met by clubs.
Among these,
relevant for present purposes, are:
<P>

	"s. 10.  Requirements to be met by clubs
<P>

	(1)  For the purposes of sections 9 and 17 (1AA) (a), the requirements in
relation to a club are as follows:
<P>

	(i)  A member of the club, whether or not he is a member of the governing
body, or of any committee, of the club, shall not be
entitled, under the rules
of the club or otherwise, to derive, directly or indirectly, any profit,
benefit or advantage from the
club that is not offered equally to every full
member of the club.
<P>

	
<P>

	(l)  The club shall keep correct accounts and books in respect of the
financial affairs of the club showing the particulars usually
shown in accounts
and books of a like nature."
<P>

4	Some light is cast on what was envisaged by the legislature in enacting the
requirement of s. 10(1)(i) by s. 10(6) which provides
that a club does not fail
to meet that requirement by reason only that a member derives or is entitled to
derive any profit, benefit
or advantage not offered equally to every full
member if:
<P>

	(a)	that profit, benefit or advantage is derived pursuant to a contract
(including a contract of employment) or agreement and is,
in the opinion of the
Licensing Court, reasonable in the circumstances; or
<P>

	(b)	the profit, benefit or advantage consists only of a sum of money paid in
respect of services as a member of the governing body
or a committee and
payment has been approved by resolution at a general meeting of the club; or
<P>

	(c)	the profit, benefit or advantage consists only of limited hospitality in
relation to the sale or purchase of poker machines;
 or
<P>

	(d)	the profit, benefit or advantage consists only of payment of out of pocket
expenses of a kind authorised by a current resolution
of the governing body and
reasonably incurred in the course of performance of duties in relation to the
club.
<P>

5	S. 17 is concerned with the continued regulation and supervision of clubs
after registration.   A scheme is enacted pursuant to
which certain
individuals, including the Director of Liquor and Gaming appointed under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/" class="autolink_findacts">Liquor Act 1982</a>,</i> are given power to make a complaint concerning the
conduct of any club on grounds specified in sub s. (1AA).   Upon the making of
a complaint the Principal Registrar of the Licensing Court (inter alia) is
empowered to issue a summons calling on the club to show
cause why a
certificate of registration should not be cancelled.
<P>

6	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(2)</a> a Licensing Court is required to hear and determine the matter of
a complaint.   If satisfied that the complaint has been made out,
it can take a
range of disciplinary actions which include cancelling the certificate of
registration, ordering the club to pay a
monetary penalty, imposing conditions
upon its continued registration, and appointing an administrator to the affairs
of the club.
  Particularly relevant for present purposes, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(2)(f)</a> the
Licensing Court has power to declare that specified persons are ineligible for
a specified period to stand for election, be appointed
to or hold office as
secretary or member of the governing body of that or any other club.   By s.
17AAA(2)(b) the Licensing Court
is precluded from making a declaration of
ineligibility unless satisfied that the person concerned has been given an
opportunity
to show cause why the declaration should not be made.   By s.
17AAA(3) the Licensing Court may make such a declaration whether or
not the
grounds on which the complaint was originally made included the ground that the
person in question was not a fit and proper
person to hold office in the
club.
<P>

7	The grounds upon which a complaint may be made are spelled out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)</a>,
a comprehensive and detailed catalogue of matters which, if proved, could
provide the basis for any of the disciplinary courses
of action provided for by
sub s. (2).   The grounds provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)</a>, as they stood at the time
material to this appeal, were:
<P>

		   <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 17</a>
<P>

				(1AA)  . . .
<P>

					(a) . . .
<P>

			(i)  The requirements specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(1)</a> are not being 			met in
relation to the club, 
<P>

		(x) the club has failed to comply with the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 		37</a>, 39,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">40</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">48</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">49</a>, whether or not it has been convicted of an 		offence in respect
of that failure;
<P>

			(e) on any other ground that the person issuing the summons is 				satisfied
is not frivolous or vexatious.
<P>

8	It is unnecessary to set out in detail the balance of the grounds of
complaint which the sub section envisages.   It is sufficient
to say that the
grounds contained in the sixteen sub paragraphs of paragraph (a) are plainly
designed to comprehend the various forms
of misconduct, maladministration or
misfeasance that may attend the conduct and operation of a registered club;
and that the ground
provided by paragraph (e) is intended to leave open the
possibility of disciplinary action (even disciplinary action as drastic as
cancellation of registration) as a result of misconduct or maladministration of
a kind not otherwise specifically anticipated by
the legislature.   In my view,
paragraph (e) is designed to confer on the Director of Liquor and Gaming and
the Licensing Court a
broad ranging power of supervision and regulation over
clubs.   It is not, however, unlimited in its application.   The kind of
conduct
comprehended by para (e) must be conduct commensurate with the severe
consequences that may, by the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(2)</a>, follow:   <b>Seagulls
Rugby League Football Club Limited  v  Superintendent of Licences </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29
NSWLR 357:</a>   <b>Castellorizian Club Limited   v  Director of Liquor and
Gaming</b> (unreported, Court of Appeal, 7 June 1996).
<P>

9	Moreover, the ground in para (e) was not intended to duplicate any of the
grounds earlier spelled out nor to provide for a ground
inconsistent with any
of those contained in sub s. (1AA):  see <b>Seagulls</b>, per Kirby P, p 369.
Para (e) should not be used as the basis for a complaint that would properly
come within any of the more specific
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17.</a>
<P>

10	On 1 November 1994 para (1AA(a)(i)) was amended to read:
<P>

	"The requirements specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(1)</a> are not being met, <u>or have not
been met</u>, in relation to the club." (emphasis added)
<P>

11	Since this amendment, para (e) would not, by reason of the rule against
duplication of the other <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> grounds laid down in the decision in
<b>Seagulls</b>, be available as a foundation for a complaint of past non
compliance with any of the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10(1).</a>   Allegations of past non
compliance with any of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10(1)</a> would, since the amendment, be
laid as complaints on the ground provided for by  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)(a)(i).</a>   However,
that was not the case at the time relevant to the present appeal.   Sub para
(i) was then drafted in such a way as to
catch only non-compliance that was
current and continuing at the date of hearing of the complaint.
<P>

12	Para (e) was deliberately framed as it was to enable a person entitled to
make a complaint to do so on the basis of conduct that
cannot be shown to
contravene any specific provision of the Act, but can be shown to demonstrate a
departure from the aims and objectives
of the Act, or evidence of disregard for
proper management and control of the club.   In saying this, I remain conscious
that, in
order to be brought within para (e), the conduct complained of must be
of sufficient seriousness to warrant consideration of the
disciplinary remedies
the Act envisages.
<P>

	<b>Background</b>
<P>

13	The plaintiff was at all material times the president of the club.   The
club was a registered club under the provisions of the
Act and therefore
subject to its regulatory, supervisory and disciplinary provisions.  It is
apparent that a principal focus and
activity of the club was, and is, its
involvement in and promotion of the sport of soccer.   On 19 April 1994, the
Director of Liquor
and Gaming (hereafter referred to as "the complainant") made
a complaint under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)</a>, whereupon the Principal Registrar of the
Licensing Court issued a summons calling upon the club to show cause why its
certificate
of registration should not be cancelled.
<P>

14	Eight separate grounds of complaint, each particularised by reference to a
series of factual allegations, were identified.  
The first three grounds of
complaint were made in reliance on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)(a)(i)</a>, that is, on the basis that
the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10(1)</a> were not being met.   Ground 4 was made in reliance
on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)(a)(xiv)</a>, that is, on the basis that one of the statutory
conditions contained in s. 9A was not being adhered to.   The remaining
grounds,
5, 6, 7 and 8, were all made in reliance on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17(1AA)(e)</a>, that is,
the general provision:
<P>

	 "on any other ground that the person issuing the summons is satisfied is not
frivolous or vexatious."
<P>

15	A hearing took place before Mr Keating, Licensing Magistrate, in October,
November and December 1994.   The club was a party
to the proceedings,
nominated as the defendant.   The present plaintiff was not a party.  However,
I was told, without objection
or demur, that he was present through the
proceedings, instructed counsel on behalf of the club, and gave evidence (as a
witness
for the complainant, although he was cross-examined by counsel
appearing for the complainant). I will at times refer to this hearing
as "the
club proceedings".   On 14 February 1995 the magistrate published a written
decision.   He rejected grounds 1, 2 and 3, the
complaints made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17</a>
(1AA)(a)(i), on the basis that that sub paragraph, being framed (as it then
was) in the present tense, required the non compliance
alleged to be current as
at the date of hearing, and that this had not been established.   On the basis
of his findings of fact he
rejected ground 4, the complaint made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
17(1AA)(a)(xiv).</a>   Having considered the particularised allegations and the
evidence and made the necessary findings of fact, he found grounds 5,
6, 7 and
8 made out.   It will be necessary to return to his findings of fact and to the
manner in which the complainant prosecuted
the complaint.
<P>

16	The magistrate listed the matter for further hearing to permit the parties
to address him in respect of the appropriate disciplinary
action under sub s
(2).   Further, having regard to findings of fact he made in relation to the
plaintiff and his evidence, he called
upon him, pursuant to s. 17AAA(2)(b), to
show cause why he should not be declared ineligible for office in accordance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17(2)(f).</a>
<P>

17	In a written decision published on 5 June 1995 the magistrate imposed on the
club a monetary penalty of $15,000.   It is unnecessary
to make further
reference to this decision.   
<P>

18	Following a hearing in November 1996 to which the plaintiff was a party and
to which I will from to time to time refer as "the
show cause hearing", the
magistrate, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17(2)(f)</a>, declared the plaintiff ineligible for office in
the club or any other registered club for a period of two years.   This
decision
is the subject of the present appeal, although the appeal depends
heavily also upon challenges both to the procedures and findings
of the
decision of 14 February 1995 (to which the plaintiff was not a party) but which
was largely the foundation for the declaration.
<P>

	<b>The grounds of appeal</b>
<P>

19	The summons commencing the appeal identifies numerous grounds of appeal,
but, in written submissions filed on behalf of the plaintiff,
these were
reduced to six, and were expressed as follows:
<P>

	"(a)  None of the matters relied upon by the Magistrate constituted any other
ground" with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17</a> (1AA )(e);
<P>

	(b)  it was not open to the Magistrate to hold that any of the grounds were
established having regard to the evidence and the Magistrate's
own findings;
<P>

	(c)  in making the declaration, the Magistrate took into account irrelevant
considerations;
<P>

	(d)  the hearing of the proceedings against Mr Labbozzetta was vitiated by
procedural unfairness and a denial of natural justice;
<P>

	(e)  the declaration made was not reasonably open on the evidence;
<P>

	(f)  the complaint is out of time - see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>."</i>
<P>

20	Since the argument on the appeal was confined to the grounds so reformulated
I will treat that reformulation as the final statement
of the plaintiff's
grounds of appeal.
<P>

21	Before moving to the individual grounds of appeal it is convenient to set
out, as shortly as possible, something of the facts
and circumstances on which
the complainant relied, and the facts found and conclusions drawn by the
magistrate in the club proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The Club Proceedings.</b>
<P>

22	Ground 1 of the complaint (laid under s. 17(1AA)(a)(i)) was that:
<P>

	"The requirements specified in s. 10(1) are not being met in relation to the
Defendant Club in that contrary to s. 10(1)(i) Antonio
Labbozzetta the
President, being a member of the Defendant Club has derived a benefit from the
Club that was not offered equally
to every full member."
<P>

23	Seven particulars were subscribed to this ground of complaint.   These
included allegations that, during a six month period in
1993, the plaintiff had
obtained cash advances, or advances against his American Express card;   that,
on two occasions in 1993 he
had received reimbursement for expenses on food and
drink incurred in entertaining guests at Sydney restaurants;  and that, in July
1992, he had incurred expenses for food and drink supplied by the club for
celebrations for his 25th wedding anniversary, the account
for which he paid on
9 June 1993.
<P>

24	Ground 2 of the complaint (also under s. 17(1AA)(a)(i)) was that:
<P>

	"The requirements specified in s. 10(1) are not being met in relation to the
Defendant Club in that contrary to s. 10(1)(i), a
member of the Defendant Club
whether or not he is a member of the Governing Body has derived a benefit from
the Defendant Club that
was not offered equally to every full member."
<P>

25	Five particulars were subscribed.   Included among them were allegations
that, in the 1992/1993 year, the Board of Directors
had incurred expenses
totalling $118,629.97 for committee meetings, and for entertainment of guests
(described in the summons as
"general" and "soccer");   that the Board of
Directors had exclusive use of a VIP viewing box, supplied at club expense with
food
and drink, at its soccer stadium;  and that the Board of Directors allowed
the Board Room to be supplied, at club expense, with cigarettes
and tobacco
products. 
<P>

26	Ground 3 (under s 17(1AA)(a)(i)) was that:
<P>

	"The requirements specified in s. 10(1) are not being met in relation to the
Defendant Club in that the Defendant Club did not
keep, in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.
10(1)(l)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered Clubs Act 1976</a></i>, correct accounts and books in
respect of the financial affairs of the Defendant Club showing the particulars
usually shown in accounts
and books of a like nature."
<P>

27	Nine particulars were subscribed.   These included allegations concerning
the documentation relating to the transfer of a soccer
player to a Belgian
club, and a number of separate allegations concerning financial records kept by
the club.
<P>

28	Having regard to the terminology of s.17(1AA)(a)(i) as it then stood, framed
in and confined to the present tense, the magistrate
found none of these
complaints made out.
<P>

29	He said:
<P>

	"Insofar as grounds 1, 2 and 3 are concerned these grounds are laid pursuant
to s. 17(1AA)(a)(i) alleging that the provisions of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10</a> (1)(i) <u>are not
being met</u> and I accept Mr Foord's argument that the relevant date for
determining whether there is a breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10</a> (1)(i) is at the date of
hearing.
<P>

	It is not in dispute that the particulars of grounds 1, 2 and 3  refer to
breaches which are no longer subsisting at the time of
the hearing or at the
time of laying of the complaint." (emphasis in original)
<P>

30	There is no challenge to the magistrate's interpretation of sub para (i).
<P>

31	For different reasons, based on his findings of fact, he found the ground of
complaint numbered 4 also not made out, and it is
unnecessary to say any more
about that ground.
<P>

32	However, the particulars relied on to support grounds of complaint 1, 2 and
3 were repeated in identical terms as supporting
grounds 5, 6 and 7
respectively.   Indeed, in the framing of the grounds of complaint, the
complainant borrowed from and relied upon
the language of the same sections as
had formed the basis for grounds 1 - 3 excluding only the references to non
compliance with
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10(1).</a>   Thus, ground 5 was framed as follows:
<P>

	"Mr Antonio Labbozzetta the President, being a member of the Defendant Club
has derived a benefit from the Club that was not offered
equally to every full
member."
<P>

33	Instead of relying on s. 17(1AA)(a)(i), the complainant relied upon s.
17(1AA)(e) as the statutory foundation for the complaint.
  That being so, it
was unnecessary to allege any breach of or non compliance with any specific
provision of the Act.   The ground
of complaint was, however, otherwise
identical to ground 1, and was particularised accordingly.   
<P>

34	Ground 6 was framed as follows:
<P>

	"A member of the Defendant Club whether or not a member of the Governing Body
has derived a benefit from the  Defendant Club that
was not offered equally to
every full member."
<P>

35	This ground was laid in reliance on para (e) and was particularised in
identical terms to ground 2.
<P>

36	Ground 7 was framed as follows:
<P>

	"The Defendant Club did not keep correct accounts and books in respect of the
financial affairs of the Defendant Club showing the
particulars usually shown
in accounts and books of a like nature."
<P>

37	This ground was laid under para (e) and was particularised in identical
terms to ground 3.
<P>

38	It will be observed that, although in grounds 5, 6 and 7 reliance was not
placed on non compliance with any provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)</a>, and such non
compliance was not a component of the complaints there made, nevertheless the
wording of the complaints followed the
terminology of grounds 1 - 3, and the
wording of s. 17(1AA)(a)(i), omitting only reference to statutory non
compliance.   The only
difference between grounds 1 and 5, 2 and 6, and 3 and 7
is that grounds 1, 2 and 3 were brought under s. 17(1AA)(a)(i) and necessarily
relied upon and alleged non-compliance with one of the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10(1).</a>
 These failed because of the construction of paragraph (a)(i) as it then stood.
 Grounds 5, 6 and 7 were brought under para (e) which
was not limited by the
need for the complainant to establish conduct which was current at the time of
hearing, and which also was
not limited by the need to establish non compliance
with any provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1).</a>
<P>

39	Ground 8 of the complaint was:
<P>

	"The Defendant Club has engaged in business practices or decisions which are
not prudent or proper."
<P>

40	Seven particulars were subscribed, including allegations that, in breach of
the club's constitution, the Board of Directors had
approved a building
contract in excess of $500,000 without calling for tenders;  that the club had
entered into a contract for the
joint conduct of a soccer academy, the terms of
which contract did not adequately protect its position in the event of losses;
that
the plaintiff, as president, had, at the expense of the club, given gifts
to the General Secretary of the Federation of International
Football
Associations (FIFA); and that the club had supplied liquor off its premises for
the plaintiff's 25th wedding anniversary
celebration.
<P>

41	In summarising the factual allegations particularised I have omitted
reference to those which the magistrate did not find proved
and which he
therefore discarded from further consideration.
<P>

42	It seems clear that, in large part, the facts asserted on behalf of the
complainant were not in contest.   The real issues before
the magistrate, and
again on appeal, concerned the use that could be made of the largely undisputed
facts, given the manner in which
the complaint was framed and pursued.   
<P>

43	I turn now to the individual grounds of appeal.   It will be necessary, from
time to time, to make more extensive reference to
the facts alleged and found
proved.
<P>

	<b>The appeal</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Appeal grounds (a) and (b)</u></b>
<P>

44	The first and second grounds of appeal as reformulated are:
<P>

	"(a)  none of the matters relied on by the Magistrate constituted `any other
ground' within s 17 (1AA)(e)"
<P>

	(b)   it was not open to the Magistrate to hold that any of the grounds were
established having regard to the evidence and the
Magistrate's own
findings."
<P>

45	A number of different arguments in relation to these grounds were advanced.
Some of these were specifically directed to the individual
allegations
particularised.
<P>

46	(i)	Firstly, it was asserted that all allegations particularised (other than
one allegation found not proved and therefore presently
immaterial) were in
truth complaints about past breaches of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)</a>, and therefore, by reason of s
17(1AA)(a)(i) as it stood at the relevant time, and the decision in
<b>Seagulls, </b>is not available to support a complaint brought under para (e)
and<b> </b>excluded from consideration.   The argument was the converse of that
successfully advanced on behalf of the club (but not the plaintiff)
before the
magistrate in relation to grounds 1 - 3, of which an essential feature was, at
the relevant time, that para (a)(i) was
confined to  current non compliance
with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1).</a>   The very reason for the success of the
argument as raised by the club in relation to grounds 1 - 3 before the
magistrate, now compels
the failure of the argument as presently applied.   The
club was able to persuade the magistrate that concluded instances of non
compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> (1) did not come within s 17 (1AA)(a)(i).   The plaintiff
has not challenged that ruling as he would have been entitled to do in
present
circumstances, and has not argued that, in the present case, it should not be
followed.   It is axiomatic that, since past
instances of non compliance are
not comprehended by para (a)(i) of s. 17 (1AA), then the principle against
duplicity expounded in
<b>Seagulls </b>does not operate to exclude them from
para (e).
<P>

47	It is true, as I have earlier observed, that in framing grounds 5 - 7, the
draftsperson of the summons borrowed not only the
language, but also the
concepts, of s. 17(1AA).   It was not necessary to do so, but neither was it
impermissible.   In drawing on
those concepts, the complainant was not confined
to a pure repetition of grounds 1 - 3, and was entitled to expand the conduct
relied
upon to make out the ground, provided that, in doing so, the allegations
did not fall foul of the three limitations in <b>Seagulls</b> - the
prohibitions against duplicity, against triviality, and against inconsistency.

<P>

48	Accordingly, I reject the argument that, because the grounds may properly be
characterised as allegations of past breaches of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10(1)</a>, they did not and
could not come within para (e).
<P>

49	(ii)	Secondly, it was argued that the particulars to ground 5 failed to meet
the <b>Seagulls </b>test of seriousness; that is, that each of the grounds the
magistrate found to have been made out was too trivial to warrant consideration
being given, on that basis, to the disciplinary procedures provided for by the
Act.
<P>

50	Before moving to the merits of this argument, it is necessary to identify
one flaw in the approach taken.   In the written submissions
filed on behalf of
the plaintiff, consistent references were made to, for example, "ground 5 (ii)"
or "ground 5 (iii)";  in other
words, the plaintiff sought to characterise each
allegation particularised as a separate ground of complaint, and then to apply
to
it the <b>Seagulls</b> triviality test.   I am quite satisfied that this is
erroneous.   The ground of complaint is the general allegation - for example,
ground 5 is the allegation that the plaintiff had derived a benefit from the
club that was not offered equally to every full member.
  The complainant
sought to prove that ground by establishing, in each case, certain conduct
which he particularised.   That does
not mean that each particular, taken
individually, has to meet the <b>Seagulls </b>test;   what it means is that,
when relevant findings of fact in relation to the various particulars have been
made, the total conduct
or pattern of conduct disclosed has to be examined with
the <b>Seagulls </b>test in mind.  A single instance of conduct prohibited by
the Act, or otherwise potentially a ground for complaint, may not meet the
<b>Seagulls</b> test;  repetition, or a sustained pattern of the same conduct,
or a pattern of unsatisfactory conduct in a variety of ways, may do
so.   It
would be open, under para (e), for a complainant to allege general
maladministration of the club, particularised by a series
of disparate
instances of alleged breaches of the Act, each too trivial alone to meet the
<b>Seagulls</b> test, but together demonstrating a level of disregard for the
principles and purposes of the Act sufficient to warrant consideration
being
given to disciplinary action.   
<P>

51	I further observe, in this respect, that having regard to the manner in
which the summons and complaint were framed, that there
were in this case eight
separate complaints.   However, in considering whether any ground of complaint
had been made out, and, if
so, what disciplinary action (if any) was
appropriate, it was open to the magistrate to take into account the whole of
the conduct
proved.
<P>

52	There is one rider to what I have said.   The conduct which may be taken
into account in the consideration of whether a ground
of complaint has been
made out need not, as I have said, be conduct which is, alone, capable of
establishing the basis for disciplinary
action.   It must, however, be conduct
which is capable of contributing to the establishment of such a ground, and
capable of being
a factor in the overall decision that disciplinary action is
warranted.   It must be some form of misconduct, malfeasance,
maladministration,
or otherwise conduct that reflects adversely upon the
management of the club.   It must also be taken in the light always of the
Act
read as a whole, its aims and objectives, its long title and its detailed
provisions concerning the operation and administration
of registered clubs.
It would not be appropriate, for example, to take into account proven conduct
that could in no way reflect adversely
upon the club's operation and
management.   Moreover, in considering a ground of appeal framed as is the
ground presently under consideration,
care must be taken to avoid the
temptation to review the magistrate's findings of fact.   The triviality ground
of appeal can succeed
only if, as a matter of law, the whole of the conduct
upon which reliance is placed and which is found to have been proved is
incapable
of amounting to a ground for disciplinary action. 
<P>

53	What is involved in the determination of complaints presented as these were
is, in fact, a three step process.   The first step
is to decide which, if any,
of the factual allegations asserted in the particulars have been established.
In this case, as there
was little dispute about the facts, that step  presented
no real difficulty.   Any factual allegations not found proved should be
(and,
in this case were) discarded from further consideration.   The second step is
to decide which, if any, of those factual allegations
reflect adversely on the
club in such a way as to be available to contribute to a finding that the
complaint is made out, so as to
warrant consideration being given to
disciplinary action.   This does not, as I have said, require a conclusion that
each individual
allegation be sufficient to give rise to such a finding;   it
does require a conclusion that, together with other proven allegations,
it may
do so.   There must be, in the facts proved, some element of malfeasance,
maladministration, misconduct, or breach of or non
compliance with the express
requirements of the Act.
<P>

54	With these principles in mind, I turn to the detailed arguments advanced  on
the second limb of the first ground of appeal.
<P>

55	Specific argument about triviality was directed to certain of the factual
allegations particularised and held to have been established.
  Among these
were the allegation that the plaintiff had received cash advances from the
club, some with and some without the use
of his American Express card, and that
this facility was  not available to club members generally.   
<P>

56	I do not accept this argument.   As I noted earlier, it may well be that a
single instance of this conduct would be insufficient
to ground a complaint
under para (e), but a single instance was not alleged.   Six instances of
advances to the plaintiff unsupported
by his American Express card were
alleged.   Of these the magistrate found four proved, amounting to $7,500, over
a six months period.
 Advances against his American Express card amounting to
$13,500 over the same period were not disputed.
<P>

57	These alone, in the light of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)(i)</a>, were sufficient for the magistrate
to find the ground of complaint proved and to consider the disciplinary action
provided for by
s. 17(2).    Moreover, they were not the only matters relied
upon in support of the ground.   I reject the argument that the particulars
to
ground 5 were insufficiently serious to establish the ground of complaint.
Similar argument was directed to various of the particulars
subscribed to
grounds 6, 7 and 8 and must be rejected for the same reasons.
<P>

58	Two further particulars were that, on two separate occasions in 1993, the
plaintiff, as club president, entertained guests at
Sydney restaurants, for the
cost of which he was reimbursed.   It was essential to the allegations, and the
magistrate found, that
this constituted expenditure made available to the
plaintiff and not to all members of the club.   The magistrate's findings in
relation
to these particulars relevantly were as follows:
<P>

	"It is necessary to consider the nature of this luncheon and whether it falls
into as it were entertainment such as is there a
benefit or advantage.   I
consider that it must be to the benefit of the President to have lavishly
entertained Mr Blatter whether
the luncheon related to soccer interests or
otherwise.   I cannot see why any such luncheon could not have taken place at
the Club
which has quality dining facilities for such entertainment.   I find
this expenditure to be of a benefit to Mr Labbozzetta which
was not available
to all members of the Club."
<P>

59	It was firstly argued that the finding that the payment for his meal
constituted a benefit to the plaintiff was not open; and
secondly, that if it
were open, it is too trivial to meet the seriousness test imposed by
<b>Seagulls</b>.   It is this combined argument that has given me the greatest
difficulty in this appeal.   It was argued that:
<P>

	"The benefit found was unrelated to personal food or wine consumption by Mr
Labbozzetta.   It is an intangible benefit."
<P>

60	I cannot accept the factual underpinning of this argument.   It is plain
that the plaintiff joined in the consumption of food
and wine and that the
costs of his meal, as well as those of his guests, were paid by the club.
That there was some benefit to the
plaintiff is plain.
<P>

61	It is arguable, however, that the finding fails to recognise two important
factors.   The first is that, in entertaining the
guests, the plaintiff was,
presumably, discharging his duties as president, and indeed, the magistrate
referred to and appeared to
accept evidence and submissions to this effect.
The second thing the finding appears to overlook is that entertainment of
guests
is an important part of commerce and business, and, I venture to assume,
of the world of sporting and other clubs.   To some, entertainment
may be a
pleasurable part of the task;   to others, onerous.   However it is regarded by
the person involved,  it is an integral
part of the functions of the head of an
organisation which is what the president of a club is.
<P>

62	Ultimately, however, I have concluded that whether the payment for the
plaintiff's meals constituted a benefit to him was essentially
a question of
fact and although the magistrate in resolving it may as readily have come to
the opposite view, the view he did reach
was open to him and is not reviewable
on an appeal limited to a question of law.   I was not taken to the evidence on
which the finding
was based and it is not possible, in the circumstances, to
conclude that there was no evidence to support the finding.
<P>

63	That leads to the next question which is whether it was open to the
magistrate to use the finding of fact in his consideration
of disciplinary
action - that is, whether the finding that payment by the club of the cost of
the plaintiff's meal was capable of
contributing to a conclusion that
consideration of disciplinary action was warranted.
<P>

64	The question having been posed, the answer almost dictates itself.
Although views may well differ as to the significance of such
conduct, taking
into account the realities of business and commercial life to which I have
already alluded, this question, too, is
a question of fact - or, perhaps more
accurately, a question of weight but nevertheless, a question for the
magistrate unreviewable
on appeal.
<P>

65	(iii)	A third argument was that the payment by the club for the plaintiff's
meal was protected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10(6).</a>   
<P>

66	The ground of complaint against which these events were particularised was
borrowed from, and based upon, the prohibition in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)(i).</a>   That
prohibition is expanded and explained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(6)</a>, which excludes from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.
10(1)(i)</a> conduct of the kind described in paragraph 4 of these reasons.
<P>

67	Plainly, the benefit received by the plaintiff in entertaining guests at
club expense does not sit comfortably within any of
these exclusions and no
suggestion to the contrary was made.   The argument that was put was, in
effect, that the exclusions represent
the philosophy underlying the Act - that
the receipt of benefits incidentally in the pursuit of club interests is not to
be considered
as evidence of non compliance with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.
10(1)(i).</a>   It may be that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10(6)</a> was intended to ameliorate the effect of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10(1)(i)</a>, but it has not done so by excluding the kind of benefit the
magistrate held that the plaintiff received.   I reject this argument.
<P>

68	(iv)	A fourth attack was that there was no finding of fact that this was
not available to club members generally.   This can
readily be disposed of.
The magistrate referred, with apparent acceptance to evidence given by the
secretary of the club at the relevant
time:
<P>

	"...
<P>

	that cash advances were essentially available to a few members only and that
he had instructed House Managers that advances from
the strong room were not to
occur.   [He] indicated that he was aware that advances continued, particularly
to Mr Labbozzetta.
<P>

	...
<P>

	[He] gave evidence that he knew of no other member who availed himself of this
facility.   [This was in relation to the provision
of cash advances against the
American Express card.]
<P>

69	Another argument, in relation to ground 5, was that the finding that
particular (vii) had been established was not open on the
evidence.   The
particular was framed in the following way:
<P>

	"The President, A Labbozzetta incurred expenses for food and drink, supplied
by the Defendant Club for his 25th wedding anniversary
function on 1 July 1992,
totalling $2,034.   A Labbozzetta paid this account on 9 June 1993."
<P>

70	The magistrate's findings in this regard included acceptance of evidence
given that the function was a surprise party organised
by the plaintiff's
daughter.   On this basis, it was argued, it was not open to the magistrate to
find that the plaintiff "<u>incurred</u>" the expenses.   It was pointed out
that the complaint was not a complaint that the plaintiff received favourable
credit terms, or
delayed in making payments of his account, although some
findings in that regard appear in the decision.
<P>

71	It is appropriate to note what the magistrate found.   He said:
<P>

	"The facts are not in dispute.  An account in relation to this function was
first rendered to Mr Labbozzetta on 2 August 1992 and
accounts continued to be
rendered up to 31 May 1993.   The account was paid on 9 June 1993.   
<P>

	This function was a surprise party which was organised by Mr Labbozzetta's
daughter.   Mr Labbozzetta in his evidence indicated
that some 4 months after
the function he asked his daughter what was happening to the account and she
indicated that she would see
that it was paid.   In his record of interview Mr
Labbozzetta stated that he had assumed that his mother in law would pay.   Mr
Labbozzetta
agreed that the club could have sent him a monthly statement, but
that he personally does not look at the accounts or statements
because his wife
signs the cheques.   Mr Labbozzetta could not recall whether his wife ever
discussed the outstanding amount with
him.   
<P>

	Mr Bracher gave evidence that credit was generally stopped for outstanding
debtors after 3 - 4 months but that this policy was
not applied to all debtors.
 The policy was not applied in Mr Labbozzetta's case.   
<P>

	Mr Sartoretta gave evidence that there had been administrative difficulties in
collection of debts by the Club and that there have
been recent intensive
efforts to bring debtor's accounts under control and to improve methods of
collection.   
<P>

	I do not accept the conflicting versions which Mr Labbozzetta has put forward
and doubt that Mr Labbozzetta had any intention to
pay the outstanding account.
 Accounts rendered to Mr Labbozzetta's residence between 2 August 1992 and 31
May 1993 were ignored.
  It is of relevance that the account was paid on 9 June
1993 about the same time Mr John Ralston, solicitor, visited the Club to
talk
to the Board about their obligations under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered Clubs Act</a></i>.
According to Mr Foord's submissions Mr Ralston told the directors to cease
borrowing money from the Club as they were in breach
of the Act.   Apparently
after Mr Ralston's visit the practice ceased."
<P>

72	The essence of the complaint is not that it was the plaintiff who directly
incurred the expenses, nor the delay in payment of
the account;   the essence
of the complaint is that the plaintiff received benefits from the club not
available to others.   Implicit
in the magistrate's doubts about the
plaintiff's intention to pay the account is a finding that it was anticipated
(whether by the
plaintiff or others does not matter) that the food and drink
would be supplied for the plaintiff's benefit by the club.   There is
no
suggestion that such a benefit would be available to members of the club
generally.   Accordingly this challenge to the magistrate's
finding must be
rejected.
<P>

73	(v)	Particular and extensive argument was addressed to the findings of fact
in relation to one of the particulars subscribed
to ground 7 of the complaint
(which alleged failure to keep correct accounts and books);   the second
particular was that:
<P>

	"(ii)	The Defendant Club transacted the sale of a soccer player, namely Paul
Okon-Engstler to Club Brugge of Belgium in July 1991.
  Records of the
Defendant Club reveal an amount of $240,000 was banked on 10 July 1991 in
relation to the transfer of this player.
  This differs substantially from the
amount of $515,000 as shown on the official Player Transfer form, dated 8 July
1991 to be paid
to the Defendant Club in two instalments being - $400,000 on 9
July 1991 and $115,000 on 30 September 1991."
<P>

74	The magistrate's findings in relation to this particular were largely drawn
from the written submissions of counsel for the complainant.
  It seems that
the evidence relating to the transfer showed that the club's financial books
recorded receipt by it of $240,000 by
way of four cheques each in the amount of
$50,000 and one in the amount of $40,000;   receipt by the transferred player's
father
of $36,000, and receipt by another person, Mr Moaz, acting as agent,
apparently for the club, of $25,000.   Other documentation,
dated 8 July 1991,
painted a different picture.   A player transfer form lodged with the
Australian Soccer Federation indicated a
transfer fee of $515,000 to be paid by
Club Brugge, although the document on which this figure appeared had been
altered, the original
figure having been $575,000.   The alteration was
initialled by a number of people including the plaintiff.   A document on club
letterhead, also dated 8 July 1991 and signed by the club secretary, Mr
Bracher, and the secretary of Club Brugge, certified that
the club had received
$40,000 from Club Brugge for the transfer.   This figure, too, had been altered
from an earlier figure of $430,000,
which itself appeared to have been the
subject of alteration.   There was another document on club letterhead, dated
30 September
1991, in the same form and also signed by the two secretaries
which showed that the club had received $115,000 from Club Brugge,
this figure
also having the appearance of having been altered.   Two more documents, one
dated 8 July 1991 and another dated 1 July
1992, both certified that Mr Moaz
had received $150,000 and $125,000 from the club for commission and expenses
related to the transfer.
  These documents were not signed by anybody
representing the club.   The secretary, Mr Bracher, gave evidence that he had
been asked
by the plaintiff to sign these documents but had refused to do so,
as had another person whose position in the club was not identified.
<P>

75	It will be seen that the documentation relating to the transfer was
inconsistent and in a state of considerable confusion.
<P>

76	The magistrate noted and rejected an argument put on behalf of the club to
the effect that the club failed to keep <u>correct</u> accounts and books.   He
stated that it was not open to him to find the ground made out, at least in
relation to the factual allegation
particularised in this way.   This was (it
was argued) because the books and accounts did accurately reflect the
transaction so far
as it involved the club.   The magistrate held that the
"books and accounts" of the club included the transfer form lodged with the
Australian Soccer Federation, and the other documents to which reference has
been made, and that, since they were inconsistent with
one another, some (at
least) of them were necessarily incorrect.   He made no findings as to what the
transaction in fact was, or
which (if any) of the documents were correct and
which were incorrect.   He concluded his findings on this issue as follows:
<P>

	"This particular has generated a great deal of interest in the media following
the release of Mr Justice Stewart's report on behalf
of the Australian Soccer
Federation and it now forms part of the Senate inquiry.   I have therefore not
attempted to go into any
detail as to what were the respective roles of Mr De
Nolf, Mr Moaz and Mr Labbozzetta's relationship with them.   From the evidence
before me I am unable to state whether or not Mr Labbozzetta gained any
financial benefit from his role in the transfer.   What I
am satisfied is,
however, that the club's financial records relating to this transaction are
totally inadequate and accordingly this
ground of complaint is established."
<P>

77	The specific bases of appeal in relation to this matter were summarised in
the following way:
<P>

	"(a)	this is not an available ground of complaint within s. 17(1AA)(e)
because:
<P>

	"(i)	it is inconsistent with or duplicates 17(1AA(a)(i) and/or (a)(x);
<P>

	(ii)	as particularised, it does not constitute a failure to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.
10(1)(l)</a>;
<P>

	(iii)	it is not a serious matter;
<P>

	(b)	the findings and evidence do not, as a matter of law, establish the ground
of complaint."
<P>

78	Presumably, the first of these bases is intended to be an application of the
ground of appeal earlier rejected (see para 48)
that, as the requirement to
keep correct accounts and books is included in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)</a>, failure to do so is
incorporated in s. 17(1AA)(a)(i) and therefore excluded from para (e).   The
argument must be rejected for the
reasons already given.   As at the time of
the magistrate's hearing concluded failure to meet the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)</a>
was not encompassed by s. 17(1AA)(a)(i). 
<P>

79	The second argument is misconceived.   It proceeds on the basis that the
ground of complaint numbered 7 which was laid under
para (e), requires proof of
non-compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1)(l).</a>   It is true that the ground, as expressed,
contains terminology similar to, even drawn from, that paragraph, but ground 7
is not
a complaint about non compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10</a> and is not brought under s.
17(1AA)(a)(i).   It is quite independent of those sections, and must stand or
fall on whether the complainant
could establish, by reference to the factual
allegations particularised, something unsatisfactory about the conduct of the
club sufficient
to warrant consideration being given to disciplinary action.
In order to do that it was not necessary for the complainant to establish
a
failure to comply with any specific provision of the Act.   The complaint is
not confined in the way suggested.
<P>

80	The third argument may be equally quickly disposed of, by reference to the
facts as I have already outlined them.   It is quite
plain that what is alleged
is inaccuracy in the financial recording of a significant transaction involving
substantial sums of money.
  That allegation alone was capable of being
regarded as sufficiently serious to warrant invoking the disciplinary options
available,
and certainly capable of contributing to a conclusion that that
action was warranted.
<P>

81	The final argument in relation to this particular was that the findings and
the evidence, as a matter of law, did not establish
the ground of complaint.
The argument appears to be this:
<P>

	(i)	that, properly construed, "accounts and books in respect of the financial
affairs" of the club (the terminology in the ground
of complaint) included
banking (and perhaps other) records that showed the receipt by the club of
$240,000, but did not include documents
such as the Player Transfer Form or the
other documents showing receipt of different sums;
<P>

	(ii)	that, there being no finding as to which (if any) of the various
documents accurately reflected the transaction, it had not
been shown that the
"accounts and books" (as construed according to (i) above) were "incorrect";
<P>

	(iii)	that, therefore, the ground that the club did not keep "correct"
accounts and books had not been made out.
<P>

82	It is true that, on the magistrate's findings, and in the absence of a
finding as to the true nature of the transaction, establishing
the ground
depended upon the inconsistency between the various documents, showing that
some or all of them were necessarily incorrect.
  However, the plaintiff's
argument depends on the premise that the player transfer form and other
documents were not part of the
financial accounts and books, and this I do not
accept.   There is no reason to construe the phrase "accounts and books" as
used
in this ground of complaint (as distinct from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10(1)(l)</a>, as to which I
make no comment) in the way for which the plaintiff contends.   It was also
argued that a finding that the records
were "inadequate" does not amount to a
finding that the records were not "correct", the word used in the ground of
complaint, but
this argument fails as a consequence of my conclusion above.
Plainly, some (at least) of the records were incorrect.
<P>

83	Another argument was that there was no evidence and no finding as to what
particulars were "usually shown in accounts and books
of a like nature".   It
is true that there was no such finding, and, in the absence of the dissent on
behalf of the complainant,
I accept that there was no such evidence.   However,
the argument takes an unduly technical and literal approach to the
establishment
of the ground.   It surely does not require specific evidence to
establish that financial accounts and books would ordinarily disclose
details
of a transaction of the kind and size of that here in question.
<P>

84	Further argument was directed to the magistrate's adverse findings on the
plaintiff's credibility in relation to this allegation.
   This, since it
related to the appeal more generally, will be dealt with below.   
<P>

85	(vi)	The remaining matter to which specific argument was addressed was the
sixth particular subscribed to ground 8.   In ground
8 it was alleged that the
club engaged in imprudent or improper business practices.   The sixth
particular was an allegation that
the plaintiff had, at club expense, given
gifts of wine to the value of $440.10 to the general secretary of FIFA.   In
his findings
the magistrate said:
<P>

	"Mr Bracher was directed by Mr Labbozzetta to arrange these gifts without the
apparent approval of the Board.   Mr Lee noted that
the documents authorising
the dispatch of wine was signed by the Club's stock controller but does not
record who authorised the controller
to take this action.   Mr Lee agreed that
the documents were inadequate.
<P>

	I am satisfied that the decision to supply the gifts to Mr Blatter was not
prudent or proper, in all the circumstances and is clearly
of no benefit to the
members of the Club.   Moreover, the supply of the liquor would appear to be
contrary to the provisions of s.
44(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered Clubs Act</a></i>.
<P>

	S. 44 (1) states:
<P>

	`A registered Club shall not supply or dispose of liquor or cause or suffer
liquor to be supplied or disposed of except on the
defined premises of the Club
...' "
<P>

86	One basis for the appeal in relation to this particular was that the
magistrate relied on what were described as unparticularised
contentions that
the gift was arranged without Board approval or contrary to the section
mentioned, and that it was not permissible
for him to do so.   I do not accept
this argument.   A practice may be imprudent or improper for a variety of
reasons, including
that it contravenes a provision of the Act, or that it is
undertaken without appropriate authorisation.   It was not necessary for
the
basis for asserted impropriety or imprudence to be particularised (unless, in
some way, the club or the plaintiff were misled
about the way in which the
complainant sought to establish his case).   It was also argued that breaches
of club rules are dealt
with in s. 17(1AA)(a)(xi), and that what was alleged by
the complainant and found proved by the magistrate therefore duplicated that
sub paragraph and was, therefore, not within par (e): (<b>Seagulls</b>).  This
argument is also rejected.   The ground for which s. 17(1AA)(xi) provides is
that:
<P>

	"a rule of the club referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 30(1)</a> has been broken or any other rule
of the club has been habitually broken,"
<P>

87	Ground 8 of the complaint as particularised does not allege a breach of any
rule of the club referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 30(1)</a> or otherwise, and the magistrate's
decision does not incorporate a finding of any such breach.   There was no
duplicity.
<P>

88	(vii) 	The final argument in relation to ground 8 is that this allegation is
too trivial to meet the <b>Seagulls</b> seriousness test.   If the allegation
about gift to the secretary of FIFA stood alone I would be inclined to accept
the contention.
  However, it does not stand alone.   What has to be looked at
in the light of the <b>Seagulls</b> test is the whole of the conduct alleged
(and proved).   An ill advised and unauthorised gift, apparently otherwise
innocuous, may
take on a different character when the whole picture of the
administration of the club is considered.   
<P>

89	The specific challenges to the findings in relation to grounds 5, 7 and 8
fail.
<P>

90	These conclusions dispose of the first and second grounds of appeal as
reformulated.
<P>

	<b>Appeal Ground (c) - Irrelevant Considerations </b>
<P>

91	The third ground of appeal is that, in making the declaration, the
magistrate took into account irrelevant considerations.  
These were identified
as:
<P>

	"(a)	[the magistrate's] own findings as to Mr Labbozzetta's credit in respect
of the Okon transfer;
<P>

	(b)	the President's Report in the Marconi News October - November 1995;
<P>

	(c)	a view without foundation that an assurance that breaches will recur is
not reflected in Mr Labbozzetta's written reports;
<P>

	(d)	a "finding" that Mr Labbozzetta used the Club as "some form of private
bank" and restricted "privileges" to Board members or
a select few;
<P>

	(e)	that the grounds alleged related in some way to corrupt practices;
<P>

	(f)	that the grounds related to a failure to adhere to the requirements of the
Act."
<P>

92	It is necessary to examine each of these in turn.   
<P>

93	(a)	<u>The Plaintiff's Credit</u>    In the club proceedings the magistrate
made a number of findings adverse to the plaintiff relevant to his credibility.
 The plaintiff
 had been a principal witness called on behalf of the
complainant.   For example, in relation to ground 5, particular (ii) (cash
advances against his American Express card) the magistrate disbelieved the
plaintiff's evidence that he was unaware of the cost incurred
by the club as a
result of the advances.   In relation to particular (vii) (expenses for his
wedding anniversary function) the magistrate
disbelieved what he called "the
conflicting versions" put forward by the plaintiff.   Importantly, in relation
to particular (ii)
of ground 7 (the Okon transfer) he rejected the plaintiff's
evidence about his level of involvement in the transaction.   He described
the
plaintiff's evidence in this regard as "evasive and untruthful".   In the show
cause proceedings the magistrate specifically
adhered to the view he had
expressed about the evidence given to the plaintiff in relation to the Okon
transfer.   He nevertheless
referred to and took into account other evidence in
those proceedings relating to the plaintiff's character, reputation, capacity,
and diligence as president.
<P>

94	In the show cause decision the magistrate returned to the general subject of
the plaintiff's credibility.   He did this particularly
in dealing with the
plaintiff's involvement in the Okon transfer allegation, which he held to
be:
<P>

	"perhaps more disturbing than the other particulars of complaint found proven
because of the opportunity for a large sum of money
to be unaccounted for."
<P>

95	He held:
<P>

	"In my earlier decision I referred to Mr Labbozzetta's inconsistent evidence
relating to this transaction.   Whilst I can accept
Mr Bannon's submissions
looking solely at the failure to maintain adequate records, Mr Labbozzetta's
response or lack of response
generally in regard to the transaction continues
to be of concern. ... The reason why so many questions remain unanswered
concerning
this transaction, is because Mr Labbozzetta, for whatever reason,
has failed to answer them."
<P>

96	He maintained his view of the plaintiff's evidence as evasive and
untruthful, did not accept his asserted inability to recall
details of the
transaction, and was satisfied that, contrary to his evidence, the plaintiff
had played a significant role in the
negotiations, and that the progress of the
transaction was with his full knowledge or at his specific direction.
<P>

97	It will be observed that it was not suggested that the findings concerning
the plaintiff's credibility, other than those made
in relation to his evidence
on the Okon transfer, were irrelevant.   The argument was confined to the
asserted irrelevance in the
show cause proceedings, or the findings on the Okon
transfer issue.   Counsel repeated the earlier submission that the magistrate
incorrectly directed his mind to the adequacy (as distinct from the
correctness) of the financial records, and noted that the magistrate
avoided a
determination of the correct nature of the transaction, opting instead for the
conclusion that, since the records are contradictory,
some (at least) of them
must have been incorrect.   In this context counsel submitted that, as the
plaintiff had not sought to give
evidence that the records were adequate, the
findings relating to his credibility in other respects were irrelevant.
Moreover, it
was argued, in the proceedings in which these findings were made,
the plaintiff was not a party, and the level of his involvement
was not an
issue.   The only issues in that hearing concerned the club not the plaintiff.
This argument overlooks the fact that,
in the show cause proceedings, the
plaintiff having had the opportunity to be heard, the magistrate adhered to and
reiterated his
view of the evidence earlier given by the plaintiff.   
<P>

98	It was argued that, by reason of the findings against the club, which the
plaintiff in the show cause proceedings did not attempt
to disturb, the
plaintiff's "continuing lack of response" was also irrelevant,   there being
nothing he could have added on that
issue.   The present issue, therefore, it
was argued, concerns the extent to which the fact that the plaintiff wrongly
denied involvement
is relevant to the making of a declaration of ineligibility
under s 17(2)(f).
<P>

99	Arguing that that fact is irrelevant, counsel pointed out:
<P>

(i)   the ground of complaint concerning the Okon transfer did not involve the
giving of evidence which was not accepted or was
held to be untruthful; and
<P>

(ii)   that the s. 17 regime is protective, not penal (<b>Seagulls</b>;
<b>Sydney Aussie Rules) Social Club Limited  v  Superintendent of Licences</b>
(unreported, Grove J, 1 July 1991).
<P>

100	The first of these can be put aside.   In order to determine whether the
plaintiff should be declared ineligible for office
for any period of time it
was not necessary that his lack of credibility be pleaded or established as one
of the grounds of complaint.
  As to the second, while it is true that the s 17
regime is intended to be protective, that protection is in part achieved by the
maintenance of standards of honesty and integrity in the individuals involved
in the operation and management of registered clubs.
  Lack of honesty and
integrity in any individual in giving evidence to the very body - the Licensing
Court - entrusted with statutory
role of supervising the operation of clubs is
a highly relevant factor in the assessment of that person's suitability to hold
office.
  So to hold is not, as the plaintiff's argument implies, to "penalise"
him for his lack of honesty, but to appreciate the impact
of the circumstances
on his suitability for the office he has held.   Counsel very properly
acknowledged that s.17AAA(3) makes clear
that a declaration may be made whether
or not the ground of complaint includes the ground that the person whose
eligibility is under
consideration was not a fit and proper person to hold
office.   That sub section in my view concludes this aspect of the argument
against the plaintiff.   Counsel argued that the magistrate wrongly "elevated
the adverse credit finding to the level of a ground
of complaint".   This
cannot be sustained.   What the magistrate did was consider the plaintiff's
suitability for the office he held
in the light of his findings of fact in both
the club proceedings and the show cause proceedings.   
<P>

101	Counsel drew parallels with the criminal sentencing principle that a plea
of not guilty cannot be used as a basis to increase
penalty, but a plea of
guilty might legitimately be used as a factor in reduction in sentence.   The
parallel is inappropriate for
a number of reasons.   As counsel had already
pointed out, the proceedings, and the disciplinary action taken, were
protective not
penal, and sentencing principles have no application.   More
severe disciplinary action was not taken because the plaintiff refused
to
acknowledge his guilt of an offence;   his lack of frankness with the Licensing
Court was properly a factor relevant to his eligibility
to hold office.
<P>

102	A further argument was that the magistrate wrongly "treated the inquiry as
one as to whether [the plaintiff] was a fit and proper
person for office."   No
argument was directed to establish the proposition that that was not an
appropriate inquiry for the magistrate.
  In my view, while s 17(2)(f) is
potentially wider than an inquiry so framed, the fitness and suitability for
office of the person
whose eligibility is under consideration is well within
the parameters of the section and an eminently proper line of inquiry for
the
magistrate in the show cause proceeding.
<P>

103	The final argument put was that, "at the very least, the magistrate made an
error of law in giving undue consideration to Mr
Labbozzetta's evidence in
relation to the Okon transfer".
<P>

104	This is no more than an argument relating to the weight to be given to a
relevant matter and is not open to be argued in an
appeal limited to questions
of law.
<P>

105	(b)	<u>The President's Report</u>	The next matter argued to be an
irrelevant consideration taken into account by the magistrate is a report made
by the plaintiff to
club members in the Marconi News of October - November
1995.   The magistrate extracted from the report the following:
<P>

	"There were 58 complaints levelled at the Club.  40 complaints have since been
dismissed.   We believe these complaints are based
on administrative oversights
which the club management should have attended to, rectified, and indeed
prevented, leaving eighteen
complaints to be answered.
<P>

	There are about 1500 registered clubs in NSW.   I believe that almost none of
these Clubs would be able to stand up to an investigation
similar to the one
this Club has had to endure, without at least some breaches being detected.
It is also my belief that none of
these Clubs would stand for one or some of
their members to voluntarily report their own Club to the authorities without
first bringing
their grievances to the Board of Directors.   If following this
they were still not fully satisfied, they then could have brought
the matter to
the attention of all the members.  
<P>

	...
<P>

	I personally believe that the events of the recent past were instigated by
some Members of this Club amongst which, sadly, there
were some former
directors, whose motivation in my opinion, was based on personalism."
<P>

106	Of this, the magistrate said:
<P>

	"... the copy of the President's report in the Marconi News October - November
1995 gives some indication of Mr Labbozzetta's attitude
to these
proceedings."
<P>

107	A little later he said:
<P>

	"In his evidence before the court he expresses regret for the breaches and
gives an assurance they will not recur.   This attitude
is not reflected in his
written reports."
<P>

108	Properly analysed, what the magistrate did was to use the post decision
publication of the plaintiff as evidence relevant to
his suitability for
office.   Had the plaintiff acknowledged the maladministration and expressed
contrition, that would have been
an extremely relevant factor to take into
account in his favour.   The somewhat belligerent tone of the article,
evidencing the absence
of any comprehension or concern on the plaintiff's part
of the purposes of and the need for supervision of the club's operations
was a
relevant factor for the magistrate to take into account.
<P>

109	(c)	<u>Possible recurrence</u><b>.   </b>The third alleged irrelevant
consideration taken into account by the magistrate was described as 
<P>

	"a view without foundation that an assurance that breaches will not recur is
not reflected in Mr Labbozzetta's written reports".
  
<P>

110	It was not seriously argued that the absence of an assurance that breaches
would not recur was not a relevant consideration;
  it plainly was.   The real
argument in this respect was that there was no foundation for the conclusion
reached by the magistrate.
  I do not accept this.   The plaintiff expressed a
belief that no other registered club could withstand the sort of scrutiny to
which the club was registered, and expressed the opinion that malcontents in
the club had instigated investigation.   It was open
to the magistrate to
conclude from these statements that the plaintiff's reports did not reflect his
assurance given otherwise that
breaches would not recur.  
<P>

111	(d)	<u>Privileges available to the plaintiff</u>.   The fourth asserted
irrelevant consideration was the magistrate's "finding" that the plaintiff used
the club as: 
<P>

	"some form of private bank, and restricted "privileges" to Board members or a
select few."
<P>

112	The magistrate's remarks were made in the context of his consideration of
the plaintiff's attitude to the grounds of complaint.
  What he said was:
<P>

	"Whilst Mr Labbozzetta may feel that the grounds of complaint are not serious
matters and that the investigation by the Director
of Liquor and Gaming was
unjustified or an overreaction, it should be stressed that the Club Marconi is
a registered Club under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered Clubs Act</a>.   Such registration entitles
the club to many privileges not the least of which is a liquor licence and
access to poker machines.
  With these privileges come obligations to strictly
adhere to the requirements of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered Clubs Act</a>.   Club Marconi is not a
privately owned or run soccer club.   It cannot be used as some form of private
bank and privileges cannot
be restricted to Board members or a select few."
<P>

113	Again, it was not the relevance of the conclusion that was the nub of the
argument;  the argument was that the conclusion was
not available on the
evidence.   In my view the observation is entirely consistent with the earlier
findings of fact and concessions
made by the club that cash advances had been
made available to the plaintiff but not all club members.    It was a relevant
matter.
<P>

114	(e)	<u>Corrupt practices</u>.   The next matter said to be an irrelevant
consideration taken into account by the magistrate was that the grounds alleged
related
in some way to corrupt practices.   This overstates the findings made
by the magistrate.   He was referring to the importance of
observance by clubs
of the statutory requirements.   He said:
<P>

	"These provisions emphasise the absolute importance of Clubs following the
strict letter of the law in relation to them in order
to avoid the
possibilities of corrupt practices arising in what, in the case of Club
Marconi, is now a very large undertaking involving
many millions of
dollars."
<P>

115	This cannot be construed as a finding that corruption was involved in any
of the incidents or events of which he heard evidence.
  He was stressing the
rationale for the strict regime of supervision.
<P>

116	(f)	<u>Statutory requirements</u>.  The final matter asserted to be an
irrelevant consideration was said to be a finding that the grounds were related
to a failure
to adhere to the requirements of the Act.   The passages in the
decision to which this refers have been quoted above.   The argument
misstates
what the magistrate said.   He was, properly, observing the purposes and
functions of the Act, and the importance of compliance
with its provisions.
He was not saying that the grounds he had upheld included grounds that the club
had failed to adhere in any
specific way to the requirements of the Act.
However, had he done so he would not have been incorrect.   Much of what was
alleged
against the club did in truth relate to non compliance with specific
provisions of the Act.
<P>

117	There is no basis for the claim that the magistrate's decision was infected
by irrelevant considerations.   The third ground
of appeal fails.
<P>

	<b>Appeal Ground (d) - Procedural Unfairness.</b>
<P>

118	The essence of this ground of appeal was that the plaintiff should have
been, and was not, advised that an adverse finding could
be made at the club
hearing as to the extent of his involvement in the Okon transfer, and the
problems with its documentation, notwithstanding
that the proceedings were then
only against the club and the plaintiff was not a party.   Reference was made
to <b>Ainsworth  v  Criminal Justice Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d92%29%20175%20CLR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-92) 175 CLR 564</a>;
<b>Mahon  v  Air New Zealand</b> (1984) AC 808.
<P>

119	It was argued that there was, as it turned out, a conflict of interest
between the club and the plaintiff.   It was in the club's
interest to
establish that the transaction documentation was something undertaken by the
plaintiff without proper reference to other
club officials and he was
accordingly disadvantaged by not being separately represented in order to
protect himself from having the
blame shifted to him.
<P>

120	There was a curious twist in the logic of this argument.   It was common
ground that it was the plaintiff who undertook the
defence of the proceedings
on behalf of the club, who was present throughout the hearing, and who
instructed counsel.   No doubt
it was he who took the decision on behalf of the
club (if such a decision were taken, which seems unlikely) to blame himself for
the unsatisfactory nature of the Okon documentation.   In fact, it seems
reasonably plain that, while the magistrate found that the
plaintiff was
intimately involved in the transaction and its documentation, that finding was
made in the face of the evidence given
by the plaintiff.   In other words, the
premise on which the argument is based, that the club took the decision to
leave the plaintiff
with the blame for what had happened, is unsupportable.
Although, in retrospect, a potential conflict of interest might have emerged,
none did, and the plaintiff, acting on behalf of the club, denied personal
involvement.  That he was not believed is not a question
of procedural
unfairness.   
<P>

121	In any event, exhibit 1 on the appeal was a letter dated 30 September 1994,
from the Crown Solicitor, addressed to the plaintiff.
  It points out in the
clearest possible terms that the complainant would, in the event that the
complaint was held to have been
made out, seek a declaration of the plaintiff's
ineligibility under s.17(v)(f),  and drawing to the plaintiff's attention the
need
to consider obtaining independent legal advice.
<P>

122	This ground of appeal fails.
<P>

	<b>Appeal Ground (e) - Declaration not available.</b>
<P>

123	The next ground of appeal was that the declaration of ineligibility was not
reasonably open on the evidence.   The argument
was that any suspension was a
manifestly excessive disciplinary response, but certainly a declaration of
ineligibility for a period
as long as two years was manifestly excessive.   I
do not agree.   The magistrate was satisfied on the facts that there were wide
ranging problems with the club administration, that the plaintiff had been
intimately involved in the incidents and events which
gave rise to the
complaints, that he had been evasive and untruthful in giving evidence to the
court, and had demonstrated his lack
of comprehension of the importance of the
role of the court in the reports he made to members.   These were all
significant matters
to take into account in relation to his suitability to hold
office.   I am satisfied that there was no error in the magistrate's
approach
in this regard.
<P>

	<b>Appeal Ground (f) - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i></b>
<P>

124	The final ground of appeal is that, by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices
Act</a>,</i> the complaint was statute barred.   However, in the light of the
decision of the Court of Appeal in <b>Bodanski  v  Jones</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR
677</a>, this ground was taken as a matter of formality only.   I reject the
ground.
<P>

125	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42(2)</a>, on the determination of an appeal, this court is to remit the
matter to the Licensing Court, or make such other order as it thinks
fit.   The
appropriate order, in my view, is to dismiss the appeal with costs.   It is
unnecessary that it be remitted to the Licensing
Court.
<P>

126	The orders I make are
<P>

	(i)	the appeal is dismissed
<P>

	(ii)	the plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs of the appeal.
