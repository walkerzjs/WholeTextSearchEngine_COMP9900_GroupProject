<b>JUDGMENT  (Evidence available on application re Corrs subpoena)</b>
<P>

1	On 28 April 1999 (T1427.5) I made an order that such evidence as is relevant
in the application by Messrs Corrs Chambers Westgarth
with respect to the
subpoena served upon it by the defendant would be evidence in the substantive
application by the defendant to
amend its case on justification.
<P>

2	Insofar as a submission was sought to be founded in evidence given by Mr
Woodhouse (T982.15-50;  T983.1-5;  T988) relating to
his attitude to the state
of the investigation and to meetings with Mr Lee on 8 and 22 March, a dispute
arose as to the availability
of this evidence for the purposes of any such
submission in the Corrs application.
<P>

3	The evidence before the Court in respect to the inspection of the documents
now marked as Exhibits A, B and C in the application
concerning the Corrs
subpoena is constituted by Mr Lee's affidavits sworn on 20 and 23 April 1999
(three in number) and his oral
evidence given on 28 April.  No order was made
that evidence in the substantive application be evidence in the application in
connection
with the Corrs subpoena.  
<P>

4	Mr Woodhouse (and Mr Potter) gave evidence at a time when the issues of
privilege, immunity and confidentiality in relation to
Exhibits A, B and C were
not before the Court and indeed, Messrs Corrs Chambers Westgarth were not
represented.  The subpoena the
subject of the present application had not even
been issued.
<P>

5	Mr Woodhouse was cross-examined about continuing investigations which was a
question relevant to the issue of public interest
immunity on the Amendment
Application as distinct from the immunity issue in the present application
which is confined to an agreement
as to confidentiality.  So far as reliance is
sought to be placed on evidence by given Mr Potter in the substantive
application,
he was cross-examined about the extent of investigations which the
plaintiff had made and was able to make in relation to D18 to
D25, relevant
again only to the Amendment Application.
<P>

6	As was submitted by Mr McHugh, some care has been taken in respect of which
evidence is before the Court in relation to which
application.  For example, Mr
Flynn had to be subpoenaed independently by the defendant on its Amendment
Application.  Portions of
the affidavits read in support of the plaintiff's
case on the earlier privilege argument had to be tendered as admissions on the
Amendment Application and, as indicated above on 28 April, I made the specific
order referred to.
<P>

7	No application nor any order was made that the evidence in the Amendment
Application be evidence in relation to Exhibits A, B
and C on the application
concerning the Corrs subpoena.  The evidence therefore is confined as I have
allowed and thus I confirmed,
yesterday, the Order made on 28 April.
<P>
