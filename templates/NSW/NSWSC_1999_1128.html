070031/99	<b>REGINA   v   LMW</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

(Re:  admissibility of evidence of Constable French)
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The Crown is seeking to introduce evidence of
conversations which a police officer had with the accused at his
home on 3
March 1998 and later at the police station.  Mr Zahra has objected to the
evidence being introduced and Constable French,
who participated in the
conversations, and Detective Sergeant Foster, who heard the conversations at
the accused's home, have given
evidence on the voir dire and have been
cross-examined.
<P>

2  	Mr Zahra has submitted that the evidence sought to be tendered
should be excluded because of the requirements of s 424A of the
<i>Crimes
Act</i>.  He has submitted further that the evidence should be excluded under
ss 85, 90, 137 and 138 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  Finally he relies on s 139
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.
<P>

3  	At the outset I should record the evidence which the Crown seeks
to introduce.  Constable French has stated that he attended
the accused's home
at 8.20 am on 3 March 1998 in company with Detective Sergeant Foster.  There he
said he first spoke to the accused's
mother, and subsequently to the accused.
The evidence which the Crown seeks to elicit is that having introduced himself
and Sergeant
Foster to the accused's mother as officers from the Macquarie
Fields Detectives' Office, he asked the child's mother:  <i>"Do you have a son
named [LMW]?"</i>  He received an affirmative reply and the accused then came
to the front door where the police officer had introduced himself.  This
conversation then occurred, according to Constable French (and for the purposes
of this judgment I include the various paragraph
numbers to be found in the
relevant statement made by Constable French):  
<P>

<i>"(</i><cite>Paragraph 13</cite><i>) `[LMW] do you know Corey from across the
street?'  He said, `No.'  The young child's mother said, `Little Corey?'
[Constable French]
said, `Yes.'  She said `You know Corey.'  The young child
said, `Yes.'  [Constable French] said `When was the last time you saw Corey?'
He said, `Yesterday.'  [Constable French] said `Where were you when you saw
Corey?'  He said, `I was riding my skateboard.'</i>
<P>

<i>(</i><cite>Paragraph 14</cite><i>) [Constable French] then said to the young
child, `Did you see him any other time yesterday?'  He said, `No.'  [Constable
French]
said `Do you know [GW2] from next door to Corey?'  He said, `Yes.'
[Constable French] said `Did you tell her that you saw Corey at
the creek?'  He
said, `No.'  [Constable French] said `She has told me you told her that.'  He
said `I didn't tell her, I told [GW1].'
 [Constable French] said `Her sister?'
He said, `No, she's Corey's sister.'  [Constable French] said `Did you tell her
that you saw
Corey at the creek?'  He said `No.  Ah, I saw Corey with two boys
in the bush, that's what I told her.'</i>
<P>

<i>(</i><cite>Paragraph 15</cite><i>) [Constable French] then said to the young
child `The girls told me that you said he was at the creek.'  He said `The boys
told me
they were going to the creek.'  [Constable French] said `Are you
fibbing?'  He said, `Sure, I pushed him.  What do you think' and
the young
child became upset and walked away.  [Constable French] said to the young
person's mother, `Corey drowned in the river
yesterday afternoon.'  She said,
`Oh no'.  [Constable French] said `The only person that we have been told that
knew he was there
is [LMW].'</i>
<P>

<i>(</i><cite>Paragraph 16</cite><i>) The young child's mother said `Corey
(sic), come back here' and the young child returned to the front door and said,
`Yeah, I pushed
him in the creek.  So what.'  The young child's mother said
`[LMW], don't be cheeky.' </i>
<P>

<i>(</i><cite>Paragraph 17</cite><i>) [Constable French] then said to the young
child, `What happened?'  He said, `Well, the two boys kicked and punched him
and I told
them to stop, and he followed me down to the creek.  He wouldn't go
away and kicked me like he did last year so I pushed him in the
creek.  When I
pushed him in I ran and got help.'  [Constable French] said `Why didn't you
tell me that at first?'  He said `I don't
want to get in trouble.'"</i>
<P>

4  	Constable French then asked the accused's mother to attend the
police station with the accused to talk further about the matter,
and the
accused and his mother complied with this request.
<P>

5  	At the police station Constable French spoke further to the
accused's mother, asking her, in the absence of her son, whether
she would
permit the accused to be electronically interviewed and to participate in a
video interview at the scene. Mother and son
were then taken to an interview
room where they were seated, and Constable French informed them, addressing the
mother, that they
would wait for the Aboriginal Liaison Officer, but the mother
indicated that she was happy for her son to be interviewed without
that officer
and arrangements were made for the interview to proceed.  Constable French then
gave the following further account of
events:
<P>

<i>"(</i><cite>Paragraph 26</cite><i>) [He] asked the young child, `[LMW], what
I am going to do is talk to you about what happened to Corey yesterday.  Do you
understand
that?'  He said `Yes.'  [Constable French] said, `What I say and
anything you say to me will be taped by this machine,' and [Constable
French]
indicated the three tape decks in the hybrid recording device, `Do you
understand that?'  He said, `Yeah.'  [Constable French]
said `What we say will
be recorded on a video tape at the same time.  Do you understand that?'  He
said, `Yeah.'  [Constable French]
said, `When we finish you will be given one
of the tapes of what we say.  Do you understand that?'  He said, `Yes.' </i>
<P>

<i>(</i><cite>Paragraph 27</cite><i>) [Constable French] then said to the young
child, `[LMW], anything you say to me when I talk to you can be used in a
Court.  Do you
understand that?'  He said, `No.'  [Constable French] said, `Do
you know who goes to Court?'  He said, `Bad people.'  [Constable
French] said,
`[LMW], if I talk to you and you say something to me that says you have done
something bad to Corey, you might have
to go to Court.  Do you understand
that?'  He said, `Yes.'  [Constable French] said, `Okay [LMW], if you think you
might have done
something bad to Corey yesterday, you don't have to talk to me
about it.  Do you understand that?'  He said, `Yes.  I pushed him
into the
creek and he was splashing around in the water with his arms and legs and I
left to get someone to help.'"</i>
<P>

6  	At this stage however proceedings were interrupted when the
child's mother received a telephone call after which Constable French
was
informed that a solicitor was coming to the police station and that the mother
wanted to wait until he arrived before the interview
commenced.  That request
was complied with.  A solicitor then arrived from the South West Aboriginal
Legal Service.  Following discussion
which the solicitor held with the accused
and his mother, the police officer was informed that the boy's mother did not
want police
to interview her son.  There was no further interview and there was
no electronically recorded interview at all.
<P>

7  	There is no need for me to record the evidence of Sergeant
Foster.  He essentially adopts what Constable French asserted was
said at the
accused's house before he was taken to the police station.  Sergeant Foster was
not present at the further discussion
at the police station, but nothing turns
on this.
<P>

8  	Section 424A of the <i>Crimes Act</i> is in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>"(1)   This section applies in relation to evidence of an admission within
the meaning of this section. </i>
<P>

<i>(2)   Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless: </i>
<P>

<i>(a)   there is available to the court a tape recording made by an
investigating official of the interview in the course of which the
admission
was made, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as
to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could
not be made, there
is available to the court a tape recording of an interview with the person who
made the admission about the making
and terms of the admission in the course of
which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or
</i>
<P>

<i>(c)   the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to
why the tape recordings referred to in paragraphs (a) and
(b) could not be
made. </i>
<P>

<i>(3)   The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>) do not prevent the admission or use of a tape recording as
mentioned in subsection (2). </i>
<P>

<i>(4)   In this section: </i>
<P>

<i>"admission" means an admission:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)   that was made by a defendant who, at the time when the admission was
made, was, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected

<P>

<i>(b)   that was made in the course of official questioning, and </i>
<P>

<i>(c)   that relates to an indictable offence other than an indictable offence
that may be dealt with summarily without the consent

<P>

<i>"investigating official" means:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)   a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert

functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of
offences, prescribed by the regulations for
the purposes of this definition.
</i>
<P>

<i>"official questioning" means questioning by an investigating official in
connection with the investigation of the commission or possible
commission of
an offence. </i>
<P>

<i>"reasonable excuse" includes:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)   a mechanical failure, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning
electronically recorded, or </i>
<P>

<i>(c)   the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in
which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned.
</i>
<P>

<i>"tape recording" includes:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)   audio recording, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   video recording, or </i>
<P>

<i>(c)   a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously
recorded audio recording. </i>
<P>

<i>(5)   This section does not apply to an admission made before the
commencement of this section."</i>
<P>

9  	Section 424A has been considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal
in <i>R v Horton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 426</a>; <i>R v Schiavini</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/165.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA
165</a> and in <i>R v Reed</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/258.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 258.</a>  I have considered each of these
decisions for present purposes.  
<P>

10  	According to Constable French the accused admitted, first at his
home and again at the police station, that he pushed the deceased
into the
river.  However it is not every admission that enlivens the operation of s
424A, as the definition of "admission" in sub-s
(4) of the section makes plain.

<P>

11  	According to Constable French, at the time when he called at the
accused's home and the accused first admitted pushing the
deceased, he did not
suspect the accused of having committed an offence.  He said that he went there
to the home seeking in effect
to track the deceased's movements and to find out
who was the last to see the young child.  The police officer's information
apparently
was that the accused had said that the child was at the creek and
the purpose of his call, as I understand the thrust of his evidence,
was simply
to find out what the accused knew of the deceased's movements.  
<P>

12  	So it is, the Crown has submitted, that s 424A was not enlivened
because at the time the accused spoken to he was not suspected,
nor ought he
reasonably to have been suspected, by Constable French of having committed any
offence.
<P>

13  	The evidence which Constable French has given satisfies me that
at the time when he first spoke with the accused and when the
accused first
made what otherwise would have amounted to an admission for the purposes of s
424A Constable French did not suspect,
nor ought he reasonably to have
suspected, so far as inquiries had then proceeded, that the accused had
committed any offence.
<P>

14  	Hence s 424A can have, in my opinion, no application to the
admission which the accused made, and such as Constable French
detailed in
paragraphs 15 and 16 of his statement.
<P>

15  	However, the accused went on to elaborate upon that admission at
his home (paragraph 17 of Constable French's statement) and
to make the further
admission at the police station (paragraph 27 of that statement).  It seems to
me that for the purposes of those
later admissions, s 424A had been enlivened
because once the accused had first admitted pushing the deceased into the
creek, Constable
French ought reasonably to have entertained a suspicion for
the purposes of s 424A(4)(a).
<P>

16  	It is common ground that there never was any "tape recording"
concerning these later admissions, but the Crown has submitted
that there was
"a reasonable excuse" for this for the purposes of s 424A(1)(c).  Hence it has
argued that the evidence as to the
later admissions is not rendered
inadmissible under that section.
<P>

17  	I will not repeat what has been said in the Court of Criminal
Appeal about the purpose or operation of s 424A in those cases
to which I
referred earlier.  The purpose of the section was referred to in the Attorney
General's Second Reading Speech concerning
the Bill introducing the provision
(see paras 21-22 of the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in <i>Horton</i>), and in
<i>Reed</i> the Chief Justice described the requirements of s 424A as being
<i>"precise and rigorous".</i>
<P>

18  	I am satisfied that there was a reasonable excuse for no tape
recording of what took place at the accused's home.  I am satisfied
that
Constable French did not go to the boy's home suspecting that he had done
anything wrong or that the accused would make any
of the admissions which were
forthcoming there.  I am satisfied that Constable French was taken by surprise
by the events at the
home and that there was, in the relevant sense, a
reasonable excuse for no tape recording of any of the admissions there made.

<P>

19  	I am satisfied further that Constable French intended that a
tape recording would be made at the police station to record the
verbal
admissions.  Preparations were made for this to be done and the reason why
there was no tape recording at all was because,
following the involvement of
the solicitor for the accused, the decision was conveyed to the police officers
concerned as to the
unwillingness for there to be further interview of the
accused.  
<P>

20  	I should add that on 10 March 1998 a letter was written by the
solicitor for the accused restating that at that particular
point of time
<i>"on legal advice [LMW]'s parents have declined to allow him to be
questioned."</i>  By that same letter the accused's solicitor advised that the
child's parents would consent to [LMW] being questioned <i>"if he were granted
an indemnity from prosecution pursuant to s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act
(New South Wales) 1986."</i>  There was, of course, no decision made to grant
an indemnity, so the refusal of further questioning continued.
<P>

21  	Mr Zahra submitted that it was not enough that the police were
informed that the child was unwilling to be interviewed or that
the parents
were unwilling to have him interviewed.  He submitted that the section
required, even where there was a refusal to be
interviewed generally, that an
attempt to make a more limited interview remained necessary under the section.
That is to say, where
a person refuses to be interviewed at large the police
should persist in seeking a tape recorded interview for the limited purpose
of
having recorded only the admissions previously made orally.  
<P>

22  	I have given that submission anxious consideration but it seems
to me that the acceptance of the submission reads into the
section more than it
requires.  I am satisfied here on the evidence that there was what in effect
was a refusal to be interviewed
by way of tape recording at the police station
and once that occurred there was no further requirement for the police officer
to
persist in seeking to have some limited tape recording made.  The law has
always recognised a suspected person's right to remain
silent and s 424A
recognises this too.  Hence it is that the refusal of a person being questioned
to have any questioning electronically
recorded is expressly recognised as a
reasonable excuse under the section, and once there was conveyed in this case
an unwillingness
to be further interviewed, it was not required of the police
that they persist in seeking to obtain further incriminating evidence,
even of
a limited kind.
<P>

23  	In all the circumstances of this case, I have concluded that the
Crown has established that there was a reasonable excuse as
to why tape
recordings of the type referred to in s 424A(2)(a) and (b) could not be
made.
<P>

24  	Accordingly the evidence sought to be introduced should not be
excluded under the section.
<P>

25  	I turn to the submissions advanced under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></i>.
<P>

26  	It is conveniently firstly to consider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90</a> upon which Mr Zahra
submitted he principally relied.  This section provides:
<P>

<i>"In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an
admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular
fact,
if:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it
would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence."</i>
<P>

27  	The nature of the discretion to exclude evidence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90</a> is
not rigidly or narrowly defined.  It requires that the court have regard to all
the circumstances in which any admission was made
in determining whether it
would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence, in which case it may refuse
to admit the evidence in
question.  Reliability is not the only criterion of
fairness, and it was pointed out in <i>R v Swaffield</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=151%20ALR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">151 ALR 98</a> at 121:
<P>

<i>"The concept of unfairness has been expressed in the widest possible form in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (Commonwealth) and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (New South
Wales)."</i>
<P>

28  	The only evidence introduced on behalf of the accused on the
voir dire apart from that in cross examination of the police officers
was a
report from Dr Langeluddecke who assessed the accused on 4 August 1999.  Her
assessment was complemented by Ms Liddle, another
psychologist, on 11 August
1999, and, as I understand it, the report which Mr Zahra tendered records the
findings of both psychologists
together.  Dr Langeluddecke's opinion is that
the accused's intellectual abilities now <i>"are some two to two and a half
years below the levels generally expected given his chronological age of eleven
years eight months."</i>  Her further opinion, based upon <i>"parental report
and observations of [the accused's] behaviour"</i> is that the accused is
socially immature and his<i> "adaptive behaviour and social confidence"</i> are
<i>"at about an eight year old level"</i>.  Cognitive and psychosocial
functioning tests are consistent with reports from the accused's teachers that
his academic functioning
was some two to three years below the levels expected
at his age.  
<P>

29  	The youth of the accused and his functional performance in the
respects addressed by Dr Langeluddecke are matters which are
relevant in the
exercise of the discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90.</a>  Moreover, Mr Zahra's cross-examination
of the two police officers emphasised that prior to the time that the accused
made the admissions
at his home he had not been told by either officer that the
two men were police officers.  Neither officer was in police uniform.
 I do not
make this observation by way of criticism of either officer, and they had
identified themselves to the child's mother before
there was any conversation
with the accused.  Although the accused was obviously nearby when the police
officers spoke to his mother,
I am quite unable to find that he heard what they
said to her and hence it seems to me I must approach my task under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90</a> upon
the basis that, when he said what he did by way of admission at his home, the
accused did not appreciate he was speaking to
police officers.  By the time
that he was spoken to at the police station and made the further admissions
about which Constable French
gave evidence, the accused did know that he was
addressing a police officer.  However the terms of the exchange with Constable
French
at the police station reveal that the police officer was told by the
young boy that he did not understand that what he said to the
police officer
could be used in a court.  Constable French endeavoured to explain what he
meant by this, but reflecting on what he
went on to say to the boy, and I have
set this out earlier, I am not satisfied that by his explanation to the effect
that if the
child told him something to indicate he had done something bad to
the deceased he might have to go to court, this made it clear that
the account
that the boy subsequently gave could be repeated as evidence against him in
later proceedings in court.
<P>

30  	There can be no question but that at the time Constable French
spoke to the accused at the police station it was only fair
and proper that the
boy be adequately cautioned before being questioned and in all the
circumstances, having regard to the child's
age and what emerges from Dr
Langeluddecke's report and the terms of such caution as was given, with its
inadequacies, I have concluded
that it would be unfair to the accused to permit
evidence to be given concerning the admissions which Constable French says that
he made whilst he was at the police station.
<P>

31  	I have also concluded that I should exclude part of what the
accused said to the police officer at his home.  I do not consider
there is any
unfairness for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90</a> such as would call for the exclusion of
what was first said by way of admission, accepting as I do that neither police
officer entertained
any suspicion when they called at the accused's home that
he had been guilty of any offence.  Neither police officer had any
responsibility
to give the child any caution at any time before the child first
said in the presence of the police officers that he pushed the deceased
in the
creek.  I am referring here to the admission to that effect made by the child
after his mother called him back to the front
door, he having earlier said
<i>"Sure, I pushed him."</i>  I am satisfied, having listened to the police
officers, that the accused freely volunteered the admissions referred to by
Constable
French in paragraphs 15 and 16 of his statement as set out above.  I
am satisfied as to the reliability of those admissions also.
<P>

32  	Having considered all the circumstances, I do not consider that
I should exercise a discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90</a> to exclude from evidence these
admissions first made by the accused at his home which I have identified.
<P>

33  	However, after the accused had said that he pushed the child in
the creek, it was in response to Constable French's further
question (in
paragraph 17 of his statement) that the child went on to make the further
admission having first asserted that "the
two boys" earlier kicked and punched
the deceased.  I consider that I should refuse to admit the evidence of this
further admission
because before the police officer asked the question which
elicited the further admissions the child had admitted wrongdoing in admitting
having pushed the deceased in the creek.  In all the circumstances, and having
regard to the child's age and his impaired functioning,
it seems to me that
before the police officer asked the child the question which elicited the
further admission, he ought to have
been given some caution in language that
the child understood.
<P>

34  	Although I have concluded that I should exclude from evidence
those admissions I have identified, in the exercise of my discretion
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
90</a>, this reflects no criticism of the manner in which either police officer
conducted himself.  I record that Mr Zahra concedes that
there was no relevant
failure to comply with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal
Proceedings) Act 1987</a></i> in respect of this accused.  However, in all the
circumstances relevant to the exercise of my discretion under s 90, I have
decided
that it is appropriate to exclude those later admissions which I have
been considering.  
<P>

35  	Mr Zahra next submitted that the evidence by way of admissions
should be excluded under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  This section
provides:
<P>

<i>"(1)   This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to
evidence of an admission made by a defendant: </i>
<P>

<i>(a)   in the course of official questioning, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   as a result of an act of another person who is capable of influencing
the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should
be brought or should
be continued. </i>
<P>

<i>(2)   Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances
in which the admission was made were such as to make it
unlikely that the truth
of the admission was adversely affected. </i>
<P>

<i>(3)   Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for
the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:
</i>
<P>

<i>(a)   any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the
admission, including age, personality and education and
any mental,
intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be
subject, and </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   if the admission was made in response to questioning: </i>
<P>

<i>(i)    the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put,
and </i>
<P>

<i>(ii)   the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the
person questioned."</i>
<P>

36  	Having concluded that it is only the first and the second of the
admissions which ought to be otherwise allowed into evidence,
it is relevant
for present purposes to consider only these admissions in the context of a
consideration of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85.</a>  Mr Zahra conceded that these admissions were not in the
course of "official questioning" but he submitted that they were elicited
in
circumstances attracting <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(1)(b).</a> Even if I assume this to be so, it is
necessary to determine for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(2)</a> whether the circumstances in
which the admissions were made were such "as to make it unlikely that the truth
of [each] admission
was adversely affected."  In considering this question I
take into account those matters addressed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(3).</a>  This involves of course
a consideration of those characteristics of this accused such as are addressed
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(3)(a).</a>  However I also must take into account how the accused came to
make the admissions and the terms of the exchanges in the conversation
in which
they were made.
<P>

37  	I accept each of the police officers to have given truthful and
reliable evidence on the voir dire and making due allowance
for the
characteristics of the accused, I do not consider that there was anything in
the circumstances in which the boy said what
he did that would affect in any
adverse way the truthfulness of the child's utterances.  I reject the
submission that I should regard
the child as having been intimidated by the
police officers.  There is no evidence such as would warrant that finding and
there is
nothing in the demeanour or the accounts of either police officer
which would lead me to conclude that their presence or the questions
that were
asked would have adversely affected the reliability of what the child said.
<P>

38  	I am satisfied for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(2)</a> that the
circumstances in which the child made the admissions which I propose to allow
into evidence were such as to make it unlikely
that the truth of these
admissions was adversely affected.  Hence Mr Zahra's submissions under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85</a>
fail.
<P>

39  	Mr Zahra next relied upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 137</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">138</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></i>.  Mr Zahra did not address me at any length as to the significance of
either section in the present context.  I do not consider that
the evidence I
otherwise propose to allow by way of admissions should be excluded either under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 137</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 138.</a>  
<P>

40  	For the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 137</a>, I reject the submission that the
probative value of the evidence that the prosecution seeks to introduce is
outweighed by the danger
of unfair prejudice to the defendant. I consider that
this evidence by way of admissions is properly admissible.  It has a very
significant
probative value and it seems to me that there is no real risk that
the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way.
<P>

41  	For the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 138</a>, I do not consider that the evidence I
otherwise propose to allow to be introduced was obtained improperly or in
circumstances attracting
adverse consideration under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 138.</a>  The evidence has
the probative value I have assessed, and there is nothing in the manner in
which it was obtained which would warrant
its exclusion under this section.
<P>

42  	Finally Mr Zahra referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 139(5).</a>  I set out <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 139(1)</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">139</a>(5):
<P>

<i>"(1)   For the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 138(1)(a)</a>, evidence of a statement made
or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained
improperly if: </i>
<P>

<i>(a)   the person was under arrest for an offence at the time, and </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who was at
the time empowered, because of the office that he or she
held, to arrest the
person, and </i>
<P>

<i>(c)   before starting the questioning the investigating official did not
caution the person that the person does not have to say or
do anything but that
anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence... </i>
<P>

<i> (5)   A reference in subsection (1) to a person who is under arrest
includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an
investigating
official for the purpose of being questioned, if: </i>
<P>

<i>(a)   the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish
that the person has committed an offence that is to be
the subject of the
questioning, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)   the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished
to do so, or </i>
<P>

<i>(c)   the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing
that the person would not be allowed to leave if he or she
wished to do
so."</i>
<P>

43  	The submission based upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 139(5)</a> proceeded upon the basis that
after the child had admitted that he had pushed the deceased in the creek, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
139(5)</a> was enlivened.  However, I have already determined that what was said
thereafter by way of admission ought to be excluded under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90.</a>  Consideration
of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 139</a> would not warrant the exclusion of anything that the
child said before he first walked away or after in response to his mother's
call for him to return he did so and said <i>"I pushed him in the creek, so
what."</i>  I reject the submission that the evidence by way of admissions
which I have otherwise decided is properly admissible should be regarded
as
having been improperly obtained for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 139.</a>  As I have already
indicated, I am satisfied that until these admissions had been made by the
accused neither police officer who
attended his home entertained any suspicion
that the accused had committed any criminal offence.
<P>

44  	For the above reasons I have decided that the Crown ought to be
permitted to adduce evidence of the matters referred to in
paragraphs 13, 14,
15 and 16 of Constable French's statement.  I will, however, not allow evidence
to be introduced as to the substance
of what was said by the accused as
referred to in paragraphs 17 and 27 of that statement.
