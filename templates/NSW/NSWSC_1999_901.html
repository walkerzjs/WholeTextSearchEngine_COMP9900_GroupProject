<b><u>30035/99 - BANKSTOWN CHATSWOOD RIFLE CLUB INC v COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
NSW</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The plaintiff has the benefit of certain
approvals made by the Commissioner of Police ("the Commissioner") under the
provisions
of the New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/fr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Firearms (General) Regulation 1997</a> ("the
Regulation").  The Commissioner has stated an intention to revoke those
approvals.  The plaintiff claims an order prohibiting
the Commissioner from
doing so.
<P>

2  	By each of three instruments signed on 25 September 1997 by the
Director of the Firearms Registry of the New South Wales Police
Service, the
Commissioner approved the plaintiff under the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/fr1997248/index.html#p9" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 9</a> of the
Regulation as a Target Shooting Club, as a Hunting Club and as a Collecting
Club.
<P>

3  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/fr1997248/index.html#p9" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 9</a> of the Regulation is in the following terms -
<P>

<b>Approval of clubs</b>
<P>

<b>77 Definition</b>
<P>

In this Part:
<P>

<b>club</b> means:
<P>

(a)	in relation to the genuine reason of sport/target shooting--a shooting
club, or
<P>

(b)	in relation to the genuine reason of recreational hunting/vermin control--a
hunting club, or
<P>

(c)	in relation to the genuine reason of firearms collection--a collectors'
society or collectors' club,
<P>

that has been established for not less than 3 months.
<P>

<b>78 Approval of club</b>
<P>

	(1)	An application for the Commissioner's approval of a club may be made by
the secretary of the club (or other relevant office
holder if there is no
secretary) by lodging with the Commissioner an application in the approved
form, together with:
<P>

		(a)	a certificate given by the applicant in the approved form setting out the
full name, date of birth and residential address
of each member of the club,
and
<P>

		(b)	a copy of the rules of the club, and
<P>

		(c)	such other information and documents as the Commissioner may require.
<P>

	(2)	The Commissioner may:
<P>

		(a)	grant the approval either unconditionally or subject to such conditions
as the Commissioner thinks fit, or
<P>

		(b)	refuse the application.
<P>

(3)	The Commissioner must not grant an approval unless;
<P>

		(a)	the club concerned consists of 10 or more members, and
<P>

		(b)	the club's rules are appropriate in the Commissioner's opinion, and
<P>

		(c)	the Commissioner is satisfied that:
<P>

			(i)	the club has a genuine and proper constitution, and
<P>

			(ii)	the club will conduct its activities with proper regard  to the
preservation of public safety or the peace, and
<P>

			(iii)	the club will conduct regular meetings and activities; and
<P>

			(iv)	the club will maintain adequate public liability and member insurance,
and
<P>

		(d)	the club is affiliated with one of the following associations and the
association concerned has recommended the granting of
the approval:
<P>

(there follows a list of associations including National Rifle Association of
Australia Limited and NSW Rifle Association Inc.)
<P>

	(4)	In considering whether to grant an approval, the Commissioner may have
regard to any training activities undertaken by the
club.
<P>

	(5)	Despite clause 78 (3) (d), the Commissioner may grant an approval if the
club concerned:
<P>

		(a)	operates outside New South Wales, and
<P>

		(b)	meets all the other criteria for approval under this clause.
<P>

<b>79 Revocation of approval of club</b>
<P>

(1)	The Commissioner may revoke an approval of a club for such reason as the
Commissioner thinks fit.
<P>

(2)	Without limiting subclause (1), the Commissioner may revoke an approval
if:
<P>

	(a)	the Commissioner is satisfied that the number of active members of the
club is less than 10, or
<P>

	(b)	the Commissioner is satisfied that the club is not being conducted with
proper regard to the preservation of public safety
or the peace, or
<P>

	(c)	the Commissioner is satisfied that any conditions to which the approval is
subject have not been complied with, or
<P>

	(d)	any member of the club is convicted of an offence under the Act or this
Regulation, or any previous firearms law of New South
Wales, or an offence
under the firearms law of any other jurisdiction (being an offence that, had it
been committed in New South
Wales, would be an offence under the law of New
South Wales), and the member has not been disqualified by the club as a member,
or
<P>

	(e)	the Commissioner becomes aware that any member of the club has, within the
period of 10 years before the approval was granted,
been convicted of an
offence referred to in paragraph (d) and has not been disqualified by the club
as a member.
<P>

(3)	The revocation of an approval of a club may be recommended to the
Commissioner by the association in respect of which the club
is affiliated.
<P>

(4)	Revocation of an approval takes effect when written notice of it is served
personally or by post on the secretary or other relevant
office holder of the
club concerned.
<P>

4  	After giving his approval, the Commissioner gave further
consideration to the provisions of cl 78(3)(b) and (c)(i).  On 6 May
1998 the
Director of the Firearms Registry wrote to the plaintiff in the following
terms, formal parts omitted -
<P>

I refer to your application for the above club to be recognised as an approved
target/hunting/collecting club in terms of clause
78 of the Firearms
Regulations, 1997.
<P>

A closer review of your club's constitution reveals the disciplines of hunting
and collecting are not provided for.  It will therefore
be necessary for the
constitution to be appropriately amended.
<P>

The approvals issued to your club on 26 March, 1998 for hunting and collecting
will remain operative for a period of three (3) months
i.e. 31 July, 1998,
after which time the approvals will be withdrawn.
<P>

Should you wish to continue with the approvals for hunting and collecting, you
should submit an amended constitution for review
by this office.
<P>

5  	There followed an exchange of letters.  The plaintiff asserted
that its constitutional powers were sufficient but the Director
was not
persuaded and said that notices of revocation would be served on the plaintiff.
So the plaintiff brought this summons.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff is a voluntary association of riflemen and was
originally organised at the beginning of this century under Commonwealth
defence legislation, now repealed.  On 3 April 1996 application was made under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act 1984</a>, New South Wales, for the incorporation
of the plaintiff.  The applicant stated that the objects of the association
were -
<P>

to promote rifle skills for defence; and
<P>

to promote membership of the National Rifle Association, NSW Rifle Association,
State, Territorial and District Rifle Associations
and Military Rifle
Associations.
<P>

7  	The principal activities of the association were stated to be
-
<P>

Rifle Competition and Instruction
<P>

8  	The applicant stated that the rules of the association were to be
the model rules provided for by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act</a>.
<P>

9  	The plaintiff was duly incorporated on 3 April 1996 and on 28
July 1997 changed its name to its present name.
<P>

10  	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19(1)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act</a> the objects of the
plaintiff became those stated in the application for incorporation.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19(2)</a>
the model rules became its rules.  The model rules say nothing about the
objects of an association to which they apply other than
to provide for their
alteration, etc: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 38.</a>
<P>

11  	The scheme of licensing persons to possess, use and collect
firearms and of approving clubs of such persons for particular
purposes is set
out in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Firearms Act 1996</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>") and the Regulation.
<P>

12  	The principles and objects of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a>, which
is in the following terms -
<P>

<b>3.   Principles and objects of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> </b>
<P>

(1)   The underlying principles of this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are:

	(a)	to confirm firearm possession and use as being a privilege that is
conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety,
and
<P>

	(b)	to improve public safety:
<P>

		(i)	by imposing strict controls on the possession and use of firearms, and
<P>

		(ii)	by promoting the safe and responsible storage and use of firearms,

<P>

	(c)	to facilitate a national approach to the control of firearms.
<P>

(2)	The objects of this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are as follows:
<P>

	(a)	to prohibit the possession and use of all automatic and self-loading
rifles and shotguns except in special circumstances,
<P>

	(b)	to establish an integrated licensing and registration scheme for all
firearms,
<P>

	(c)	to require each person who possesses or uses a firearm under the authority

or using the firearm,
<P>

	(d)	to provide strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to
licensing of firearms and the acquisition and sales of
firearms,
<P>

	(e)	to ensure that firearms are stored and conveyed in a safe and secure
manner,
<P>

	(f)	to provide for compensation in respect of, and an amnesty period to enable
the surrender of, certain prohibited firearms.
<P>

13  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 7</a> provides that a person must not possess or use a firearm
unless authorised to do so by a licence or permit.  The section provides
penalties for those who contravene its provisions.
<P>

14  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 4</a> defines certain terms, including the following -
<P>

"<b>possession</b>" of a firearm includes any case in which a person
knowingly:
<P>

(a)	has custody of the firearm, or 
<P>

(b)	has the firearm in the custody of another person, or 
<P>

(c)	has the firearm in or on any premises, place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft,
whether or not belonging to or occupied by the person.
<P>

"<b>use</b>" a firearm means fire the firearm or hold it so as to cause a
reasonable belief that it will be fired, whether or not it is capable
of being
fired.
<P>

15  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 8</a> provides for certain categories of licences and specifies
the firearms to which they apply and the authority they confer.  Three
kinds of
licences are relevant for present purposes and they are set out in the section
as follows -
<P>

<b>Category A licence</b>
<P>

<i>Firearms to which the licence applies:</i>
<P>

<P>

&#183;	rimfire rifles (other than self-loading),
<P>

<P>

&#183;	shotgun/rimfire rifle combinations.
<P>

All prohibited firearms are excluded from this licence category.
<P>

<i>Authority conferred by the licence:</i>
<P>

The licensee is authorised to possess or use a registered firearm of the kind
to which the licence applies, but only for the purpose
established by the
licensee as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the firearm.
<P>

<b>Category B licence</b>
<P>

<i>Firearms to which the licence applies:</i>
<P>

&#183;	muzzle-loading firearms (other than pistols)
<P>

<P>

All prohibited firearms are excluded from this licence category.
<P>

<i>Authority conferred by the licence:</i>
<P>

The licensee is authorised to possess or use a registered firearm of the kind
to which the licence applies, but only for the purpose
established by the
licensee as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the firearm. 
<P>

<b>Firearms collector licence</b>
<P>

<i>Firearms to which the licence applies:</i>
<P>

&#183;	the kinds of firearms specified in the licence.
<P>

Any pistol manufactured after 1 January 1946 is excluded from this licence
category.
<P>

Any prohibited firearm (other than those firearms to which a category C licence
or category D licence applies) is excluded from
this licence category. 
<P>

<i>Authority conferred by the licence:</i>
<P>

The licensee is authorised to possess the firearms to which the licence applies
for the purpose of a firearms collection.
<P>

16  	The genuine reasons that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(2)(c)</a> requires possessors or users
of firearms to have are dealt with in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 4</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a>.
<P>

17  	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a> a <b>genuine reason</b> means a genuine reason as
referred to in the Table to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12.</a>
<P>

18  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 12</a> is entitled <b>Genuine reasons for having a licence
</b>and, relevantly, provides as follows -
<P>

(1)	The Commissioner must not issue a licence that authorises the possession
and use of a firearm unless the Commissioner is satisfied
that the applicant
has a genuine reason for possessing or using the firearm. 
<P>

...
<P>

(4)	Subject to this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, an applicant for a licence has a genuine reason for
possessing or using a firearm if the applicant: 
<P>

	(a)	states that he or she intends to possess or use the firearm for any one or
more of the reasons set out in the Table to this
section, and 
<P>

	(b)	is able to produce evidence to the Commissioner that he or she satisfies
the requirements specified in respect of any such
reason.
<P>

19  	There follows a table in which available reasons are set out,
together with certain requirements applying to applicants for
licences who cite
those reasons.  The ones relevant to this summons are as follows.
<P>

<i>Reason: sport/target shooting</i>
<P>

The applicant must be a current member of a shooting club approved by the
Commissioner in accordance with the regulations, and which
conducts
competitions or activities requiring the use of the firearm for which the
licence is sought. 
<P>

<i>Reason: recreational hunting/vermin control</i>
<P>

The applicant must:
<P>

(a)	be the owner or occupier of rural land, or
<P>

(b)	produce proof of permission given by the owner or occupier of rural land,
or by an officer of the National Parks and Wildlife
Service, the Department of
Land and Water Conservation, the Forestry Commission or other authority
prescribed by the regulations,
to shoot on rural land, or 
<P>

(c)	be a current member of a hunting club approved by the Commissioner in
accordance with the regulations. 
<P>

The regulations may provide for the manner and form in which any such
permission is to be given, the extent to which it operates,
and how it is to be
produced as evidence by the applicant. A person does not, so long as the person
is authorised to give permission
to shoot on rural land, incur any liability
merely because the person gives the applicant permission to shoot on the land
concerned.
<P>

<i>Reason: firearms collection</i>
<P>

The applicant must:
<P>

(a)	demonstrate that the applicant's firearms collection has a genuine
commemorative, historical, thematic or financial value, and
<P>

(b)	be a current member of a collectors' society or club approved by the
Commissioner in accordance with the regulations.
<P>

20  	It was submitted by counsel for the Commissioner that an
individual applicant for a licence has to have a genuine reason for
possessing,
using or collecting a firearm.  If the genuine reason is sport/target shooting,
the applicant has to be a member of a
shooting club approved by the
Commissioner under the Regulation.  If the genuine reason is recreational
hunting/vermin control the
applicant must, unless other conditions are
satisfied which are not relevant here, be a member of a hunting club so
approved by the
Commissioner.  If the genuine reason is firearms collection the
applicant must be a member of a collectors' society or club so approved.
 The
Commissioner is prohibited from issuing a licence unless he is satisfied that
these conditions have been met.
<P>

21  	Cl 77 categorises clubs by reference to the genuine reasons of
sport/target shooting, recreational hunting/vermin control and
firearms
collection provided for by the table to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12.</a>  If a club cannot bring itself
within the appropriate category the Commissioner cannot approve it.  Under cl
78(2) the Commissioner
must not give approval to a club unless he is satisfied,
among other things, that the club's rules are appropriate in his opinion
and
that it has a genuine and proper constitution.
<P>

22  	Although the requirement that the club has a genuine and proper
constitution may mean no more than that the constitution should
ensure that the
business of the club will be conducted in a lawful and proper manner, the
requirement that the rules of the club
are appropriate must be read in the
legislative context, particularly cl 77.  For the purposes of cl 78(3)(b) the
plaintiff's rules
are wider than the model rules, which are to be construed in
the light of other relevant documents, including the statement of objects
in
the application for incorporation.  So construed, the rules provide for
sport/target shooting but do not provide for hunting or
collecting.  The
Commissioner would have been justified in withholding approvals of the
plaintiff as a hunting club and as a collectors'
club.  For the same reason,
the Commissioner is justified in revoking those approvals.
<P>

23  	Counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged the responsibility of the
Commissioner to look widely at the model rules and the other
documents but
asserted that the issue was really one about the power of the plaintiff to
carry out the activities of a hunting club
and a collectors' club.
<P>

24  	Counsel relied on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act</a>, which
invests an incorporated association with the rights, powers and privileges of a
natural person and, it was submitted, abolishes
the common law doctrine of
corporate ultra vires in its application to incorporated associations.  The
fact that an incorporated
association does an act prohibited by its rules may
be asserted or relied on only in the limited circumstances set forth in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
18(5)</a>, namely where a person is prosecuted for an offence against the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, in
proceedings against the association by a member, in proceedings by the
association or the member against a present or former
officer and in an
application by the Commissioner or by a member of the association to wind it
up.  So the assertion that the conduct
of the activities of the plaintiff are
beyond its powers is wrong in law and manifestly unreasonable in the
administrative sense.

Corporation</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1947/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] EWCA Civ 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%201%20KB%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 1 KB 223.</a>
<P>

25  	The Commissioner is unable to come to the opinion that the rules
of the plaintiff are appropriate.  For present purposes that
is tantamount to a
decision that they are not appropriate.  Such a decision is reviewable by the
Court if the Commissioner appears
to have acted arbitrarily or capriciously or
has misdirected himself in law or has failed to consider matters that he ought
to have
considered or has taken irrelevant matters into account.  In the
absence of any of those factors, the Court may interfere if the
decision
reached by the Commissioner appears so unreasonable that no reasonable
authority could properly have arrived at it.  <b><u>Buck v Bavone</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20135%20CLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 135 CLR 110</a> per Gibbs J at 118; <b><u>Bruce v Cole</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45
NSWLR 163</a> per Spigelman CJ at 184-185.
<P>

26  	It is implicit in the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff
that if the plaintiff has power to perform a function there
is no need for
rules which provide for the performance of that function.  It is unnecessary to
decide whether, as a general proposition,
that is correct.  I think that the
submission confuses the questions whether the plaintiff has power to perform a
function and whether
it is obliged by cl 78(1)(b) to furnish to the
Commissioner rules which provide for the performance of that function.
<P>

27  	Many kinds of organisations of individuals may apply to the
Commissioner for approval as clubs.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and the Regulation say nothing
about how clubs may or must be constituted.  They do not need to be
corporations or incorporated associations.
 There is no special requirement of
formality.  Although an applicant club must furnish written rules under the
provisions of cl
78(1)(b), the legislation does not prescribe the form or
content of such rules.
<P>

28  	I accept the submissions of counsel that when considering the
appropriateness of the rules of an applicant club the Commissioner
is concerned
with more than just whether the rules have legal validity.  The Commissioner
must consider the whole of the circumstances
before him.
<P>

29  	In considering whether a club's rules are appropriate the
Commissioner must have in mind the purposes of the legislation. 
Relevantly,
they are to ensure public safety by imposing strict controls on the possession
and use of firearms by promoting the safe
and responsible storage and use of
firearms.
<P>

30  	The Commissioner is obliged to satisfy himself about the matters
enumerated in cl 78(3) and is bound to withhold a grant of
approval unless he
is satisfied.  The rules which the Commissioner must consider might ordinarily
be expected to deal with a number
of such matters.  They might, for example,
say something about the manner in which the club carries out its activities
with regard
to the preservation of public safety or the peace
(subcl(3)(c)(ii)), about the regularity of its meetings and activities
((3)(c)(iii)),
or about insurance ((3)(c)(iv)).  They might say something about
affiliation with any of the associations listed in subcl(3)(d).
 They might
something of the club's training activities ((4)).
<P>

31  	Cl 81 of the Regulation places conditions on licensees who are
members of approved clubs.  During any period of twelve months
a member of a
shooting club must participate in no fewer than four shooting competitions and
attend a range no fewer than four time
(subcl(b)); during any period of twelve
months a member of a hunting club must participate in no fewer than two events
organised
by any approved hunting club involving hunting, shooting or firearms
safety training ((c)); a member of a collectors' club must attend
the club's
annual meeting or at least one other meeting over any period of twelve months
((d)).
<P>

32  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1996102/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 12</a> requires a shooting club to conduct competitions and
activities requiring the use of the firearm for which any applicant seeks a
licence.
<P>

33  	All these are matters which may be provided for in the rules of
clubs.  To the extent to which they are or are not so provided
for, the
Commissioner may be assisted in coming to a decision whether the rules are
appropriate.
<P>

34  	The rules of a club may stand alone and complete or they may be
understandable only by reference to other documents, as it
the case here.  The
model rules say nothing about shooting or hunting or collecting firearms.  For
the purposes of cl 78(1)(b) and
(3)(b), therefore, the plaintiff's rules must
be taken to comprise not only the model rules but also the objects and
principal activities
stated in the application for incorporation.
<P>

35  	They make the plaintiff a club whose object is to promote rifle
skills for defence by rifle competition and instruction.  It
is not a matter of
contention that the Commissioner construes the rules as of a shooting club.
<P>

36  	However, nothing in the statement of objects or principal
activities states expressly or impliedly that the plaintiff is or
may also be a
hunting club or a collectors' club.  The subjects of recreational hunting,
vermin control and firearms collection are
nowhere mentioned.
<P>

37  	Contrary to the submission of counsel for the plaintiff, there
has been no confusion of corporate power and corporate purpose.
 There has been
no assertion by the Commissioner that the plaintiff's conduct and activities
are beyond its powers.  Those are not
matters about which the Commissioner is
or needs to be concerned.  It does not seem to me that, in deciding that the
rules are not
appropriate to a hunting club or a collectors' club, the
Commissioner has acted other than in good faith, has misdirected himself
in
law, has failed to consider relevant matters or has considered irrelevant
matters.  I do not think it possible to say that no
reasonable authority could
properly have arrived at the opinion of the Commissioner.
<P>

38  	The summons is accordingly dismissed.  The plaintiff must pay
the Commissioner's costs in an amount to be agreed or assessed.
<P>
