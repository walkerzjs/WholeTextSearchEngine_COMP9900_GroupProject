<br><br><br><b>THE SUPREME COURT</b><br><b>OF NEW SOUTH
WALES</b><br><b>ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DIVISION</b><br><b>DUNFORD J</b><br><b>1
APRIL 1999</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u>30014/99 - Liliana CERNAIANU v Residential Tenancies
Tribunal &amp; Ors</u></b><br><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></p>
<p>1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an application by the second and third
defendants for summary dismissal of the proceedings brought in this Court by the
plaintiff pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules, Part 13, rule 5(1).<br>2	The
background to the matter is that the plaintiff and, it appears her husband also,
were tenants of the second and third defendants
of premises at 2/5 Bowman
Street, Richmond pursuant to a residential tenancy agreement.<br>3	In late 1998
the plaintiff and her husband made an application for an order that the rent was
excessive from April 1995 to September
1998 because a service, namely the hot
water service, provided with the premises had been reduced.  They sought
compensation for
economic loss in the sum of $1307.18 and compensation for
non-economic loss in the sum of $1000 as a result thereof.<br>4	As the
application was made more than thirty days after they first became aware of the
breach, they also sought an extension of
time for bringing the application
pursuant to s 16 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a> (the Act)</i></b>. 
That application was determined on 6 January 1999 and the reasons of the
Tribunal are before me as Ex 1.  The Tribunal's orders
were that the application
be dismissed.<br>5	These proceedings were commenced on 2 February this year by
Summons and the plaintiff is seeking an order to set aside the order
made by the
Tribunal on 6 January 1999 and an order that the Tribunal had denied her natural
justice.  The Summons was supported
by an affidavit of the plaintiff claiming
she had been denied natural justice by the Tribunal; that the Tribunal had
failed to consider
all the orders sought by her and her husband and did not give
them an opportunity to fully present their claims.<br>6	In the meantime the
second and third defendants had caused to be served on the plaintiff and her
husband a Notice of Termination
on the grounds of arrears of rent and on 11
January 1999 the landlords made an application to the Tribunal for an order for
possession
pursuant to such Notice of Termination.<br>7	On 23 February 1999 that
application was adjourned, but interim orders were made directing the payment of
arrears of rent of $520,
and that the current rent be paid as it fell due.  On
10 March an Amended Summons was filed, but this merely added the second and
third defendants as parties to the previous summons only naming the
Tribunal.<br>8	Meanwhile on 8 March a Notice of Motion was filed in Court and a
further Notice of Motion filed in Registry on 10 March both seeking
an order to
set aside the "final orders" by the Tribunal of the 23 February 1999, and an
order that the Tribunal had denied the tenants
natural justice.  The reasons of
the Tribunal dated 23 February 1999 are before me as Ex 2.<br>9	There is further
affidavit evidence, namely an affidavit of the plaintiff of 9 March saying that
she was denied natural justice
because the Tribunal did not call all the
evidence presented to it and it erred because it did not give the applicants the
opportunity
to fully present their case and a further affidavit sworn 23 March
going into the facts of the matter in some detail.  <br>10	I turn first to the
orders made on 23 February 1999 and note that these proceedings related to the
alleged failure of the hot water
system.  The Tribunal, in effect, found that no
complaint had been made about the hot water system until September 1998, and
that
it was then promptly repaired.<br>11	The Tribunal also found that as the
direct evidence given by the tenants was that the hot water system has been
defective since
the commencement of tenancy, there was no evidence of
progressive deterioration of the service and so there could not have been a
withdrawal by the landlords of any goods, services or facilities such as would
justify a rent reduction based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47(1)</a> of <b><i>the
Act</i></b>.<br>12	Accordingly the Tribunal found that this was not an
appropriate case for an extension of time to permit the claim for compensation
for breach of the tenancy agreement and that, as there had been no withdrawal of
goods, services or facilities, the claim for reduction
of rent failed.<br>13	It
is important to bear in mind that the only appeal to this Court from a decision
of the Tribunal is one in relation to a matter
of law: s 107.  I have read the
Reasons of the Tribunal for its decision of 6 January 1999 and I can find no
evidence of any error
of law or of any denial of natural justice.<br>14	In
particular Mrs Cernaianu referred to a thirteen page submission which she
claimed the Tribunal member apparently had not read
although he adjourned the
hearing for some time for the purpose of reading it.  At the top of p 4 of the
Reasons the Tribunal expressly
says that those submissions were taken into
account.<br>15	In relation to the proceedings of 23 February 1999 - there was
reference to the failure of the Tribunal to examine a video alleged
to relate to
the damage to the hot water system but I note in the Reasons at p 5 the Tribunal
sets out a finding favourable to the
tenants of the state of the hot water
system as at that time, including water on the floor and electrical wires
immersed in water.
 It is difficult to see what further material matter could
have been disclosed by the video.<br>16	In relation to the proceedings on 23
February 1999, in those proceedings the landlords sought an order terminating
the tenancy
agreement, giving possession to the landlords and consequential
orders.  I have examined the Reasons of the Tribunal and once again
I can find
no error of law or denial of natural justice.<br>17	It is convenient, however,
that I refer to a couple of particular issues raised by Mrs Cernaianu.  At p 4
of the Reasons of 23
February 1999 it is noted that it was agreed between the
parties that, when the Notice of Termination was served on 7 December, the
rent
was eighteen days in arrears and, at the foot of the same page, the Tribunal
explained to the parties that the issues of termination
and possession <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 64(4))</a>
and the issue of retaliation <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 65(2))</a> would have to be determined on another
occasion and further witnesses could be called on behalf of the tenants on that
occasion to
prove their case.<br>18	There was an argument as to waiver of the
requirement for the rent to be paid weekly, but the Reasons disclose that the
relevant
correspondence was taken into account and once again I can see no error
of law.<br>19	The only orders made by the Tribunal on that occasion were that
the landlords were entitled to issue a Notice of Termination pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> of
<b><i>the Act</i></b>, that the issue of retaliation was adjourned to another
day and, in the meantime, the tenant was ordered to pay the rent arrears
of $520
by 5 March 1999.  In view of what was said at p 4, referred to above, I also
understand that it was intended the issues of
termination and possession were
also stood over for another day.<br>20	Once again Mrs Cernaianu had drawn my
attention to a number of alleged defects in the proceedings but, as I say, I can
see no error
of law or denial of natural justice flowing from the Reasons.  One
claim is that the Tribunal miscalculated the rent arrears which,
it is said,
were only $500 not $520.  That was a matter of fact within the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal to determine.<br>21	A Romanian/French interpreter was furnished
whom the tenants had requested not be supplied, but there is no satisfactory
evidence
before me that the use of that interpreter significantly prejudiced the
plaintiff and her husband even though the assertion is made.<br>22	As I say the
perusal of the Reasons discloses no error of law or denial of natural justice. 
It has been suggested that the Reasons
do not correctly represent what
transpired at the hearing but no justification has been shown for me to go
behind those Reasons.<br>23	It is said that the main thrust of the submissions
on behalf of the plaintiff is that the Tribunal did not take into account
various
parts of the evidence which were available but, when the submission is
analysed closely, it appears to amount to no more than a submission
that the
Tribunal came to the wrong decision.<br>24	As I say, there is no appeal on
matters of fact and I can see no error of law.  All the submissions of Mrs
Cernaianu before me
have been recorded in the transcript and will be available
if required.  I therefore am satisfied that the present second and third
defendants are entitled to summary judgment.<br>25	I make an order under SCR
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a> that the proceedings be dismissed, and I order the plaintiff to
pay the second and third defendants' costs of the proceedings.<br></p>
