<P>

<i>Tuesday, 30 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1642/99 - 	AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION  -v-  BARRACK
MORTGAGE MANAGERS PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>1643/99 - AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION  v  CREDIT
ALLIANCE PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>1644/99 - AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION   v  W G HERLE
PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> In each of these three matters the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission has filed a summons seeking the winding up of
the
defendant upon the ground set forth in section 461(1)(k) of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>, that ground being that the Court is of opinion that it is just and
equitable that the company be wound up. 
<P>

2	I have been taken to the judgment of his Honour Justice Finn in the Federal
Court of Australia in <i>Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1663.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1663</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%201822" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 1822.</a>  I would respectfully agree with the view
expressed by his Honour in that decision that the just and equitable ground has
an appropriate
role to serve as an instrument of investor protection. 
<P>

3	The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has a role of protecting
the investing public as a matter of public interest.
It therefore has the
standing to bring about a winding up of a company upon the just and equitable
ground.
<P>

4	His Honour in that case said that a court entertaining an application by the
Australian Securities Commission (the statutory predecessor
to the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission), grounded on considerations of public
interest, had to evaluate the reasons
put forward by the Commission, in order
to form a view on whether they did afford sufficient reasons for making a
winding up order
on the just and equitable ground.
<P>

5	In the instant case, none of the three defendants has seen fit to appear.
The evidence discloses a consistently series of breaches
of the <i>Corporations
Law </i>in the case of each of the companies. Those breaches include improper
dealings with moneys raised from the public, failure to keep
or to produce
appropriate records, and failure to provide that degree of basic public
accountability as to the operations of each
of the companies as is required
under the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

6	It is clear from the evidence that one Damien Parkes, an undischarged
bankrupt, has been involved in the management of all three
companies.  Indeed,
it is clear that he has had the control of the three companies.  The persons
who nominally have been directors
of the companies have, in fact, been denied
the capacity to operate as such, and have on occasions even been refused by Mr
Parkes
access to the books and records of the companies.
<P>

7	At the present time none of the companies has any directors, none of the
companies has filed annual reports.  The records of Credit
Alliance Pty.
Limited are false. That company has ceased to trade, and its assets either have
been or are to be transferred to W
G Herle Pty. Limited, leaving Credit
Alliance Pty. Limited only with debts.  The records of Credit Alliance Pty.
Limited are being
destroyed.  The plaintiff has been denied access to such
books and records of Credit Alliance Pty. Limited as may exist.  None of
the
three companies appears to have been operating at its registered office or to
have been trading at its principal place of business.
<P>

8	It appears that the aforesaid Damien Parkes, an undischarged bankrupt, has
been using for his own purposes moneys raised from
the public by one or more of
the three companies.  
<P>

9	I am in entire agreement with the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff
that it is in the public interest that each of these
three companies be wound
up forthwith, so that the public can be protected from the conduct which has
been perpetrated by the aforesaid
Damien Parkes. Further, that an official
liquidator be appointed, who will thoroughly investigate the affairs of the
companies, to
ascertain their assets and liabilities, to ascertain the
whereabouts of their books and records, to ascertain whether any transactions
into which the companies have purported to enter are capable of being
challenged, and, most importantly, to ascertain whether any
further or other
breaches of the <i>Corporations Law</i> or of any other law have been committed
by any person who has been involved in the management or control of the
companies.
<P>

10	I propose to make an order in each case for the winding up of the company
and for the appointment of an official liquidator.
<P>

11	In each matter I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I make an order as in paragraph 1 in the Notice of 	Motion filed by the
plaintiff on 10 March 1999.
<P>

	2.	I order that the defendant be wound up pursuant to 	section  461(1)(k) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

	3.	I order that Steven John Sherman of Ferrier 	Hodgson, Level 17, 2 Market
Street, Sydney, be 	appointed liquidator of the defendant.
<P>

	4.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the 	plaintiff.
<P>

12	      The exhibits should remain with the Court file.
<P>
