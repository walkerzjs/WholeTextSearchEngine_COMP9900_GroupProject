<b><u>13617/91 - Richard SEARY  v  Tom MOLOMBY</u></b>
<P>

	<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	In these proceedings Mr. Richard Seary, ["the
plaintiff"], sues to recover damages for libel. The matter of which the
plaintiff complains
is the entirety of a book entitled <i>"Spies Bombs and the
Path of Bliss"</i>. The book, ["the subject book"], was published in 1986, its
author being Mr. Tom Molomby, ["the defendant"], whom the plaintiff sued
originally as one of two defendants, the other defendant being the author of a
Foreword to the subject book. The plaintiff originally
sued upon two alleged
defamatory imputations, which were pleaded in the following terms:
<P>

"(a)	The Plaintiff is a murderer.
<P>

 (b)	The Plaintiff framed members of the Ananda Marga by committing
perjury."
<P>

2  	On 23 August last the Court, in a reserved judgment, dealt with
certain questions that had been separately tried following upon
the making of
an order in that behalf and pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p51" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51.</a> The effect of that
judgment was that the plaintiff's case against the author of the Foreword
failed; as did the plaintiff's case
against both defendants in so far as it
relied upon the imputation (a) as pleaded. The Court held, however, that the
imputation (b)
as pleaded was carried in fact by the contents of the subject
book; and was, further, defamatory of the plaintiff.
<P>

3  	Following the delivery of its reserved judgment, the Court heard
the balance of the plaintiff's case against the defendant.
That entailed, so
far as the plaintiff was concerned, a consideration of the issue of damages;
and of the issue of malice as a factor
defeating the various defences pleaded
by the defendant. The continued hearing entailed, so far as the defendant was
concerned, a
consideration of the defences of: qualified privilege at Common
Law; statutory qualified privilege pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a> (NSW)</b>, ["the Act"]; comment; justification; and contextual truth.
<P>

4  	This present judgment will deal first with the defences,
considering them in the order in which they were presented in the closing
submissions of the defendant; and will then consider malice and damages.
<P>

5  	Before embarking upon the consideration of any of those
particular issues, it is necessary to describe the general background
to them.
This can be done initially by reproducing paragraph 34 of the judgment
delivered on 23 August:
<P>

"Then in February 1978, despite an extensive security operation, a bomb
exploded in a garbage bin outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney
where various
Commonwealth heads of Government, including the Indian Prime Minister, Morarji
Desai, were gathered.  Three people
were killed and several seriously injured.
Almost immediately, Ananda Marga was blamed.  The Indian Prime Minister himself
accused
it, though conceding that he had no evidence.  An enormous
investigation was begun.
<P>

Into this unstable and volatile situation came a figure from the shadows, a
young man named Richard Seary, a former drug addict,
a drifter and dreamer with
a shifting sense of reality.  Within weeks of the Hilton bombing, he had joined
Ananda Marga as a police
informer; his mission was to find out if they had
anything to do with the Hilton bombing.
<P>

Time went by, and though Seary reported regularly, he had nothing about the
Hilton bombing.  But after some three and a half months
he contacted the police
late one afternoon, and told them that there was to be a bombing that night.
He himself was to drive the
car for the expedition.  Acting on Seary's
information, the police followed the car and pulled it over.  There was a bomb
in the
back seat.  Seary said that the others had brought it; they said that,
unknown to them, he had brought it.  Some days later Seary
added to his account
of events that night the allegation that during the journey the others had
confessed to having done the Hilton
 bombing.
<P>

That is the case at the centre of this book.  To what extent its circumstances
were the creation of the devious mind of Richard
Seary is the essential
judgment which the reader will have to make."
<P>

6  	The so-described <i>"case at the centre of"</i> the subject book
gave rise to a connected sequence of legal proceedings. Three young men, named
Anderson, Alister and Dunn, were
charged with conspiracy to murder, and two of
them were charged with attempted murder, in connection with the projected
bombing which
the plaintiff reported to the police. This bombing was to be
carried out, according to the plaintiff's report of it to the police,
at
Yagoona, an outer Sydney suburb. The three men were committed for trial upon
those charges. They were tried, subsequently and
upon indictment, on two
occasions. At their first trial, the jury could not agree upon any verdict. At
the second trial, all three
men were found guilty, and were sentenced thereupon
to substantial terms of imprisonment. The convictions and sentences were
appealed
unsuccessfully, both to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal
and to the High Court of Australia.
<P>

7  	Later, and as a consequence of sustained public and political
agitation, a judicial inquiry was established and was conducted
by Wood J of
this Court (as his Honour then was). The report of that inquiry found that
reasonable doubt existed as to the soundness
of all of the convictions; and
thereupon the three men, - (<i>"the Ananda Marga three",</i> as they have come
to be described frequently), - were released after having spent some years in
prison.
<P>

8  	Between the dismissal by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the
appeals brought to that Court, and the further appeals to the High
Court, a
coronial inquest was held into the deaths resulting from the Hilton Hotel
bombing. That inquest was terminated by the Coroner,
and as by law required,
upon the finding by the Coroner of a <i>prima facie</i> case of murder against
Messrs. Alister and Dunn.
<P>

9  	The plaintiff was a crucial prosecution witness in the committal
and in the two subsequent trials; and was an equally important
witness both at
the coronial inquest and at the judicial inquiry conducted by Wood J. 
<P>

10  	This standing of the plaintiff made him a figure of tremendous
forensic controversy. Those who appeared professionally at various
times for
the three accused men sought, as they had, of course, to do, to discredit the
plaintiff. He was attacked as a fantasist
at  best; a cold-blooded liar and
perjurer at worst. Any opinion concerning the probity of the prosecutions of
the three accused
men became, - and as the present hearing demonstrates,
continues to be, - inextricably interwoven with opinion about the probity
of
the evidence given by the plaintiff in the five sets of proceedings earlier
described.
<P>

11  	The subject book, whatever else is to be said fairly about its
contents, is a paradigm of that interweaving.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Qualified Privilege at Common Law</u></b>
<P>

12  	It is convenient to begin by noting the terms in which this
defence was pleaded and particularised by the defendant:
<P>

"(i)	<u>COMMON LAW</u> 
<P>

	the Defendant published the matter complained of pursuant to the social or
moral duty of do <i>(sic)</i> so and specifically, to inform that section of
the community that had a special interest in the public and parliamentary
debate on
the issued particularised herein under `Public Interest'. The
recipients of the matter complained of had a special interest in receiving
the
matter complained of because they were members of the public and because the
matter complained of related to the matters of public
interest stated above,
and because of the extreme seriousness of the problems relating to the
administration of justice, which affected
a substantial section of the
Australian community."
<P>

13  	The particulars of `Public Interest' referred to in that
pleading are stated as follows:
<P>

"(i)	the conduct of the Plaintiff as a spy and/or double agent to expose
criminal conduct;
<P>

(ii)	the conduct of the New South Wales judicial system;
<P>

(iii)	the circumstances in which three members of Ananda Marga namely Dunn,
Anderson, and Alister, came to be wrongfully arrested
for and accused of crimes
as a result of the wrongful or perjured testimony of the Plaintiff;
<P>

(iv)	investigation of serious crime; and
<P>

these matters were all inherently matters of public interest."
<P>

14  	It is necessary to keep in mind when considering the defence
thus pleaded and particularised two propositions, namely:
<P>

(1)	that the occasion said to have been one of qualified privilege was the
occasion of the publication in 1986 of the subject book.
(The fact of its
having been published by the defendant, although denied on the pleadings, was
in fact not disputed at the hearing.)
<P>

(2)	that the incidents of that occasion which are said to attract the relevant
privilege are the existence of a duty in the defendant
to publish the subject
book, and a corresponding interest in recipients of the book to have published
to them the contents of the
subject book, and the defamatory imputation now
relevant and conveyed by the subject book.
<P>

15  	The relevant principles of law which have then to be applied to
the defence as thus understood are not easy of particular and
practical
application in the present case; but they are at least reasonably well-settled
in theory. They can be summarised conveniently
by reference to the relevant
portions of the judgment of McHugh J in <b>Stephens v West Australian
Newspapers Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20182%20CLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 182 CLR 211</a> at 260-264:
<P>

"At Common Law, it is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter that
the matter was published in good faith on an occasion
of qualified privilege.
Statements `fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private
duty, whether legal or moral,
or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters
where his interest is concerned' are privileged even though they contain untrue
defamatory statements. However, the defence of qualified privilege is generally
not available where defamatory matter is published
in a newspaper. At common
law, the defence is not open unless the recipient of the publication possessed
an interest in receiving
or was under a duty to receive the communication that
corresponded with the interest or duty of the person making the publication.
.........................................................................................................................................................................................................
<P>

Reciprocity of interest or duty is essential to a claim of qualified privilege
at common law. The need for reciprocity usually defeats
a claim of qualified
privilege where the publication has been made to the general public. Only in
exceptional cases does a person
have an interest or duty to publish defamatory
matter to the world at large. Both in Australia and elsewhere, common law
courts have
repeatedly held that a person has no legitimate interest or duty to
publish defamatory matter to the general public if no more is
established than
that the subject matter of the publication is one in which the public is
interested. In <b>Howe &amp; McColough v Lees</b>, Higgins J said that the word
`interest' was not used in any technical sense. However, his Honour said that
the person must not be
`interested in it as a matter of gossip or curiosity,
but as a matter of substance apart from its mere quality as news'. In the same
case, O'Connor J said that the interest must be `of so tangible a nature that
for the common convenience and welfare of society it
is expedient to protect
it'.
<P>

As the decided cases show, however, circumstances may exist where the interest
of the general public in a particular subject is
such that a defence of
qualified privilege is available even though the communication is made to the
general public by means of a
newspaper or other medium of general circulation.
If a subject is one of public interest, members of the public have the
requisite
interest in receiving information on that subject from persons who
have a corresponding interest or duty to communicate that information
to the
general public.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
<P>

In determining whether a person has a legal, social or moral interest or duty
to publish to the world at large, the extent of the
publication and the
proportion of readers who have a legitimate interest in receiving the
communication are relevant factors to be
weighed. It has long been established,
however, that qualified privilege is not lost simply because the communication
is read, seen
or heard by persons having  no legitimate interest in receiving
the communication. If publication in a newspaper or by radio or television
is
the only reasonable mode of communicating with the public, qualified privilege
will not be lost because it is read, seen or heard
by persons who have no
legitimate interest in receiving the communication.
<P>

Although, as the foregoing account of the case law demonstrates, the common law
has upheld defences of qualified privilege for publications
to the world at
large, common law courts have taken a restricted view of the occasions when a
person has an interest or duty to publish
material to the general public.
Protection of reputation has generally been preferred to the right of the
public to know. It is not
surprising that successive generations of common law
judges have been loath to extend the categories of qualified privilege to
protect
publication in the general media. Although the tort of defamation law
became established at an early stage in the history of common
law, the defence
of qualified privilege, as we know it, was not recognised until the first part
of the last century. New legal doctrines
take time to win general acceptance in
the legal profession, and the low quality and sensational nature of significant
parts of the
late nineteenth century and twentieth century media have not been
conducive to the extension of a defence that protects the publication
of untrue
defamatory material.  However, as Cockburn CJ is reported to have said `those
who administer [the law of qualified privilege]
must adapt to the varying
conditions of society'."
<P>

16  	When, as in the present case, the defaming publisher claims the
protection derived from a social or moral duty to publish,
it is important to
be clear about the nature and extent of such duty which the law will accept as
attracting the relevant privilege.
A useful analysis of both the relevant law
and the difficulties of its application is contained in the following passage
from the
judgment of Scrutton LJ in <b>Watt v Longsdon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281930%29%201%20KB%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1930) 1 KB 130</a> at
143-144:
<P>

"The question whether the occasion was privileged is for the judge, and so far
as `duty' is concerned, the question is: Was there
a duty, legal, moral or
social to communicate? As to legal duty, the judge should have no difficulty ;
the judge should know the
law; but as to moral or social duties of imperfect
obligation, the task is far more troublesome. The judge has no evidence as to
the view the community takes of moral or social duties. All the help the Court
of Appeal can give him is contained in the judgment
of Lindley LJ in <b>Stuart
v Bell</b>; `the question of moral or social duty being for the judge, each
judge must decide it as best he can for himself. I take moral or
social duty to
mean a duty recognised by English people of ordinary intelligence and moral
principle, but at the same time not a
duty enforceable by legal proceedings,
whether civil or criminal. ................. .
<P>

Is the Judge merely to give his own view of moral and social duty, though he
thinks a considerable portion of the community hold
a different opinion? Or is
he to endeavour to ascertain what view `the great mass of right-minded men'
would take? It is not surprising
that with such a standard both Judges and
text-writers treat the matter as one of great difficulty in which no definite
line can
be drawn."
<P>

17  	But, if <i>"no definite line can be drawn", </i>various judicial
attempts have been made to draw a broadly settled one. Those attempts do not go
ultimately, - and probably could
never do so, - beyond averring that everything
depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. A good example is
provided
in the following extract from the speech of Earl Loreburn LC in
<b>James v Baird</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281916%29%20SC%20%28HL%29%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1916) S.C (H.L) 158</a> at 163-164, as cited in <b>Gatley on
Libel and Slander</b>: Ninth Edition: at page [331]:
<P>

"In considering the question whether the occasion was an occasion of privilege,
the court will regard the alleged libel and will
examine to whom it was
published, when, why, and in what circumstances it was published, and will see
whether these things establish
a relation between the parties which gives rise
to a social or moral right or duty, and the consideration of these things may
involve
the consideration of questions of public policy."
<P>

18  	In the case of the subject book, the relevant circumstances and
considerations are, in my opinion, as follows:
<P>

(1)	The book was published in 1986. By that time the plaintiff's probity had
been subjected to sustained, repeated, searching, critical
and public
attack.
<P>

(2)	Findings adverse to the plaintiff's probity had been made, publicly, by
Wood J; and adverse comments about the plaintiff's probity
had been made,
publicly, by Murphy J in the High Court of Australia. All of those comments are
picked up in terms in the Foreword
to the subject book. 
<P>

(3)	By the time the subject book was published, Wood J had delivered his
Report; the Ananda Marga Three had been pardoned and released;
and the
plaintiff had departed the scene, burdened by his experiences, and having to
make, as best he could in the wake of those
experiences, something of the
remainder of his life.
<P>

(4)	The subject book shone a new, and a very sharp and unflattering light onto
the plaintiff. It characterised the plaintiff, in
the clearest and most
uncompromising fashion, as a wilful perjurer who had not scrupled to lie away
the liberty of three innocent
men. As I have earlier remarked, the subject book
interwove closely and tightly its criticisms of the plaintiff, and its
criticisms
of the police, and the security intelligence, services, and of the
judicial system. 
<P>

(5)	That those views of the defendant, expressed as trenchantly as they were in
fact, were views honestly and reasonably held, -
as the defendant of course
contends, and as I will assume for the purpose of the present particular
discussion, - cannot be, in my
opinion, decisive of the question whether there
was, in the requisite legal sense, a duty, social or moral, to give voice to
them.
<i>A fortiori</i>, when voice was so given in a book published to the
world at large, and under cover of a Foreword, written by an apparently
informed
and independent author, proclaiming to that same world at large that
the defendant <i>"with superb clarity, as in a diagram ......has preserved for
ever the injustice wrought on these three innocent men, and the evils
of their
wrong conviction"</i>.
<P>

	(6)	Nor can it be, in my opinion, decisive that the book was published for
lawful commercial gain to the defendant. But that is,
in my opinion, a factor
of some real weight. It would be wrong to see the publication of the subject
book as having been simply an
altruistic exercise.
<P>

	(7)	There was no particular, relevant personal relationship between the
plaintiff and the defendant. If public policy looks askance,
as it has been
held repeatedly to do, at the extension of qualified privilege to general
defamatory publications by newspapers, telecasts
and radio broadcasts, then
there would seem to me to be no logical reason why the same approach should not
apply to a general defamatory
publication in the form of a book. I think that
any reasonably well-read and well-informed members of the contemporary
Australian
community would think that McHugh J's observations about <i>`the low
quality and sensational nature of significant parts of the late nineteenth
century and twentieth century media' </i>would all too readily embrace books,
and in particular books of occasional political, social and moral content.
<P>

	(8)	The defendant submitted that publication at large of the subject book
equated to <i>"a public meeting on a topic of public concern, available to all,
but likely to be attended only by those with a special interest
in the topic;
such a meeting is normally regarded as an occasion of qualified
privilege"</i>.
<P>

	I do not accept that submission. <i>"A public meeting ...........available to
all"</i> is precisely that; and a person who uses it as an occasion for the
publication of defamatory untruths should not be encouraged to
expect, and is
in my opinion not entitled to expect, that he can so conduct himself with
impunity as of course.
<P>

	(9)	Doing my best to bring into a sensible balance all of the foregoing
matters, I have come to the conclusion that the defendant
has not established
on the probabilities the existence of a social or moral duty incumbent upon him
at the time of the publication
of the subject book, and apt to attract to that
occasion of publication the defence of common law qualified privilege. 
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Statutory Qualified Privilege</u></b>
<P>

19  	Once again it is convenient to begin by noting the terms of the
defendant's pleading. They are as follows:
<P>

"(ii)	<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">DEFAMATION ACT</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">SECTION 22</a></u>
<P>

(a)	the subject or subjects of the matter complained of were the matters of
public interest stated above;
<P>

(b)	the Defendant ........(relies) ........ upon that interest and apparent
interest;
<P>

(c)	the reasonable grounds for the defendant's relief that the recipients of
the matter complained of had an apparent interest were
that the matter
complained of related to the subjects referred to above and the Defendant
believed that those recipients were members
of that section of the community
that had a special interest in the public and parliamentary debate on the
issues particularised
herein under `Public Interest';
<P>

(d)	the reasonable grounds for the Defendant's belief that the recipient were
members of that section of the community referred
to in (c) above, were that
the Defendant prepared the matter complained of in the form of a book of
scholarly style and content for
those persons to read;
<P>

(e)	the Defendant's conduct was reasonable in the circumstances because ......
(he) .........believed what ..........(he).............published
to be true and
took care to form a belief in the accuracy and fairness of the information and
comment contained in the matter complained
of. The Defendant ..........(was)
..........satisfied as to the authenticity and accuracy of the sources of the
information available
when preparing the matter complained of. The Defendant
................(was)...........satisfied as ..........(to)......... the
fairness
of the language and the manner in which the matter complained of was
composed and presented. The Defendant ..........(was)...........
satisfied that
the months of research and meticulous enquiries made not only by
..........(himself)........ but by the Courts into
the accuracy of the
Plaintiff's testimony at various hearings was such that publication of the
matter complained of was reasonable."
<P>

20  	The particulars of <i>"Public Interest"</i> as noted previously
and at paragraph 13 herein are provided in connection with the defence of
statutory qualified privilege, as well
as in connection with the defence,
earlier considered, of qualified privilege at common law.

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council approved the view, expressed by the New
South Wales Court of Appeal in <b>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2
NSWLR 749</a>, that the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a> of the Act is<i> "to substitute
reasonableness in the circumstances for the duty or interest which the common
law principles of privilege require

added its own observation that the Act <i>"was clearly intended to widen the
scope of the common law defence of qualified privilege"</i> [  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20AC%20312D" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) AC, 312D</a>
and G ].
<P>

23  	In applying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a>, as thus construed, to the defendant's book, it
is necessary to define clearly what constitutes the <i>"subject"</i>, the
giving of <i>"information"</i> about which is said to attract the statutory
privilege. 
<P>

24  	In my opinion the <i>"subject"</i> of the defendant's book can
be defined as: "<i>whether justice, or injustice, was done to Messrs. Anderson,
Alister and Dunn in, and in connection with, the connected sequence of
curial
and judicial proceedings to which they were parties"</i>.<i> </i>
<P>

25  	It must next be asked, in the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22(1)(a)</a>, whether the
defendant has proved on the balance of probabilities that <i>"the
recipient"</i> had an interest, or an apparent interest, in having information
on that subject matter. The following points thereupon call for
consideration.
<P>

26  	<i>First</i>, the notion of <i>"the recipient" </i>cannot be
given any precise definition because the subject book was put, upon
publication, on general sale to the public. The defendant
gave, in that
connection, the following evidence which was not contradicted and which I
therefore accept:
<P>

"Q.	Do you remember, off hand, your sales figures on it - I know I have asked
you this before, but it was in excess of 3,000 in
paper back?
<P>

A.	No, it was only just over 3,000. If you are asking me my recollection, it
was in the very low thousand 3,000. That was the total
print run. By no means
were all of those sold, because I still have probably 200 at home and at one
stage I gave away a considerable
number to people I knew who were lecturers at
university law schools and they gave them to their students. I couldn't tell
you how
many, but in some hundreds. I think they came in boxes of 25 books; 20
hard books, which there are very few, and 25 paper book which
were heavy and I
remember delivering some number of the books to those people, which reinforced
my views about the prospects of the
sale of such a book." (trial transcript 237
(40) - (55)
<P>

27  	The effect of this evidence is, in my opinion, that the
recipients of the book comprised, at least:
<P>

(a)	persons who actually bought and read the book; and
<P>

(b)	persons who did not themselves buy the book, but were given it, in
whatsoever particular circumstances, to read and who then
read it.
<P>

28  	It is not possible further to quantify that total readership.
This aspect of the present case is not like, for example, the
corresponding
aspect of the case of <b>Austin</b>, previously cited. There, the publication
was in a major metropolitan daily newspaper, having a circulation, as noted by
the Privy
Council, in the order of 353,000 copies. Here, the probable reach of
the publication was much less extensive. Of course, that is
not to say that it
was in any sense insignificant. The distribution throughout the general
community of, as it would seem from the
evidence, in the order of 2,000 copies
of the subject book, was more than wide enough to do a great deal of real
damage to the reputation
of anyone who was imputed by the book to be a proven
liar and perjurer who had made a major contribution to an appalling miscarriage
of public justice.
<P>

29  	<i>Secondly</i>, it has to be decided whether the
<i>"recipient"</i>, thus understood, had <i>"an interest or an apparent
interest"</i> in receiving <i>"information"</i> on the <i>"subject"</i>, as
previously defined, of the defendant's book.
<P>

30  	In this connection, the advising of the Privy Council in
<b>Austin</b> establishes the following propositions:
<P>

"1.	<i>Information</i>, in this particular statutory context, embraces both
fact and opinion.
<P>

 2.	<i>Interest</i>, in that same context, embraces <i>"any matter of genuine
interest"</i> to the readership of the subject book; <i>"and there are as many
matters of opinion that will be of general interest to the readership
.........as there are facts upon which
such opinions are based"</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20AC%20313A" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) AC,
313A</a>
<P>

31  	The principles thus established entail, in my opinion, that the
defendant has plainly satisfied the requirements of paragraphs
(a) and (b) of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)</a> of the Act. 
<P>

32  	It remains for the defendant, if he is to succeed on the defence
of statutory qualified privilege, to satisfy on the probabilities
the
requirements of paragraph (c) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1).</a> Once again, it is useful to
begin by setting in place some basic propositions.
<P>

33  	<i>First</i>, paragraph (c) focuses on the defendant's conduct
in connection with the publication, not of the book as a whole, but of the
defamatory
imputation carried by the published material: "<i>The more serious
the imputation, the greater the obligation on the defendant to ensure that his
conduct in relation to it was reasonable"</i>: <b>Morgan v John Fairfax &amp;
Sons Ltd (No. 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 374</a> per Hunt AJA at 387E.
<P>

34  	<i>Secondly</i>, what conduct is <i>"reasonable in the
circumstances"</i> of a given case will depend upon the particular facts of
that case. It is, however, possible to define certain factors that are of
general application. It is convenient to do so by way of further reference to
the judgment of Hunt AJA in <b>Morgan</b>. His Honour says:
<P>

"The defendant must also establish: 
<P>

(a)	that, before publishing the matter complained of, he exercised reasonable
care to ensure that he got his conclusions right,
(where appropriate), by
making proper enquiries and checking on the accuracy of his sources;
<P>

(b)	that his conclusion (whether statements of fact or expressions of opinion)
followed logically, fairly and reasonably from the
information which he had
obtained;
<P>

(c)	that the manner and extent of the publication did not exceed what was
reasonably required in the circumstances; and
<P>

(d)	that each imputation intended to be conveyed was relevant to the subject
about which he is giving information to his readers."<i>: </i>see at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20388B%2fC" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23
NSWLR, 388B/C.</a>
<P>

35  	<i>Thirdly, </i>there being on the facts of the present case no
doubt at all that the defendant intended to convey the defamatory imputation in
question,
the defendant must satisfy the Court on the probabilities that he
believed in the truth of that imputation: <b>Morgan</b> per Hunt AJA at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20387F" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991)
23 NSWLR 387F.</a>
<P>

36  	As to the third matter in the foregoing sequence, I am satisfied
that the defendant did have in fact that belief. The defendant
himself gave
clear and positive evidence to that effect. I do not see that the evidence was
either wholly destroyed, or shaken in
its substance, by cross-examination. I
accept that part of the defendant's evidence. 
<P>

37  	As to the four matters (a)-(d) previously mentioned, I am of the
opinion that the factor (d) is clearly established on the
face of the published
material. Whether the other three factors, (a) - (c) have been established by
the defendant on the probabilities,
depends upon an analysis of the relevant
evidence given at trial.
<P>

38  	In his evidence in-chief, the defendant said that he had first
become interested in the case of the Ananda Marga Three in 1979.
He was working
at the time for the A.B.C. producing radio programmes. His attention was drawn
to the first of the two trials, which
was then current. The defendant did not
spend any great length of time at this first hearing; but he did drop in to it
from time
to time. The impression that it made on him, he explained as
follows:
<P>

"I was particularly struck, from the sections of the case that I attended, by
some aspects of it which seemed to me somewhat unusual
- illogical, is the best
single word perhaps. Among which I now remember as perhaps the only clear
example what always struck me
and still does as the bizarreness of somebody
driving a car with two people in it who, on his account, agreed to send off a
bomb
if they're stopped, when he has arranged for surveillance of what they are
doing, and it is at least reasonably likely that they're
going to be
stopped.
<P>

I remember walking back from one occasion when I was at that trial when
thinking about that event said, thinking of that, it was
extremely puzzling and
bizarre and anti-logical."
<P>

39  	When it came to his notice that the jury had not been able to
agree upon a verdict in the case of any one of the three accused
persons, and
that there was to be in consequence a second trial, the defendant made it his
business to attend parts of that trial
also. His best recollection was that he
had seen, in that connection, at least a part of the plaintiff's evidence as it
was being
given.
<P>

40  	The defendant said that he had remembered aspects of the two
trials over the following years until 1981 when he had conceived
the idea of
looking again at the trials as potential sources of material from which he
might fashion one or more radio programmes
of the kind which he was then
producing. The defendant did in fact obtain various materials connected with
the two trials; and did
in due course produce and broadcast two one-hour radio
programmes. There ensued some listener feed-back, the tenor of some of which
tended to strengthen the defendant's own growing conviction that there was
something amiss in the convictions of the Ananda Marga
Three. The defendant
described as follows what then ensued:
<P>

"By that stage, I can't pin it down precisely, but around that time, I had
become fairly firmly persuaded that the case was, in
fact, a serious
miscarriage of justice. When I say `by that stage', I mean after I had done all
the work and put those programmes
together. At some point around there, perhaps
up to a year or so after I made the programmes, again I can't tie that down
exactly,
I decided that I should write a book about the case."
<P>

41  	And so, the defendant set to work on the writing of the subject
book. The exercise took a long time, being done intermittently
and as
opportunities arose; and being necessarily interrupted from time to time by
developments concerning the cases of the three
convicted men, principally in
the form of the Hilton bombing inquest and of the subsequent inquiry conducted
by Wood J. The defendant
described as follows what he had been trying to
achieve as he progressed with the writing of the subject book:
<P>

"I wanted the book to be a documentation of all the major aspects of the case
so that people who were concerned about what I saw
as an important public
issue, an important question of public interest, those who were willing to
spend the effort to search out
the book, by whatever means, and willing to
spend the time and effort of writing (sic: but read `reading') a fairly
sizeable treatment,
would have something available to them so that they could
find out great and complex details about it which they have no chance of
getting from any other source."
<P>

42  	The defendant attended the whole of the Hilton bombing inquest.
After its conclusion he obtained a transcript and <i>"a large amount of
associated material"</i>, the precise details of which the defendant could not
recall except to say that it included witness statements of the various
witnesses
and some additional material such as police running sheets.
Thereafter the defendant continued work on the subject book. 
<P>

43  	In due course, the inquiry conducted by Wood J was formally
established. The defendant made contact with various of the professional
legal
representatives of Messrs. Anderson, Alister and Dunn; and was eventually
retained formally as part of the team of such representatives
acting on behalf
of the three petitioners before the inquiry. The defendant's work in that
connection occupied him full-time from
August 1984 to February 1985. The
defendant was closely involved in the inquiry. Part of that involvement
concerned the preparation
of the detailed submissions made to Wood J on behalf
of the three petitioners. At the conclusion of the inquiry the defendant was
in
possession of a very large amount of transcript and ancillary documentation
deriving from the work done in connection with the
enquiry.
<P>

44  	After the conclusion of the inquiry, the defendant continued to
write the subject book, working from time to time in what spare
time he had
from his other personal and professional preoccupations. After the publication
of Wood J's report, the defendant obtained
a copy of the report and studied it
closely. He found himself in agreement with parts of it and in disagreement
with other parts
of it.
<P>

45  	The defendant finished writing the subject book <i>"somewhere in
late 1985"</i>. He was not optimistic about finding a commercial publisher for
the work; and, ultimately, he published it himself but had it distributed
to
the retail trade by a commercial distributor.
<P>

46  	The defendant, having given the evidence which I have
summarised, described as follows his approach, over all, to the writing
of the
subject book:
<P>

The writing of the book was a quite vast effort, really. I tried throughout to
carefully cross check everything I wrote. I believe
I did. Indeed, I would say
I went through an exercise of some scupulousness in ensuring that I was, to the
best of my ability, accurately
representing the events I described and the
material I was reproducing.
<P>

The account of the inquiry in particular was a very difficult one, because it
was an exercise not only in compression, but finding
a workable narrative shape
to fit it all into. One of the difficulties with detailed analysis is that it
often stops dead the momentum
of the narrative and there is considerable
difficulty in finding an accommodation between those two. I don't know if I
succeeded,
but I am very conscious that one of the difficult aspects of the
task was to find some accommodation that developed a narrative and
also which
has an inter-relationship between things in a progress order and also to get
successfully into a detailed analysis of
things.
<P>

I was well conscious there were selections to be made. There were things I
decided not to include. There were a number of, for example,
arguments in
favour of the petitioners' case. I think a number of findings made in a general
case which would be in their interests
by Justice Wood which I regarded as,
let's say, second rank, less important, and probably fairly represented in
their nature by other
matters that I regarded as more important and some of
those second rank things are left out. In the nature of the inquiry, I thought
that was quite inevitable if any treatment of practical length was to be
devised.
<P>

The complaint in this case, the imputation complained of, that the plaintiff
framed members of the Ananda Marga by committing perjury,
is something I have
believed for a very long time - it is still my belief now. It certainly was
throughout the time of writing and
publishing the book. It became intensified
by some of the matters which surfaced at the inquiry.
<P>

I should say I do not claim now to be able to revisit, to recall, the whole
process mentally or physically that I went through in
researching the book and
writing it. At this distance, any attempt by me to do that is likely to be a
recreation of what I thought
I would have done rather than what I actually did.
I can't account now for the process by which I originally arrived at that
conclusion.
I think I was fairly firm in it, at least after the Hilton Inquest
- from then on.
<P>

My reasons for that belief are in the book and I don't know that sensibly I
could put them in any priority order and there is a
cumulative effect, in any
event, as between them."
<P>

47  	The plaintiff rounded out this summary of his approach to the
subject book by explaining that he had chosen the illustrations
which appear
throughout the subject book; and that he had done so having in mind, in
particular, what he saw as the importance of
recreating in the mind of a
reader, in so far as that was possible: <i>"....... the rather over-excited
atmosphere of the time, as I judge it in some respects ......"</i>.
<P>

48  	The defendant went on to explain that he had taken particular
care to give as full and as fair an account as he could of the
case against the
Ananda Marga Three, as well as the case in their favour. He said that his
approach had been that it was not possible
<i>"with credibility or honesty for
that matter, effectively (to) take apart a case without first acknowledging
what its strengths are,
what its high points are. I thought it was necessary to
reproduce in quite extensive form the precise terms of the evidence against
the
three men in relation to the Yagoona matter; and that is really the reason why
there are such extensive verbatim extracts from
the transcript of the second
trial, being the one which secured the convictions, throughout the chapters
which deal with the afternoon
of Thursday, 15 June, the question of crossing
Carillon Avenue and who got the bomb, the events out at Yagoona and the events
back
at Newtown with the press releases."</i>
<P>

49  	The defendant explained, finally in his evidence in-chief, that
there had been of necessity an element of compression in the
composition and
structure of the subject book; that it had been necessary on that account to
make particular judgments concerning
the inclusion or the exclusion of various
matters of detail; but that he had sought to keep, overall, a fair balance
having regard
to the over-riding objective of the subject book, which was to
bring to the public attention what he, the defendant, himself believed
genuinely then, and believes genuinely now, to have been a serious miscarriage
of public justice deriving in large part from the
perjury of the plaintiff.
<P>

50  	The defendant was extensively cross-examined. Two or three
different particular lines of cross-examination were followed by
the
cross-examiner; but, in one way or another, they all had to do with a constant
theme, namely, the propositions, put repeatedly
to the defendant in
cross-examination, that he had been, from the first, a partisan ally of the
Ananda Marga Three; and that this
partisanship had caused him to ignore
material available to him in connection with the writing of the subject book
and either casting
the Ananda Marga movement in an unflattering light; or
reflecting favourably, at least to some extent however limited, upon the
plaintiff.
<P>

51  	I have come to the conclusion that the defendant's evidence is,
to speak in general terms, reliable and truthful; and I accept
it. I do not
accept that the available evidence, considered fairly, demonstrates
partisanship on the part of the defendant of so
extreme a kind as led to his
deliberate suppression in the subject book of material, then available to him,
and capable if accepted
of contradicting the substance of the imputation which
is now in point.
<P>

52  	I have come to the conclusion that the defendant has established
on the probabilities each of the matters referred to in the
paragraphs (a), (b)
and (c), as set out in paragraph 35 of this judgment. It follows that, in my
opinion, the defendant has established
the defence of statutory qualified
privilege. Whether that defence has been successfully rebutted by proof of
malice in the defendant
is a separate question to which I shall return later in
this judgment.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Comment</u></b>
<P>

53  	Once again, I shall leave for later consideration in this
judgment the question of malice in the defendant.
<P>

54  	Malice apart, the defendant must establish on the probabilities
that the relevant imputation is:
<P>

(i)	a comment rather than a statement of fact;
<P>

(ii)	that it is a comment referable to what is described in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the Act as
<i>"proper material for comment"</i>;
<P>

(iii)	that the comment relates to a matter of public interest; and
<P>

(iv)	that the comment, at the time it was made, represented the opinion of the
defendant.
<P>

55  	In the present case, it seems to me to be clear that the
relevant imputation is carried by the subject book as a matter of
comment on
the part of the defendant. I think that the imputation represents, upon a fair
reading of the subject book, a fundamental
thesis or conclusion for which the
defendant argues upon the basis of the material that he canvasses in the
book.
<P>

56  	The statutory concept of <i>"proper material for comment"</i> is
the subject of definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30(1)</a> of the Act. Broadly speaking, material
will be regarded as <i>"proper material for comment"</i> if it fits within any
one of three nominated categories, namely:
<P>

(a)	a statement of fact; or
<P>

(b)	a protected report within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24</a> of the Act, or
<P>

(c)	material upon which, for some other reason, comment might be based for the
purposes of this particular defence.
<P>

57  	The defendant submits that the imputation now relevant is
comment made by him upon the substance of a number of proceedings,
reports of
which are protected reports within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24</a> of the Act. Schedule 2
to the Act specifies a number of different kinds of proceedings for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24.</a> Those specified categories of proceedings include:
<P>

"(5)  Proceedings in public of a court; 
<P>

(6)  Proceedings in public of an inquiry held under the legislation of any
country or held under the authority of the government
of any country."
<P>

58  	The defendant submits that the material upon which his
defamatory comment is based comprises the whole sequence of judicial
and
quasi-judicial proceedings to which reference is made early in this judgment;
that is to say, the committal proceedings against
Messrs. Anderson, Alister and
Dunn; their two subsequent trials and the appeal proceedings consequent upon
those trials; the inquest
into the bombing of the Hilton Hotel; and the inquiry
conducted by Wood J. The defendant submits that all of these proceedings fit
either of the two specified categories referred to above.
<P>

59  	In my opinion, these submissions of the defendant are correct.
The subject book seems to me to report fairly the substance
of each set of the
relevant proceedings; and by so doing to constitute within the subject book a
body of material correctly described
as <i>"proper material for comment"</i> in
the requisite statutory sense.
<P>

60  	There is uncontradicted evidence from the defendant that the
comment, at the time it was made, did indeed represent his honest
opinion. I
accept that evidence.
<P>

61  	I am satisfied as to the existence of the requisite element of
public interest. That there had been a serious miscarriage of
public justice
leading to the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of these innocent men; and
that a prime factor in the occurrence
of that miscarriage had been perjured
evidence by the plaintiff, given in order to cause that miscarriage; were, in
my opinion, clear
matters of public interest.
<P>

62  	I am of the opinion, therefore, that, subject to its rebuttal by
reason of malice in the defendant, this particular defence
has been
established.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Truth</u></b>
<P>

63  	By reason of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.15</a> of the Act, the defendant
cannot succeed on this defence unless he establishes on the probabilities that
the relevant imputation:
<P>

1.	is a matter of substantial truth; and
<P>

2.	<i>either</i> relates to a matter of public interest <i>or</i> is published
under qualified privilege.
<P>

64  	For reasons already explained, I am of the opinion that the
relevant imputation both relates to a matter of public interest,
and was
published under statutory qualified privilege. The only remaining issue is,
therefore, whether the defendant has established
on the probabilities that the
imputation is substantially true.
<P>

65  	In that connection, the appropriate starting point is, I think,
a realistic appreciation of the extreme gravity of the allegation
which is made
against the plaintiff by the relevant imputation. In such a context, it is very
much to the point that there be kept
carefully in mind the principles, a
classic definition of which is to be found in the judgment of Dixon J in
<b>Briginshaw v Briginshaw &amp; anor </b>[1938) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=60%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">60 CLR 336</a> at 361, 362. The
relevant passage reads as follows:
<P>

"Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that
the affirmative of an allegation is made out to
the reasonable satisfaction of
the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is
attained or established independently
of the nature and consequence of the fact
or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent
unlikelihood
of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the
consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations
which must
affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In
such matters `reasonable
satisfaction' should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony,
or indirect inferences. Everyone
must feel that, when, for instance, the issue
is on which of two dates an admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory
conclusion
may be reached on materials of a kind that would not satisfy any
sound and prudent judgment if the question was whether some act
had been done
involving grave moral delinquency."
<P>

66  	The succinct and helpful written submissions put in by the
defendant outline with complete clarity the factual bases for the
contention of
the defendant that the relevant imputation can be demonstrated, to the
requisite standard of proof, to be substantially
true. A paraphrase of the
defendant's outline will not do, I think, justice to what is being argued. I
have therefore adopted the
expedient of attaching to the present judgment a
photocopy of the relevant portions of the defendant's written submissions.
<P>

67  	It will be seen from what follows that, in coming to a
conclusion upon the issue of substantial truth, - (and in coming, later
herein,
to a conclusion concerning the related defence of contextual truth), - I rely
heavily upon the findings made by Wood J in
his Honour's report of May 1985,
being the report of the Inquiry, earlier herein referred to, held by his Honour
under s.475 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b> <b>(NSW)</b>. Volumes 1 and 2 of his
Honour's report are exhibit O in the present proceedings, having been so
received in evidence upon a tender
by the plaintiff. The contents of those two
volumes have, therefore, legitimate standing as evidence available for my
consideration
in connection with the present proceedings. I acknowledge, at
once, that it would be entirely inappropriate for me simply to transpose
into
the different context of the present proceedings, conclusions reached by Wood J
in connection with his Honour's Inquiry; and
I have been careful throughout not
to make any such simplistic and undiscriminating transposition. I have kept in
mind, throughout,
that the weight to be given for my present purposes to any of
the particular conclusions reached by Wood J must be considered in
the light of
any relevant evidence particular to the present proceedings.
<P>

68  	All of that said, I think, nevertheless, that it is proper to
give considerable weight to the conclusions reached by Wood J.
I say so for the
following reasons.
<P>

69  	<i>First</i>, it is apparent on the face of Exhibit O that Wood
J was able to enquire, with a breadth and in a depth wholly beyond the scope of
the evidence in the recent hearing in this Court, into the details and
complexities of the facts and circumstances out of which there
emerged the
committal proceedings, the two trials, and the Hilton bombing inquest, to all
of which I have previously made reference.

<P>

70  	<i>Secondly</i>, Wood J had the advantage, which I did not
enjoy, of top-level and independent legal professional representation of all
interested
parties who were heard by his Honour during the course of the
Inquiry. One has only to read the list of acknowledgments on page 453
of the
report, in order to see at a glance the breadth and the depth of the
independent legal professional assistance that was available
to his Honour. At
the recent hearing before this Court, by contrast, the plaintiff represented
himself, as did the defendant. The
defendant is, of course, a practising member
of the Bar. This gave him, vis a vis the plaintiff, obvious forensic
advantages. It
gave him, also, professional learning and experience that were,
if I may say so, of real assistance to the Court. The plaintiff,
on the other
hand, had to do the best he could with virtually no legal professional
assistance. As the trial transcript will show,
the Court had to tread
constantly the fine line between giving some assistance to the plaintiff in
order that he might be, as it
were, pointed in the right direction; and not
interfering in such a way as would raise in the mind of the defendant a
reasonable
apprehension that the Court was losing its necessary
impartiality.
<P>

71  	<i>Thirdly</i>, Wood J had the advantage of seeing the plaintiff
in the witness box. The plaintiff's experience on that occasion moved Wood J to
comment: <i>"There can be few if any witnesses who have been subjected to such
a prolonged and minute attack in the witness box"</i>. Of course, Wood J did
not see the defendant in the witness box, because the defendant actually
appeared as one of three counsel
representing Mr. Alister at the Inquiry. My
experience in the recent trial has been exactly the opposite. I had the
advantage of
hearing the defendant give evidence; and I had the further
advantage of seeing him tested, at least to some extent, by cross-examination.
The plaintiff did not, however, go into the witness box, although he did call
other lay evidence in support of his case. I am not
intending by what I now say
to criticise the plaintiff for not having gone into the witness box. All that I
am saying is that in
fact he did not go into the witness box ; and that the
necessary result is that I have not had anything like the opportunity that
was
available to Wood J for the making of a careful and thorough assessment of the
plaintiff's credit.
<P>

72  	<i>Fourthly,</i> the defendant, as I understand his position,
does not contend that Wood J misapprehended the evidence put before his Honour
at the
Inquiry. The defendant, as is clear from the subject book, takes issue
with various opinions expressed by Wood J; and with what the
defendant sees as
a failure of Wood J to make affirmative findings critical of the police and
intelligence services. But, at least
as to those conclusions of Wood J to which
I hereinafter refer, the defendant, as I understand his position, does not
contend that
such conclusions were not reasonably open to his Honour. 
<P>

73  	It is not possible to be quite so clear-cut about the
corresponding position of the plaintiff. As I have earlier noted, Exhibit
O was
tendered by the plaintiff; and parts of Exhibit O were referred to specifically
in the plaintiff's submissions. Of course,
the plaintiff would not accept the
correctness of the adverse findings about him which Wood J made; but that is
not to say that such
findings were not reasonably open to his Honour.
<P>

74  	The particular matters of fact and circumstance to which the
defendant points in his written submissions seem to me to reproduce
the
substance of submissions made to Wood J. 
<P>

75  	In dealing more particularly with the submissions now put by the
defendant, it is convenient to begin with a consideration
of the submissions
that are put under the heading: <i>"(iii) The Journey to Yagoona"</i>.
<P>

76  	The issue thus raised by the defendant in the present
proceedings seems to me to equate to an issue which was raised before
Wood J,
and which his Honour describes at pages 356 and 357 of his Honour's report in
the following way:
<P>

"The Journal
<P>

At the committal, Seary produced a bound notebook which he described as part of
a diary of his life, and loose papers which he said
were notes for entries to
be later included in the diary. Together these documents came to be known as
his journal.
<P>

The loose notes included a nine-page account of the events of 15th June, which
Seary said at the committal, and at the inquest,
was probably written on 17th
June, 1978. In this section were included conversations, implicating the
Petitioners in the Hilton bombing,
which were almost identical with the record
of interview given on 22nd June. The similarities between these documents is
shown in
the comparative table within appendix M. This was the record of
interview in which Seary first provided the evidence of Ananda Marga
implication in the bombing.
<P>

It was submitted by the Petitioners that only one inference was open. Seary, it
was said, composed an entirely fictional account
which he wrote into this
journal, and then learned by heart."
<P>

77  	There follows a detailed canvass by Wood J of the relevant
evidence given to his Honour's Inquiry. His Honour then sums up
as follows his
conclusions:
<P>

"It is difficult to know what to make of this journal. There are internal
inconsistencies if it was intended as a factual account,
and there are
indications suggestive of a building of the story in the way seen in the
records of interview. On the other hand, there
are some obstacles to the
Petitioners' submissions. For example, it was Detective Inspector Sheather who
decided to interview Seary
in relation to the Hilton bombing and who asked to
see Seary on 22nd June. No prior warning had been given which would have
allowed
a drafting and rehearsal of the allegations. Further, had Seary been
minded to frame the Petitioners from a rehearsed script, it
was unlikely he
would have produced the document at the committal, albeit reluctantly. It may
be that the writings were made after
the event given his predilection for
reducing his thoughts to paper. It may also be that this was done bona fide in
an attempt to
ensure accuracy in his disclosures.
<P>

No additional material was produced before the Inquiry to assist in the
resolution of this issue. I think it proper, however, to
regard the journal as
yet another curious facet in the Seary disclosures, particularly as he was
equivocal as to its true nature
and accuracy. When it was first produced, it
was claimed to be part of a continuous diary or record of his life. During the
Inquiry
it was described as a series of separate notes written as `a way of
expressing my thoughts'. The notes, he said, were neither complete,
nor
necessarily accurate records of the events recorded. He later said that there
was some purposeful inaccuracies because `there
was always a chance that
someone else would read it and I did not want to keep a perfectly accurate
record of what went on because
I did not want people to know'. He added that
`if it wasn't completely factual, I could deny it, if other people saw it'.
This may
have been true. Equally, in my view, it was an indication of a
willingness to invent an answer on the spur of the moment to deflect
an
embarrassing question."
<P>

78  	I do not see in the evidence available to me anything that would
lead logically to a conclusion differing from that expressed
by Wood J. Simply
to read the passages of the subject book to which the defendant refers in his
written outline, re-states rather
than resolves the issue.
<P>

79  	Turning next to that part of the defendant's outline under the
heading:<i> "(ii) The Reporting of the Plot to the Police"</i>, it will be seen
that the substance of what is there argued by the defendant turns in a very
real sense upon one's approach to Tape
9. The report of Wood J gives extended
and careful consideration to the authenticity of the tape recordings, including
Tape 9, of
debriefings by the police of the plaintiff. At pages 393 and 394 of
his Honour's report, and dealing with a subject described as
<i>"Debriefing
Anomalies"</i>, Wood J expresses the following conclusions:
<P>

"When Seary's evidence in relation to the petitioners is carefully examined, in
the light of the additional information and documents
available to the Inquiry,
cause for concern arises. There are inconsistencies apparent in the different
versions he recorded, in
his own writings, in debriefing sessions, in records
of interview, and in sworn evidence given in the various Courts and
administrative
Inquiries before which the matter has come. In some respects,
the material he has provided appears bizarre and improbable. In other
respects,
it appears not to accord with known facts. Explanations have been given which
are not always capable of ready acceptance,
or which are themselves
contradictory. The information Seary provided implicating the Petitioners has
tended to become more detailed.
Most noticeably, after several days of silence
the Petitioners' criminal activity was expanded beyond the Yagoona affair to
the Hilton
bombing. 
<P>

These matters cannot be considered in isolation from the independent evidence,
which for the reasons identified in chapter 10, gives
rise to a circumstantial
case against the Petitioners on which a jury properly instructed could have
convicted. The questions that
ultimately arise, however, are these:
<P>

Were the Petitioners and police carefully manoeuvred into position by Seary,
and the extrinsic facts skilfully manipulated by him,
so that a well forged
circumstantial case might appear? Alternatively, did the events transpire in
the general way that Seary described,
leaving him in a position where,
convinced of the petitioners' guilt yet fearful that the Crown case may not be
water-tight, he was
prepared to embellish and fill in the areas where he
suspected problems might arise?
<P>

Although I incline to the latter view, I am satisfied that the first
alternative cannot be excluded. ........................"
<P>

80  	Subject to one consideration, I do not see anything in the
evidence before this Court that would enable it to come to any more
precise a
conclusion than that reached by Wood J.
<P>

81  	The one additional consideration has to do with Tape 9 itself.
It was urged by the defendant that I should listen to it for
myself. I have
attempted to do so, using in the attempt two different tape recording machines.
In each case, the tape would not reproduce
any of the sounds encoded on it. As
best I cant judge, the reason for this malfunction has to do in some way with
the tape rather
than with the machine.
<P>

82  	There remain the submissions put under the heading: <i>  "(i)
The Plot Alleged by the plaintiff"</i>
<P>

83  	Once again, the anomalies and the inconsistencies to which the
submissions refer were the subject of submissions to, and of
extensive
consideration by, Wood J. So far as I can see from the relevant portions of his
Honour's report, Wood J accepted that these
anomalies and inconsistencies cast
shadows of doubt over the plaintiff's version of relevant events; but stopped
short of anything
in the nature of a positive finding that the plaintiff had
given perjured evidence in connection with those events.
<P>

84  	Once again, I am unable to see in the evidence before this Court
anything that compels, logically, any different conclusion.

<P>

85  	Before concluding what I have to say about this particular
defence, I wish to draw attention to some of the final conclusions
expressed by
Wood J in connection with the credit and the reliability of the present
plaintiff.
<P>

86  	Speaking of the plaintiff's general reliability, his Honour
expressed this final view:
<P>

"I am satisfied that the evidence concerning Seary's background and his
everyday dealings, and the expert evidence, showed him to
be a person of
considerable intelligence and imagination, who craved recognition and status,
and who was willing to exaggerate, bend
the truth, and lie in appropriate
circumstances. I am not satisfied that he was proved to be a mentally disturbed
and committed liar
or fantasiser, or to be incapable of giving truthful
evidence. I am, however, satisfied that a very serious question mark exists
in
relation to his general reliability, and that if he was minded to fabricate a
case against the Petitioners, he could have done
so with considerable
persuasion."
<P>

87  	Wood J then turned more particularly to the assessment of the
evidence given by the plaintiff in connection with the Yagoona
incident. As to
that, Wood J expressed these conclusions:
<P>

"I am satified that significant inconsistencies and anomalies were identified
in the evidence, debriefings and writings of Seary,
concerning the Yagoona
affair. I am further satisfied that there is a real possibility of his evidence
in relation to this matter
being false. This may have occurred either in
pursuance of a contrived plan on his part, to entrap and frame the Petitioners
for
 crimes of which they were innocent, or out of a misguided desire on his
part to strengthen the Crown case against the Petitioners
in respect of crimes
of which they were guilty. Each is available as a rational inference."
<P>

88  	Relevantly for present purposes, Wood J expressed as follows,
and in the concluding section of his Honour's report, what his
Honour described
as his: <i>"Overall Conclusion"</i>:
<P>

"I am satisfied that an inference exists that Seary manipulated the Petitioners
(and the police), and carefully caused the events
to be so ordered as to
present an apparently strong case against them. I form this conclusion, having
regard to my assessment of
his general reliability and his evidence concerning
the Yagoona affair, notwithstanding the strength of the independent evidence.
While I am unable to say that this is the correct inference to be drawn, it is
sufficient for my inquiry to state that it is a rational
inference that cannot
be excluded."
<P>

89  	The views expressed in the three extracts which I have just
quoted, express precisely the conclusions that I myself have reached
upon the
much more contained material placed before me in the present proceedings. There
is every reason to suspect that the plaintiff
did what is imputed to him by the
relevant imputation upon which he now sues. But that suspicion, entirely
reasonable as I think
it to be on the basis of the available material, falls
short, and a long way short, of that degree of persuasion which I would need
to
feel before I was prepared to make an affirmative public finding that the
assertions in the relevant imputation are in fact substantially
true. So that
there will be no misunderstanding upon the point, I wish to emphasise in the
plainest terms that what I have just said
does not in any way imply a view on
my part that there is room for an affirmative finding that the relevant
imputation is substantially
untrue. I say no more than that I am not satisfied
to the requisite standard that the defendant has established this particular
essential
element of his defence of truth. It follows necessarily that, in my
opinion, that defence has not been made good by the defendant.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Contextual Truth</u></b>
<P>

90  	The defendant has pleaded nine contextual imputations; pleading,
also, that as to each such contextual imputation:
<P>

1.	The imputation is a matter of substantial truth; and
<P>

2.	Related to a matter of public interest; or, in the alternative, was
published under qualified privilege; and
<P>

3.	That by reason of the substantial truth of the contextual implication,
publication of the plaintiff's imputation (b) did not
further injure the
reputation of the plaintiff.
<P>

91  	The nine contextual implications which are thus pleaded by the
defendant are as follows:
<P>

"(i)	The plaintiff had so conducted himself as reasonably to be suspected by
lawyers acting for Tim Anderson, Paul Alister and Ross
Dunn of placing the bomb
at the Hilton Hotel.
<P>

(ii)	The plaintiff was a perjurer;
<P>

(iii)	The plaintiff was a liar;
<P>

(iv)	The plaintiff was a fantasist:
<P>

(v)	The plaintiff was a thief;
<P>

(vi)	The plaintiff knowingly received the proceeds of drug thefts from
pharmacies;
<P>

(vii)	The plaintiff was a drug addict;
<P>

(viii)	The plaintiff was knowingly concerned in acts of supply of illegal
drugs, including heroin, LSD, cocaine and indian hemp;
<P>

(ix)	The plaintiff attempted to procure the bombing of the Homebush
Abbatoir."
<P>

92  	Once again, it is for the defendant to establish, according to
the requisite legal standard as previously herein discussed,
those matters
which must be established in order to make good his defence of contextual
truth. I would say at once that, in my opinion,
any contextual imputation of
the above kinds would relate, in the circumstances of the present particular
case, to a matter of public
interest in the sense discussed and accepted more
than once in what has previously been written herein. 
<P>

93  	<b>As to contextual imputation (i):</b> Wood J, in a section of
his Honour's report entitled: <i>"Seary as the Hilton Bomber?"</i> examines
exhaustively this suggestion. His Honour notes that no proposition that he was
the Hilton bomber was put fairly and squarely
to the plaintiff in accordance
with the rule of practice established by the decision in <b>Browne v Dunn</b>.
His Honour notes that, instead, the plaintiff had been cross-examined about
particular circumstances suggestive of there being reason
to think that he,
himself, had been the Hilton bomber.
<P>

94  	After his Honour's exhaustive canvass of the topic, Wood J
expresses the following conclusion:
<P>

"I am quite unpersuaded on the evidence before me, that there is a prima facie
circumstantial case implicating Seary and the Hilton
bombing. No direct
evidence of his involvement was led, and there was nothing to suggest that
additional material was available to
the police which called for further
inquiry in this regard. The only conclusion reasonably open is that the
identity of the Hilton
bomber or bombers remains at large."
<P>

95  	The evidence before this Court certainly does not improve, in my
opinion, upon the position as thus described.
<P>

96  	I am not satisfied to the requisite legal standard that the
defendant has established the substantial truth of this particular
contextual
imputation.
<P>

97  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (ii):</b>	The written submissions
of the defendant further particularise the alleged perjury. It is said to lie
in the following particular
pieces of the plaintiff's evidence on prior
occasions:
<P>

(a)	Anderson asked him the previous week-end to find Cameron's address.
<P>

(b)	He looked up the address overnight at home in an old phone book.
<P>

(c)	Anderson and Alister synchronised watches.
<P>

(d)	He was unaware of the conversation on Tape 9 being recorded.
<P>

(e)	He had not learned by heart the account of the confession by Alister and
Dunn to the Hilton bombing which he gave to the police.
<P>

(f)	Alister and Dunn had confessed on the journey to Yagoona to having done the
Hilton bombing.
<P>

(g)	He did not know to which papers the press releases were directed.
<P>

(h)	Alister and Dunn resolved on the journey to Yagoona to detonate the bomb if
apprehended.
<P>

(j)	He had not, while a member of Hare Krishna, suggested to other members that
they should bomb the Homebush Abbatoir.
<P>

98  	As to each of the matters thus particularised, with the
exception of that in particular (j), I would not be prepared to make
an
affirmative finding that the plaintiff had committed perjury in the precise
respects propounded by the defendant. In broad terms,
I would reach such a
conclusion by a process of reasoning similar to that which I have canvassed at
length in the immediately preceding
section of this judgment.
<P>

99  	The matter particularised (j) is, in my view, in a different
category. Wood J examined exhaustively this particular matter.
His Honour came
to the conclusion that he <i>"must prefer the evidence of the other witnesses
who gave a consistent account of Seary's activities that was totally contrary
to
his own evidence"</i>. Upon that basis, and for reasons developed in detail
at pages 258-270 of his Honour's report, Wood J reached the conclusion that:
<i>"It is clear that he lied in relation to this matter"</i>.
<P>

100  	There is nothing in the remainder of the evidence before me
that causes me to differ from that conclusion. Upon this aspect
of affairs, I
would be prepared to make an affirmative finding that the plaintiff gave false
evidence on oath to Wood J.
<P>

101  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (iii):</b>	I am satisfied that
this has been established, if by nothing else, by reason of the conclusion to
which I have come in respect of
contextual imputation (ii).
<P>

102  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (iv):</b>	In my opinion, this
imputation, also, has been established. The material in Exhibit O contains a
wealth of evidence supportive of
this contextual imputation. It is to be borne
in mind, of course, that to say of a person that it is substantially true to
describe
him as <i>"a fantasist"</i>, does not permit, without more, of the
drawing of a rational inference that he did what is alleged against him in the
imputation
(b) upon which the present proceedings are based. 
<P>

103  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (v):	</b>The plaintiff has never
denied, as I understand the available evidence, that he stole a motor vehicle
for use in connection with the
Yagoona affair. That alone would establish the
substantial truth of this contextual imputation.
<P>

104  	<b>As to Contextual Imputations (vi), (vii) and (viii):</b>
These are related contextual imputations in that they all concern some aspect
or other of the plaintiff's history, or suggested history,
of drug abuse. 
<P>

105  	These matters, too, were ventilated at the Inquiry conducted by
Wood J. Once again, the allegations were the subject of a
careful and
exhaustive review by his Honour who concluded:
<P>

"I am not satisfied that he could fairly be described ever to have been a
heroin addict. It is clear that he was a drug abuser,
but I think that his
involvement in this field has been exaggerated by him in his dealings with
others. 
<P>

I take the view that by the time of his recruitment the police were entitled to
regard him as a person who had severed his association
with narcotics. I am
convinced that any continued use of drugs during the period March to July 1978
would have been detected by the
police and by the rehabilitation experts with
whom he was in close contact at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre. In the result I
am unable
to conclude that his early history of drug abuse should be held
against him. If anything it indicated some strength of character
in his
successful separation from the drug scene."
<P>

106  	I see nothing in the other material before me that would
entail, logically, any different conclusion. I am not satisfied that
these
contextual imputations have been shown by the defendant to be substantially
true.
<P>

107  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (ix):</b>	Once again, this
matter is one that attracted a great deal of attention at the Inquiry conducted
by Wood J. Once again, I see nothing
in the evidence before me to indicate,
logically, any different conclusion from that reached by Wood J and as recorded
in the relevant
portions of Exhibit O, and as follows:
<P>

"I am accordingly satisfied that at some time during 1972, the possibility of
damaging the Homebush Abattoirs by means of explosives
was discussed between
persons who were either members or associates of the Hari Krishna movement in
Sydney. Whether it was Seary
who initiated the discussion or someone else, I am
unable to say. I am, however, satisfied that he was involved in the
discussions,
and that he drove at least three persons out to the Abattoirs in
order to show them where the explosives might be placed. It is equally
clear
that the proposal was rejected as totally unacceptable to responsible members
of the movement.
<P>

Whether the discussions were seriously entertained by those involved, or were
simply the products of macabre jest, or wild talk
among young men attracted to
an alternative society, is not apparent. That in discussion, Seary fanned the
embers of a more radical
involvement of the movement in Sydney however cannot
be gainsaid."
<P>

108  	I have found that the contextual imputations (ii) in part,
(iii), (iv), (v) and (ix) are substantially true. The question
has then to be
considered whether the combined effect of those substantially true contextual
imputations is such that their effect
upon the plaintiff's reputation is not
further injured by the imputation (b) on which the plaintiff now sues.
<P>

109  	There is no way in which this question can be answered with
scientific exactness or according to some scientific method. What
is involved
is a question of degree; and the striking of a comparative balance that strives
to reflect the probabilities in the real
world.
<P>

110  	It scarcely needs to be said that the contextual imputations,
the substantial truth of which I am satisfied to have been established,
would
naturally damage the plaintiff's reputation, and damage it significantly, in
the eyes of right-thinking members of the community.
But, for my own part, I
have not been persuaded that such damage to the plaintiff's reputation would,
as it were, simply outweigh
or otherwise neutralise the effect of the
imputation (b) upon which the plaintiff now sues. The notion that a person
would deliberately
contrive to have innocent people convicted of very serious
criminal offences, and would so contrive by the giving of extensive, and
extensively calculated, perjured evidence, strikes me as a notion that
right-thinking and reasonable members of the community would
regard with an
abhorrence greater, at least to some extent, than the abhorrence with which
they would regard a person of whom the
relevant contextual imputations were
substantially true.
<P>

111  	In my opinion, therefore, the defendant has not established on
the probabilities the defence of contextual truth.
<P>

<b><u>Malice</u></b>
<P>

112  	In finding, as I have hitherto done, that the defendant has
established the defences of statutory qualified privilege and
of comment, I
have expressly reserved in each case the question of malice. If the plaintiff
is able to establish malice in the defendant
in connection with the publication
of the subject book, carrying as it does the imputation (b) upon which, in
particular, the plaintiff
sues, then those defences would be defeated. 
<P>

113  	It is usual, in the language of the law, to equate malice with
improper motive. To put the point in that way is, however,
simply to raise the
question of how improper motive itself is to be defined relevantly to the law
of defamation. The learned authors
of <b>Tobin and Sexton: Australian
Defamation Law and Practice</b> propound, on the basis of the relevant
authorities, seven particular instances of malice in the sense now relevant.
They are:
<P>

"(a)	Knowledge of the falsity of the defamatory material or absence of belief
in its truth;
<P>

(b)	Recklessness as to whether the matter complained of was true or false;
<P>

(c)	Failure to inquire as to the truth of the defamatory material;
<P>

(d)	Introduction of material irrelevant to the occasion of qualified
privilege;
<P>

(e)	Manner and extent of publication, including the language in the matter
complained of;
<P>

(f)	Publication of other defamatory material published by the defendant
concerning the plaintiff;
<P>

(g)	Conduct of the litigation by the defendant, including the conduct of the
trial."
<P>

114  	In my opinion, none of the matters referred to above as (a),
(b), (c), (d) and (f) could be found reasonably on the evidence
to hand.
<P>

115  	As to the matter (g), I do not think that a fair view overall
of the course of the recent trial could justify a finding in
the plaintiff's
favour on this particular type of malice. As <b>Tobin and Sexton<i>
</i></b>point out: <i>"</i>An inference of malice drawn from the conduct of the
litigation by the conduct of the trial by the particular defendant is<i>: "an
inference that the courts are likely to be wary of drawing from the conduct by
the defendant, normally through his legal representatives,
of the litigation,
as any other approach might well inhibit a defendant in his pleading of
defences to which he was otherwise entitled"</i>.
<P>

116  	As to the matter (e), it is, I think, fair to say that the
plaintiff, in his submissions on the issue of malice, looked principally
to
this type of conduct. 
<P>

117  	Conduct of this kind needs to be assessed with some care. As
was said by Jordan CJ in <b>Godfrey v Henderson </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1944/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] NSWStRp 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2044%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 44 SR (NSW) 447</a>, at
454:
<P>

"It is of the utmost importance in the case of statements made on occasion of
qualified privilege, that the privilege which the
law casts around such
statements should not be nullified by a readiness to treat as evidence of
express malice destroying the privilege
anything which does not definitely, and
as a matter of common sense, point to the actual existence of some express
malice which was
really operative in the making of the statement; and
substantial evidence is required, not surmise or a mere scintilla."
<P>

118  	There can be, in my view, no denying that the terms of the
subject book are very strong. The book is polemical in tone. It
argues with
clarity, directness, and sometimes with an evident passion, for a point of view
in which it is clear the defendant firmly
believed at the time he wrote the
book; and, indeed, in which he still believes as firmly. The book is rightly
seen by the plaintiff
as scathing in its treatment of him so far as concerns
his conduct in connection with every stage of the proceedings involving Messrs.
Alister, Dunn and Anderson. Those considerations, however, cannot be conclusive
on the question of actual malice. What is to be looked
for in that particular
connection is the true motive of the defendant in writing the subject book,
carrying as it does the defamatory
imputation (b).
<P>

119  	I am comfortably satisfied that it could not be fairly found on
the available evidence that the defendant, in writing the
subject book, was
actuated by express malice, i.e. some express and improper purpose, concerning
the plaintiff. I think that the
reasonable inference to draw from the available
evidence is, overwhelmingly, that the defendant was utterly convinced that a
grievous
miscarriage of justice had occurred in the cases of Messrs. Alister,
Dunn and Anderson; that the fact of the miscarriage, its particular
circumstances, and its implications for the administration of public justice,
all required that there be something done to bring
all of those matters to the
public attention; and that he was particularly well placed to provide that
public information.
<P>

120  	That the subject book is combative in tone and uncompromisingly
pungent in its style, does not establish improper motive in
the author. There
is, so far as I can see, nothing else in the available evidence which, when
brought properly to account, would
add the element or elements necessary to
constitute actual malice.
<P>

121  	I conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff has not made good his
case on the issue of malice.
<P>

<b><u>Damages</u></b>
<P>

122  	Because I have upheld two in particular of the defences as
pleaded, there will be, in the ultimate event, judgment for the
defendant
against the plaintiff. It is a nice question whether, in those circumstances
and in this particular kind of case, I ought
to say anything at all about the
views that I would have been inclined to take on the question of damages had
that question become
a live one for me. I think it would be appropriate to
follow the comparable practice in personal injuries cases, and say something,
however brief, on the question of damages.
<P>

123  	I do not think that it is necessary in that connection to enter
upon a wide-ranging discussion of relevant principle. In my
opinion, the
plaintiff's case does not establish quantifiable damage in the sense of
quantifiable loss actually sustained. The plaintiff
did attempt to introduce
some evidence which seemed to me to be aimed at the proposition that the
effects upon him of the defamatory
imputation had been such as to deprive him
of income which he otherwise would and could have earned in an amount that was
fairly
precisely quantifiable. I do not think that the evidence goes far enough
to establish such a case. 
<P>

124  	As I have earlier remarked, the plaintiff himself did not give
evidence. He did call, however, evidence from two witnesses
on the issue of
damage to his reputation; and as to the effect, more generally, upon him of the
defamatory imputations. I see no
reason not to accept the substance of that
evidence.
<P>

125  	I would have thought it proper to approach the question of
damages upon the basis that the defamation of the plaintiff was
a serious one,
both in its particular terms, and in terms of the circulation given to it. I
would have thought it entirely reasonable
to approach the matter upon the basis
that the publication had caused real hurt to the plaintiff and real damage to
his reputation.
But I would have thought it reasonable, also, to take sensible
account of the practical effects of the way in which the plaintiff's
reputation
had been canvassed in public before the publication of the subject book and of
the particular defamatory imputation carried
by it.
<P>

126  	Taken for all in all, I would have thought that in this
particular case an award in the order of $20,000 would have been a
just
reflection of the harm done by the particular defamatory imputation.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusion and Orders</u></b>
<P>

127  	For the whole of the foregoing reasons, there will be judgment
for the defendant against the plaintiff.
<P>

128  	I will hear the parties on the question of costs.
<P>

129  	The exhibits will remain in Court for a period of 28 days from
today. If within that period there is an appeal against any
part of this
judgment, then the exhibits will remain in Court pending further order;
otherwise the exhibits may then be handed out
to the party respectively
entitled to them.

<b>SULLY J</b>
<P>

<b>28 September 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>13617/91 - Richard SEARY  v  Tom MOLOMBY</u></b>
<P>

	<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	In these proceedings Mr. Richard Seary, ["the
plaintiff"], sues to recover damages for libel. The matter of which the
plaintiff complains
is the entirety of a book entitled <i>"Spies Bombs and the
Path of Bliss"</i>. The book, ["the subject book"], was published in 1986, its
author being Mr. Tom Molomby, ["the defendant"], whom the plaintiff sued
originally as one of two defendants, the other defendant being the author of a
Foreword to the subject book. The plaintiff originally
sued upon two alleged
defamatory imputations, which were pleaded in the following terms:
<P>

"(a)	The Plaintiff is a murderer.
<P>

 (b)	The Plaintiff framed members of the Ananda Marga by committing
perjury."
<P>

2  	On 23 August last the Court, in a reserved judgment, dealt with
certain questions that had been separately tried following upon
the making of
an order in that behalf and pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p51" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51.</a> The effect of that
judgment was that the plaintiff's case against the author of the Foreword
failed; as did the plaintiff's case
against both defendants in so far as it
relied upon the imputation (a) as pleaded. The Court held, however, that the
imputation (b)
as pleaded was carried in fact by the contents of the subject
book; and was, further, defamatory of the plaintiff.
<P>

3  	Following the delivery of its reserved judgment, the Court heard
the balance of the plaintiff's case against the defendant.
That entailed, so
far as the plaintiff was concerned, a consideration of the issue of damages;
and of the issue of malice as a factor
defeating the various defences pleaded
by the defendant. The continued hearing entailed, so far as the defendant was
concerned, a
consideration of the defences of: qualified privilege at Common
Law; statutory qualified privilege pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a> (NSW)</b>, ["the Act"]; comment; justification; and contextual truth.
<P>

4  	This present judgment will deal first with the defences,
considering them in the order in which they were presented in the closing
submissions of the defendant; and will then consider malice and damages.
<P>

5  	Before embarking upon the consideration of any of those
particular issues, it is necessary to describe the general background
to them.
This can be done initially by reproducing paragraph 34 of the judgment
delivered on 23 August:
<P>

"Then in February 1978, despite an extensive security operation, a bomb
exploded in a garbage bin outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney
where various
Commonwealth heads of Government, including the Indian Prime Minister, Morarji
Desai, were gathered.  Three people
were killed and several seriously injured.
Almost immediately, Ananda Marga was blamed.  The Indian Prime Minister himself
accused
it, though conceding that he had no evidence.  An enormous
investigation was begun.
<P>

Into this unstable and volatile situation came a figure from the shadows, a
young man named Richard Seary, a former drug addict,
a drifter and dreamer with
a shifting sense of reality.  Within weeks of the Hilton bombing, he had joined
Ananda Marga as a police
informer; his mission was to find out if they had
anything to do with the Hilton bombing.
<P>

Time went by, and though Seary reported regularly, he had nothing about the
Hilton bombing.  But after some three and a half months
he contacted the police
late one afternoon, and told them that there was to be a bombing that night.
He himself was to drive the
car for the expedition.  Acting on Seary's
information, the police followed the car and pulled it over.  There was a bomb
in the
back seat.  Seary said that the others had brought it; they said that,
unknown to them, he had brought it.  Some days later Seary
added to his account
of events that night the allegation that during the journey the others had
confessed to having done the Hilton
 bombing.
<P>

That is the case at the centre of this book.  To what extent its circumstances
were the creation of the devious mind of Richard
Seary is the essential
judgment which the reader will have to make."
<P>

6  	The so-described <i>"case at the centre of"</i> the subject book
gave rise to a connected sequence of legal proceedings. Three young men, named
Anderson, Alister and Dunn, were
charged with conspiracy to murder, and two of
them were charged with attempted murder, in connection with the projected
bombing which
the plaintiff reported to the police. This bombing was to be
carried out, according to the plaintiff's report of it to the police,
at
Yagoona, an outer Sydney suburb. The three men were committed for trial upon
those charges. They were tried, subsequently and
upon indictment, on two
occasions. At their first trial, the jury could not agree upon any verdict. At
the second trial, all three
men were found guilty, and were sentenced thereupon
to substantial terms of imprisonment. The convictions and sentences were
appealed
unsuccessfully, both to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal
and to the High Court of Australia.
<P>

7  	Later, and as a consequence of sustained public and political
agitation, a judicial inquiry was established and was conducted
by Wood J of
this Court (as his Honour then was). The report of that inquiry found that
reasonable doubt existed as to the soundness
of all of the convictions; and
thereupon the three men, - (<i>"the Ananda Marga three",</i> as they have come
to be described frequently), - were released after having spent some years in
prison.
<P>

8  	Between the dismissal by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the
appeals brought to that Court, and the further appeals to the High
Court, a
coronial inquest was held into the deaths resulting from the Hilton Hotel
bombing. That inquest was terminated by the Coroner,
and as by law required,
upon the finding by the Coroner of a <i>prima facie</i> case of murder against
Messrs. Alister and Dunn.
<P>

9  	The plaintiff was a crucial prosecution witness in the committal
and in the two subsequent trials; and was an equally important
witness both at
the coronial inquest and at the judicial inquiry conducted by Wood J. 
<P>

10  	This standing of the plaintiff made him a figure of tremendous
forensic controversy. Those who appeared professionally at various
times for
the three accused men sought, as they had, of course, to do, to discredit the
plaintiff. He was attacked as a fantasist
at  best; a cold-blooded liar and
perjurer at worst. Any opinion concerning the probity of the prosecutions of
the three accused
men became, - and as the present hearing demonstrates,
continues to be, - inextricably interwoven with opinion about the probity
of
the evidence given by the plaintiff in the five sets of proceedings earlier
described.
<P>

11  	The subject book, whatever else is to be said fairly about its
contents, is a paradigm of that interweaving.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Qualified Privilege at Common Law</u></b>
<P>

12  	It is convenient to begin by noting the terms in which this
defence was pleaded and particularised by the defendant:
<P>

"(i)	<u>COMMON LAW</u> 
<P>

	the Defendant published the matter complained of pursuant to the social or
moral duty of do <i>(sic)</i> so and specifically, to inform that section of
the community that had a special interest in the public and parliamentary
debate on
the issued particularised herein under `Public Interest'. The
recipients of the matter complained of had a special interest in receiving
the
matter complained of because they were members of the public and because the
matter complained of related to the matters of public
interest stated above,
and because of the extreme seriousness of the problems relating to the
administration of justice, which affected
a substantial section of the
Australian community."
<P>

13  	The particulars of `Public Interest' referred to in that
pleading are stated as follows:
<P>

"(i)	the conduct of the Plaintiff as a spy and/or double agent to expose
criminal conduct;
<P>

(ii)	the conduct of the New South Wales judicial system;
<P>

(iii)	the circumstances in which three members of Ananda Marga namely Dunn,
Anderson, and Alister, came to be wrongfully arrested
for and accused of crimes
as a result of the wrongful or perjured testimony of the Plaintiff;
<P>

(iv)	investigation of serious crime; and
<P>

these matters were all inherently matters of public interest."
<P>

14  	It is necessary to keep in mind when considering the defence
thus pleaded and particularised two propositions, namely:
<P>

(1)	that the occasion said to have been one of qualified privilege was the
occasion of the publication in 1986 of the subject book.
(The fact of its
having been published by the defendant, although denied on the pleadings, was
in fact not disputed at the hearing.)
<P>

(2)	that the incidents of that occasion which are said to attract the relevant
privilege are the existence of a duty in the defendant
to publish the subject
book, and a corresponding interest in recipients of the book to have published
to them the contents of the
subject book, and the defamatory imputation now
relevant and conveyed by the subject book.
<P>

15  	The relevant principles of law which have then to be applied to
the defence as thus understood are not easy of particular and
practical
application in the present case; but they are at least reasonably well-settled
in theory. They can be summarised conveniently
by reference to the relevant
portions of the judgment of McHugh J in <b>Stephens v West Australian
Newspapers Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20182%20CLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 182 CLR 211</a> at 260-264:
<P>

"At Common Law, it is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter that
the matter was published in good faith on an occasion
of qualified privilege.
Statements `fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private
duty, whether legal or moral,
or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters
where his interest is concerned' are privileged even though they contain untrue
defamatory statements. However, the defence of qualified privilege is generally
not available where defamatory matter is published
in a newspaper. At common
law, the defence is not open unless the recipient of the publication possessed
an interest in receiving
or was under a duty to receive the communication that
corresponded with the interest or duty of the person making the publication.
.........................................................................................................................................................................................................
<P>

Reciprocity of interest or duty is essential to a claim of qualified privilege
at common law. The need for reciprocity usually defeats
a claim of qualified
privilege where the publication has been made to the general public. Only in
exceptional cases does a person
have an interest or duty to publish defamatory
matter to the world at large. Both in Australia and elsewhere, common law
courts have
repeatedly held that a person has no legitimate interest or duty to
publish defamatory matter to the general public if no more is
established than
that the subject matter of the publication is one in which the public is
interested. In <b>Howe &amp; McColough v Lees</b>, Higgins J said that the word
`interest' was not used in any technical sense. However, his Honour said that
the person must not be
`interested in it as a matter of gossip or curiosity,
but as a matter of substance apart from its mere quality as news'. In the same
case, O'Connor J said that the interest must be `of so tangible a nature that
for the common convenience and welfare of society it
is expedient to protect
it'.
<P>

As the decided cases show, however, circumstances may exist where the interest
of the general public in a particular subject is
such that a defence of
qualified privilege is available even though the communication is made to the
general public by means of a
newspaper or other medium of general circulation.
If a subject is one of public interest, members of the public have the
requisite
interest in receiving information on that subject from persons who
have a corresponding interest or duty to communicate that information
to the
general public.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
<P>

In determining whether a person has a legal, social or moral interest or duty
to publish to the world at large, the extent of the
publication and the
proportion of readers who have a legitimate interest in receiving the
communication are relevant factors to be
weighed. It has long been established,
however, that qualified privilege is not lost simply because the communication
is read, seen
or heard by persons having  no legitimate interest in receiving
the communication. If publication in a newspaper or by radio or television
is
the only reasonable mode of communicating with the public, qualified privilege
will not be lost because it is read, seen or heard
by persons who have no
legitimate interest in receiving the communication.
<P>

Although, as the foregoing account of the case law demonstrates, the common law
has upheld defences of qualified privilege for publications
to the world at
large, common law courts have taken a restricted view of the occasions when a
person has an interest or duty to publish
material to the general public.
Protection of reputation has generally been preferred to the right of the
public to know. It is not
surprising that successive generations of common law
judges have been loath to extend the categories of qualified privilege to
protect
publication in the general media. Although the tort of defamation law
became established at an early stage in the history of common
law, the defence
of qualified privilege, as we know it, was not recognised until the first part
of the last century. New legal doctrines
take time to win general acceptance in
the legal profession, and the low quality and sensational nature of significant
parts of the
late nineteenth century and twentieth century media have not been
conducive to the extension of a defence that protects the publication
of untrue
defamatory material.  However, as Cockburn CJ is reported to have said `those
who administer [the law of qualified privilege]
must adapt to the varying
conditions of society'."
<P>

16  	When, as in the present case, the defaming publisher claims the
protection derived from a social or moral duty to publish,
it is important to
be clear about the nature and extent of such duty which the law will accept as
attracting the relevant privilege.
A useful analysis of both the relevant law
and the difficulties of its application is contained in the following passage
from the
judgment of Scrutton LJ in <b>Watt v Longsdon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281930%29%201%20KB%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1930) 1 KB 130</a> at
143-144:
<P>

"The question whether the occasion was privileged is for the judge, and so far
as `duty' is concerned, the question is: Was there
a duty, legal, moral or
social to communicate? As to legal duty, the judge should have no difficulty ;
the judge should know the
law; but as to moral or social duties of imperfect
obligation, the task is far more troublesome. The judge has no evidence as to
the view the community takes of moral or social duties. All the help the Court
of Appeal can give him is contained in the judgment
of Lindley LJ in <b>Stuart
v Bell</b>; `the question of moral or social duty being for the judge, each
judge must decide it as best he can for himself. I take moral or
social duty to
mean a duty recognised by English people of ordinary intelligence and moral
principle, but at the same time not a
duty enforceable by legal proceedings,
whether civil or criminal. ................. .
<P>

Is the Judge merely to give his own view of moral and social duty, though he
thinks a considerable portion of the community hold
a different opinion? Or is
he to endeavour to ascertain what view `the great mass of right-minded men'
would take? It is not surprising
that with such a standard both Judges and
text-writers treat the matter as one of great difficulty in which no definite
line can
be drawn."
<P>

17  	But, if <i>"no definite line can be drawn", </i>various judicial
attempts have been made to draw a broadly settled one. Those attempts do not go
ultimately, - and probably could
never do so, - beyond averring that everything
depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. A good example is
provided
in the following extract from the speech of Earl Loreburn LC in
<b>James v Baird</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281916%29%20SC%20%28HL%29%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1916) S.C (H.L) 158</a> at 163-164, as cited in <b>Gatley on
Libel and Slander</b>: Ninth Edition: at page [331]:
<P>

"In considering the question whether the occasion was an occasion of privilege,
the court will regard the alleged libel and will
examine to whom it was
published, when, why, and in what circumstances it was published, and will see
whether these things establish
a relation between the parties which gives rise
to a social or moral right or duty, and the consideration of these things may
involve
the consideration of questions of public policy."
<P>

18  	In the case of the subject book, the relevant circumstances and
considerations are, in my opinion, as follows:
<P>

(1)	The book was published in 1986. By that time the plaintiff's probity had
been subjected to sustained, repeated, searching, critical
and public
attack.
<P>

(2)	Findings adverse to the plaintiff's probity had been made, publicly, by
Wood J; and adverse comments about the plaintiff's probity
had been made,
publicly, by Murphy J in the High Court of Australia. All of those comments are
picked up in terms in the Foreword
to the subject book. 
<P>

(3)	By the time the subject book was published, Wood J had delivered his
Report; the Ananda Marga Three had been pardoned and released;
and the
plaintiff had departed the scene, burdened by his experiences, and having to
make, as best he could in the wake of those
experiences, something of the
remainder of his life.
<P>

(4)	The subject book shone a new, and a very sharp and unflattering light onto
the plaintiff. It characterised the plaintiff, in
the clearest and most
uncompromising fashion, as a wilful perjurer who had not scrupled to lie away
the liberty of three innocent
men. As I have earlier remarked, the subject book
interwove closely and tightly its criticisms of the plaintiff, and its
criticisms
of the police, and the security intelligence, services, and of the
judicial system. 
<P>

(5)	That those views of the defendant, expressed as trenchantly as they were in
fact, were views honestly and reasonably held, -
as the defendant of course
contends, and as I will assume for the purpose of the present particular
discussion, - cannot be, in my
opinion, decisive of the question whether there
was, in the requisite legal sense, a duty, social or moral, to give voice to
them.
<i>A fortiori</i>, when voice was so given in a book published to the
world at large, and under cover of a Foreword, written by an apparently
informed
and independent author, proclaiming to that same world at large that
the defendant <i>"with superb clarity, as in a diagram ......has preserved for
ever the injustice wrought on these three innocent men, and the evils
of their
wrong conviction"</i>.
<P>

	(6)	Nor can it be, in my opinion, decisive that the book was published for
lawful commercial gain to the defendant. But that is,
in my opinion, a factor
of some real weight. It would be wrong to see the publication of the subject
book as having been simply an
altruistic exercise.
<P>

	(7)	There was no particular, relevant personal relationship between the
plaintiff and the defendant. If public policy looks askance,
as it has been
held repeatedly to do, at the extension of qualified privilege to general
defamatory publications by newspapers, telecasts
and radio broadcasts, then
there would seem to me to be no logical reason why the same approach should not
apply to a general defamatory
publication in the form of a book. I think that
any reasonably well-read and well-informed members of the contemporary
Australian
community would think that McHugh J's observations about <i>`the low
quality and sensational nature of significant parts of the late nineteenth
century and twentieth century media' </i>would all too readily embrace books,
and in particular books of occasional political, social and moral content.
<P>

	(8)	The defendant submitted that publication at large of the subject book
equated to <i>"a public meeting on a topic of public concern, available to all,
but likely to be attended only by those with a special interest
in the topic;
such a meeting is normally regarded as an occasion of qualified
privilege"</i>.
<P>

	I do not accept that submission. <i>"A public meeting ...........available to
all"</i> is precisely that; and a person who uses it as an occasion for the
publication of defamatory untruths should not be encouraged to
expect, and is
in my opinion not entitled to expect, that he can so conduct himself with
impunity as of course.
<P>

	(9)	Doing my best to bring into a sensible balance all of the foregoing
matters, I have come to the conclusion that the defendant
has not established
on the probabilities the existence of a social or moral duty incumbent upon him
at the time of the publication
of the subject book, and apt to attract to that
occasion of publication the defence of common law qualified privilege. 
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Statutory Qualified Privilege</u></b>
<P>

19  	Once again it is convenient to begin by noting the terms of the
defendant's pleading. They are as follows:
<P>

"(ii)	<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">DEFAMATION ACT</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">SECTION 22</a></u>
<P>

(a)	the subject or subjects of the matter complained of were the matters of
public interest stated above;
<P>

(b)	the Defendant ........(relies) ........ upon that interest and apparent
interest;
<P>

(c)	the reasonable grounds for the defendant's relief that the recipients of

(d)	the reasonable grounds for the Defendant's belief that the recipient were

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council approved the view, expressed by the New
South Wales Court of Appeal in <b>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2

added its own observation that the Act <i>"was clearly intended to widen the
scope of the common law defence of qualified privilege"</i> [  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20AC%20312D" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) AC, 312D</a>
and G ].
<P>

23  	In applying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a>, as thus construed, to the defendant's book, it
is necessary to define clearly what constitutes the <i>"subject"</i>, the
giving of <i>"information"</i> about which is said to attract the statutory
privilege. 
<P>

24  	In my opinion the <i>"subject"</i> of the defendant's book can
be defined as: "<i>whether justice, or injustice, was done to Messrs. Anderson,
Alister and Dunn in, and in connection with, the connected sequence of
curial
and judicial proceedings to which they were parties"</i>.<i> </i>
<P>

25  	It must next be asked, in the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22(1)(a)</a>, whether the
defendant has proved on the balance of probabilities that <i>"the
recipient"</i> had an interest, or an apparent interest, in having information
on that subject matter. The following points thereupon call for
consideration.
<P>

26  	<i>First</i>, the notion of <i>"the recipient" </i>cannot be
given any precise definition because the subject book was put, upon
publication, on general sale to the public. The defendant
gave, in that
connection, the following evidence which was not contradicted and which I
therefore accept:
<P>

"Q.	Do you remember, off hand, your sales figures on it - I know I have asked
you this before, but it was in excess of 3,000 in
paper back?
<P>

A.	No, it was only just over 3,000. If you are asking me my recollection, it
was in the very low thousand 3,000. That was the total
print run. By no means
were all of those sold, because I still have probably 200 at home and at one
stage I gave away a considerable
number to people I knew who were lecturers at
university law schools and they gave them to their students. I couldn't tell
you how
many, but in some hundreds. I think they came in boxes of 25 books; 20
hard books, which there are very few, and 25 paper book which
were heavy and I
remember delivering some number of the books to those people, which reinforced
my views about the prospects of the
sale of such a book." (trial transcript 237
(40) - (55)
<P>

27  	The effect of this evidence is, in my opinion, that the
recipients of the book comprised, at least:
<P>

(a)	persons who actually bought and read the book; and
<P>

(b)	persons who did not themselves buy the book, but were given it, in
whatsoever particular circumstances, to read and who then
read it.
<P>

28  	It is not possible further to quantify that total readership.
This aspect of the present case is not like, for example, the
corresponding
aspect of the case of <b>Austin</b>, previously cited. There, the publication
was in a major metropolitan daily newspaper, having a circulation, as noted by
the Privy
Council, in the order of 353,000 copies. Here, the probable reach of
the publication was much less extensive. Of course, that is
not to say that it
was in any sense insignificant. The distribution throughout the general
community of, as it would seem from the
evidence, in the order of 2,000 copies
of the subject book, was more than wide enough to do a great deal of real
damage to the reputation
of anyone who was imputed by the book to be a proven
liar and perjurer who had made a major contribution to an appalling miscarriage
of public justice.
<P>

29  	<i>Secondly</i>, it has to be decided whether the
<i>"recipient"</i>, thus understood, had <i>"an interest or an apparent
interest"</i> in receiving <i>"information"</i> on the <i>"subject"</i>, as
previously defined, of the defendant's book.
<P>

30  	In this connection, the advising of the Privy Council in
<b>Austin</b> establishes the following propositions:
<P>

"1.	<i>Information</i>, in this particular statutory context, embraces both
fact and opinion.
<P>

 2.	<i>Interest</i>, in that same context, embraces <i>"any matter of genuine
interest"</i> to the readership of the subject book; <i>"and there are as many
matters of opinion that will be of general interest to the readership
.........as there are facts upon which
such opinions are based"</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20AC%20313A" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) AC,
313A</a>
<P>

31  	The principles thus established entail, in my opinion, that the
defendant has plainly satisfied the requirements of paragraphs
(a) and (b) of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)</a> of the Act. 
<P>

32  	It remains for the defendant, if he is to succeed on the defence
of statutory qualified privilege, to satisfy on the probabilities
the
requirements of paragraph (c) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1).</a> Once again, it is useful to
begin by setting in place some basic propositions.
<P>

33  	<i>First</i>, paragraph (c) focuses on the defendant's conduct
in connection with the publication, not of the book as a whole, but of the
defamatory
imputation carried by the published material: "<i>The more serious
the imputation, the greater the obligation on the defendant to ensure that his
conduct in relation to it was reasonable"</i>: <b>Morgan v John Fairfax &amp;
Sons Ltd (No. 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 374</a> per Hunt AJA at 387E.
<P>

34  	<i>Secondly</i>, what conduct is <i>"reasonable in the
circumstances"</i> of a given case will depend upon the particular facts of
that case. It is, however, possible to define certain factors that are of
general application. It is convenient to do so by way of further reference to
the judgment of Hunt AJA in <b>Morgan</b>. His Honour says:
<P>

"The defendant must also establish: 
<P>

(a)	that, before publishing the matter complained of, he exercised reasonable
care to ensure that he got his conclusions right,
(where appropriate), by
making proper enquiries and checking on the accuracy of his sources;
<P>

(b)	that his conclusion (whether statements of fact or expressions of opinion)
followed logically, fairly and reasonably from the
information which he had
obtained;
<P>

(c)	that the manner and extent of the publication did not exceed what was
reasonably required in the circumstances; and
<P>

(d)	that each imputation intended to be conveyed was relevant to the subject
about which he is giving information to his readers."<i>: </i>see at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20388B%2fC" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23
NSWLR, 388B/C.</a>
<P>

35  	<i>Thirdly, </i>there being on the facts of the present case no
doubt at all that the defendant intended to convey the defamatory imputation in
question,
the defendant must satisfy the Court on the probabilities that he
believed in the truth of that imputation: <b>Morgan</b> per Hunt AJA at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20387F" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991)
23 NSWLR 387F.</a>
<P>

36  	As to the third matter in the foregoing sequence, I am satisfied
that the defendant did have in fact that belief. The defendant
himself gave
clear and positive evidence to that effect. I do not see that the evidence was
either wholly destroyed, or shaken in
its substance, by cross-examination. I
accept that part of the defendant's evidence. 
<P>

37  	As to the four matters (a)-(d) previously mentioned, I am of the
opinion that the factor (d) is clearly established on the
face of the published
material. Whether the other three factors, (a) - (c) have been established by
the defendant on the probabilities,
depends upon an analysis of the relevant
evidence given at trial.
<P>

38  	In his evidence in-chief, the defendant said that he had first
become interested in the case of the Ananda Marga Three in 1979.
He was working
at the time for the A.B.C. producing radio programmes. His attention was drawn
to the first of the two trials, which
was then current. The defendant did not
spend any great length of time at this first hearing; but he did drop in to it
from time
to time. The impression that it made on him, he explained as
follows:
<P>

"I was particularly struck, from the sections of the case that I attended, by
some aspects of it which seemed to me somewhat unusual
- illogical, is the best
single word perhaps. Among which I now remember as perhaps the only clear
example what always struck me
and still does as the bizarreness of somebody
driving a car with two people in it who, on his account, agreed to send off a
bomb
if they're stopped, when he has arranged for surveillance of what they are
doing, and it is at least reasonably likely that they're
going to be
stopped.
<P>

I remember walking back from one occasion when I was at that trial when
thinking about that event said, thinking of that, it was
extremely puzzling and
bizarre and anti-logical."
<P>

39  	When it came to his notice that the jury had not been able to
agree upon a verdict in the case of any one of the three accused
persons, and
that there was to be in consequence a second trial, the defendant made it his
business to attend parts of that trial
also. His best recollection was that he
had seen, in that connection, at least a part of the plaintiff's evidence as it
was being
given.
<P>

40  	The defendant said that he had remembered aspects of the two
trials over the following years until 1981 when he had conceived
the idea of
looking again at the trials as potential sources of material from which he
might fashion one or more radio programmes
of the kind which he was then
producing. The defendant did in fact obtain various materials connected with
the two trials; and did
in due course produce and broadcast two one-hour radio
programmes. There ensued some listener feed-back, the tenor of some of which
tended to strengthen the defendant's own growing conviction that there was
something amiss in the convictions of the Ananda Marga
Three. The defendant
described as follows what then ensued:
<P>

"By that stage, I can't pin it down precisely, but around that time, I had
become fairly firmly persuaded that the case was, in
fact, a serious
miscarriage of justice. When I say `by that stage', I mean after I had done all
the work and put those programmes
together. At some point around there, perhaps
up to a year or so after I made the programmes, again I can't tie that down
exactly,
I decided that I should write a book about the case."
<P>

41  	And so, the defendant set to work on the writing of the subject
book. The exercise took a long time, being done intermittently
and as
opportunities arose; and being necessarily interrupted from time to time by
developments concerning the cases of the three
convicted men, principally in
the form of the Hilton bombing inquest and of the subsequent inquiry conducted
by Wood J. The defendant
described as follows what he had been trying to
achieve as he progressed with the writing of the subject book:
<P>

"I wanted the book to be a documentation of all the major aspects of the case
so that people who were concerned about what I saw
as an important public
issue, an important question of public interest, those who were willing to
spend the effort to search out
the book, by whatever means, and willing to
spend the time and effort of writing (sic: but read `reading') a fairly
sizeable treatment,
would have something available to them so that they could
find out great and complex details about it which they have no chance of
getting from any other source."
<P>

42  	The defendant attended the whole of the Hilton bombing inquest.
After its conclusion he obtained a transcript and <i>"a large amount of
associated material"</i>, the precise details of which the defendant could not
recall except to say that it included witness statements of the various
witnesses
and some additional material such as police running sheets.
Thereafter the defendant continued work on the subject book. 
<P>

43  	In due course, the inquiry conducted by Wood J was formally
established. The defendant made contact with various of the professional
legal
representatives of Messrs. Anderson, Alister and Dunn; and was eventually
retained formally as part of the team of such representatives
acting on behalf
of the three petitioners before the inquiry. The defendant's work in that
connection occupied him full-time from
August 1984 to February 1985. The
defendant was closely involved in the inquiry. Part of that involvement
concerned the preparation
of the detailed submissions made to Wood J on behalf
of the three petitioners. At the conclusion of the inquiry the defendant was
in
possession of a very large amount of transcript and ancillary documentation
deriving from the work done in connection with the
enquiry.
<P>

44  	After the conclusion of the inquiry, the defendant continued to
write the subject book, working from time to time in what spare
time he had
from his other personal and professional preoccupations. After the publication
of Wood J's report, the defendant obtained
a copy of the report and studied it
closely. He found himself in agreement with parts of it and in disagreement
with other parts
of it.
<P>

45  	The defendant finished writing the subject book <i>"somewhere in
late 1985"</i>. He was not optimistic about finding a commercial publisher for
the work; and, ultimately, he published it himself but had it distributed
to
the retail trade by a commercial distributor.
<P>

46  	The defendant, having given the evidence which I have
summarised, described as follows his approach, over all, to the writing
of the
subject book:
<P>

The writing of the book was a quite vast effort, really. I tried throughout to
carefully cross check everything I wrote. I believe
I did. Indeed, I would say
I went through an exercise of some scupulousness in ensuring that I was, to the
best of my ability, accurately
representing the events I described and the
material I was reproducing.
<P>

The account of the inquiry in particular was a very difficult one, because it
was an exercise not only in compression, but finding
a workable narrative shape
to fit it all into. One of the difficulties with detailed analysis is that it
often stops dead the momentum
of the narrative and there is considerable
difficulty in finding an accommodation between those two. I don't know if I
succeeded,
but I am very conscious that one of the difficult aspects of the
task was to find some accommodation that developed a narrative and
also which
has an inter-relationship between things in a progress order and also to get
successfully into a detailed analysis of
things.
<P>

I was well conscious there were selections to be made. There were things I
decided not to include. There were a number of, for example,
arguments in
favour of the petitioners' case. I think a number of findings made in a general
case which would be in their interests
by Justice Wood which I regarded as,
let's say, second rank, less important, and probably fairly represented in
their nature by other
matters that I regarded as more important and some of
those second rank things are left out. In the nature of the inquiry, I thought
that was quite inevitable if any treatment of practical length was to be
devised.
<P>

The complaint in this case, the imputation complained of, that the plaintiff
framed members of the Ananda Marga by committing perjury,
is something I have
believed for a very long time - it is still my belief now. It certainly was
throughout the time of writing and
publishing the book. It became intensified
by some of the matters which surfaced at the inquiry.
<P>

I should say I do not claim now to be able to revisit, to recall, the whole
process mentally or physically that I went through in
researching the book and
writing it. At this distance, any attempt by me to do that is likely to be a
recreation of what I thought
I would have done rather than what I actually did.
I can't account now for the process by which I originally arrived at that
conclusion.
I think I was fairly firm in it, at least after the Hilton Inquest
- from then on.
<P>

My reasons for that belief are in the book and I don't know that sensibly I
could put them in any priority order and there is a
cumulative effect, in any
event, as between them."
<P>

47  	The plaintiff rounded out this summary of his approach to the
subject book by explaining that he had chosen the illustrations
which appear
throughout the subject book; and that he had done so having in mind, in
particular, what he saw as the importance of
recreating in the mind of a
reader, in so far as that was possible: <i>"....... the rather over-excited
atmosphere of the time, as I judge it in some respects ......"</i>.
<P>

48  	The defendant went on to explain that he had taken particular
care to give as full and as fair an account as he could of the
case against the
Ananda Marga Three, as well as the case in their favour. He said that his
approach had been that it was not possible
<i>"with credibility or honesty for
that matter, effectively (to) take apart a case without first acknowledging
what its strengths are,
what its high points are. I thought it was necessary to
reproduce in quite extensive form the precise terms of the evidence against
the
three men in relation to the Yagoona matter; and that is really the reason why
there are such extensive verbatim extracts from
the transcript of the second
trial, being the one which secured the convictions, throughout the chapters
which deal with the afternoon
of Thursday, 15 June, the question of crossing
Carillon Avenue and who got the bomb, the events out at Yagoona and the events
back
at Newtown with the press releases."</i>
<P>

49  	The defendant explained, finally in his evidence in-chief, that
there had been of necessity an element of compression in the
composition and
structure of the subject book; that it had been necessary on that account to
make particular judgments concerning
the inclusion or the exclusion of various
matters of detail; but that he had sought to keep, overall, a fair balance
having regard
to the over-riding objective of the subject book, which was to
bring to the public attention what he, the defendant, himself believed
genuinely then, and believes genuinely now, to have been a serious miscarriage
of public justice deriving in large part from the
perjury of the plaintiff.
<P>

50  	The defendant was extensively cross-examined. Two or three
different particular lines of cross-examination were followed by
the
cross-examiner; but, in one way or another, they all had to do with a constant
theme, namely, the propositions, put repeatedly
to the defendant in
cross-examination, that he had been, from the first, a partisan ally of the
Ananda Marga Three; and that this
partisanship had caused him to ignore
material available to him in connection with the writing of the subject book
and either casting
the Ananda Marga movement in an unflattering light; or
reflecting favourably, at least to some extent however limited, upon the
plaintiff.
<P>

51  	I have come to the conclusion that the defendant's evidence is,
to speak in general terms, reliable and truthful; and I accept
it. I do not
accept that the available evidence, considered fairly, demonstrates
partisanship on the part of the defendant of so
extreme a kind as led to his
deliberate suppression in the subject book of material, then available to him,
and capable if accepted
of contradicting the substance of the imputation which
is now in point.
<P>

52  	I have come to the conclusion that the defendant has established
on the probabilities each of the matters referred to in the
paragraphs (a), (b)
and (c), as set out in paragraph 35 of this judgment. It follows that, in my
opinion, the defendant has established
the defence of statutory qualified
privilege. Whether that defence has been successfully rebutted by proof of
malice in the defendant
is a separate question to which I shall return later in
this judgment.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Comment</u></b>
<P>

53  	Once again, I shall leave for later consideration in this
judgment the question of malice in the defendant.
<P>

54  	Malice apart, the defendant must establish on the probabilities
that the relevant imputation is:
<P>

(i)	a comment rather than a statement of fact;
<P>

(ii)	that it is a comment referable to what is described in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the Act as
<i>"proper material for comment"</i>;
<P>

(iii)	that the comment relates to a matter of public interest; and
<P>

(iv)	that the comment, at the time it was made, represented the opinion of the
defendant.
<P>

55  	In the present case, it seems to me to be clear that the
relevant imputation is carried by the subject book as a matter of
comment on
the part of the defendant. I think that the imputation represents, upon a fair
reading of the subject book, a fundamental
thesis or conclusion for which the
defendant argues upon the basis of the material that he canvasses in the
book.
<P>

56  	The statutory concept of <i>"proper material for comment"</i> is
the subject of definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30(1)</a> of the Act. Broadly speaking, material
will be regarded as <i>"proper material for comment"</i> if it fits within any
one of three nominated categories, namely:
<P>

(a)	a statement of fact; or
<P>

(b)	a protected report within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24</a> of the Act, or
<P>

(c)	material upon which, for some other reason, comment might be based for the
purposes of this particular defence.
<P>

57  	The defendant submits that the imputation now relevant is
comment made by him upon the substance of a number of proceedings,
reports of
which are protected reports within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24</a> of the Act. Schedule 2
to the Act specifies a number of different kinds of proceedings for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24.</a> Those specified categories of proceedings include:
<P>

"(5)  Proceedings in public of a court; 
<P>

(6)  Proceedings in public of an inquiry held under the legislation of any
country or held under the authority of the government
of any country."
<P>

58  	The defendant submits that the material upon which his
defamatory comment is based comprises the whole sequence of judicial
and
quasi-judicial proceedings to which reference is made early in this judgment;
that is to say, the committal proceedings against
Messrs. Anderson, Alister and
Dunn; their two subsequent trials and the appeal proceedings consequent upon
those trials; the inquest
into the bombing of the Hilton Hotel; and the inquiry
conducted by Wood J. The defendant submits that all of these proceedings fit
either of the two specified categories referred to above.
<P>

59  	In my opinion, these submissions of the defendant are correct.
The subject book seems to me to report fairly the substance
of each set of the
relevant proceedings; and by so doing to constitute within the subject book a
body of material correctly described
as <i>"proper material for comment"</i> in
the requisite statutory sense.
<P>

60  	There is uncontradicted evidence from the defendant that the
comment, at the time it was made, did indeed represent his honest
opinion. I
accept that evidence.
<P>

61  	I am satisfied as to the existence of the requisite element of
public interest. That there had been a serious miscarriage of
public justice
leading to the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of these innocent men; and
that a prime factor in the occurrence
of that miscarriage had been perjured
evidence by the plaintiff, given in order to cause that miscarriage; were, in
my opinion, clear
matters of public interest.
<P>

62  	I am of the opinion, therefore, that, subject to its rebuttal by
reason of malice in the defendant, this particular defence
has been
established.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Truth</u></b>
<P>

63  	By reason of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.15</a> of the Act, the defendant
cannot succeed on this defence unless he establishes on the probabilities that
the relevant imputation:
<P>

1.	is a matter of substantial truth; and
<P>

2.	<i>either</i> relates to a matter of public interest <i>or</i> is published
under qualified privilege.
<P>

64  	For reasons already explained, I am of the opinion that the
relevant imputation both relates to a matter of public interest,
and was
published under statutory qualified privilege. The only remaining issue is,
therefore, whether the defendant has established
on the probabilities that the
imputation is substantially true.
<P>

65  	In that connection, the appropriate starting point is, I think,
a realistic appreciation of the extreme gravity of the allegation
which is made
against the plaintiff by the relevant imputation. In such a context, it is very
much to the point that there be kept
carefully in mind the principles, a
classic definition of which is to be found in the judgment of Dixon J in
<b>Briginshaw v Briginshaw &amp; anor </b>[1938) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=60%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">60 CLR 336</a> at 361, 362. The
relevant passage reads as follows:
<P>

"Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that
the affirmative of an allegation is made out to
the reasonable satisfaction of
the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is
attained or established independently
of the nature and consequence of the fact
or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent
unlikelihood
of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the
consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations
which must
affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In
such matters `reasonable
satisfaction' should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony,
or indirect inferences. Everyone
must feel that, when, for instance, the issue
is on which of two dates an admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory
conclusion
may be reached on materials of a kind that would not satisfy any
sound and prudent judgment if the question was whether some act
had been done
involving grave moral delinquency."
<P>

66  	The succinct and helpful written submissions put in by the
defendant outline with complete clarity the factual bases for the
contention of
the defendant that the relevant imputation can be demonstrated, to the
requisite standard of proof, to be substantially
true. A paraphrase of the
defendant's outline will not do, I think, justice to what is being argued. I
have therefore adopted the
expedient of attaching to the present judgment a
photocopy of the relevant portions of the defendant's written submissions.
<P>

67  	It will be seen from what follows that, in coming to a
conclusion upon the issue of substantial truth, - (and in coming, later
herein,
to a conclusion concerning the related defence of contextual truth), - I rely
heavily upon the findings made by Wood J in
his Honour's report of May 1985,
being the report of the Inquiry, earlier herein referred to, held by his Honour
under s.475 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b> <b>(NSW)</b>. Volumes 1 and 2 of his
Honour's report are exhibit O in the present proceedings, having been so
received in evidence upon a tender
by the plaintiff. The contents of those two
volumes have, therefore, legitimate standing as evidence available for my
consideration
in connection with the present proceedings. I acknowledge, at
once, that it would be entirely inappropriate for me simply to transpose
into
the different context of the present proceedings, conclusions reached by Wood J
in connection with his Honour's Inquiry; and
I have been careful throughout not
to make any such simplistic and undiscriminating transposition. I have kept in
mind, throughout,
that the weight to be given for my present purposes to any of
the particular conclusions reached by Wood J must be considered in
the light of
any relevant evidence particular to the present proceedings.
<P>

68  	All of that said, I think, nevertheless, that it is proper to
give considerable weight to the conclusions reached by Wood J.
I say so for the
following reasons.
<P>

69  	<i>First</i>, it is apparent on the face of Exhibit O that Wood
J was able to enquire, with a breadth and in a depth wholly beyond the scope of
the evidence in the recent hearing in this Court, into the details and
complexities of the facts and circumstances out of which there
emerged the
committal proceedings, the two trials, and the Hilton bombing inquest, to all
of which I have previously made reference.

<P>

70  	<i>Secondly</i>, Wood J had the advantage, which I did not
enjoy, of top-level and independent legal professional representation of all
interested
parties who were heard by his Honour during the course of the
Inquiry. One has only to read the list of acknowledgments on page 453
of the
report, in order to see at a glance the breadth and the depth of the
independent legal professional assistance that was available
to his Honour. At
the recent hearing before this Court, by contrast, the plaintiff represented
himself, as did the defendant. The
defendant is, of course, a practising member
of the Bar. This gave him, vis a vis the plaintiff, obvious forensic
advantages. It
gave him, also, professional learning and experience that were,
if I may say so, of real assistance to the Court. The plaintiff,
on the other
hand, had to do the best he could with virtually no legal professional
assistance. As the trial transcript will show,
the Court had to tread
constantly the fine line between giving some assistance to the plaintiff in
order that he might be, as it
were, pointed in the right direction; and not
interfering in such a way as would raise in the mind of the defendant a
reasonable
apprehension that the Court was losing its necessary
impartiality.
<P>

71  	<i>Thirdly</i>, Wood J had the advantage of seeing the plaintiff
in the witness box. The plaintiff's experience on that occasion moved Wood J to
comment: <i>"There can be few if any witnesses who have been subjected to such
a prolonged and minute attack in the witness box"</i>. Of course, Wood J did
not see the defendant in the witness box, because the defendant actually
appeared as one of three counsel
representing Mr. Alister at the Inquiry. My
experience in the recent trial has been exactly the opposite. I had the
advantage of
hearing the defendant give evidence; and I had the further
advantage of seeing him tested, at least to some extent, by cross-examination.
The plaintiff did not, however, go into the witness box, although he did call
other lay evidence in support of his case. I am not
intending by what I now say
to criticise the plaintiff for not having gone into the witness box. All that I
am saying is that in
fact he did not go into the witness box ; and that the
necessary result is that I have not had anything like the opportunity that
was
available to Wood J for the making of a careful and thorough assessment of the
plaintiff's credit.
<P>

72  	<i>Fourthly,</i> the defendant, as I understand his position,
does not contend that Wood J misapprehended the evidence put before his Honour
at the
Inquiry. The defendant, as is clear from the subject book, takes issue
with various opinions expressed by Wood J; and with what the
defendant sees as
a failure of Wood J to make affirmative findings critical of the police and
intelligence services. But, at least
as to those conclusions of Wood J to which
I hereinafter refer, the defendant, as I understand his position, does not
contend that
such conclusions were not reasonably open to his Honour. 
<P>

73  	It is not possible to be quite so clear-cut about the
corresponding position of the plaintiff. As I have earlier noted, Exhibit
O was
tendered by the plaintiff; and parts of Exhibit O were referred to specifically
in the plaintiff's submissions. Of course,
the plaintiff would not accept the
correctness of the adverse findings about him which Wood J made; but that is
not to say that such
findings were not reasonably open to his Honour.
<P>

74  	The particular matters of fact and circumstance to which the
defendant points in his written submissions seem to me to reproduce
the
substance of submissions made to Wood J. 
<P>

75  	In dealing more particularly with the submissions now put by the
defendant, it is convenient to begin with a consideration
of the submissions
that are put under the heading: <i>"(iii) The Journey to Yagoona"</i>.
<P>

76  	The issue thus raised by the defendant in the present
proceedings seems to me to equate to an issue which was raised before
Wood J,
and which his Honour describes at pages 356 and 357 of his Honour's report in
the following way:
<P>

"The Journal
<P>

At the committal, Seary produced a bound notebook which he described as part of
a diary of his life, and loose papers which he said
were notes for entries to
be later included in the diary. Together these documents came to be known as
his journal.
<P>

The loose notes included a nine-page account of the events of 15th June, which
Seary said at the committal, and at the inquest,
was probably written on 17th
June, 1978. In this section were included conversations, implicating the
Petitioners in the Hilton bombing,
which were almost identical with the record
of interview given on 22nd June. The similarities between these documents is
shown in
the comparative table within appendix M. This was the record of
interview in which Seary first provided the evidence of Ananda Marga
implication in the bombing.
<P>

It was submitted by the Petitioners that only one inference was open. Seary, it
was said, composed an entirely fictional account
which he wrote into this
journal, and then learned by heart."
<P>

77  	There follows a detailed canvass by Wood J of the relevant
evidence given to his Honour's Inquiry. His Honour then sums up
as follows his
conclusions:
<P>

"It is difficult to know what to make of this journal. There are internal
inconsistencies if it was intended as a factual account,
and there are
indications suggestive of a building of the story in the way seen in the
records of interview. On the other hand, there
are some obstacles to the
Petitioners' submissions. For example, it was Detective Inspector Sheather who
decided to interview Seary
in relation to the Hilton bombing and who asked to
see Seary on 22nd June. No prior warning had been given which would have
allowed
a drafting and rehearsal of the allegations. Further, had Seary been
minded to frame the Petitioners from a rehearsed script, it
was unlikely he
would have produced the document at the committal, albeit reluctantly. It may
be that the writings were made after
the event given his predilection for
reducing his thoughts to paper. It may also be that this was done bona fide in
an attempt to
ensure accuracy in his disclosures.
<P>

No additional material was produced before the Inquiry to assist in the
resolution of this issue. I think it proper, however, to
regard the journal as
yet another curious facet in the Seary disclosures, particularly as he was
equivocal as to its true nature
and accuracy. When it was first produced, it
was claimed to be part of a continuous diary or record of his life. During the
Inquiry
it was described as a series of separate notes written as `a way of
expressing my thoughts'. The notes, he said, were neither complete,
nor
necessarily accurate records of the events recorded. He later said that there
was some purposeful inaccuracies because `there
was always a chance that
someone else would read it and I did not want to keep a perfectly accurate
record of what went on because
I did not want people to know'. He added that
`if it wasn't completely factual, I could deny it, if other people saw it'.
This may
have been true. Equally, in my view, it was an indication of a
willingness to invent an answer on the spur of the moment to deflect
an
embarrassing question."
<P>

78  	I do not see in the evidence available to me anything that would
lead logically to a conclusion differing from that expressed
by Wood J. Simply
to read the passages of the subject book to which the defendant refers in his
written outline, re-states rather
than resolves the issue.
<P>

79  	Turning next to that part of the defendant's outline under the
heading:<i> "(ii) The Reporting of the Plot to the Police"</i>, it will be seen
that the substance of what is there argued by the defendant turns in a very
real sense upon one's approach to Tape
9. The report of Wood J gives extended
and careful consideration to the authenticity of the tape recordings, including
Tape 9, of
debriefings by the police of the plaintiff. At pages 393 and 394 of
his Honour's report, and dealing with a subject described as
<i>"Debriefing
Anomalies"</i>, Wood J expresses the following conclusions:
<P>

"When Seary's evidence in relation to the petitioners is carefully examined, in
the light of the additional information and documents
available to the Inquiry,
cause for concern arises. There are inconsistencies apparent in the different
versions he recorded, in
his own writings, in debriefing sessions, in records
of interview, and in sworn evidence given in the various Courts and
administrative
Inquiries before which the matter has come. In some respects,
the material he has provided appears bizarre and improbable. In other
respects,
it appears not to accord with known facts. Explanations have been given which
are not always capable of ready acceptance,
or which are themselves
contradictory. The information Seary provided implicating the Petitioners has
tended to become more detailed.
Most noticeably, after several days of silence
the Petitioners' criminal activity was expanded beyond the Yagoona affair to
the Hilton
bombing. 
<P>

These matters cannot be considered in isolation from the independent evidence,
which for the reasons identified in chapter 10, gives
rise to a circumstantial
case against the Petitioners on which a jury properly instructed could have
convicted. The questions that
ultimately arise, however, are these:
<P>

Were the Petitioners and police carefully manoeuvred into position by Seary,
and the extrinsic facts skilfully manipulated by him,
so that a well forged
circumstantial case might appear? Alternatively, did the events transpire in
the general way that Seary described,
leaving him in a position where,
convinced of the petitioners' guilt yet fearful that the Crown case may not be
water-tight, he was
prepared to embellish and fill in the areas where he
suspected problems might arise?
<P>

Although I incline to the latter view, I am satisfied that the first
alternative cannot be excluded. ........................"
<P>

80  	Subject to one consideration, I do not see anything in the
evidence before this Court that would enable it to come to any more
precise a
conclusion than that reached by Wood J.
<P>

81  	The one additional consideration has to do with Tape 9 itself.
It was urged by the defendant that I should listen to it for
myself. I have
attempted to do so, using in the attempt two different tape recording machines.
In each case, the tape would not reproduce
any of the sounds encoded on it. As
best I cant judge, the reason for this malfunction has to do in some way with
the tape rather
than with the machine.
<P>

82  	There remain the submissions put under the heading: <i>  "(i)
The Plot Alleged by the plaintiff"</i>
<P>

83  	Once again, the anomalies and the inconsistencies to which the
submissions refer were the subject of submissions to, and of
extensive
consideration by, Wood J. So far as I can see from the relevant portions of his
Honour's report, Wood J accepted that these
anomalies and inconsistencies cast
shadows of doubt over the plaintiff's version of relevant events; but stopped
short of anything
in the nature of a positive finding that the plaintiff had
given perjured evidence in connection with those events.
<P>

84  	Once again, I am unable to see in the evidence before this Court
anything that compels, logically, any different conclusion.

<P>

85  	Before concluding what I have to say about this particular
defence, I wish to draw attention to some of the final conclusions
expressed by
Wood J in connection with the credit and the reliability of the present
plaintiff.
<P>

86  	Speaking of the plaintiff's general reliability, his Honour
expressed this final view:
<P>

"I am satisfied that the evidence concerning Seary's background and his
everyday dealings, and the expert evidence, showed him to
be a person of
considerable intelligence and imagination, who craved recognition and status,
and who was willing to exaggerate, bend
the truth, and lie in appropriate
circumstances. I am not satisfied that he was proved to be a mentally disturbed
and committed liar
or fantasiser, or to be incapable of giving truthful
evidence. I am, however, satisfied that a very serious question mark exists
in
relation to his general reliability, and that if he was minded to fabricate a
case against the Petitioners, he could have done
so with considerable
persuasion."
<P>

87  	Wood J then turned more particularly to the assessment of the
evidence given by the plaintiff in connection with the Yagoona
incident. As to
that, Wood J expressed these conclusions:
<P>

"I am satified that significant inconsistencies and anomalies were identified
in the evidence, debriefings and writings of Seary,
concerning the Yagoona
affair. I am further satisfied that there is a real possibility of his evidence
in relation to this matter
being false. This may have occurred either in
pursuance of a contrived plan on his part, to entrap and frame the Petitioners
for
 crimes of which they were innocent, or out of a misguided desire on his
part to strengthen the Crown case against the Petitioners
in respect of crimes
of which they were guilty. Each is available as a rational inference."
<P>

88  	Relevantly for present purposes, Wood J expressed as follows,
and in the concluding section of his Honour's report, what his
Honour described
as his: <i>"Overall Conclusion"</i>:
<P>

"I am satisfied that an inference exists that Seary manipulated the Petitioners
(and the police), and carefully caused the events
to be so ordered as to
present an apparently strong case against them. I form this conclusion, having
regard to my assessment of
his general reliability and his evidence concerning
the Yagoona affair, notwithstanding the strength of the independent evidence.
While I am unable to say that this is the correct inference to be drawn, it is
sufficient for my inquiry to state that it is a rational
inference that cannot
be excluded."
<P>

89  	The views expressed in the three extracts which I have just
quoted, express precisely the conclusions that I myself have reached
upon the
much more contained material placed before me in the present proceedings. There
is every reason to suspect that the plaintiff
did what is imputed to him by the
relevant imputation upon which he now sues. But that suspicion, entirely
reasonable as I think
it to be on the basis of the available material, falls
short, and a long way short, of that degree of persuasion which I would need
to
feel before I was prepared to make an affirmative public finding that the
assertions in the relevant imputation are in fact substantially
true. So that
there will be no misunderstanding upon the point, I wish to emphasise in the
plainest terms that what I have just said
does not in any way imply a view on
my part that there is room for an affirmative finding that the relevant
imputation is substantially
untrue. I say no more than that I am not satisfied
to the requisite standard that the defendant has established this particular
essential
element of his defence of truth. It follows necessarily that, in my
opinion, that defence has not been made good by the defendant.
<P>

<b><u>The Defence of Contextual Truth</u></b>
<P>

90  	The defendant has pleaded nine contextual imputations; pleading,
also, that as to each such contextual imputation:
<P>

1.	The imputation is a matter of substantial truth; and
<P>

2.	Related to a matter of public interest; or, in the alternative, was
published under qualified privilege; and
<P>

3.	That by reason of the substantial truth of the contextual implication,
publication of the plaintiff's imputation (b) did not
further injure the
reputation of the plaintiff.
<P>

91  	The nine contextual implications which are thus pleaded by the
defendant are as follows:
<P>

"(i)	The plaintiff had so conducted himself as reasonably to be suspected by
lawyers acting for Tim Anderson, Paul Alister and Ross
Dunn of placing the bomb
at the Hilton Hotel.
<P>

(ii)	The plaintiff was a perjurer;
<P>

(iii)	The plaintiff was a liar;
<P>

(iv)	The plaintiff was a fantasist:
<P>

(v)	The plaintiff was a thief;
<P>

(vi)	The plaintiff knowingly received the proceeds of drug thefts from
pharmacies;
<P>

(vii)	The plaintiff was a drug addict;
<P>

(viii)	The plaintiff was knowingly concerned in acts of supply of illegal
drugs, including heroin, LSD, cocaine and indian hemp;
<P>

(ix)	The plaintiff attempted to procure the bombing of the Homebush
Abbatoir."
<P>

92  	Once again, it is for the defendant to establish, according to
the requisite legal standard as previously herein discussed,
those matters
which must be established in order to make good his defence of contextual
truth. I would say at once that, in my opinion,
any contextual imputation of
the above kinds would relate, in the circumstances of the present particular
case, to a matter of public
interest in the sense discussed and accepted more
than once in what has previously been written herein. 
<P>

93  	<b>As to contextual imputation (i):</b> Wood J, in a section of
his Honour's report entitled: <i>"Seary as the Hilton Bomber?"</i> examines
exhaustively this suggestion. His Honour notes that no proposition that he was
the Hilton bomber was put fairly and squarely
to the plaintiff in accordance
with the rule of practice established by the decision in <b>Browne v Dunn</b>.
His Honour notes that, instead, the plaintiff had been cross-examined about
particular circumstances suggestive of there being reason
to think that he,
himself, had been the Hilton bomber.
<P>

94  	After his Honour's exhaustive canvass of the topic, Wood J
expresses the following conclusion:
<P>

"I am quite unpersuaded on the evidence before me, that there is a prima facie
circumstantial case implicating Seary and the Hilton
bombing. No direct
evidence of his involvement was led, and there was nothing to suggest that
additional material was available to
the police which called for further
inquiry in this regard. The only conclusion reasonably open is that the
identity of the Hilton
bomber or bombers remains at large."
<P>

95  	The evidence before this Court certainly does not improve, in my
opinion, upon the position as thus described.
<P>

96  	I am not satisfied to the requisite legal standard that the
defendant has established the substantial truth of this particular
contextual
imputation.
<P>

97  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (ii):</b>	The written submissions
of the defendant further particularise the alleged perjury. It is said to lie
in the following particular
pieces of the plaintiff's evidence on prior
occasions:
<P>

(a)	Anderson asked him the previous week-end to find Cameron's address.
<P>

(b)	He looked up the address overnight at home in an old phone book.
<P>

(c)	Anderson and Alister synchronised watches.
<P>

(d)	He was unaware of the conversation on Tape 9 being recorded.
<P>

(e)	He had not learned by heart the account of the confession by Alister and
Dunn to the Hilton bombing which he gave to the police.
<P>

(f)	Alister and Dunn had confessed on the journey to Yagoona to having done the
Hilton bombing.
<P>

(g)	He did not know to which papers the press releases were directed.
<P>

(h)	Alister and Dunn resolved on the journey to Yagoona to detonate the bomb if
apprehended.
<P>

(j)	He had not, while a member of Hare Krishna, suggested to other members that
they should bomb the Homebush Abbatoir.
<P>

98  	As to each of the matters thus particularised, with the
exception of that in particular (j), I would not be prepared to make
an
affirmative finding that the plaintiff had committed perjury in the precise
respects propounded by the defendant. In broad terms,
I would reach such a
conclusion by a process of reasoning similar to that which I have canvassed at
length in the immediately preceding
section of this judgment.
<P>

99  	The matter particularised (j) is, in my view, in a different
category. Wood J examined exhaustively this particular matter.
His Honour came
to the conclusion that he <i>"must prefer the evidence of the other witnesses
who gave a consistent account of Seary's activities that was totally contrary
to
his own evidence"</i>. Upon that basis, and for reasons developed in detail
at pages 258-270 of his Honour's report, Wood J reached the conclusion that:
<i>"It is clear that he lied in relation to this matter"</i>.
<P>

100  	There is nothing in the remainder of the evidence before me
that causes me to differ from that conclusion. Upon this aspect
of affairs, I
would be prepared to make an affirmative finding that the plaintiff gave false
evidence on oath to Wood J.
<P>

101  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (iii):</b>	I am satisfied that
this has been established, if by nothing else, by reason of the conclusion to
which I have come in respect of
contextual imputation (ii).
<P>

102  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (iv):</b>	In my opinion, this
imputation, also, has been established. The material in Exhibit O contains a
wealth of evidence supportive of
this contextual imputation. It is to be borne
in mind, of course, that to say of a person that it is substantially true to
describe
him as <i>"a fantasist"</i>, does not permit, without more, of the
drawing of a rational inference that he did what is alleged against him in the
imputation
(b) upon which the present proceedings are based. 
<P>

103  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (v):	</b>The plaintiff has never
denied, as I understand the available evidence, that he stole a motor vehicle
for use in connection with the
Yagoona affair. That alone would establish the
substantial truth of this contextual imputation.
<P>

104  	<b>As to Contextual Imputations (vi), (vii) and (viii):</b>
These are related contextual imputations in that they all concern some aspect
or other of the plaintiff's history, or suggested history,
of drug abuse. 
<P>

105  	These matters, too, were ventilated at the Inquiry conducted by
Wood J. Once again, the allegations were the subject of a
careful and
exhaustive review by his Honour who concluded:
<P>

"I am not satisfied that he could fairly be described ever to have been a
heroin addict. It is clear that he was a drug abuser,
but I think that his
involvement in this field has been exaggerated by him in his dealings with
others. 
<P>

I take the view that by the time of his recruitment the police were entitled to
regard him as a person who had severed his association
with narcotics. I am
convinced that any continued use of drugs during the period March to July 1978
would have been detected by the
police and by the rehabilitation experts with
whom he was in close contact at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre. In the result I
am unable
to conclude that his early history of drug abuse should be held
against him. If anything it indicated some strength of character
in his
successful separation from the drug scene."
<P>

106  	I see nothing in the other material before me that would
entail, logically, any different conclusion. I am not satisfied that
these
contextual imputations have been shown by the defendant to be substantially
true.
<P>

107  	<b>As to Contextual Imputation (ix):</b>	Once again, this
matter is one that attracted a great deal of attention at the Inquiry conducted
by Wood J. Once again, I see nothing
in the evidence before me to indicate,
logically, any different conclusion from that reached by Wood J and as recorded
in the relevant
portions of Exhibit O, and as follows:
<P>

"I am accordingly satisfied that at some time during 1972, the possibility of
damaging the Homebush Abattoirs by means of explosives
was discussed between
persons who were either members or associates of the Hari Krishna movement in
Sydney. Whether it was Seary
who initiated the discussion or someone else, I am
unable to say. I am, however, satisfied that he was involved in the
discussions,
and that he drove at least three persons out to the Abattoirs in
order to show them where the explosives might be placed. It is equally
clear
that the proposal was rejected as totally unacceptable to responsible members
of the movement.
<P>

Whether the discussions were seriously entertained by those involved, or were
simply the products of macabre jest, or wild talk
among young men attracted to
an alternative society, is not apparent. That in discussion, Seary fanned the
embers of a more radical
involvement of the movement in Sydney however cannot
be gainsaid."
<P>

108  	I have found that the contextual imputations (ii) in part,
(iii), (iv), (v) and (ix) are substantially true. The question
has then to be
considered whether the combined effect of those substantially true contextual
imputations is such that their effect
upon the plaintiff's reputation is not
further injured by the imputation (b) on which the plaintiff now sues.
<P>

109  	There is no way in which this question can be answered with
scientific exactness or according to some scientific method. What
is involved
is a question of degree; and the striking of a comparative balance that strives
to reflect the probabilities in the real
world.
<P>

110  	It scarcely needs to be said that the contextual imputations,
the substantial truth of which I am satisfied to have been established,
would
naturally damage the plaintiff's reputation, and damage it significantly, in
the eyes of right-thinking members of the community.
But, for my own part, I
have not been persuaded that such damage to the plaintiff's reputation would,
as it were, simply outweigh
or otherwise neutralise the effect of the
imputation (b) upon which the plaintiff now sues. The notion that a person
would deliberately
contrive to have innocent people convicted of very serious
criminal offences, and would so contrive by the giving of extensive, and
extensively calculated, perjured evidence, strikes me as a notion that
right-thinking and reasonable members of the community would
regard with an
abhorrence greater, at least to some extent, than the abhorrence with which
they would regard a person of whom the
relevant contextual imputations were
substantially true.
<P>

111  	In my opinion, therefore, the defendant has not established on
the probabilities the defence of contextual truth.
<P>

<b><u>Malice</u></b>
<P>

112  	In finding, as I have hitherto done, that the defendant has
established the defences of statutory qualified privilege and
of comment, I
have expressly reserved in each case the question of malice. If the plaintiff
is able to establish malice in the defendant
in connection with the publication
of the subject book, carrying as it does the imputation (b) upon which, in
particular, the plaintiff
sues, then those defences would be defeated. 
<P>

113  	It is usual, in the language of the law, to equate malice with
improper motive. To put the point in that way is, however,
simply to raise the
question of how improper motive itself is to be defined relevantly to the law
of defamation. The learned authors
of <b>Tobin and Sexton: Australian
Defamation Law and Practice</b> propound, on the basis of the relevant
authorities, seven particular instances of malice in the sense now relevant.
They are:
<P>

"(a)	Knowledge of the falsity of the defamatory material or absence of belief
in its truth;
<P>

(b)	Recklessness as to whether the matter complained of was true or false;
<P>

(c)	Failure to inquire as to the truth of the defamatory material;
<P>

(d)	Introduction of material irrelevant to the occasion of qualified
privilege;
<P>

(e)	Manner and extent of publication, including the language in the matter
complained of;
<P>

(f)	Publication of other defamatory material published by the defendant
concerning the plaintiff;
<P>

(g)	Conduct of the litigation by the defendant, including the conduct of the
trial."
<P>

114  	In my opinion, none of the matters referred to above as (a),
(b), (c), (d) and (f) could be found reasonably on the evidence
to hand.
<P>

115  	As to the matter (g), I do not think that a fair view overall
of the course of the recent trial could justify a finding in
the plaintiff's
favour on this particular type of malice. As <b>Tobin and Sexton<i>
</i></b>point out: <i>"</i>An inference of malice drawn from the conduct of the
litigation by the conduct of the trial by the particular defendant is<i>: "an
inference that the courts are likely to be wary of drawing from the conduct by
the defendant, normally through his legal representatives,
of the litigation,
as any other approach might well inhibit a defendant in his pleading of
defences to which he was otherwise entitled"</i>.
<P>

116  	As to the matter (e), it is, I think, fair to say that the
plaintiff, in his submissions on the issue of malice, looked principally
to
this type of conduct. 
<P>

117  	Conduct of this kind needs to be assessed with some care. As
was said by Jordan CJ in <b>Godfrey v Henderson </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1944/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] NSWStRp 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2044%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 44 SR (NSW) 447</a>, at
454:
<P>

"It is of the utmost importance in the case of statements made on occasion of
qualified privilege, that the privilege which the
law casts around such
statements should not be nullified by a readiness to treat as evidence of
express malice destroying the privilege
anything which does not definitely, and
as a matter of common sense, point to the actual existence of some express
malice which was
really operative in the making of the statement; and
substantial evidence is required, not surmise or a mere scintilla."
<P>

118  	There can be, in my view, no denying that the terms of the
subject book are very strong. The book is polemical in tone. It
argues with
clarity, directness, and sometimes with an evident passion, for a point of view
in which it is clear the defendant firmly
believed at the time he wrote the
book; and, indeed, in which he still believes as firmly. The book is rightly
seen by the plaintiff
as scathing in its treatment of him so far as concerns
his conduct in connection with every stage of the proceedings involving Messrs.
Alister, Dunn and Anderson. Those considerations, however, cannot be conclusive
on the question of actual malice. What is to be looked
for in that particular
connection is the true motive of the defendant in writing the subject book,
carrying as it does the defamatory
imputation (b).
<P>

119  	I am comfortably satisfied that it could not be fairly found on
the available evidence that the defendant, in writing the
subject book, was
actuated by express malice, i.e. some express and improper purpose, concerning
the plaintiff. I think that the
reasonable inference to draw from the available
evidence is, overwhelmingly, that the defendant was utterly convinced that a
grievous
miscarriage of justice had occurred in the cases of Messrs. Alister,
Dunn and Anderson; that the fact of the miscarriage, its particular
circumstances, and its implications for the administration of public justice,
all required that there be something done to bring
all of those matters to the
public attention; and that he was particularly well placed to provide that
public information.
<P>

120  	That the subject book is combative in tone and uncompromisingly
pungent in its style, does not establish improper motive in
the author. There
is, so far as I can see, nothing else in the available evidence which, when
brought properly to account, would
add the element or elements necessary to
constitute actual malice.
<P>

121  	I conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff has not made good his
case on the issue of malice.
<P>

<b><u>Damages</u></b>
<P>

122  	Because I have upheld two in particular of the defences as
pleaded, there will be, in the ultimate event, judgment for the
defendant
against the plaintiff. It is a nice question whether, in those circumstances
and in this particular kind of case, I ought
to say anything at all about the
views that I would have been inclined to take on the question of damages had
that question become
a live one for me. I think it would be appropriate to
follow the comparable practice in personal injuries cases, and say something,
however brief, on the question of damages.
<P>

123  	I do not think that it is necessary in that connection to enter
upon a wide-ranging discussion of relevant principle. In my
opinion, the
plaintiff's case does not establish quantifiable damage in the sense of
quantifiable loss actually sustained. The plaintiff
did attempt to introduce
some evidence which seemed to me to be aimed at the proposition that the
effects upon him of the defamatory
imputation had been such as to deprive him
of income which he otherwise would and could have earned in an amount that was
fairly
precisely quantifiable. I do not think that the evidence goes far enough
to establish such a case. 
<P>

124  	As I have earlier remarked, the plaintiff himself did not give
evidence. He did call, however, evidence from two witnesses
on the issue of
damage to his reputation; and as to the effect, more generally, upon him of the
defamatory imputations. I see no
reason not to accept the substance of that
evidence.
<P>

125  	I would have thought it proper to approach the question of
damages upon the basis that the defamation of the plaintiff was
a serious one,
both in its particular terms, and in terms of the circulation given to it. I
would have thought it entirely reasonable
to approach the matter upon the basis
that the publication had caused real hurt to the plaintiff and real damage to
his reputation.
But I would have thought it reasonable, also, to take sensible
account of the practical effects of the way in which the plaintiff's
reputation
had been canvassed in public before the publication of the subject book and of
the particular defamatory imputation carried
by it.
<P>

126  	Taken for all in all, I would have thought that in this
particular case an award in the order of $20,000 would have been a
just
reflection of the harm done by the particular defamatory imputation.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusion and Orders</u></b>
<P>

127  	For the whole of the foregoing reasons, there will be judgment
for the defendant against the plaintiff.
<P>

128  	I will hear the parties on the question of costs.
<P>

129  	The exhibits will remain in Court for a period of 28 days from
today. If within that period there is an appeal against any
part of this
judgment, then the exhibits will remain in Court pending further order;
otherwise the exhibits may then be handed out
to the party respectively
entitled to them.
<P>

<P>

<b>(a)	Truth</b>
<P>

The evidence for this purpose may conveniently be considered in three
sections:
<P>

(i)	the plot alleged by the plaintiff
<P>

(ii)	the reporting of the plot to the police
<P>

(iii)	the journey to Yagoona
<P>

<b>(i)	The plot alleged by the plaintiff</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>Tape 8 produced to the Enquiry showed the plaintiff on the morning of
Thursday 15 June 1978 giving to his police contact Krawczyk
an account of his
being approached by Anderson quite inconsistent with his later evidence. (Ex A
page 322.7-323.5). There is major
significance in the fact that the account on
the tape accords with Anderson's account in evidence (except for the difference
of one
day, which could easily be explained as a mistake in memory by Anderson
some time after the event), because Anderson's account was
given at a time when
he did not know the contents of the tape. The effect of the plaintiff's account
on the tape being inconsistent
with his evidence at trial is not only to throw
doubt on that evidence. Its concurrence with Anderson's account is extremely
unlikely
to be due to mere coincidence; the strong probability is that the
plaintiff's original account on tape 8 is the truth, and therefore
that his
evidence on this point at trial was false. This also involves his account that
he got the address from a phone book at home
overnight being false. The
improbabilities and illogicalities in his account of the plot (Ex A pages
65-67), and his addition to
his evidence at the second trial of the
synchronisation of watches, obviously untrue (Ex A page 64.3), reinforces
this.
<P>

<b>(ii)	The reporting of the plot to the police</b>
<P>

	The plaintiff's conversation with Senior Constable Krawczyk on tape 9 (Ex A
pp.330-337) from internal evidence alone is not the
spontaneous event which
both parties claim. (The implausible opening, announcing as if for the first
time something already announced
on the phone, the two breaks which could not
conceivably have occurred without the knowledge of both parties, and for which
there
is no rational innocent explanation, the reference in the conversation
after the breaks to matters not referred to previously in
the recording i.e.
"that address", "the test", "the right address" (part of Ex BJ from the
Enquiry). The expert evidence of Mr. Craig
makes it clear that what occurred at
the breaks was not merely stopping and restarting, but rewinding the tape of a
recording which
had originally passed beyond the breaks, and re-recording over
the later material.
<P>

	The plaintiff's evidence at the trial that he was unaware of this conversation
being recorded is clearly false. There is no rational
explanation for stopping
or editing the recording in any way if the conversation were truly spontaneous.
The strong probability is
that the conversation is part of a scheme of
deception.
<P>

	Upon reporting to Mr. Perrin, the plaintiff said that he was to pick up
Alister and Dunn, and afterwards drop them off respectively
at Burwood and
Lewisham (Ex A pp.80-81).  In his record of interview the morning after the
Yagoona expedition, he said, speaking
of the end of the meeting at Queen
Street:
<P>

		"At that point, they gave me no indication as to who I would actually be
transporting and whether or not they would have the device
on their person. As
it turned out, I collected three passengers at the 11.00 p.m. rendezvous. 
<P>

	These people were the three persons who were at the aforesaid meeting, namely
Govinda, Narada and Vishvamitra. I was not to be
told my full getaway routes
until the operation was completed."
<P>

	In tape 9, he said "I can tell you who made the bomb", yet in his record of
interview the next morning, in answer to the question
"Do you have any idea who
manufactured the explosive device?", he replied "No".
<P>

	These clear divergences about central aspects of his account, all within a day
of each other, are the signs of a story evolving
in some respects on the run. A
similar situation occurs with the press releases. The plaintiff gave evidence
that he did not know
to which papers they were addressed. That Mr. Krawczyk had
written their names in his notebook just after the plaintiff left police
headquarters shows that this denial was false.
<P>

<b>(iii)	The journey to Yagoona</b>
<P>

	The plaintiff's account to the police on 22 June 1978, repeated in effect in
evidence at the trial, that Alister and Dunn had confessed
to having done the
Hilton bombing, was plainly learned by heart. There is no other explanation for
the lengthy close similarity with
his journal. See Ex A 268-170, 413-424. He
falsely denied this. His account that on the journey Alister and Dunn resolved
to detonate
the bomb if apprehended, but that he nevertheless kept driving,
though knowing that the police had been alterted, is extremely unlikely.
