<b>10290/93 - COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA v DOVORO PTY. LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>10288/93 - COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA v STONECAT PTY. LIMITED</b>
<P>


<P>

<b>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  The Commonwealth of Australia, ("the
Commonwealth"), the Plaintiff in both of these proceedings, erected at 2/12
Macquarie Street,
Parramatta, premises to house  various Commonwealth
Government departments.  The building was known as The Jessie Street Centre.
It is on the fringe of the Parramatta business district, and was removed from
the main shopping area.  Limited public parking was
available in the vicinity
of this location.
<P>

2  	On the ground floor was constructed an area for occupation as a
cafeteria and restaurant, and a separate area for a drugstore,
pharmacy and
newsagency, as well as other shops.  Although access to the ground floor of the
building is from various doors, the
majority of potential customers for both
areas must enter the Parramatta Commonwealth Offices building through its main
entrance.
<P>

3  	The location of the Parramatta Commonwealth Offices was not in an
area likely to attract passing pedestrian traffic or casual
shopping or trade
in normal business hours.  The Parramatta Mall and  Westfield Shopping Complex
are some short distance from the
Commonwealth Offices, providing retail
banking and service facilities.  The building itself had very limited retail
activities. 
Facilities such as the law courts and nearby offices, but
principally the building's occupants, were the potential main source of
custom.
<P>

4  	A department of the Commonwealth, known as the Australian
Property Group, ("APG"), carried out leasing and property arrangements
on
behalf of the Commonwealth  for the leasing of the Jessie Street Centre.  In
August 1989, APG advertised for tenders to lease
the shop designated as a
newsagency/drug store/general purpose store, being Shop number 6 in the retail
area of the Jessie Street
Centre.  
<P>

5  	On behalf of Stonecat, a consortium of persons who ultimately
became directors of Stonecat submitted to the Commonwealth a tender
for the
lease of the premises, as a result of which APG, on 14 March 1990, granted
approval to proceed with a lease on a base rent
of $140,000 per annum adjusted
annually in accordance with CPI, with additional charges estimated at $35,000
per annum.
<P>

6  	Subsequently, officers of APG advised that approval had been
granted to proceed with a lease, and as a result the consortium
on behalf of
Stonecat entered into possession pursuant to the agreement to lease, without a
formal lease being executed.  On 15 March
1991 Stonecat was advised that
payment of outgoings and rent would commence on 15 April 1991.  
<P>

7  	On 18 December 1992 a notice to quit was served for non-payment
of rent, and a summons for possession of the shop was filed
on 29 January 1993,
on which summons, on 1 May 1995,  Simpson J. granted an adjournment on
Stonecat's application,  on the condition
that Stonecat would consent to an
order for possession.  The premises were vacated on 3 July 1995.
<P>

8  	The Commonwealth, after a series of amended pleadings, sued for
the sum of $273,912.07, being rent and outgoings from 15 April
1991 to 18
January 1993, the expiry of the Notice to Quit, and claimed mesne profits from
February 1993 to July 1995 at a rate of
$14,633.33 per month, being the average
monthly amount due for rent and outgoings during the term of Stonecat's
tenancy, being an
amount of $424,366.57, less payments of $36,000 from the
period 8 March 1993 to 16 February 1995.  The amount therefore owing, as
claimed in the statement of claim, is the sum of $662,278.64.  In addition to
rent and mesne profits the Commonwealth claimed damages,
interest and costs.

<P>

9  	Stonecat eventually brought a cross claim which alleged that the
Commonwealth, through APG, made representations to representatives
of Stonecat
that the total staff at the Jessie Street Centre would be some three thousand
persons, and that there would be approximately
two thousand visitors per
day.
<P>

10  	It was further alleged that the Commonwealth represented the
leased premises could be used as a pharmacy, which would permit
a dispensing of
pharmaceutical products, and further that the Commonwealth would not do
anything to prevent an NHS pharmacy, that
there would be no staff canteens or
vending machines operating in the complex, and that the Commonwealth would
approve or ensure
approval for a dispensing pharmacy with full NHS benefits.

<P>

11  	It was alleged that Stonecat, in reliance on the Commonwealth's
representations, undertook a fitout of the subject premises
costing
approximately $200,000, and entered into the agreement for lease of the
premises.  It was alleged that the Commonwealth's
representations were future
matters, and that the Commonwealth did not have reasonable grounds for making
such representations.
<P>

12  	Stonecat alleged misleading or deceptive conduct on the
Commonwealth's behalf within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP
Act</a>") in that the Commonwealth did not have reasonable grounds for holding the
beliefs on which the representations were made and further
alleged that the
Commonwealth did not have a residential staff of approximately 3,000 as
represented, and that at any particular
time it did not exceed 2,000.  Stonecat
alleged further that the Commonwealth complex did not contain a 400 seat
conference room
as represented.  
<P>

13  	It was further alleged that the rental was not a proper and
reasonable commercial rent, and that the premises could not be
used as a
dispensing pharmacy, and that a staff canteen and vending machines operated
through the complex, and the lessee of the
cafeteria did not have exclusive
rights for the provision of food and associated services.  It was further
alleged by Stonecat that
the Commonwealth would ensure grant of full NHS
benefits for the dispensing pharmacy, notwithstanding an announcement to the
contrary
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nha1953147/" class="autolink_findacts">National Health Act 1953</a>, announced on 6 August 1990, and
that the premises could not in fact be used as a pharmacy with full NHS
benefits. 
<P>

14  	Stonecat claimed loss and damage, being the cost of fitting out
the dispensing pharmacy, and loss of profits that would have
come from the
business if it had included a dispensing pharmacy with full NHS benefits.  It
claimed a setoff against any sum which
the claimant may be entitled to under
the agreement for lease.  Stonecat further claimed relief against forfeiture
under the agreement
for lease.
<P>

15  	Stonecat also sought an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP Act</a>, varying
the agreement to release the cross-claimant from payment of rents other than
the sum of $36,400 per annum, or such other
figure as the court thinks fit, and
further seeks damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.82</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, and damages
generally.  The cross claimant claimed interest including compound interest.
<P>

16  	The Commonwealth admitted in its defence to the cross claim the
representation that the total staff in the Jessie Street Centre
would be 3,000,
but otherwise denied the facts alleged.  The Commonwealth also admitted a
representation that one of the objectives
of the premises was a retail area
providing a comprehensive range of retail services which might include a
dispensing pharmacy, but
denied that it did not have reasonable grounds for
making the representations.
<P>

17  	In relation to the allegation that the Commonwealth would do all
that was reasonably necessary to have a full dispensing NHS
pharmacy, the
Commonwealth contended that it was an implied term of the agreement that the
terms agreed were subject to the laws
of the Commonwealth, and to
administrative acts carried out in the implementation of the policy of the
Commonwealth Government from
time to time.  
<P>

18  	The Commonwealth admitted that an agreement had been entered
into by the relevant Minister and the Pharmacy Guild, which caused
the
determination which prevented the creation of an NHS pharmacy, but revoked this
from 23 January 1991.  The Commonwealth denied
that Stonecat was prevented from
conducting a dispensing pharmacy, but says that a Mr. Peter Marshall, the
proposed pharmacist of
Stonecat, was unable to conduct a dispensing pharmacy as
a consequence of the determination.  The Commonwealth denied breach of any
contract and said there was no basis for any relief against forfeiture.
<P>

19  	As to the other claim, in August 1989 there were discussions
between officers of APG and those negotiating on behalf of Dovoro,
concerning
the tender for the lease of restaurant premises to be known as "The Atrium",
being substantially the same person negotiating
for Stonecat, to provide
restaurant and cafeteria services for the occupants of the building.  An
invitation to tender was issued
to persons ultimately becoming directors of
Dovoro in September 1989, as a result of which a number of meetings took place
with officers
of APG.
<P>

20  	On 16 October 1989 a letter tendering for the lease was
forwarded to APG,  subsequent to which, on 16 November 1989, a tender
was
submitted for lease of the restaurant/cafeteria, which was accepted on 4
January 1990 by APG.  There then followed, during 1990,
a series of discussions
and negotiations concerning the fitting out of the restaurant and alterations
to the cafeteria, and concerning
problems with the liquor licence and fitout.

<P>

21  	In November 1990 Dovoro entered into occupation of  "The
Atrium".  On 15 March 1991 APG advised Dovoro of the date of commencement
of
rent, namely 1 April 1991,  Dovoro having gone into possession on the terms of
the draft lease which had been submitted subject
to variations negotiated by
correspondence.  On 18 December 1992 a notice to quit was issued for
non-payment of rent.  Dovoro vacated
the premises on 30 July 1995.
<P>

22  	The Commonwealth brought proceedings against Dovoro for rent in
pursuance of the lease agreed between the parties from 1 April
1991, from which
date the plaintiff claimed rents and outgoings until 18 January 1993 of
$854,377, and mesne profits from February
1993 to July 1995 at a rate of
$37,500 per month, being the average amount due for rent during the period of
the tenancy, being an
amount of $1,087, 500, making a total of $1,937,877 for
rent and mesne profits, less rent paid from 21 January 1992 to 16 February
1995
of $83,988.37, leaving an amount owing of $1,853,888.63.  The Commonwealth
claimed damages and interest.
<P>

23  	Dovoro pleaded a cross claim that the Commonwealth represented
that the lessee of the cafeteria/restaurant premises would have
exclusive
rights to the provision of food and associated services in the complex, and
that the staff of the premises would be approximately
3,000, with some 2,000
visitors per day, and that there would be anticipated daily sales of at least
$10,000 for the cafeteria; 
that everything would be done to attract patronage,
that the foyer of the complex would be used for concerts, balls and functions
including weddings and formals, that the premises would be able to supply
liquor and that no liquor licence was required,  that there
would be a 400 seat
conference room on the fourth floor, that the rental of the premises at<b>
</b>$300,000 per annum and $120,000 for lease of the kitchen equipment was a
proper and reasonable commercial rent, and that there would
be no staff
canteens or vending machines operating elsewhere in the complex.
<P>

24  	Dovoro undertook renovations and works on the premises of some
$120,000, and entered into the premises pursuant to the agreement
for lease.

<P>

25  	Dovoro alleged against the Commonwealth that the Commonwealth
had engaged in deceptive or misleading conduct, or conduct likely
to deceive in
breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP Act</a> in that it is alleged that the Commonwealth did
not have reasonable grounds for holding the opinions and beliefs that were
asserted,
in that Dovoro was not granted the exclusive rights for provision of
catering, that sales in the cafeteria were not of the order
of $10,000 per day,
and that at no stage did the residential staff approximate 3,000 persons, nor
did it exceed 2,000 persons.  
<P>

26  	It was further alleged that, contrary to the assertion of the
Commonwealth, the foyer centre was not available for concerts,
balls and large
functions including weddings and formals, that approval for sale of liquor was
still required from the New South
Wales Liquor Administration Board, that the
complex did not contain a 400 seat conference room, that rental as proposed was
not a
proper and reasonable commercial rent, and that the Commonwealth had not
received two other tenders offering a rent as high as represented
by it, and
there was a staff canteen and vending machines throughout the complex.  
<P>

27  	It was also alleged that the Commonwealth represented that the
premises would be ready for occupation by March 1990.  It was
alleged that the
Commonwealth had made the above representations falsely and recklessly, as a
result of which Dovoro suffered loss
and damage. 
<P>

28  	The cross claimant further claimed an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP
Act</a> varying the agreement for lease by reducing the rental to 5%, or
alternatively 10%, of the gross turnover of the cross claimant's
business
conducted, or such other rent as the court deems fit.  Dovoro also sought
damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.82</a> of the said Act.  It was alleged by Dovoro that the loss of
profits for the year ending 30 April 1991 to 30 April 1995 due to the
Taxation
office canteen and vending machines, was $490.000.
<P>

29  	The Commonwealth admitted that it had represented there would be
no food retail outlet other than the proposed cafeteria/restaurant,
and
admitted that it had represented the total staff would be 3,000, but otherwise
denied the contentions of Dovoro, and also admitted
that the fitout would be
completed so as to allow occupation by March 1990, and otherwise denied the
facts alleged.
<P>

30  	The Commonwealth further admitted that it represented to Dovoro
that the foyer was suitable for functions, and that it would
be available for
hire on request, but otherwise denied the facts as alleged.  The Commonwealth
admitted that it expected wine and
beer to be served, but otherwise denied the
facts alleged.  The Commonwealth admits that it represented that the market
value of
the restaurant was some $300,000, but otherwise denied the facts
alleged, but disputed Dovoro's entitlement to damages or relief
against
forfeiture.
<P>

31  	Both actions were heard together, and the evidence in one matter
was evidence in the other.  Obviously some evidence, particularly
as to
damages, would relate to one or other action only, but most of the evidence was
common.
<P>

32  	In accordance with the pleadings, Mr Murr on behalf of the
Commonwealth conceded that the existence of an Australian Taxation
Office
("ATO") was at variance with the representation made by the Commonwealth that
no other retail food outlet would be on the
premises, and it was conceded that
the existence of the canteen had an adverse effect on the trading of Dovoro.
It is conceded that
it was a representation that did not come to fruition, and
that it cost Dovoro money.  The Commonwealth said that its expert evidence
said
that the amount was of the order of $50,000 per annum.
<P>

33  	Mr Murr conceded that as to the second major alleged
misrepresentation that there were to be some 3,000 public servants working
in
the building, that that in fact had been represented, but it was not conceded
that the figure of approximately 3,000 fulltime
staff was wrong.  Mr Wilson for
the defendants did not accept that there were only two misrepresentations,
although it was not proposed
to rely on all of the assertions set out in the
pleadings.
<P>

34  	The proceedings were conducted on the basis of a large number of
affidavits filed by all parties to the proceedings, and by
the tender of
documents produced on subpoena.  There was then oral evidence given by
witnesses who had sworn affidavits or given
a statement.
<P>

35  	The restaurant the subject of the lease to Dovoro had access
from the building, but the building was secured at 6 o'clock at
night.  It also
had external access after that hour from the adjoining street.  It was
necessary for occupants of the building to
actually leave the building in
Macquarie Street and walk round into O'Connell Street to access the restaurant.
It was an agreed condition
of the use of the restaurant that public servants
would have the right to bring in their own food and consume it within the
cafeteria
area, free of charge, and in fact a number did so throughout the
period of the lessee's occupation.
<P>

36  	A considerable part of the affidavit evidence and the oral
evidence in the hearing related to a series of conversations which
had occurred
from the time of the awarding of the tender to each consortium, and the
commencement of the business by Stonecat and
Dovoro respectively.  Those
conversations occurred between the various combinations of parties, both at the
APG offices at Chatswood
and on the Jessie Street site.  
<P>

37  	Involved in the discussions was Mr Peter Hampson, who was the
Director of Development of APG.  He was at the time of the hearing
retired for
some years.  Responsible to him was a Mr Ron Mead, the Supervisor of the person
responsible for much of the negotiations,
Mr Phillip Beggs.  One of the
meetings involved Mr Arthur Gallery, the State head of APG.  Negotiations on
behalf of Stonecat and
Dovoro involved Directors of that company, Mr Barry
William Brown, Mr Michael Berger and Mr Paul Berger.
<P>

38  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP Act</a> prohibits conduct that is misleading or
deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, and provides that where a
representation is made
and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for
making it, it shall be taken to be misleading, and in relation to a
representation
as to a future matter, the corporation shall, unless it produces
evidence to the contrary, be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds
for
making the representation.  
<P>

39  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP Act</a> provides that a person who suffers loss or damage as
a result of misleading or deceptive conduct may recover such damage against
a
person involved in that conduct.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">TP Act</a> provides that the
court may make an order which the court considers appropriate against a person
who is engaged in a contravention
of certain parts of the Act, including breach
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a>, to compensate for loss or damage.
<P>

40  	There has been no issue in these proceedings concerning the
coming into effect of the lease on the basis of the submitted agreement
to
lease, as varied by correspondence in respect of each premises.  The lease at
common law came into effect from the taking of possession.
 Both parties seem
to have accepted that there would be a rent holiday until a stipulated date,
and there has been no challenge to
the fact that rent became payable under the
lease in accordance with the draft lease submitted from the nominated date by
the Commonwealth,
subject to the rent holiday.  The lease then by virtue of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.127</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> became a tenancy at will, terminable on one
month's notice.
<P>

41  	I wish to now set out an examination of the various issues
raised in the cross-claims by Stonecat and Dovoro.  These are not
ranked in
order of importance.

<P>

42  	It is clear from the evidence of all relevant witnesses that
there were discussions which involved talk of a 400 seat conference
facility.
I do not accept that this was a formal representation made by the
representatives of the Commonwealth.  I do not accept
the evidence on behalf of
Dovoro which asserts that it was proposed that a conference facility would be
installed.  I accept the
version of Mr Beggs at p.197 of the transcript:
<P>

"...we propose to install a conference facility on the fourth floor.  This is
words to the effect that this is not set in concrete
as yet, because we are
going to undertake a feasibility study to see what patronage we could expect,
and to see whether we had enough
money to actually build this facility."  
<P>

There was therefore no representation that this conference centre would be
carried out at any time.  I accept that such a suggestion
is a matter which a
proposed lessee would take into account as a possibility, but there being no
assertion that the conference centre
would occur, Dovoro was not entitled to
rely on this as a representation.
<P>

<b>Liquor Licence:</b>  
<P>

43  	It is clear that the Commonwealth representatives were of the
view, and represented to Dovoro, that it was not necessary for
there to be
State law approval for the creation of a facility for the retailing of alcohol.
 Dovoro clearly relied on this.  The
legal advice that was ultimately accepted
was however that the State could in fact regulate the premises as though they
were premises
covered by State law, but that the State could not charge a
licensing fee.  The evidence, which was uncontested, was that the Managers
of
the restaurant premises did  in fact supply liquor, and were not restricted in
this respect, even though they did not advertise
liquor as being available.
There is in fact no restriction or detriment which Dovoro suffered, since they
were in fact supplying
liquor as the Commonwealth represented that they
could.
<P>

<b>Sole Distributor of Food through the Jessie Street Complex:</b>
<P>

44  	There is no contest on the evidence between the parties, and it
is admitted in the course of the hearing, that it was represented
by the
Commonwealth that the canteen restaurant would be the sole provider of food,
except insofar as there was a food outlet contained
within the Stonecat
drugstore/newsagency for certain lines of prepackaged foods and normal articles
found in a drugstore/newsagency.
<P>

45  	The Taxation Department, being the major tenant of the premises,
had always operated at its previous address and in other locations
a staff
canteen, the proceeds of which went towards a Christmas club.  There were also
a number of vending machines in the various
Government departments.
<P>

46  	These had been operating prior to Dovoro entering into the
premises, but were the subject of discussions in April 1991, at
about the time
that the rent was to commence well after the date of commencement of
obligations under the lease.
<P>

47  	Mr. Arthur Gallery, the State Manager, indicated that it was
desirable that arrangements should be made for the staff canteen
to be
discontinued and the vending machines removed.  The Directors of Dovoro
realised however that an imposed solution such as the
closing of the canteen
would result in disaffection on the part of the employees of the Australian Tax
Office, being the principal
occupant of the building.  It was clear that there
may be resentment and even black bans on the restaurant if the staff of the
Taxation
Department considered that it was the restaurant that had forced the
closure of the staff canteen.  
<P>

48  	As I have set out earlier, the Commonwealth has conceded that
the existence of the canteen probably had an adverse effect on
the trading of
Dovoro in the restaurant.  It is on the evidence abundantly clear that the
presence of the canteen, and its peculiar
circumstances as a staff canteen,
seriously affected the potential income of Dovoro, as did the vending machines.
It is not just
the profit of the canteen and the vending machines that needs to
be taken into account in assessing this loss, it is the fact that
people who
come to use a restaurant are more likely to return to it, and people who come
for instance to buy coffee will often on
impulse also buy something to eat.
The detriment to the restaurant, and therefore Dovoro, is in fact considerably
more than merely
the profit earned by the canteen.
<P>

49  	I consider that the representation as to the exclusive food
provision being for the benefit of Dovoro was made recklessly,
that it was
relied upon by Dovoro, and that Dovoro suffered loss as a result of such
reliance.
<P>

<b>Delay in Completion:</b>
<P>

50  	I am satisfied on the evidence, which does not appear to be in
contest, that representations were made that the building would
be completed in
early 1990, and that it was in fact not available to Dovoro until about October
1990.  However, Dovoro has not demonstrated
on the evidence before me that it
did any act in reliance on such representation, or that it suffered any damage
as a result of it
independent of the other heads of damage.
<P>

<b>Number of Building Occupiers:</b>
<P>

51  	The evidence, particularly that of Michael Berger, was that he
had assumed that the figure asserted by the Commonwealth of
3,000 employees was
a "ball park figure", and that it would be somewhere between 2,800 and 3,000.
It is clear however that the Commonwealth
concedes 3,000 as the number that it
represented, and it is also clear that Dovoro relied in general terms on that
representation.
<P>

52  	The evidence before me discloses that during the period before
the expiry of the notice to quit the numbers were somewhere
between 2,100 and
2,200.  Subsequently the removal of the Penrith Tax Office took out some 700
employees, but this was a matter not
within the knowledge of the Commonwealth
at the time the representations were made.  The reduction in potential
occupiers of the
building to use the restaurant was of the order of 25%.  That
reduction obviously however had an even greater impact on restaurant
usage,
since most of a restaurant's costs are fixed, and employees cost the same
whether they are working or not, and food and fixtures
and other outgoings are
not all proportionate to the number of users.  The loss therefore of an
additional third again of users on
top of the number in fact available would
have a very much higher impact on turnover of the restaurant.  Dovoro clearly
suffered
significant damage as a result of this.
<P>

<b>Use of The Atrium:</b>
<P>

53  	As part of the discussions leading up to the tender, I accept
the evidence of the Dovoro Directors, which is not substantially
disputed, that
it had been suggested that The Atrium in the centre of the complex would be
available for functions and weddings.
 The evidence of the Dovoro Directors was
that there may have been one or two occasions when use of The Atrium was
sought, and permission
was refused.  This has not been shown to be a
significant part of the trading results of Dovoro.  The restaurant itself was
used
for special functions on a large number of occasions, sometimes for
Taxation Department employees.  I do not consider that there
has been shown to
be a formal representation that The Atrium would be available, the
Commonwealth's officers indicating that it would
be a matter for permission to
be sought from the Building Manager.
<P>

<b>Number of Meals:</b>
<P>

54  	There was considerable contest between the parties about the
assertion on behalf of the Dovoro Directors that a document was
photostated and
made available to them to the effect that the Commonwealth officers estimated
that there would be some 1,000 meals
per day at $10 per meal.  The officers of
the Commonwealth asserted that no such document was made available, and
produced a document
which I accept was that which was provided to the Dovoro
Directors.  This document was not compatible with that asserted by Dovoro's
directors.
<P>

55  	In any event, the evidence of the Dovoro Directors was that they
had carried out their own calculations, and on their own estimates
the
Commonwealth figures were conservative, and it is clear on the evidence that
Dovoro's officers were capable of making their own
calculations of the likely
use of the restaurant/cafeteria.  I accept the evidence of Mr Ronald Bruce Mead
at p 152 of the transcript:
<P>

"Q.  In your affidavit at paragraph 7 you say that Mr Hampson had a copy of
this document and had referred to it?
<P>

                A.  Correct.
<P>

  	      Q.  What did he say about it?
<P>

A.  From memory it was words to the effect that `this document has been
prepared and you may be able to use it, it may be of some
assistance in
preparing your tender, but you will have to do your own sums', or words to that
effect."
<P>

I consider that the document made available was as asserted by the officers of
the Commonwealth, and that in any event Dovoro relied
on its own estimates,
which they considered to be "conservative".  No representation was made and
there was no reliance proven in
any event.
<P>

<b>Numbers of Visitors:</b>
<P>

56  	Although there was an assertion on the part of the officers of
Dovoro that a representation was made that there would be 2,000
visitors per
day, I accept the evidence of Mead and Beggs that no such representation was
made, although there may have been discussion
on the issue.
<P>

<b>Representation that Dovoro should pay $300,000 for rental of the premises:
</b>
<P>

57  	It was contended by Dovoro that because of the superior position
of the Commonwealth, and the nature of the negotiations, that
it was not
unreasonable for Dovoro's representatives to have assumed that the $300,000 was
a proper valuation of the rental of the
premises for use as a
cafeteria/restaurant.
<P>

58  	The evidence discloses that the officers of Dovoro were
experienced at restaurant management and financial matters, Mr Michael
Berger
being particularly so qualified, and it was clear that they were prepared to
allow a higher percentage for rent in their estimates
than would be normal.  I
accept that Dovoro was told that $300,000 was necessary to secure the tender,
but I do not accept this as
a representation that the rent was represented as
being a fair and reasonable rent.  This was a normal commercial transaction by
way of tender, to some extent at arm's length.  The proposed lessee was capable
of making its own assessment, and I do not accept
that a representation as to
the proper level of rent was made by the Commonwealth, as alleged, such that
Dovoro's officers relied
on it in deciding on the rent that they were prepared
to pay.  Dovoro's officers clearly made their own calculations and tendered
accordingly.
<P>

<b>The Stonecat NHS Dispensing Facility:</b>
<P>

59  	On 8 August 1990 the Commonwealth Government announced a change
of National Health policy in relation to NHS dispensing pharmacies,
to the
effect that no further NHS pharmacies would be permitted within five kilometres
of existing NHS pharmacies, and on certain
other conditions.  The Commonwealth
provided transitional provisions for arrangements that were already in place,
but with these
the Stonecat pharmacy was unable to comply.  
<P>

60  	Stonecat was free to have a pharmacy without such benefits, but
medication would have to be purchased at full price, which
would make it
unlikely to attract customers of the volume that an NHS pharmacy would do.  
<P>

61  	I do not consider, notwithstanding that the APG officers clearly
wanted an NHS dispensing pharmacy, and that to lose that capacity
would
severely affect the income and customer drawing capacity of a pharmacy, that in
fact any representation was made that the Commonwealth
would succeed in having
the Stonecat pharmacy exempted.  
<P>

62  	At page 100 to page 101 the following evidence occurred:
<P>

"Q.  See if you can recall Mr Beggs saying anything to this effect, `We can
take this up with the Department of Health in Canberra",
and then he referred
to the names of two people and continued, `I will contact them and see if it is
possible to have this particular
pharmacy exempted on the basis that after all
it is a government building and the tenders had already been let for the
establishment
of a pharmacy before the government announced the new
legislation".  Do you recall Mr Beggs saying words to that effect at any
meetings
you attended?  It is quite important, I am putting to you a
conversation that someone has said has taken place.  I want to ask you
first of
all whether you recall being at a meeting where either those words or words
similar to those words were said?
<P>

                A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  The second part of this question is do you agree that Mr Beggs said words
to the effect that I have read out to you?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q. Can I put some more conversation to you and see if you can recall first of
all being at a meeting where words to this effect
were said and what your
recollection of the relevant conversation was.  Mr Brown saying these words,
`What progress is being made
with the Department of Health to overcome the
problems we are experiencing with the establishment of a pharmacy'.  Mr Beggs
saying
these words, `We are still having discussions with the Department of
Health.  I am confident that one governmeent department can
work with another
to overcome these problems'.  First of all do you recall words to that effect
being said in your presence?
<P>

A.  On many occasions.
<P>

Q.  and do you accept that that is an accurate or sufficiently accurate version
of what was said?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  You would agree with me, wouldn't you, that in the course of your
negotiations in relation to Stonecat it was never represented
to you or to
anyone to your knowledge that National Health Service benefits would be
available in the pharmacy?
<P>

A.  No, that's not true.  We were alway promised that we would have those
benefits available.
<P>

Q.  You were always promised that?
<P>

A.  That was the understanding of Phil Beggs.
<P>

Q.  Let me put the question again, the question wasn't what the understanding
was or what you thought it was or what you thought
was going to happen.  The
question was nobody said to you that National Health Service benefits would be
available?
<P>

A.  Yes they did, I was told that.
<P>

Q.  Who told you that and when?
<P>

A.  I would say on several occasions, Mr Hampson and Mr Beggs.  I think at one
stage Mr Hampson was going to the Minister in Canberra
to get it pushed
through."
<P>

63  	I accept that the officers of Stonecat believed that it would be
possible for an NHS pharmacy to be brought into being, but
the evidence does
not support the fact that a representation was made that the officers of the
APG would succeed in it.  In this
respect I refer to the evidence of Mr. Paul
Berger at page 120 of the transcript:
<P>

"Q.  I will repeat that last sentence.  Mr Hampson replied, `Does that mean you
won't be putting the pharmacy in?'.  Mr Brown said,
`No, our desire is still to
proceed but obviously we are going to need assistance to overcome this latest
government legislation'.
 Mr Beggs said, `We can take this up with the
Department of Health in Canberra', do you recall that being said?
<P>

A.  Yes, that could be part of it.
<P>

Q.  Could be part of it?
<P>

A.  I could have heard that."
<P>

64  	Mr Beggs at transcript page 217 confirmed that attempts were
made to persuade the Commonwealth to exempt The Atrium drugstore,
but no
representation had been made at the time that the lease came into existence in
late 1990 that the Commonwealth would succeed
in securing an NHS dispensing
capacity..
<P>

<b>Submissions of the Parties on Quantum:</b>
<P>

65  	The Commonwealth claimed only the equivalent of rent at the
contractual rate for the period that Dovoro was in occupation,
and not for the
loss of the benefit of its bargain.
<P>

66  	I accept that the Commonwealth is entitled to recover, as
submitted, subject to what is provided below on the cross-claims,
that as the
figure for mesne profits is less than rent at the contractual rate, the
Commonwealth is entitled to the difference in
damages for repudiation of the
agreement to lease.
<P>

67  	As to Dovoro's claim against the Commonwealth, the correct
measure of damages is the difference edthat Dovoro did not proved
what the true
rental value would have been.
<P>

68  	The Commonwealth says in relation to Stonecat that the only
representation relied on relates to the NHS pharmacy, and that
there is no
reliable evidence as to damages, and says in relation to staff and visitor
numbers that the expert called by the Commonwealth,
Borthwick, reconstructed
the evidence of Cheadle, the Stonecat expert, and arrived at a figure of
$5,901.
<P>

69  	In relation to damages the submission of Mr Wilson is that
Stonecat, as a result of the loss of business for the reduction
in number of
occupants of the building, is entitled to claim one-half of the sum in Exhibit
11 of $111,424 for cost of installationless
cost of cash registers, vacuum,
safe and other common items, and therefore claims $53,155, being half of the
balance expended.  I
consider that this is not correct basis for apportioning
the allocated costs, but consider that some part of the cost of fitting
out is
a sum for which Stonecat should be compensated on the basis of the
representation as to the numbers of building occupants,
and consider that the
sum of $25,000 is an appropriate award of damages to Stonecat. 
<P>

70  	Mr Cheadle, the expert for Stonecat, calculates loss of revenue
as a result of reliance on staff number representation at a
total of $104,280,
in his affidavit of 30 November 1995.  I consider that this figure, taking into
account the different assumptions
made by each of the experts, is very close to
a proper sum reflecting revenue loss, and I therefore allow $100,000 as a
result of
Dovoro's reliance on staff number representation.  
<P>

71  	I do not accept that Stonecat has shown that it relied on
representation of the Commonwealth as to what was a proper rent,
but I do
consider, leaving aside the issue of the NHS pharmacy, that the significant
reduction in numbers of the Commonwealth public
servants occupying the building
is an appropriate matter for the exercise of the Court's powers under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87</a> on
the basis of a contravention of the Act.  I think it is therefore appropriate,
since the reduction in numbers of users of the
drugstore is approximately
one-quarter of the total sum represented, but the costs of running a drugstore
would be proportionately
higher on the smaller turnover.  It seems to me
therefore that for the period of lease and occupation from after the cooling
period,
that from 1 April 1991 to the vacating of the premises, that the rent
should be reduced by $40,000 per annum, resulting in a rent
of $100,000 in lieu
of the $140,000 charged.
<P>

<b>Damages of Dovoro:</b>
<P>

72  	I accept the submission of Mr Wilson on behalf of Dovoro that
Dovoro has suffered loss or damage by contravention of the Commonwealth
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a>
of the TPA and that an order should be made against the Commonwealth reducing
the rent payable.  I have indicated above that I consider
that the fact that
there is a 25% reduction in the number of persons potentially using the
cafeteria/restaurant should not be reflected
in a directly proportional
reduction in the rent, as I consider that the cost effectiveness of the
premises are significantly reduced
by the reduction in turnover.  The evidence
was that at no stage was the cafeteria/restaurant much more than 50% utilised.
The loss
of trading custom and profits, and the assessment of a proper rental
if it had been known that the Tax Office would continue to have
its own
canteen, and the fact that there were other vending machines in the building,
would have significantly altered the basis
upon which the rent should have been
calculated.
<P>

73  	I consider that an appropriate order which the Court should make
as a result of the conduct of the Commonwealth relied on,
taking into account
that the rent is split into an amount for plant and equipment hire and an
amount for rent in addition to other
outgoings, is a reduction of the fixed
rent component of $300,000 to an amount of $150,000 from 1 April 1991 to the
termination of
the occupancy of Dovoro that this figure should be taken from
the rent and mesne profits claimed.
<P>

<b>Claim for Damages:</b>
<P>

74  	I accept the submission that in relation to the representation
as to the number of public servants, and that Dovoro would have
an exclusive
food and beverage provision, that a breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> of the TPA has been
established.  It appears to me in terms of the decisions cited by the counsel
for Dovoro,  <i>Sellara v Adelaide Petroleum <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20120%20ALR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 120 ALR 16</a>, </i>that the
misrepresentations can be linked to a significant loss of profits in the
carrying on of the trading enterprise.  I further
accept that in applying
<i>Finucane v NSW Egg Corporation (1988) AdLAR 486 at 519,</i> that damages
should be assessed as actual damages, and that there is no discretionary
component within that assessment.
<P>

75  	I accept the submission of Mr Wilson for Dovoro that Dovoro had
sunk sufficient time, energy and cost into the carrying of
the trading
enterprise, on the assumption that the representations would be made out, and
that it had no choice other than to remain
in possession after termination of
the agreement for lease.
<P>

76  	It is submitted by Dovoro that Mr Cheadle, its expert's, figures
result in additional sales varying between $125,664 and $194,734
in the period
30 April 1991 to 30 April 1995.  Mr Cheadle calculates gross profits for the
year ending 30 April 1992 at $107,103,
for the following year $102,888, for the
following $103,211, and the year ending 30 April 1995 at $97,692.  I consider
the sum of
$400,000, taking into account the various assumptions made, as a
figure for loss of profits for the period of the lease, and I accept
Mr
Cheadle's view that there is no increase in variable costs as a result of the
additional scales, or that such sum is relatively
slight.
<P>

77  	As some calculations need be done, I would prefer to leave it to
the parties to calculate the amounts payable in respect of
each cross-claim and
in respect of the original claim.  Interest will need to be calculated on the
figures, and further submissions
as to costs.
<P>

<b>The orders that I propose therefore are:</b>
<P>

1.	Subject to the compensatory orders hereunder made on the cross-action,
verdict for the plaintiff in each claim in respect of
the amounts set out in
the statement of claim.
<P>

2. 	On the Dovoro cross-action, that the rent payable under the lease to Dovoro
be reduced by the sum of $150,000 per annum.
<P>

3.	That the plaintiff pay damages to Dovoro in the sum of $400,000 as set out
above.
<P>

4.	On the Stonecat cross action, that the rent in the lease to Stonecat be
varied by a reduction of $40,000 per annum in respect
of the period from
commencement of the lease on 1 April 1991 to termination of occupancy.
<P>

5.	On the Stonecat Cross-action, that the Commonwealth pay damages to Stonecat
in the sum of $25,000.
<P>

6.	On the Stonecat cross-action, that the Commonwealth compensate Stonecat for
revenue lost in terms of staff number representation
in the sum of $100,000.
<P>

7.	That the parties have liberty to apply to submit orders based on calculation
of damages above.
<P>

8.	That interest calculation be reserved.
<P>

9.	Costs reserved.
