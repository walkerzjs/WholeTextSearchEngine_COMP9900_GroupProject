<b><u>12238/99 - Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)  v Anthony
West</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	By the amended summons filed in these proceedings, the
Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), as plaintiff, appeals pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s104.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 104</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a></i> against an order of the Burwood Local Court
dismissing informations laid against the defendant, Anthony West.  Such an
appeal is
confined to questions of law.
<P>

2   	Relevantly, pleas of not guilty were entered on 27 April
1999 and the informations were adjourned to 21 May 1999.  The prosecution
brief
was delivered to the defendant's legal representatives on 10 May 1999, that
being less than 14 days before 21 May 1999.  On
21 May 1999, the proceedings
were marked "not reached" and adjourned to 27 July 1999.  On that date, the
court ruled that because
of late service of the prosecution brief the
prosecution was precluded from adducing evidence.  The informations were
accordingly
dismissed.
<P>

3   	The legislative context is as follows.  By the <i>Justices
Amendment</i> <i>(Briefs</i> <i>of Evidence) Act 1997</i>, subdivision 6A was
introduced into Div 2 of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a></i>.  So far as is presently
relevant the new sections were as follows:
<P>

<b>"66B.	 Brief of evidence to be served on defendant unless otherwise
ordered</b>
<P>

(1)	If a defendant pleads not guilty to a prescribed summary offence being
prosecuted by a prosecuting authority, the prosecuting
authority must, unless
the Justice or Justices otherwise order in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66E</a>, serve
or cause to be served on the defendant a copy of the brief of evidence relating
to the offence.
<P>

(2)	The copy of the brief of evidence is to be served at least 14 days before
the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution unless
the defendant consents
to a shorter period or, in the opinion of the Justice or Justices, the
circumstances of the case otherwise
require.
<P>

<b>66E	Discretion to order that copy of brief of evidence need not be
served.</b>
<P>

(1)	The Justice or Justices may order that all or part of the copy of the brief
of evidence need not be served if the Justice or
Justices are satisfied.
<P>

(a)	that there are compelling reasons for not requiring service, or
<P>

(b)	that it could not reasonably be served on the defendant.
<P>

(2)	The Justice or Justices may make an order under this section on their own
initiative or on the application of any party.
<P>

(3)	An order may be made subject to such conditions (if any) as the Justice or
Justices think fit.
<P>

<b>66F Evidence not to be admitted</b>
<P>

(1)	 The Justice or Justices are to refuse to admit evidence sought to be
adduced by the prosecuting authority in respect of the
prescribed summary
offence if, in relation to that evidence, this Subdivision, or any regulations
made for the purposes of this Subdivision,
have not been complied with by the
prosecuting authority.
<P>

(2)	The Justice or Justices may, and on the application of or with the consent
of the defendant must, dispense with the requirements
of subsection (1) on such
terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable.
<P>

(3)	 Subsection (2) does not apply to any requirement referred to in subsection
(1) that is declared by the regulations to be a
requirement that may not be
dispensed with under subsection (2).
<P>

<b>66G	 Adjournments</b>
<P>

Without limiting the power of a Justice or Justices to adjourn proceedings, the
Justice or Justices are to grant such adjournments
as appear to be just and
reasonable if the copy of the brief of evidence is not served in accordance
with this Subdivision, and may
extend accordingly the time for hearing the
matter."
<P>

4   	It is common ground that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B</a> applied in the present case.
The objectives of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B</a> are obvious enough and are confirmed by the second
reading speeches in the parliament:  first, to further the just and efficient
conduct of trials by advance notice of the prosecution evidence; and, secondly,
to provide an adequate opportunity before trial for
informed reconsideration of
the decision to plead not guilty.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66F(1)</a> prescribes the sanction for
non-compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B.</a>  Other  provisions introduce flexibility to guard
against <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(1)</a> operating unjustly to the prosecuting authority,
without injustice to the defendant.
<P>

5   	When read as coherent scheme, designed to serve the
purposes to which I have referred, the sections are to be construed as
follows.
<P>

(a)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66E</a> is designed to operate prospectively.  The language is not apt
for retrospective relief against non-compliance.  The time for operation
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
66E</a> is before the date on which the brief is required to be served.
<P>

(b)	The time for operation of the sanction prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(1)</a> is when
evidence is sought to be adduced by the prosecution.  If, at that time, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
66F(1)</a> has not been complied with, the prosecuting authority is precluded from
adducing evidence, unless the obligation of compliance has
been or is then
dispensed with or relevantly modified.
<P>

(c)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66F(2)</a> speaks of the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(1).</a>  That is the
requirement to refuse to admit the prosecution evidence on the particular
occasion if there has been non-compliance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B</a> and no relieving order has
been made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66E</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(2).</a>  The time for operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(2)</a> is at or
before the occasion on which the prosecution evidence is sought to be
tendered.
<P>

(d)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66G</a> empowers the court to adjourn the proceedings where there has
been non-compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B.</a>  The time for operation of this section is the
same as for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(2).</a>  The purpose and effect of an adjournment pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
66G</a> is to postpone the time when the prosecution evidence is sought to be
adduced or will be sought to be adduced to an occasion when
there will have
been compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B.</a>
<P>

6   	It follows that, in the ordinary case, these sections are
designed to operate as follows:
<P>

(i)	On the occasion when a plea of not guilty is entered, the magistrate may,
on his own initiative or on the application of a party,
order that all or part
of the brief need not be served <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 66E).</a>
<P>

(ii)	On the same occasion, the court may shorten the 14 days referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
66B(2)</a> (s <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">66B</a>(2)).
<P>

(iii)	The prosecution then serves the brief at least 14 days before the trial
fixture or within any abridged time <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 66B(2)).</a>
<P>

(iv)	On the occasion fixed for the trial, the magistrate may, or on the
application or with the consent of the defendant must, on
such terms and
conditions as are just and reasonable, dispense with the requirement in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
66F(1)</a>; that is, the requirement to refuse to admit evidence sought to be
adduced by the prosecution if the brief has not been served as
required <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
66F(2)).</a>
<P>

(v)	Alternatively, the magistrate may adjourn the proceedings thereby providing
(if the brief has not been served) or enlarging
(if the brief has been served
late) the time for consideration of the brief <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 66G).</a>
<P>

(vi)	If the obligation to serve a brief pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B</a> has not then been
dispensed with by an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66E</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(2)</a> and an adjournment has not
been granted under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a>, and if there is then seen to be non-compliance with
that obligation (as may have been modified by an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66E</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F)</a>,
the magistrate must (<i>on application by the defendant?</i>) refuse to admit
evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 66F(1))</a>, and the
information will necessarily be dismissed.
<P>

7   	I have left open whether, in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(1)</a>, the
magistrate is required to refuse to admit the evidence irrespective of whether
an application is made to that effect by the
defendant.  I am strongly inclined
to think that there is no obligation on the magistrate to give consideration to
orders under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66E</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(1)</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> of his or her own motion.  (There is
express power to do so under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66E</a>, but that does not imply an obligation.
Application of the principle of expressio unius suggests that there is not even
the power
to act of the court's own motion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(2)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G.</a>  Under our
adversarial system, the courts do not perform an investigative function.  It
would be a strange thing if a magistrate
were held accountable for error in
failing to investigate whether there were grounds for such an order, or for
failing to make such
an order on whatever materials may have fortuitously come
into his or her hands without the assistance of a moving party.
<P>

8   	In the present case, the matter was listed for hearing on
21 May 1999 and adjourned "not reached".  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66F(1)</a> did not operate on
that occasion because evidence was not sought to be adduced by the prosecution.
The proceedings were adjourned
to 27 July 1999.  On that occasion, the
prosecution sought to adduce evidence.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66F(1)</a> operated then if there
was non-compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B.</a>  But there was compliance with that section.
The brief had been delivered on 10 May 1999, more than 14 days before 27 July
1999.
 That was the relevant occasion on which the prosecution sought to adduce
evidence, indeed the only occasion in this case when the
prosecution sought to
adduce evidence.
<P>

9   	The learned magistrate was constrained by the decision of
this court in <i>DPP v Milgate </i> (Sully J,  19  February 1999,  unreported)
to hold  that  
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66F(1)</a> operated as at 21 May 1999 when the matter was first listed for
hearing, with the result that he was bound to refuse to admit evidence
sought
to be adduced by the prosecution on 27 July 1999, notwithstanding that on the
latter occasion the brief had been served more
than fourteen days previously.
That approach does not accord with the construction of the sections I have
propounded.  In<i> Milgate</i>, Sully J propounded a construction of the
relevant sections which is very different from my own.  In my view, the learned
magistrate
should have held there was compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66B</a> and should not have
refused to admit the prosecution evidence.
<P>

10   	In my opinion, the following orders should be made:
<P>

(1)	Appeal allowed.
<P>

(2)	Order dismissing the informations for the offence of resisting a police
officer in the execution of his duty and for two offences
of assaulting a
police officer quashed.
<P>

(3)	The proceedings be remitted to the Local Court for determination according
to law.
<P>

11   	It is unsatisfactory for the Local Court to be confronted
with conflicting decisions on such a matter.  The daily workings
of those
courts are affected.  Accordingly, the present proceedings should be referred
to the Court of Appeal to settle the correct
construction of these
provisions.
<P>

12   	The orders I make are as follows:
<P>

(1)	Proceedings removed into the Court of Appeal.
<P>

(2)	Reserve the costs of the hearing before me.
