CRIMINAL DIVISION
<P>

No. 70081 of 1996
<P>

GREG JAMES, J.
<P>

TUESDAY 16 FEBRUARY 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. DAVID SAMUEL BARAC</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	On 3 August 1998, the prisoner, David Samuel Barac, pleaded guilty before me
to a charge that he, on or about 3 April 1995 near
Goulburn in the State of New
South Wales, did murder Helen Cusack.  The deceased was his wife.
<P>

2	At the time of the killing, the prisoner and his wife had been married a
little over two months.  The relationship had ruptured
and objectively,
reconciliation seemed improbable.  The deceased was the prisoner's second wife,
the first marriage having also broken
down resulting in the events I will refer
to later.
<P>

3	By his plea, not only did the prisoner admit the voluntary killing of the
deceased and an intention to kill or do really serious
injury to her which
injury occasioned her death, but also that the killing occurred in New South
Wales.  This last matter was a matter
of some little importance since, in the
absence of that admission, an issue might well have arisen as to the place of
death and the
applicability of s.3A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> (1900).
<P>

4	The plea was entered at the very eve of trial and indeed after the matter had
been listed for pre-trial applications to precede
the empanelling of a jury on
10 August 1998.  The trial that would have ensued in the absence of such a
plea, I was informed, could
have been expected to take some five weeks.  (I
have taken these matters into account for the purposes of s.439 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act</a> (1900).  In the context of the sentence I have determined I should pass and
the matters regarding contrition and rehabilitation I
refer to below, I regard
the plea, notwithstanding the case against the prisoner was very strong, as of
some, but limited significance,
primarily for its pragmatic value in avoiding a
trial, and have as required by the section, reduced the sentence to the
requisite
extent.)
<P>

5	Thereafter the matter came before me for sentence but in the circumstances
referred to in my judgment of 23 October 1998, the
matter was stood over to
enable material to be obtained for presentation on the plea by the prisoner.
On 23 October, the Crown Prosecutor
provided me with a bundle of victim impact
statements which I received as set out in the judgment I delivered that day in
respect
of those statements and which I have treated as I am required to in
accordance with s.23C of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act</a> (1986).
<P>

6	There had been considerable doubt about the appropriate trial jurisdiction
arising from the lack, originally, of sufficient evidence
to identify precisely
the location of the killing as in New South Wales rather than the ACT.  The
prisoner had been charged with
the murder on 2 May 1995 in the Australian
Capital Territory pursuant to a first instance warrant for murder issued there.
On 26
October 1995 at Lithgow Police Station, he was charged with the murder
under s.19A of the New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.  On 21 October 1996, the
prisoner was committed for trial to the Supreme Court of New South Wales
following a committal of some
13 hearing days.  On 26 May 1997, the prisoner
finished serving a sentence of four and a half years imprisonment that had been
imposed
upon him on 22 September 1992 for the malicious wounding with intent of
his first wife which sentence had comprised a minimum term
of two years and an
additional term expiring on 26 May 1997.  The prisoner had been returned to
custody to serve out that minimum
term for breaches of parole shortly after his
wife's death.  He has therefore been in custody since 26 May 1997 for a period
solely
referrable to this charge.  His sentence should therefore date from that
date.
<P>

7	Following his release at the conclusion of that minimum term of imprisonment
on 21 September 1994 the prisoner had commenced to
live with the deceased in
Sydney.  They had met in 1993 when the deceased then 23 years of age, was
employed by the Correctional
Centre's Educational Department as a librarian and
whilst the prisoner was in custody.  The relationship was therefore of
comparatively
short duration.
<P>

8	The background to this charge is set out in a statement of facts which has
been admitted into evidence and from which I quote:-
<P>

	"In early March 1995 the prisoner and the deceased travelled to the family
home of the deceased, a property called 'Corio' at Eurongilly
via Junee.  On 2
March 1995, the prisoner left for Newcastle while the deceased remained at
Corio with her mother, Mrs. Celsa Cusack.
 On 4 March 1995, the deceased
telephoned the prisoner from Corio and told him that she wanted a month or so
to think things over.
 On 13 March 1995, the prisoner obtained temporary work
with the National Training Board and started work there on 21 March.  The
prisoner was to begin an alcohol rehabilitation course at Kedesh House at
Wollongong.  The prisoner did commence that course but
left Kedesh House on
Thursday 30 March 1995 and did not return.
<P>

	On Saturday 1 April 1995, the prisoner telephoned the deceased's mother at
Corio asking her to ask the deceased to contact him,
which she did.  The
deceased attempted on a number of occasions to contact the prisoner, who was by
now staying with friends at 9
Lilyfield Road Rozelle, and eventually spoke to
him at about 8.00 am on Sunday 2 April 1995.
<P>

	In this telephone call the prisoner apparently conveyed to the deceased that
he had to appear before the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal in Canberra on
Monday 3 April over an application for deportation which was then pending
against him.  The prisoner and
the deceased arranged that he would take the bus
from Sydney to Canberra and that the deceased would then meet him that evening
at
the Joliment Bus Terminal in Canberra City.
<P>

	In fact there was no hearing scheduled for 3 April or any other day.  The
deceased had on 7 March contacted the Department of Immigration
indicating that
she wished to support the deportation application.
<P>

	The prisoner left Rozelle at about 6.00 pm to travel by bus to Canberra and
the deceased left her flat at about 9.45 pm, having
first prepared a letter at
the prisoner's request for use before the AAT indicating that she had separated
from him on 2 March 1995
but that they were on amicable terms.  The deceased
also ironed a white shirt for the prisoner to wear at the hearing and hung this
and a grey suit over a coat hanger and took it with her in the car.
<P>

	The deceased drove her car, a silver Mazda 626 hatchback, registration number
MTD-377, to the Joliment bus terminal, met the accused
and drove to the Carotel
Hotel in Watson ACT, arriving at around 11.30 pm.  They registered under the
name of Barac and were allocated
room 32.  At 12.45 pm on Monday 3 April 1995,
the deceased telephoned Erica Stevens in Canberra and advised that she would be
spending
the night in a hotel with the prisoner.  The deceased was not seen
alive or heard from again.
<P>

	The deceased did not attend at work at the National Training Board on Monday 3
April or Tuesday 4 April 1995.  On Tuesday 4 April
1995, the deceased's mother
contacted the Major Crime Squad of the Australian Federal Police expressing
concerns for her daughter's
welfare.
<P>

	At about 10.00 am on Monday 3 April, the prisoner arrived at Lilyfield Road in
the deceased's car.  He spoke to Douglas Kuhl, his
first words being, 'All
hell's broken loose'.  He showed Mr. Kuhl a large open wound on the palm of his
right hand which was bleeding.
 The prisoner also had a three centimetre
circular blood stain on the front of his T-shirt.  Kuhl said to the prisoner,
'Where's
Helen?' to which he replied, 'She's in hospital'.  The prisoner asked
Kuhl if he could wash the car and without waiting for an answer
immediately
commenced to do so in the back courtyard of the house.
<P>

	A short time later Mr. Gus Laviano arrived at Lilyfield Road and spoke to the
accused.  Laviano asked 'What happened?' to which
the prisoner replied that he
had got into a fight and been stabbed by a man who was with the deceased when
she picked him up from
the Joliment bus terminal.  Robert Longbottom, a
security guard at the bus terminal who was on duty on the evening of 2 April,
says
there were no fights at the terminal that evening.  When Laviano asked him
about the car the prisoner said that the deceased had
thrown him the keys to
the car when he had the fight with the man.  The prisoner gave the keys to
Laviano who kept them in the glovebox
of his own car.  The keys, in an Oroton
leather case, belonged to the deceased.
<P>

	The prisoner then asked Laviano to drive him to the home of some friends of
the prisoner at Wallsend near Newcastle, which he did.
 On the way to Newcastle
they stopped at the medical practice of Dr. Chew in North Strathfield where the
wound in the prisoner's
right palm was stitched.  The consultation was at about
11.45 am.  Dr. Chew was of the opinion that the wound (consisting of two
lacerations) was a few hours old and that it was inflicted by a knife.  The
prisoner told Dr. Chew that he had arrived home at 8.00
am to find his wife in
bed with another man and that he punched the man and was stabbed by him.
<P>

	Laviano drove the prisoner to Wallsend, arriving at the home of the prisoner's
friends, Kim and Angela Maybury, at about 2.30 pm.
 The prisoner spent the
afternoon at the Mayburys.  Kim Maybury drove the prisoner to Broadmeadow
Railway Station around 7.30-8.00
pm.  At about 10.00 pm the prisoner arrived at
the home of his friend Troy Power in Mayfield and asked to stay the night.
<P>

	The prisoner left Power's house for the train station at about noon the next
day, with the stated intention of catching a train
to Sydney.
<P>

	About 3.30 pm on Tuesday 4 April police from Ashfield police station attended
the house at Lilyfield Road and observed the deceased's
car to be parked in the
rear courtyard.  Police observed some damage to the vehicle and blood stains on
the bonnet.  They did not
search inside the car (which was locked) but observed
a handbag (the deceased's) on the front passenger seat and a dark coloured
suit
and white shirt on a hanger.  Police had conversations with other occupants of
the house, Paul Bocska and John Devitt, asking
them to have the prisoner
contact Ashfield police.
<P>

	At about 4.30 pm the prisoner returned to Lilyfield Road.  Bocska told him
that the police had been at the house enquiring who
had a key for the car.
When the prisoner asked if the police had looked inside the car and Bocska
replied in the affirmative the
prisoner appeared to panic, got in the car,
backed it out of the driveway, hitting the gate post in the process, and drove
away.
<P>

	About 4.00 am on Thursday 6 April the prisoner went to Ashfield police station
in the deceased's car.  He was interviewed by Detective
Sergeant Mennilli
regarding his wife's disappearance.  He said that he left her at the hotel room
in Watson after an argument and
drove away in her car.  When questioned about
the cut to this (sic) hand he said that he injured it in a park in Rozelle by
smashing
a beer bottle, and that this had taken place after the deceased had
left him.
<P>

	On the same day he was arrested on a first instance warrant for breach of
parole (the breach being failure to totally abstain from
intoxicating liquor)
and was remanded in custody and sent to Maitland Correctional Centre.
<P>

	On 13 April a listening device warrant was obtained by Australian Federal
Police.  On 23 April a listening device was installed
in Cell 41 Wing B of
Maitland Correctional Centre which the prisoner was sharing with another
inmate.  The listening device was monitored
between 23 and 29 April.
<P>

	On 26 April the prisoner was interviewed by Detective Sergeant Brian McDonald
of the Australian Federal Police at Maitland Correctional
Centre, but again
said that he did not have any knowledge of his wife's whereabouts.
<P>

	Between 23 and 28 April the prisoner made admissions to his cellmate that he
had killed the deceased and dumped her body at Mooney
Mooney.  An arrangement
was made that the cellmate, when he was released from custody, would arrange to
properly dispose of the body
so that it would not be located.  The prisoner
drew a map for the cellmate indicating the location of the body.  A code was
devised
between them so that the cellmate could write to the prisoner letting
him know when the body had been disposed of.  The code was
found to have been
in the prisoner's handwriting. ...
<P>

	On 3 May the cellmate attended Blacktown Court and passed a note to escorting
police indicating that he had information about the
deceased..  He also handed
to police a document containing the handwritten code that he and the prisoner
had devised.
<P>

	On 28 April, following information received from the listening device, police
located the body of the deceased in bushland off
the Old Pacific Highway at
Mooney Mooney, approximately four kilometres north of the Brooklyn Bridge.  The
white shirt and grey suit
coat that the deceased had taken to the bus terminal
were found 35 metres from the deceased's body.  The deceased's blood was found
on both these items.
<P>

	A post mortem conducted on 29 April by Dr. Paul Botterill revealed the direct
cause of death to be knife wounds to the chest and/or
neck region.  There were
three holes in the upper chest area of the long sleeved T-shirt and jumper
which the deceased had been wearing.
 Only one of the holes in the jumper could
be said to have been caused by cutting but the position of the holes in the
jumper corresponded
with that in the garment underneath, the T-shirt.  The
prisoner had told Becerivic on 26 April that he had a knife with him in the
hotel room, having brought it from home.  Douglas Kuhl, in whose home the
prisoner had stayed on the night of Saturday 1 April, noticed
on 6 April that a
kitchen knife with a nine inch long blade was missing from his kitchen.  It had
last been seen on 30 or 31 March
when Kuhl sharpened it.  None of the other
occupants of the house had taken the knife.
<P>

	The deceased's blood was found in the interior of her car and in the boot and
her hair was found in the spare tyre well and surrounding
area, on the rear
parcel shelf and in the hinge of the rear parcel shelf."
<P>

9	That material was admitted by consent and its content was unchallenged.  It
is however largely silent on the circumstances immediately
surrounding the
killing which I am left to derive by inference from the other material admitted
into evidence.  There are a number
of matters in addition which need to be
examined and certain of the matters referred to in the statement of facts merit
examination
in more detail.
<P>

10	Following the charge, the prisoner declined to be interviewed by the police.
He has not given evidence before me as to the circumstances
of the killing.
The evidence of what happened is greatly dependent on his accounts to others
which were admitted by consent.  I will
consider those accounts in the context
of what independent proof there is affecting their acceptability.
<P>

11	The listening device which has already been referred to enabled the
recording of the conversations between the prisoner and his
cellmate.  The dry
recital of the effect of those conversations already set out does little
justice to the full gravity of the prisoner's
conduct.  Extracts of the
transcript of what was recorded have also been admitted in evidence before me.
Those extracts evidence
a chilling request by the prisoner to his cellmate to
dispose of the body of the deceased.  The prisoner refers to the body and the
death in a dramatically callous fashion, whilst urging the cellmate to
undertake the gruesome task of disposition of the remains.
 He asserted in one
of the conversations that the deceased was his wife;  that she was very cross;
that she had abused him over money;
 that she wanted money and that he was very
sorry the next day.  The prisoner is recorded as having put the deceased in the
boot
of the car whilst she was still alive and had some degree of awareness;
that as a result he stabbed her again and then said he was
sorry.  Some of the
matters to which he referred are independently corroborated.  Some are most
unlikely, eg., that his wife had
abused him over money.  There is no
corroboration in respect of the deceased being aware and stabbed again on being
returned to the
car boot.
<P>

12	The location of the body as revealed in those conversations accorded with
what was noted by Detective Senior Sergeant Llewellyn
when he observed its
location in the vicinity of Mooney Mooney off the verge of the Old Pacific
Highway.  The injuries to the body,
considering the lapse of time between death
and post-mortem, offer little assistance as to what had happened.
<P>

13	When Detective Senior Sergeant Llewellyn spoke to the prisoner at the
Maitland Police Station on 2 May 1995, the prisoner asserted
to the officer
that he had really loved his wife but that her family had caused it, her
brother had turned her against him telling
her things that he asserted were not
true to stop her from seeing him and that if he, the prisoner, did not keep
away from her the
brother had threatened to kill him.  Following legal advice,
the prisoner declined however to be further interviewed.
<P>

14	When the prisoner had earlier been interviewed on 6 April 1995 at Ashfield,
he had lied to the police as to his lack of awareness
as to what had happened
to his wife and although an interview was commenced, it did not continue when
the prisoner appeared to become
ill and said, "You just want me to say that I
killed and buried her".  The officer replied, "No-one's mentioned anything
about killing
and burying Helen".  The prisoner was later taken to hospital.
However prior to terminating the interview, the prisoner had informed
the
police during the interview that it was his wife who had arranged the meeting
in Canberra;  he having travelled by bus to the
meeting which was to be at the
Greyhound bus stop in Canberra, using a ticket booked and paid for by his wife;
that the purpose of
the meeting was to discuss his situation with her;  for him
to get some papers from the Department of Immigration;  to receive a
resume and
to receive his drug and alcohol certificate.  They met, talked and in due
course, he said, they went to a motel from which
his wife rang a friend, Erica.
(His account in this respect is corroborated by the statement of Erica Mary
Stevens which has been
tendered in evidence by the Crown.)  He went on to
assert that he and his wife made love but subsequently there was an argument
about
her family which caused him to leave her;  that he took her car and drove
away and that he felt sorry that he had left her and was
worried.
<P>

15	The deceased had told Erica Stevens that the prisoner actually had a meeting
with the Immigration Tribunal in Canberra appointed
for Monday 3 April 1995 and
that on Sunday 2 April at the flat which Ms. Stevens and the deceased shared,
the deceased had retrieved
some property from a storeroom which belonged to the
prisoner, typed a letter for the Tribunal that the prisoner had apparently
requested
and ironed a white shirt and pair of trousers for the prisoner to
wear.  The evidence discloses that there was no Tribunal hearing
listed for
that Monday involving the prisoner.  There were, however proceedings which had
last been before the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal on 22 February 1995 in
respect of the deportation of Mr. Barac.  The evidence does not disclose that
there was no possible
occasion for Mr. Barac to attend the Department on that
Monday.
<P>

16	There is in evidence confirmation of the couple arriving at the motel.  The
subsequent events including those surrounding the
killing, the disposal of the
body and the prisoner's journey to Newcastle remain extremely shady.  The
prisoner's accounts are inconsistent.
 His account of his wife's abuse of him
is unacceptable.  For the existence of some events there is only the prisoner's
unsupported
word.  For some there is confirmation to a greater or lesser
degree. As will appear the expert witnesses describe the prisoner's
background
and psychological conditions from which, in addition to the problem of his
accounts, I am left with the gravest doubts
as to the prisoner's credibility
and of the reliability in general and in detail of his accounts.  There are
clear lies and inconsistencies
internally and between the various accounts and
between his accounts and those of other witnesses.  There are so many
inconsistencies
on so many matters that it is appropriate to illustrate the
extent of the unreliability and inconsistency of the prisoner's accounts.
 I
set out various of the accounts from the reports and documents which were in
evidence by consent and which were unchallenged.
<P>

17	The prisoner's accounts had principally been given to Dr. Lucas and Dr.
Carne, psychiatrists and Ms. Anita Duffy, psychologist
during the investigation
of the prisoner's mental condition prior to entry of the plea of guilty, to the
cellmate and the police
in the conversations I have earlier described.
<P>

18	Oral evidence was not called from these witnesses before me on these
matters, the various reports being tendered without objection
and the views
expressed were left untested by cross-examination.
<P>

19	To Ms. Duffy on 22 July 1998, the prisoner asserted that he and his wife had
left Canberra and were travelling to Sydney when
"a huge argument developed
between them".  He did not, Ms. Duffy says, elaborate on the details of the
argument.  She says:-
<P>

	"He said that he stopped the car and slashed his wrists with a knife which he
had in the boot of the car.  Helen apparently then
tried to grab the knife from
him and in doing so he was cut along the right palm of his hand.  He wrestled
the knife back and it
was at this stage that he stabbed her twice.
<P>

	David then embarked on a very confused account of what he did with the body.
He said his first reaction was to try and find a hospital
but there was none in
the vicinity.  He then ascertained that she was dead, put her in the boot and
drove her to Sydney.  He left
her in the car parked at Rozelle and took the
train to Newcastle.  At this stage he told a friend, Troy Palmer, what he had
done,
who said he 'did not want to hear about it'.  He returned to Sydney,
presumably by train, returned to the car with the body still
in the boot, drove
to Newcastle and dumped the body on the way, at Mooney Mooney.  He then
continued his journey to Newcastle and
spoke to Peter Hillman, another friend,
and the next day returned to Sydney where he handed himself in at the Ashfield
police station."
<P>

20	On 26 July 1998, the prisoner informed Dr. Lucas:-
<P>

	"I asked him what had happened on the trip to Wollongong.   He said that they
had started arguing an hour and a half out of Canberra.
 In reply to a question
about the subject matter of the argument, he said that 'she wanted a baby ...'.
In reply to my question about
who began the argument he said, 'both went the
same way - I was suicidal ...'.  A further question received the response, 'she
wanted
a child but she wanted to die too'.  He said that she had wanted to die
'when we were making love in Canberra'.  Apparently he did
not know why she
wanted to but 'I said to her the same'.  They were 'sick of the family
interrupting, only six weeks after marrying'.
<P>

	Mr. Barac spoke of the argument occurring an hour or an hour and 20 minutes
from Canberra.  (He told Ms. Duffy it had occurred
20 minutes after leaving
Canberra.)
<P>

	The argument went for a good 15 minutes 'till I decided, okay now is
finished'.  She said 'yeah'.  Mr. Barac said that's when he
stopped the car at
the side of the highway.
<P>

	At this point in the interview he said, 'I was, this is what I can't remember,
drink and cocaine and all that'.  I asked for more
information and he said he
could not remember from that point.  I told him that without further
information I would be unable to
form an opinion with regard to his defence.
He then went on to say, 'I think I want - the voices started calling me'.  He
told me
it was 'Satan's voice'.
<P>

	He went to the boot of the car, 'I had to pull the knife from there'.  He said
this was because 'I want to kill me'.  He told me
the knife was always in the
car as he worked as a cook and always had to have cutlery.  I could get no
other information at why knives
would have been in his wife's car.
<P>

	He said he started to slash himself.  He showed me a very small scar on his
left wrist and also one which was scarcely obvious
in his right cubital
fossa.
<P>

	His wife told him not to.  Apparently this action with the knife had occurred
in the front of the car with Mr. Barac occupying
the drivers seat.  Mr. Barac
said he had the knife in his hand, the left one, when 'she pushed my hand'.  He
showed me how the point
of the knife had been pushed towards his throat by his
wife and he had placed the palm of his right hand in front of it.  He showed
me
an irregular scar on the palm of the right hand.
<P>

	He then told me that she had the knife which he had put down after slashing
his wrists.  He had done this as he wanted to show
her he loved her so much.
When I asked why she had picked up the knife he said, 'I think she was going to
do to herself'.  He also
said that she was going to stab his neck, the reason
for this being, 'I wanted to die still'.  Mr. Barac then demonstrated how he
had stabbed her with what appeared to be a backhand blow with the knife held in
his left hand pointing downwards.  He had done this
as 'she wanted to die too'.
He said that she was dead when he stopped.  He had stabbed her in the chest or
neck region, he had learned
from the autopsy report.
<P>

	I asked what happened next.  He said she was still in the passengers seat of
the Mazda.  He decided to try and look for a hospital
as she had 'lost her
voice' and was not breathing.  However he only saw a petrol station.  He was
hoping to see a sign for Goulburn
Hospital.  However he drove to Lilyfield Road
in Rozelle.  The body of his wife was in the boot of the car where he had
placed it
half an hour after looking for someone to help.
<P>

	He saw friends and said he had had a fight with someone.  He said one friend
took him to Newcastle.  I said that he should have
been going to Wollongong but
he said he had been told he would be 'sacked' from the programme and police
were looking for him.  He
said he telephoned the rehabilitation programme in
Wollongong.  In Newcastle he went to friends who did not know what to do.  His
car had been left in Rozelle with the body in the boot.  He said he wanted the
police to find it there.  In Newcastle he told a friend
what he had done but
the friend said he did not want to be involved.
<P>

	I asked what had happened to the body.  He said when going from Sydney to
Newcastle he had dumped the body at Mooney Mooney.  I
asked if the friend had
helped, he said he had not.  I remarked that the friend would have been in the
car, according to the account
he had already given me and he said that he had
gone to Newcastle and returned to Sydney by train, looked at the car finding it
was
still there and had then gone to Mooney Mooney.  In Newcastle he stayed for
a night, was told the police were looking for him, for
breach of parole, and he
had then gone to Ashfield Police Station and given himself up.  He said the car
was left at the police station."
<P>

21	Dr. Carne, who had examined the prisoner a number of times in 1995 and 1996
and who was his treating psychiatrist in his role
as visiting consultant
forensic psychiatrist to the Corrections Health Service, had also had access to
prison clinical notes in respect
of the prisoner's psychiatric and medical
conditions whilst in custody in respect of the sentence he had previously been
serving.
 He also had the reports of Dr. Lucas and Ms. Duffy.
<P>

22	The account given by the prisoner to Dr. Carne was that the couple had left
at about 4.00 am the Canberra motel, that a violent
argument continued on the
journey.  (The account was interrupted at this point for about an hour while
the prisoner had treatment
for what Dr. Carne described as a frank panic
attack.)  Dr. Carne, in describing the account, continued:-
<P>

	"After about an hour and a half, they stopped the car.  Mr. Barac told me that
he wanted to show Helen that he did not want to
live without her.  He went to
the boot of the car, pulled out a knife which he had there, along with some
other belongings.  Mr.
Barac told me he wanted to die and wanted to kill
himself.  He told me he was very suicidal.  He told me 'it was like I was
possessed.
 Everything went black', and demonstrating to me in the interview,
told me that he slashed his wrists with a knife.  He told me that
he wanted to
show Helen how much he loved her.
<P>

	Helen apparently panicked at his behaviour, Mr. Barac dropped the knife into
the space between the driver's seat and the passenger
seat in which she was
sitting.  Helen then grabbed the knife.  Mr. Barac thought she was going to cut
herself so then he grabbed
the knife, there was a struggle in which the knife
lunged toward his face, he put his hand out and was cut on the palm of the
hand.
<P>

	Mr. Barac then grabbed the knife in his left hand and swung the knife at her,
stabbing her.  Mr. Barac told me he was confused
and mixed up.  He could not
believe what he had done.  He said that Helen slumped back on the seat, stopped
talking and then stopped
breathing.
<P>

	At this time, Mr. Barac said he could not understand what was going through
his head.  He said he was not his normal mental state.
<P>

	He panicked and in an apparently disorganised way tried to find a hospital.
<P>

	He ended up driving to Rozelle but before he drove to Rozelle he put his
wife's body in the back of the car so, clearly, he realised
that she was
dead."
<P>

23	There is evidence from Detective Sergeant Mennilli of the Ashfield
Detectives and from Mr. Gus Laviano of the presence of the
deceased's car in
the rear yard of the premises at 9 Lilyfield Road, Rozelle.  On the prisoner's
accounts, when the car was observed
there by Mr. Laviano, Mr. Bocska and Mr.
Devitt as well as the police, the deceased's body must then have been in the
boot.
<P>

24	The prisoner also gave accounts to Detective Sergeant Mennilli, Dr. Chew and
Mr. Laviano.
<P>

25	When the prisoner saw Detective Sergeant Mennilli at the Ashfield Police
Station on 6 April 1995, he said that the last time
he had seen his wife was
when they had had a fight and he took her car and drove back to Sydney.  He
told Detective Mennilli that
he had driven in the car from Canberra and then to
Newcastle it having been driven to Rozelle on the Monday.  He told Detective
Mennilli
that the injuries to his hand had occurred in that after he had left
his wife he was upset and was at a little park near Rozelle
and had smashed a
bottle of beer which he had in his hand.  He had been examined by Dr. Chew on
the morning of 3 April 1995 and had
informed Dr. Chew that the injuries had
been occasioned in a fight with his wife's boyfriend.  He had punched the man,
the man took
out a knife and stabbed him.  He used his hand to fend him off, he
said.
<P>

26	Mr. Laviano had accompanied the prisoner to Dr. Chew's surgery.  He had been
told by the prisoner that he (the prisoner) had
to go to Canberra to go to
court for breach of parole.  Mr. Laviano had been informed by Mr. Doug Kuhl who
is one of the occupants
of the premises at 9 Lilyfield Road, Rozelle that the
deceased had rung to say that she had organised the bus transport for the
prisoner
to get to Canberra on the Sunday evening and that a motel had been
booked.
<P>

27	Mr. Laviano sets out in his statement the account given to him by the
prisoner on the morning of 3 April 1995 explaining his
injuries:-
<P>

	"I said, 'What's happened?'.  He said, 'I got into a fight and got stabbed in
the hand'.  He then held out his left hand and I
saw wound (sic) that appeared
very deep and needed medical attention.  I said, 'Why did you get into a
fight?'.  He said, 'When I
got off the bus I was met by Helen and another
fella.  I said to Helen, Who's this fella" he said "Who are you talking to you
piece
of shit?'.  I said to him "Who are you calling a piece of shit your words
are quite tough let's see how tough you are I'll give you
a run"'.  David said,
'All of sudden this guy put his hand behind his back I was puzzled and the next
thing I knew he had a knife'.
 I didn't get any more details after that."
<P>

28	He drove with the prisoner to Newcastle and during the journey was informed
by the prisoner that "when I had the fight with the
bloke, Helen threw me the
keys".
<P>

29	There are, despite the other inconsistencies, not all of which are
explicable by an intent to deceive or to try to put things
in the most
favourable light, some important consistencies including that the killing
occurred at a time in which the stresses of
the relationship had engendered
great emotion in the prisoner but beyond that it is hard to find a satisfactory
basis to piece together
a reliable account of these crucial events.
<P>

30	The reason for the presence of the knife and the manner of its use can be
resolved however.
<P>

31	The statement of Mr. Kuhl discloses that on 6 April 1995, a narrow bladed
knife was noted as missing from the kitchen drawer
where it was usually kept,
having been placed there after sharpening on or about 30 or 31 March at a time
when the prisoner was staying
at the house.  Thus there was corroboration for
the assertion that the prisoner had armed himself with the knife before
journeying
to Canberra.
<P>

32	It was the opinion of Dr. Paul Botterill, the forensic pathologist,
following the post mortem that the deceased had died in circumstances
consistent with death having been caused by knife wounds to the chest and/or
neck region.  There were four notable bodily injuries
consistent with knife
wounds noted by the doctor and a number of defects, as he described them, in
the deceased's clothing which
could be consistent with knife wounds.
<P>

33	The prisoner had clearly taken the knife with him and used it to kill the
deceased.
<P>

34	It is on that material and in the light of the psychiatric and psychological
opinion expressed by Drs. Lucas and Carne and Ms.
Duffy respectively concerning
the prisoner and having regard to the prisoner's prior criminal record of
violence against his former
spouse that the Crown submits that the maximum
sentence for this crime should be imposed on the basis that this murder can be
characterised
as falling within the worst category of such cases.  In
particular it is asserted that I should find that the killing was premeditated
and that the prisoner, having taken with him from Sydney the knife that was in
fact used to kill the deceased, I should at least
find that the prisoner had a
pre-determined intent to inflict upon the deceased at least serious bodily harm
if she refused to reconcile
with him.
<P>

35	Further it is submitted that notwithstanding the psychological evidence as
to the unreliability of the prisoner's accounts that
I should be satisfied that
the prisoner placed the deceased in the boot of the car whist she was alive and
later stopped the car
and again stabbed her, to silence her, killing the
deceased.
<P>

36	It is further submitted that the killing was callous and unmitigated by any
suggestion of provocation.
<P>

37	The plea of guilty, it is put, was unaccompanied by any real contrition,
made late and in the face of a Crown case to which the
prisoner had no answer
and thus attracting little weight when considering the matters required by
s.439 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.  (I have already dealt with this submission and
have accepted it to a great extent.)
<P>

38	It is also contended that the psychiatric evidence and the circumstances of
the prior offence are such as to show that the prisoner
has such a dangerous
propensity that the need to protect the community requires that the sentence
provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> of penal servitude for life should be
passed.
<P>

39	Although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A(1)</a> prescribes that the maximum penalty for murder is penal
servitude for life, s.442 of the Act authorises the passing of a lesser
sentence.
 However, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A(2)</a>, a person sentenced to penal servitude for life
for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's
natural
life.
<P>

40	Section 431B(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> was not in operation at the time of
this offence.  It provides:-
<P>

	"A court is to impose a sentence of penal servitude for life on a person who
is convicted of murder, if the court is satisfied
that the level of culpability
in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in
retribution, punishment,
community protection and deterrence can only be met
through the imposition of that sentence.".
<P>

41	Section 431B(7) provides:-
<P>

	"This section does not apply to offences committed before the commencement of
this section.
<P>

42	Therefore it will be necessary to examine the case law which applied prior
to the commencing in operation of s.431B and that
case law particularly
required the examination of the heinous features of the crime:  <b>Regina v.
Garforth </b>(CCA, unreported 23 May 1994) and the dangerousness of the
prisoner:  <b>Veen v.  The Queen (No. 2)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988) 164 CLR 465.</a>  The
Crown submits those matters can only be properly considered in the context of
the attack on the prisoner's first wife.  I therefore
turn to the circumstances
of the prior offence and to the other evidence concerning the prisoner's
background, make up and to assess
his dangerousness.
<P>

43	The prisoner was born on 20 August 1966 and in New South Wales has a
conviction for stealing on 14 July 1989 for which he was
fined $300.  On 3
December 1992, he was fined $400 for a domestic violence assault and on 26
March 1993, on his plea of guilty, he
was convicted on one count that he did
maliciously wound his then wife Joanne Barac with intent to inflict grievous
bodily harm upon
her and had taken into account an associated offence which the
sentencing judge categorised as "what might be described in short
terms at
least as the kidnapping of his estranged wife, the said Joanne Barac, at the
same date and place".  He had been, the previous
day, dealt with by the
Newcastle Local Court for breach of a domestic violence order in respect of
which he received a fixed term
of imprisonment of 14 days.  For the malicious
wounding and taking into account the kidnapping, the learned District Court
judge
sentenced the prisoner to penal servitude for four and a half years to
date from 22 September 1992, being the day on which the prisoner
had gone into
custody, and specified as a minimum period two years, expiring on 21 September
1994.
<P>

44	The background to that sentence and the facts of the offence were dealt with
by the sentencing judge in some detail.  The offence
had arisen out of the
breakdown of the prisoner's marriage and that was, at least, in part due to,
and certainly exacerbated by,
the prisoner's compulsive over-indulgence in
alcohol.  The couple had previously separated and the prisoner's wife was
driven to
live in a refuge.  The marriage had been attended by a degree of
violence and indeed, although a domestic violence order had been
made, on the
very day that the order had been made and acknowledged by the prisoner, he
breached it making life threatening statements
to his wife.
<P>

45	Upon receiving bail for that breach, he breached the order again.  His
Honour considered that the prisoner was a compulsive character
on the subject
of communicating with his wife, not willing to be bound by the shackles of
orders preventing him from approaching
her.  The prisoner had given evidence in
the District Court that he was in the habit of going and spying upon his wife
and child
and had gone to their home on 21 September equipped with a knife with
"revenge in his heart" because he was angry about not being
given access
pursuant to some arrangement.  He had prepared by dressing in black and had
been drinking.  When he saw the gentleman
who was then living in the house with
his wife, as a boarder, he lost any vestige of control.  He circled the house
seeking a way
to do harm to this man.  When his wife and 18 month old child
arrived at the home he attacked her, striking her blows to the head,
knocking
her to the ground and stabbing her with such force as to break the blade of the
knife from the handle.  She feigned unconsciousness
and death but he forced her
to her feet, bound her, forced her into the car, allowing her from time to time
to tend to the child
and took her back to another house there detaining her.
<P>

46	These events occupied a period of some hours during which time he was
continually displaying and menacing his wife with knives.
 The learned District
Court judge categorised the offence as one of extreme gravity.  It is
punishable by a maximum penalty of 25
years penal servitude and was committed
not only whilst the prisoner was the subject of a domestic violence order but
on conditional
liberty for having breached that.  It was an offence committed
with more than one knife.  His Honour, however, was of the view that
the
seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the subjective elements.  He
accepted complete and utter contrition and co-operation,
the willingness of the
prisoner to endeavour to come to terms with alcohol but was of the view that
the sentence necessitated a component
to mark the seriousness of the offence
and to deter the offender personally.
<P>

47	How effective the orders of the courts including his Honour's order have
been in this man's case can be gauged not only from
the circumstances in which
the prisoner committed that offence but from the short period of time following
his release before the
commission of this offence and the fact that he was
again the subject of conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the
offence.
<P>

48	Again, to me and also to the deceased's family, the prisoner expressed
contrition.  Tendered in evidence at the plea were undated
letters addressed to
the deceased's family referring to the prisoner's suicidal intent and the
hearing of voices.  His mental condition,
as I later relate, is such that
whilst I accept that he is genuinely protesting his contrition, I do not accept
that what he feels
is the emotion of contrition as normally understood.
<P>

49	Whilst in custody the prisoner was considered to be a serious suicide risk
and was detained in the Long Bay Prison Hospital.
 He was diagnosed as having
an adjustment disorder with histrionic and anti-social personality traits by
the Corrections Health Service
who furnished psychotropic medication to him
after a serious suicide attempt on or about 14 July 1998.
<P>

50	Whilst in custody the prisoner has attended various alcohol and drugs
programmes including Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics
Anonymous meetings.  He
had participated in peer support network, anger management programme, HIV and
health promotion information
workshop, drink drive prevention programme and
stress management, receiving in each case an appropriate certificate.  He had
attended
church services and had obtained a head sweepers job being courteous
and respectful to the Chaplain.
<P>

51	The assessment by the alcohol and other drug workers report of 17 July 1996
to the Offenders Review Board based on a history
given by the prisoner notes
that he commenced use of cocaine, cannabis and tranquillisers during his
teenage years at school in Peru
and heroin and hallucinogenic use in 1986 when
in Israel.  He has a history of extensive abuse of those drugs and alcohol.  He
was
a product of a family where the father was an abuser of drugs and alcohol
and quite often physically assaulted his mother.  The prisoner
had informed the
Service that his utilisation of drugs produced episodes of aggressive and
violent behaviour, blackouts, indiscriminate
drinking, relationship and
financial problems and criminal activity.
<P>

52	As at the commission of the offence for which he was dealt with by Judge
Freeman, he had apparently that day consumed two 750
ml bottles of spirits as
well as smoking pot and snorting cocaine.
<P>

53	It would appear that with the effects of alcoholism and drug misuse, the
prisoner produces violent and aggressive behaviour as
a totally inappropriate
reaction to conflict situations.
<P>

54	The report of 17 July 1996 was prepared to assess the prospect of the
release of the prisoner to parole.  Even without the benefit
of the psychiatric
and psychological opinions now tendered and the circumstances of the offence
before me, it recommended a structured
long term rehabilitation programme and
particularly a need for long term intervention in regard to cognitive and
behavioural change,
whether in the community or in gaol.  It is quite apparent
that that assessment and the mechanisms suggested in the recommendation
were of
little utility to modify the reaction of the prisoner to the stresses
experienced by him arising from his emotional attachment
to his wives.
<P>

55	The views of Dr. Lucas and Dr. Carne and Ms. Duffy are of assistance to
ascertaining the prisoner's subjective circumstances
and potential
dangerousness.
<P>

56	Ms. Duffy in her report of 30 July 1998 set out in considerable detail the
prisoner's prior history and in particular refers
to his meeting his second
wife at Junee Gaol in 1993 where she was an English teacher and had taught him
English as he taught her
Spanish.  What follows is taken from her report.
<P>

57	Following his release on 21 September 1994, they lived at Potts Point as she
by then was working with Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
 Following the marriage, he
worked as a chef at the Messaluna Restaurant for some six months until they
moved to Adelaide in February
1995 to live together whilst he applied to study
as a minister of religion in the Wesley Mission in Adelaide.  It was on the way
to Adelaide that, according to the prisoner, the family sought to disrupt their
married life and it was as a consequence of the family's
lack of acceptance of
him that he decided to leave his wife and return to Newcastle to stay with
friends.  He went on 6 March 1995
to an alcohol rehabilitation programme at
Wollongong at Kedesh House and was required to participate in an appropriate
programme
whilst on release as a condition of his parole.
<P>

58	He had attempted suicide on three occasions whilst in custody following his
arrest for the present offence and over the years
asserted he had suffered with
chronic depression in concert with long term alcoholism turning to religious
communities including
in particular the Pentacostal Church.  He had asserted
that he had been hearing voices from the age of 13 or 14, having been placed
in
a psychiatric hospital in Peru after he had heard voices telling him to shoot
people.  He had heard voices in Israel telling him
to destroy a disco and spent
six months in a psychiatric hospital as a consequence.
<P>

59	His Corrective Services medical file refers to symptoms of depression,
anxiety and borderline personality disorder, together
with references to
hearing voices.  But these are often accompanied by notes indicating he may be
manipulative and attention seeking.
 There are references in the papers to
assertions of his mother's death, notwithstanding it may well be that she is
alive, though
not well and living in Israel.
<P>

60	The general tenor of those notes, according to Ms. Duffy, indicates
demanding, impulsive, attention seeking behaviour often accompanied
by requests
for medication, 'with growing agitation he faces his court appearances'.  All
the psychiatrist's notes seem to indicate
no evidence of psychosis, rather a
personality disorder, reactive depression and anxiety.
<P>

61	The prisoner had spoken to Ms. Duffy of voices in his head prompting him to
kill the deceased before he himself was killed. 
Ms. Duffy, however, points out
that his hearing voices has been referred to frequently in his prison medical
file but little credence
has been made of them apart from manipulative or
attention seeking motivations.  The notes, according to Ms. Duffy, make much of
the prisoner's tendency to get very angry when things do not go his way.  She
concludes:-
<P>

	"He is certainly a very dependent personality, who, since his separation from
Helen, appears to have been attempting many strategies
to be reunited with
her."
<P>

62	Ms. Duffy concludes that he is a person who is highly jealous, possessive
and insecure, the subject of a pattern of self-pity,
dejection and stubbornness
punctuated periodically by angry outbursts.  She does not accept his instances
of hearing voices or assertions
of being led by Satan and that his personality
disorder makes him extremely susceptible to rejection and thus to feelings of
depression,
fear and anger.
<P>

63	The clinical notes from the Prison Medical Service, the Newcastle Mater
Misericordiea Hospital and Ms. Duffy's report were made
available to Dr.
William Lucas who, after interviewing the prisoner, concluded that he did not
have any psychiatric defence and after
having regard to the statement of facts,
the transcript of the conversations with the cellmate, type-written notes by
Mr. Barac about
his background, the offence and related matters provided to his
solicitor, and the alcohol and other drug workers report referred
to above,
shared the view of Ms. Duffy that:-
<P>

	"As much objective verification as possible is needed in David's case as he
tends to be rather histrionic, manipulative and over-embellish."
<P>

64	There were clear inconsistencies between what the prisoner gave to Dr. Lucas
by way of psychiatric and medical background and
that which he had given to Ms.
Duffy.  However, once again, he asserted prior psychiatric conditions in Peru
and Israel, the abusive
family background and the hearing of voices.  It is
notable that he informed Dr. Lucas that the knife he used in the killing was
used as the voices were calling to him and had been obtained from the boot of
the car where the knife was always kept as he worked
as a cook.  As I have set
out above, he told Dr. Lucas he started to slash himself and showed Dr. Lucas a
very small scar on the
left wrist and one which was scarcely obvious in the
right cubital fossa.  He said that his wife had pushed his hand pushing the
point of the knife towards his throat causing him to jab the knife into the
palm of his right hand and that that was how the injury
seen by Dr. Chew was
occasioned, that she had obtained the knife and he further gave Dr. Lucas a
confused account of a belief that
she was going to attempt suicide or was going
to kill him and that he had stabbed her as "she wanted to die too".  He said to
Dr.
Lucas that she was dead when he stopped stabbing her.  He said he had tried
to look for a hospital but saw only a petrol station
and was hoping to see a
sign for Goulburn Hospital but drove from  Goulburn to Rozelle.  The
inconsistency of his account concerning
how the body came to be placed at
Mooney Mooney was noted by Dr. Lucas.  His accounts of his background to Dr.
Lucas include assertions
of his brother having committed suicide, his father
committing suicide, his sister attempting suicide, his mother being, variously
dead, in Colombia or in Israel.  His presentation to Dr. Lucas at interview led
to Dr. Lucas observing"-
<P>

	"It was at least possible he was attempting to simulate a major psychiatric
disorder."
<P>

65	Dr. Lucas did not accept the assertions of psychotic symptoms and in
particular command hallucinations at the time of the stabbing.
 Dr. Lucas
concluded that the prisoner was suffering from a relatively severe personality
disorder, probably borderline in type but
with anti-social and histrionic
traits accompanied by a considerable degree of lability of mood and
vulnerability to reacting adversely
to life events.  Dr. Lucas concluded that
the prisoner had now accepted the reality of his legal situation and that
during the lengthy
period of imprisonment that was inevitable it would be
necessary for the prisoner to continue with appropriate drug and alcohol
programmes
and psychological counselling;  that his personality is such that
there will be difficult periods during imprisonment and a need
for psychiatric
assessment and treatment.
<P>

66	For the future, Dr. Lucas said:-
<P>

	"His psychiatric prognosis is guarded but the manifestations of personality
disorder often ameliorate with time.  I am not in a
position to predict how Mr.
Barac will progress over the years and there are indications that his prognosis
must be guarded.  When
he finally returns to the community he will require
supervision and he will need to adhere to conditions which almost certainly
would
be imposed with regard to his use of alcohol and drugs. His prognosis
with regard to future violent conduct will depend not only
on the degree to
which his personality resolves but also his ability to abstain from alcohol and
drugs and his ability to handle
future personal relationships.  The possibility
of violence towards women is likely to be a continuing concern."
<P>

67	Dr. Lucas was asked by the prosecution in consequence of being furnished a
copy of the sentencing remarks on the charge of malicious
wounding I referred
to above, whether that material affected the views he had expressed as to the
prisoner's prognosis.  Dr. Lucas
noted that the account of the circumstances
leading to the offence given to him by the prisoner was inaccurate in a number
of respects
and that the facts of that 1992 offence contained a number of
disturbing elements of relevance when related to the facts underlying
the
murder of his second wife.  In both cases the prisoner had been abusing
alcohol, notwithstanding supervision and a rehabilitation
programme after
release in 1994.  In both cases the marriage had broken down.  In both cases
the offences involved the use of a knife
and premeditation to the extent of
having available a knife.  In both cases the prisoner was not obeying the
lawful restrictions
placed on him.  The contrition expressed after the first
offence did not apparently lead to insight such as to avoid the second offence.
As a consequence, Dr. Lucas re-evaluated his former conclusion saying:-
<P>

	"In my opinion, Mr. Barac's psychiatric prognosis with respect to his severe
personality disorder, marked by antisocial and borderline
traits, and his abuse
of alcohol and possibly drugs, must be considered at best very guarded and may
be poor.  His history of violence
to his first wife, the murder of his second
and his non-compliance with conditions placed on him is of great concern.
Measures aimed
at controlling his use of alcohol and drugs after his 1992
offence ended in failure.  The problems experienced by myself and others
in
obtaining accurate and consistent information about his background suggest
further efforts at treatment and rehabilitation will
be difficult.
<P>

	With this constellation of problems, it is difficult to predict if the passage
of time will have a favourable effect on Mr. Barac's
personality and his
ability to behave responsibly in relationships and avoid abuse of alcohol and
drugs.  A central issue is his
propensity to react with violence when feelings
of rejection and perhaps jealousy arise during relationships with women.
Independent
or well corroborated information about his background should be
sought by those caring for him so a better assessment of his problems
can be
gained."
<P>

68	Further, there was on behalf of the prisoner in evidence, a detailed report
from Dr. Carne, psychiatrist, who was also of the
view that the prisoner had a
severe personality disorder and a substantial substance dependence involving
the turning to violence
and the suffering of pathological jealousy accompanied
by panic attacks and possible brief psychotic episodes.  He too expressed
the
view that personality disorders do tend to ameliorate with age, particularly at
middle age and that the prisoner's problems with
alcohol and substance abuse
require he remain abstinent and receive appropriate drug and alcohol
psychological counselling and psychiatric
treatment.  He expressed the view
that there is considerable rehabilitative potential but that without an
extended period of rehabilitation
there is a serious risk that the prisoner
would return to drug and alcohol abuse, relationship problems and during
periods of intoxication
would suffer similar episodes of pathological jealousy
and violence.  He contends that a period of custody during which the prisoner
abstains, is counselled and, if necessary, treated is probably an important
component of any rehabilitation.  He was further of the
view that an extended
period of parole with close monitoring is essential together with an
appropriate condition of abstinence from
substance use.  He concluded by
pointing out that there is evidence that newer medication and abstinence from
substance abuse over
several years of treatment can offer prospects.  I accept
the views of Dr. Carne and Dr. Lucas.
<P>

69	None of the psychiatric or psychological evidence refers to the precise or
even the general extent of such a period as would
be required to have the
requisite effect but it is obvious that it would be very long indeed and
necessarily to be considered in
the context of the natural progress of age in
the prisoner and its effects.  All of that evidence establishes the prisoner's
lack
of credibility, indeed because of his condition that lack is probably
constitutional.  It is clear that the prisoner is entirely
vulnerable to the
effects of emotion and liable to homicidal violence because of it.
<P>

70	It is in that context that the Crown submits that the sentence provided for
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A(2)</a> should be passed, submitting that this is one in the worst category
of cases:  (<b>The Queen v. Baker</b> (CCA, unreported 20 September 1995)), in
that it is accompanied by particular features of very great heinousness and it
is possible
to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the
crime:  (<b>Regina v. Twala</b> (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994)).  It is
submitted that the use of the knife was premeditated and the entire occasion in
the ACT
was staged to permit an attack and that such findings would support the
heinousness necessary on the case law to be found for the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A(2)</a> sentence to
be passed.  It is submitted that the facts as found in respect of the 1992
offence should enable similar conclusions
as to the circumstances of the
present offence to be drawn.  In particular it is submitted that I should
conclude that the reason
for the prisoner arming himself with a knife before
meeting the deceased should be seen as akin to the reason he gave in respect
of
the 1992 offence, ie. "with revenge in his heart";  and that there is a pattern
of deliberate disobedience of the law, in particular
of orders seeking to
prevent the recurrence of violent attacks, such that the moral culpability of
the offender in the instant case
and a dangerous propensity on his part are
demonstrated showing a need to impose condign punishment to deter him and
others:  <b>Veen v. The Queen (No. 2)</b> (supra) at 477 was cited.
<P>

71	It is submitted that the evidence from Dr. Lucas and Dr. Carne is such that
the necessary risk of danger, ie. dangerous propensity,
in the context of the
evidence of the features of the two crimes is established and that the best
predictor of future dangerous conduct
is past dangerous conduct.  It is
submitted that Dr. Lucas' "very guarded" prognosis is such that as to mitigate
against extending
leniency and in favour of a prediction that the offender will
remain dangerous.  As to the conclusion of Dr. Carne, the Crown cites
a passage
from the judgment of Mason, J. (as he then was) in <b>Veen v. The Queen (No.
1)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20143%20CLR%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 143 CLR 458</a> at 469 approving a passage from the judgment of
Gibbs, J. (as he then was) in <b>Regina v. Pedder</b> (Queensland, CCA,
unreported 29 May 1964).
<P>

	"'Even in cases where it is hoped that mental treatment may so ameliorate the
condition of the offender that it would eventually
be safe to discharge him,
although it is not known how long it would take to achieve this result, it may
still be necessary, in the
present state of the law, for the court to impose a
sentence of life imprisonment, if that is not otherwise inappropriate to the
circumstances of the crime, rather than let loose a man whose abnormality of
mind may lead him to commit further killings.'
<P>

	His Honour went on to say (at 469):-
<P>

	'The court imposes a sentence of life imprisonment on taking account of the
offender's record, his propensity to commit violent
crime, the need to protect
the community and the very serious offence of which he stands convicted.'"
<P>

72	As to this last, it is to be remembered that his Honour, Gibbs, J. in
<b>Pedder</b> (supra) and what their Honours in the High Court were speaking of
was, as was made express both in their judgments and that of the
sentencing
judge, a sentence liable to amelioration by release on licence often at a
comparatively early date.  They were not speaking
about the type of sentence
now provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.  The observations cited cannot be
understood as referring to a situation where the prisoner is "never to be
released" whether his
condition might or might not be the subject of
amelioration such that it would eventually be safe to discharge him.  Even
then, <b>Veen (No. 1)</b> (supra) was a decision which concerned that degree of
satisfaction necessary to be established on the evidence of the likelihood
of
further offences before the life sentence as it then existed, might
appropriately be passed, (in the context of an offender being
deprived of
leniency to which he might otherwise have been entitled by reason of future
dangerousness).
<P>

73	The Crown submission as to the surrounding circumstances of this offence and
the submission that I should find premeditation,
that is, that the knife was
taken for the purpose of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm unless
reconciliation occurred, does
not sit well with the corroborated length of time
during which the prisoner and the deceased were together apparently without
violence
in Canberra prior to leaving on the car trip to return to Sydney.
<P>

74	There can be no doubt that the knife was taken with a view to some form of
violence.  Whether by way of suicidal violence or
homicidal violence or both,
pre-determined, contingent or vaguely both is not at all clear since I consider
the other evidence does
not establish or support any of the particular
scenarios asserted by the prisoner, and I have difficulty in accepting in many
respects
even the broad details of his various accounts.  But even considering
that, the prisoner did not give evidence and that this failure
may be to some
extent explained by his psychiatric condition such that he may not, at least
now, know what truth is and what is merely
his own histrionic and false
account, on the evidence I do not find beyond reasonable doubt that there was
an intention, pre-existing
the crime, to kill or seriously injure his wife by
way of revenge or even contingently unless she reconciled with him.  The
evidence
is not inconsistent with an attempt to act out some dramatic display
of suicide or attempted suicide.  The evidence does not allow
me to conclude
that there was premeditation in the sense of a planned killing, or a planned or
determined occasion for such a thing,
although it is clear enough that the
knife was taken to a meeting fraught with emotional explosive potential.  It is
also clear that
the prisoner should have realised the terrible dangers
associated with his own psychological make up and predilections including
to
substance abuse.  His is obviously a personality that at present is dangerous
in the context of his emotional links with his partners
and the apparently
irresistible pressures his personality and addictions impose on these links.
<P>

75	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of circumstances of heinousness
or aggravation such as are discussed in <b>Garforth</b> (supra) and
<b>Twala</b> (supra).  On the evidence I am not satisfied that the killing in
this case did not occur as a result of an emotional eruption in
which the
prisoner's psychological condition allowed him limited control.  The
psychiatric opinion supports such a scenario.
<P>

76	I have had regard to what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in
<b>Baker</b> (supra) and although I am cognisant of what Allen, J. said in his
dissent, the judgment of the Chief Justice and Barr, J. dealing
with the
criteria for offences of murder of the "worst category of case" leads me to the
conclusion that this present crime whilst
not in that category, approaches it
closely, particularly in the context of the previous offence and the matters
observed by the
psychiatrists.  This, however, is not the end of the matter
because the very propensity to homicidal rage in the absence of emotional
controls and when afflicted by stress leads to considering the very matters
dealt with by the High Court in <b>Veen (No. 2)</b> (supra), ie.,
dangerousness.  The prisoner's mental condition and prior circumstances are no
doubt the explanation at least in part
of his present potential for violence.
Thus these matters do not mitigate his culpability.  I regard the prisoner as
he is as a danger.
 The evidence does not persuade me that the prisoner will
remain a danger forever or remain beyond rehabilitation.  The unchallenged
psychiatric evidence does cause me to be persuaded that the sentence the Crown
submits should be passed is not the appropriate answer
to the problem for the
following reasons.
<P>

77	The courts have remained aware of the terrible significance of a sentence of
life imprisonment.  The Crown has provided me with
a schedule of sentences for
murders occurring in highly emotional circumstances and often with preceding
offences.  The life sentence
or indeed sentences of more than 18 years are
rarely imposed.  Courts have required extreme, eg. worst case culpability or
unacceptable
dangerousness to be proved for life sentences.
<P>

78	Judicial discussions of the life sentence have rarely examined the
inflexible sentence requiring the continued custody of the
offender for the
term of natural life and without prospect of release.  More usually, the
discussion deals with a life sentence in
which the institutional custody may be
determined to permit release on supervised conditional liberty for the rest of
life.
<P>

79	For the passing of the inflexible sentence of life, it has been held it is
not necessary that there should be no prospects of
rehabilitation or that the
crime is in the worst class of cases.  Either is sufficient, but in those
circumstances, for the crime
to be in the latter class, one where "the level of
culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and
punishment
can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty":<b>
Garforth</b> (supra), it must (as was submitted by the Crown) in order to
categorise any case as being in the worst case category (and so attracting
the
maximum prescribed penalty) be possible to point to particular features which
are of very great heinousness and the absence of
facts mitigating the
seriousness of the crime:<b> Twala</b> (supra).  In the former case, it must be
remembered that the law does not permit the imposition of a sentence of
preventative detention
but the very nature of this crime and a postulated lack
of prospects of rehabilitation means one is dealing with an offender with
a
real and high dangerous potential. However, danger to the community has to be
assessed as countervailing other factors (<b>Veen (No. 2)</b> (supra)).  It is
necessary to look to the danger in the context of protection of the community
and thus because of custodial restraints,
supervision and treatment, the time
of possible release is the time of greatest concern.
<P>

80	Recently, the High Court in <b>Mitchell v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 333</a>
at 346-347 considered the appropriateness of sentences of "strict security life
imprisonment" with the possibility of parole as appropriate
under Western
Australian legislation.  The Court of Criminal Appeal had held that there was
an overriding factor of risk to the community
and said that it was necessary
for the court to act on a footing established in the evidence that there was at
least some potential
for rehabilitation when assessing the balance to be struck
between the circumstances of the offence and the factors militating in
favour
of the possibility of parole, including whether the more general and objective
factors relating to punishment outweighed the
potential of the appellant to be
rehabilitated through the medium of parole.  The High Court, however,
considered that the trial
judge correctly had regard to the possibility of the
later emergence of facts, presently unascertainable, but which might emerge
about 20 years or more hence, which might then indicate that the appellant no
longer constitutes a danger to the public and is otherwise
deserving of release
on licence.  I bear this in mind.
<P>

81	I also bear in mind what the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of
Victoria in <b>The Queen v. Pickard</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/1998/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) VSCA 50</a> (28 September 1998) in
the judgment of the President and Charles, JA., said:-
<P>

	"Almost every day sentencing judges assess and balance risks of re-offending
and prospects of reform as part of the intuitive process
of sentencing without
the need to articulate their findings in terms of standards of proof.  But if
there is a dispute and the judge
resolves it adversely to the interests of the
accused by assessing the risk of re-offending to be such as to warrant an
aggravation
of penalty then the judge must be satisfied of the existence of
such an aggravating factor according to the standard of which the
majority
spoke in <b>R. v. Storey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20VR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 VR 359</a> at 371. With great respect, we do
not agree with Callaway, JA. that their Honours in the majority in
<b>Storey</b> were speaking in their judgment only of what his Honour calls
sentencing facts, or that the principles laid down were not intended
to apply
to such matters as a likelihood of re-offending or prospects of rehabilitation.
Both of these matters were in our view clearly
adverted to in the majority
judgment at 365-366, in a lengthy passage which included reference on three
occasions to the sentencing
issue, whether the prisoner's condition (or
personality) was such that he or she might be a danger to the community.
<P>

	An assessment by the judge of the risk of a prisoner re-offending is not a
feat which requires any refinement of thought process.
 If the judge is
satisfied that the accused constitutes such a risk that the penalty to be
imposed should reflect an aspect of specific
deterrence, it will be because he
or she has no doubt that the accused poses such a risk.  In our view, it is not
a question of distinguishing
between degrees of risk.  It is simply because the
judge perceives that the risk is such that the penalty should be one which will
deter the accused from re-offending.  The greater the judge perceives the risk
to be, the more heavily specific deterrence will weigh
in the instinctive
decision as to the appropriate sentence.  This says no more than the majority
decided in <b>Storey's</b> case (supra)."
<P>

82	As was the trial judge in <b>Twala</b> (supra), and as I have already noted,
I am entirely sceptical of the prisoner objectively being remorseful.  He no
doubt feels and
expresses immense loss and sorrow from time to time but I,
cannot escape the impression created in part by his own letters to the
deceased's family and in part by the psychiatric evidence, that what he feels
is a self-centred sorrow for his self-created lot and
loss.  I am greatly
concerned at the prospect of any early release of this prisoner back into the
community where he might repeat
the cycle of emotional dependence, grievance
and retaliation.
<P>

83	This, like the crime in <b>Twala</b> (supra) was a violent and horrible
killing, clearly influenced by the prisoner's psychological condition and the
dependence by him
on his wife.  In this matter, unlike <b>Twala</b> (supra), I
do not conclude that there was a prior intention determined on to kill or
injure the victim.
<P>

84	In considering whether to impose the life sentence or a determinate sentence
with a lengthy component that must be spent in custody,
coupled with a lengthy
period within which the prisoner might, if considered suitable, be released
under supervision, I have specific
regard to what was said (concerning a
determinate sentence) by the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>Twala</b>
(supra):-
<P>

	"In determining the sentence it is important also to bear in mind that the
setting by the sentencing court of a minimum term does
not produce the result
that the prisoner will automatically be released at the conclusion of that
period.  It will then become a
question for the Offenders Review Board to
determine whether he is fit to be released and on what conditions.  In making
that determination,
many years into the future, the Board will have the
advantage of up-to-date psychiatric assessments as well as a great deal of
hindsight
not presently available to this court."
<P>

85	Those observations have particular significance in the light of the
observations I refer to above from the High Court in <b>Mitchell</b> (supra)
and the Victorian Court of Appeal in <b>Pickard</b> (supra).
<P>

86	The evidence before me does satisfy me that the prisoner at present
represents a real danger in the community were he to be released
and therefore
able to have resort to the abuse of substances with which his life has hitherto
been accompanied.  Were he to be subject
to emotional stress arising from a
relationship, it seems to me he might represent a real danger to a loved one.
However, the sentence
that I am minded to pass and the non-parole period is of
such duration that it appears to me that consistent with what has been said
in
those cases an appropriate synthesis of the various principles I have referred
to can be achieved.
<P>

87	I am unable to conclude that there is an absence of real prospects of
eventual rehabilitation.  As the prisoner ages, I do conclude
that appropriate
treatment has a prospect to assist to modify his behaviour and relieve his
condition.  I accept that the prisoner
is prepared whilst in custody to work
towards that rehabilitation but I endorse the views expressed by the
psychiatrists that he
should not be released, without having been subject
whilst in custody and whilst on parole, to appropriate mechanisms to minimise
any prospect of re-offending.  It would, of course, be imperative that if he is
to be released on parole it should only be done subject
to some such
mechanisms.
<P>

88	Having regard to the objective circumstances of the crime, the prior offence
and the outrage to the community such a crime occasions,
further having regard
to the necessity to protect the community through ensuring the rehabilitation
and deterrence of this offender
as well as others, and having regard to the
prisoner's age and psychological circumstances, I am of the view that the
circumstances
of this offence, in which I include the prisoner's vulnerability
to stressors inducing violence, a lack of control such as to negate
the effects
of conditional liberty and any emotional restraint (as evidenced in both this
and the prior matter), the susceptibility
to substance abuse;  and further
having regard to the necessity for a lengthy period of time to enable the
necessary effects by way
of rehabilitation and deterrence to occur, I consider
that the prisoner should spend in custody at least the period of 20 years.
<P>

89	I am of the view, therefore, that the prisoner should be sentenced to a
minimum term of imprisonment of 20 years to date from
26 May 1997.
<P>

90	Bearing in mind what I have said concerning the prisoner's addictions,
psychological make up, the length of time he will be in
custody and what it is
envisaged he might need in custody for rehabilitation and for personal
deterrent to operate in the context
of his personality disorder, I am of the
view that there should be an additional term exceeding one-third of the minimum
term.  I
am of that view on the basis that these matters constitute special
circumstances.  There will be for those reasons an additional
term of 10 years
during which the prisoner may remain in custody but during which it would be
open to the prisoner to be released
into the community under supervision.
<P>

91	David Samuel Barac, you have pleaded guilty to the murder of Helen Cusack.
For that crime you are sentenced to penal servitude
for 30 years.  That
sentence comprises a minimum term of 20 years which, I direct to commence on 26
May 1997 and which will expire
on 25 May 2017 together with an additional term
thereafter of 10 years, expiring on 25 May 2027.  The earliest date upon which
you
will be eligible for release on parole is 25 May 2017.
<P>

92	The effect of this sentence will be that you will remain in custody for at
least the 20 years I have referred to but may be allowed
to be released during
the subsequent 10 years.  If so, you will be allowed your liberty only subject
to supervision and only in the
event that the proper authorities reach the view
that your release might appropriately be ordered.
<P>
