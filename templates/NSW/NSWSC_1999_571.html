<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>WEDNESDAY 2 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1144/99 - RE INTAG INTERNATIONAL LTD &amp; THE CORPORATIONS LAW</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an application under s 436B(2) of the
Corporations Law for leave for the liquidator to be appointed administrator.
<P>

2	The liquidator was appointed by the court, it would appear, in the random
manner in which A List liquidators are appointed on
a summons to wind up on
insolvency.  The liquidator's appointment was made on 22 March 1999.
<P>

3	The liquidator has worked on the accounts of the company in order to see the
best return for the unsecured creditors. That has
been a difficult matter
because the assets are intellectual property and other intangibles located
offshore which are hard to value.
 He has however arranged for a "deal" to be
made with a company that is willing to pay a sum of $1 million, provided that
the company
goes into administration.
<P>

4	When the matter was brought before me this morning, today being Wednesday, I
was as suspicious as I normally am of a company application
that is brought
hurriedly otherwise than on a Monday, because unless matters are very urgent
they should be brought before the Company
Judge on a Monday because they can be
dealt with there much more efficiently than in the Duty Judge's List.  However,
I was assured
that the matter was very urgent and I have considered it during
the day.
<P>

5	I considered the purpose of the section in<b> Re Depsun Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20644" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13
ACSR 644</a> and there reached the view that it was necessary at this stage to
consider matters of  public interest, and so the court not only
considers the
mechanical matter of whether there should be leave for the same person to act
as liquidator and administrator, but
also what is the purpose of going into
administration and whether in due course there is a fair prospect of the
company coming out
of liquidation.
<P>

6	There have been decisions on the section since, but I do not believe that in
general they have departed from that view.  In other
words, the same sort of
enquiry is made as when one is considering whether to adjourn a winding up
application upon an administrator
being appointed; see eg <b>Waste Recycling
and Processing Services of NSW v Local Government Recycling Co-operative</b>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/507.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 507.</a>
<P>

7	Essentially, the court when considering these applications looks at the
following matters:   (a) is the company insolvent?  (b)
if it is insolvent can
it be salvaged?  (c) if it can be salvaged is the proposed scheme for salvation
prima facie one that will
benefit the creditors? and (d)  is the proposed
scheme contrary to the  public interest?
<P>

8	When I first looked at the figures this morning, doubtless because of the
small amount of time that was given to prepare, I was
not satisfied of these
matters.
<P>

9	Having heard oral evidence from the liquidator this afternoon it would seem
that the answer to the first three questions is yes
and that on the information
available at this stage the scheme passes the fourth test as well.
<P>

10	However, as the liquidator mentioned in the witness box, these matters will
need to be reconsidered at the time when the proposed
deed of arrangement is
settled and when an application is made to the court to terminate the winding
up.  It is useful to know and
it should be part of the evidence in every one of
these cases that the liquidator has turned his mind to these matters, as I am
satisfied
this liquidator has.
<P>

11	Accordingly, I will make the order asked in the motion, that is order 2 of
the notice of motion of 2 June 1999.  The costs of
the application are to be
costs in the winding up. However, this order is not in anyway to preclude the
judge who finally hears the
application to stay the winding up assessing from
scratch the question as to whether the arrangement is in the public
interest.
<P>

                                                                    oOo
