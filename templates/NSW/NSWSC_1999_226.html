<P>

<b>KIRBY J</b>
<P>

<b>Thursday 18 March 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>REGINA  v  Anthony Stuart MOFFATT [No 2]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (on admissibility of ERISP - MFI 4)</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In this matter an application has been made on behalf of
the accused resisting the tender of the record of interview video and
accompanying
transcript, which is generally known as the ERISP interview, MFI
4.
<P>

2	The basis of the challenge is ss 135 and 137 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, and the
discretion which those sections give me to exclude evidence in certain
circumstances.
<P>

3	Section 135 provides that the Court may refuse to admit evidence if its
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger
that the evidence
might do various things, relevantly be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or be
misleading or confusing.
<P>

4	Section 137 provides that, in criminal proceedings, a Court may refuse to
admit evidence adduced by a prosecutor if its probative
value is outweighed by
the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.
<P>

5	In the course of these proceedings, the video tape has been shown, and I have
had the opportunity of examining the transcript.
 Dr Perl, a pharmacologist who
has expertise in the area of persons affected by alcohol and their responses,
has given evidence,
as has Dr Wong and others, concerning their reaction to the
record of interview.
<P>

6	It appears plain that, at the time of the interview, the accused was affected
by alcohol and that, at approximately 8am, when
a blood sample was taken, he
was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.18 grams per 100 millilitres of
blood.  Working back, one
can estimate the level of intoxication at 6.15am,
when the interview began. It was of the order of 0.2 to 0.23.  By ordinary
standards,
that is a significant level of alcohol.
<P>

7	However, the accused is not a person to be measured by ordinary standards.
It is common ground that the accused is, or was at
the time of the alleged
offence, a person with a long history of alcoholism who had developed
significant tolerance to alcohol. 
Dr Perl formed the view that his responses
to the interview were lucid and rational, and that the answers he provided were
responsive
to the questions that had been asked.
<P>

8	Dr Wong formed the same view.  Indeed, Dr Wong drew attention to a number of
aspects of the interview where, for instance in question
23, the accused sought
clarification of what was meant, and demonstrated in question 86, that he was
prepared to disagree with what
was being put to him.  In question 27 he
anticipated correctly certain questions that  were to be put to him.  The
general impression
from the interview is of someone who understood what was
being put and who responded appropriately.  There is a deal of internal
consistency in the answers provided at different stages of the interview to
similar questions.
<P>

9	Quite apart from this, other evidence has been given which would tend to
corroborate aspects of what is said in the interview.
 The Crown has mentioned
some of them in address;  namely, the presence of a broken mirror in the flat,
the presence of a hammer,
a claw hammer, which was recovered from the flat and
later shown to the accused in the interview, the fact that the accused refers
to having heard a lot of cracks, including specifically, a crack of the neck,
and the autopsy having revealed broken ribs and a fracture
to the larynx.
<P>

10	It seems to me, therefore, that there is certainly probative value in the
record of interview.  The issue is whether or not its
admission, given that
value, is unfairly prejudicial to the accused, or whether it is likely to
mislead or confuse, or that its probative
value is outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice to Mr Moffatt.
<P>

11	It seems to me that, confining myself to s 135, the probative value is not
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice
to the accused, and
it cannot be said that the interview is either misleading or confusing.
Similarly, in respect of s 137, I do
not believe that its probative value is
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and, therefore, I
propose to
admit the interview and the transcript which accompanies it.
