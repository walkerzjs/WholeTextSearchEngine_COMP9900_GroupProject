<b>JUDGMENT  (On Defendant's Notice of Motion (26.2.1999) to set aside four
Notices to Produce served by Plaintiff)</b>
<P>

1	Four Notices to Produce are the subject of consideration.
<P>

2	The first (NP1), dated 22 February 1999, is concerned with what I will
describe as the confidentiality of the identity of defendant's
witnesses (NP1 -
<i>confidentiality</i>).
<P>

3	The second Notice to Produce (NP2), dated 23 February 1999, is concerned in
general terms with what I will describe as "<i>adjournment</i>" (NP2 -
<i>adjournment</i>).
<P>

4	The third Notice to Produce (NP3), dated 24 February 1999, is concerned with
what I will describe as "<i>witness statements</i>" (NP3 - <i>witness
statements</i>).
<P>

5	The fourth Notice to Produce (NP4), dated 23 February 1999, is concerned with
what I will in short hand describe as "<i>subpoena to police" </i>(NP4 -
<i>subpoena to police</i>).
<P>

	<b>The Procedural Context</b>
<P>

6	It is submitted by the plaintiff that NP2, NP3 and NP4 have been served in
connection with an application by the defendant to
amend the particulars of its
Defence.  This application is the subject of a Notice of Motion filed on 18
February 1999.  NP1 (<i>confidentiality</i>) relates to what was described in
the course of submissions as an application to the effect that someone will
make with respect to
the order I made on 20 November 1998 (DLJ:  6).  To this I
shall return.
<P>

	<b>The Legal Principles</b>
<P>

7	In the course of submissions for the defendant, Mr Wheelhouse referred me to
the classic statements of principle in the judgment
of Jordan CJ in the
<b><i>Commissioner for Railways v Small</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1938/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] NSWStRp 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2038%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564</a> at
573-4.  I will not repeat them.  I was also referred to the decision of the
Court of Appeal in <b><i>National Employer's Mutual General Association Limited
v Waind &amp; Hill</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NSWLR 372</a> and the judgment of Moffitt P at
381-2 and 383B-C, 384C.  With respect to the use in a Notice to Produce of an
expression such as
"<i>relating to</i>" I was referred to the decision of
Waddell J in <b><i>Spencer Motors Pty Limited v LNC Industries Limited </i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20921" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 921</a> at 929F, 930D.  Also cited was the decision of Powell J (as
he then was) in <b><i>Botany Bay Instrumentation &amp; Control Pty Limited
&amp; Anor v Stuart &amp; Anor </i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%203%20NSWLR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 3 NSWLR 98</a> and <b><i>Trade
Practices Commission v Arnotts Limited &amp; Anors</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/248.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 248</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2088%20ALR%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 88 ALR 90</a>,
Beaumont J at 103.20.  
<P>

8	Bearing in mind the principles set out in the above decisions and
particularly the first three, I turn to the respective Notices
to Produce.
<P>

9	I shall deal with <b>NP2</b> (<i>adjournment)</i>.  This was described as a
"<i>dragnet"</i> Notice to Produce which in its first paragraph calls for the
production of <i>"all documents</i>" (which is defined) "<i>recording any part
of the substance of any communication between the solicitors and counsel for
the defendant"</i>.  Pausing there, it was submitted that this immediately
pointed to the production of documents that would be the subject of a claim
for
legal professional privilege.  The fact that documents that may be produced
under a Notice to Produce would be the subject of
such a claim merely points to
an issue to be separately dealt with upon production rather than as a basis for
setting aside the Notice
to Produce.
<P>

10	The extract just cited from the first paragraph is rather cumbersome in its
language but Mr McHugh for the plaintiff was at pains
to point out that it was
to be seen to focus upon a part of a communication between the parties referred
to and the substance of
that part so as to obviate the recipient of the Notice
declining to produce a communication which may contain matters that are not
"<i>caught</i>" by the Notice to Produce itself (or possibly would be the
subject of a subsequent claim for privilege).
<P>

11	The Notice requires documents of the kind referred to "<i>relating to"
</i>either of:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	any application by either party (whether made or contemplated) to be
made on or after 8 February 1999 that these proceeding be
adjourned.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The possibility that these proceedings might be adjourned on or after 8
February 1999".</i>
<P>

12	The second paragraph of the Notice to Produce calls for all documents
<i>"relating to</i>":
<P>

	<i>"(a)	any application by either party (whether made or contemplated) to be
made on or after 8 February 1999 that these proceedings
be adjourned.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The possibility that these proceedings might be adjourned on or after 8
February 1999".</i>
<P>

13	No point was taken in relation to paragraph 2 as to the ambiguity of the
reference "<i>to either party"</i> in sub-paragraph (a).  
<P>

14	The purpose of the issue of this Notice was made clear for the plaintiff:
it is to elicit documents for the purposes of the defendant's
application to
amend with a view to establishing that the applications to amend are being made
with the objective of having the proceedings
adjourned, that is to thwart the
hearing of the plaintiff's actions.
<P>

15	The foundation outlined for the plaintiff is an extraordinary one.  Upon
expedition being granted for the hearing of these actions
(5 May 1998, DLJ: 2)
there has been one substantive application for an adjournment, namely on 23
October 1998 (DLJ:  5) and that
was for a three day adjournment during the
trial.  There had been informal discussions as to the fixing of the hearing to
commence
at the beginning of term with a view to deferring that which was the
subject of the ruling on 18 September 1998 (DLJ:  4)<i>.</i>  There has, of
course, been no application for an adjournment of the hearing, save for the
three day adjournment to which I have
referred.  The matter was fixed for
directions in the week commencing 1 February 1999 with a view to the actual
hearing commencing
on 8 February 1999 (in a triumph of case and hearing
management a jury was empanelled on 22 February 1999 and answered the questions
left to it on 25 February 1999).
<P>

16	It has been stated by the defendant through its counsel that it is not the
intention of the defendant, by seeking to amend its
Defence, deliberately to
prevent the hearing of the action or delay its commencement.  "<i>Delay</i>"
may be a consideration in the determination of whether or not leave to amend
will be granted (although even this is in issue - see
my judgment of 10
February 1999 DLJT: 5 paragraphs 11 and 12).
<P>

17	Merely because a Notice to Produce can be described as "<i>wide</i>" in its
terms (if its terms can be understood), that does not necessarily bring it
about that the Notice to Produce is set aside.
 It has to be oppressive to the
point of being an abuse of process of the Court.  There is certainly ambiguity,
in my view, in this
Notice to Produce as to "<i>either party</i>":  if it
refers to solicitors and counsel as the two parties encompassed by that phrase,
that is one thing, if refers to the plaintiff
and the defendant that is
certainly another.  Furthermore, upon 8 February having been fixed for hearing
in the latter part of 1998,
the plaintiff would be entitled to more
particularity in terms of time frame in respect of the contemplation of an
actual application
for an adjournment of that date or the "<i>possibility</i>"
thereof.  However, the foundation of relevance being the "<i>motive</i>" in the
defendant asserted on behalf of the plaintiff in response to the defendant's
motion to set aside the Notice to Produce, in
the absence of any material that
would support such a position on the part of the plaintiff compels, in my view,
the setting aside
of this Notice, to which the description "<i>dragnet"</i>
otherwise is appropriate.
<P>

18	As to <b>NP3</b> (<i>witness statements</i>), my understanding of the
position is that the persons referred to in the Notice have made statements to
the police to which the
plaintiff has had access by reason of access being
granted to documents produced on subpoena by the police and also by reason of
the production by the defendant to the plaintiff of a folder of such statements
accompanying an affidavit recently filed by the solicitor
for the defendant.

<P>

19	It is contended for the defendant that this Notice to Produce is a
<i>"pre-emptive strike</i>" in the sense that it can be made the term of any
grant of leave to amend the case the defendant proposes to litigate in
justification
of the found imputations or contextual imputations that proofs of
evidence be provided.
<P>

20	It is argued for the defendant that the plaintiff has failed to specify with
precision, or to address with precision, the persons
to whom any of the
statements were made and in any event, seeks to cut across the process for
later determination namely, whether
or not leave should be granted and any
terms that would apply to such grant of leave.
<P>

21	Any question of privilege can be dealt with upon production of any documents
held.  I am not persuaded that this Notice to Produce
is defective in form and
will order compliance with it save for the production by the defendant of
police statements already provided
by the defendant to the plaintiff or known
to have been provided by the police service in answer to the subpoena.  I add
that any
claim for privilege must be supported by appropriate evidence.
<P>

22	I turn to <b>NP4</b> (<i>police subpoena</i>).  This is an extraordinary
Notice to Produce delivered in circumstances described by the plaintiff where
apparently there had some
"<i>turn around</i>" by the police in relation to
claims for public interest immunity on the one hand, and full compliance with
the subpoena dated 18
January 1999 issued by the defendant, on the other, and
an assertion made that the police service has taken a less than impartial
view
as between the plaintiff and the defendant, in some way, by complying with the
order of the Court constituted by the subpoena.
 
<P>

23	It is relevant to the overall question of amendment of the Defence and the
matter of delay and it is put that any claim for privilege
in respect of any
document "<i>caught</i>" by the Notice to Produce can be dealt with by an
application supported by evidence.
<P>

24	The question whether or not this particular Notice to Produce be set aside
was clouded rather than clarified by other matters
not the least of which is a
Notice of Motion which has been filed by the plaintiff to set aside the
subpoena itself.  This Notice
of Motion has yet to be dealt with.  The present
situation, however, is that this subpoena was issued, served and complied with
and
both parties have had access to the documents produced by the police
service without any objection by that service.  Further, an
affidavit has been
filed in support of the defendant's application to amend by Mr Ian Angus (19
February 1999) sworn on 18 February
1999 to which there is annexed some
correspondence between the solicitors for the defendant and the Police Service.
This affidavit
has not formally been read in the defendant's application to
amend proceedings.  I indicated to the parties however, that upon the
affidavit
being filed in Court and the accompanying documents being handed to me and in
anticipation of it being read and the application
for amendment proceeding I
had "<i>perused</i>" it but not the accompanying documents, being police
statements.  
<P>

25	Further, response to the objection to the Notice to Produce by the defendant
founded in considerations of oppression general
discovery and "<i>fishing</i>",
for the plaintiff it was argued, as to the last mentioned, that by reason of
certain statements made before Hulme J on 24 February
there were indications of
a "<i>fish in the pond</i>".
<P>

26	Apparently, in the course of the proceedings before Hulme J Mr Wheelhouse of
counsel for the defendant said (T5 line 15-22):

<P>

	<i>"The form of the subpoena came as a consequence, partly, of discussions
between the defendant's solicitors and the New South Wales
Police, in the face
of a position taken by the police in respect of an earlier subpoena;  namely,
that it was too wide for the police
to deal with and, on the basis that a
narrower form of subpoena be issued that the police could deal with, there
would be a response.
 That is evidentiary material I may, on instructions, wish
to put before the Court in relation to the results of the subpoena".</i>
<P>

27	This, I gather, is seized upon by the plaintiff as pointing to
communications between the defendant and the Police Service. 
This it clearly
does, to some extent, as well as pointing to an earlier subpoena in respect of
which, as I understand it, the Police
Service made a claim for public interest
immunity.
<P>

28	In response to the suggestion encapsulated in that part of the Notice to
Produce requiring the production of documents relating
to "<i>informal
production by the Police to the defendant of any documents identifying any
alleged victims of criminal sexual conduct by
the plaintiff"</i> and the
suggestion of partiality, the defendant sought to tender a series of documents
(which included some annexures to Mr Angus'
affidavit referred to), which
tender was rejected by me (see DLJT: 17 1 March 1999).
<P>

29	The Notice to Produce annexes a copy of the subpoena addressed to the Police
and issued on 18 January and which has been answered.
 In its first paragraph
the Notice requires any document, and using the infelicitous expression, in my
view, "<i>recording any part of the substance of any communication</i>" between
the defendant, its servant and agents, and the Police Service relating to (i)
the subpoena.
<P>

30	The Notice then goes on to require similar material in relation to any
subpoena issued or contemplated, informal production and
any disclosure by the
Police to the defendant of the identities of any alleged victims of criminal
sexual conduct by the plaintiff.
<P>

31	The second paragraph of the Notice deals with documents simply relating to
the police subpoena (as opposed to communications
between the defendant and the
police);  the third paragraph deals with all documents relating to (shortly
stated), any decision by
the defendant to request the issue of a subpoena to
the Police and the time of any such request to issue a subpoena to the police
was considered; the fourth paragraph, calls for the production of
communications between the solicitors and counsel for the defendant
relating to
whether any decision would be made to request the issue of any subpoena to the
Police and when such subpoena would be
issued.
<P>

32	The subpoena to the Police as in the form attached to the Notice to Produce
is in itself an extraordinarily wide document.  It
is one, however, which did
not apparently trouble the Police Service.  It has been answered.
<P>

33	It is to be noted that the subpoena to the Police requires the production of
documents to the Court in relation to investigations
carried out during the
period <i>"1990 to date</i>".  
<P>

34	The defendant defamed the plaintiff (as the jury found), in 1995 and 1996.
The Notice to Produce is in itself not limited in
terms of time otherwise than
by reference to the issue of the subpoena on 18 January and can be construed as
covering a period of
time by incorporation of that subpoena which includes a
period of four years before the institution of the present proceedings. 

<P>

35	It is clear that the defendant does not have to go through any judgment
making process in relation to the issue to which the
Police subpoena itself
relates;  it is clearly related to (in any sensible understanding of that
expression) the application to amend
the Defence of justification.  Be that as
it may, on reading the Notice to Produce as a whole it seems clear to me that,
as a whole,
it has the vice of being a call for general discovery.  On the
other hand, it is clear, especially from the statements made in open
Court
before Hulme J, that there were communications between the defendant and the
Police Service constituted by "<i>discussions</i>" as to "<i>at least</i>" the
"<i>width</i>" of the subpoena.  In my view, this eliminates any question of
"<i>fishin</i>g"<i> </i>in <i>that</i> regard and permits, even within the
defendant's camp, the identification of a class of communication of a discrete
nature.  This
class of documents, in my view, is incorporated in paragraph
1(a)(b) relating to (i) the Police subpoena.  Looking at it another
way, if
that component of the Notice to Produce is isolated the balance does
constitute, in my view, a request for general discovery.
<P>

36	Accordingly, I will require production of documents in accordance with
1(a)(b)(i) of the NP4.
<P>

37	I return to <b>NP1</b> which is not connected with the application to amend
the Defence but to the question of confidentiality.
<P>

38	In the course of submissions in support of the Notice to Produce said words
were said to the effect that at some stage there
would be an application by one
side or the other in relation to this issue.
<P>

39	The history of the "<i>confidentiality</i>" issue can be summarised thus:
by a Notice of Motion filed on 19 December 1996 the <i>plaintiff</i> sought an
order that the eighth order I made in a judgment dated 17 December 1996 be set
aside.  That order was in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>"By consent in matters 20223/95 and 20592/96 the names of, or any material
which may reasonably identify any persons referred to in
the defendant's
pleadings as D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9 and D10 are not to be published
to any person other than the plaintiff
through his counsel Mr G O'L Reynolds or
his solicitor Mr A F Crawford or Mr R Potter".</i>
<P>

40	On 20 November 1998 (DLJ:  6) I made orders on the motion of the
<i>defendant</i>.  The principle order, in the end, made after hearing of
argument was order 3:  "<i>until further order I direct that the names of D1,
D2, D3, D5 and D6 not be published in open Court".</i>  That order is still on
foot and has been extended, at least de facto, to the identity of further
witnesses the defendant says it
proposes to call in support of its plea of
justification as it presently stands or as it hopes to have it amended.
<P>

41	In the course of the series of interlocutory applications that have been
made since 1 February 1999 I have indicated to the parties
the desirability, of
there being on the Court record a formal process in relation to each such
application namely, a Notice of Motion
setting out precisely the orders each
party seeks in respect of whatever subject matter is of concern.  This
generally has been complied
with.
<P>

42	There is presently on foot no application by one side or the other in
relation to confidentiality.  A presently available view
is that presumably the
defendant will require some order as to confidentiality and the plaintiff will
oppose any such order.  But
the order made by me on 20 November 1998 still
stands, <i>"until further order</i>" and no one has sought any such "<i>further
order</i>".  This issue is inchoate.  NP1 relates to no current proceedings and
on that basis I will set it aside.
<P>

43	The question of <i>confidentiality</i> as I have called it will have to be
decided and sooner rather than later.
<P>

44	Whichever party seeks to have this matter resolved will have to move the
Court accordingly.  I can see that considerations may
be different in relation
to particular witnesses.  Equally can I see that there may be an argument
available on a general basis that
no such order should be made in civil
proceedings of this kind.  But until such an application is discretely made,
the present NP1
is irrelevant.
<P>

45	I note in passing that the Notice NP1 refers to "<i>confidentiality</i>
<i>orders</i>" or "<i>undertakings</i>";  <i>"pseudonym orders" </i>or
<i>"undertakings</i>";  "<i>the question whether or not the names ... should be
mentioned in Court ..."</i>;  "<i>the concealment of the identity of ..."</i>;
<i>"the hearing of either of these proceedings in camera</i>".  The source of
these various categories is uncertain:  the pseudonym, for example, D6, was
allocated in order to preserve the confidentiality
of the identity of that
person.  All the concepts one would have thought were arguably synonymous.
<P>

46	NP1 will set aside.
<P>

47	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Notice to Produce (NP1) dated 22 February 1999 is set aside.
<P>

2.	Notice to Produce (NP2) dated 23 February 1999 is set aside.
<P>

3.	As to Notice to Produce (NP3) dated 24 February 1999 the defendant is to
comply therewith save for the production of statements
to the police of the
persons named in NP3 and which statements have either been delivered by the
defendant to the plaintiff or inspected
by the plaintiff upon production to the
Court by the New South Wales Police Service.
<P>

4.	As to Notice to Produce (NP4) dated 23 February 1999 the defendant is to
comply with paragraph 1(a)(b)(i) only.  The balance
of the Notice to Produce is
set aside.
