<b>JUDGMENT - ON APPLICATION TO ALLOW FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION OF MR HOGARTH
BY EITHER MR OFFICER QC OR MR POWELL OF COUNSEL;  SEE PAGE
405 OF THE
TRANSCRIPT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: There are presently before the Court several
sets of related proceedings being heard together concerning dealings
between
the parties relating to extensive land holdings at Helensburgh in New South
Wales. Those dealings led to the creation of
a joint venture relationship under
a written heads of agreement document executed between 11 November and 1
December, 1993 pursuant
to which an agreement called the 'Helensburgh Unit
Trust Holders Agreement', dated 6 April, 1994 was entered into.
<P>

2   	Central to the disputes between the parties at a factual
level are circumstances in which attempts were made to secure the
rezoning of
the Helensburgh lands so as to allow a substantial portion thereof to be
developed as a residential subdivision. A principal
claim to relief pursued by
the plaintiffs arises by reason of the failure of attempts to secure the
rezoning of the subject land.
The summons and other pleadings identify a number
of other claims to relief and defences to those claims.
<P>

3   	It is not presently appropriate to outline the particular
issues raised by the pleadings save to recognise that the plaintiffs
rely upon
a number of causes of action including rectification claims, claims to the
existence of implied terms, a representational
case, a case relying upon
alleged fiduciary obligations, and claims to breaches of statutory duty.
<P>

4   	It is also appropriate to recognise, as is not
controversial, that a large number of complex statements have been filed and/or
are sought to be relied upon by the respective parties. In the case of Mr
Hogarth, who is the principal lay witness sought to be
called on behalf of the
plaintiffs, his first statement of late December 1998 runs for one hundred and
sixty-one paragraphs, over
a hundred pages.  In some cases conversations which
Mr Hogarth gives evidence of in that statement run to many many pages in each
instance and in the first person.
<P>

5   	The defendants' application presently before the Court
arises in circumstances of the announced intent of Mr Shand QC, leading
counsel
for the defendants, to shortly depart from the case.  As recorded at transcript
page 269, the application is `to allow further
cross-examination of Mr Hogarth
by either of Mr Officer QC or Mr Powell of Counsel on areas and materials
previously not covered
by the cross-examination of Mr Shand'.
<P>

6   	That application has been clarified to the extent that it
is not proposed that both of Mr Officer QC and Mr Powell be entitled
to
continue the cross-examination.  The application is for only one of Mr Officer
QC or Mr Powell to be permitted to continue the
cross-examination.
<P>

7   	The application has been brought forward informally by
agreement with the bases of the application at a factual level being
stated
from the bar table.  Subject to qualification on some interrogation by Mr
Ellicott of Senior Council for the plaintiffs, those
bases have been accepted
as to the facts which are not in contention.
<P>

8   	Essentially the matters of fact which the defendant relies
upon in relation to the application are these: First, as from 22
October 1999
or shortly thereafter, Mr Shand will be unavailable to appear in this or any
other case for medical reasons and will
be so unavailable until the end of
1999.  That matter is accepted by Mr Ellicott as a given for the purposes of
the contested application.
<P>

9   	Secondly that prior to the commencement of the hearing on
21 September 1999 (not 20 September 1999 - 20 September having originally
been
the date fixed for commencement of the hearing but that date having been
vacated in circumstances to be later referred to in
the judgment), the
defendants' solicitors were aware that Mr Shand would not be available after 22
October 1999 for those medical
reasons.
<P>

10   	In relation to that stated matter of fact, Mr Ellicott
enquired as to when Mr Shand was briefed, to be informed that Mr Shand
was
briefed on 11 August 1999 Mr Ellicott also  enquired as to whether or not at
the time when Mr Shand was briefed, he then informed
his instructing solicitors
that he would not be available on and after 22 October 1999.  At transcript
page 274 Mr Shand accepted
that that was the case.
<P>

11   	Thirdly that prior to the commencement of the hearing on
21 September 1999, Mr Shand was of the view that his cross-examination
of Mr
Hogarth would be lengthy and that the cross-examination would easily be
concluded in the period between commencement of the
hearing and 22 October
1999.
<P>

12   	In that regard, at transcript page 276 Mr Ellicott
elicited, and I proceed upon the basis, that insofar as Mr Shand's view
that
the cross-examination would easily conclude in the period between commencement
of the hearing and 22 October, Mr Shand formed
that view based on the
proposition that, the Court would be sitting from the commencement of the
hearing to 22 October without the
breaks which the Court has had and which will
later be referred to in the judgment.
<P>

13   	It is necessary to traverse in some detail the precise
days on which the Court has been sitting following commencement of
the hearing,
the reasons why the Court did not sit on certain days, and the dates when the
parties agreed, or the Court directed
that the Court would not sit.
<P>

14   	Save for one or two areas of some slight uncertainty, I do
not understand either party to take exception with the following
general
statement of fact.  I proceed to set out what I understand generally to be the
matrix against which the application is to
be adjudicated.
<P>

15   	The proceedings were fixed for hearing in February or
March 1999.  They were, the Court has been informed, set down for approximately
six weeks.
<P>

16   	The proceedings were fixed to commence on Monday, 20
September 1999.
<P>

17   	On or about 13 September 1999 Rolfe J, who is the
Commercial List Judge, determined that I would be hearing these proceedings.
The parties were informed of that fact on about 14 September 1999.
<P>

18   	The matter was in the applications list on 10 September on
an occasion when a question had arisen as to whether or not the
defendants may
wish to make an application were Rolfe J to have been the trial Judge.  The
parties were informed on that day that
no decision had yet been made as to who
the trial Judge would be.  It eventuated that there never had been any
possibility or concern,
as I understand it, but that Rolfe J could have heard
this case, although at some stage the defendants appeared to have been
concerned
that Rolfe J may have known Mr Hogarth.  As I presently understand
the position, Rolfe J does not know Mr Hogarth and the Mr Hogarth
whom Rolfe J
had at some stage mentioned he may have known, was certainly not Mr Hogarth who
is the plaintiffs' principal lay witness.
<P>

19   	As soon as I was notified that I would be hearing the
proceedings, the parties were informed.  The parties were so informed
on about
13 September.  It is likely that on 13 September or thereabouts I would have
made plain to the parties what my usual pre-trial
directions are and, to the
best of my recollection, that procedure followed in this case.
<P>

20   	Also on 13 September I informed the parties that the
proceedings would commence on the Tuesday and that the Court would not
sit
during the week of 4 October.  Those then are the precise facts which I accept,
there being a file note of Mr Ellicott's instructing
solicitor of the events of
13 September.
<P>

21   	On the same day, that is to say 13 September, the file
note records that I informed the parties that I expected that on 8
October,
Hunter J would resume the Construction List, but indicated that I would quite
likely not be able to hear the proceedings
on two Fridays, namely 24 September
and 1 October.
<P>

22   	In the event, as the parties are aware, I was unable to
give the parties any hearing time on either 24 September or 1 October,
being
otherwise on those days engaged in hearing Building and Construction List
matters, or Commercial List matters, in the respective
applications' lists.
<P>

23   	The Court did not sit during the week of 4 October.  The
cross-examination by Mr Shand of Mr Hogarth commenced on  Monday,
11 October.
It continued on Tuesday, 12 October, from 12.16pm; on Wednesday, 13 October;
and on Friday, 15 October, from 11.40am.
 It proceeded on Tuesday of this week,
19 October, and has proceeded this morning, Wednesday, 20 October.
<P>

24   	The parties had originally contemplated a view taking
place, which was to have taken place on 11 October, but for a reason
associated
with the unavailability of an expert wishing to participate on the view, the
date for fixing the view was changed from
11 October to 14 October.  The whole
of that day was taken with a view.
<P>

25   	When the proceedings on Friday, 15 October commenced at
about 11.40am, Mr Shand announced that he could not participate in
the case
beyond the end of this current week, and that substitute Queen's Counsel had
agreed to take over his role.  He indicated
that Mr Officer QC would become
leading counsel for the defendants and that he, Mr Shand, would not be able to
finish his cross-examination
by the end of this current week.  Mr Shand stated
that subject to there being no retracing of cross-examination steps taken by Mr
Shand, Mr Officer, subject to leave being granted at the discretion of the
Court, would seek to complete the cross-examination of
Mr Hogarth.
<P>

26   	It is then necessary to also recognise that there were, in
fact, had the Court sat every day between 20 September and 22 October,
not
including Monday, 4 October, which was a public holiday, some twenty-four days.
The defendants have pointed out that the non
sitting days have been ten days;
namely, 20 September, that is the day when the proceedings were first due to
commence; 24 September
and 1 October, when the Court was engaged in
applications in the Construction List and Commercial List; 4 to 8 October,
already referred
to; 14 October, the visit to Helensburgh; and 18 October,
which is the Monday of this last week.
<P>

27   	In relation to the 18 October situation, what occurred was
that the day was anticipated by the Court to be a full day continuance
of the
cross-examination.  As the transcript records, at the joint request of senior
counsel for both parties the Court stayed off
the Bench on Monday, 18 October.
The hearing was recommenced on the morning of Tuesday, 19 October, on the joint
application of the
parties.
<P>

28   	The opening addresses and sundry interlocutory motions
have taken some seven days; namely, the plaintiffs' opening address
21, 22, 23
and part of 27 September; the defendants' opening address part of 27 September
and 28, 29 and part of 30 September.  
Motions to set aside subpoenas were
heard during the balance of 30 September.
<P>

29   	The hearing of the application to permit cross-examination
by an additional counsel of Mr Hogarth in fact commenced during
the morning of
19 October.  As already stated, at that point in time it was correct to say
that Mr Hogarth's cross-examination had
taken some three days and approximately
36 minutes.  By the end of this week, when Mr Shand leaves this case, Mr
Hogarth's cross-examination
will have taken approximately six days.
<P>

30   	A further matter of fact which requires to be recognised
is that Mr Shand has been, as announced sometime ago, unavailable
to
cross-examine on Wednesday, Thursday and  Friday afternoon of this week.  That
unavailability is announced to the Court as by
reason of a personal and non
professional matter, namely a personal obligation related to another person's
health.  The defendants
have, through Mr Powell, stated that this could not
have been known to the defendants until recently.
<P>

31   	In relation to when Mr Shand first announced that he would
be unavailable on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon of this
week, to the
best of my recollection I was informed of that fact privately with Mr Ellicott
some little time ago.  I cannot be precise
on what day.  On whatever occasion,
I simply indicated that I would accede to whatever counsel jointly agreed and
would determine
any application which may be made where there was disagreement.
I accept that Mr Ellicott's recollection seems to be that it was
probably last
week that this matter was first raised in court by Mr Shand.
<P>

32   	In those circumstances the plaintiffs oppose the
application for leave to be granted for further cross-examination of Mr
Hogarth.
<P>

33   	In support of the application, Mr Powell submits that
there are special circumstances and these circumstances are put in this
fashion:  The first is suggested to be Mr Shand's unavailability for medical
reasons.  In short, Mr Powell submits that there is
a distinction to be made
between unavailability for this reason or unavailability by reason of a counsel
having an inconsistent commitment
by way of another court case, for example, or
another brief.
<P>

34   	The second of the suggested special circumstances relies
upon the amount of evidence which Mr Hogarth traverses in his statement
and in
statements which were only received by the defendants after the commencement of
the hearing.  In that regard the defendants
draw attention to the fact that
notwithstanding the directions with respect to statements, a statement of 3
October 1999 was received
by the defendants on 5 October 1999, this being a
statement said to be in reply by Mr Hogarth and covering some 103 pages. The
defendants
also rely upon a further statement filed in court on 11 October,
which is a shorter statement by Mr Hogarth seeking to make certain
amendments
to his statement in reply.
<P>

35   	The third suggested special circumstance is that, given
the issues and complexities of the case, the evidence that Mr Hogarth
has
given, and the content of the cross-examination when concluded by Mr Shand, the
cross-examination of Mr Officer, if it is permitted,
could not be said to have
been or be oppressive to Mr Hogarth.
<P>

36   	The final matter relied upon by the defendants is that in
the circumstances outlined in terms of the date history of the proceedings
"it
was reasonable for the legal advisers of the defendants to believe that the
cross-examination of Mr Hogarth would be concluded
in the period 20 September
to 22 October 1999" - transcript page 273.
<P>

37   	Mr Powell, in submission, has drawn the Court's attention
to the decision of Young J in<b> </b><i>GPI Leisure v Herdsman Investments No
3</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 15</a>, in particular to a passage at page 24, where his
Honour said:
<P>

<i>"I am quite sure that there is no hard and fast rule of law  or practice
which compels me to say that only Mr Hughes QC, as the senior
of the two
counsel, can cross-examine any particular witness.  This is because first, I do
not think there is such a rule other than
a guide to how a judge should
exercise his or her discretion, but also I do not think that strictly speaking
the present parties
can be said to be in identical interests as if they were
joint defendants.</i>
<P>

<i>In all the circumstances my view is that a fair trial will be assured in
accordance with the ruling that I have made, that Mr Hughes
and Mr Archibald
may agree between themselves who will go first in cross-examination, both may
cross-examine, but there is to be
no material overlapping in the
cross-examination of the senior counsel."</i>
<P>

38   	Mr Powell submits, and I accept, that the question is one
for exercise by the Court of its discretion and that the Court exercises
its
discretion in determining how to ensure that a fair trial will be assured.  Mr
Powell, as I understood it, accepted that there
are circumstances in which
cross-examination by more than one counsel can clearly be regarded as
oppressive.
<P>

39   	Mr Ellicott accepts that the principle is clear; namely,
that the Court's function is to administer justice between the parties
and in
carrying out that function, to be fair. Mr Ellicott submits that for this
reason the Court has, by and large, and subject
to special and/or exceptional
circumstances, generally turned its face against allowing more than one counsel
to cross-examine a
particular witness.  Mr Ellicott submits that those who wish
to have the Court exercise a discretion to permit more than one
cross-examination
must show that special circumstances exist.
<P>

40   	Mr Ellicott submits that the defendants knew of the
limitations on Mr Shand's time and availability to continue in this case
and
refrained from announcing that matter to the plaintiffs or to the Court until
last Friday.  That does seem to be a given circumstance
on my understanding of
the matrix of fact.
<P>

41   	Mr Ellicott submits that with their chosen Counsel the
defendants have pursued the cross-examination in the manner that they
saw fit,
and have used up generally Mr Shand's available time. Mr Ellicott submits that
the defendants could have informed the Court
and the plaintiffs of this
difficulty, and that for example it may have then been the case that no view
would have taken place on
the day when the view did take place. The submission
is that the problem which has now emerged must have been obvious, and must have
been obvious for some time.
<P>

42   	Mr Ellicott submits that this is not a case of a counsel
falling ill. Mr Ellicott submits that the Court cannot take into
account the
personal circumstances which the defendants assert require Mr Shand to be
absent from the court on Wednesday afternoon,
Thursday afternoon and Friday
afternoon of this week, that being, on Mr Ellicott's submission, not a material
matter.
<P>

43   	Mr Ellicott draws the Court's attention to a number of
authorities, and in particular in relation to one type of special circumstance,
the decision of Beach J in<b> </b><i>Eva Pty Limited v Charles Davis
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1982/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] VicRp 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20VR%20515" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) VR 515</a> where there were shown to be special circumstances to
permit departure from the established practice. In that case special
circumstances
accepted by the Court were that the magnitude and complexity of
the matters to be investigated in the various actions made it highly
improbable
that one counsel could so familiarise himself with every aspect of the issues
to be investigated so as to be able to adequately
prepare and conduct the
cross-examination of the principal witness in relation to those matters. His
Honour took also into account
the fact that the matters sought to be dealt with
by senior counsel were clearly defined, and did not overlap the other issues in
the actions which would result in no duplication of cross-examination provided
that junior counsel proposed to follow senior counsel
confined himself to those
specific issues.
<P>

44   	Mr Ellicott draws attention to the fact that when the case
was set down for hearing, the plaintiffs are said to have announced
as their
estimate of hearing time four weeks, and the defendants a six weeks estimate.
Mr Ellicott submits that on any view there
has been time in a six week case to
have had a six day cross-examination. His submission is that having regard to
the way in which
the cross-examination has been conducted, the Court should
hold that it would be oppressive for Mr Hogarth to be exposed to a further
cross-examination. Mr Ellicott further points out that whilst the terms of the
application are to allow further cross-examination
on areas and materials not
previously covered by Mr Shand in his cross-examination, a parameter of the
defendants' application is
to permit further cross-examination on credit. Mr
Ellicott's submission is that it will be impossible for Mr Officer or Mr
Powell,
depending on which of those members of the bar would cross-examine, to
keep out of issues of credit.
<P>

45   	Mr Ellicott draws particular attention to portions of the
judgment of Beach J appearing at page 517, lines 45, through to
518, line 14.
In those sections of Beach's J  judgment his Honour said:
<P>

<i>`There is then a reference to the decision of Doe v Roe <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1809/526.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1809] EngR 526</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281809%29%202%20Camp%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1809), 2 Camp. 280</a>;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=170%20ER%201155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">170 E.R. 1155</a> and I quote:  "There was two counsel for the plaintiff - the
junior having called the witness, who seemed disposed to shuffle and
prevaricate - the leader interposed and was proceeding to examine him.  Counsel
on the opposite side contended that this was irregular
and that although where
there were several counsel on the same side they might arrange among themselves
by whom the witnesses should
be examined yet that when the examination of a
witness was begun by one gentleman, the others had no right to put a question.
They
might privately suggest questions proper to be put but could not address
any directly to the witness.  If this rule were not adhered
to, a witness might
be subject to the examination or cross-examination of as many barristers as
were retained for the plaintiff or
defendant.  Much time would be wasted and
great confusion would be introduced into proceedings at nisi prius.
Ellenborough, Lord
C.J.:  `Convenience certainly requires that the examination
of a witness should be carried on entirely by the gentleman who begins
it and
several counsel clearly cannot be permitted to put questions to the same
witness, one after another, in the manner apprehended,
but, I think the leading
counsel has a right, in his discretion, to interpose and to take the
examination into his own hands - very
unpleasant consequences might follow if
this were not allowed.  If a gentleman, it being his first appearance in a
court of justice,
should be much embarrassed in the course of examining a
witness - it would be hard if it were in the power of the opposite party
to
prevent his leader from stepping in to his relief.  And other occasions may be
imagined when it may be very important that the
gentleman who conducts the
cause should have the privilege of putting questions to a witness originally
called by a co-adjuter. 
In the present state of the Bar there is no danger of
this privilege being abused'."</i>
<P>

<i>The passage in Wigmore, supra, continues:-</i>
<P>

<i>"This rule has been recognised in judicial rulings generally and also in a
few statutes doubtless also in many local rules of court.
 It is, of course,
subject to reasonable exceptions allowable in the trial court's discretion.
Moreover, it ought not to apply to
the examination of another witness nor of
the same witness at another stage or by a separate party in the same stage nor
to any process
but that of putting the questions to the witness."'</i>
<P>

46   	Mr Ellicott also draws attention to the reference by Beach
J to <i>Phillips v Phillips</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20NSWR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 NSWR 49</a> to be found at page 518 line
35 of the decision in Eva. Mr Ellicott also drew attention to the whole of the
judgment of Beach J.
One passage of the judgment of Beach J I note commencing
at page 519, line 6, includes an excerpt from the judgment of Alan J in<b>
</b><i>Phillips v Phillips</i><b> </b>where the Court had stated:
<P>

<i> `It is, I think, obvious, and as is made clear in the authorities to which
I have been referred, that there are many reasons why
this should prima facie
be adhered to.  It is true that in the particular case of an emergency, perhaps
through illness or other
event which renders it impracticable or undesirable in
the interests of justice, or, indeed, impossible, in the events which have
happened, for the same Counsel to continue his examination or cross-examination
that in such a case, the Court would allow any other
Counsel, properly briefed
and appearing in the proceedings, to assume the responsibility of continuing
the particular examination
or cross-examination, even though this be already
commenced and incomplete.  One only has to consider the circumstances of sudden
illness, loss of voice or other emergency which remove from the party's
representation the Counsel whom he or she had had up to that
point.  But it
does seem to me to require some particular occasion to justify this
situation."</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour then referred again to the case of Doe v. Roe, supra, and
continued:  "It will be seen therefore that this authority does
contain
suggestions to some extent in support of both Counsel but it seems to me that
it does support the proposition that there
should be, in a particular case,
some special circumstance sufficient to require the Court to allow a
proceeding, which is a departure
from established practice.  Long-established
practices are, I suppose, not likely to be departed from, yet, in the interests
of overall
justice, may on occasion have to be controlled and made amenable to
the exigencies of the occasion.'</i>
<P>

47   	Without being exhaustive in relation to Mr Ellicott's
submissions, he pointed out importantly, as he submitted, that the defendants
did not inform the plaintiffs or the Court of the problem, or looming problem
with Mr Shand's availability until very late in the
piece;  that in his
submissions it was not possible to severe in a fashion which would not be
oppressive to Mr Hogarth, the probable
topics for further cross-examination,
and that in the context of the case, and bearing in mind the mode of
cross-examination, on
Mr Ellicott's submission, the defendants have had
sufficient time to complete their cross-examination.
<P>

48   	Neither counsel took the Court to the precise head of
jurisdiction of the Court in exercising its undoubted discretion to
permit or
disallow further cross-examination by additional Counsel. That power may be
simply part of the inherent power of the Court.
There are presently two
particular sections of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> (1995) (NSW) which may well
apply. The first is section 11(1) which provides that `the power of a court to
control the conduct of
a proceeding is not affected by this Act, except so far
as the Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment'. The
second
section is section 26, which provides, inter alia,  that the Court may make
such orders as it considers just in relation to
the way in which witnesses are
to be questioned, and the presence and behaviour of any person in connection
with the questioning
of witnesses.
<P>

49   	In<b> </b><i>Hadid v Australis Media</i><b>,</b>
[unreported Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sperling J, 11 November 1996] his
Honour apparently dealt with an example of a situation
where the s 26 power
could be utilized, being a civil case where a number of parties had the same
interest.  Footnote 56 to Odgers
`<i>Uniform <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>'</i> Third Edition,
LBC Information Services, 1998, page 64 states that Sperling J considered that
the power in this regard derived from
section 11.  A copy of the judgment was
not available during argument or for assistance in relation to the delivery of
the ex tempore
judgment.
<P>

50   	For obvious reasons it is unnecessary for the Court to go
further into the question of the power of the Court in relation
to exercising
the discretion one way or another.
<P>

51   	To my mind, of some particular importance in relation to
the mode in which the Court's discretion should be exercised is the
fact that
the subject litigation is complex, involves claims to very large sums of money,
and involves very important claims in relation
to the credit of various
material witnesses. Additionally to be taken into account is  the fact that a
second amended summons was
propounded on 21 September, and a third amended
summons on 27 September.
<P>

52   	Importantly it seems to me, to be also included in the
Court's consideration of the subject application, is the matter of
the arrival
of the late statements by Mr Hogarth, particularly the 3 October 1999, one
hundred and three paragraph statement.
<P>

53   	Whilst the Court, during a conventional timetable leading
up to a hearing, endeavours to keep a level playing field by giving
directions
for the service of statements by particular dates, it is not uncommon for one
party or the other, during the hearing,
to seek to add to earlier statements,
whether by lay witnesses or by experts. This experience requires the Court to
adjudicate disputes
as and when they arise.  From time to time the Court
declines leave to rely upon late statements.  From time to time leave is
granted,
and sometimes, subject to conditions. In every circumstance it is my
understanding that the Court will adjudicate upon applications
for amendment of
a summons, or a defence, or a cross-claim, or a defence to cross-claim, and
will adjudicate an application for leave
to rely upon and file and read a late
statement on an instant specific basis. This requires the Court to inquire as
to possible prejudice
of the opposing party, and requires the Court to embark
upon a fairly delicate exercise of weighing in balance, at the same time
the
requirement that each party be permitted to have its full day in court, and the
requirement that there be no grave prejudice
to a party facing an application
for leave of the type referred to above.  A material factor is also the mode in
which the Commercial
List is administered.
<P>

54   	I have come to the clear conclusion in the present
circumstances that the application by the defendants for leave to further
cross-examine, but subject to constraints, should be allowed. I take into
account importantly the fact that Mr Powell of junior counsel
for the
defendants has been in court every day during the hearing up to this point in
time, and that it cannot be said that if Mr
Powell is to further cross-examine,
such further cross-examination would be without a very full and detailed
understanding of 
<P>

(a)	the whole of the course of both the addresses, 
<P>

(b)	the cross-examination to this point in time,
<P>

(c)	 the particular documents on which Mr Hogarth has cross-examined. 
<P>

55   	For the same reason, if Mr Officer is to conduct the
further cross-examination I would not permit that exercise in the absence
of Mr
Powell as his junior, for the reason that Mr Powell would know when and if
objections were taken by Mr Ellicott to a line of
cross-examination and
generally, when and how Mr Officer's questions may offend the obviously
important consideration that ground
already covered in cross-examination by Mr
Shand be not recovered. To my mind the constraints, the subject of the
application as
made, namely to allow further cross-examination by either one of
Mr Powell or Mr Officer QC, and on areas not previously covered
by Mr Shand,
are sufficient protection to the plaintiffs to avoid oppression in the
circumstances. When and if cross-examination
on particular areas of credit is
sought to be pursued by whichever counsel is to further cross-examine, the
Court will entertain,
depending as it arises, objections by the plaintiffs
should it appear that such cross-examination, by reason of that already carried
out by Mr Shand, is oppressive to Mr Hogarth.
<P>

56   	It is certainly the case that the Court's exercise of the
discretion in this case takes very much into account the voluminous
nature of
the statements put on by Mr Hogarth, and the voluminous nature of the materials
now before the Court subject in certain
cases to objections which may or may
not be pursued of Exhibits PX and DX.
<P>

57   	The type of case with which the Court is presently dealing
is beset with enumerable issues of fact, and enumerable subtle
issues of fact,
and enumerable issues of credit. In a real sense, one of the plaintiffs'
attempts in the case is to have the Court
determine as a matter of probability
what are the prospects that had the Commission of Inquiry into the Helensburgh
lands been conducted
to the mode in which it was conducted, the decision may
have been otherwise than in fact the decision was. That very circumstance
ought
make plain the unusual nature of these proceedings, and the fact that the Court
must strain to give each party, not only in
relation to cross-examination, but
in relation to calling of evidence, address, and generally the procedures which
the forensic entitlements
of the parties permit a full opportunity to each have
their day in court. Had Mr Hogarth been a minor witness in the scheme of
things,
the decision on discretion may have been very differently exercised. Mr
Hogarth, together with one or two other of the plaintiffs
witnesses, and
together with two or three possibly of the defendants' witnesses, are the
principal, as it were, lay witnesses who
give evidence in relation to
conversations and negotiations and communications which cover literary a number
of years.
<P>

58   	Finally, it is important to note that to my mind the fact
that the defendants have not informed the Court or the plaintiffs
of precisely
what are the areas which the new counsel will cross-examine upon ought not of
its own result in the application be dismissed.
That having been said, I have
taken account of the general estimate by Mr Powell and/or Mr Shand that it is
likely that the remaining
cross-examination will take approximately two days.
At the end of two days I will entertain a further application, if it is pursued
by Mr Ellicott, for the Court to then parenterally, regardless of the then
state of the cross-examination, to debar further cross-examination.
Again, any
such application will be determined on its then merits. But the Court
exercising its discretion in this fashion should
not be read by the defendants
as in any fashion permitting the defendants to traverse the same ground, or to
in effect have a second
attempt to cross-examine on areas not legitimately said
to be "materials or areas not previously covered by Mr Shand in his
cross-examination".
<P>

59   	For those reasons, I exercise the Court's discretion by
allowing the application in the terms in which it was made, and grant
leave to
the defendants to further cross-examine Mr Hogarth by either Mr Officer QC or
Mr Powell on areas and materials previously
not covered by the
cross-examination of Mr Shand, but permitting further cross-examination on
credit generally.
