<P>

<b>CRIMINAL DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>NEWMAN J</b>
<P>

<b><u>FRIDAY, 12 MARCH 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70013/98  -  REGINA  v  Rafael GAVRANOVIC</u></b>
<P>

<b>REASONS FOR VERDICT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Following an election made by the accused pursuant to s
32(1) of the <b>Criminal Procedure Act,</b> which election was consented to by
the Crown, Rafael Gavranovic was tried by myself, in the absence of a jury, for
the crime of murder.
<P>

2	He pleaded not guilty to that offence. While the factual material adduced by
the Crown in its case was uncontested by the accused,
he raised a defence of
mental illness. It is trite law that the onus of proving that defence is upon
the accused, the standard of
proof being the civil standard, namely, proof on a
balance of probabilities. I should add that in determining the Crown's factual
allegations, I have utilised the criminal standard, namely, proof beyond
reasonable doubt.
<P>

3	I turn then to the Crown case. The Crown alleged that the accused murdered
Jiri Zoufal, a Czech tourist, near Kings Cross on Saturday,
6 September 1997 at
around 7 pm. Shortly beforehand the late Mr Zoufal was observed by the accused
near Hyde Park. The accused thought
that at that time the deceased was staring
at him and when the deceased looked away from him, the accused was of the view
that the
deceased was looking at him out of the corner of his eye. That
apprehension arose because the accused at the time was suffering from
paranoid
schizophrenia.
<P>

4	Co-incidentally, with his apprehension that the deceased was looking at him,
the accused was suffering from an auditory hallucination
which manifested
itself in the form of voices, which appeared threatening to himself, his mother
and other members of his family.
His mental illness caused the accused to think
that the voices which he thought he was hearing, emanated from the deceased.
The combination
of his apprehension that the deceased was staring at him and
his auditory hallucinations, caused the accused to feel threatened.
<P>

5	That feeling had been present for some days prior to 6 September 1997.
Indeed, as will be revealed later in these reasons, in
the past, the accused
had suffered from auditory hallucinations, which had been recorded in medical
records following his admission
to hospitals. So threatened had he felt as a
consequence of the paranoiac element of his mental condition, that the day
before the
killing of the deceased, he had purchased a tomahawk from a hardware
store in Balmain, so he could protect himself against the threats
which he
perceived were being made to him.
<P>

6	After seeing the deceased, as a consequence of his apprehension as to the
observation the deceased was making of him and as a
result of his auditory
hallucinations, the accused believed that the only way in which he could deal
with the threat he perceived
from the deceased, was to follow him. This he
did.
<P>

7	He followed the deceased into William Street, and indeed overtook the
deceased at one stage, when the deceased ignored a greeting
directed by the
accused to him.
<P>

8	When the deceased stopped at one point in William Street, to look at cars in
a showroom window, the accused because of his deluded
state, was of the view
that the deceased had stopped in order to look at him out of the corner of his
eye, confirming the accused's
view, that he was being threatened by the
deceased.
<P>

9	After the deceased had crossed to the northern side of William Street, the
accused followed him. When the deceased reached the
corner of Dowling and
William Streets, the accused was directly behind him. At that point the accused
removed the tomahawk which
he had purchased the day before, from the lining of
his jacket.
<P>

10	He then struck the deceased on the back of his head with the blunt end of
the tomahawk blade. The deceased fell to the ground
as a consequence of the
blow. The accused then struck him six times with the sharp end of the tomahawk
blade and proceeded to kick
him. 
<P>

11	The blade of the tomahawk became embedded in the deceased's head and in
attempting to extract the weapon from the deceased the
accused dragged him
several metres. 
<P>

12	As he attempted to remove the tomahawk from the deceased's head, its rubber
handle became disengaged. The accused then threw
that rubber handle into
Dowling Street. After removing the tomahawk, the accused hid the weapon in his
coat and departed.
<P>

13	Pathological evidence tendered, revealed that the deceased must have died
within a few minutes of the attack as a consequence
of trauma to his brain and
blood loss.
<P>

14	Following the attack the accused walked to the Fitzroy Gardens in Macleay
Street and having remained there for a short time,
returned to William Street
and indeed walked past the crime scene where police and ambulance were then
present.
<P>

15	He then walked to Balmain where he was then living with his mother. When he
arrived at Balmain he went to the harbour side at
the end of a street known as
Lookes Avenue and threw the tomahawk into the water.
<P>

16	He then went home to his mother's home where he removed his clothes and
shoes which he put into a plastic bag and left for the
garbage collection by
council workers.
<P>

17	Over three months later, namely 19 December 1997, the accused went to the
Kings Cross police station and told police that he
had killed a person. He was
then interviewed by police using an ERISP machine. He made full admissions
during that interview. 
<P>

18	It is of importance to note that during the interview he told police that he
had discarded the rubber handle of the tomahawk
at the crime scene and revealed
where he had thrown the tomahawk into the harbour.
<P>

19	While some difficulty was encountered by police in recovering the tomahawk
from the harbour, a further interview on 29 December
with police at Silverwater
prison, following further information given to police at that time, the
tomahawk was found by police divers
near the point where the accused had
indicated he had thrown the weapon into the harbour.
<P>

20	The importance of the accused telling police that he had discarded the
tomahawk rubber handle and where he had thrown the weapon
itself is that these
were matters which could have only been known to the killer of the deceased.
<P>

21	The uncontested material which was tendered in evidence by the Crown in
support of the allegations, which I have just narrated,
provide convincing
proof beyond reasonable doubt of all the elements of the crime of murder. In
the absence of a valid defence, such
as mental illness, I would have found the
accused guilty of that crime.
<P>

22	However, there is ample evidence from both lay and medical sources which is
powerfully indicative that the accused was, at the
relevant time, mentally ill
according to law.
<P>

23	The lay evidence is to be found in statements taken from his mother, his
half brother and two acquaintances, a Mr Wai and a Mr
Sevilla.
<P>

24	His mother stated that he had exhibited violence and extraordinary behaviour
while living with her. The extraordinary behaviour
involved him throwing
cutlery and plates into a rubbish bin and taking, on some occasions, up to ten
showers a day over a considerable
period. He had exhibited violence to her, so
much so she had taken out an apprehended violence order against him. She had
observed
the tomahawk in her son's bedroom.
<P>

25	His brother also reported the accused's extraordinary behaviour in terms
both of violence and his destructive conduct over a
period of time. Of
importance is his brother's observation, that within a few months of the
killing of the deceased, he observed
his brother laughing for no reason,
shaving his legs and using crayons and play dough in a child-like fashion. He
also reported the
accused's curious conduct in putting kitchen utensils into
the garbage. Indeed, when his brother confronted the accused as to this
latter
conduct his explanation was, "I am just trying to do the right thing. I was
just cleaning up for Mum."
<P>

26	Both his mother and the brother reported an episode of violence at his
mother's home on 2 December 1997 that is seventeen days
before he surrendered
himself to police.
<P>

27	Mr Sevilla, who in the past had a sexual relationship with the accused,
stated that he had not seen the accused for some months,
until he made an
unexpected appearance at Sevilla's flat in November 1997, that is some two
months after the killing of the deceased.
<P>

28	Like the accused's brother he reported inexplicable laughter from the
accused together with narcissistic conduct, represented
by the accused looking
at himself in the mirror and flexing his muscles.
<P>

29	Mr Wai, a photographer, was also friendly with the accused. He had known the
accused since late 1995. At one stage the accused
lived in Mr Wai's flat for
some two months, during which time the accused's conduct on occasions, was so
odd as to make Mr Wai believe
the accused was mad.
<P>

30	At one time the accused told Mr Wai that homosexual people were looking at
him around the Darlinghurst area and that he hated
these people and not only
talked about getting a gun for the purpose of killing them but he asked Mr Wai
for money so that he could
buy one.
<P>

31	In September 1997, and I gather shortly after the killing of the deceased,
having met the accused at a nightclub, the pair eventually
went to Mr Wai's
premises. While there, the accused grabbed a large cooking knife from the
kitchen, grabbed Mr Wai by his shirt collar
and held the knife above him in a
threatening manner. Mr Wai said: "Why are you trying to kill me." The accused
replied: "What did
you say about my mum?" Eventually Mr Wai was able to mollify
the accused to the extent that the accused released him from his grip.
Mr Wai
then ran from the premises and called police. He told police that while he did
not want the accused charged he needed to help
stop the accused doing things
like that. Thus the lay evidence is indicative of the paranoid and
extraordinary conduct on behalf
of the accused, in the time around the killing
of the deceased.
<P>

32	The accused has a history of admissions to hospital when he has exhibited
psychotic symptoms. In evidence at this hearing, clinical
notes from the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital, the Caritas Unit at St Vincent's Hospital and the
Rozelle Hospital were tendered. 
<P>

33	In August 1995 he was admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he gave
a history of violence which he could not explain
and also a history of violent
sexual thoughts and visions. Relevantly, during that admission, he gave a
history of experiencing auditory
hallucinations.
<P>

34	A medical officer at that hospital was of the view that the accused was
exhibiting signs of psychotic illness. He was then referred
to the Rozelle
Hospital, where after a similar history was received, a tentative diagnosis of
schizophreniform psychosis was made.
<P>

35	In March and July 1996 he was seen at the Caritas Centre at St Vincent's
Hospital. Again a history of auditory hallucinations
was obtained together with
a history of anger. A diagnosis on both occasions of either schizophrenia or
schizophreniform disorder
was made.
<P>

36	Following his surrender on 19 December 1997 he has been seen by two forensic
psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Bruce Westmore,
both of whom have
furnished the court with reports and Dr Nielssen amplified his report with oral
evidence.
<P>

37	Both received accounts relating to the killing of the deceased which are
entirely consistent with the narrative given earlier
in these reasons. Both
doctors came to the same diagnosis, namely that the accused is suffering from
paranoid schizophrenia. Both
were of the view that the accused had a defence of
mental illness as a result of his disease of mind.
<P>

38	Dr Westmore was of the view that while the accused was aware of the nature
and quality of his actions and in the legal sense
that his actions were wrong,
he was of the view that the accused's illness totally deprived him of a
capacity to understand that
his behaviour was wrong in a moral sense and that
he was unable, due to his illness, to rationalise and reason about his
experiences
and his perceptions of his environment as an ordinary person would.
Dr Westmore was of the view that the accused required long term
psychiatric
care and supervision.
<P>

39	Dr Nielssen, like Dr Westmore, was of the view that the accused was aware of
the nature and quality of his acts but because of
his illness was powerless to
control his actions. Like Dr Westmore, Dr Nielssen was of the view that the
accused would require indefinite
supervision by forensic psychiatry
services.
<P>

40	In oral evidence Dr Nielssen referred to observations made by a psychiatric
registrar, to which reference has already been made,
of auditory
hallucinations.
<P>

41	Oral evidence was also given by Professor Robert Hayes, the President of the
Mental Health Review Tribunal going to the functions
of that Tribunal once a
person has been found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. That
evidence was given so that I could
direct myself, as I would direct a jury as
required by s 33(3) of the <b>Criminal Procedure Act</b> 1996 of the effects of
s 37 and s 38 of the <b>Mental health (Criminal Procedure) Act</b>. This I have
done and later in these reasons, the nature of that direction will become
apparent.
<P>

42	I should also add, that during his first record of interview, the accused
volunteered the fact that he had suffered from auditory
hallucinations
consistent with those referred to in my narrative of the events leading to the
killing of the deceased.
<P>

43	I turn then to the law relating to the defence of mental illness. The
classic statement of the defence of mental illness was
made 156 years ago in
England in <b>Regina v McNaughton</b> (1843) 8 ER 718 at 722 in these terms:
<P>

	"Was the accused at the time the offence was committed suffering from a defect
of reason, from a disease of the mind such as not
to know the quality and
nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what
he was doing was wrong."
<P>

44	That early statement of law has been the subject of amplification in
Australia in a number of well known cases.
<P>

45	Dixon J (as he then was) in directing a jury in the Australian Capital
Territory in <b>Regina v Porter</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2055%20CLR%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 55 CLR 182</a> at 189-190 stated the
test as follows:
<P>

	"Was the accused able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was
doing at the particular time? ... If through disordered
condition of the mind
he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and
composure it may be said that he could
not know what he was doing was
wrong."
<P>

46	That amplification was further taken by the High Court in <b>Regina v
Sodeman</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/75.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 75</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2055%20CLR%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 55 CLR 192</a> at 215 where the law was stated to be as
follows:
<P>

	"If the disease so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with
some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the
moral quality of what he is
doing he is prevented from knowing what he does is wrong."
<P>

47	The unchallenged medical and lay evidence in the matter squarely places this
case within the law as stated in the authorities
to which I have just referred,
particularly within the tests as adumbrated in <b>Sodeman</b>. Accordingly I am
driven to the conclusion that the accused has made out his defence of mental
illness. It follows that the verdict
of the court will be not guilty by reason
of mental illness.
<P>

48	It is important that I make clear for the information of Mr Gavranovic, his
family, the deceased's relatives and the community
at large, what are the
ramifications of this verdict.
<P>

49	This special verdict does not mean that the accused will be released as he
would following a verdict of not guilty, that is an
outright acquittal. The
accused, in fact, will be detained in strict custody by virtue of s 39 of the
<b>Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act</b>. This Court must further order
that the accused be detained in such a place and in such a manner as the court
thinks fit.
<P>

50	Accordingly, I order that he be detained, until directed otherwise by the
Mental Health Review Tribunal at the Long Bay prison
hospital.
<P>

51	Following the making of that order he comes under the supervision of the
Mental Health Review Tribunal which is headed by Professor
Hayes, to whose
evidence I have already referred. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal
will commence a review of the case
of the accused. The review could take more
than 14 days to complete but at the conclusion it would make a recommendation
to the Minister
for Health. That recommendation could be either unconditional,
or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should
be
detained, cared for or treated. If the Tribunal was satisfied, but only if it
was satisfied, that the safety of the accused or
any member of the public would
not be seriously endangered by his release, it could make a recommendation as
to his release. If it
makes such a recommendation then that would be considered
by the Department of Health which in turn would advise the Governor-in-council.
The Governor-in-Council would then, in accordance with the recommendation and
advice, either make an order for the detention of the
accused or for his
release conditional or unconditional. The Governor-in-Council could only make
an order for release where the Tribunal
itself had recommended release. After
that first hearing of the Mental Health Tribunal, assuming no recommendation
for release is
then made, it can at any later time and must at least once every
six months, review the case of the accused.
<P>

52	After hearing the evidence at a later review, it must make a recommendation
to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention,
care or treatment of
the accused or as to his release conditional or unconditional. I stress that
the Tribunal is not free at any
such review to make a recommendation for
release unless it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of
the public
would not be seriously endangered by release. Again following such a
review and recommendation the matter goes to the Department
of Health and the
Minister advises the Governor-in-Council. Any recommendation so advised can be
carried into effect only by order
of the Governor-in-Council.
<P>

53	If the accused was at any time released back into the public on conditions
and it happened that a breach of those conditions
took place, then the
Governor-in-Council may order that the accused be apprehended and detained.
Such an order would follow by reason
of the practical consideration that if a
person is released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his
case with the
assistance of a Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist,
or one of the other public facilities available. In other words,
if a person is
released conditionally back into the community, then the Department maintains a
watch over him and a breach of any
conditions would lead to him being
apprehended and detained once again.
<P>

54	The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a
particular place, taking particular medication and
so on, to ensure that the
patient or the accused was properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such
release, the accused would
remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody
within one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients.
<P>

55	The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the
purposes of these provisions is when he is unconditionally
released by the
Governor-in-Council, or is released upon conditions which include a condition
as to the time that his release should
become unconditional. If that time
expires, then his release becomes unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic
patient. However,
as I previously explained, the accused or a forensic patient
in his position, can never be released unless the Mental Health Tribunal,
comprising persons with special qualifications, was satisfied, on the evidence
available to it, that his safety and the safety of
any member of the public
would not be seriously endangered.
<P>

56	The verdict and orders of the court will those I have already stated.
