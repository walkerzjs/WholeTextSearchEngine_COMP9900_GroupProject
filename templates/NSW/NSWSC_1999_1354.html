<u>REGINA v Warren James TIGHE</u><b></b><p>
<b></b><u></u><p>
<u></u>Friday 7 February 1997<p>
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES  DIVISION<br>HUNT CJ at CL<p>
<p>
<b>SENTENCE</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	<p>
	The prisoner (Warren James Tighe) was found by the jury to be not guilty of
the murder of his defacto wife (Helen Reberta Boney)
but guilty of her
manslaughter, after a trial lasting thirteen days.<p>
<p>
	The principal issue at the trial was whether it was the act of the prisoner
which caused the death of the deceased.  The evidence
against him was entirely
circumstantial, and was dependent upon a number of medical issues.  The
deceased died as a result of a subarachnoid
haemorrhage.  The Crown had to
eliminate any reasonable possibility that it had occurred spontaneously and
that, if traumatic, the
subarachnoid haemorrhage had occurred as a result of an
accidental fall.  It did so by evidence that the injuries which the deceased
sustained around her head and face were either inconsistent with having been
caused by an accidental fall or that it was not reasonably
possible that they
were caused in that way.<p>
<p>
	I was not surprised that the evidence of the two consultant pathologists
called by the prisoner upon these issues failed to impress
the jury.  The time
must be fast approaching when steps will have to be taken by the relevant
professional body to impress upon the
growing number of doctors who hold
themselves out as "forensic" pathologists that there is, and still remains, a
significant difference
between what is a possibility and what is a
<i>reasonable</i> possibility, even in the field of pathology.  Some of the
evidence given in this trial, in my view, bordered on the irresponsible.<p>
<p>
	The jury's verdict established that it was the act of the prisoner which
caused the death of the deceased.  I am satisfied that
that act was a blow to
the area of the right side of her lower jaw which caused her head to rotate
suddenly, leading to the tearing
of the blood vessels connected to the brain,
or of minor blood vessels branching from those vessels.  A loss of
consciousness followed
immediately, and the deceased dropped to the floor.  It
is reasonable to conclude that at least some of the other injuries to her
face
and head were caused when she did so, but it cannot explain them all.  I am
satisfied that the prisoner must have struck her
more than once, but I am
unable to say which injuries were the result of that additional blow or those
additional blows.<p>
<p>
	The prisoner has expressed an inability to understand how he could be guilty
of manslaughter when the jury had found him not guilty
of murder.  I shall
attempt to explain.  The Crown conceded that there was no evidence of an
intention to kill, and that its case
upon an intention to inflict grievous
bodily harm was a thin one.  The only evidence of such an intention was the
nature of the blow
itself which caused the subarachnoid haemorrhage.  There was
also evidence from all of the doctors that, where a victim who suffers
such a
haemorrhage is affected by alcohol, less force than otherwise is needed to
cause the sudden rotation of the head which in
turn results in the haemorrhage.
The deceased had the equivalent of eighteen ten ounce glasses of beer
circulating in her system
at the time of her death.  One of the Crown's doctors
said that a minor amount of force was sufficient to cause that rotation in
those circumstances.  Even a sober person applying such force to her head could
hardly have realized that, by striking her with such
a minor degree of force,
she would have suffered grievous bodily harm.  The prisoner was obviously
intoxicated himself at the time,
and there was no dispute by the Crown that he
must have been well affected by alcohol at the time when he struck the
deceased.<p>
<p>
	As is usual in manslaughter cases, the jury were directed that the Crown did
not have to establish that the prisoner intended to
inflict a really serious
injury or indeed that he intended to inflict any type of injury.  They were
directed that the crime of manslaughter
is complete even if no injury was
intended, and even if the prisoner himself had not realised that what he was
doing was dangerous
in the sense which I had earlier described - that is, that
it was such that an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner would
have
realised that, by that act, the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable or
a significant risk of serious injury.  It was
made clear to the jury that the
test was an objective one;  it was not whether the prisoner recognised that his
act was dangerous.<p>
<p>
	I am not satisfied that the prisoner intended to inflict any particular injury
upon the deceased.  At most, in my view, the blow
or blows which led to her
death would have been something done in a sudden fit of temper, with the
intention perhaps of hurting the
deceased but no more.  There was certainly no
appreciation by the prisoner of the terrible consequences which did in fact
flow from
that blow or blows.  That in no way detracts from the jury's verdict,
as it was nevertheless clearly open to them to be satisfied
in relation to the
objective test which they had to consider.  The reasonable person would not
have been disabled to the extent that
the prisoner was disabled by
intoxication.<p>
<p>
	I therefore must sentence the prisoner upon the basis that he was responsible
for the unlawful and dangerous act which caused the
death of the deceased.  I
should say at once that I do not propose to take the prisoner's intoxication
into account in mitigation.
 I am not satisfied that his intoxication was out
of character: cf <b>The Queen v Sewell &amp; Walsh</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2029%20SASR%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 29 SASR 12</a> at
14-15;  <b>Regina v Coleman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 57 A Crim R 306</a> at 327.  At the same
time, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that I should take his
intoxication into account in aggravation
either.<p>
<p>
	The prisoner has a long criminal record, stretching back to 1980 (when he was
fifteen years of age), for offences of breaking, entering
and stealing and
similar offences, for nuisance offences such as hindering police and offensive
behaviour, some minor drug offences,
and some failure to appear offences.
There are no convictions for violence, and I am satisfied that this violence
(such as it was)
was out of character for the prisoner, both generally and
towards the deceased.  I am also satisfied that he will not present any
danger
of similar violence in the future.  It is clear from the material before me
that the prisoner has long had a problem with
alcohol, and that he has also
abused drugs. I am told that he was undergoing a rehabilitation course for some
months before this
incident.  It is obvious from the evidence of what went on
during the day leading up to the death of the deceased that that counselling
had not been very successful.<p>
<p>
	It has nevertheless been urged upon me that the prisoner is anxious to
rehabilitate himself.  I accept that that intention on his
part is a genuine
one, but I am also certain that it is going to be a very hard road over which
he will have to travel in order to
achieve that rehabilitation.  No doubt, at
thirtyone years of age, he is now approaching that period of life when most
offenders
given away the life of petty crime which the prisoner has led for so
long.  The difficulty will lie in the rehabilitation which he
needs from his
alcohol and substance abuse.<p>
<p>
	A report from Mr Taylor, the clinical psychologist, expresses the view that
the prisoner suffers from an anxiety disorder and a
Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder, which has led to a high pre-disposition towards substance abuse.  The
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,
Mr Taylor says, relates to a shooting incident
in 1982, when the prisoner's cousin was shot and fatally wounded.  The gunman's
second
shot had hit the prisoner in the small of the back near the spine and
passed cleanly through his body.  Whether or not the relationship
between the
events suggested by Mr Taylor should be accepted, and I have some doubt about
it, I do accept that the prisoner has an
unstable personality functioning, and
limited resources to assist him in coping with his life.<p>
<p>
	That is consistent both with the facts as I accept them to be in relation to
this offence and to the prisoner's need for considerable
assistance when he is
ultimately released on parole.  The Crown has very properly conceded that it is
open to me to vary the statutory
ratio between the minimum and additional terms
so as to set a longer than usual additional term for that purpose.  I propose
to do
so.  The other finding by Mr Taylor, that the prisoner is mildly
intellectually handicapped, may be consistent with the tests which
he carried
out, but the unreality of that so far as the prisoner is concerned - that is,
in real life - was demonstrated by the prisoner's
ability to cope very well
indeed with giving evidence and being cross-examined in the trial.  I was
struck at the time by his ability
to deal with the questions and with the quiet
dignity which he displayed.<p>
<p>
	The prisoner has maintained his innocence, and therefore he does not have the
benefit of having shown contrition.  That is not to
say that he is to be
punished more for his continued protestations of innocence;  he simply does not
receive mitigation for a confession.
 At the same time, I am satisfied that the
prisoner has been deeply distressed by the horrific consequences which flowed
from his
act.  I am impressed by the thoughtfulness of the document which he
presented today, in which he discusses the problems which he
will have in
facing the five children born from his relationship with the deceased when they
are old enough to expect an explanation
from him for the death of their mother.
Indeed - acknowledging the high skill of his counsel throughout the trial and
in relation
to these sentencing proceedings - I have found that document to be
of the greatest assistance of all in my assessment of the prisoner
as a man.
It has impressed me very much indeed.<p>
<p>
	I accept that the children will suffer greatly from this sad tragedy, but
their hardship is unfortunately not a matter which I can
have much regard to in
the circumstances of this case: <b>Regina v Alexander</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2078%20A%20Crim%20R%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 78 A Crim R
141</a> at 145;  <b>Regina v Cynthia Therese Edwards</b> (CCA, 17 December 1996,
unreported) at 13-15.  The law does not permit me to do so.<p>
<p>
	Because of the prisoner's Aboriginality, I must and do take into account the
propositions stated by Wood J in <b>Regina v Fernando</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20A%20Crim%20R%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) A Crim R 58</a> at
62-63.  It is unnecessary for me to repeat them.  The offence was nevertheless
a serious one by reason of the loss of life which
resulted from the prisoner's
act.  It requires a substantial period of imprisonment.  There was no period of
pre-trial custody. 
The prisoner entered custody following the jury's verdict
on 21 November last and the sentence will be backdated to that time.<p>
<p>
	<b>Warren James Tighe</b>, for the manslaughter of Helen Reberta Boney, I
impose a sentence of penal servitude for four and a half years, consisting of a
minimum
term of two and a half years and an additional term of two years.  The
minimum term commenced on 21 November 1996 and it will conclude
on 20 May 1999.
You will be eligible for parole on 21 May 1999.  I recommend that you be
classified for a gaol to which your family
(who presently live in Ballina) will
have access as conveniently as possible.<p>
