<b><u>070092/96  -  REGINA  v  Anthony Stuart MOFFATT [No 4]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This matter proceeded before me as a Judge sitting alone.
On 26 March 1999 I gave judgment and found that the prisoner had murdered
Richard James Fyfe.  That judgment sets out the objective facts from which the
criminality of Mr Moffatt's actions must be judged.
<P>

2	Mr Moffatt, then a man aged 36 years, shared a flat at Cronulla with Mr
Ronald Godfrey.  Mr Godfrey was considerably older.  Both
were alcoholics.
<P>

3	On Anzac Day, 25 April 1996, the prisoner and Mr Godfrey began drinking
early.  Mr Moffatt was in the habit of drinking a mixture
of methylated spirits
and wine, and did so on this day.
<P>

4	Others drifted into the flat, and the drinking continued.  Mr William
Williams arrived with yet more alcohol.  He too was an alcoholic.
 In the early
evening the deceased, Richard James Fyfe, arrived.  He was someone who had been
to the flat before.  Mr Moffatt had
met him once.  Mr Fyfe was also an
alcoholic.  He was a man aged 43 years.  He was already considerably affected
by alcohol when
he arrived.
<P>

5	In the course of the evening an argument developed between the prisoner and
Mr Fyfe.  Mr Fyfe pestered Mr Moffatt for a knife.
 The prisoner used to own
the knife, and had shown it to Mr Fyfe at their first meeting.  However, he had
since disposed of it. 
He conveyed that fact to Mr Fyfe.  Mr Fyfe, presumably
because he was drunk, would not accept that Mr Moffatt no longer had the knife.
He continued to ask to be shown it.  The prisoner reacted angrily.  Using a
hammer, he destroyed a mirror and certain glass ornaments
in the flat.
<P>

6	Mr Fyfe then insulted Mr Moffatt.  He called him a "dog".  The prisoner
immediately attacked Mr Fyfe, placing his hands around
his throat.  The two men
were separated by Messrs Godfrey and Williams.  They resumed drinking.
Approximately fifteen minutes later
Mr Fyfe again insulted the prisoner.  He
called him a "mutt", which, of course, is another word for "dog".
<P>

7	Mr Moffatt, in his own words, "snapped".  Using the flat part of the hammer,
he repeatedly struck Mr Fyfe on the chest, breaking
several of his ribs.  He
then threw the hammer away.  He began strangling Mr Fyfe.  He continued to do
so for some minutes until
he heard a crack.  The post mortem examination of the
deceased revealed a fracture to the thyroid cartilage. 
<P>

8	At the same time as the prisoner heard the crack in the neck, Mr Fyfe's eyes
rolled back, and he appeared lifeless.  The prisoner
checked for a pulse in his
neck.  There was none.  He held a mirror in front of his mouth.  There was no
breath.
<P>

9	I determined that the prisoner had intended to inflict grievous bodily harm
upon Mr Fyfe when he attacked him shortly before he
died. I was left in some
doubt, however, as to whether the prisoner intended to kill Mr Fyfe.  There
were aspects of his conduct
which suggested that, notwithstanding admissions
made to police, he had not set out to kill the deceased.  Rather, he simply
wished
to silence Mr Fyfe, he having been repeatedly insulted by him.
<P>

10	The actions of Mr Moffatt were without premeditation.  They were, in fact,
although not in law, provoked by the deceased.  His
actions were substantially
the consequence of alcohol consumption, he being an alcoholic.  His blood
alcohol level at the time of
the offence was estimated to be between 0.277 and
0.375 grams/100 mls.  Mr Moffatt had a number of convictions for offences which
were alcohol related.  However, there was nothing in his past which suggested a
propensity for violence on anything like the level
that occurred on this
evening.
<P>

11	The deceased, it must be said, suffered from a number of conditions which
made it highly likely that he would meet an early death.
 He suffered from
serious heart disease, and alcoholism.  His blood alcohol level at the time of
death was 0.48 grams/100 mls.  The
offence is the acceleration of his death.
Mr Fyfe was very much an "egg-shell skull".
<P>

12	Murder is, of course, the most serious offence in the criminal calender.  It
is, therefore, deserving of significant punishment.
 Nonetheless, in terms of
objective criminality, the offence by the prisoner, in my view, is
significantly less grave than many that
come before these Courts, as the Crown
acknowledged.  That fact must be reflected in the sentence imposed.
<P>

13	Turning to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner.  Mr Moffatt did not
give evidence either during the trial, or on sentence.
 He has, however, seen a
number of doctors, and described to them his background.  He was born in
Belfast on 18 January 1960.  He
is now aged thirty-nine years.  He has not had
an easy life.  He was sexually abused by a relative as a very young child
before he
left Ireland.  His aberrant behaviour may, in part, be a consequence
of that abuse.
<P>

14	Mr Moffatt came to Australia at the age of nine years.  His family initially
settled in Perth.  However, during the next four
years, the family slowly
worked its way across the continent, ultimately settling in Sydney.  As a
result, Mr Moffatt's schooling
was disrupted.  He had difficulty at school, and
was frequently absent.  He eventually left school at the age of fourteen
years.
<P>

15	Mr Moffatt then worked as a labourer in various capacities.  He joined the
army at the age of nineteen years, but was discharged
eighteen months later for
being drunk, and absent without leave.
<P>

16	At the age of twenty-two years he was involved in a car accident.  He
suffered a back injury.  Alcohol was already a problem,
and became an even
greater problem.  He began living on the streets.  He was admitted to a number
of institutions for detoxification
and rehabilitation.  He only briefly resumed
work at the age of twenty-nine years.  He secured a job in a tyre factory, but
lasted
only two months.  Again drinking was the problem.  He was ultimately
given a disability pension.  He was thirty-six years old at
the time of the
offence.
<P>

17	Looking at Mr Moffatt's criminal record, a custodial sentence has never been
imposed.  He was placed on a recognisance in respect
of certain alcohol related
offences in December 1983.  He entered a further recognisance in 1988 for
assault occasioning actual bodily
harm.  He was also fined for malicious
injury.
<P>

18	In the same year, 1987, he was charged with aggravated assault, resist
arrest and malicious injury.  The matters were heard ex
parte in April 1988.
Fines were imposed in respect of each offence.  It rather appears that Mr
Moffatt was then arrested, and spent
time in gaol because he was unable to pay
those fines.  When interviewed by the police shortly after the murder, Mr
Moffatt referred
to having spent forty-two days at Long Bay (A. 108).  There
are various other minor offences on his record.  He was ordered to undertake
sixty hours of community service on 23 March 1989, having been found guilty of
malicious injury.
<P>

19	Mr Moffatt, of course, pleaded not guilty to the various offences on the
indictment before me.  However, I accept that he did
so on legal advice, there
being an issue as to the cause of Richard Fyfe's death.  Although ultimately I
resolved that issue against
the prisoner, it was entirely appropriate that the
issue should have been explored.  There was significant evidence of other
possible
causes which caused Dr Lawrence, the doctor who performed the post
mortem examination, to give careful consideration to the cause
of death at the
time the death certificate was issued.  Given Mr Moffatt's inebriation at the
time the offence took place, there
was also an issue of intention, and the
possibility of confabulation.  These matters, as I say, were ultimately
resolved against
the prisoner.
<P>

20	It is said on the prisoner's behalf that he has shown contrition.  He told
Dr Wong that he was deeply remorseful for what had
occurred.  I accept that the
prisoner has experienced genuine remorse.  His actions immediately after the
incident were a demonstration
of that remorse.  It is apparent from the
statements he made soon after the murder to his neighbours, and later the
police, that
he was horrified by what had occurred.
<P>

21	Turning to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a>, I believe that there are, in
the prisoner's case, special circumstances.  It is clear from his record, and
from the circumstances
of the murder, that he has a substantial problem with
alcohol.  It is highly desirable that he be subjected to a longer period of
supervision that might ordinarily be the case, in order to ensure that he does
not again take up the life of an alcoholic.
<P>

22	<b>Anthony Stuart Moffatt</b>, I sentence you to penal servitude for a
period of 11 years made up of a minimum term of 6 years commencing on the date
on which
you went into custody, 26 April 1996, and expiring on 25 April 2002;
and to an additional term of 5 years, commencing on 26 April
2002 and expiring
on 25 April 2007.  The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for
release to parole will be 25 April 2002.
<P>

23	I recommend that, when the prisoner is admitted to parole, he be provided
with rehabilitation or treatment which addresses his
difficulties with
alcohol.
