<b>50097/1998 - ADI LIMITED   v   NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, ADI Limited, ("ADI"), for which Mr M.W.
Hadley of Counsel appeared, commenced these proceedings against National
Australia Bank Limited, ("the Bank"), for which Mr S.M.P. Reeves of Counsel
appeared, by a Summons filed on 6 August 1998.
<P>

2   	The pleadings were amended from time to time and, at the
commencement of the hearing on 1 November 1999, I was provided with
a Further
Amended Summons, a Defence thereto and a Third Further Amended Cross-Claim.
These documents reflected a degree of agreement
to which the parties had come
in relation to a number of matters, and the matters in issue.
<P>

3   	On 8 February 1994 the Bank took a fixed and floating
equitable charge over the property of a group of companies, to which
I shall
refer as "Stanilite".  On 22 May 1996, the "Effective Date", Messrs John
William Murphy and Martin Madden were appointed
as Receivers and Managers of
Stanilite pursuant to the charge and, on 12 July 1996, the Bank, as vendor,
entered into an Agreement
for Sale of Business with ADI, as purchaser, for the
sale of the assets and business of Stanilite on the terms set forth therein.
"Completion" was defined as settlement of the sale and purchase of the Assets
in accordance with clause 5, and "Completion Date"
was defined as 19 July 1996
or any other date agreed by the Bank and ADI.  In the result it was 19 July
1996.
<P>

4   	The introduction to the Agreement stated:-
<P>

<b>"A.	Stanilite, primarily through SEPL, carries on the business of design,
manufacture and service support of:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	aerospace and defence equipment and systems;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	wireless telecommunications equipment and systems; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	emergency and evacuation lighting.</b>
<P>

<b>  B.	The Bank, being entitled under powers conferred upon it by the Charge
has agreed to sell and the Purchaser has agreed to purchase
the assets and the
business of Stanilite on the following terms.</b>
<P>

<b>  C.	The Purchaser has based its valuation of the Business on its own
investigation and analysis of Stanilite's cost and cash flow
position as at 22
May 1996.  The Purchase Price will be adjusted upwards or downwards by changes
in the net cash flow position of
the Material Contracts which are agreed
between the parties for the period between the Effective Date and
Completion."</b>
<P>

5   	ADI claims an entitlement to an adjustment, pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement, in the sum of $823,115 on the basis that
the Bank
and/or Stanilite have received five payments after the Effective Date and prior
to and including the Completion Date in
respect of goods to be supplied or
services to be rendered after the Completion Date.  It was common ground that
the adjustments
were sought for payments made in respect of Excluded Contracts,
and Mr Hadley conceded that there was no assignment or novation of
any Excluded
Contracts to ADI, such that it came under any contractual obligations for
Excluded Contracts.
<P>

6   	In its Third Further Amended Cross-Claim the Bank sought
judgment in the sum of $628,248 for various amounts, the only issue
in relation
to its entitlement to that amount being whether it is entitled to $60,000
incurred prior to the Effective Date but paid
after it, in circumstances to
which I shall refer.  In its Further Amended Summons ADI claimed $254,867 being
the difference between
the gross amount it sought of $2,711,971 and allowances
to the Bank of $2,457,104.  
<P>

7   	Essentially, the various amounts being agreed, each of the
claims depends upon a proper construction of the Agreement. 
<P>

8   	During the hearing I rejected certain evidence, which ADI
sought to tender.  That evidence was Marked for Identification 1,
2 and 3.  I
have given sufficient reasons for rejecting the tender.  After that occurred
the parties requested me to decide the construction
issues on the basis that
adverse findings to ADI on the issue it propounded would mean that it was not
necessary to seek to call,
at some future time, the rejected evidence.  The
evidence was not necessary for the issue put forward by the Bank.  I agreed to
this
course, as it seemed to me a sensible approach to bring about as speedy a
possible resolution to the litigation.
<P>

<b>The Terms Of The Agreement</b>
<P>

9   	ADI's claim, essentially, was that between the Effective
Date and the Date of Completion payments were made by parties to the
Bank
and/or Stanilite, in respect of goods to be supplied or services to be rendered
pursuant to Excluded Contracts after the Completion
Date, to which payments ADI
was entitled pursuant to various terms of the Agreement, including clause
1.2(1) of Schedule 12.  ADI's
three main submissions in support of this
entitlement were that:-
<P>

(a)	The Excluded Contracts were Assets, as defined, which it acquired under the
Agreement.
<P>

(b)	If the first submission was not correct, none-the-less payments received in
respect of the Excluded Contracts were payments
"in respect of goods to be
supplied or services to be rendered after the Completion Date" and, in
accordance with clause 1.2(1) of
Schedule 12 were amounts in respect of which
an adjustment had to be made in favour of ADI.
<P>

(c)	That if neither of these submissions was accepted ADI none-the-less
acquired the Goodwill and the failure to meet the obligations
under those
Contracts, notwithstanding that they were not acquired by ADI, would
detrimentally affect the Goodwill.
<P>

10   	The Bank's principal submissions were that:-
<P>

(a)	The Assets did not include the Excluded Contracts.
<P>

(b)	Accordingly, any adjustment in the purchase price was not appropriate in
relation to moneys paid in respect of Excluded Contracts.
<P>

(c)	The purpose of clause 1.2(1) of Schedule 12 was to provide a method of
adjustment of the purchase price conformably with clause
3(1) of the Agreement,
and was subject to that clause, such that it did not stand alone as the
provision for making an adjustment.
<P>

(d)	The adjustment provision was to ensure that any payments received by the
Bank or Stanilite prior to and including the Completion
Date, in respect of
goods to be supplied or services to be rendered after that date, was a payment
in respect of contractual obligations
ADI would have to meet pursuant to its
acquisition of all contracts other than Excluded Contracts and Material
Contracts and, therefore,
was a necessary adjustment in respect of such other
contracts pursuant to which ADI would have to supply the goods and render the
services.  A separate provision was made in respect of Material Contracts.
<P>

(e)	There was no assignment or novation of Excluded Contracts to ADI, such as
to place it under any obligation or liability to perform
such contracts.
<P>

(f)	The matters just stated indicated that there could be no adverse
affectation on ADI's Goodwill, because there was no requirement
on it to
perform the Excluded Contracts.
<P>

11   	The Agreement defined "Assets" as meaning all Stanilite's
right, title and interest in, inter alia, "Contracts (including
Material
Contracts)".  It also defined Assets as including:-
<P>

<b>"(i)	all other property and assets of Stanilite (excluding land and
buildings) connected with the Business and required by the Purchaser."</b>
<P>

12   	"Contracts" were defined as:-
<P>

<b>"... the contracts and commitments entered into by Stanilite which are not
fully performed as at the completion date as listed in
part 1 of schedule 6 or
agreed between the Bank and the Purchaser in writing, <u>which are to be
assumed by the Purchaser under this agreement but does not include the Excluded
Contracts</u>."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

13   	"Excluded Contracts" were defined as:-
<P>

<b>"... the contracts and commitments of Stanilite in the ordinary course of
conducting a Business (including associated debtors and
creditors) which are
not fully performed as at the Completion Date listed in part 2 of schedule 6
and any other substantially unprofitable
contracts related to the Business and
includes contracts which are completed except for performance of warranty
and/or support obligations
by Stanilite and contracts which are outside the
ordinary course of conducting the Business."</b>
<P>

14   	"Business" was defined as the business presently carried
on by Stanilite, being the design, manufacture and service support
of:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	aerospace and defence equipment and systems;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	wireless telecommunications equipment and systems; and</b>
<P>

<b>  (c)	emergency and evacuation lighting."</b>
<P>

15   	"Secured Property" was defined, in relation to Stanilite,
as:-
<P>

<b>".. all the present and future rights, property and undertaking of Stanilite
of whatever kind and wherever situated including, without
limitation, the
capital and share premiums of Stanilite, called or uncalled, paid or
unpaid."</b>
<P>

16   	Clause 2.1(1) provided:-
<P>

<b>"The Bank being entitled under the powers conferred upon the Charge agrees
to:</b>
<P>

<b>1.	Sell and the Purchaser agrees to purchase the interest that Stanilite has
in the Assets the subject of the Charge for the Purchase
Price and on the terms
and conditions of this agreement with effect from the close of business on the
Completion Date;"</b>
<P>

17   	Clause 3.1 provided:-
<P>

<b>"The Purchase Price for the Assets is $29,400,000 as adjusted in accordance
with the provisions of:</b>
<P>

<b>1.	schedule 12 (Adjustments):</b>
<P>

<b>2.	clause 7 (apportionment) and</b>
<P>

<b>3.	clause 11.5 (accrued entitlements of Transferring Employees)."</b>
<P>

18   	Clause 5.1 provided for completion of the sale and
purchase of the Assets to take place on the Completion Date and for the
delivery by the Bank to ADI or its solicitors of various documents including,
Clause 5.2(d):-
<P>

<b>"assignments or novations of such of the Contracts relating to the Business
as it has then obtained duly executed by all the parties
to the Contracts
together with the originals or counterparts of the Contracts held by Stanilite
as can be located by the Bank."</b>
<P>

19   	Clause 5.3(1) required that at Completion the Bank must
use all reasonable endeavours to transfer to ADI the benefit of any
Contracts,
(other than the Material Contracts and the Property Leases), entered into by
Stanilite in the ordinary course of carrying
on the business; and clause 5.5
provided:-
<P>

<b>"From the date of this agreement until 60 days after the Completion Date the
parties will use all reasonable endeavours to obtain
the consent of all parties
to the Material Contracts to assignment to the Purchaser or novation of each
Material Contract on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser with effect
from the date of such novation or assignment."</b>
<P>

20   	Clause 8.2 provided that risk in the Contracts, including
Material Contracts, passed to ADI on assignment to it or novation
of the
Contract in question.
<P>

21   	Clause 13.1 provided that the Bank and ADI agreed to use
all reasonable endeavours to ensure that ADI obtained the benefit
of the
Contracts from the close of business on the Completion Date; and to obtain the
consent of the other parties to any Contracts
reasonably specified by ADI to
the assignment of those Contracts or to their novation on terms reasonably
acceptable to ADI.  Clause
13.2 provided that ADI accepted responsibility for
the performance of the Contracts assigned or novated to it, and indemnified the
Bank against any liability or loss arising under any of the Contracts assigned
to it as a result of any act or omission of ADI after
assignment or
novation.
<P>

22   	Schedule 6 is headed "Particulars of Contracts".  Part 1
identified "Contracts".  Part 2 referred to "Excluded Contracts"
as "contracts
not identified in parts 1 and 3 of this schedule", and part 3 specified the
"Material Contracts".
<P>

23   	Schedule 12 is headed "Adjustments".  Paragraph 1 is
headed "The Business (other than Material Contracts)", and provided:-
<P>

<b>"1.1	The Purchaser must reimburse the Bank for any payments (except with
respect to the Material Contracts) made by the Bank or Stanilite,
in the
ordinary course of the Business, prior to and including the Completion
Date:</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	in respect of wages paid, goods to be supplied and services to be
rendered to the Business after the Completion Date for the benefit
of the
Purchaser (other than any payments under contracts for breach of warranty or
other claims or which are covered by insurance);
and</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	which result in a benefit being received by the Business after the
Completion Date.</b>
<P>

<b>1.2	The Bank must reimburse the Purchaser for (except with respect to the
Material Contracts):</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	any payments received by the Bank or Stanilite prior to and including
the Completion Date in respect of goods to be supplied or
services to be
rendered after the Completion Date;</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	any goods supplied or services rendered (including service by employees)
to Stanilite in respect of the Business prior to and
including the Completion
Date, payment for which must be made by the Purchaser after the Completion
Date; and</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	any payment which the Purchaser will become liable to make in respect of
the Business after the Completion Date, where the benefit
was received by the
Business before the Completion Date."</b>
<P>

The effect of these two clauses is to ensure an adjustment of amounts paid,
other than in respect of Material Contracts, where either
ADI or the Bank would
obtain a benefit, which benefit would pass to the other.
<P>

24   	Clause 2 was concerned with Material Contracts, and
provided:-
<P>

<b>"2.1	Where, in the ordinary course of performing the Material
Contracts:</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	any payments have been made by the Bank or Stanilite after the Effective
Date in respect of wages paid, goods supplied or services
rendered under the
Material Contracts after the Effective Date (other than any payments under
Contracts for breach of warranty or
other claims or which are covered by
insurance), then the Purchaser must reimburse the Bank for those
payments;</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	any payments have been received by the Bank or Stanilite after the
Effective Date in respect of goods supplied or services rendered
under the
Material Contracts, then the Bank must reimburse the Purchaser for those
payments."</b>
<P>

25   	Clause 3 is headed "Details of Payment" and provided:-
<P>

<b>"3.1	The Bank must provide the Purchaser with details of all the payments
referred to in the above clauses in writing not later than
14 days after the
Completion Date together with such verification as the Purchaser may reasonably
require."</b>
<P>

<b>A Consideration of ADI's Submissions</b>
<P>

26   	It was not in issue, as I have said, that the payments for
which ADI sought reimbursement, pursuant to Schedule 12 clause
1.2(1), were
made in respect of "Excluded Contracts".  As I have indicated, the first
submission of ADI was that an Excluded Contract
constituted an Asset, which was
sold by the Bank to ADI.  As a matter of construction I consider that this
submission must be rejected.
 It was conceded by Mr Hadley that in so far as
the list of Assets included "Contracts including Material Contracts", that
"Contracts",
wherever used in the Agreement, had the meaning attributed to that
word in the definition clause and, accordingly, did not include
the Excluded
Contracts.  However, he submitted, that the Excluded Contracts were included in
"all other property and assets of Stanilite
.. connected with the Business and
required by the Purchaser".  In my view this cannot be correct.  The reference
to Contracts clearly
deals with those Assets falling within the definition of
"Contracts" and, in these circumstances, it is equally clear that the Excluded
Contracts are not included in the Assets being acquired, a point reinforced by
the fact that there was no assignment or novation
of them to ADI.  I do not
consider that one can seek to draw back into the contracts being acquired the
Excluded Contracts by reference
to sub-clause (i) of the definition of Assets,
which, in my opinion, is a catch-all provision for Assets not otherwise dealt
with.
 In my opinion, the Excluded Contracts have been dealt with by exclusion
from the Assets.  Mr Hadley also submitted that the Excluded
Contracts were
part of the Business.  I do not agree.  Business defined the activities in
which Stanilite operated.  That which was
sold was the Assets, not the
Business.  That is made clear by clauses 2.1 and 3.1.
<P>

27   	Nextly clause 3.1 provides that the Purchase Price is for
the Assets.  In my opinion, it cannot be asserted that the Purchase
Price is to
cover something other than the Assets.  Nor can it be asserted that the
adjustment to be made as provided by Schedule
12 is other than in relation to
the Purchase Price for those Assets and not, as Mr Hadley suggested, for some
other assets, which
were not being acquired.  To achieve that result would
require very clear words.  I should mention that Mr Hadley referred back to
clause 2.1(1) and submitted that as the charging provision of the Charge was
sufficiently wide to cover the Excluded Contracts the
reference to "the Assets
the subject of the Charge" was a reference to, inter alia, the Excluded
Contracts.  I do not agree with
this submission.  It seems to me that one
firstly has to find what the Assets are and then, in so far as they are subject
to the
Charge, they are the subject of the sale and purchase.
<P>

28   	Mr Hadley submitted that no assistance was derived from
Schedule 6.  In the circumstances of this case that may well be so
because
there was agreement that the amount sought to be recovered was in respect of
the Excluded Contracts and, therefore, it was
not necessary to further consider
that matter.
<P>

29   	He submitted nextly that the adjustment to be made
pursuant to clause 1.2(1) of Schedule 12 was not confined to the Assets,
but to
any payments made prior to the Completion Date in respect of goods to be
supplied or services to be rendered after the Completion
Date.  He agreed that
goods were only to be supplied and services were only to be rendered pursuant
to contracts, but he continued
that notwithstanding that it mattered not that
the payments were in respect of goods to be supplied or services to be rendered
under
the Excluded Contracts, notwithstanding that ADI was undertaking no
obligations under those contracts.  He submitted, and in terms
this submission
is probably correct, that the Agreement could provide for the Purchase Price to
be adjusted in any way the parties
agreed, so that even if the Excluded
Contracts were not Assets, none-the-less the parties could agree to adjust it
by reference to
payments made in respect of goods to be supplied or services to
be rendered under them.  That may be correct, as an hypothesis, but
it would,
in my opinion, require the use of very clear words and it does not arise from
the words used in the Agreement.  The further
difficulty however with that
submission, in my view, is that the adjustment being made pursuant to clause
3.1 is an adjustment in
respect of the Purchase Price of the Assets and, as a
matter of construction, it would be a very strange result if it was to be
inferred
from clause 3.1 and Schedule 12 that the Purchase Price for the Assets
was to be adjusted by reference to assets which were not the
subject of the
sale and in respect of which ADI was undertaking no liability.  Theoretically
the Contract could make such a provision,
but, in my opinion that does not
arise from a proper construction of it and no rational commercial reason is
suggested as to why
it should be adopted.  It is clear that clause 1.2(1) is
speaking of goods to be supplied or services to be rendered by ADI after
the
Completion Date pursuant to a Contract.  That is the reason for the necessity
for the adjustment, viz that the Bank or Stanilite
had already received
pre-payments for the goods to be supplied or the services to be rendered after
the Completion Date, but, pursuant
to the terms of the Agreement, was acquitted
from the obligation of supplying the goods or rendering the services.
Therefore, in
so far as that obligation fell upon ADI there was every
commercial reason to credit ADI with amounts paid to recompense it for the
goods to be supplied or the services to be rendered.  That would be an
obligation it would undertake, at least in all probability,
pursuant to the
assignment and novation of Contracts and for the purpose of protecting its
Goodwill.  However, to suggest that there
should be an adjustment in
circumstances where ADI was under no obligation to supply goods or render
services under the Excluded
Contracts defies commercial rationality and, in my
opinion, it is a construction which must be rejected.  If there is any
ambiguity,
the words of the Agreement will bear, and should receive, the
construction I have given them: <b>Australian Broadcasting Commission v
Australasia Performing Right Association Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a> at
p.109.
<P>

30   	Finally Mr Hadley submitted that the Goodwill of ADI would
be affected because it would not be performing contracts, i.e.
Excluded
Contracts, which, although it was not obliged to perform them, would lead to a
perception that it was not performing the
obligations of Stanilite. In this
way, it was submitted the Goodwill, which was an Asset, would be lessened in
value.  In my view
this does not give rise to an entitlement to any such
adjustment.  ADI could only perform the obligations under the Excluded
Contracts,
and, therefore, take the benefits of pre-payments pursuant to them,
if it acquired them and obtained an assignment or novation of
them.  None of
these things occurred.  Accordingly, no obligations were imposed on ADI in
respect of Excluded Contracts and the Goodwill
it acquired could not be eroded
by the failure to obtain adjustment payments, which is what the submission came
down to.
<P>

31   	In these circumstances I consider that ADI is not entitled
to any of the pre-payments in respect of the Excluded Contracts
and its Further
Amended Summons must be dismissed.
<P>

<b>The Bank's Cross-Claim</b>
<P>

32   	By its Third Further Amended Cross-Claim the Bank sought
to recover $60,000.  The facts agreed were that it was reported to
Mr Madden
that sub-contractors on the Material Contracts were threatening to walk out and
cease performing these contracts and that,
accordingly, Mr Madden paid the
whole amount owing to them for work done <u>prior</u> to the Effective Date so
that they would continue providing services or supplying goods in respect of
the Material Contracts.  The
payments were obviously made after 22 May 1996,
but, equally obviously, in respect of matters occurring prior to the Effective
Date.
 Clause 2.1(1) of Schedule 12 required two occurrences, each after the
Effective Date.  That had not happened and, accordingly, the
requirements of
the clause were not met.
<P>

33   	Mr Reeves' submission was that because the payment was
made to ensure that the sub-contractors continued providing services
or
supplying goods in respect of the Material Contracts the payments were made "in
respect of wages paid, goods supplied or services
rendered under the Material
Contracts after the Effective Date": clause 2.1(1).  In other words his
submission was that the payments
were made to ensure that work would continue
after the Effective Date.  Whilst the words "in respect of" may, in certain
circumstances,
have a wide meaning, they do not, in my opinion, do the work Mr
Reeves' submissions demand in this case.  Accordingly, the Bank's
claim for
$60,000 must fail.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

34   	It was agreed that in the event of my coming to these
conclusions, judgment for $628,248 sought by the Bank in its Third Further
Amended Cross-Claim should be reduced by $60,000 to $568,248.  It was not
disputed that interest on that amount should run from three
months after the
Completion Date, i.e. 19 July 1996.  Interest shall therefore run from 19
October 1996.  Calculated on Supreme Court
rates from 19 October 1996 to 5
November 1999 it amounts to $175,490.58.  It was also not greatly in issue that
ADI should pay the
Bank's costs.   A submission was made in relation to the
Bank's claim for rectification, which claim was not pursued either at an
evidentiary level or on the hearing.  However, in my opinion, that should not
deprive the Bank of its costs of the proceedings in
which it has been
substantially successful.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

35   	I order:-
<P>

1.	Judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff in the sum of
$743,738.58.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

3.	Exhibits be returned.
