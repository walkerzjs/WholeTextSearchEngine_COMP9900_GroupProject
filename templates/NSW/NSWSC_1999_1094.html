<b>5051/98 - ESANDA FINANCE CORPORATION LTD  V  JOHN RAYMOND GIBBONS &amp; 2
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore;  revised 9 November 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This case involves a dispute about the proceeds of
sale of nine buses.  The plaintiff, Esanda, seeks by notice
of motion to strike
out the amended defence in the proceedings as regards six of the buses.  The
first defendant, Mr Gibbons, seeks
leave by notice of motion to file a
cross-claim and join an additional party as cross-claimant.
<P>

<b>The companies</b>
<P>

2  	The proceedings involve a number of companies in the Clifford
Corporation Group.  The third defendant (`Busrent') is a company
the directors
of which are Mr J B Loiterton and Mr I R Hall, and the secretary is Mr C J
Ellis.  The company's shareholder is Clifford
Corporation Ltd.
<P>

3  	The second defendant (`TPI') is a company the directors of which
are Mr I R Hall, Mr J B Loiterton and Mr C J Ellis, as well
as Mr E Lusew and
Mr L E Stewart, and the secretary is Mr C J Ellis.  There is no evidence
identifying the shareholders of TPI, but
the evidence which is before me
indicates that it has the same registered office and address as other companies
which are subsidiaries
of Clifford Corporation.  It is appropriate for the
purposes of the present application to infer that whoever the shareholders are,
TPI is a subsidiary which is part of the Clifford Corporation Group.
<P>

4  	The first defendant's notice of motion seeks to join as a
cross-claimant another company called Austral Pacific Group Ltd (`APG').
 The
directors of this company are Mr J B Loiterton, Mr I R Hall, and Mr C J Ellis
and Mr L E Stewart ceased to be a director on
15 February 1999.  Mr Ellis is
the secretary, and the sole shareholder is Clifford Corporation Ltd.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

5  	Mr Gibbons says that during 1998 TPI supplied seven bus chassis
to APG for the purpose of APG manufacturing and mounting bus
bodies on each
chassis supplied.  TPI supplied the bus chassis to APG on terms, recorded by
invoice, that the property in the bus
bodies manufactured by APG would not pass
to TPI until full payment was received by APG. Additionally, during 1998 APG
manufactured
and sold two complete buses to TPI, on terms that property in the
buses would not pass until APG received full payment.  Mr Gibbons
says APG has
not received full payment for either the seven bus bodies and or the two
buses.
<P>

6  	Late in 1998 TPI and Busrent arranged for Esanda to provide
finance on the security of the nine buses.  The financing arrangement
was by
lease between Busrent and Esanda supported by a guarantee by Clifford
Corporation Ltd.  Esanda and Busrent entered into a
master lease agreement
dated 1 October  1998, apparently signed by Mr Loiterton and Mr Ellis on behalf
of Busrent,  and pursuant
to its terms each bus was leased by separate
contract, at least some of which appear to have been signed by Mr Loiterton and
Mr Ellis
on behalf of Busrent.
<P>

7  	The master lease contained a provision headed `Acknowledgment of
Delivery', by which the lessee agreed that before taking delivery
it would
thoroughly examine the goods and satisfy itself as to their correspondence with
the given description, their quality and
their suitability for the lessee's
purposes, and certify the same in writing to the lessor.  In the case of each
individual bus the
form contained an acknowledgment of delivery which included
a certificate by the lessee declaring and warranting, among other things,
that
the lessee had carefully examined the goods and that they corresponded with
their description and were of a quality and condition
suitable in all respects
for the lessee's purposes. Although there appears to be no express
acknowledgment or warranty on behalf
of the lessee with respect to the lessor's
title to the goods which were the subject of the lease in each case, the
provisions to
which I have referred clearly imply, in my view, an
acknowledgment by the lessee that as between them the lessor had the better
title
to the goods.
<P>

8  	At about the same time that the leasing arrangements were entered
into, Esanda purchased each of the nine buses from TPI.  It
did not deal with
APG, although as I have said, TPI and APG had four common directors at the
time.
<P>

9  	In the second week of December 1998 Esanda became aware that
certain companies in the Clifford Corporation Group had gone into
external
administration.  In fact Heller Financial Services Ltd appointed Mr Gibbons as
receiver and manager of the assets of APG
and of the book debts of Busrent.  An
administrator had also been appointed to TPI. Esanda says by virtue of these
events Busrent
came to be in default under the terms of the master lease
agreement, and consequently under that agreement Esanda immediately became
entitled to repossess the buses.
<P>

10  	Mr Deeble, on behalf of Esanda, visited the premises of Busrent
with a colleague and identified and inspected the buses on
10 December 1998.
The person with whom he spoke at the premises indicated that the receiver
needed to have Esanda's title to the
vehicles substantiated.  On 16 December
1998 Mr Deeble sent Mr Gibbons a facsimile giving particulars of the invoices
by which Esanda
had purchased the buses from TPI.
<P>

11  	On 17 December Esanda's solicitors wrote to Mr Gibbons asserting
that he had failed to deliver up a particular bus which Esanda
had on-sold, or
to allow Esanda to take possession of it, and making a demand that Esanda be
permitted to take possession.  On the
same day Mr Gibbons' solicitors replied
explaining that Mr Gibbons was the receiver and manager of all of the assets of
TPI and that
the particular bus which was the subject of the demand was in the
possession of TPI.  The solicitors asked for evidence of the consent
of the
administrator of TPI under s 440C of the Corporations Law.  In fact, such
consent was forthcoming on 22 December 1998.  The
solicitors also requested a
schedule detailing the payments which Esanda had made to TPI.
<P>

12  	Later on 17 December 1998 the solicitors for Esanda  provided
further information to the solicitors for Mr Gibbons and then
on 18 December
1998 the present proceedings were instituted, after Esanda had not succeeded in
obtaining possession of any of the
buses.  
<P>

13  	On 18 December 1998 Esanda approached the Equity Duty Judge for
abridgment of service of a summons seeking declarations that
it was the owner
of the nine buses and was entitled to immediate possession of them, and an
order that Mr Gibbons do what was necessary
to allow Esanda to take possession.
Esanda also sought an immediate interlocutory order of that kind.  There was a
hearing on that
day at which Mr Gibbons appeared and neither opposed nor
consented to the making of orders.  Windeyer J ordered abridgment of service
and upon Esanda giving the usual undertaking as to damages, ordered Mr Gibbons
to do all things necessary to permit it to take possession
of the buses,
subject to a conditional release by Esanda releasing Mr Gibbons from liability
with respect to the detention of the
buses, and subject also to Esanda
undertaking to notify Mr Gibbons of the sale and sale price of the vehicles.
<P>

14  	Subsequently, possession of the buses was obtained by Esanda for
the purposes of sale and they were sold for a total consideration
of
$1,534,655.  The buses having been sold, the dispute between the parties became
a dispute with respect to the proceeds of sale.
<P>

15  	Subsequently, the matter continued by pleadings and Esanda filed
a Statement of Claim seeking declarations as to its ownership
and entitlement
to immediate possession of the nine buses at the relevant time, together with
damages and an order for payment of
moneys owing by Busrent.
<P>

16  	By his amended defence, Mr Gibbons admitted that six buses were
in the possession of TPI but asserted that three buses were
in the possession
of APG (paragraph 14).  The amended defence said that Esanda was not entitled
to possession of the buses at the
relevant time because Esanda had purchased
the buses from TPI, which did not have title to confer by that transaction
since the buses
were subject to retention provisions in favour of APG.  In
effect, the pleadings raised the question whether on 18 December 1998
Esanda
was entitled to immediate possession of the buses and, more particularly, the
question whether TPI, being in possession of
six of the buses, could raise a
<i>jus tertii</i> in order to defeat Esanda's claim that it was entitled to
possession of them.
<P>

<b>The application</b>
<P>

17  	Esanda filed its notice of motion on 24 June 1999 and Mr Gibbons
filed his notice of motion on 12 July 1999.  By its notice
of motion Esanda
sought leave to proceed against TPI, notwithstanding that it was in
administration, for the purpose of obtaining
a declaration that Esanda was
entitled to immediate possession of the nine buses, and an order that Mr
Gibbons' amended defence be
struck out.  By his Notice of Motion Mr Gibbons
sought an order that APG be joined as a cross-claimant and leave to file a
cross-claim.
 These applications are the subject of the present judgment.
<P>

<b>The `strike out' application</b>
<P>

18  	The principal question before me relates to Esanda's application
to strike out the amended defence by Mr Gibbons. The standard
by which that
application is to be judged was set out in the judgment of Barwick CJ in<b>
</b><i>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964)
112 CLR 125.</a>  Having reviewed the authorities his Honour remarked (at 129) that
`these cases uniformly adhere to the view that the plaintiff ought
not to be
denied access to the customary tribunal which deals with actions of the kind he
brings, unless his lack of a cause of action
- if that be the ground on which
the Court is invited, as in this case, to exercise its power of summary
dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.'
 In the present case, of course, the
question relates to the defence rather than the plaintiff's cause of action.
Barwick CJ referred
to the various formulae which courts have used to
articulate the standard which must be achieved for success in an application of
this kind.  He said (at 130) that `once it appears that there is a real
question to be determined whether of fact or law, and that
the rights of the
parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the
action as frivolous and vexatious
and as an abuse of process.' He contemplated
that the Court may reach a conclusion favourable to the applicant even in a
case where
the conclusion that the other side's claim is futile is reached only
after extensive argument.  He said (at 130) that `argument,
perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it
cannot possibly succeed.'  In the present case
Esanda says that while its application raises some interesting questions of
law, and
the outcome is not obvious from the beginning, nevertheless upon
proper consideration the Court should conclude that the defence
is hopeless and
should be struck out.
<P>

<b>Pleading a <i>jus tertii</i></b>
<P>

19  	Esanda puts its case on the basis of the principle which
precludes reliance on a <i>jus tertii,</i> and also on the broader ground of
estoppel.  As Professor Atiyah has remarked (`A Re-examination of the <i>Jus
Tertii</i> in Conversion' (1955) 18 Mod LR 97,105), standard formulations of
the law in this area hide a `mass of ambiguity', especially as
to the concepts
of <i>jus tertii</i> and right to possession.  The orthodox application of the
<i>jus tertii</i> principle to an action in trover or conversion was explained
in the judgment of Henchman J in<b> </b><i>Henry Berry &amp; Co Pty Limited v
Rushton</i> [1937] SR (Qld) 109, who said (at 119): 
<P>

`although where the plaintiff was in actual possession of the goods when the
defendant by a wrongful act got possession of them
the defendant can plead the
<i>jus tertii</i> only in certain cases ..., it is otherwise when the plaintiff
was not in actual possession when the wrongful act was done.  When
the
plaintiff was not in actual possession, but relies upon his right to
possession, he must recover on the strength of his title,
and the defendant
may, under a plea of not guilty or not possessed, show that the plaintiff has
no right to immediate possession
because that right is in some other
person.'
<P>

20  	In the present case Esanda was not in possession of the buses on
18 December 1998 and the proceedings which it commenced on
that day rely upon
its right to immediate possession, arising under the terms of the master lease
agreement.  The principles stated
by Henchman J, if one were to pause at that
point, would imply that Mr Gibbons would be entitled to raise a <i>jus
tertii</i> by denying Esanda's right to immediate possession on the basis that
TPI did not have good title to the buses when it sold them to
Esanda in
1998.
<P>

21  	However, the principles with respect to <i>jus tertii</i> are
subject to further qualifications.  Henchman J remarked (at 121) that `in cases
of bailment for a term, the bailor has no right
of possession and cannot sue in
trespass or conversion  until the contract is determined.'  In such a case, the
bailee is precluded
from setting up a <i>jus tertii</i> against the bailor.

<P>

22  	The principle behind the rules concerning bailor and bailee has
been explained by Messrs R P Balkin and J L R Davies in Law
of Torts 2 ed
(1996) p 73 as follows:
<P>

`The idea that the <i>jus tertii</i> can be pleaded by a converter of goods as
against a plaintiff with only an immediate right to possession, is subject to
the exception
that a bailee, if sued by the bailor, is estopped from denying
the bailor's title, although some other defence may be available.
Moreover, the
rule that the bailee is not entitled to dispute the bailor's title and
therefore cannot plead the <i>jus tertii</i> against the bailor is itself
subject to certain exceptions. Herron J in Edwards v Amos stated the rule thus:
((1945)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=62%20WN%20NSW%29%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">62 WN NSW) 204</a> at 206):
<P>

`the defendant, although a bailee, can plead the <i>jus tertii</i> in three
cases, (a) where he defends the action on behalf of and by the authority of the
true owner, (b) where he committed the act
of conversion complained of on the
authority of the true owner, and (c) where he has already made satisfaction to
the true owner
by returning the property to him.''
<P>

23  	In my view, though they are expressed by reference to the
particular case of bailor and bailee,  the principles with respect
to pleading
the <i>jus tertii</i> are best understood not as a series of mechanistic rules
but as a series of propositions which relate to the same fundamental concern
for fairness which gives rise to the modern law of equitable estoppel.  An
understanding of the basis of principle should help to
avoid confusion about
the relevant legal concepts.  Essentially, the defendant in an action in
conversion in modern times will be
precluded from pleading and relying upon the
title of a third party in order to defeat the plaintiff's assertion of a right
to immediate
possession, when: 
<P>

(a)	the defendant's conduct has contributed to the plaintiff's belief that its
right to immediate possession exists;  and
<P>

(b)	the defendant does not act with the authority of the true owner.
<P>

24  	It may be that the principle underlying the cases on <i>jus
tertii</i> is an application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  It is
unnecessary for me to decide whether the <i>jus tertii</i> cases are merely
cases of equitable estoppel or have some special characteristics.  It is enough
for present purposes to say that
(assuming the true owner has not intervened)
the cases require, inter alia, an inquiry with respect to the defendant's
conduct, in
order to determine whether there is in that conduct something which
justifies the Court from preventing the defendant from defeating
the
plaintiff's right to immediate possession by pleading or relying upon the
better title of the third party.
<P>

25  	That this is the correct approach is confirmed, in my view, by
the judgment of Walsh J in<b> </b><i>Standard Electronic Apparatus Laboratories
Pty Limited v Stenner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%2077%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20833" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 77 WN (NSW) 833</a>, 836.  That was a case where
the plaintiff in an action for conversion was the bailee of goods which had
been taken by the bailor.
 Walsh J held that the bailee had special property in
the goods in question by virtue of work done on them which had created a lien;
that special property was sufficient to support the action.  The question was
whether the bailor, having entered into the bailment,
could defend the action
by asserting a <i>jus tertii</i>.  His Honour held that the bailor, having
purported to bail the goods to A, could not dispute his own right to do so by
setting up
a <i>jus tertii</i> even if the third party was in fact the true
owner.  His Honour contemplated that the position may have been different had
it been
shown that the true owner demanded the goods or that the bailor was
acting under the authority or direction of the true owner.  In
the case before
him, a claim of that kind had not been made, the bailor merely asserting that
he had not made any agreement with
the bailee in relation to the goods.  Since
this defence had failed and as between the parties to the proceedings the
bailee was
properly in possession, Walsh J held that the bailor should be
precluded by his own conduct from pleading the <i>jus tertii.</i>
<P>

26  	It appears to me that the present case is quite similar to
the<b> </b><i>Standard Electronic</i><b> </b>case.  Here Esanda asserts its
right to immediate possession against Busrent.  In the amended defence it is
admitted that six of the
buses were in the possession of TPI on 18 December
1998.  As far as those buses are concerned, it is not asserted that TPI had any
better right to possession than Busrent.  However TPI, it is said, had no title
to confer upon Esanda in 1998 when it purported to
sell the buses to Esanda
subject to a leasing arrangement in favour of Busrent.  Putting to one side for
the moment the complexity
which arises because there is more than one related
company concerned and a separate party to the proceedings is the receiver and
manager, the case appears as one in which a defendant to an action in which the
plaintiff asserts a right to immediate possession
of goods pleads that the
plaintiff's title, and consequently its right to possession, are defective,
because the defendant had no
title to give when at an earlier time it purported
to sell the goods to the plaintiff.  Viewed in that manner the facts fall
within
the principles enunciated by Walsh J in the<b> </b><i>Standard
Electronic</i><b> </b>case.
<P>

27  	In the present case, however, additional complexity arises out
of the corporate group relationship and the receivership.  As
far as the
corporate group relationship is concerned, TPI can have no better right to
retain possession of the buses than Busrent.
Consequently, any assertion on
behalf of TPI or Busrent challenging Esanda's right to immediate possession is
an assertion of a <i>jus tertii</i> falling within the principles of the cases,
whichever of those two companies makes the assertion.
<P>

28  	Mr Gibbons has not asserted that APG authorised TPI to resist
Esanda's demand for possession on its behalf.  The fact that
there were four
common directors is not of itself a basis for inferring that such authority was
given.
<P>

29  	Both TPI and Busrent were parties to the overall transaction of
October 1998 by which TPI purported to sell the buses to Esanda
for substantial
valuable consideration and Esanda leased the buses to Busrent.  In those
circumstances, it can hardly lie in the
mouth of either TPI or Busrent to
assert now that a part of the transaction in which they both took part was
ineffective because
TPI was not able to confer good title. The facts that Mr
Loiterton and Mr Ellis were signatories to the lease documentation on behalf
of
Busrent, and were also at the  relevant time directors of TPI, merely confirm
this conclusion.
<P>

30  	As far as the position of Mr Gibbons is concerned, it is clear
from the statement of claim that he has been joined as a defendant
in his
capacity of receiver and manager of the assets of TPI and part of the assets of
Busrent (although the latter capacity is not
significant because the
receivership is confined to Busrent's book debts).  By the amended defence Mr
Gibbons admits that he is receiver
and manager of the assets of TPI.  In that
context it is clear that the rights which he purports to assert are not rights
which he
claims as an individual, but are rights asserted in his capacity as
the receiver and manager of the assets of TPI.  In other words,
Mr Gibbons has
no capacity in these proceedings other than as receiver and manager.  And that
being so, his assertion of a <i>jus tertii</i> must effectively be regarded as
an assertion made by TPI through him rather than by him as an individual.
<P>

31  	It appears to me, therefore, that the standard set by the<b>
</b><i>General Steel Industries</i><b> </b>case has been met by Esanda with
respect to six of the buses concerned.  Mr Gibbons submitted that in the
present case the dispute
between the parties relates to difficult questions of
law and some unresolved questions of fact, and consequently, it is not an
appropriate
case for the Court to accede to an application to strike out the
defence.  However, the mere fact that there are difficult questions
of law
involved does not prevent an application to strike out a pleading from
succeeding, for the reasons explained by Barwick CJ
in the<b> </b><i>General
Steel Industries</i> case.  Once one analyses the difficult legal issues, one
may, as I have here, reach the view that the claim which is challenged is
so
clearly untenable that it cannot  possibly succeed.
<P>

32  	As far as unresolved questions of fact are concerned, my view is
that it is unnecessary to determine them in order to reach
a conclusion on
Esanda's application. Mr Gibbons' difficulty flows directly from the
incontrovertible fact that TPI, as part of the
finance lease transaction which
it entered into with Busrent and Esanda, purported to confer good title to the
buses upon Esanda
for the purposes of the lease.  Once one identifies that this
is the case, it flows inexorably that the principles with respect to
<i>jus
tertii</i> should prevent Mr Gibbons as receiver and manager of TPI from making
an assertion inconsistent with TPI's conduct in that respect.
<P>

33  	As regards the remaining three buses, the amended defence denies
that they were in the possession of any defendant because
they were in the
possession of APG on 18 December 1998.  Esanda says in those circumstances the
correct procedure is for it to discontinue
the present proceedings with respect
to these buses, on the basis that APG may seek to recover damages from it in
appropriate proceedings
if it wishes to do so.  In the circumstances, Esanda
says the correct orders are orders that the amended defence of the first
defendant
be struck out, that (on a final basis) the first and second
defendants deliver up to it the six buses which the amended defence admits
to
being in the possession of TPI on 18 December 1998, and that Esanda be granted
leave to discontinue the proceedings against Mr
Gibbons and TPI with respect to
the other three buses.
<P>

<b>The application to join APG as cross-claimant</b>
<P>

34  	I turn to Mr Gibbons' application for leave to join APG as a
cross-claimant and to file a cross-claim.  If I make the orders
which Esanda
seeks, then effectively any cross-claim will be the only substantial remaining
part of the proceedings which is likely
to be contested.  It would be almost as
easy for APG to institute separate proceedings to assert a claim against Esanda
on the basis
of its allegation of a superior title to the buses at the relevant
time.  However, I see no particular objection to that claim being
asserted in
what is left of the present proceedings and therefore I propose to grant leave
to Mr Gibbons to join APG and file a cross-claim
if that is what he is advised
to do.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

35  	Esanda says that Mr Gibbons should be ordered to pay the costs
of the proceedings to date other than costs directly referable
to the three
buses referred to in paragraph 14(b) of the amended defence;  and that as to
the costs referable to those three buses,
Esanda should be ordered to pay costs
because it now wishes to discontinue the proceedings with respect to them.
<P>

36  	It appears to me that Esanda is entitled to the benefit of a
costs order, but the order proposed on its behalf would give it
too much.  My
conclusions in this case were reached only after analysis with the aid of
substantial argument by counsel. The main
point at issue was not an obvious one
at first blush, though in the end I have decided that the defence is
unsustainable upon analysis.
 That being so, my view is that the proper order
as to costs should reflect the fact that Esanda has been successful with
respect
to six of the nine buses but (in effect) unsuccessful with respect to
three of the buses.  The best way to reflect that outcome is
to order Mr
Gibbons as receiver and manager of TPI and Busrent to pay two-thirds of
Esanda's costs of the proceedings to date.
<P>

37  	Esanda submits that its costs should be assessed and paid
forthwith.  It seems to me there is force in that submission because,
if a
cross-claim is filed, the proceedings are not likely to be finally determined
for some time, and yet the orders which I shall
make now are final orders with
respect to six of the buses.  Moreover, it seems likely that any cross-claim
will assert as its principal
ground a claim by APG based upon its alleged
title.  This is essentially a different claim from the one which is the subject
of this
judgment.  I see no good reason for depriving Esanda of the benefit of
my order for costs while that different matter is determined.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

38  	At the hearing of the application on 5 October 1999 counsel for
Esanda handed up short minutes of order which I now initial
and date for
identification. 
<P>

39  	I note for the purposes of the orders that the administrator of
TPI consented by letter dated 22 December 1998 for the purposes
of s 440D of
the Corporations Law to Esanda commencing the present proceedings, and that the
liquidators subsequently appointed to
TPI consented to leave being granted
under s 500 of the Corporations Law on condition that no orders for costs be
made against them
or the company and that no liability be imposed on the
liquidators.
<P>

40  	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	Grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed against the second defendant for the
purpose only of obtaining orders in terms of paragraphs
3 and 4 below.
<P>

2.	Order that the Amended Defence of the first defendant be struck out.
<P>

3.	Order on a final basis that the first and second defendants deliver up to
the plaintiff the vehicles specified in paragraph 14(a)
to the Amended
Defence.
<P>

4.	Grant leave to the plaintiff to discontinue the proceedings against the
first and second defendants with respect to the vehicles
referred to in
paragraph 14(b) of the Amended Defence.
<P>

5.	Order the first defendant to pay two thirds of the plaintiff's costs of the
proceedings to date.
<P>

6.	Direct the costs referred to above be assessed and paid forthwith.
<P>

7.	Grant leave to Austral Pacific Group Limited (In liquidation)(Receiver and
Manager appointed) to file a cross-claim in what is
left of the proceedings.
