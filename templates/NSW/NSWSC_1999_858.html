<b><u>No 70216/98 Regina v Emad Sleiman</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT NO 29  </b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	This judgment arises out of an incident which is alleged to
have occurred in the course of the trial.
<P>

2   	On 7 April 1999, Mr Stacey, who I would regard as having
been the principal witness in the Crown case, was giving evidence.
 The
incident is alleged to have occurred at approximately 1.15 pm on that day, when
Mr Stacey was leaving the courtroom for the
luncheon adjournment.  Mr Stacey
was a protected witness.  In view of that, a procedure had been adopted
whereby, at an adjournment,
the jury left the courtroom first, then Mr Stacey
and then Mr Sleiman.
<P>

3   	It is necessary to describe certain features of the
courtroom.  The courtroom is large.  The dock is situated in the centre
of the
courtroom.  It is elevated.  To the judge's right of the dock there is a tier
of seating accommodation which is also elevated.
 Witnesses left the courtroom
at adjournments by passing between the dock and the tier of seating.  The
closest seating in the tier
is about five feet from the dock.  Because the dock
and the seating are elevated, a person passing between the dock and the seating
would have his head at about the same height as a person seated in the dock or
at the front of the tier of seating.  
<P>

4   	Mr Sleiman's counsel and his solicitor occupied the same
positions at the bar table throughout the trial.  The solicitor sat
at the end
of the bar table with his back to the dock and hard up against it.  Counsel sat
at the side of bar table on the judge's
right and at the extreme end of that
side of the bar table, with the corner of the bar table between counsel and the
solicitor. 
Mr Sleiman was seated above them and was separated from them by the
wooden front wall of the dock and a desk-like structure attached
to the front
of the dock.
<P>

5   	Following the alleged incident, the following events
occurred.  A charge of contempt was formulated.  A statement by Mr Stacey
was
tendered.  A statement by a court security officer, Mr Austen, was tendered.
Mr Austen was cross-examined.  Mr Sleiman's solicitor
gave oral evidence.
Counsel made a statement from the bar table concerning the alleged incident.
It was agreed that the evidence
was closed.  The Crown Prosecutor and counsel
for Mr Sleiman made submissions.  I reserved my decision. 
<P>

6   	The charge, as formulated by the Crown Prosecutor, was as
follows:
<P>

"CHARGE: On 7 April 1999 Emad Sleiman did commit a contempt in the face of the
court, the particulars of which are as follows:
<P>

About 1:15pm proceedings against Emad Sleiman were adjourned. The witness Adam
Stacey was stood down until 9 April 1999. Adam Stacey
walked from the witness
box towards the back of the court at the time Emad Sleiman was in the dock.
<P>

As Adam Stacey was passing Emad Sleiman, Emad Sleiman put his left hand across
his face and said in a threatening manner `you're
fucked' or words very
similar.
<P>

At such time Emad Sleiman knew that Adam Stacey had given evidence for the
prosecution in the case against him, and that Emad Sleiman
knew that Adam
Stacey had not yet completed his evidence".
<P>

7   	The following is an extract from Mr Stacey's statement,
tendered in evidence:
<P>

"About 1.15pm I had completed giving evidence and I was walking from the
witness box towards the back of the court. As I was passing
Emad Sleiman I saw
him put up his left hand across his face and he said to me `You're fucked' or
something very similar.  When he
said this to me I took this as being a threat.
It may <i>(sic)</i> me feel intimated that he did this in the courtroom."
<P>

Mr Stacey was not cross-examined on his statement.  However, the proceedings
were conducted on the basis that his evidence was strenuously
disputed, and I
proceed on that basis.
<P>

8   	The following is an extract from Mr Austen's statement,
tendered in evidence:
<P>

"I saw the witness Stacey excused from the witness box. He left the witness box
and walked beside the dock area where the accused
were sitting. When Stacey
drew level to Sleiman in the dock I saw Sleiman put his left thumb across the
side of his nose and his
fingers covering his face. He spoke three to four
words to Stacey which sounded threatening. The words were similar to `Fuck you
or you are fucked'.  ... When this occurred I was about 5 feet away from where
Sleiman was in the dock."
<P>

Mr Austen was cross-examined.  His account was challenged.  Under
cross-examination, he said that the distance between Mr Sleiman
and himself at
the time of the episode was about five and a half feet.  He conceded that Mr
Sleiman's counsel and solicitor were
both closer than he was to Mr Sleiman at
the relevant time.  He also conceded that the solicitor would have been in a
better position
than he was to hear anything Mr Sleiman may have said at the
relevant time.
<P>

9   	Mr Sleiman's counsel stated from the bar table that neither
he nor the solicitor heard Mr Sleiman utter the words attributed
to him by Mr
Stacey and Mr Austen.  I accept that statement without reservation.
<P>

10   	Mr Sleiman's solicitor was called to give oral evidence.
Asked whether he heard the alleged words being uttered, he replied,
"No, I
don't <i>(sic</i>), I may have been speaking with Mr Horler but I don't recall
it."
<P>

11   	I apply the criminal standard of proof.  I accept the
evidence of Mr Stacey and Mr Austen.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt
that Mr Sleiman uttered the words "You are fucked" or "You're fucked" in a
threatening tone of voice, shielding his face with
his hand at the time.  There
is a significant difference between the import of an expletive such as "fuck
you" and a threat such
as "you're fucked".  I mean to find explicitly that the
words uttered were the latter.
<P>

12   	I do not agree with Mr Austen's opinion that Mr Sleiman's
counsel and solicitor were in a better position than he was to hear
anything
that may have been said by Mr Sleiman to Mr Stacey as Mr Stacey walked between
Mr Sleiman and Mr Austen.  First, according
to the evidence of Mr Stacey and Mr
Austen, the words would have been spoken to Mr Sleiman's left and in the
direction of Mr Austen
as Mr Stacey passed between the two men, rather than
forward in the direction of counsel and solicitor.  Secondly, the heads of Mr
Sleiman, Mr Austen and Mr Stacey, as Mr Stacey passed between the other two,
would have been at about the same level, whereas counsel
and solicitor were
seated at a lower level.  Thirdly, according to Mr Stacey and Mr Austen, Mr
Sleiman was shielding his face with
his hand, presenting a barrier in the
direction of counsel and solicitor but not in the direction of Mr Stacey and Mr
Austen.  Fourthly,
counsel and solicitor were shielded from Mr Sleiman by the
barrier of the solid woodwork at the front of the dock to which I have
referred.  Fifthly, as the solicitor suggested in his evidence, counsel and
solicitor may have been talking between themselves at
the time, or they might
have been otherwise preoccupied.  
<P>

13   	For these reasons, I think it is entirely consistent that
the words were uttered as alleged and that counsel and solicitor
did not hear
them.  Neither did I, but I was a considerable distance away, and I have no
reason to think that my attention was directed
to that part of the courtroom at
the time.  I do not think there is any inconsistency between the evidence of Mr
Stacey and Mr Austen,
on the one hand, and my not having observed the incident,
on the other.
<P>

14   	What occurred constitutes a contempt of court.  In
<i>European Asia Bank</i> <i>AG v Wentworth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 445</a> at 450,
Kirby P said:
<P>

"There is no doubt that it is a serious contempt to interfere with a witness by
words or actions, in such a way as to diminish or
question the privilege of the
witness to give evidence to a court without fear or favour. The courts have
repeatedly stressed that
they will preserve the freedom and integrity of
witnesses. They will not allow them to be intimidated from giving their
evidence
either before a trial, at the hearing or after the trial is
concluded..."
<P>

In <i>Moore v Clerk of Assize, Bristol</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20WLR%201669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 WLR 1669</a> at 1670, Denning
MR said:
<P>

"The court will always preserve the freedom and integrity of witnesses and not
allow them to be intimidated in any way, either before
the trial, pending it or
after it...it is also a contempt of court to threaten him or put him in fear;
if it is done so as to punish
him for what he has said".
<P>

15   	A procedural question arises.  Pt 55, Contempt of the
Supreme Court rules, includes Division 2, Contempt in the face or hearing
of
the court, and Division 3, Motion or proceedings for punishment.
<P>

16   	Division 2 provides for a trial judge to deal with a
question of contempt without procedural formality.  Division 3 provides
for a
question of contempt to be dealt with by motion on notice.  Division 2 is
predicated upon a contempt having occurred in the
face or hearing of the court.
The authorities deal with whether that means the judge must himself or herself
have observed the conduct
in question.  In <i>Registrar, Court of Appeal v</i>
<i>Collins </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 682</a>, Moffitt P (with whom Street CJ and Hope JA
agreed) said (at 707) that contempt in the face of the court may include
conduct which
takes place outside the court room, necessarily implying that the
conduct in question does not have to be observed by the judge in
order to
constitute contempt in the face of the court.  However, in<i> Fraser v The
Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20NSWLR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3 NSWLR 212</a>, Kirby P and McHugh JA, in a joint judgment,
doubted the correctness of the decision in <i>Collins</i> on this point.
Mahoney JA dissented.  The point remains unsettled.  In<i> European Asia
Bank</i>, Priestley JA said (at 463):
<P>

"It is obviously desirable that the point be settled one way or the other as
soon as may be. Until the question is settled I find
it difficult to see that
any judge confronted with the question at first instance could be criticised
for adopting either view".
<P>

The proceedings in relation to the alleged contempt have been conducted without
procedural formality, conformably with Division
2.  There was no objection to
this course.  In particular, there was no point taken that the charge should be
brought by motion on
notice.  I proceed pursuant to Division 2.  
<P>

17   	Having regard to the findings I have made and the
authorities to which I have referred, I find Mr Sleiman guilty of contempt
as
charged.
