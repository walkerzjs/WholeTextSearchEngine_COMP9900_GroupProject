SENTENCE
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Each of the prisoners Nitin Giri and Ivesh Karki
stood trial charged with the murder of Sajedul Haque at Kings
Cross on 22 June
1996.  The jury found each prisoner guilty and each was convicted accordingly.
Following conviction on 5 September
1999 the prisoners were remanded in custody
for evidence and submissions on sentence.  The further hearing took place on 16
December
1999.
<P>

2  	The deceased, Sajedul Haque, was subjected to a violent assault
after he left a nightclub in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross
early on the
morning of 22 June 1996.  He was knocked to the ground and thereafter he was
kicked.  According to one witness he was
also stomped upon.
<P>

3  	The deceased sustained severe head injuries and was admitted to
St Vincent's Hospital where he was found to be deeply unconscious,
a condition
from which he never recovered.
<P>

4  	Dr Cala conducted the post mortem examination upon the deceased
and found the cause of death to be complications of the injuries
the deceased
had sustained to the head and face.  Dr Cala identified those injuries as
including:
<P>

(i)	an abrasion below the right eye;
<P>

(ii)	abrasion and bruising of the right forehead;
<P>

(iii)	bruising above the middle of the forehead;
<P>

(iv)	bruising to the left side of the forehead;
<P>

(v)	abrasions to the nose;
<P>

(vi)	laceration below the left eye;
<P>

(vii)	bruising over the left cheek;
<P>

(viii)	bruising of the jaw;
<P>

(ix)	bruising in the vicinity of the left ear;
<P>

(x)	haematoma to the right and left peri orbital areas;
<P>

(xi)	bruising of the left hand;
<P>

(xii)	fractured left cheek;
<P>

(xiii)	brain damage caused by trauma to the head.
<P>

5  	In the opinion of Dr Cala all the injuries found were consistent
with the deceased having been assaulted, and the evidence established
beyond
reasonable doubt that the injuries were so caused.  The verdict of the jury
inculpates both prisoners in their infliction.
 However Dr Cala was unable to
determine what impact or impacts caused the brain damage that led to the death
of the deceased.
<P>

6  	The deceased was a young man twenty-seven years of age who came
from Bangladesh.  He visited Kings Cross with friends from Bangladesh
on the
night of 21 June 1996.  The party visited the "Illusions" nightclub and it was
here that there was an altercation that involved
the deceased and the prisoner
Ivesh Karki.  It seems that the deceased laughed at the way this prisoner's
brother was dancing and
exception was taken to this reaction.
<P>

7  	Later there was a confrontation between the deceased and his
friends and the prisoner Ivesh Karki and his companions outside
the Kings Cross
Hotel where Ivesh Karki and the deceased held on to each other.
<P>

8  	Later still there was a further confrontation outside the
nightclub Illusions and the deceased and his friends were followed
into
Illusions by both the prisoners and their Nepalese companions.  It was when the
deceased left Illusions for the second time
that the fatal assault occurred.
The deceased was followed from Illusions by the prisoners and a number of their
companions.  There
were a number of eye-witness accounts of what then occurred
and, not unexpectedly, there were differences in the various accounts
of these
eye-witnesses.  However, it is clear from the jury's verdict that the jury was
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both
prisoners were inculpated in the
assault upon the deceased who, as the evidence establishes, was affected by
intoxicating liquor
at the time.
<P>

9  	Because the medical evidence did not establish which act or acts
of violence caused death, the jury was directed that it could
only find either
prisoner guilty if in the case of that prisoner the jury was satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the act or acts
causing death were performed in a joint
criminal enterprise in which the particular prisoner was participating and that
that prisoner
either
<P>

(i)	shared a common intention with the other participant(s) of causing death or
grievous bodily harm to the deceased, or
<P>

(ii)	contemplated the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm by one or
other of the participants as a possible incident
in the joint criminal
enterprise.
<P>

10  	It is clear from the jury's verdict that it was satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that each prisoner for relevant purposes
was a participant in
the joint criminal enterprise in which the fatal injuries were sustained.
<P>

11  	This is a significant matter because Mr Walsh, on behalf of the
prisoner Nitin Giri, submitted I should assess his client's
criminality as
being less than that of Ivesh Karki.  I have concluded I should not approach my
sentencing task on this basis.
<P>

12  	When interviewed by the police, Ivesh Karki admitted he struck
and kicked the deceased, kicking him <i>"once"</i>.  When interviewed by the
police, Nitin Giri admitted that he struck the deceased causing him to fall to
the ground.  He conceded
he may have kicked the deceased <i>"if somebody else
has seen me"</i>.  Neither prisoner gave evidence at the trial.
<P>

13  	The eye-witness evidence, as I assess it, proved that both
prisoners kicked the deceased after he fell.  Rahman Mahbubur said
that after
the deceased fell down both prisoners kicked him.  Darren Diolosa also said
that there were two men kicking the deceased
on the ground, that each kicked
the deceased four times and, from the way they were moving, these men were
putting a lot of weight
into their kicks.  Jim Diamond said that two men kicked
the deceased on the ground, one man kicking him once and the other kicking
him
two or three times.  Sheikh Islam said that he saw both prisoners kick the
deceased.  Daniel Thompson described a frenzied kicking
attack and he
specifically recalled that <i>"Ponytail" </i>(that is, Nitin Giri) kicked the
deceased.  He said that the assault on the deceased ended when the deceased was
stomped on the head
three times.  Simon Page, who had been at an automatic
teller machine at a bank, arrived later than his companion Daniel Thompson,
but
he remembered one, maybe two, men kicking the deceased on the ground.  Orapai
Taria saw two men kicking the deceased on the ground
and each kicked him more
than once. Anthony Bayes only saw one man kick the deceased on the ground.
<P>

14  	Allowing for the discrepancies in the eye-witness versions, I am
nevertheless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence
given at the
trial that both prisoners kicked the deceased as he lay upon the ground.
<P>

15  	Mr Walsh referred to the evidence of Mr Thompson and Mr Page in
support of the submission that his client should be viewed
more favourably than
Ivesh Karki in assessing the objective gravity of the crime as the evidence
pointed to Ivesh Karki being the
one who stomped on the deceased.  He also
submitted that the evidence did not establish that Nitin Giri became involved
in events
until he and Ivesh Karki met up with the deceased outside Illusions
before the deceased entered that place for the second time. 
These features, he
submitted, warranted the conclusion that Nitin Giri's criminality was less than
that of Ivesh Karki.  I am not
persuaded that this is so.  Each man
participated in what was a savage and cowardly assault upon the unfortunate
victim who, after
he was knocked to the ground, was kicked by each prisoner as
he lay defenceless and unconscious.  Each prisoner had the requisite
intent for
the crime of murder.  Each prisoner committed a crime which, viewed
objectively, was extremely serious.
<P>

16  	The sentences that I impose must recognise the objective gravity
of what was done and must address in an adequate manner the
consideration of
deterrence.  These observations apply equally in the case of each prisoner.
<P>

17  	I turn to consider the subjective features of each offender.
<P>

<b>Ivesh Karki</b>
<P>

18  	Ivesh Karki was born on 2 June 1976.  The pre sentence report
prepared following conviction, and dated 26 November 1999 records
in summary
the prisoner's background and I draw upon it to outline this background.  This
prisoner was born in Nepal where he was
brought up, the son of a prominent
figure in Nepal.  His father is the Secretary of the Forestry Commission.  The
prisoner was educated
at a prominent and prestigious boarding school in India.
Having completed his studies there he came to Australia to study for a business
studies diploma with the intention of returning to Nepal to assume
responsibility for family business interests.  The prisoner was
part way
through the course when his studies were interrupted by the commission of this
crime and its consequences.  Since he has
been in Australia, apart from
attending to the study referred to, the prisoner has worked with a fast food
outlet for some six months
and as a cleaner for some two years.  In the period
he has been in custody since his conviction, the prisoner has pursued study and
the education officer at Parklea has assessed him as being an excellent student
with a high level of commitment to his studies.
<P>

19  	The author of the pre sentence report has reported that the
information gathered by him indicates that the offence was out
of character for
this prisoner.
<P>

20  	The prisoner was assessed by a psychologist, Dr Duffy.  The
prisoner gave this witness an account of his involvement with the
deceased
which is not consistent with the evidence led by the Crown at the trial and
which evidence I accept.  In particular the
prisoner told Dr Duffy he did not
intend to hurt the deceased and that he was afraid of the deceased.  Plainly
the jury found the
prisoner had the requisite intent and what the prisoner did
in following the deceased and in assaulting him was inconsistent with
the fear
he asserted that he entertained at the time he consulted Dr Duffy.
Nevertheless, although the prisoner appears to have been
less than frank with
Dr Duffy about the circumstances of this crime, the concluding paragraph in the
psychologist's report is noteworthy:
<P>

<i>"Whilst in custody, Ivesh has taken advantage of courses offered to him such
as anger management and drug and alcohol counselling.
 The major problem for
him, however, is reconciling what he has done with the shame and humiliation
this has caused him and his family
back in Nepal.  He still seems to be unable
to come to terms with this and has avoided speaking to his father since his
arrest and
has not been able to tell his mother about the Court proceedings.
He will need some supportive counselling from a psychologist, particularly
following his sentence.  Ivesh is eager to make amends and is prepared to
assume all the responsibilities of study and work when
he returns home to his
family."</i>
<P>

21  	This prisoner gave evidence on the hearing on sentence.  He said
that he had been drinking on the night of the offence and
that he had had half
a bottle of vodka and a quantity of beer.  The prisoner was cross examined
about this account of what he had
been drinking and about what he had said to
the police on this topic during the later interview.  
<P>

22  	The evidence certainly does not establish that the prisoner was
intoxicated but Mr Cusack made it clear that evidence of alcohol
intake was led
not in an effort to excuse the prisoner's behaviour but by way of possible
explanation for it, bearing in mind the
prisoner's prior good character.
Assessing the evidence in point, I am prepared to accept that the prisoner had
been drinking and
that this may have loosened his inhibitions.
<P>

23  	The prisoner said that relations with his father were strained
before the commission of this offence and although he used to
communicate with
his mother since his arrest he has not communicated with his parents because of
his sense of shame about what has
happened.  I accept that the prisoner is
ashamed and I accept also that he entertains genuine contrition for what he has
done.
<P>

24  	I am satisfied that this prisoner is a man of prior good
character and that the commission of this crime has already had, and
will
continue to have, tragic consequences for him.
<P>

25  	Mr Cusack submitted that I should find special circumstances in
this case.  Of particular relevance is the prisoner's age,
his background as I
have reviewed it, and the need for extended supervision in the interests of the
prisoner's rehabilitation after
what must be a lengthy period in custody in the
case of a person who has never been in prison before.  I accept that there are
special
circumstances.
<P>

<b>Nitin Giri</b>
<P>

26  	This prisoner was born on 17 September 1976.  I draw on his pre
sentence report dated 19 November 1999 to record his background.
 He too was
born in Nepal and he too comes from a privileged background.  His family own a
tea plantation and the family has developed
a reputation for generosity,
benevolence and support of community projects in Nepal.  It seems that the
prisoner himself was involved
in community projects before he left Nepal.  The
prisoner studied to year ten level at a college in Kathmandu but then came to
Australia
in February 1996 to study for his Higher School Certificate.  He
enrolled at the TAFE at Granville College for this purpose and he
obtained part
time work at a fast food outlet where it seems he was well regarded because he
was promoted (after the commission of
this offence) to the position of Trainee
Manager.
<P>

27  	The author of the pre sentence report has concluded that the
prisoner is a young man who <i>"apart from his involvement in this offence
appears to have led a responsible and dutiful lifestyle"</i>.  The author added
that the prisoner <i>"appears conscientious and devoted to his family with
concern about them being foremost in his thoughts."</i>
<P>

28  	The prisoner gave evidence on the hearing on sentence.  He too
expressed his contrition and his shame concerning his involvement
in this
offence.  I accept that the expression of these sentiments was genuine.
<P>

29  	This prisoner has been supported since the commission of this
offence by his brother, Nabin Giri, who has come to Australia
and who gave
evidence on the hearing on sentence.  According to Nabin Giri, his brother will
not be left completely without support
after sentence is imposed because there
is a cousin living in Australia who will afford, with friends, some measure of
support. 
Nabin Giri however will be returning to Nepal.
<P>

30  	Dr Waters, psychiatrist, assessed this prisoner on two
occasions, in July 1996 and again in November 1999.  On the first of
these
assessments the prisoner expressed shame for what he had done and the dishonour
he has caused his family.  He also expressed
his contrition.  When last seen,
the prisoner presented with what Dr Waters has assessed to be an adjustment
disorder with depression.
 In the doctor's opinion, this prisoner will have
particular difficulty in serving his sentence.
<P>

31  	It has been submitted that I should find special circumstances
in the case of Nitin Giri.  Like Ivesh Karki this prisoner is
a man of previous
good character with no prior convictions.  He is a young man who is about to be
sentenced to a lengthy term of
imprisonment.  In the interests of his
rehabilitation he will need an extended period of supervision when he is
released.  As in
the case of Ivesh Karki, I am satisfied that there are special
circumstances for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.
<P>

32  	Evidence was introduced concerning the fact that the prisoner
co-operated in providing a statement and subsequently in giving
evidence under
subpoena at a criminal trial in the District Court.  The subject matter of the
statement and the trial was an offence
of a sexual nature committed in premises
in which the prisoner was living at the relevant time.  It was not suggested
that the prisoner
was in any way involved in this offence and it was another
person who stood trial for it.  From the material placed before me, the
evidence which the prisoner was able to give assisted neither the prosecution
nor the accused.  Mr Walsh did not contend that the
prisoner's involvement in
this matter is of great significance nor do I consider this to be the case.  I
suppose that it does show
a measure of responsibility in that it reflected a
willingness on the part of the prisoner to co-operate with the police and to
give
evidence when called upon to do so.  I take this into account.
<P>

33  	Each prisoner has been in custody continually since the jury
returned with its verdict on 15 September 1999.  Each prisoner
was taken into
custody for one night during the trial in circumstances and for reasons which
it is unnecessary to state for present
purposes.  Each prisoner had spent time
in custody between the date of arrest and the date of the grant of bail.  Nitin
Giri was
arrested on 24 June 1996 and was granted bail on 8 August 1996.  He
then remained on bail until the trial.  Ivesh Karki was in custody
following
his arrest on 24 June 1996 until 24 October 1996 when he was admitted to bail.
He then remained on bail, like Nitin Giri,
until the date of his trial.  It is
to be observed then that Ivesh Karki has spent longer in custody so far than
Nitin Giri.  However
assessing overall the objective and subjective features in
both cases, I have concluded that I should impose the same sentence in
each
case.  I do so alert to the periods each prisoner spent in custody before being
admitted to bail and I do so intending to backdate
each sentence to commence on
15 September 1999.
<P>

34  	It has been urged on behalf of each of these prisoners that
imprisonment will impose exceptional hardship because each prisoner
is going to
be incarcerated away from home in a foreign country.  The Crown acknowledged
that this is a relevant consideration as
was urged by both Mr Cusack and Mr
Walsh.
<P>

35  	In <i>Ferrer-Esis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2055%20A%20Crim%20R%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 55 A Crim R 231</a> Hunt J, as he then
was, with whose judgment the Chief Justice and the Chief Judge at Common Law
agreed, said at 239 that the fact
that the respondent in that case was to be
incarcerated in a foreign country was not a circumstance to be attributed
<i>"very much weight"</i>.  In that case however the offender appears to have
come to Australia for the purpose of importing a prohibited drug.  More
recently
in <i>Jelks</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 1 December 1995), Hidden J, with
whom the other members of the court agreed, commenting upon the fact of
incarceration
in a foreign country, said:
<P>

<i>"As to the undoubtedly invidious position of a foreign national in prison in
this country, the most anyone in this court has ever
said is that very little
weight can be given to that fact:  see Ferrer-Esis in the judgment of the Chief
Judge at Common Law at 239."</i>
<P>

36  	In <i>Kogelbauer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2065%20A%20Crim%20R%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 65 A Crim R 357</a>, a decision to which
Hidden J referred in <i>Jelks</i>, it was submitted that the prisoner should
have attracted a shorter sentence because, being a foreign national, his
security progression
through the gaol system would be restricted, and he could
never progress beyond a C1 classification, with the consequence that he
would
have to serve his entire period in custody quite confined by a physical
barrier.  The members of the Court of Criminal Appeal
in that case were not in
agreement about the significance of this for sentencing purposes.  Meagher JA
considered this ought not
to be taken into account.  Hunt CJ at CL considered
it was relevant to take into account loss of the usual progression through the
prison system.  Sully J appears to have agreed with Meagher JA.  
<P>

37  	The only other authority to which I have been referred is
<i>Brown</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 13 July 1993).  This case went on appeal on
the issue of the severity of the sentence imposed at first instance.
 The
appeal was dismissed.  One of the matters that had been taken into account by
the sentencing judge was that a sentence would
be more onerous upon him because
of his race and culture and the appellate court did not conclude that the trial
judge had erred
in this approach.
<P>

38  	I have regard to the concession of the Crown to which I referred
earlier and I recognise that the facts in the present case
can be distinguished
from <i>Ferrer-Esis</i> because neither of these prisoners came to this country
for the purpose of committing a crime.  I am satisfied that in the case of
each
prisoner incarceration is going to be more difficult for him away from his
native land.  This I will take into account.
<P>

39  	The pre sentence reports in the case of each of these prisoners
disclose that the Department of Immigration has stated that
each prisoner will
be deported once he is released from custody.  However, as I understand the
authorities, this prospect of deportation
ought not influence the sentence
which I pass.  In <i>R v Shrestha</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%2d91%29%20173%20CLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990-91) 173 CLR 48</a>, the offender,
coincidentally a resident of Nepal, was convicted in Western Australia of three
drug offences against s 233B of the
<i>Customs Act</i>.  The judge at first
instance declined to order that the prisoner become eligible for parole but the
Court of Criminal Appeal determined
otherwise.  An application for special
leave to appeal to the High Court was refused.  It was determined that there
was no rule that
it was inappropriate for a foreign offender, who had no ties
in Australia and whose only purpose in entering Australia was to commit
serious
crime, to be eligible for parole.  It was pointed out in that case also that
policy may change between the date of sentence
and the date of expiration of
sentence.  Moreover in the course of their joint judgment Deane, Dawson and
Toohey JJ said at 69:
<P>

<i>"It would be closing one's eyes to reality to deny that the parole system is
sometimes abused and is often ineffective.  Nonetheless,
in a society where
imprisonment for the punishment of crime is accepted as being sometimes
unavoidable, the parole system represents
an important influence for the reform
and rehabilitation of those in gaol.  In a case where subsequent eligibility
for parole is
not precluded by order of the sentencing judge, the indeterminate
nature of the period (within the confines of the head sentence)
which will
actually be served in custody provides the offender with `a basis for hope of
earlier release and in turn an incentive
for rehabilitation' (see Bugmy v The
Queen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 525</a> at 536).  From this flow two significant and valuable
consequences.  The first is that the prisoner is likely to be better behaved
while in confinement.  The second is that a prisoner who retains at least some
degree of control over his future fortunes and who
has a real incentive to
reform is more likely to retain basic self respect and to enjoy some real
prospects of eventual rehabilitation.
 In the harsh context of a prison
environment, the potential advantages - in terms of hope, self esteem,
incentive for reform and
rehabilitation - which eligibility for release on
parole offers a prisoner in an Australian gaol should not be
underestimated.</i>
<P>

<i>The mitigation of sentence which the parole system allows is ordinarily
directed towards rehabilitation.  It is not, however, exclusively
so.
Circumstances can arise in which mitigation of sentence by release on parole is
justified upon purely compassionate grounds.
 An obvious example is where a
prisoner who has become eligible for release on parole is terminally ill.
Another example is where
the severe illness or other unusual needs of the
spouse or infant children of a prisoner are strong grounds for release.  It is
true
that it is only in exceptional circumstances that the mitigation of
punishment for reasons of compassion, rather than rehabilitation,
will justify
release on parole.  Where those reasons exist, however, they can be
all-important.  An inability on the part of the
authorities to take them into
account at all may devastate an individual and brutalize the prison system.  It
is a real benefit of
the parole system that it enables some compassion to be
exercised, if necessary, when a prisoner has reached the stage of eligibility
for release on parole."</i>
<P>

40  	Their Honours went on to say:
<P>

<i>"This country has a direct and significant interest in the well-being and
rehabilitation of all who are detained within its gaols,
whether or not their
origins, ties or future prospects lie in this or in some other country.  It
also has a responsibility, both
moral and under international treaty, to treat
all who are subjected to criminal proceedings in its courts or imprisonment in
its
gaols humanely and without discrimination based on national or ethnic
origins (see e.g. International Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of
Racial Discrimination: (1965), Art. 5(a); Reg v Binder <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1990/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] VicRp 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20VR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] VR 563</a> at
569-570).  To deny foreign offenders of the kind in question the opportunity
for the amelioration of their situation and the incentive
for reform and
rehabilitation which the parole system offers is not to differentiate by
reference to degrees of criminality or prospects
of rehabilitation.  It is to
discriminate against prisoners of that class because of their origins, their
place of residence and
their family ties."</i>
<P>

41  	In <i>Liang</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 2 June 1995) the prisoner
was illegally in the country.  Sully J, with whom the other members of the
court agreed,
said at p 4 of his judgment:
<P>

<i>"There is clear law to the effect that the court is not entitled to take the
respondent's immigration status into account in actually
determining what it
considers to be an actual sentence warranted in law..."</i>
<P>

42  	More recently in <i>Jap</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 20 July 1998)
Sully J, with whose judgment Smart J agreed, said this at p 3:
<P>

<i>"I think that the course of authority dealing with that vexed and difficult
question of liability to deportation of foreign nationals
committing criminal
offences in this country, has settled, at least broadly, the principle that
whether such a person will or will
not be deported at the end of an appointed
minimum term is not a matter for the courts, but is a matter for the executive
government;
and that, so far as the courts are concerned, such a person should
be dealt with as though he or she were a national of this country,
it being
left to the proper processes of the executive government, and the public
administration machine otherwise, to deal with
the question of
deportation."</i>
<P>

43  	There has been unanimity at the Bar table in the course of
submissions that whether or not these prisoners face deportation
at the end of
any minimum term which I fix is not a relevant consideration for me any more
than it would be a relevant consideration
for the Parole Board when eventually
considering their release:  as to the position of the Board see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17(2)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.  In my opinion the correct approach requires that I
proceed to sentence putting aside consideration of possible deportation of
either
prisoner upon release from custody.
<P>

44  	Having weighed the objective and subjective circumstances
concerning each of these prisoners, I have concluded that the appropriate
total
sentence in each case is one of penal servitude for seventeen years.  Finding
as I do special circumstances in each case, I
fix a minimum term in each case
of twelve years and an additional term of five years.
<P>

45  	Accordingly in the case of each prisoner I impose sentence as
follows:  I sentence each prisoner to a minimum term of twelve
years penal
servitude commencing on 15 September 1999 and to expire on 14 September 2011
and an additional term of five years to
commence on 15 September 2011 and to
expire on 14 September 2016.  I specify 15 September 2011 as the first date
upon which the prisoner
is to be eligible for release upon parole.
