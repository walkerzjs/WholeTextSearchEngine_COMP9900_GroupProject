<b>4668/98  -  NOROTON HOLDINGS PTY LTD  v  SYDNEY LAND CORPORATION PTY
LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  By an amended summons the plaintiff applies under s 459G of the
Corporations Law to set aside a statutory demand
dated 10 October 1998 and
served on or about 26 October 1998.  The summons was originally filed on 16
November and was subsequently
amended to refer to the correct notice and date
of service.
<P>

2	The summons claimed that the plaintiff owed the defendant $423,129.  The debt
was described in the demand as:
<P>

	"Amount owing on loan account being cash advances as at 30 June 1996 recorded
in the books of the creditor and verified by Messrs
Hennessy Brigden &amp; Co,
chartered accountants, no part of which has been repaid as per schedule annexed
hereto and marked 'A'
headed Sydney Land Corp Inter Co Receivables and Payables
as at 30 June 1996".
<P>

3	Annexed to the demand was a list of inter-company receivables and payables
for the Sydney Land Corp as at 30 June 1996.  One line
in that list refers to
"cash advances - NHPL" and under the heading "Sydney" there appears the figure
$423,129.  The plaintiff does
not dispute that "NHPL" refers to the plaintiff
and "Sydney" refers to the defendant, and that the list has the effect of
asserting
that as at 30 June 1996 $423,129 was owed by the plaintiff to the
defendant.
<P>

4	Though the evidence of corporate structures is skimpy, it appears that the
defendant was for a time the chief entity of a group
that included the
plaintiff.  As the annexure to the statutory demand shows, there were
substantial debts owing by various group
companies to others in the group.
Gregory Lindsay-Owen and Tracy John Lake were directors of the defendant.
<P>

5	At some point after 30 June 1996 the group structure was broken up and
certain subsidiaries were acquired by Australasian Property
Holdings Limited
(APH), a New Zealand company.  Mr Lake is a director of APH and interests
associated with him have a significant
shareholding in that company.  Mr
Lindsay-Owen is a director of the defendant and apparently has no interest in
APH.  The present
litigation arises out of the break-up of the group and the
consequent unravelling of the various inter-company loan accounts.
<P>

6	The plaintiff acknowledges that an amount of $423,129 was owing to the
defendant at 30 June 1996.  However, the plaintiff says
that there are some
adjustments to be made to that amount and further that there are some
offsetting claims so that the balance owing
as at 25 February 1999 was
$190,873.80.  By a letter of that date the plaintiff's solicitor tendered
payment of $190,873.62 by bank
cheque.  The shortfall of 18 cents was a mistake
which counsel for the plaintiff corrected by offering to pay that amount
immediately.
<P>

7	According to the plaintiff the sum of $423,129 must be adjusted by adding two
further amounts explained in Mr Lake's affidavit
of 22 February 1999.  Those
additional amounts are $5,000 with respect to John Brown Tourism and air fares
to New Zealand of $1,358,
bringing the total owing to $429,487.  However, two
amounts must be deducted from that amount.  First, there is a repayment of
$19,109.20
which Mr Lake says is a payment which was made on 5 June 1996 and
acknowledged in a demand by Mr Lindsay-Owen which he refers to
in annexure B to
his affidavit of 16 November 1998.  The second amount is $1,145 which is a
payment which was duplicated and the
adjustment is made to remove the
duplication.  When those two amounts are deducted from the amount owing at 30
June 1996, the balance
outstanding is $409,232.80.
<P>

8	The plaintiff says that it has three offsetting claims with respect to this
balance.  When the offsetting claims are deducted
the balance due and payable
is, as I have said, $190,873.80 and that amount has been paid.
<P>

9	According to the plaintiff the offsetting claims arise out of debts owed by
the defendant to companies which were part of the
defendant's corporate group
when the debts were incurred.  The creditor companies evidently ceased to be
part of the defendant's
group when the group was split up.  The plaintiff says
that it took assignments of these debts; and that by virtue of the assignments
the debts came to be owed by the defendant to it and are offsetting claims.
<P>

10	This contention relies on subsections 459H(1), (2), (4) and (5) of the
Corporations Law.  By s 459H(1) certain calculations must
be made by the Court
if, inter alia, it is satisfied that the debtor company has an offsetting
claim.  "Offsetting claim" is defined
in subsection (5) to mean a genuine claim
that the company has against the respondent by way of counter-claim, set-off or
cross-demand
(even if it does not arise out of the same contractual
circumstances as a debt to which the demand relates).
<P>

11	Where s 459H applies, s 459H(2) says that the Court must calculate the
substantiated amount of the demand by deducting the offsetting
total (the total
amount of the offsetting claims) from the admitted total.  If the substantiated
amount exceeds the statutory minimum
of $2,000, as it does here, the Court is
to make an order under s 459H(4) varying the demand.
<P>

12	In my opinion s 459H speaks from the date of the hearing rather than the
date of service of the demand, so that an offsetting
claim which arises after
the demand is served and even after the proceedings to set it aside are
commenced, but before the hearing,
is to be taken into account:  see
<i>Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustee WA Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/468.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 468</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20ACSR%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 ACSR 194</a>, 204
(Heerey J); <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/1366.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 1366</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 16 ACLC 12</a>, 30 (Full Federal Court).  Subsection (1)
requires that the Court must be satisfied that the defendant "has" an
offsetting claim;
and an "offsetting claim" is defined as a genuine claim that
the company "has" against the respondent.  A claim based on an assigned
debt is
at least a "cross-demand" arising out of a different transaction or
circumstances than the amount of the debt which is claimed,
and as such falls
within the definition of "offsetting claim" even if it does not technically
constitute a counter-claim or give
rise to a set-off: <i>John Shearer Ltd v
Gehl Co</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1789.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1789</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2018%20ACSR%20780" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 18 ACSR 780</a>; <i>Foreman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/1366.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 1366</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=25%20ACSR%20675" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">25 ACSR 675.</a>
<P>

13	In my opinion the Court's task in deciding under s 459H(1)(b) whether it is
satisfied that the company has an offsetting claim
is similar to its task in
deciding whether it is satisfied under s 459H(1)(a) that there is a genuine
dispute as to the existence
or amount of the debt.  Although the question posed
by s 459H(1)(b) is whether the company <b>has</b> an offsetting claim, a claim
falls within the definition of "offsetting claim" as long as it is a <b>claim
</b>which is a<b> genuine</b> claim.  Once the claim is judged to be genuine,
it qualifies for the purpose of the calculation made under s 459H.  
<P>

14	Many formulations of the standard to which the Court must be satisfied that
a "genuine" dispute exists have been given in the
cases.  The defendant
referred to <i>Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G &amp; M Aldridge Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/681.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 681</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20ACSR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 ACSR 353</a> at 365, where the Full Federal Court said that a genuine
dispute requires that the dispute be bona fide and truly exist in fact;
and
that the grounds for alleging the existence of the dispute are real and not
spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived.
 An oft-cited observation of
McLelland CJ in EQ is also helpful.  In <i>Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACSR%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACSR 785</a> at 787, he said that the expression "genuine dispute",
"connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much
the
same sort of considerations as the 'serious question to be tried' criterion
which arises with an obligation for an interlocutory
injunction before the
extension or removal of a caveat".  As Young J said in <i>John Holland
Construction &amp; Engineering Pty Ltd v Kilpatrick Green Pty Ltd</i> (1994) 14
ACSR 250, there must be something "between mere assertion and the proof that
would be necessary in a court of law".
<P>

15	I have found it appropriate to emphasise these tests because much of the
hearing was occupied by matters which appeared to me
to go beyond the "genuine
claim" criterion, and into the realm of full proof of the claims and
counter-claims of the parties.  All
that the Court is required to do and all it
can do in proceedings such as the present is to make a determination as to
whether there
is a genuine offsetting claim.  
<P>

16	Although the Court must be careful not to allow the proceedings to become a
hearing on the validity of the claim in which questions
of credit of witnesses
become matters for determination, I decided in the present case that it was
appropriate to allow limited cross-examination
of Mr Lake.  This was because
his evidence about the debts and their assignment was crucial and in
documentary form it was potentially
ambiguous.
<P>

17	Mr Lake's evidence in his affidavits and orally is that as a result of other
demands for payment made in 1998, the directors
of APH carried out a detailed
review of all previous inter-company debts and consequently made journal
entries in the plaintiff's
loan account with the defendant reflecting the true
updated position.  Annexure E to his affidavit of 26 November 1998 is a summary
of journal entries for that loan account which shows the debt of $423,129 owing
as at 30 June 1998 and then shows subsequent adjustments.
 As I have mentioned
earlier, Mr Lake's final evidence is that some of those adjustments produce a
figure of $409,232.80 as the amount
truly owing.  The other adjustments in
annexure E to Mr Lake's first affidavit relate to alleged assignments.
<P>

18	At the time it was prepared, annexure E produced a calculation of $180,456
as the balance which was acknowledged to be owing.
 It is significant for the
Court's assessment of the genuineness of the cross-claim that the plaintiff
wrote to the defendant on
3 August 1998 stating that according to its records,
that amount was payable by the plaintiff to the defendant as at 30 June 1998.
The defendant did not reply to this letter but served its demand on about 26
October 1998 knowing that the plaintiff had calculated
that a much smaller
amount was due than the amount which was demanded.  The figure asserted at that
time by the plaintiff, namely
$180,456, appears as an unsecured loan in the
plaintiff's audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 1998.
<P>

19	As I have mentioned, there are three items in annexure E to the first
affidavit which are claimed to be the subject of assignments.
 The first is an
entry of $10,000 described as "offset moneys owing to Bruce Craig Pty Ltd".
The plaintiff's evidence is that by
letter of 30 June 1998 Bruce Craig
Australia Pty Ltd purported to assign its right to money owed to it by the
defendant totalling
$10,000 to the plaintiff in consideration of 287,500 fully
paid shares issued to it by APH at NZ 4 cents per share.  The defendant
submits
that this alleged transaction is fictitious or contrary to the evidence because
the consideration had been supplied by APH
rather than the assignee.  But the
plaintiff says, plausibly enough to satisfy the "genuine claim" test, that the
transaction occurred
in two stages which have been elided in the commercial
document which evidences it.  First Bruce Craig Australia Pty Ltd assigned
its
debt to APH in consideration of the APH shares; then APH assigned the same debt
to the plaintiff.  There is evidence of the latter
transaction in a minute of a
meeting of directors of the plaintiff held on 30 June 1998.  The assignment
from Bruce Craig to the
ultimate assignee, the plaintiff, was notified to the
defendant by notice dated 12 February 1999.
<P>

20	As to the sum of $74,475 described as "offset moneys owed to Numarra", there
is evidence in the latter company's audited financial
statements for the year
ended 30 June 1996 that its then chief entity, the defendant, owed $41,530 at
that time.  The audited financial
statements for the following year show that
this debt had increased to $58,375.  The plaintiff says that this amount was
increasing
by virtue of an arrangement (reflected in a letter from Hennessy
Brigden to Numarra dated 28 May 1998) that Numarra would pay the
defendant's
audit fees.  A minute of a meeting of directors of Numarra held on 30 June 1998
notes that the company is presently owed
$74,475 by the defendant.  The
directors then resolved to assign the debt to the plaintiff.
<P>

21	As to the sum of $29,950 described as "offset moneys owed to Numarra for
Hennessy Brigden debt", the plaintiff's evidence is
that by the letter of 28
May 1998 Hennessy Brigden wrote to the directors of Numarra claiming that
amount with respect to audit fees
for the defendant.  The letter stated that
the debt with respect to the defendant was being paid by Numarra out of unit
sales in
accordance with an irrevocable letter of authority, and the letter
made a demand because the payment arrangements were not at that
stage fully
complied with.  The plaintiff says that by 30 June 1998 this arrangement with
respect to payment of fees led to the debt
of $74,475 referred to above.  As at
30 June 1998 there remained a debt of $29,950 which was the subject of Hennessy
Brigden's letter
of demand.  The debt was discharged out of settlement proceeds
owing to Numarra.  The plaintiff says that this created an inter-company
debt
of $29,950 owing by the defendant to Numarra.  Numarra assigned the debt by
resolution of its directors on 30 June 1998.
<P>

22	A notice to the defendant of Numarra's assignment of these two debts
totalling $104,425 to the plaintiff, dated 12 February 1999,
is in evidence.
<P>

23	The three offsetting claims just mentioned total $114,425.  The plaintiff
seeks to offset a further claim arising out of another
assignment.  This time
the debt is for $103,934 which is said to have been owing by the defendant to
Lopmand Pty Ltd, Mr Lake's family
company.  The plaintiff's evidence for the
existence of this debt is principally in some working papers of Hennessy
Brigden dated
30 June 1996.  The directors of Lopmand purported to assign the
debt at their meeting on 29 January 1999 and the directors of the
plaintiff
purported to accept the assignment on the same day.
<P>

24	Mr Lake's evidence is that notices of the assignments of the Lopmand,
Numarra and Craig debts were served on Mr Lindsay-Owen
on 14 February 1999 and
on the defendant by mail subsequently.
<P>

25	As regards these debts and the assignment of them, the defendant contends
that if one reviews the accounts of the defendant and
its group, including the
accounts of Numarra and the plaintiff, it becomes evident that the accounting
entries which purport to acknowledge
the debts and then the assignments of
those debts cannot be correct.  He submits that Mr Lake, having prepared and
filed an affidavit
in November 1998, had (as the defendant's legal
representative says) "a brainwave" that further assignments would enable the
plaintiff
to resist the statutory demand.  Some of the debts were in fact
written off, and the defendant says that where a debt has been written
off the
Court should conclude that there is subsequently no genuine debt which could be
the subject of an assignment.
<P>

26	My difficulty with these submissions is that they tend to go to the question
of the actual existence of the debts and the actual
efficacy of the
assignments, rather than to the question whether there is a genuine offsetting
claim in respect of each of the assigned
debts.  The documentary evidence does
not demonstrate that Mr Lake's account is incorrect.  So far as the writing off
of debts is
concerned, I merely observe that the step of writing off debts in a
company's financial statements is an accounting operation which
does not serve
to extinguish the debt.  A debt remains in existence (absent payment or
set-off) unless the creditor waives its rights
or the debt becomes statute
barred.  The debts in this case do not appear to be statute barred and there is
no evidence of waiver
other than the simple evidence of the writing off of the
debts.
<P>

27	My opinion is that the evidence against the existence of the debts and the
assignments of them is not strong enough to enable
me to conclude that there is
no genuine offsetting claim arising out of the alleged transactions.  On the
contrary, the evidence
on the whole and in particular the plaintiff's evidence
referred to above, suggests that there is some ground for the offsetting
claims
which the plaintiff asserts.  The law is such that in those circumstances I
must conclude that there is an offsetting claim
for the total amount of the
assigned debts.
<P>

28	In the result the statutory demand was for an amount which exceeds the
proper amount which may be the subject of the demand because
of the existence
of the offsetting claims.  The proper course for me to take now is to make an
order varying the statutory demand
under s 459G(4).  In the present
circumstances there is no occasion for making any order extending the time for
the plaintiff to
meet the varied demand because the balance which is properly
the subject of the demand has been paid.  
<P>

29	I made an order with respect to the costs of the hearing on 15 February 1999
(when I adjourned the case for further hearing on
26 February 1999) in favour
of the defendant.  What I now propose to do does not affect that order.  My
intention is I will not make
any order with respect to costs of the hearing on
26 February 1999.  I reach this conclusion as a balancing exercise having
regard
to what has been put to me on the question of costs.  Although the
plaintiff has substantially succeeded at the hearing, that success
was
dependent upon notices of assignments of debts which were served no earlier
than 14 February 1999, the day before the case first
came before me.
Additionally, of the amount the subject of the statutory demand, some $190,000
was acknowledged to be owing and was
paid on 25 February 1999, the day before
the second hearing of the matter.  I also take into account that Mr Lake's
first affidavit
of 16 November 1998 put the matter rather differently from
subsequent affidavits.  In particular the claim to the assignment of the
Lopmand debt was only raised in the affidavit of 12 February 1999, and there
was a substantial contest on 15 February 1999 as to
whether the affidavit
should be permitted to be filed and read.  The full particularisation of the
plaintiff's position arose only
in the affidavit of 22 February 1999, a week
after the date set down for hearing of the case.
<P>

30	It is true that the plaintiff informed the defendant on 3 August 1998 that
it believed that the amount owing was much less than
the amount claimed in the
statutory demand, but this letter was in the form of an unparticularised
assertion which made no reference
to anything like the ultimate basis of the
claim which was put by the plaintiff in the proceedings.  
<P>

31	In those circumstances the defendant had no clear idea of the case it was
required to meet until the day of the adjourned hearing
on 26 February 1999.
It seems to me, taking those matters into account and balancing against them
the plaintiff's eventual success,
that the appropriate course is that each
party should pay its own costs except with respect to the hearing on 15
February 1999, as
to which I have already ordered the plaintiff pay the
defendant's costs.  
<P>

32	My orders are these:  
<P>

	1.	Under s 459H(4) I order that the statutory demand dated 10 October 1998 be
varied by substituting for the amount of $423,129
there claimed, the amount of
$190,873.80.
<P>

	2.	The summons is otherwise dismissed.
<P>

	3.	Having made an order that the defendant's costs of the hearing on 15
February 1999 be paid by the plaintiff, I make no further
order as to costs.
<P>
