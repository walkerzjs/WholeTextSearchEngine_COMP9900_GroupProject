<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:   </b>On Monday 8 February 1999 the plaintiff asked me ex
parte to restrain  proposed action by a mortgagee to advertise property for
sale
in a way which could detrimentally affect the price that might otherwise
be obtained.   The gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint
was that disclosure of
an asking price or the fact that the sale was a mortgagee sale might prejudice
a sale by private treaty that
the mortgagor hoped shortly to close.  I declined
to give that relief ex parte, but in view of the fact that the advertisement,
if
it was to be restrained, had to be restrained by 2 o'clock on Tuesday, 9
February, put the matter in the list for 9 February at 9.50am.
<P>

2	On that day the question as to the extent to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act 1919</a> applied was fully argued.  During the argument, which finished about
noon, the defendant mortgagee agreed to amend the advertisement
by taking out
reference to price, and that disposed of a lot of the urgency of the case.  The
advertisement was, in effect, printed
this morning in its amended form.
<P>

3	Embarrassingly to all of us, at 2 o'clock on 9 February when I was about to
give reasons for judgment, Mr Thomson of counsel,
who appeared for the
defendant, pointed out that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> did not apply to Torrens system land, and
that this current land was all under the Torrens system.  The matter was then
adjourned
to today to consider whether there was a course available under the
general rules of Equity to give some relief to the plaintiff,
and if so whether
such relief should be given.
<P>

4	On Tuesday Mr McAlary QC and Miss Kaur-Bains appeared for the plaintiff and
took me through the cases that show the width of the
jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
103(2)</a>, including my own decision in<b> Manton v Parabolic Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2
NSWLR 361</a> at 379-381;<b> Palk v Mortgage Services Funding Plc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20Ch%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] Ch 330</a>
and<b> Cheltenham and Gloucester Plc v Krausz</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/780.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] EWCA Civ 780</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201558" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1558.</a>
<P>

5	That line of authority shows that when the section applies the court has a
very wide jurisdiction and that where appropriate it
will order a judicial sale
of the property and it will usually commit that sale to the mortgagor.
<P>

6	However, there is flavour in the cases, especially in the<b> Cheltenham</b>
<b>case</b>, and in a decision of Kekewich, J in <b>Brewer v Square</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%202%20Ch%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892]
2 Ch 111</a>, 115, that where the mortgagee is actively pursuing its statutory or
contractual power of sale then the court usually does not exercise
its
discretion to order judicial sale.  However, the matter, generally speaking, is
in the wide discretion of the court.
<P>

7	I was expecting today that there would be an argument that there is a general
equitable jurisdiction analogous to that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> with respect to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a> land. That submission was formally made, but it was not really
backed up with very much material.
<P>

8	The main thrust of the argument today was that the mortgagee had breached its
duty to act bona fide in and about the exercise
of its statutory power of sale
and, accordingly, it should be restrained.
<P>

9	That argument has tremendous difficulties.  The first difficulty is that
ordinarily the court requires a mortgagor, where it is
challenging the exercise
of a power of sale, to pay the money due under the mortgage into court; see for
instance<b> Harvey v McWatters</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1948/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1948] NSWStRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2049%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 49 SR (NSW) 173</a> and<b> Inglis v
Commonwealth Bank</b> (1972) 126 CLR 161.  There are exceptions, such as an
application under s 103(2), and there have been articles written by both Bryson
J in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20Australian%20Bar%20Review%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 Aust Bar Rev 1</a>  and by myself  in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%201%20Australian%20Property%20Law%20Journal%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 1 APLJ 61</a> pointing out
that the rule is just the ordinary rule and not an invariable rule.  However,
even with that modification, some reason
has got to be shown why the ordinary
rule should not apply and that is not here in the present case.
<P>

10	Secondly, it is the accepted law these days that the mortgagee has a fairly
wide right to market the property as it considers
best in its own interest.  It
is often said that a mortgagee is not a trustee of a power of sale.  These
statements probably overstate
the law, and as Walsh J pointed out in<b> Forsyth
v Blundell</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%20477" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 477</a>, 493 when one reads past the general words
and analyses the judgments it cannot be seen that they all speak with the one
voice.
<P>

11	The allegation made against the mortgagee is essentially that the mortgagee
is a second mortgagee which is owed $1.8 million
and the first mortgagee is
owed $88,000.  Apart from the costs of sale and any necessary legal costs which
could be tacked on to
the mortgage $1.888 million will clear the mortgagor's
debts.
<P>

12	There was an aborted auction sale last year, at which considerably less than
this sum was offered.  The mortgagee is pursuing
an advertising campaign which
can be seen to only be seeking a sum of this figure, or a little less.  On the
other hand, the mortgagor
has a bona fide offer in excess of this sum and is
reasonably hopeful of getting even more offered after negotiations, so long as
those negotiations are not kiboshed by the bidder becoming aware that it can
deal with the mortgagee much more cheaply.
<P>

13	The general line of authority under the mortgagee's duty cases would tend to
suggest that unless there is a great discrepancy
between the amount the
mortgagee is seeking to obtain and the true value of the property, so that that
great disparity in itself
suggests fraud, and provided that the mortgagee is
pursuing a course of obtaining a fair price by acting on the advice of valuers
and professional real estate marketers, the court does not interfere.
<P>

14	Accordingly, it is very difficult for the court to grant any injunction on
the argument that the mortgagee is not bona fide carrying
out its duty.
<P>

15	I realise as an interlocutory case I have just to find that it is a
sufficiently arguable case, but it is very difficult even
to get to that stage,
even if I can do so without a payment into court.
<P>

16	Although it is rather unsatisfactory, I think I have to deal with the wider
argument because it seems to me that it  may well
be valid, but that even if it
were valid the present case is not a case where the court in its discretion
should order that there
should be a judicial sale.
<P>

17	In the late 16th century and in the 17th century Lords Nottingham and
Hardwicke, two of the fathers of Equity, by their decisions
showed that Equity
would regard a mortgage as merely being security for a debt, and that even
though the mortgagee might have legal
title, and for all intents and purposes
the property would appear to be the absolute property of the mortgagee, the
mortgagee would
be confined in its activities and restrained from doing
anything that would not recognise that its property was merely security for
its
debt.  Accordingly, if its debt could be satisfied by other methods the
mortgagee may be restrained from exercising its powers
if that would prejudice
the mortgagor.
<P>

18	By the turn of the 19th century, it was clear that where the mortgaged
property was in the name of an infant there could never
be a decree for
foreclosure because the infant could never make admissions so as to get a
decree, and any defence put on by a guardian
ad litem could be set aside after
the infant came of age.  Accordingly, it was the practice, where an infant was
involved in a suit
for foreclosure, to order sale.
<P>

19	The English cases were reviewed by Chancellor Kent in<b> Mills v Dennis</b>
(1818) 3 Johnson's Chancery 367 (NY).  At 368-369 Chancellor Kent said that he
could see no reason why there was not jurisdiction
to order judicial sale in a
foreclosure case in the situation of an adult because the jurisdiction was no
different to that of an
infant.  The flavour that comes through the judgment is
that Equity has jurisdiction to order judicial sale in a mortgage case when
it
is generally more beneficial to both parties.
<P>

20	In the first half of the 19th century, for the reasons that I set out in<b>
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Comer</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%205%20BPR%2011%2c748" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 5 BPR 11,748</a>,
there was a great amount of delay in foreclosure suits in the Court of
Chancery.  This at the time led money lenders to insert a
contractual power of
sale into the mortgage.  The Equity Court thought that that was not the
gentlemanly thing to do and said so
on many occasions in the first half of the
19th century, but, by 1850, the legislature had recognised powers of sale and,
indeed,
given them statutory authority.
<P>

21	We also find at the same time that statute reformed Chancery procedure to
make foreclosure suits able to be speedily heard and
at the same time the
predecessor of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> was inserted into the statute
governing the Equity side of this Court and the Chancery Court in England.
<P>

22	As I explained in<b> Manton v Parabolic </b>(supra), s 12 of the Equity Act
1901 and its predecessor, which in due course became <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act</a>, were part of the Equity procedure in foreclosure suits.  Because
foreclosure under the Torrens system is dealt with administratively
after an
aborted sale by auction the matter never comes before the Court of Equity and
so <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> and its predecessor did not apply to purely Torrens system land.
<P>

23	However, this did not affect the power that there was in the court to order
judicial sale in an appropriate case.  It is merely
an illustration that in
some situations the statute  had set out a power that was previously part of
the general law.  There were
arguments against that because it would seem that
by 1850 courts had ceased making orders for sale in foreclosure suits and the
full
reason for that is not quite clear.  Cases such as <b>Jenkins v Jones
</b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1860/486.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1860] EngR 486</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281860%29%202%20Giff%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1860) 2 Giff 99</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=66%20ER%2043" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">66 ER 43</a> show, however, the same spirit as earlier
cases.
<P>

24	Mr Thomson for the defendant said that judicial sale is really just a
species of specific performance, or alternatively is part
of the remedial
package used under Torrens constructive trusts, et cetera.  With respect, the
cases show that it goes further.  Story
on<b> Equity Jurisprudence</b> 13th ed
(1887, Boston, Little Brown &amp; Co) p 559 shows some of the width, and if one
goes to cases, such as<b> Curtis v Curtis</b> (1789) 2 Brown's Chancery Cases
620, 633; <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1789/471.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1789] EngR 471</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=29%20ER%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">29 ER 342</a>, 349, one can see that the practice even 200 years ago was
to give judicial sale, whenever it was appropriate.
<P>

25	Arden, MR said:
<P>

 "The law gives the creditor only the land to hold, until he is satisfied.
Equity goes further, and says, if the remedy at law is
not sufficient, we will
sell the inheritance in the estate, and if that will not do, we will direct an
account of rents and profits
against the heir."
<P>

26	Accordingly, the decree was made in a widow's suit for the dower where the
heir at law had been, he thought, particularly clever
in moving the property
out of the widow's reach.
<P>

27	It would seem that the remedy of judicial sale in a mortgage case is one
that is only applied almost as a last resort.  It is
applied in America more
often than it is in Australia.  One of the reasons for that is explained in
Nelson Whitman<b> Real Estate Finance Law</b> 2nd ed (1985, St Paul, West
Publishing Co) at pp 530 and following, that the statutory powers of sale in
some US States are unconstitutional
as they are a deprivation of property other
than on just terms and, accordingly, it is necessary to apply more often to the
courts
for judicial sale which is constitutionally unassailable.
<P>

28	The powers of judicial sale have been used in America to make sure that in
periods of depression properties are not sold for
a few dollars when waiting
may well produce the full amount, and in the appropriate case the court will
put in a receiver to run
the land at profit for a period and only after that
period permit the property to be sold.  The reason for this approach is that
the court recognises that the mortgage is a mere security for a debt and that
the mortgagee is entitled to its money, but it is only
the master of the legal
estate in the property up to a point, and when that point is reached Equity
will interfere by judicial sale,
if necessary, or by some other method.
Illustrations are<b> Potter Matlock Trust Co v Warren County</b> 207 SW 709
(Kentucky) (1919) and<b> Suring State Bank v Giese</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=246%20NW%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">246 NW 556 (Wisconsin)</a>
(1933).
<P>

29	It would seem to me that the extraordinary judicial power to order sale in
Equity would apply by an analogy to certain cases
that would be dealt with
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> for Old System land.  <b> Palk's case</b> (supra) would be one,
though it may be that Mr Thomson is correct in submitting the<b> Palk</b>
situation could be dealt with under Equity's jurisdiction to protect
sureties.
<P>

30	Accordingly, in my view, the probability is that there is an equitable power
to award judicial sale at the suit of a mortgagor
where the circumstances show
that there is clear  prejudice from the application of the ordinary methods of
foreclosure or sale under
a power of sale.
<P>

31	However, the law that has developed and has been recognised in decisions in
the High Court, such as<b> Pendlebury v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1912] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%2013%20CLR%20676" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 13 CLR 676</a>, do set up the ordinary regime, and that is that the
mortgagee is given considerable liberty to sell as it thinks appropriate and
it
is only when a certain point is reached that the court considers it appropriate
to interfere with that liberty.
<P>

32	However, having said that, I should stress again what I said earlier that
there are a whole lot of catcalls about mortgagees
not being trustees of the
powers of sale which are apt to mislead unless one looks very closely at what
the courts really mean by
a detailed consideration of the authorities.
<P>

33	The courts still consider that a power of sale is a power and there must not
be a fraud on the power, and if there is a fraud
on the power Equity will
intervene.  This is quite apparent when one looks at<b> Barns v Queensland
National Bank Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%20925" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3 CLR 925</a>, which is really the first of the High
Court decisions following cases like<b> Kennedy v De Trafford</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] AC 180</a>
because at p 943 in<b> Barns</b> the High Court expressly referred to the
principles of fraud on a power as set out by Lord Westbury in<b> Portland
(Duke) v Topham </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1864/339.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1864] EngR 339</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281864%29%2011%20HLCas%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1864) 11 HLC 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11%20ER%201242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">11 ER 1242.</a>
<P>

34	More guidance as to the exact way in which courts approach the mortgagee's
duties not to commit a fraud on the power are set
out in judgments such as that
of Kekewich, J in <b>Colson v Williams</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2061%20LT%2071" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 61 LT 71</a> (referred to with
approval by Fox J in<b> Blundell v Associated Securities Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%2019%20FLR%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 19 FLR
17</a>, 30-31), and the decision of the Supreme Court of Ireland in<b> Holohan v
Friends Provident and Century Life Office </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20IR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] IR 1.</a>
<P>

35	However, the view that I have formed, that the jurisdiction probably exists,
is not sufficient to get the plaintiff home.  The
plaintiff needs also to show
that in this particular case the court in its discretion should apply the
principle in aid of the plaintiff.
<P>

36	Because I am firmly of the view that the court should not exercise its
discretion, I have been perhaps a little more free in
coming to the view that
the principle exists. It is a little dangerous to do that because Miss
Kaur-Bains for the plaintiff today
did not precisely formulate that argument
and, accordingly, Mr Thomson was in no position to answer it, and it is always
dangerous
for judges to form their own views without argument of counsel.
<P>

37	Assuming that the jurisdiction exists, it is one to be exercised in the
special case.  It is not to go against the normal procedures
of permitting the
mortgagee under its statutory or contractual power wide liberty to conduct the
sale and, indeed, on analogy with
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, it would seem
to me that where the mortgagee's sale is actively proceeding the equitable
power should not ordinarily be exercised.
<P>

38	However, over and above all those matters, in the present case is the
consideration that there have been two previous proceedings
between these
parties.  The first in 50187/97, which ended in a consent decree for the $1.8
million and a consent setting up of a
regime for possession.     Then there was
suit 4403/98 commenced by the mortgagor in October last year for orders,
including orders
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 103.</a>
<P>

39	The second suit was settled by consent orders that the suit be discontinued
and that there would be an undertaking to the court
that, inter alia, the
present plaintiff would not in any way prevent, obstruct or seek to prevent the
defendant exercising its power
of sale, and further that the parties agreed
that the mortgagor could effect the sale at any stage up to 5pm on 11 November
1998,
and thereafter the mortgagee would conduct the sale.
<P>

40	There has been some argument presented that an undertaking to the court not
to prevent a mortgagee sale does not prevent an application
being made to the
court such as the present.  I do not wish to deal with that argument, but I
will assume its correctness for the
moment.
<P>

41	However, even if it is correct, the court will not ordinarily grant any
relief to a party who has contracted not to apply for
that relief, a fortiori
when there are additional provisions setting up a regime for sale which
conditions were for the consideration
of settling the suit.
<P>

42	Miss Kaur-Bains merely says that circumstances have changed, but with great
respect that is no answer to the fact that the parties
addressed this matter
last November and settled their differences on the regime that was set up and
that gives the mortgagee at present
the power to sell and to go ahead and
market in the way it thinks fit.
<P>

43	I should note that this morning Miss Kaur-Bains asked for a further
adjournment so that she could consider the matter further.
 That was opposed by
the defendant on the basis that relatively speedy action was required and that
it should not be prejudiced by
being brought back to the court time and time
again because the plaintiff's counsel had not thought out her position.
Although the
argument that the court had jurisdiction had not been presented
thoroughly,  I was prepared to assume its correctness.  However,
even on this
basis I would still decline to give relief in my discretion,  so there was no
point in granting any further adjournment.
<P>

44	 Accordingly, the proceedings should be dismissed with costs.
<P>

                                        oOo
