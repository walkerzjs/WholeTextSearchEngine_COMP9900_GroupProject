<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>These proceedings arise out of dealings between the
parties related to an agreement in writing of 24 March 1995 between the First
Defendant, Mrs Vogler, and the Third Plaintiff, Welcome Waggon of Australia
(NSW) Pty Limited. The agreement provided for the sale
at the purchase price of
$90,000 of the rights to operate a business, together with the business system
and logos, in New South Wales;
the recitals to the agreement identify the
business as<i> "a Public Relations Advertising and Marketing Business providing
a greeting service for new residents with particular emphasis on
business
houses and retailers known as Welcome Waggon of Australia and Australian
Greeting Service using a specific formula (`the
Business System')."</i>
<P>

2	Mrs Vogler, referred to in the agreement as the proprietor, conducted as sole
principal a business so described in Queensland,
and had conducted it since
1985 after purchasing the business from other proprietors.
<P>

3	The Third Plaintiff's name was not inserted in the agreement at the place
appropriate for the name of the purchaser, which was
left blank, but the
agreement was purportedly executed by the Third Plaintiff under its common
seal, attested by signatures of Mr
&amp; Mrs Ramsey and another person who was
a Justice of Peace.  Internal references and grammar in the agreement support
the obvious
conclusion that the Third Party was the only purchaser, as the
language and grammar show that there was to be one purchaser only
and that it
was to be a company.
<P>

4	Mr &amp; Mrs Ramsey were not parties to the agreement of 24 March 1995. They
were and are directors of the Third Plaintiff, and
although there is very
little information in the evidence about the Third Plaintiff and its affairs it
appears from the correspondence
leading up to the agreement that they obtained
control of the Third Plaintiff within a short time before 24 March 1995
specifically
for the purpose of its making the agreement and operating the
Business System under their control. None of the pre-contractual communications
and representations were directed to the Third Plaintiff and the evidence
showed no basis on which it could be found that the Third
Plaintiff relied on
them. 
<P>

5	The agreement contains provisions in clauses 5 and 12 which would exclude any
collateral condition or warranty; the Third Plaintiff
does not sue on any
contractual warranty; nor do Mr &amp; Mrs Ramsey, who did not enter into any
contractual arrangement with either
Defendant. Clause 5 also states:
<P>

	<i>"The Purchaser, its officers, directors, agents, employees or contractors
have conducted an independent investigation of the business
and recognises that
the business venture contemplated by the Agreement involves business risks and
that its success will be largely
dependant on the ability of the Purchaser as
an independent business operator."</i>
<P>

6	Any contractual effect which this may have can relate only to rights of the
Third Plaintiff and not to rights of Mr or Mrs Ramsey.
<P>

7	The more significant representations relied on were made in January and
February 1995; they were not directed to the Third Plaintiff
and it is very
unlikely that the Third Plaintiff existed at that time; or if it existed, it
had no involvement in the events until
some time in March.
<P>

8	Relevant communications opened with an advertisement published by the Second
Defendant Mr Davies, in the Sydney Morning Herald
on Friday 20 January 1995.
The advertisement stated:
<P>

	<i>"BUSINESS  Opportunity  State Rights.  A well known </i>
<P>

<i>	Queensland Company which has been operating successfully for 28 years
offers a unique opportunity to purchase the sole rights for
New South Wales.
This business operates in the Public Relations/Advertising field and is ideal
for wife/husband</i>
<P>

<i>	NO STOCK REQUIRED</i>
<P>

<i>	NO SELLING REQUIRED</i>
<P>

<i>	HIGH INCOME POTENTIAL</i>
<P>

<i>	For an investment of $120,000 you can secure the State Rights for N.S.W.
You will enjoy the support and services of a proven successful
company and you
would be able to successfully franchise areas within N.S.W.  This business
operated successfully in New Zealand and
other States of Australia.  For
further confidential information please write, fax or phone to The Business
Consultant,</i>
<P>

<i>	P.O.  Box 155, The Gap,</i>
<P>

<i>	Queensland.  4061.</i>
<P>

<i>	Phone or Fax 07 300 6518."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

9	Mr Ramsey responded to the advertisement by telephoning Mr Davies on 20
January 1995. There followed a series of telephone and
written communications
about the business opportunity referred to. Most of these communications passed
between Mr Ramsey and Mr Davies.
On one occasion on or about 25 January 1995
Mrs Vogler and Mr Ramsey spoke on the telephone. In March Messrs Phillips Fox
solicitors
of Sydney communicated with Mr Davies on behalf of Mr Ramsey and Mr
Davies responded himself, except that on one occasion only, on
17 March 1995,
Mr W H Bennett, solicitor of Ashgrove Queensland  wrote to Messrs Phillips Fox
on Mr Davies behalf. Neither Mrs Vogler
nor Mr Davies ever communicated or
intended to communicate with Mrs Ramsey. Except for the one telephone
conversation referred to,
Mrs Vogler did not communicate with Mr Ramsey, and
all significant communications and any relevant representations in them were
made
by Mr Davies to Mr Ramsey.
<P>

10	Mr Davies was acting in all these communications within the general
authority conferred on him by Mrs Vogler in a written agreement
on 19 April
1994, Exhibit G, and the agreement shows that she authorised him to use
information which she furnished to him in marketing.
In any representation he
made to Mr Ramsey, Mr Davies was acting within the general authority so
conferred, and Mrs Vogler is responsible
as his principal for any such
representation, both in tort law and under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a>
(NSW) subs 70 (4).
<P>

11	In the Statement of Claim the Plaintiffs first (in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and
10) allege that they have a cause of action against
Mrs Vogler in that she did
in trade and commerce engage in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or
likely to mislead or deceive.
It is alleged that each of the Plaintiffs has
suffered loss and damage by that conduct; and they rely on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(b)</a>,(e)
and (j) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 50</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW). They give
particulars of the representations by which she is alleged to have engaged in
conduct that was misleading or deceptive
as follows:
<P>

	<i>"6.  (a)  That the First Defendant had rights Australia-wide to </i>
<P>

<i>	the Business System, and that she had intellectual property rights in the
said Business System which were capable of purchase from
her and of
exploitation by the Plaintiffs.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  That the business was operating successfully in New </i>
<P>

<i>	Zealand and Victoria and had been sold in Western Australia."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	"6. (e)  That the business had high income potential.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)  That the business would be able to be successfully </i>
<P>

<i>	francished (sic) and operated in New South Wales.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)  That the annual income of the business would be not less </i>
<P>

<i>	than $84,000.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(h)  That in December of 1994, the business commenced in </i>
<P>

<i>	Victoria had entered into agreements for advertising/sponsorship with three
shopping malls at call rates of $15, $15 and $17 respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)  That the business represented a genuine opportunity to </i>
<P>

<i>	establish a substantial cash flow."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

12	Particulars in paragraphs 6(c) and 6(d) were not pressed. The Plaintiffs
indicated in correspondence in Exhibit A that they would
seek to add further
particulars but made no amendment at the hearing.
<P>

13	The Plaintiffs make claims against Mr Davies in paragraphs 11 and 16 of the
Statement of Claim. These claims are to the effect
that in order to induce the
Plaintiffs to enter into the agreement, the Second Defendant made
representations which were false, and
were fraudulent in that he knew them to
be false or was reckless as to whether they were true or false, that the
Plaintiffs and each
of them signed the agreement of 24 March 1995 in reliance
on the representations and induced by them, and that they have suffered
loss
and damage.
<P>

14	The representations referred to appear in particulars 12(c) and 12(d) in the
Statement of Claim; other particulars were not pressed.
<P>

	<i>"12.  (c)  That in December 1994 in Melbourne, three shopping </i>
<P>

<i>	malls had agreed to commence advertising/sponsoring and the call rates were
$15, $15 and $17 respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)  That the business provided a genuine opportunity to </i>
<P>

<i>	establish a substantial cash flow and at the same time obtain a return for
franchising/selling areas throughout New South Wales."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

15	Then the Plaintiffs allege that after purchase of the business they
conducted the Business System but it failed completely, and
that the amount of
$70,000, which they paid as part of the purchase price, is repayable on a total
failure of consideration. Plaintiffs
allege that they terminated the agreement
on 27 March 1996. They claim remedies which would establish that the agreement
is void
and of no effect, either under the general law or under powers in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a>, judgment for $70,000, damages and other
relief.
<P>

16	The Statement of Claim does not refer to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i>
1987</a> (NSW), on which power to award damages depends.  In a Cross-claim Mrs
Vogler claims the remaining $20,000 of the purchase price.
<P>

17	There is no evidence that any of the representations alleged was directed to
or communicated to Mrs Ramsey, or to the Third Plaintiff.
There is no evidence
that either of them relied on any representation made by Mrs Vogler or Mr
Davies.  It would not have been reasonable
for them to rely on representations
or communications directed to someone else unless in some way their terms or
other material established
that it was intended that they should be passed on
to them and relied on. In my opinion there is no basis in principle upon which
a person engaged in pre-contractual negotiation with an identified recipient
incurs liability in tort or for misleading and deceptive
conduct to some other
person to whom he did not intend to direct a communication who learns of it and
decides to act on it. For this
reason neither Mrs Ramsey nor the Third
Plaintiff can, in my opinion, recover damages or other remedy in tort or under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a>.
<P>

18	In my view it cannot be said that there was a total failure of consideration
for the agreement. The rights which were to pass
according to the terms of the
agreement were actually conferred on the Third Defendant. Mrs Vogler gave the
principals of the Third
Plaintiff training instruction and assistance in the
conduct of the business, they embarked themselves and their company on the
conduct
of the business and gained some revenue, in amounts which they did not
regard as satisfactory but which were not negligible and continued
for about
three years.  In the circumstances it cannot be said that the consideration for
which the Third Plaintiff paid $70,000
and agreed to pay a further instalment
of $20,000 wholly failed, or that the Third Plaintiff is entitled to recover
the sums already
paid and to defeat its contractual obligation to pay the
remaining $20,000 with interest.
<P>

19	As the Third Plaintiff has not shown that it was induced to enter into the
agreement by any fraudulent representation it has
not established that it was
entitled to avoid the agreement on the basis of fraud or (in the language
actually used) to terminate
the agreement. In my opinion the purported
termination of March 1996 did not take effect.
<P>

20	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) does not contain any provisions
dealing with the territorial range of its operation, or expressing an intention
to operate
extraterritorially; relevantly, to operate in respect of misleading
or deceptive conduct engaged in at places outside New South Wales.

<P>

21	The State Legislature has power to make laws with extraterritorial
operation; see <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1986114/" class="autolink_findacts">Australia Act</i> 1986</a> (Cth) subs 2(1) and <i>Port MacDonnell
Professional Fisherman's Association Inc v South Australia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%20340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR
340</a> at 372.  Although the Legislature of the State has and in 1987 had power to
legislate with extraterritorial effect, in my opinion
it should be understood
not to have intended to do so, but rather to have enacted law to regulate and
establish consequences of conduct
engaged in within the State, unless it
appears expressly or by necessary intendment from the terms of its legislation
that extraterritorial
operation was intended. In my opinion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</i> 1987</a> does not alter this approach, subs 31(1) does
not extend the operation which the language of a statute would otherwise have
and does
not mean that all legislation of the State is to be construed as
operating extraterritorially to the full extent to which power to
legislate
extraterritorially exists. When all subsections of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31</a> are taken together it
should be understood that subsections (1) and (3) are ancillary to the
provision relating to severance in subsection
(2), and that the three
subsections are a scheme of provisions which either prevent the interpretation
of statutes from being affected
by their being read down so as to confine them
to legislative power, or restrict the effects of their being read down when
they must
be. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 31(1)</a> cannot have the effect that all State
legislation is to be taken as operating extraterritorially to the full extent
to which power
exists under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1986114/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 2(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1986114/" class="autolink_findacts">Australia Act</i> 1986</a>
(Cth); an intention to legislate such a far-reaching change would be expressed
directly. 
<P>

23	In the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) contraventions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 50</a>
are offences, but contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> is not; see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62</a> (1). The form of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 50</a> in each case is that the section prohibits conduct of stated
kinds; the Legislature commands that the conduct shall not happen. In
so
legislating the State law according to its ordinary and reasonable construction
should be understood as prohibiting conduct within
the territory of the State.
When by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 72</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s73.html" class="autolink_findacts">73</a> it creates remedies for (among other things) breaches of
these prohibitions, it should be understood as creating remedies in respect
of
the conduct which it has earlier prohibited, not in respect of conduct of
similar kinds which occurs outside the territory to
which the prohibition
related. The fact that there is legislation in Queensland dealing with the same
subject in a generally similar
way assists, to some small degree, the
conclusion that the legislation of New South Wales was not intended to operate
in respect
of events in Queensland. The provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s68</a> relating to actions
for damages confer a right of recovery where the conduct by which loss or
damage was suffered is in contravention
of such a prohibition; there is no
indication of an intention to confer a remedy where loss is suffered within New
South Wales and
irrespective of the place of the events which caused the
loss.
<P>

24	There is no analogy with the reasoning relating to "result" offences upon
which the decision in <i>Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 78</a> was based. In that case the Appellant was charged with
offences of polluting waters and causing waters to be polluted; the waters
were
in New South Wales and the causative events occurred in Queensland, and the
offence could be seen as created by reference to
producing the result of
pollution of waters in New South Wales. The structure of the relevant
provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) is quite different and
cannot be seen as attaching the remedy of damages to conduct irrespective of
the place of the conduct;
prohibition is explicitly directed at the conduct
itself and the remedy is ancillary to the prohibition. The situation is quite
unlike
legislation which was interpreted as creating an offence in cases where
the result of pollution of waters occurred within New South
Wales and
irrespective of the location of the causative conduct. It is important
therefore to determine not only whether the conduct
alleged against Mrs Vogler
occurred, but also where it in fact occurred.
<P>

25	The conduct complained of consisted of representations made in the following
communications:-
<P>

	The advertisement of 20 January 1995.
<P>

	
<P>

	The letter from Mr Davies to Mr Ramsey of 21 January 1995 and enclosed
information, principally a statement of three pages headed
Statement of
Information containing three pages and also six documents in the nature of
testimonials.
<P>

	
<P>

	A telephone conversation about 4 pm on 21 January 1995 between Mr Davies and
Mr Ramsey and statements then made by Mr Davies about
the history of the
business, including to these effects:
<P>

	
<P>

	that the business was sold in New Zealand and Victoria several months ago and
the same people who bought New Zealand also bought
Western Australia but they
are setting up New Zealand first before they do Western Australia.
<P>

	
<P>

	that there had not previously been any extension of the operation outside
Queensland.
<P>

	
<P>

	that <i>"The business has been sold in Victoria to a person named Jasmine
Kannapian. It is up and running and they have entered into several
contracts
with major shopping centres in Victoria. Jasmine already has someone interested
in buying a franchised area"</i>.
<P>

	
<P>

26	A letter of 23 January 1995 (but bearing the mistaken date 1994) from Mr
Davies to Mr Ramsey which included a table which appeared
to state, for 29
groups of suburbs and towns in New South Wales, average monthly house sales, a
call rate based on ten advertisers/retailers
at $2.50 per call, monthly income
and the annual income. By way of illustration, this table stated that for
Manly/Warringah there
were 116 average monthly house sales, a call rate of $25,
monthly income of $2,900 and annual income of $34,800. Also enclosed was
a
statement headed General Information with a number of assertions about the
business. There was also a copy of a story published
in a Brisbane suburban
newspaper in 1990.
<P>

27	About 25 January 1995 Mrs Vogler telephoned Mr Ramsey and gave him some
information about a de-registered company which had a
name which had prompted
an enquiry by Mr Ramsey. In this conversation Mr Ramsey said, "<i>.... if I go
ahead and buy the rights from you then I'll have to borrow the money and I have
to make sure that what I am buying is
worthwhile. To get this money, I will
have to take out a loan against my house</i>." Mrs Vogler said, "<i>...... I
assure you that I do have the Australian rights and nothing has been previously
done outside Queensland until we decided
to establish it nationally. You will
be able to profitably franchise and operate it in New South Wales.</i>"
<P>

28	By letter of 31 January 1995 Mr Davies sent Mr Ramsey a draft contract.
<P>

29	On 8 February 1995 Mr Ramsey telephoned Mr Davies and in the conversation Mr
Davies said "<i>......if you started up your own business there, you would be
`passing off' because we own the rights and you are not allowed to do
that. We
would take legal action against you.</i>" On 9 February 1995 Mr Davies sent Mr
Ramsey a letter enclosing "<i>completed cashflow statements and calculation
schedules for your requirements</i>".
<P>

30	Thereafter Mr Ramsey asked Mr Davies to send a copy of the proposed contract
to Mr Ramsey's solicitors, Messrs Phillips Fox of
Sydney, and some
communications followed between them. None of these communications is alleged
to constitute misleading and deceptive
conduct.
<P>

31	It is necessary to make a finding about the place of the conduct <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss42</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">50</a>) and of the making of the representations <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s44)</a>, being conduct of Mrs Vogler
or conduct of Mr Davies which is attributable to her. The conduct under
consideration consists of conversations
by telephone, speaking from Queensland
to Mr Ramsey who was in New South Wales, in the case of Mr Davies dispatching
several articles
by post from Queensland to Mr Davies in New South Wales, and
(in some way which evidence does not deal with) causing the advertisement
to be
published in the Sydney Morning Herald. Although no evidence examines this
matter it is probable that the conduct, whatever
it was, which caused the
advertisement to be published in Sydney took place in Queensland.
<P>

32	I was referred to discussion in the judgment of Mason CJ Deane Dawson and
Gaudron JJ in <i>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited &amp; Anor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
171 CLR 538</a> at 566 to 569 in which their Honours made some observations which
deal with the place of making a statement which is communicated
by letter,
telephone or telex. The context in which their Honours spoke was distant from
the present, as their Honours considered
whether proceedings in an action for
damages for tort consisting of negligent statements or omission to advise
should be stayed on
the ground that New South Wales was clearly an
inappropriate forum, and this led to consideration of whether the cause of
action
sued on was a foreign tort, that is, a Missouri tort. In their Honours'
view the complaint was one of negligent omission (see 568
(foot)), consisting
it would seem of an omission by the Defendants in Missouri to draw the
attention of the Plaintiffs in New South
Wales to some requirements of the
United States revenue law, where there had been some communications between
those places. Ascertaining
the place of the tort required consideration of the
manner in which damage was caused and where damage occurred as damage was an
element of the tort. The present facts do not present quite the same difficulty
because the manner in which damage was caused and
the place at which damage
occurred are not elements in ascertaining, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a>, where a defendant engaged
in conduct, or in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s50</a> the same question, or in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s44</a> where a defendant made a
representation. In <i>Voth</i> their Honours applied the test taken from the
judgment of Lord Pearson in <i>Distillers Co v Thompson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 458</a> at
468 -- "<i>The right approach is ...to look back over the series of events
...and ask ...where in substance did this cause of action arise?</i>" and said
that it is clear that "<i>...it is some act of the defendant, and not its
consequences, that must be the focus of attention.</i>" (page 567). Their
Honours referred (567-568) to treatment in some earlier decisions and judicial
observations about the place of
commission of the tort of negligent
misstatement where the statement is effected by telephone or telex and said
(568), 
<P>

	<i>"If a statement is directed from one place to another place where it is
known or even anticipated that it will be received by the
plaintiff, there is
no difficulty in saying that the statement was, in substance, made at the place
to which it was directed, whether
or not it is there acted upon. And the same
would seem to be true if the statement is directed to a place from where it
ought reasonably
to be expected that it will be brought to the attention of the
plaintiff, even if it is brought to attention at some third place.
But in every
case the place to be assigned to a statement initiated in one place and
received in another is a matter to be determined
by reference to the events and
by asking, as laid down in <b>Distillers</b>, where, in substance, the act took
place."</i>
<P>

33	It is I think clear that their Honours were not speaking to establish any
legal principle about the place at which a representation
is made when it is
made by telephone or other electronic communication. Their Honours'
observations were directed to the tort of
negligent misrepresentation and the
locus of a tort under private international law and have no close bearing on
the application
of the facts in this case to the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</a>. </i> Notwithstanding the observations relating to the location at
which a statement is made when directed from one place to another place,
their
Honours were of clear and strong views that in the application of the
<i>Distillers</i> test the tort was committed in Missouri; see page 569.
<P>

34	Although it cannot be said that authority so requires, I am of the view that
the <i>Distillers</i> test should be applied here because it expresses in a
simple way the task before the Court in applying legislation to the events.
It
must be reframed to ask where in substance the conduct was engaged in or the
representation was made. The newspaper advertisement
directed enquiries to be
made to Mr Davies in Queensland. Mr Ramsey in New South Wales responded by
telephone, and communications
continued. Whenever Mr Ramsey spoke or listened
on the telephone he did so in New South Wales; whenever Mr Davies or Mrs Vogler
spoke
or listened on the telephone, or wrote out a letter and sent it off by
post, they did so in Queensland. Everything relevant which
they did they did in
Queensland, and this is no less so because they used postal or electronic means
which ensured that someone in
New South Wales received their communications. If
attention is maintained on their conduct and their representations it should be
concluded that the location of the conduct and representations was in
Queensland. It is only by introducing Mr Ramsey and his behaviour
in receiving
the communications into consideration that any other conclusion could seem
possible; and his behaviour is not part of
their conduct or representation.
<P>

35	In my finding Mrs Vogler did not engage in any conduct or make any
representation to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss42</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">44</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">50</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a>
applies, either herself or by any conduct of Mr Davies which should be
attributed to her. Nor did Mr Davies. The cause of action
alleged against Mrs
Vogler has not been proved and I should give judgment for her against each
Plaintiff.
<P>

36	The representation alleged in particular 12(c) against Mr Davies was made in
the three pages of information enclosed with his
letter to Mr Ramsey of 21
January 1995. On its third page under the heading "Cost and Income" there is a
statement to the effect
that "<i>...... Shopping Malls ...... pay between
$15-25 per call</i>" and another statement, "<i>in Melbourne last month three
Shopping Malls agreed to commence advertising/sponsoring and the call rates
were $15, $15 and $17 respectively.</i>" Mrs Jasmine Kannapian purchased the
Victorian rights to the Welcome Waggon Business System from Mrs Vogler in or
about August 1994,
she was operating the business in December 1994 and any
statement about the number of shopping malls in Melbourne which agreed to
commence advertising and sponsoring in Melbourne and the call rates could only
be based on information obtained from or attributed
to her; to do otherwise
would be reckless. Her evidence including cross-examination established that at
some time about December
1994 (or possibly earlier) she made an agreement with
the Westfield Shopping Centre at Airport West to provide services at a call
rate which as provided for in the contract was $15, although she says she was
actually paid $17 and that this continued for about
two years. At some time
which was not established she made an agreement with Fountaingate Westfield
Shoppingtown but a lot of time
passed preparing promotional material and the
shopping centre had a change of heart and was not interested to go ahead, so
the agreement
was not actually activated, and she did not ever receive any
payment. There was a verbal agreement for her to be paid $17 per call,
although
that did not actually happen. She said that there were negotiations in which
Mrs Vogler was involved with Eastlands Shopping
Centre, whose representative
Julie Edington said that they were interested, but they never actually put
anything down on paper.
<P>

37	On this evidence there was basis in fact for a representation that one
shopping mall namely Westfield Shopping Centre at Airport
West had agreed by
December 1994 to commence advertising and sponsoring at a call rate of $17 but
there was no basis for saying that
more than one had done so as Fountaingate
Westfield had signed an agreement but had not agreed to commence advertising
and sponsoring
(and no commencement date ever arrived) while Eastlands Shopping
Centre had done no more than express interest. Mr Davies in his
evidence in
chief did not explain the source on which he had made this statement. When
cross-examined (t 108) he said to the effect
that he knew Jasmine Kannapian had
entered into a contract with Airport West, and also to the effect that he had
said that three
shopping centres had agreed to commence, not that they had
commenced. He further said, "<i>Mrs Vogler was aware that Mrs Kannapian was
negotiating with three shopping centres</i>" which in the context I take to be
his explanation of the source of the information on which he made the
statement; that he got the
information from Mrs Vogler, and that the
information related to negotiations, which was not to say that it related to
agreements.
Mrs Vogler was in a good position to have information as in the
second half of 1994 she had sold Mrs Kannapian first a contract relating
to the
Business System in Melbourne, then a contract relating to the Business System
in Victoria, and had given Mrs Kannapian training
and assisted her in
attempting to establish the business. The following passage appears (at t 109
at line 26 to 40):
<P>

	<i>"A.   I have never said that there were contracts entered into by Mrs
Kanniapan.  I have said that she had agreement from those shopping
complexes to
enter into agreements.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.   I want to suggest to you that as at January 1995, you knew that Mrs
Kanniapan had not entered into any contract herself with
any shopping centre in
Victoria?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.   I state again that she had agreement to enter into those contracts.
Whether she had or hadn't I've never said that she had,
I said she had
agreement to enter those contracts.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.   I further put to you that you knew that at no stage during her
proprietary, the proprietorship of the Welcome Waggon business
in Victoria did
she have more than one agreement producing income with any shopping
centre?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I don't know.  I wasn't privy to that."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

38	In my finding it appears from Mr Davies' own evidence that the statement
"<i>in Melbourne last month three shopping malls agreed to commence
advertising/sponsoring and the call rates were $15, $15 and $17
respectively</i>" was false to his actual knowledge. Attributing the events to
"<i>last month</i>" that is to December 1994 was not of much significance but
had some significance for its suggestion of immediacy and progress associated
with obtaining three shopping malls in a month, and gave some false colour to
the statement. It is quite clear from his own evidence
that he knew that it was
not true that three shopping malls had agreed to commence
advertising/sponsoring. The statement related
to a material matter and Mr
Ramsey had regard to it.
<P>

39	The statement referred to in particular 12(d) is first found on the same
page of the information furnished on 21 January 1995,
but was renewed by other
statements which carried to figures assertions about the opportunity to
establish a substantial cashflow.
A sheet of figures furnished with Mr Davies'
letter of 23 January 1995 was described in that letter as "<i>further
information on the operation of Welcome Waggon of Australia</i>". Mr Ramsey
must have understood this as a projection and not a narration of what had
actually happened in operations because it
was in other ways made clear to him
that there were no actual operations in New South Wales. The line of this
document is to develop
the possible income which would be produced if for each
suburb and town ten advertisers agreed that each would pay $2.50 per call
for
calls to be made on each purchaser of a house. The projections were obviously
very optimistic and there is no indication in evidence
that Mr Ramsey took them
seriously. 
<P>

40	However, Mr Davies' letter of 9 February 1995 furnished much more extensive
calculations described in that letter as "<i>completed cashflow statements and
calculations schedules for your requirements</i>". Mr Davies' evidence about
what he understood those requirements to be was to the effect that information
was not furnished for
Mr Ramsey to rely on in making his decision to purchase,
as Mr Davies' position was that Mr Ramsey had already made a decision to
purchase, but that the requirement was that Mr Ramsey should furnish the
information to his bank in connection with an application
for finance. In my
concept if that were the case that would do nothing to diminish but if anything
would enhance the need for the
completed cashflow statements and calculation
schedules to be reliable. The whole of the letter is significant and I set it
out:-
<P>

	<i>"Dear Lester</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	Further to our recent discussion we now enclose herewith completed cash
flow statements and calculation schedules for your requirements.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	The information has been prepared taking into account:</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	That the areas as outlined would be established during the first twelve
months of operation.</i>
<P>

41	It is noteworthy that the letter included the statements "<i>We believe that
is possible to achieve these results" and "The information ...... has been
calculated to the best of our knowledge.</i>" An important part of the context
in which information was given by this letter was  that the information was
furnished by Mr Davies
acting on behalf of the intending vendor, whose business
was said to have operated with success in Queensland for twenty-eight years,
and was furnished for the information of the proposing purchaser and the
purchaser's bank. Although the information was said by the
Defendant in a
pleading to have been "<i>...... based on figures taken from the operation of
the said business in the State of Queensland and extrapolated, by way of
example,
for New South Wales</i>" both Defendants in their evidence  denied
that they were extrapolated from operations in Queensland. During the
negotiations Mr
Ramsey sought information relating to the experience with the
business in Queensland and Mr Davies and a solicitor on his behalf
refused to
furnish it; there was continued discussion on this subject as it was related to
the terms of a clause relating to the
information on which the purchaser (the
Third Plaintiff) had relied which after modification became clause 5 of the
agreement as
made. Given their source and the statements in the letter of 9
February 1995 the cashflow statements and calculation schedules could
only have
been understood by their recipient as intended to show how there was, as
earlier expressly represented, a genuine opportunity
to establish a substantial
cashflow and obtain a return for franchising and selling areas, and that this
demonstration was based
on the experience, including the Queensland experience,
of the vendor. There was no other impression which it could reasonably have
produced; in particular it could not have been understood as a product of the
imagination unrelated to any experience, or as a set
of good figures intended
to give comfort to Mr Ramsey's bank but otherwise not of significance. Overall
the communications which
led to these documents and the documents themselves
conveyed, in a clear way, that the results depicted were reasonably achievable
by operating the Business System, and that there was a genuine opportunity to
establish the cashflow which they illustrated.
<P>

42	The cashflow statements projected a cashflow of $287,950 positive in twelve
months commencing May 1995, with a surplus income
of $141,210 over operating
costs for that period. The basis of the cashflow projections was that in each
month a significant number
of sponsorships would be obtained from retailers for
several suburbs, and that in each month the area of operation would be
expanded.
It was projected that in May 1995 sponsorship would be obtained in
Parramatta from six retailers for 70 calls out of 145 available
maximum monthly
calls (meaning calls at residences), from six retailers in Strathfield for
twenty-five calls (the maximum available)
and from six retailers in Auburn for
thirty calls (the maximum available); and also for 120 calls at $15 each from
shopping complexes;
with total revenues for the month $3,675. Then the
projection was based on extensions of the field operations each month and
corresponding
cumulative increases in the monthly income to a point where in
April 1996, after twelve months of effective operation, monthly income
would be
$45,000.
<P>

43	This projection had no imaginable relation to actual experience of Mrs
Vogler in conducting the business in Queensland, and of
course no relation
whatever to experience of Mrs Kannapian. As appears by Exhibit E, the number of
retail sponsors in Queensland
in the month of January 1995 in all towns and
suburbs was fifty-five and the number of shopping centres, six; the number of
paying
calls for that month was 1269 and the average value of paying calls for
retailers was $2 and for shopping centres $14. The actual
results of Mrs
Vogler's operations for the year to 30 June 1995 appear in a copy of her tax
return, Exhibit 2, which shows her business
produced a net profit on accounting
principles of $4,788.90, adjusted upwards so as to comply with taxation law
relating to allowable
deductions to $5,515.87.
<P>

44	In relation to this actual experience, Mr Davies' projections, which assume
that after twelve months there would be 226 retailer
sponsors and twelve
shopping centres and that there would be 42,690 paying calls for the year with
revenue of $45,000 in the twelfth
month and $287,950 for the year, were
altogether fantastic; they had no actual relation to any experience and any
appraisal of actual
experience would demonstrate, to any honest person
considering the matter reasonably, that Mr Davies' projection could not
realistically
be achieved in any circumstance.
<P>

45	In my finding Mr Davies as a rational man must have known that it was untrue
to say "<i>we believe that it is possible to achieve these results</i>" and
also to say "<i>the information contained in the schedules has been calculated
to the best of our knowledge</i>" and also must have known that it was untrue
to say that the business provided a genuine opportunity to establish a
substantial cashflow.
Whether that statement was exemplified by the schedules
which he later produced, or in any other way, the schedules were beyond the
range of anything that he can have believed in, not only in respect of
projections bearing on the amount of business which could
be obtained, but also
in detail with respect to the rates of sponsorship revenue to be charged.
<P>

46	For these reasons the charge of fraud in particular 12(d) has been
proved.
<P>

47	The representations referred to in particular 12(d) were material and were
acted on by Mr Ramsey. On behalf of the Defendants
it was contended that they
were not material in that Mr Ramsey had decided to purchase the business before
the representations were
made. In my finding however, the fact that
negotiations including negotiations in detail about the terms of the proposed
agreement
long continued demonstrates that Mr Ramsey remained open to decision,
on price and on other matters. Indeed his freedom of action
continued until 24
March 1995. 
<P>

48	A number of other supposed inaccuracies in the information furnished were
the subject of evidence but it is I think sufficient
that I should make
findings on the particulars of fraud found in the pleadings. One matter which
received considerable attention
was related to the statement in the
advertisement that there was no selling. Of course the heart of the business,
and essential for
its success, is that the business should obtain sponsorships
from retailers and negotiate with retailers, including shopping malls,
for
their agreement to pay sponsorship fees. In ordinary language, negotiating
sponsorship arrangements and obtaining the agreement
of retailers to pay for
sponsorship services is an exercise in selling and would plainly be so
understood. The statements in the
advertisement "<i>No stock required. No
selling required</i>" were sought to be justified by Mrs Vogler and by Mr
Davies as it is undoubtedly the fact that no stock is required as no goods are
sold in the business. In ordinary language however the business does involve
selling. The information furnished by Mr Davies after
21 January would, to my
reading, have made it clear to any reasonable reader that, although there were
no goods to be sold, there
was a need to sell the services of the business to
retailers. Mr Ramsey and also Mrs Ramsey claimed that they did not understand
this and found out about it only after 24 March during the training period. I
do not accept that this is true, as it appears to me
that with any attempt to
develop an understanding of the business the need to obtain sponsorships would
soon be clearly seen. Grievance
on this subject seems to have sunk deep into Mr
Ramsey, but it was not represented in any particular of fraud or misconduct and
I
do not see it as ultimately important.
<P>

49	In consequence of the findings I have made Mr Ramsey is entitled to recover
damages for fraud from Mr Davies. I have deferred
the assessment of damages, in
accordance with equity practice, and I will now direct an enquiry as to
damages. (In retrospect it
is difficult to see why this litigation was
commenced in the Equity Division or why it was commenced in the Supreme Court).
I do
not at this point have a clear concept of how Mr Ramsey's loss should be
expressed but it is clear that it is not to be equated with
a claim by the
Third Plaintiff, or by all three Plaintiffs, and loss occasioned to Mr Ramsey
himself by Mr Davies' fraud and Mr Ramsey's
reliance on it must be identified.
This must be left to a later stage of the litigation.
