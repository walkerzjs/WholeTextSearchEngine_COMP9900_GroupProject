<b><u>21262/95  -  JOHN TINGLE &amp; ANOR  v  HARBOUR RADIO PTY LTD &amp; ANOR
[No 2]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>  </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> :  The plaintiff, John Tingle, has brought an action for
defamation against the company responsible for operating Radio 2GB.  The
action
arises out of a broadcast on 1 November 1995 by Radio 2GB in which their
announcer Ron Casey said the following words:
<P>

	"I was talking about the Shooters' Party and the Shooters' Party is in debt to
the State Government.  Now we hear a lot about them,
you know, beating their
chests and they have got all this political strength and they - well they have
money coming in from the United
States and the Shooters' Party in a Court case
High Court Judge Sir Harry Gibbs appointed as a mediator on May 26 he said the
Shooters'
Party must pay back the principal of the loan made to them by the
State Government and the legal costs and the interest, which means
the
Shooters' Party John Tingle's crowd, is in debt to the State Government to the
tune of $880,000.  That's right $880,000.  Okay
fellas, shut up until you pay
your bill, okay, just be quiet until you have paid your bill".
<P>

2	The plaintiff asserts in the context of certain facts which are notorious,
and which are conceded to be notorious by the defendant,
that the words spoken
gave rise to certain defamatory imputations.
<P>

3	The facts are these:
<P>

&#183;	First that Mr John Tingle is a member of the Legislative Council of New
South Wales, being the sole representative of the
Shooters' Party.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, that Mr Tingle is a person prominently identified with the
Shooters' Party.
<P>

4	On the basis of these notorious facts it is said that the publication, on the
natural and ordinary meaning of the words used,
gave rise to the following
imputations, each of which was defamatory of the plaintiff:
<P>

(a)	the first plaintiff had bragged publicly about the political strength and
secure financial position of the Shooters' Party,
knowing that both boasts were
untrue.
<P>

(b)	the first plaintiff was a foolish politician in that he allied himself to a
political party whose members made unfounded boasts.
<P>

5	The defendant has submitted that the words published were not capable of
giving rise to either imputation, and a verdict should
therefore be entered for
the defendants.
<P>

6	The submission made by the defendants in broad terms is along the following
lines:  First, it is suggested that the words published
could not be construed
as an attack upon the  plaintiff.  They may be an attack upon the Shooters'
Party, but that's a different
matter.
<P>

7	Secondly, there is no basis upon which it can be suggested either that the
words which were published were untrue, or that the
plaintiff had knowledge
that they were untrue.
<P>

8	Thirdly, moving to the second imputation, it is said to be inconsistent with
the first.  It suggests that members of the party,
as opposed to Mr Tingle, did
the bragging.  Further there is no basis upon which it can reasonably be
inferred that the words used
carried a suggestion that Mr Tingle was foolish.
He would only be foolish if he knew at the time he joined the party that
boasting
had occurred.  The words published carry no such suggestion.
<P>

9	In broad terms, in respect of both imputations, the defendants have pointed
to the fact that nothing in the passage, in terms,
makes the accusations which
are contained within either imputation.  Further, no process of reasoning, by
implication or inference,
can give rise to such imputations.
<P>

10	The plaintiff responded to these arguments by drawing attention to the words
of the Privy Council in <b><i>Jones v Skelton</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20644" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) SR (NSW) 644</a>,
where the following was said at page 650:
<P>

	"The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning
or it may be an implied or inferred or an indirect
meaning;  any meaning that
does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general
knowledge but is a meaning which
is capable of being detected in the language
used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words.  (See <i>Lewis
v. Daily Telegraph</i> [1963] 2 All Eng R 151).  The ordinary and natural
meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable
reader guided by not any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered
by strict legal rules of construction would draw
from the words. The test of
reasonableness guides and directs the court in its function of deciding whether
it is open to a jury
in any particular case to hold that reasonable persons
would understand the words complained of in a defamatory sense."  
<P>

11	(See also Hunt J in <b><i>Farquhar v Bottom</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20380" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 380</a> at
380 and 385-386).
<P>

12	Here the plaintiff contends that the notorious facts amount to the
identification of Mr Tingle as the public face of the Shooters'
Party.  He is
its sole member in Parliament.  He is the person that the public associates
with the party.  That association is reinforced
by the reference to him in the
words complained of.
<P>

13	In respect of the first imputation the ordinary reasonable listener would
understand the following:  First, that Mr Tingle had
bragged publicly.  They
point to the words 'beating their chest'.
<P>

14	Secondly, that the matters in respect of which there was boasting are
identified.  They are two in number, namely, their political
strength and their
financial strength.  The reference to money coming from the USA is capable of
implying, according to their argument,
reasonably substantial sums of money
flowing to the party.
<P>

15	Thirdly, that the party in fact owes a substantial sum, almost $1 million
($880,000), which fact is said by Mr Casey in a sneering
tone.  They contrast,
therefore, the boasts, on the one hand, and what they suggest is the reality,
on the other.
<P>

16	It is the juxtaposition of the two which is capable of suggesting that the
boasts of the plaintiff were both untrue, and known
to be untrue.  A clear
implication is that Mr Tingle does not have the political clout or the
financial strength which he has claimed
on behalf of the party.  That
impression they say is reinforced by the final words in the broadcast:  Namely,
"Okay fellas, shut
up until you pay your bill, okay, just be quiet until you
have paid your bill".
<P>

17	In respect of the suggestion that the second imputation is inconsistent with
the first, counsel for the plaintiff very properly
has drawn my attention to
the remarks of the then President of the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Drummoyne
Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i></b> ((1990)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20NSWLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21
NSWLR 135)</a> where, at 148, his Honour drew attention to two authorities which
suggested that the plaintiff may not allege two inconsistent or
contradictory
imputations.
<P>

18	Here however counsel for the plaintiff asserts that the two imputations are
not contradictory.  They are capable of being read
together.  Mr Tingle may
have made boasts, but other members of the party may have made the same boasts,
and he is foolish because
he joined up with such people.
<P>

19	These, then, are the arguments.  I have not found the issue easy to
determine.  I have reservations as to whether the material
published is capable
of conveying the imputations pleaded.  However, on balance, I am persuaded that
the material is arguably capable
of carrying the imputations, and that the
matter should go to the jury.
<P>
