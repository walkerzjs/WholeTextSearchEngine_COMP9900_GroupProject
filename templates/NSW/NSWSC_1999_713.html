<i>Wednesday, 14 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1603/99	ALAMA PTY LIMITED &amp; ANOR   -v-   MARIA JOSEPH JONG</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:    </b>By order made on 28 June 1999 Mr Justice
Young committed the hearing of the entirety of these proceedings to a Master.

<P>

2   	The proceedings were instituted by the plaintiffs, Alama
Pty Limited and Attilio Marinangeli by summons filed by them on 5
March 1999.
The defendant named in that summons is Maria Joseph Jong. 
<P>

3   	By that summons the plaintiffs claim the following
substantive items of relief: 
<P>

1.	A declaration that a binding and enforceable agreement was entered into
between the parties on 4 June 1997.
<P>

2.	A declaration that the defendant be entitled to enter judgment for the
plaintiff in the sum of $53,000 and each party to pay
their own costs in
proceedings in the District Court number 2723 of 1998 at Sydney. 
<P>

4   	The defendant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on
22 June 1995. Apparently the circumstances of that accident gave
rise to her
having entitlement to worker's compensation payments. She was off work for some
weeks. She received worker's compensation
payments in respect of her wages and
also in respect of medical expenses. 
<P>

5   	Proceedings were instituted by the defendant in the
Compensation Court of New South Wales, being matter 16961 of 1995. The
worker's
compensation insurer was the MMI Insurance Company, the insurer in respect to
any common law entitlement which the defendant
might have had arising out of
the motor vehicle accident (that is, what has been referred to as the third
party claim of the defendant)
was NRMA Insurance Company (to which I shall
refer as "NRMA"). The defendant retained the services of a solicitor, Mr
Asheesh Kalmath,
in respect of whatever entitlements she might have had arising
out of her injuries. 
<P>

6   	Mr Kalmath acted for the defendant whilst he was employed
by a firm of solicitors Delfino &amp; Delfino. The defendant instructed
Mr
Kalmath in July 1995 to bring a claim for compensation for the personal
injuries which she had sustained in the motor vehicle
accident. When Mr Kalmath
moved to another firm of solicitors, Stewart Levitt and Co the defendant became
a client of that firm also.
Subsequently, Mr Kalmath commenced practice on his
own account and the defendant continued to be his client. 
<P>

7   	Mr Kalmath was aware of the fact that the defendant
received payment from her worker's compensation insurers. He apparently
retained Counsel concerning the worker's compensation proceedings. On the day
that those proceedings were to come on for hearing,
which was 1 May 1997, a
decision was made by the defendant, her solicitor Mr Kalmath and her Counsel,
that the workers compensation
claim would not be pursued but that a third party
claim arising out of the accident would be pursued by the defendant. The basis
for that decision was that it was apparently believed, at least by the
defendant's legal advisers that the defendant would financially
be better off
by pursuing the common law claim rather than the worker's compensation
claim.
<P>

8   	Accordingly, on 1 May 1997 the defendant, by consent of the
respondent to the worker's compensation proceedings, had the worker's
compensation proceedings struck out. 
<P>

9   	The defendant in the meantime, through her solicitors, had
been negotiating with NRMA Insurance Limited concerning a possible
settlement
of her third party claim. A number of items of correspondence passing between
NRMA and Mr Kalmath, both as an employee
of Stewart Levitt and Co and
practising on his own behalf, have been placed in evidence concerning those
settlement negotiations.

<P>

10   	An original offer was made by NRMA on 12 November 1996.
The letter communicating that offer, which was in an amount inclusive
of costs,
contains the following:
<P>

This offer includes any amounts which are properly payable by way of
reimbursement to the Department of Social Security, workers
compensation
insurer, Health Insurance Commission or private health fund.
<P>

11   	A counter-offer was communicated by Mr Kalmath on 23 May
1997 to NRMA Insurance Limited. That counter-offer was in the sum
of $65,000
inclusive of costs and out of pocket expenses. Mr Kalmath's letter said:
<P>

The offer includes any amounts which are payable by way of reimbursement to the
Department of Social Security, Workers Compensation
insurer, Health Insurance
Commission or private health funds.
<P>

12   	On 2 June 1997 Miss Kylie Anne Brown, a senior claims
officer with NRMA who had the conduct of the matter on behalf of that
insurer,
telephoned Mr Kalmath's secretary. According to the evidence of Miss Brown she
asked to speak to Mr Kalmath, was told that
he was not in the office, and
requested that a message be left for Mr Kalmath. According to Miss Brown on 4
June 1997 she telephoned
Mr Kalmath's office and again spoke to his secretary,
asked to speak with him and was informed that he was in court. According to
Miss Brown, she said to the secretary, "Can I leave a message for him to call
back in relation to a counter-offer?" Miss Brown said
in her evidence that
later on 4 June 1997 Mr Kalmath returned her call and he said, "Can we split
the difference to $53,000 inclusive?",
to which Miss Brown said, "Yes, I can do
that and I will send out the agreement for release and indemnity as well as an
HIC section
23 notice". 
<P>

13   	Miss Brown has annexed to her affidavit file notes which
she recorded on 2 June 1997 and on 4 June 1997. According to Miss
Brown, in the
telephone conversation which she had with Mr Kalmath's secretary on 2 June 1997
she communicated the amount of an offer
in a total figure of $41,266.59 and
gave a break down of the components of that offer. The breakdown was as
follows: an amount for
general damages, described as 15 percent, $16,550; out
of pocket expenses $1,608; past economic loss $500; worker's compensation
$19,608.59; costs $3,000; total $41,266.59. In her file note in respect to the
conversation of 2 June 1997 Miss Brown recorded that
the plaintiff's solicitor
was not in the office, that she left a message for him to call her. The file
note then continues, "I will
put forward the following offer", and there then
followed the figures which I have just listed. For 4 June 1997 Miss Brown's
file
notes record, "I phoned the plaintiff's solicitor, was in court, left
message with secretary to call me re counter offer", and then
a later file note
on the same date, "Plaintiff's solicitor phoned, offer split difference, agreed
$53,000 matter settled". 
<P>

14   	Subsequently a document headed Agreement for Release and
Indemnity was sent by Miss Brown to Mr Kalmath. It would appear that
Mr Kalmath
then communicated to Miss Brown a dissatisfaction by his client with the amount
of worker's compensation which would need
to be reimbursed, with the
consequence that the amount which the defendant would receive in her pocket
would be somewhat less than
apparently Mr Kalmath had believed it would be. The
agreement was never signed.
<P>

15   	The defendant subsequently instituted proceedings in the
District Court of New South  Wales at Sydney on 24 April 1998 for
damages
arising out of the motor vehicle accident. 
<P>

16   	The present plaintiffs, for whom NRMA Insurance Limited is
the third party insurer, assert that there is a binding agreement
between the
defendant and the insurer of those plaintiffs as to settlement of the third
party claim. 
<P>

17   	Evidence was given by Mr Kalmath by affidavit and he was
cross-examined on his affidavit, as also was Miss Brown cross-examined
on her
affidavit evidence. According to Mr Kalmath, he returned Miss Brown's telephone
call on a date which he did not in his affidavit
specify but merely described
as mid-1997. In his affidavit he said:
<P>

I recall that I had a telephone attendance on Ms Brown of the NRMA in Mid 1997
when she offered the sum of $41,000.00 in response
to an offer of $65,000.00
which had been put in May 1997. I recall that I stated to her "can you split
the difference, because I
am confident that my client will accept $53,000.00?"
She said, "I think I have instructions to settle on that basis".
<P>

18   	The account given by Mr Kalmath of that conversation is,
it will be appreciated, somewhat different from the account given
by Miss
Brown. Mr Kalmath, rather curiously, appears to have kept no diary notes
whatsoever concerning any communications which he
had either with his client or
with Miss Brown of the NRMA concerning the negotiations in respect to his
client's claim or even concerning
the decision which had been made on 1 May
1997 to abandon his own client's worker's compensation proceedings. 
<P>

19   	The defendant sought to obtain some degree of benefit from
the wording of the file note made by Miss Brown on 2 June 1997
after her
conversation with Mr Kalmath's secretary in which Miss Brown said, "I will put
forward the following offer". She was cross-examined
as to the apparent
inconsistency of that file note with her assertion that she had in fact already
communicated the offer to Mr Kalmath's
secretary. She agreed that the file note
appeared to be inconsistent with her statement that she had already
communicated the offer
and the components of that offer and said that she could
offer no explanation for the apparent inconsistency.
<P>

20   	Had there been some evidence from Mr Kalmath's secretary,
that apparently inconsistency might have achieved some degree of
significance.
There was no evidence from Mr Kalmath's secretary. There was no explanation as
to the absence of any such evidence.

<P>

21   	I am satisfied that Miss Brown in her conversation with Mr
Kalmath's secretary on 2 June 1997 did in fact communicate the
terms of her
offer and the breakdown of the components of that offer.
<P>

22   	To the extent that there is any material difference in the
evidence given by Miss Brown and Mr Kalmath concerning the conversations
which
they had, I prefer the evidence of Miss Brown. The evidence of Mr Kalmath did
not appear to me to be particularly reliable,
and indeed on a number of
instances Mr Kalmath said that he was not sure about the accuracy of his
apparent recollection of certain
matters. He had no supporting material, such
as file notes, to assist him concerning his communications either with his
client or
with Miss Brown and relied upon his memory concerning the vital
telephone conversation on 4 June 1997. 
<P>

23   	It did, however, emerge absolutely clearly from Mr
Kalmath's evidence that he regarded all settlement negotiations to be in
respect to a figure which would be inclusive of various amounts, including any
worker's compensation liability which might have to
be repaid by the defendant.
Mr Kalmath said that it was his belief that there were would be no such
worker's compensation amount
to be repaid, but that if there was to be such an
amount to be repaid then the proposed settlement figure was inclusive of that
amount.
He offered no reason or no explanation for his belief that there would
not be an amount of worker's compensation to be repaid to
the worker's
compensation insurer. 
<P>

24   	Mr Kalmath, of all people, would have been aware that the
defendant had received payment of worker's compensation by way of
wages and by
way of medical expenses, since he had had the carriage of the defendant's claim
in the Compensation Court. 
<P>

25   	Curiously, in the light of his correspondence with NRMA
Insurance Limited and in the light of his express evidence today that
all
negotiations with NRMA were on the basis that any settlement figure would
include any reimbursements which the defendant must
make to the worker's
compensation insurer, Mr Kalmath on 4 March 1998 sent a letter to the worker's
compensation insurer MMI Insurance,
in which he said, "The plaintiff accepted
the offer in principle and was of the belief that the offer was inclusive of
the MMI workers
compensation pay back figure which is $17,190.19". That
statement is very difficult to reconcile with Mr Kalmath's oral evidence
today
and with his correspondence with NRMA Insurance Limited. 
<P>

26   	I consider that the evidence of Mr Kalmath where it is at
variance with that of Miss Brown cannot be relied upon. But, as
I have already
recorded, on the essential point the evidence of Mr Kalmath was totally
consistent with that of Miss Brown. Mr Kalmath
agreed that, following the
telephone conversation he had with Miss Brown on 4 June 1997, he believed that
there had been a settlement
of his client's claim because he believed that in
that conversation an offer had been made by him which was to split the
difference
between the NRMA's previous offer and his previous offer, to come to
an amount of $53,000 inclusive, and he believed that proposal,
which he
regarded as an offer, had been accepted by Miss Brown on behalf of NRMA. 
<P>

27   	It was submitted, however, on behalf of the defendant that
despite that, belief on the part of Mr Kalmath, there had been
no meeting of
the minds in the conversation of 4 June 1999. I do not accept that submission.
It is quite clear that there was a meeting
of the minds. The meeting of the
minds was as to an amount and that amount being inclusive of certain
components. Whether or not
Mr Kalmath was aware of the amount of the workers
compensation component, even going so far as to accept his evidence that he
believed
that that component was in a nil amount, he was of the belief that the
figure of $53,000 included whatever liability there might
be upon his client to
reimburse MMI Insurance Limited. If Mr Kalmath had been so rash as to have
negotiated the settlement without
satisfying himself as to how much the amount
of that reimbursement was, that fact would in no way preclude there being a
meeting
of the minds which would result in a binding settlement. 
<P>

28   	It was not disputed on the part of the defendant that Mr
Kalmath had ostensible authority to negotiate the settlement with
the NRMA. If
he negotiated such a settlement his client was bound by it. If she had not
authorised him to negotiate it, either at
all or in the specific terms in which
it was negotiated, it might be that Mr Kalmath would find himself under some
personal liability
to his client. That would not have any effect upon the
settlement which had been achieved. 
<P>

29   	It was also submitted on behalf of the defendant that the
consequence of the Agreement for Release and Indemnity and the figures
which
had been inserted in clause 2(b) and 2(d) concerning the amounts to be deducted
from the $53,000 (being the amount payable
to the workers compensation insurer,
and an amount which had been paid by the NRMA itself for out of pocket
expenses) had the effect
of introducing what might be described as a further
term to the agreement which had not been agreed to by the defendant. Mr Kalmath
was informed, when his offer was accepted, that there would be a document which
the NRMA Insurance had in contemplation should be
signed by his client. He did
not demur to the suggestion that such a document of release and indemnity
should be signed. But, in
any event, the plaintiff in the present proceedings
is not seeking to require the defendant to execute such an agreement; the
plaintiff
is merely seeking declaratory relief in respect to the bargain which
had been struck in the telephone conversation between Mr Kalmath
on behalf of
the defendant and Miss Brown on behalf of the plaintiff. 
<P>

30   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has fully established an
entitlement to the relief which it seeks in the summons, and I
propose to make
the declarations which are sought. 
<P>

31   	I make the following orders.
<P>

1.	I make declarations as sought in prayers 1 and 2 in the summons.
<P>

2.	I make an order as in prayer 4 in the summons.
<P>

The exhibits may be returned.
