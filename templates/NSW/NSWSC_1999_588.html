<b>6319/91	GWENYTH LOUISE ARMSTRONG v COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These proceedings arise as a result of a disastrous transaction entered into
by a man who had otherwise been a successful small
business man all his life.
His name is Donald John Armstrong.  The transaction was the purchase of a half
interest in a resort at
Salamander Bay.  It was entered into through a company,
D J Armstrong Investments Pty Limited ("Investments").  It turned into a
fiasco.  Investments failed and was in 1993 wound up by order of this Court.
The liabilities of Investments were guaranteed by his
wife, Gwenyth Louise
Armstrong, and it is claimed that her guarantee was secured by mortgages over
properties of hers.  She is the
plaintiff in these proceedings.  The
liabilities were to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ("the Bank") which is
the defendant in
these proceedings.  By its cross claim the Bank claims to
recover moneys against her and to enforce the securities it holds over
her
properties.  She seeks to have the guarantee and the mortgages set aside.
<P>

<b>BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

2	Mrs Armstrong was born on 11 October 1930 at Mungindi.  She was educated at
the Pallamallawa Primary School and then for one year
only at Moree High
School.  Thereafter she completed a one year nursing aide course at the Moree
District Hospital.  She had no other
education.  She then worked as a nurse's
aide, first, for about 10 years at the Narrabri General Hospital and, after
moving to Sydney
in 1961, at the St George General Hospital.  In 1963 she
married her first husband, who was a soldier.  She continued to work as
a
nurse's aide until about 1969.  She then moved for 2 years to Singapore where
her husband was stationed with the Australian Army.
 After her return to Sydney
she resumed work as a nurse's aide.  In 1973 she was divorced from her first
husband and worked as a
helping hand in the Royal Sheaf Hotel at Burwood.  On 5
May 1974 she married Mr Armstrong, whom she had met some years before while
working at the Stonehaven Nursing Home, which he owned.  Since that marriage
she has not been employed and has not done any work
except occasional work at
Mr Armstrong's request in connexion with some of his businesses.  She has had a
savings account and a cheque
account with the Bank but no other bank accounts
of her own.  She has never done any bookkeeping work and does not know how to
read
financial accounts.  Previously to the transactions mentioned in these
proceedings, the only time she remembers being engaged in
a borrowing
transaction was when she bought a motor vehicle under a hire purchase agreement
in about 1969.  She had never previously
bought land or entered into a
guarantee or a mortgage.  She had not, before marrying Mr Armstrong, been a
director or shareholder
of any company.  The first time she ever owned any real
property was when in about May 1975 Mr Armstrong bought her unit 5/24
Queenscliff
Road, Queenscliff ("the Queenscliff property") as a first wedding
anniversary present.  Between 1975 and 1977 she became aware that
she was a
director of Investments, which had been incorporated in 1973 and was thereafter
the vehicle for various of Mr Armstrong's
business ventures.  Originally Mr
Armstrong held 75 per cent of the issued shares in Investments and his brother
held 25 per cent.
 On 3<b> </b>June 1978 the brother's shares were transferred
to Mrs Armstrong.  There is no dispute that, from that time she was the holder
of
25 per cent of the issued shares in Investments, with Mr Armstrong
continuing to hold the other 75 per cent.  She says that she did
not until the
commencement of these proceedings understand the extent of her duties as a
company director.  She still does not have
any great understanding of those
duties.
<P>

3	Mr Armstrong had accounts with the Bank at its Hurstville branch from 1950.
During his career as a businessman he had for many
years been a valued and
trusted customer of the Bank at that branch.  Many employees of the Bank
concurred in this description. 
Furthermore, he was closely friendly with Barry
Moran, who was at the relevant times the Regional Manager of the Bank for its
Southern
Metropolitan (NSW) Region A, which included the Hurstville branch.  He
subsequently became the Bank's Chief Manager Corporate.  They
had known each
other in boyhood.  The closeness of the relationship is attested by evidence of
dinner engagements of the Armstrongs
with Mr and Mrs Moran, both in Sydney and
at Tweed Heads, and of Mr Armstrong being able to telephone and visit Mr Moran
at home
concerning business matters during weekends.  Notes in the Bank's
records attest that Mr Moran from time to time gave directives
and made
decisions concerning Mr Armstrong's affairs and that employees at the branch
were aware that Mr Moran showed an interest
in them.  Mr Moran died on 24 April
1996.  The only form in which his evidence is available is an unsworn witness
statement prepared
for proceedings in the Commercial Division against Mr
Armstrong.  Mr Moran was not, of course, subject to cross examination.
<P>

4	In March 1977 the house property at 20 Beach Street Blakehurst ("the
Blakehurst property") was purchased in the joint names of
Mr and Mrs Armstrong
as their matrimonial home.  As already stated, in 1975 Mr Armstrong purchased
the Queenscliff property as a
first wedding anniversary present to Mrs
Armstrong.  In 1983 there were three transfers of property into Mrs Armstrong's
name.  First,
on 28 April 1983 Mr Armstrong transferred his half share as joint
tenant in the Blakehurst property to her.  Secondly, on the same
day, he
procured the transfer by Investments to Mrs Armstrong of a home unit at Tweed
Heads ("the Tweed Heads property"), one of
two previously purchased there.
Thirdly, there was transferred to her a part interest in the Stonehaven Nursing
Home.  This was subsequently
transferred out of her name and does not play any
further part in these proceedings.  The reason given by Mrs Armstrong for the
transfer
of his share in the matrimonial home is that she felt insecure, had
expressed this insecurity to him and told him that she wished
the property to
be in her name.  The evidence does not really go further than that.  The
transfer to Mrs Armstrong of the Tweed Heads
property recorded a consideration
of $104,000.  Her stated reason for this transfer was that, "I just suggested I
would like to own
one of them."  Mrs Armstrong certainly did not provide the
purchase price of this or the other properties or any part of it from
her own
funds.  As to where the money came from, she said her husband "arranged it".
There is no other evidence of the form of the
transaction.  No relevant
accounts of Investments are in evidence.  It is not even clear on the material
available that Investments
was the beneficial owner of the property<b>.</b>  It
should be said that there is no suggestion in the evidence of any financial
threat hanging over Mr Armstrong or his enterprises
at the time of any of these
transfers of property to Mrs Armstrong.
<P>

5	It would seem that the marriage was never very happy.  About this, more will
be said later.  But, whatever relations were, they
undoubtedly took a turn for
the worse in 1989, when Mrs Armstrong discovered that her husband had bought a
car for another woman.
 Mrs Armstrong's complaint about this brought the
response that Mr Armstrong would buy a car for whomever he pleased.  Mrs
Armstrong
formed the view that he was having an affair with the other woman and
moved out of the matrimonial home at Blakehurst and lived at
Tweed Heads.
Although Mr Armstrong continued to reside in the Blakehurst property, he had
business interests at Tweed Heads, and
he spent a good deal of time there.  Mrs
Armstrong deposes that between May and August 1989 they argued constantly and
during that
time, while she was at Tweed Heads, Mr Armstrong assaulted her for
the first time.  He hit her on the right hand side of her face.
 On another
occasion during the same period he pushed her against a wall bruising her
shoulder.  In about August 1989 she consulted
Mr Foster at Redmond Partners,
Solicitors, at Kogarah about her matrimonial problems and the status of her
property.  In December
1989 she returned briefly to live in the Blakehurst
property and the Armstrongs there entertained to dinner Barry Moran and his
wife,
Denise.  During that dinner, in the absence of Mr Armstrong, but the
presence of Barry Moran, the following conversation took place:
<P>

"Denise Moran said:	`Peg, you look terrible.  Is there anything wrong?'
<P>

I said:	`I'm going through a terrible time with Don.  I'll probably have to
divorce him.  He's wasting money by buying a new car
for a woman he hardly
knows.  Don't let onto [sic] Don that I spoke to you about this.  I don't want
it to be an unpleasant evening.'"
<P>

Soon after that Mrs Armstrong returned to live at Tweed Heads, but she was back
in Sydney when, on 4 March 1990, she picked him
up at Mascot Airport after he
had flown from Coolangatta and drove him to the Blakehurst property where in
the kitchen he told her
that he wanted a divorce.  She declined.  He then flew
into a rage and hit her on the right side of her face causing her nose to
bleed.  She walked out of the kitchen to the swimming pool area.  He followed
her and grabbed her by her neck and shoulders and pushed
her saying, "I'll push
you into the deep end of the pool and keep you there."  She screamed until he
let her go, when she ran next
door, but there was no one home.  After her
return to the house she telephoned the Police who came to the house and
arrested Mr Armstrong.
He was charged with assault.  On 7 March 1990 she swore
out a complaint against him under s 562B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.  Mr Armstrong
corroborates these unworthy acts on his part.  Lest that be thought convenient,
they are also corroborated by the
complaint which Mrs Armstrong swore out, the
terms of which are as follows:
<P>

"The parties have been married for 15 years.  Since April, 1989 the defendant
has become aggressive in his behaviour to the complainant.
 The defendant has
assaulted the complainant in June, 1989, in January, 1990 and most recently on
4th March, 1990 when the Police
were called and the defendant was charged with
assault.  That matter will be before Kogarah Court on 27th March, 1990.  Since
the
assault the defendant has twice threatened the complainant saying `I should
have drowned you'.  Since the assault on 4th March, 1990
the defendant has
constantly harassed the complainant by constantly abusing her."
<P>

In satisfaction of that complaint an apprehended violence order was
subsequently made against Mr Armstrong.  The summons issued
on the complaint
was returnable on 27 March 1990 and on that day the Local Court at Kogarah
ordered Mr Armstrong:
<P>

"not to assault, molest, harass or abuse or otherwise interfere with the
protected person's peaceful occupation of the property
at 20 Beach Street,
Blakehurst."
<P>

That was a temporary order but it was on 30 August 1990 extended up to 11 April
1991.
<P>

6	In August 1990 Mrs Armstrong again consulted Mr Foster of Redmond Partners at
Kogarah who asked her to ascertain how much was
owing to the Bank and advised
her not to sign any further documents for her husband.  Shortly thereafter she
telephoned Barry Moran,
attended at the Bank, was presented with some
documents, found them of little meaning to her, but was, at her request,
informed by
the bank officer that the outstanding amount was then about $1.8
million.  On 27 September 1990 Mr Armstrong flew to Coolangatta
and Mrs
Armstrong picked him up at the airport.  They then visited Barry and Denise
Moran who were holidaying on the Gold Coast and
arranged to meet them for
dinner that evening.  After the daytime visit Mr Armstrong asked Mrs Armstrong
to sign further documents
(not being documents operative in these proceedings).
She refused to do so.  He told her she would have to sign them.  He promised
to
buy her a new car if she would.  She still refused.  During the course of this
argument he hit her in the face causing her mouth
to bleed and grabbed her by
the throat.  Later in the day she went to see a solicitor in Tweed Heads whose
name she believes was
Piper.  He said the only advice he could give her was not
to sign any papers.  Mr Armstrong waited outside the solicitor's office
for her
and drove her to the Tweed Heads branch of the Bank.  She there signed the
documents about which the argument had taken place.
 She says that her reason
for doing so was as follows:
<P>

"I was concerned that if I did not do what my husband wanted me to do I believe
I would have been subjected to abuse and physical
violence.  Eventually I
signed the documents to keep the peace."
<P>

There is no evidence which directly contradicts any of the account set out in
this and the preceding paragraph.  Particularly in
the light of the
contemporaneous apprehended violence complaint and the view I have formed of Mr
Armstrong, to which I shall return,
I accept the matters set out in [5] and [6]
as established.  I should say specifically that I accept that Mrs Armstrong had
the conversation
with the Morans at dinner to which she deposed.
<P>

<b>THE MATERIAL DOCUMENTS</b>
<P>

7	Over the years, Mrs Armstrong executed a considerable number of documents for
the Bank.  Those most material to these proceedings
were set out in a schedule
prepared by the Bank's counsel as follows:
<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

Documents (1), (4), (5) and (6) are documents which the Bank claims create or
secure liability by Mrs Armstrong to the Bank.  The
relevance of documents (2)
and (3) is that they bear same date as document (1) and may go to the
circumstances in which that document
was executed.  They do not themselves
operate to create or secure relevant liability.  Documents (7), (8), (9) and
(10) are acknowledgments
signed by Mrs Armstrong which extend the limit of the
liability that she was under to the Bank.  Documents (9) and (10) were
undoubtedly
executed outside the Bank, one of them being witnessed by Mr
Armstrong and the other by a Mrs Conaghan, who was a neighbour of Mrs
Armstrong's at Tweed Heads.  In document (7) Mrs Armstrong's signature is not
witnessed.
<P>

8	None of the Bank's witnesses claims to remember witnessing any of Mrs
Armstrong's relevant signatures.  Bearing in mind the distance
of time and the
rote nature of such an act, it is hardly surprising that they do not, absent
some quite remarkable event at the time.
 In swearing that they witnessed her
signature they rely upon the fact that their signatures appear as witnesses on
the documents
and what they say was their universal practice in relation to
such signatures.  They also rely on the fact that they say that guarantees
and
mortgages were never allowed out of the Bank for signature but always signed
and witnessed within a Bank branch.  I should add
that the evidence shows that
the Bank's procedures and the general attitude towards the execution and
witnessing of documents generally
tightened up progressively over the years.
The process seems to have commenced in the early to mid 1980s and to have
intensified
over the succeeding years up to 1990.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 33</a> and S 34 forms
referred to hereafter were introduced in 1987 as part of that process.  Factors
in the process were undoubtedly the
entry of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act
1974</a> (Cth) into play as a commonplace of commercial litigation.  Whether or not
<b>Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 447</a> is regarded
as introducing any novelty into the law, the wide attention given it was
perhaps a factor.  In any event, it is clear
that the attitude towards
departures from the rules as to execution and witnessing was more relaxed in
1977, and still in 1983, than
it was thereafter.
<P>

<b>THE EXECUTION OF THE DOCUMENTS</b>
<P>

<b>Mrs Armstrong's Version</b>
<P>

9	As I have said, Mrs Armstrong's account is that all the material documents
were executed by her out of the Bank, and at the instance
and insistence of her
husband.  For example, in relation to document (1), the mortgage over the
Queenscliff property ("the Queenscliff
mortgage"), she deposes as follows:
<P>

"On or about 21 November, 1977 Don brought home at 20 Beach Street, Blakehurst
a number of documents for me to sign.  A conversation
took place to the
following effect:
<P>

Don said:	`Peg, will you sign these documents here please.'
<P>

He then pointed to the particular parts of the documents for me to sign.
<P>

I said:	`What am I signing?'
<P>

Don said:	`Just sign it.'
<P>

I did as I was requested by my husband and signed the documents.  I did not
read through the documents nor did I have explained
to me any part of them."
<P>

Mr Armstrong's version corroborates that.  In relation to document (4) ("the
guarantee"), and document (5) ("the Blakehurst mortgage"),
signed in September
1983, she again deposes that he requested her to sign the documents and that on
that occasion she asked what
she was signing and he replied, "Don't worry
neither you nor your properties are at risk just leave it to me.  Just sign the
documents."
 Her execution of document (6) ("the Tweed Heads mortgage") in
November of that year was in similar circumstances.
<P>

10	At the time these documents were signed there had not been any actual
violence between Mr Armstrong and Mrs Armstrong.  It was
suggested to Mrs
Armstrong in cross examination that, in effect, she was not at those times
frightened of Mr Armstrong and that it
was unlikely she would have remained in
the marriage had she been.  There are two significant passages in her cross
examination,
the first of which presents, in a sense, her vignette of he
marriage as it was in the days before the troubles that commenced in
1989 and
is as follows:
<P>

"Q.  I would like you to tell me how you would describe your relationship with
your husband between the time of the marriage in
1974 - have I got the right
date?
<P>

A.  Yes, sir, you have.
<P>

Q.  And 1989 when you challenged him about him having bought a motorcar for
another woman.  Do you follow the period I am asking
about?
<P>

A.  Yes, sir.
<P>

Q.  I know it covers fifteen years and it may have changed over that time.  If
it did change over that time, well, I would like
you to tell me how it changed
from time to time and about when?
<P>

A.  Right from the very beginning I found him a very difficult man to live
with.  He would run his own businesses and didn't want
me ever to be involved,
which I have no knowledge of so I never forced it on him.  But he has always
been very aggressive if he doesn't
get his own way.  There is one part of the
time, a year after we were married, I went to a priest and told him he was a
very hard
man to live with, and he told me was there anywhere I could go and
live and just move out, and I said at the time, well, I could
go to the unit at
Manly.  I had it at the time given to me.  Even though he gave me that and I
felt it was a wonderful thing to give
me because I had never owned any
properties ever, he was a very difficult man to live with and very
aggressive.
<P>

Q.  Did that sort of state of affairs from the first year continue along more
or less evenly until 1989, or were there significant
changes.  Did it get
better or did it get worse?
<P>

A.  No.  It was always around the same kind of lifestyle until we were at the
motel at Banora Point and he then changed.  He didn't
seem to want to have
anything to do with me, and then I can't recall how I found out, but he met a
lady there that he knew and he
started having correspondence with her.
<P>

Q.  And things got distinctly worse after that?
<P>

A.  Well, I had discovered he had bought a car without consulting me for her
and that made our marriage even worse.
<P>

Q.  I realise there were daily ups and downs, but was the quality of it overall
pretty much the same through from the marriage in
1974 until you went to Banora
Point?
<P>

A.  Yes, yes it was.
<P>

Q.  Why, in the light of that, did you stay in the marriage? We are talking
about fifteen years?
<P>

A.  I felt insecure and while I was with him I felt more secure because I had
somewhere to live and he gave me regular money and
things like that, which
would have been very difficult had I left him.  So by staying with him I had a
security feeling, that I was
living a better lifestyle than what I was before I
married him."
<P>

The second in a sense encapsulates her explanation for signing documents thus
presented to her during that period:
<P>

"Q.  So every time, you say, that he brought home a document for you to sign he
said, `Please sign'?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  What did you say?
<P>

A.  `What am I signing?'
<P>

Q.  And he said?
<P>

A.  `Just sign it'.
<P>

Q.  As far as you can recall you say that is all that was ever said?
<P>

A.  That is right.
<P>

Q.  Mrs Armstrong, if that conversation took place so many times why did you
persist in asking what you were signing?
<P>

A.  Just wanted to know what I was signing.
<P>

Q.  On no occasion, do you say, did he ever tell you what you were signing?
<P>

A.  That is exactly right.
<P>

Q.  When he said what you say he said to you, you simply signed?
<P>

A.  Because he would become violent with me when I didn't sign.
<P>

Q.  The violence episode did not occur until 1990, did it?
<P>

A.  He was always very aggressive with me."
<P>

Asked specifically about the time at which she signed document (1) in 1977 she
said:
<P>

"Q.  May we take it that the marriage was on a perfectly happy and amicable
footing at that time?
<P>

A.  Not that happy.
<P>

Q.  But relationships did not really deteriorate until the late 1980s, did
they?
<P>

A.  No.
<P>

Q.  So that as at 1977 you certainly felt free to talk to your husband?
<P>

A.  He used to become very aggressive if I spoke about business to him."
<P>

11	So far as the acknowledgments are concerned, whilst they were sent out by
post for execution addressed to Mrs Armstrong at the
Blakehurst property, her
evidence is that she did not open business mail, even if addressed to her, but
put it aside for Mr Armstrong.
 She did not read any of the covering letters
sent with the acknowledgments, and, up to 1989, came to sign them in the same
way as
she came to sign the other documents.  By the time of the October 1989
and September 1990 acknowledgments, actual violence had been
applied to her.
Later in September 1990, upon her refusal to sign further documents, Mr
Armstrong again hit her.
<P>

<b>The Bank's Version</b>
<P>

12	<b>The Queenscliff Mortgage.  </b>This bears date 21 November 1977.  The
witness to Mrs Armstrong's signature is Mr Bruton.  On the same day she
executed a mortgage
over a now irrelevant property, that mortgage also being
witnessed by Mr Bruton.  She also executed, jointly with Mr Armstrong, a
mortgage over the Blakehurst property, they at that time being joint tenants of
that property.  That was witnessed by Mr Corcoran.
 All Bank documentation
concerning the execution of these mortgages and the transactions in respect of
which they were executed has
been destroyed and was not available at the trial;
only the mortgage documents themselves were available.  Mr and Mrs Armstrong's
version is that Mrs Armstrong's signatures were procured by Mr Armstrong away
from the Bank and out of the presence of any Bank officer.
 Mr Bruton's
position at the time was documents clerk.  He says that he does not recall the
circumstances of the mortgage being executed.
 He says he does recall being
involved in the execution at the Bank by Mr and Mrs Armstrong on some
occasions.  He says that he never
did that alone but in the presence of either
the manager or senior loans officer.  He says he did not on any occasion
provide any
explanation of documents to Mr and Mrs Armstrong.  He says he does
not recall the nature of any explanation given on the occasion
or by whom.  As
to the mortgage of the same date which he witnessed (document (3)), Mr Corcoran
said that he did not recall witnessing
the mortgage.  He claimed that he never
witnessed a mortgage which had not been signed in his presence.  He said that
it was his
practice as an officer of the Bank when signing a mortgage document
as a witness to the signature of a mortgagor to ensure that he
was actually
present when the mortgagor signed the document.  As to explanations, he says in
relation to third party mortgages involving
the mortgagor's home "my practice
was to say to the mortgagor before the document was being signed, words to the
effect of `this
is a mortgage over your home'".  The Queenscliff mortgage is
expressed to be given in "consideration of certain advances and accommodation
granted or to be granted at the request of the Mortgagor to" Investments.  Mrs
Armstrong had not at that time become a shareholder
of Investments and had on
the evidence no interest in the company.
<P>

13	<b>The Guarantee and the Blakehurst Mortgage. </b> The guarantee bears a
typewritten date 27 September 1983.  It is stated to be given by Mr and Mrs
Armstrong in consideration of advances
and accommodation granted to
Investments.  The signatures of both guarantors are witnessed by Mrs Latham.
In the body of the guarantee
there are initials in only one place:  against
clause 3 and just above clause 4.  They are plainly the initials of Mr and Mrs
Armstrong.
 The original does not bear any sign of any mark indicating that it
should be initialled there.  Mr Armstrong said in evidence that
he was told
that the document should be initialled at that place.  The Blakehurst mortgage
was executed as mortgagor by Mrs Armstrong
alone, she being by then the sole
registered proprietor of the property.  It bears Mrs Latham's signature as
witness to the execution.
 The consideration again is "advances and
accommodation granted or to be granted" to Investments.  The occasion for the
provision
of the security is not clear.  The mortgage bears the date 28
September 1983 in handwritting.  In her affidavit Mrs Latham says that
she does
not recall the circumstances of the execution of the document.  She recalls
speaking with Mr Armstrong in her office on
a number of occasions but has only
a vague recollection of meeting Mrs Armstrong.  She claims that she does not
recall on any occasion
executing a document as a witness when she did not
actually witness the document's execution.  She says that "by September 1983
she
had a practice whereby in the case of a guarantee she would say that the
guarantor was guaranteeing the debts of the debtor (whom
she would name) that
are owed to the Bank".  She would say words to the effect:
<P>

"You are guaranteeing the debts of [here I would name the debtor] that are owed
to the Bank.  You are liable to repay to the Bank
the debts of the debtor
should the debtor fail to repay them.
<P>

The terms of the guarantee are set out in this document.  I must draw your
attention to clause 4 of the guarantee.  Please read
it carefully and then
initial next to this clause recording that you have read it and that you
understand it."
<P>

Mrs Latham continued that she would advert to the unlimited nature of the
guarantee (if it were unlimited) and then ask the guarantor
to the sign at the
place provided in the execution clause.  The terms of the relevant clause 4 are
as follows:
<P>

"4	The Guarantor hereby records and acknowledges to the Bank that every
security already executed or which may at any time and from
time to time be
executed by the Guarantor in favour of the Bank shall also be and remain
continuing security to the Bank for the
payment by the Guarantor to the Bank of
all moneys for the payment whereof the Guarantor is or may be or may become
liable to the
Bank under or by virtue of this Guarantee."
<P>

It may be noted that it is not a model of simplicity or clarity.  Mrs Latham
gave evidence of a practice of saying similar words
in respect of the execution
of a third party mortgage.
<P>

14	<b>The Tweed Heads Mortgage. </b> The Tweed Heads mortgage was signed by Mrs
Armstrong, her signature again being witnessed by Mrs Latham.  The mortgage is
dated in
handwriting 11 November 1983.  The statement of consideration is the
same as in the Blakehurst mortgage.  It seems likely, but it
is not entirely
clear, that this mortgage was given in connexion with the purchase by Rimenu
Pty Limited ("Rimenu") of a newsagency.
 Mrs Latham again has no recollection
of the circumstances of execution, and relies on evidence of her practice as
establishing what
occurred.
<P>

15	<b>The Acknowledgments. </b> As is apparent from the schedule set out in [7]
above, of the four acknowledgments identified as significant in this case, the
signature
of Mrs Armstrong to only one was witnessed by an officer of the Bank.
In document (7), executed in 1984, Mrs Armstrong's signature
is not witnessed.
It was in document (8), dated 15 July 1988, that Mrs Armstrong's signature was
witnessed by Miss Small.  In document
(9), dated 9 October 1989, her signature
was witnessed by Mr Armstrong and in document (10), dated 13 September 1990, it
was witnessed
by Mrs Conaghan, Mrs Armstrong's neighbour at Tweed Heads.  There
seems little doubt that the 1984 acknowledgment was executed outside
the Bank;
it does not purport to be witnessed by a Bank officer and bears what appears to
be a stamp of verification of the signatures
after return of the document.  The
terms of the letter accompanying each of documents (8), (9) and (10) makes it
plain that it was
anticipated these documents would be sent out of the Bank for
signature.  It is therefore not surprising that two of them do not
purport to
have been witnessed by Bank officers.  It is plain that that witnessed by Mrs
Conaghan was executed away from the Bank
and there is no reason to doubt that
the same is true of document (9), witnessed by Mr Armstrong.  The only one of
the acknowledgments
in which a serious case is put forward that the
acknowledgment was executed in the Bank is document (8).  The witness was Miss
Small,
whom I have found to be one of Bank's more satisfactory witnesses.  The
reason for the large extension of credit to Investments on
this occasion was
the purchase by it of a motel at Banora Point.  Miss Small has no recollection
of preparing the letter under the
cover of which the acknowledgment was sent
out or of witnessing Mrs Armstrong's signature to it.  It is clear that these
documents
were at this time customarily sent out of then Bank for execution,
because the letter was in a standard form, known as an <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 33.</a>  It contained the
following:
<P>

"Prior to signing the document you should satisfy yourself that you understand
the full nature and effect of your liabilities to
the Bank and obtain
appropriate advice, legal or otherwise, if you are at all uncertain of your
position.
<P>

Your signature to the document should be witnessed by an adult person
(specially qualified where so called for in the document)
who is not the
borrower/debtor or a co-guarantor/mortgagor (if any) under the document."
<P>

Miss Small made a diary note dated 15 July 1988 concerning the execution.  That
diary note was also in a standard form, known as
an <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 34</a>, which by that time it
had become the practice of the Bank to require its officers to create in
relation to all executions of acknowledgments.
 The terms of that diary note
were as follows:
<P>

"I confirm that Mr &amp; Mrs Armstrong read this letter <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 33)</a> and they were
clearly advised not to sign the document until they understood the full nature
and effect of their liabilities if necessary
by obtaining independent advise
[sic].
<P>

Notwithstanding this explanation they freely signed the documents with apparent
understanding of the nature of the liabilities incurred."
<P>

Miss Small deposed that she could not remember signing a document as a witness
without having seen the signature placed on the document
and that she had never
signed such a diary note if it were not true.  Miss Small says that it was her
practice (presumably when the
acknowledgments were executed in the Bank) to
hand the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 33</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 34</a> to the customer and say words to the effect:
<P>

"This document encloses a letter of acknowledgment which you are asked to sign
by way of security.  If you are unsure or do not
understand your liabilities
under this document you should seek your own legal advice.  You are providing
security for the [here
I would name the debtor].  You are liable for the debt
as recorded in the letter of acknowledgment.  The amount is [here I would
state
the level of the debt recorded in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 34].</a>  The security referred to in the
letter of acknowledgment, namely [here I would state the nature of the security
provided] is available
to the Bank to call up in the event that the debtor
fails to repay its debts to the Bank.  By signing this letter of acknowledgment
you are acknowledging your liability for that debt.  ...
<P>

This is the letter of acknowledgment you are being asked to sign.  Please read
it and sign it if you are happy."
<P>

The four original documents that together constitute Exhibit 14 (Mrs
Armstrong's acknowledgment, Mr Armstrong's acknowledgment and
a request and a
certificate by Investments) have the appearance of having been sent out of the
Bank together.  The request has been
executed by another company, apparently
out of the Bank, as well as by Investments.  It seems strange that, if the
acknowledgments
were sent out, Mrs Armstrong should bring hers back into the
Bank to sign.  Although the acknowledgment does not display irregularities
such
as those commented on by Young J at first instance in <b>Garcia v National
Australia Bank Ltd</b> (1993) 5 BPR 11,996 at 12,008.  I do not think that it
takes the matter much further; if a Bank officer did sign as a witness without
seeing the signature applied, he or she, once S 34s were instituted, would be
likely to complete one to regularise the record.
<P>

16	<b>The Rimenu Guarantee.  </b>The facts relating to the execution of a
document not being one of the series principally under consideration is of some
significance
in relation to the execution of the 1983 documents.  That document
is a guarantee dated 14 March 1984 by Mr and Mrs Armstrong of
obligations of
Rimenu.  It was clearly procured in connexion with the purchase by Rimenu of a
newsagency.  There is no evidence that
Mrs Armstrong had any interest in
Rimenu.  Mrs Latham had some association with this document as there is no
doubt that the names
Donald John Armstrong and Gwyneth Louise Armstrong are
written into the testimonium clauses in her handwriting.  Mrs Armstrong's
signature is witnessed by Mr Armstrong and Mr Armstrong's signature is
witnessed by Mr Rankin.  The document, which is on the same
printed form as the
guarantee, which was executed in September 1983, bears the initials of Mr and
Mrs Armstrong against each of clause
3 and clause 4.  There are crosses against
the places for them to sign in the testimonium clauses.  There is a diary note
of the
Bank manager directing that it be handed out to Mr Armstrong.  Contrary
to what a number of Bank witnesses said was the practice,
it is quite plain on
the evidence that this guarantee was handed out for Mr Armstrong to take away
and have Mrs Armstrong sign..
 Furthermore, Mr Rankin who witnessed Mr
Armstrong's signature, after looking at relevant documentation, deposed that he
signed as
the witness to Mr Armstrong's signature after the document came back
to the Bank and without having seen Mr Armstrong put his signature
on the
document.  In cross examination he conceded that this was not a matter of
recollection, but of inferences drawn from the documentation
referred to.
Despite Mr Rankin's lack of actual recollection, after considering his evidence
and examining the relevant documentation,
I find that his evidence as to
signing as witness although he had not seen Mr Armstrong sign is correct.  Of
course, none of this
evidence proves that any other document was dealt with in
these ways; but it does demonstrate graphically that the proposition that
these
things never occurred is simply not correct.
<P>

<b>THE CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES</b>
<P>

<b>Generally</b>
<P>

17	This case throws up acute and difficult problems of credibility.  Some of
those problems are general and inhere in the distance
in time and the rote
nature of the acts to be remembered.  Whilst in appropriate cases practice may
be probative (see <b>Connor v Blacktown District Hospital</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20NSWLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 NSWLR
713)</a> evidence of a practice as proving the doing of an act must be approached
with caution.  It is stated thus in 1A Wigmore on Evidence
(Tillers Rev) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 92:</a>

<P>

"Of the probative value of a person's habit or custom, as showing the doing on
a specific occasion of the act that is the subject
of the habit or custom,
there can be no doubt.  Every day's experience and reasoning make it clear
enough ..."
<P>

......
<P>

There is, however, much room for difference of opinion about the admissibility
of habit in concrete cases, owing chiefly to the
indefiniteness of the notion
of habit or custom.  If we conceive it as involving an invariable regularity of
action, there can be
no doubt that this fixed sequence of acts tends strongly
to show the occurrence of a given instance.  But in the ordinary affairs
of
life, a habit or custom seldom has such an invariable regularity.  Hence, it is
easy to see why in a given instance something
that may be loosely called habit
or custom seldom should be rejected because it may not in fact have sufficient
regularity to make
it probable that it would be carried out in every instance
or in most instances.  Whether or not such sufficient regularity exists
must
depend largely on the circumstances of each case."
<P>

	The shortcomings of this sort of evidence in cases of this kind were commented
on by Young J in <b>Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd</b> supra at 12,006 -
7 and by McLelland CJ in Eq in <b>State Bank of NSW v Muir </b>(1997) 8 BPR
15,483 at 15,488.  In this case, there were suggestions by witnesses for the
Bank that mortgages and guarantees were
never allowed out of the Bank for
signature and that they knew of no instance where this had occurred.  Similarly
some witnesses
said that they knew of no instance of a Bank officer signing as
witness to a signature where the signature had not been applied in
his or her
presence.  The facts concerning the Rimenu mortgage I have already recorded in
[16].  In addition, a Mr Garrett, who was
formerly a branch manager of the
Bank, deposed that up to about 1986 he had had a practice of witnessing the
signatures of valued
customers with whom he was well acquainted without having
seen them sign.  He on at least one occasion wtnessed the signature of
the wife
of such a customer, although he did not see the wife sign, and had not met her.
I accept this evidence of Mr Garrett.  The
documents concerned had nothing to
with this case, but, again, the proposition that the practices contended for by
the Bank were
never departed from is proved simply to be incorrect.  The
departures were in respect of valued customers whom the Bank trusted.
 It is
clear that Mr Armstrong was in this category.  Numbers of witnesses said so and
no witness denied or cast doubt upon it. 
It also seems likely that Mr
Armstrong's position was enhanced by his relationship with Barry Moran, the
Regional Manager, which
various notations in the files show was well known in
the branch.  Another complicating factor is that, in relation to a number of
the transactions, the surrounding documents have been destroyed by the Bank in
the fullness of time.  This is certainly so in the
case of the 1977
documentation and also substantially so in the case of the 1983 documents.  All
that remains is the signed documents
themselves.  I should say at once that
there is nothing sinister in this; there is no suggestion that the documents
have been destroyed
to preclude their production, but the fact remains that
they simply do not exist, which is unfortunate in relation to transactions
that
are still alive.
<P>

<b>Mr Armstrong</b>
<P>

18	Mr Armstrong impressed as a somewhat brusque man with a direct and forceful
manner.  He obviously prided himself on his business
acumen and his successful
conduct of affairs until the catastrophe.  He impressed as a man who would
generally be likely to tell
the truth, out of pride if nothing else.  He also
impressed as a man very certain of his own views and of the rightness of any
course
of action on which he embarked.  Whatever the Armstrongs' present
relationship, and that was not entirely clear from the evidence,
and whatever
his motivation, one had the feeling that he was determined that Mrs Armstrong's
property be saved from the Bank if at
all possible.  The great reservation
about his credibility is that he clearly and squarely avowed that he had lied
on oath in an
examination before a Bankruptcy Registrar with the motive of
keeping property from his creditors.  He thus squarely marked himself
as a man
prepared to lie on his oath when it would serve his purposes, particularly his
financial purposes.  He struck as a man determined
to have his own way.  His
manner made it easy to believe that he had assaulted Mrs Armstrong as is
otherwise alleged in the evidence,
when he felt he was thwarted.  It is also
easy to believe that prior to any assault he had brusquely and with a degree of
menace
demanded compliance with his wishes, particularly in financial
matters.
<P>

<b>Mrs Armstrong</b>
<P>

19	Mrs Armstrong was cross examined long and stringently.  In general terms she
adhered to her evidence despite this cross examination.
 One area, however, in
which her credibility received damage again related to Mr Armstrong's
examination in bankruptcy.  She, unlike
he, was not prepared to avow that she
had given evidence that was not true.  However, I formed the opinion that she
had done her
best to keep from the Registrar factual matter relating to rent
received by her from a property and, in the end, she in effect conceded
that
she had been attempting to do so.  Her evidence before me on the same subject
matter was also unsatisfactory.  This is of significance
because the subject
matter relates to money and the keeping of property from creditors of Mr
Armstrong.  It constitutes a compromise
of her credit.  However, her evidence
was not clearly demonstrated to be inaccurate in other regards and her credit
was not, in my
view, otherwise seriously compromised.  I regard her as a much
more reliable witness than Mr Armstrong and her testimony must receive
serious
consideration as a possibly accurate version of events.
<P>

<b>Mr Bruton</b>
<P>

20	Mr Bruton witnessed documents (1) and (2).  He was no longer employed by the
Bank.  He impressed me as a witness of little credibility.
 He gave the
appearance of not wishing to be in the witness box and of not being prepared to
apply his mind with any great seriousness
to the matters to which it was
directed, which admittedly involved him in casting his mind back more than 20
years.  His evidence
contained inconsistencies and some of it was demonstrably
wrong.  I regard him as a witness of low credibility.
<P>

<b>Mr Corcoran</b>
<P>

21	Mr Corcoran was the witness to document (3) in 1977.  It was no longer an
operative document, its only significance being that
it was allegedly executed
on the same occasion as documents (1) and (2).  Unlike Mr Bruton, he was a
witness whose credibility was
not detracted from by his demeanour or cross
examination.  It must be remembered, however, that his mind, too, is reaching
back more
than 20 years.  He does not, in any event, purport to remember the
events and, when he speaks about what occurred and did not occur
by way of
practice in a Bank branch 20 years ago, he faces formidable problems in
accuracy of recall.
<P>

<b>Mrs Latham</b>
<P>

22	Mrs Latham was still in the employ of the Bank.  She witnessed documents
(4), (5) and (6).  In the early stages of her oral evidence,
I found her an
impressive witness.  She is of pleasant appearance and pleasant personality and
appeared to be using her best endeavours
to recount accurately the events and
circumstances of the relevant past.  However, Mrs Latham's evidence was
seriously compromised
by an accidental event during the course of her cross
examination.  The accident was that Mr Martin, of counsel for the plaintiff,
erroneously put to her one afternoon that a document which he showed her was a
document relevant to her evidence and that it demonstrated
that her evidence
concerning execution was wrong.  I should say at once that Mr Martin was the
first person the following morning
to draw attention to his mistake.  He avowed
and apologised for it and for having misled the witness as to the identity of
the document.
 It should also be said that the mistake was not perceived the
previous afternoon by either the witness, the bench or either of the
counsel
for the Bank.  The difficulty that was created for Mrs Latham's credibility by
this incident was that, as soon as the evidence
she had given in favour of the
Bank was apparently compromised and rendered impossible by the error as to the
identity of the document,
she immediately began giving another version, not
previously heard of, but which established the Bank's case.  In light of this
incident
and observation of her during considerable further cross examination,
I formed the view that Mrs Latham was a witness who was absolutely
determined
that things had occurred properly and in accordance with the Bank's procedures
and was absolutely determined to say so
whatever was occurring.  In my view,
her credibility as a witness was severely compromised by the incident I have
referred to and
this tendency.
<P>

<b>Miss Small</b>
<P>

23	Miss Small also was still in the Bank's employ,  She was a much more
impressive witness.  There was nothing in her demeanour
or her cross
examination which in effect detracted from her version of affairs.  Again,
however, that version depends entirely upon
her signature appearing on certain
documents and her recollection or perception as to what her practice had been
at that time.  The
time of the events she was deposing to, although
comparatively recent in terms of this case, was a good 10 years ago, and her
recollection
was not of the events themselves, but merely of her practice at
that time and whether or not there were ever any exceptions to it.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Claim</b>
<P>

24	Although put on many bases, in the end the basis for relief that was in the
forefront of Mrs Armstrong's case was the principle
in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2063%20CLR%20649" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 63 CLR 649</a>, as affirmed by the High Court in <b>Garcia v National
Australia Bank Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 1243.</a>  That was not always so.  The
evidence and submissions in this case were completed before the High Court
handed down the decision
in <b>Garcia</b>.  The matter was then relisted before
me for further submissions on the basis of that decision.  At the time of the
evidence and
the previous argument what was binding upon me in this regard was
the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal in <b>National Australia Bank Ltd v
Garcia</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 577</a> per Sheller JA at 598 that "the so-called
principle in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b> should no longer be applied in New South
Wales."  The basis on which the Court of Appeal had taken that stance was that
<b>Yerkey v Jones</b> was based upon an outdated view of society generally and
the role of women in society in particular.
<P>

25	In <b>Garcia</b> the High Court returned to the principles applicable to
determine where the loss falls as between a lender and a wife (who may both
be
innocent) in respect of a husband's unsatisfied liabilities guaranteed by the
wife.  It considered both the decision under appeal
and also the rather
different approach of the House Lords in <b>Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien
</b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 AC 180.</a>  The High Court rejected the approach of the Court of
Appeal and also differed from that taken by the House of Lords.  The approaches
have been usefully discussed by Santow J writing extra curially:  GFK Santow,
"Sex, Lies and Sureties - Touching the Conscience of
the Creditor"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2010%20Journal%20of%20Banking%20and%20Finance%20Law%20and%20Practice%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 10

Jones</b> was reaffirmed by the majority of the High Court (Gaudron, McHugh,
Gummow and Hayne JJ) as follows:
<P>

"[20]	That Australian society, and particularly the role of women in that
society, has changed in the last six decades is undoubted.
 But some things are
unchanged.  There is still a significant number of women in Australia in
relationships which are, for many and
varied reasons, marked by disparities of
economic and other power between the parties.  However, the rationale of
<b>Yerkey v Jones</b> is not to be found in notions based on the subservience
or inferior economic position of women.  Nor is it based on their vulnerability
to exploitation because of their emotional involvement (<b>Barclays Bank Plc v
O'Brien</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 AC 180</a> at 198, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson; cf <b>Wilkinson

was concerned with actual undue influence.
<P>

[21]	So far as <b>Yerkey v Jones</b> proceeded on the basis of the earlier
decision of Cussen J in <b>The Bank of Victoria Ltd v Mueller</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1925%5d%20VLR%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1925] VLR
624</a>, it is based on trust and confidence, in the ordinary sense of those words,
between marriage partners.  The marriage relationship
is such that one, often
the woman, may well leave many, perhaps all, business judgments to the other
spouse.  In that kind of relationship,
business decisions may be made with
little consultation between the parties and with only the most abbreviated
explanation of their
purport or effect.  Sometimes, with not the slightest hint
of bad faith, the explanation of a particular transaction given by one
to the
other will be imperfect and incomplete, if not simply wrong.  That that is so
is not always attributable to intended deception,
to any imbalance of power
between the parties, or, even, the vulnerability of one to exploitation because
of emotional involvement.
 It is, at its core, often a reflection of no more or
less than the trust and confidence each has in the other."

The majority further said:
<P>

"[23]	In his reasons for decision in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b>, Dixon J dealt with
at least two kinds of circumstances:  the first in which there is actual undue
influence by a husband over a
wife and the second,  that dealt with in
<b>Mueller</b>, in which there is no undue influence but there is a failure to
explain adequately and accurately the suretyship transaction which
the husband
seeks to have the wife enter for the immediate economic benefit not of the wife
but of the husband, or the circumstances
in which her liability may arise.  The
former kind of case is one concerning what today is seen as an imbalance of
power. In point
of legal principle, however, it is actual undue influence in
that the wife, lacking economic or other power, is overborne by her
husband and
goes surety for her husband's debts when she does not bring a free mind and
will to that decision.  The latter case is
not so much concerned with
imbalances of power as with lack of proper information about the purport and
effect of the transaction.
 The present appeal concerns circumstances of the
latter kind rather than the former."
<P>

The wife in <b>Garcia</b> was a professional woman who conducted a practice as
a physiotherapist and otherwise had business experience but who was not
informed
as to the transaction of guarantee that she entered into on her
husband's behalf.  The basis on which the wife was afforded relief
was set out
as follows:
<P>

"[31]	The principles applied in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b> do not depend upon the
creditor having, at the time the guarantee is taken, notice of some
unconscionable dealing between the husband
as borrower and the wife as surety.
<b>Yerkey v Jones</b> begins with the recognition that the surety is a
volunteer: a person who obtained no financial benefit from the transaction,
performance
of the obligations of which she agreed to guarantee. It holds, in
what we have called the first kind of case, that to enforce that
voluntary
transaction against her when in fact she did not bring a free will to its
execution would be unconscionable. It holds further,
in the second kind of
case, that to enforce it against her if it later emerges that she did not
understand the purport and effect
of the transaction of suretyship would be
unconscionable (even though she is a willing party to it) if the lender took no
steps itself
to explain its purport and effect to her or did not reasonably
believe that its purport and effect had been explained to her by a
competent,
independent and disinterested stranger. And what makes it unconscionable to
enforce it in the second kind of case is the
combination of circumstances
that:
<P>

(a)	in fact the surety did not understand the purport and effect of the
transaction;
<P>

(b)	the transaction was voluntary (in the sense that the surety obtained no
gain from the contract the performance of which was
guaranteed);
<P>

(c)	the lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety
may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters
of business and
therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately
explain the purport and effect of the
transaction to his wife; and yet
<P>

(d)	the lender did not itself take steps to explain the transaction to the wife
or find out that a stranger had explained it to
her."
<P>

The questions of notice to the lender and the way in which the lender may be
protected from the consequences of the wife's position
are dealt with as
follows:
<P>

"[40]	We consider that the only question of notice that arises is whether the
creditor knew at the time of the taking of the guarantee
that the surety was
then married to the borrower.  Other questions of notice do not intrude.
<P>

[41]	As is apparent from what was said in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b> the creditor
may readily avoid the possibility that the surety will later claim not to have
understood the purport and effect of
the transaction that is proposed.  If the
creditor itself explains the transaction sufficiently, or knows that the surety
has received
`competent, independent and disinterested' advice from a third
party, it would not be unconscionable for the creditor to enforce
it against
the surety even though the surety is a volunteer and it later emerges that the
surety claims to have been mistaken."
<P>

26	The following passages from the judgment of Dixon J in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b>
are also material to the present case.  The first deals with the situation
where there is actual undue influence.  His Honour said
at 684:
<P>

"The difficulty, if not danger, thus created of attempting to state the
conditions which must be fulfilled before a given kind of
conduct or of
unfairness amounts to an invalidating cause is greatly increased by the
introduction of the consideration that the
equity must be such as ought to
prevail against the claims of the creditor as a possibly innocent third party.
But it is clearly
necessary to distinguish between, on the one hand, cases in
which a wife, alive to the nature and effect of the obligation she is
undertaking, is procured to become her husband's surety by the exertion by him
upon her of undue influence, affirmatively established,
and on the other hand,
cases where she does not understand the effect of the document or the nature of
the transaction of suretyship.
In the former case the fact that the creditor,
on the occasion, for example, of the actual execution of the instrument, deals
directly
with the wife and explains the effect of the document to her will not
protect him.  Nothing but independent advice or relief from
the ascendancy of
her husband over her judgment and will would suffice.  If the creditor has left
it to the husband to obtain his
wife's consent to become surety and no more is
done independently of the husband than to ascertain that she understands what
she
is doing, then, if it turns out that she is in fact acting under the undue
influence of her husband, it seems that the transaction
will be voidable at her
instance as against the creditor."
<P>

The second passage deals, in the case where there is no actual undue influence,
with what dealing by the creditor is sufficient
to displace the wife's equity.
His Honour said at 685-686:
<P>

"If the creditor takes adequate steps to inform her and reasonably supposes
that she has an adequate comprehension of the obligations
she is undertaking
and an understanding of the effect of the transaction, the fact that she has
failed to grasp some material part
of the document, or, indeed, the
significance of what she is doing, cannot, I think, in itself give her an
equity to set it aside,
notwithstanding that at an earlier stage the creditor
relied upon her husband to obtain her consent to enter into the obligation
of
surety.  The creditor may have done enough by superintending himself the
execution of the document and by attempting to assure
himself by means of
questions or explanation that she knows to what she is committing herself.  The
sufficiency of this must depend
on circumstances, as, for example, the
ramifications and complexities of the transaction, the amount of deception
practised by the
husband upon his wife and the intelligence and business
understanding of the woman.  But, if the wife has been in receipt of the
advice
of a stranger whom the creditor believes on reasonable grounds to be competent,
independent and disinterested, then the circumstances
would need to be very
exceptional before the creditor could be held bound by any equity which
otherwise might arise from the husband's
conduct and his wife's actual failure
to understand the transaction:  cf per Cussen J (1925) VLR at p 649.  If undue
influence in
the full sense is not made out but the elements of pressure,
surprise, misrepresentation or some or one of them combine with or cause
a
misunderstanding or failure to understand the document or transaction, the
final question must be whether the grounds upon which
the creditor believed
that the document was fairly obtained and executed by a woman sufficiently
understanding its purport and effect
were such that it would be inequitable to
fix the creditor with the consequences of the husband's improper or unfair
dealing with
his wife."
<P>

27	The majority of the High Court goes on to adopt the words of Dixon J in
<b>Yerkey v Jones</b> where his Honour pointed out that in the former class of
case nothing short of independent advice to the wife or relief from the
ascendancy of her husband over her judgment would suffice to validate the
transaction, whereas in the second case the effect would
depend on the amount
of reliance placed by the creditor upon the husband for the purpose of
informing his wife of what she was about
to do.
<P>

28	The elements which render enforcement unconscionable in the second class of
case are set out in pars (a) to (d) in <b>Garcia </b>[31].  Adapting that
formulation, the circumstances in which relief will be granted in the first
class may, in the light of the reaffirmation
by <b>Garcia </b>of <b>Yerkey v
Jones</b>, be stated as follows:
<P>

(a)	it is not necessary that the surety did not understand the purport and
effect of the transaction;
<P>

(b)	the transaction was voluntary (in the sense that the surety obtained no
gain from the contract the performance of which was
guaranteed);
<P>

(c)	a lender who is aware that a surety is the wife of a borrower is, in
general terms, not protected against any equity that arises
in the wife's
favour if her execution of the documents is in fact procured by the exercise of
actual undue influence by the husband;
<P>

(d)	the lender will not be affected by the equity only where the wife has had
independent advice or relief from the ascendancy of
her husband over her
judgment and will before executing the documents.
<P>

By virtue of what was said in<b> Garcia</b> [43], "no gain" in (b) should be
understood as meaning no real benefit.
<P>

<b>Findings of Fact</b>
<P>

29	The resolution of this case throws up matters of fact and questions of
credibility of quite some difficulty.  This is particularly
so in relation to
the circumstances of the execution of the various documents.  I have borne in
mind that the executions appear on
their face to have been duly witnessed.  I
have considered earnestly the evidence of the relevant Bank officers with their
varying
degrees of impressiveness as witnesses.  I have borne in mind that none
of them recalls the actual executions in question or the
circumstances
surrounding them.  I have considered earnestly the evidence of the Armstrongs,
bearing constantly in mind the compromises
that exist, to different degrees, of
their veracity.  I have examined the documents themselves, and what evidence
there is of surrounding
documentation and circumstances, with care.  On the
balance of probabilities, I accept Mrs Armstrong's evidence that she did not
sign any of the documents in the schedule in the Bank or in the actual presence
of the bank officers who have signed the same as
witnesses.  I have not
neglected the argument on behalf of the Bank that I could not accept that so
many Bank officers should have
been in derogation of their duty by signing when
they had not seen.  I have not neglected the argument that the initials could
not
have got in the margin of the guarantee unless it had been signed in Mrs
Latham's presence.  As to the former, I bear in mind that
there were proved to
have been deviations from the Bank's practices as to sending documents out of
the Bank and as to witnessing
documents, particularly in the case of
longstanding and valued customers, such as Mr Armstrong was.  As to the latter,
there are
various possibilities as to how the initials got there without any
indication of the place now being visible, including subsequent
erasure of
light pencil marks, indication by sticker, or even Mr Armstrong's answer that
he was told orally, glib as it may seem
at first blush; after all the initials
are not against clause 4, as apparently intended, but rather against the
preceding clause
3.  I do not place any great weight on Mr Armstrong's
corroborative evidence as to the place of execution.  In the end, having
carefully
considered Mrs Armstrong's evidence and her demeanour, together with
all the other evidence going to her execution of the documents
and the
surrounding circumstances, I accept her evidence on this subject matter.
<P>

30	I also find that she signed all the documents in the schedule under Mr
Armstrong's actual undue influence, in the sense in which
that term is used in
<b>Garcia.</b>  I accept her evidence that she signed documents (1) to (8) in
the schedule at Mr Armstrong's insistence and without any explanation
of their
nature and effect.  On a number of occasions he told her that they would not
put her property at risk.  When she asked for
explanations, they were refused.
The impression I have formed of Mr Armstrong to my mind makes it likely that he
would have acted
in this way.  Not only do I accept Mrs Armstrong's version of
the outbreak of actual violence towards her in and after 1989, but
I find that
Mrs Armstrong's vignette of life with Mr Armstrong during the period of the
marriage up to 1989 has the ring of truth,
and that even from the early days of
the marriage there was a tone of aggression, particularly if any inquiry was
made about business
matters, and an undertone of threat.  Asked in
reexamination what she meant by his being aggressive at times before 1989 she
replied
that "he would shout at me and demand of me" and that she was afraid
that if she refused he would hit her.  I accept those answers.
 The outbreak of
actual violence when Mr Armstrong was sufficiently thwarted in 1989 and 1990
gives reality to the underlying fear
which Mrs Armstrong deposes that she had
at earlier times.  It was under the pressure that she felt arising from his
insistence and
aggression that she signed documents (1) to (8).  I accept that
she signed documents (9) and (10), whatever legal advice she had
then had,
under the real fear of a repetition of the actual violence which had by then
been applied to her.  That that fear had reality
was again confirmed by the
application of violence to her late in September 1990, after she had signed
document (10).  I also accept
her evidence that she was induced to stay in the
marriage despite the substratum of fear that it had from the start because of
the
greater deal of security in life that she experienced within the marriage.
In this regard, while some of the findings I have made
in respect of Mr
Armstrong are not complimentary to him, it appears that he acted towards her
with genuine generosity, both in the
gift he made her on their first wedding
anniversary and in his being prepared to transfer his half share of the home
and the Tweed
Heads unit to her in 1983.  I should add, insofar as it is
material, that, at least prior to 1989, Mrs Armstrong reposed trust in
Mr
Armstrong.  Not only were they husband and wife, but he was a competent and
successful businessman which contrasted with her limited
education and lack of
knowledge of affairs.  Nonetheless, it was his insistence and actions that
overbore her will and led her to
sign without explanation as I find she did.
<P>

31	I have already said that I have found the decision as to whether or not the
documents were executed before the Bank officers
a difficult one, which I have
resolved as set out in [29].  I should add that, even if I declined to accept
Mrs Armstrong's evidence
that she executed the documents in the absence of the
Bank officers who signed as witnesses, I should not accept that any explanation
or any adequate explanation was given to Mrs Armstrong of the documents.  Even
if Mrs Armstrong signed the Queenscliff mortgage in
the presence of Mr Bruton,
Mr Bruton does not claim to have proffered any explanation of it.  I do not
accept that Mr Corcoran explained
the Queenscliff mortgage to her, an assertion
based on the speculation that there was a "production line" for the execution
at the
same time of documents (1) to (3) and that Mr Corcoran gave an
explanation in accordance with his then practice.  In any event, his
customary
form of explanation as given in evidence contained no reference to the all
moneys clause and was deficient.  Mrs Latham,
in respect of the 1983 documents,
has no recollection of the circumstances of their execution.  I am not prepared
to accept by reference
to evidence of practice that she uttered the words set
out in her affidavit to Mrs Armstrong at the relevant times, or words to that
effect.  Initials in the general vicinity of clause 4 of the guarantee do not
of themselves supply the deficiency.  Even if I disbelieved
Mrs Armstrong's
evidence as to the circumstances of execution, that disbelief would not supply
the deficiency of the evidence of
explanation:  <b>Scott Fell v Lloyd</b>

<b>Atra v Farmers &amp; Graziers Co-operative Co Ltd </b>NSWCA, 24 October
1985, unreported per McHugh JA (as his Honour then was). Equally, despite Miss
Small's more satisfactory performance
as a witness, I have come to the
conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, I accept Mrs Armstrong's
denial that she signed
document (8) before Miss Small at the Bank.  Again, even
if I had not accepted this denial, but inferred from all the circumstances
that
the document was signed before Miss Small in the Bank, I still should not
accept on the basis of the evidence of practice that
Miss Small uttered to Mrs
Armstrong either the very words which she sets out as being those she said as a
matter of practice or the
substance thereof.  In those circumstances, I am of
the view that document (8) could not operate to cure the defects in the
mortgages
or fix Mrs Armstrong with an extended liability under them.  Indeed,
if the guarantee and the supporting mortgages were vitiated,
I doubt whether
document (8) would cure the vice even if it were accepted that Miss Small
uttered those words. In those circumstances,
were it necessary, assuming Mrs
Armstrong to be a volunteer, she may well be entitled to succeed as falling
within the second class
in <b>Garcia</b>, on the basis that she did not
understand the purport and effect of the transactions and that no adequate
explanation had been given
to her of their effect and consequences.  However,
in view of my findings in [29] and [30], I do not need to determine whether Mrs
Armstrong would be entitled to relief as falling within the second class in
<b>Garcia.  </b>Likewise, I do not need to determine any of the other bases on
which her claim for relief was made.
<P>

<b>Was Mrs Armstrong a Volunteer?</b>
<P>

32	Whether the matter falls in the first or the second class, it is a
precondition to relief on this basis that the aggrieved wife
be a volunteer.
It was argued on behalf of the Bank that Mrs Armstrong was not a volunteer.
This is said to flow from the fact that
from 1978 she was recorded as the
holder of 25 per cent of the shares in Investments.  It is clear that this fact
does not prevent
her being a volunteer in the case of the Queenscliff mortgage.
That records that it was given in respect of a liability of Investments
and it
was executed before Mrs Armstrong held any shares in Investments.  By the time
of the 1983 transactions it is undisputed that
she did hold shares in
Investments as alleged.  It is argued by the Bank that by this fact alone she
ceases to be a volunteer.  Reliance
is placed upon what was said by McHugh JA
(as his Honour then was) in <b>Warburton v Whiteley</b> (1989) 5 BPR 11,628 at
11,634 where his Honour said:
<P>

"If the evidence had established that Mrs Warburton had a shareholding in the
company sufficiently substantial to warrant a finding
that she had a
shareholding in the company sufficiently substantial to warrant a finding that
she had a beneficial interest in the
company's debt, the prima facie
application of the <b>Yerkey</b> principle would have been displaced:
<b>European Asian of Australia Ltd v Kurland</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%208%20NSWLR%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 8 NSWLR 192.</a>  But I do
not think that Mrs Warburton had any legal onus to tender evidence to show the
nature of the shareholding in the company
to prove affirmatively that she had
no interest in the loan.  If the respondents wished to rely on the nature of
any interest of
Mrs Warburton in the company to defeat her prima facie claim to
a declaration that the guarantee was unenforceable against her, they
bore the
evidentiary onus of establishing the nature of her interest."
<P>

It is submitted on behalf of the Bank that the 25 per cent shareholding is here
undisputed and must on any basis constitute a real
interest in the loan.  It is
said that, whatever is nominal or insubstantial, 25 per cent is "substantial".
The requirement in <b>Garcia </b>[31] is that "the transaction was voluntary
(in the sense that the surety obtained no gain from the contract the
performance of which
was guaranteed)".  At [43] the majority said that the
findings of the trial Judge demonstrated that the appellant in fact obtained
no
real benefit from her entering the transaction" and was consequently a
volunteer.  In this case, in relation to the Queenscliff
mortgage in 1977 it is
not even established what that transaction was.  Nor does Mrs Latham recall the
nature of the transaction
or transactions that led to the execution of
documents (4) and (5) in September 1983, nor is there other evidence of that
transaction
or transactions.  It is not entirely clear, but it may be that the
Tweed Heads mortgage related to the acquisition by Rimenu of a
newsagency.
There is no evidence of an interest of Mrs Armstrong in Rimenu.  The
acknowledgment in 1988 (document (8)), on which
Miss Small is said to have
witnessed the signature, was in connexion with the acquisition by Investments
of a motel at Banora Point
near Tweed Heads.  The 1990 acknowledgment (document
(10)) witnessed by Mrs Conaghan was in connexion with a borrowing to acquire
an
interest in the Salamander Bay Resort, which was the transaction which brought
Mr Armstrong undone.
<P>

33	Although Mrs Armstrong was from 1978 the holder of 25 per cent of the shares
in Investments, there is no evidence of her having
gained anything from any
transaction that was guaranteed.  There is not even any evidence of her having
benefited or gained from
her shareholding in Investments.  That company was, to
use the words of McHugh JA in <b>Warburton,</b> "the 'pup' of her husband".  It
is conceded by the Bank that it was controlled by Mr Armstrong.  Although she
was a shareholder and
director she played no part in its management or running;
she was excluded by her husband from this as from all his other business
affairs.  There is no evidence that any dividend was ever declared by the
company and paid to her.  The only thing she ever received
from the company was
the unit at Tweed Heads, in the sense that it was transferred to her by
Investments.  This was for a consideration
stated in the transfer to be
$104,000.  It is clear she did not pay that sum of money to the company. That
does not mean that the
$104,000 was not paid.  However, the form of the
transaction with the company is not in evidence nor are the company's books of
account
relating to the transaction.  It is no part of the business of
companies to make gifts.  There is no doubt that the transfer was
procured by
Mr Armstrong, on terms dictated by him.  In my view it is not established that
the transfer to her of the Tweed Heads
property was a benefit conferred on her
by Investments (rather than by Mr Armstrong), much less a benefit conferred by
Investments
on her as a shareholder.  The Bank says that it relies upon the
lifestyle which Mrs Armstrong enjoyed and her husband's generosity
in
transferring to her the Queenscliff property, a half share in the Blakehurst
property and the Tweed Heads property; these, it
says, were benefits she
obtained through Investments and which, together with the holding of 25 per
cent of the shares, meant that
she was not a volunteer.  I do not accept these
arguments.  It seems to me that in actual fact it is not demonstrated that she
received
anything from Investments rather than from her husband.  Mrs
Armstrong, when asked how the purchase price of the properties transferred
to
her was paid, replied that her husband "arranged it".  From the evidence I
infer that whatever benefits Mr Armstrong conferred
on her were conferred on
her as a wife and not as a shareholder in or in any way by reference to
Investments.  The shareholding of
25 per cent may not have been insubstantial
or nominal in amount, but was insubstantial or nominal in the sense that Mrs
Armstrong
in fact exercised no rights and received no benefits by reference to
her shareholding (cf <b>Commonwealth Bank of Australia</b> <b>v Khouri
</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/1998/128.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] VSC 128</a> [65]).  The conclusion to which I have come is that Mrs
Armstrong derived no real benefit from the transactions and was a volunteer
in
relation to them.
<P>

<b>Is the Bank Protected by Independent Advice Had by Mrs Armstrong?</b>
<P>

34	It seems to me impossible to argue that the Bank has established that Mrs
Armstrong had had such advice as would protect it against
the consequences of
the exercise of actual undue influence by Mr Armstrong.  I find that it did
not.  She had no advice at all until
August 1989, when the evidence suggests
she received generalised advice relating to her matrimonial problems and the
status of her
property.  In August 1990 she was advised (not, so far as I can
see, in relation to any particular document before the advising solicitor)
that
she should not sign any further documents for her husband.  By this time, she
had already executed documents (1) to (9).  In
relation to document (10), the
advice she had was not in my view of the quality necessary to relieve the Bank
from the consequences
of actual undue influence.  The advice did not relate to
the document she in fact signed, which she had not received when that advice
was taken.  Whatever advice she had, her will was overborne by her husband's
insistence and the threat emanating from his history
of violence.  She executed
the document in mid September 1990 and avoided further violence.  When later in
the month she declined
to execute another document, she was again beaten.
Insofar as it matters, whatever advice she had, I find that the Bank did not
know
of it.  It took no step to ascertain that she had actually had appropriate
advice before she signed.  I find that she did not read
any of the letters
suggesting that she might take advice before signing the acknowledgments.
Insofar as it is alleged in Mr Moran's
statement (and there is some reference
to it in a diary entry of another Bank officer) that Mr Moran in September 1990
in a telephone
conversation suggested that Mrs Armstrong get independent
advice, in the face of Mrs Armstrong's denial of this and Mr Moran's absence,
I
do not accept that this occurred.  In any event, it is not clear from Mr
Moran's statement that the time at which he claims to
have done this was before
the execution of document (10).
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

35	On the findings of fact that I have made, I have come to the conclusion that
Mrs Armstrong's execution of each of the Queenscliff
mortgage, the guarantee,
the Blakehurst mortgage and the Tweed Heads mortgage was procured by the actual
undue influence of Mr Armstrong.
 The same is true of the four acknowledgments.
This is therefore a case in the first class in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b>.
<P>

36	Equally, I have found that Mrs Armstrong was a volunteer in relation to the
above documents.
<P>

37	Whilst the Bank did not know of the particular circumstances in which the
documents were executed, it knew that Mr and Mrs Armstrong
were married.  That,
according to <b>Yerkey v Jones </b>and <b>Garcia, </b>is sufficient.  As Mrs
Armstrong was a volunteer, it was not necessary in order for her to obtain
relief that the Bank should have
notice of any unconscionable dealing between
them.  If more were needed, there were additional factors in this case.  The
Bank gave
the documents to Mr Armstrong to go and obtain his wife's signature,
or in the case of the acknowledgments, posted them to the Armstrongs'
matrimonial home.  Mr Armstrong was well known to officers of the Bank, both at
the branch and in the person of Barry Moran, the
Regional Manager.  Mr
Armstrong's forthright, impatient and forceful personality must have been
apparent to those who dealt with
him.  That there were troubles within the
marriage was conveyed to Mr Moran in the presence of his wife by Mrs Armstrong
in 1989.

38	It was not demonstrated that Mrs Armstrong had adequate independent advice
which operated to relieve the Bank of the consequences
of Mr Armstrong's undue
influence, or that she had had relief from the ascendancy of her husband.
<P>

39	I conclude that the guarantee and the Queenscliff mortgage, the Blakehurst
mortgage and the Tweed Heads mortgage ought be set
aside and that the
acknowledgments do not assist the Bank.  In those circumstances the Bank's
cross claim against Mrs Armstrong will
fail.  Draft minutes should be brought
in accordingly at a time I shall appoint.  Any question as to the extent or
form the appropriate
orders and as to costs can be argued at the time the draft
minutes are brought in.
