<P>


<P>

1	<b>ADAMS J:  </b>On 30 July 1997 a landslide below the Alpine Way at Thredbo
caused the deaths of eighteen persons.  An inquest into the manner and
cause of
those deaths commenced in the Coroner's Court of New South Wales on 10 August
1998.  The plaintiff is the mother of one
of the dead victims of the landslide.
The second defendant is a geologist who was employed by the New South Wales
Road and Traffic
Authority and its predecessor, the Department of Main Roads,
since 1986.  His responsibilities included planning and execution of
a range of
geo-technical work including, in particular, work in relation to the Alpine Way
from 1991 to 1996.  He attended at the
site of the landslide in the early
morning of the following day and inspected the site and undertook certain
supervisory responsibilities
connected with the rescue operation.  The second
defendant provided a statement to the inquest almost exclusively confined to
his
involvement in this operation.  Also provided to the inquest were a number
of reports by the second defendant prepared in the course
of his duties
covering the period from 1991 and 1996 relating, inter alia, to the stability
of the Alpine Way in the vicinity of
the landslide.
<P>

2	On 16 March 1999, the second defendant was called before the inquest to give
evidence but, relying on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</i> 1980</a> (the 1980 Act),
declined to answer any questions on the ground that the answers might tend to
incriminate him.  The coroner upheld
the objection and stood the defendant
down.  In doing so, the coroner observed that any question which was relevant
to the inquiry
was probably incriminating whilst an irrelevant question would
not be permitted.  Although, in general, the objection should be taken
to each
question as it is asked to enable the court to determine whether it be
appropriately taken, the course of action adopted
by the coroner in the
circumstances of his inquest was not inappropriate having regard to the nature
of coronial inquiries, which
are investigative, without parties and are not
bound to follow the rules of procedure and evidence applicable in a court of
law;
 the plaintiff in this court does not submit to the contrary.  On 18 March
1999, Mr Green QC, counsel for the families of fifteen
of the eighteen victims,
submitted to the Coroner that he should apply the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> (the Act), give a certificate under subsection 128(3)
and require the second defendant to give the evidence which he had earlier
declined to do.  The coroner rejected this submission saying, in substance,
that he was not entirely convinced that the Act applied
to proceedings in a
coroner's court and that, even if it did, he would decline to exercise his
discretion to give a certificate,
presumably upon the ground that he was not
satisfied that "the interests of justice require that the witness give the
evidence" 
(s 128(5)).
<P>

3	The plaintiff seeks from this court a declaration that the Act applies to the
coroner's court so that a certificate may be given
to the second defendant in
accordance with s 128 and requiring him to give evidence.  The second defendant
opposes the granting of
the declaration sought upon two grounds :  firstly, the
Act does not apply to coronial proceedings;  and, secondly, even if the Act
did
apply, the exercise of the Coroner's discretion was not shown to have erred.

<P>

4	Section 4(1) of the Act provides that its provisions apply "in relation to
all proceedings in a New South Wales Court".  The relevant
definition in the
Act's dictionary is - 
<P>

	<b>NSW Court</b> means:  
<P>

	(a)	the Supreme Court, or 
<P>

	(b)	any other court created by Parliament,
<P>

	(including such a court exercising federal jurisdiction) and includes any
person or body (other than a court) that, in exercising
a function under the
law of the State is required to apply the laws of evidence.
<P>

5	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</i> 1980</a> provides as follows -
<P>

	33.  A coroner holding an inquest or inquiry shall not be bound to observe the
rules of procedure and evidence applicable to proceedings
before a court of
law, but no witness shall be compelled to answer any question which criminates
the witness, or tends to criminate
the witness, of any felony, misdemeanour or
offence.
<P>

It follows that if a coronial inquest is not conducted by a court, the Act does
not apply to it since a coroner is not required
to apply the laws of evidence.
It was not contended otherwise by Mr Green QC for the plaintiff.  The crucial
question is whether
a coroner's court is "created by Parliament" within the
meaning of paragraph (b) of the definition of "NSW Court".
<P>

6	If the matter were ever the subject of serious controversy, there has been
for some time no doubt that a coroner's court is a
court of record, not only
because the coroner is required to take and file depositions (s 34 of the 1980
Act) and record his or her
findings (s 22) and has the power to punish for
contempt (s 43) but "also by force of its early history and powers":
<i>Attorney General v Mirror Newspapers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 NSWLR 374</a> at 381, 386;
<i>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited v Gill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20NSWLR%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) NSWLR 77</a> at 80-1.
<P>

7	The question before me, however, is not so much whether a coroner's court is
a court as that term is used in the definition in
the Act but whether it is a
court <i>created by Parliament.</i>  The <i>Coroners Act</i> 1898 consolidated
the whole or parts of eight earlier statutes, being described as "an Act to
consolidate the enactments relating
to Coroners' Inquests, and to Magisterial
Inquiries into the cause of death".  That Act proceeded upon the assumption
that the office
of coroner was otherwise established and in form and substance
regulates certain aspects of inquest procedure and the powers and
duties of
coroners.  In no sense could it be suggested that that Act created a coroner's
court.  
<P>

8	Ensuing legislation amended the procedures and expanded the powers of
coroners leading to a further consolidation by the <i>Coroners Act</i> 1912.
One of the Acts repealed by the 1912 statute was the <i>Coroners Court Act</i>
1904 but the substance of this latter Act was simply to provide that coroners
were to conduct all "inquisitions" without a jury except
in particular cases,
and expressly provided that this tribunal (to use a neutral term) was in every
other respect unchanged as to
its character and powers.  The 1912 Act was, as I
have mentioned, a consolidation and did not effect any material change to the
office
or functions of the Coroner.  
<P>

9	As was pointed out by Kirby P (as he then was) in <i>Attorney General v
Maksimovich</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 300</a> at 305, the office of coroner was
established in New South Wales by Letters Patent in 1787.  The <i>Coroners
Act</i> 1960, inter alia, repealed the 1912 Act and otherwise regulated and to
some degree expanded the powers of coroners but, again, it
did not establish
the office of coroner let alone create a court.  It self-evidently applied to
an existing institution.  One significant
change introduced by the 1960 Act was
to relieve coroners of the responsibility of holding inquests or inquiries as
to the cause
of death of a person or the cause of a fire where a person had
been charged with an indictable offence involving the issue of the
cause of
death or of the fire and, in the case where the inquest or inquiry was
commenced and evidence given established in the opinion
of the coroner that
there was a prima facie case against a person for an indictable offence in
which whether such a person caused
the relevant death or fire was in issue,
then the proceedings were to be immediately adjourned and the papers forwarded
to the Attorney
General awaiting the outcome of any other appropriate criminal
proceedings.  In <i>Bilbao v Farquhar &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 528</a> the
purpose of these changes was explained as follows (by Moffitt P at 535) -
<P>

	It will be seen that s 28(1) protects a person, in respect of whom committal
proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i>, 1902 are pending, from exposure to
publicity from evidence which might be given in the course of a coronial
inquest, but would not
be received in the course of committal proceedings, and
from publicity from the findings of the coroner or coroner's jury.  It will
also be seen that, where no such committal proceedings are pending, so that the
step has not been taken to pay a charge of the type
in question, no protection
is provided against the possibility of a charge later being laid and the
coronial inquest continues until
the evidence "has been taken".  It is then
only that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(2)</a> intervenes to protect the person possibly to be charged by
the decision of the Attorney-General.  The protection given is only from
the
publicity of the finding of the coroner or the jury.  If the coroner then forms
a view of the evidence which might result in
the Attorney-General so deciding,
then <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(2)</a> intervenes to prevent the coroner taking the usual course of
announcing his finding or taking the finding of the jury.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 28(2)(ii)</a>
provides that in the circumstances he shall:  ". . . forward to the Attorney
General the depositions taken at the inquest, inquiry
or magisterial inquiry
together with a statement signed by the coroner, justice or justices setting
forth the name of the person
against whom a prima facie case for an indictable
offence has, in his or their opinion, been established and particulars of such
offence, . . ."
<P>

Section 29 of the 1960 Act required the findings to be made in writing but
prohibited any indication or suggestion that any person
was guilty of any
indictable offence.
<P>

9	Part II of the 1960 Act provided for the appointment of coroners.  Their
jurisdiction is described in the following terms -
<P>

	6.	Every coroner, whether or not he is appointed to be a coroner in and for
the State of New South Wales, and every deputy coroner,
shall have and may
exercise, subject to the provisions of this Act, jurisdiction throughout the
State of New South Wales.
<P>

	8.	Every stipendiary magistrate shall, by virtue of his office, have the
jurisdiction, powers and duties of a coroner throughout
the State of New South
Wales.
<P>

10	Part III of the Act concerned the jurisdiction of coroners in respect of
inquests and inquiries and provided that in the specified
circumstances the
coroner "shall have jurisdiction" to hold an inquest (s 11(1)) or an inquiry (s
12(1)).  
<P>

11	It is not necessary for me, because of the repeal in 1980 of this Act, to
consider whether the provisions of Part II and Part
III of the Act amounted to
the creation of a coroner's court, but I am inclined to think that they did
not.  Rather there is an adoption
of the jurisdiction hitherto exercised by
coroners (Part II) and a variation of jurisdiction (Part III).
<P>

12	The 1980 Act, which, inter alia, repealed the 1960 Act seems to me to have
brought about a significant change.  Part 2 of the
1980 Act again provided for
the appointment of coroners but stated his or her powers in very different
language -
<P>

	8.	A coroner appointed under this Act, irrespective of whether he is appointed
to be a coroner at a specified place in and for
this State, has all the
jurisdiction, powers or duties <i>conferred</i> <i>or imposed on coroners by or
under this Act.  </i>(Emphasis mine)
<P>

	10.	A stipendiary magistrate has, by virtue of his office, all the
jurisdiction, powers and duties <i>conferred or imposed on coroners by or under
this or under any other Act.  </i>(Emphasis mine)
<P>

Part 3 of the Act is in relevantly similar terms to the 1960 Act.
<P>

13	The <i>Coroners Amendment Act</i> 1988 created the offices of State Coroner
and Deputy State Coroner with extensive supervisory functions in connection
with coronial
services in New South Wales.  In 1993 certain deaths must be the
subject of inquests and must be heard by the State or Deputy State
Coroner.
<P>

14	I am of the view that, if there were any residual common law jurisdiction
possessed by coroners, the enactment of the 1980 Act
had the effect of
excluding it and giving to coroners an exclusively statutory jurisdiction, in
other words, that ss 8 and 10 should
be read as meaning that the coroners have
the jurisdiction etc conferred by this Act and no others.  This is not to say
that the
Act constitutes a code so far as coronial law and practice are
concerned:  see <i>Maksimovich v Walsh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20NSWLR%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 NSWLR 656</a> at 662.  However,
any other powers that he or she might have than those specifically granted in
the Act must, as it seems to me,
be incidental to them and not independent of
them.  Even so, the coroner's court, as such, is an institution of considerable
antiquity,
and existed in New South Wales from an early time.  A coroner was
described as "a judge of a court of record" by the then Chief Justice
in 1968
(<i>Chippett v Thompson</i> 7 SCR at 355).  If it was intended to abolish the
court and reconstitute it (which I doubt) ss 8 and 10 of the 1980 Act were not
apt to do so.
<P>

15	It was submitted by Mr Green QC that the coroner's court was a creature of
statute.  This may be so, but I do not think that
such a metaphor is a useful
mode of approaching the correct interpretation of "created by Parliament" in
the definition of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a>.  It may well be that,
especially having regard to the provisions which I have mentioned in the 1980
Act, the jurisdiction of the
coroner's court has been so adjusted and regulated
by the legislature that its ancient jurisdiction has either been adopted by
Parliament
or erased.  However, considered at its simplest, the submission that
the 1980 Act terminated the Court's previous jurisdiction and
substituted a new
jurisdiction which depended upon the statute although in many respects it was
otherwise indistinguishable from
the previous jurisdiction, is persuasive.
Whether, however, the replacement of a mixed common law and statutory
jurisdiction with
a new statutory jurisdiction with the same or very similar
attributes amounts to the creation of a new court in ordinary parlance
is
uncertain.  Moreover, this question cannot be determined for present purposes
in the abstract since, crucially, the issue is whether
such a court is "created
by Parliament" within the meaning of the definition of "NSW Court" in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a>.
<P>

16	The process of reasoning which I have outlined demonstrates that,
essentially, the plaintiff's contention involves a judgment
as to the degree to
which legislation affects the congeries of jurisdictional attributes of the
coroner's court so that, at the end,
a conclusion can be derived as to whether
the process has reached the stage that it may be concluded that tje court in
its present
condition has been "created by Parliament".  Such a conclusion
requires detailed consideration of the history, and a judgment of
the degree of
adoption or replacement of the earlier non-legislative elements, of the
institution.  I do not think, however, that
the requirement in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></i> that a New South Wales court be "created by Parliament" was intended to
refer to courts apt to fit that description only by the process
of tortuous,
subtle and perhaps uncertain reasoning of the kind which the plaintiff's
submissions require.  That is to say, I consider
that the phrase "created by
Parliament" means "created by Parliament <i>as such</i>" so that it is rather a
formal definition than a descriptive one.  If this be correct, it is clear from
the legislation to which
I have referred that the coroner's court is not
created by Parliament in the sense of the definition.
<P>

17	Even if the conclusion stated above be incorrect, I do not consider that the
termination of the prior jurisdiction of the coroner's
court by the 1980 Act
and its replacement involves the creation of a new court.  Whilst the
substitutionary process is undoubtedly
very significant, its demonstration does
not conclude the matter.  On balance, I am of the view that the characteristic
jurisdiction
of the coroner's court was essentially continued although those
functions which earlier depended upon the common law (and it may
have been that
most of them did) were adopted by the statute and given Parliamentary
authority.  However, I think that the court
as an institution of public justice
continued and its legislative history did not lead to the creation of a court
by Parliament.
<P>

18	It is worthy of note, I think, in this context that the then Attorney
General and Minister of Justice in his second reading speech
on the <i>Coroners
Bill</i> 1980 was entirely unconscious of the possible implications of the
substituted jurisdiction since his speech omits all mention of
it.  The
legislation flowed, in part, from a report of the New South Wales Law Reform
Commission which stated -
<P>

<i>	</i>Over the past fifteen years the [Coroners] Act [1960] has, for the
greater part, served its purpose well.  In some respects, it has
been found a
model worthy of adoption elsewhere.  We are concerned here only with some
blemishes and anomalies, rectification of
which will add to its utility.  
<P>

This was evidently the view shared by the Minister.  
<P>

19	Of course, the existence of the coroner's court since the early days of the
colony was notorious, as was its anomalous though
obviously useful
jurisdiction.  The origin and history of the office of coroner are helpfully
summarised in Waller, <i>Coronial Law and Practice in New South Wales</i>, 3rd
ed (1994) pp 1-2.  
<P>

20	In <i>Mirror Newspapers Limited v Waller</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1985%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1985 1 NSWLR 1</a>, Hunt J (as he
then was) adverted to the nature of the jurisdiction of the coroner,
contrasting it with that of an ordinary court
(at 16) -
<P>

	The other section of the <i>Coroners Act</i> to which I referred in this
context was s 33, which provides that the coroner is not bound to observe the
rules of procedure and
evidence applicable to proceedings before a court of
law.  The need for such a departure from the rules of procedure is obvious,
because an inquest or an inquiry does not have parties, and there are no
pleadings, charges or indictments which define the issue
to be tried.  Although
usually there are legal representatives for the interested parties, the coroner
must consider the interests
not only of those parties but also of other persons
as well.  It is often left to the coroner himself to maintain a vigilant eye
upon the relevance of evidence, and objections to the evidence are not always
readily apparent.  The absence of defined issues is
of paramount importance in
relation to this question.  Their absence necessarily requires the adoption of
different procedures to
those applicable to proceedings before the ordinary
courts of law.
<P>

	At least one of the coroner's functions, in particular, would make an
observance of the usual rules of procedure and evidence an
impossibility.  I
refer to the coroner's residual investigatory function.  Historically, the
coroner investigated all cases of sudden
death.  He did so because his duties
originally were fiscal in nature, and the unnatural death of a citizen could
produce revenue
to the Crown.  According to the Statute De Officio Coronatoris,
of 1276, the coroner was obliged to determine where such a person
was slain,
who was present and who was guilty.  Since the establishment of a regular
police force, this investigatory function of
the coroner has been largely, but
not entirely, superseded.  According to a report of the Chief Justice's Law
Reform Committee, submitted
in 1964 (and published as Appendix B to the
<i>Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Coroners Act</i>, 1960 (LRC 22
1975) a coroner's inquest is still used as an aid to the police, in order to
afford to them an opportunity of furthering
their investigations by the
examination and perhaps cross-examination of witnesses under oath (par 3 at
88).  That was the nature
of the inquiry which the coroner was conducting in
the present case in the "preliminary part" of the inquest into the death of Mrs
Watson, and which was the subject of the prohibition order pursuant to s
44(1).
<P>

21	Considerations such as those mentioned by his Honour demonstrate
convincingly that a scheme of evidence such as that provided
by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act </i>1995</a> would be inappropriately imposed on a coroner's court.  Indeed, it
was never intended to override any other legislative scheme. 
Section 8 of the
Act makes this clear by specifically providing, "This Act does not affect the
operation of the provisions of any
other Act.
<P>

22	I have set out above the provisions of s 33 of the 1980 Act, the effect of
which is thus expressly preserved.  It would be surprising
if, of the
provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a>, the only one required to be applied
in the coroner's court were <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128.</a>  In one sense, of course, s 128 of the Act
is not inconsistent with s 33 of the 1980 Act since, if a certificate were
capable of
being given under s 128, it would mean that the evidence would no
longer tend to incriminate the witness and accordingly s 33 could
be complied
with even if the witness were required to answer the relevant question.
However, I consider that the better view of s
33 is that it is in substance
inconsistent with the procedure for giving certificates set out in s 128 of the
Act.  Accordingly,
s 8 of the Act has the effect of rendering s 128
inapplicable to coroner's courts at all events.
<P>

23	It was not disputed that the objection by the second defendant was well
taken but as this matter was not elaborated I do not
think it necessary or
desirable to say more about it than that there seems to have been a proper,
though somewhat slight, basis for
accepting the propriety of the objection.
Having regard to the way in which the matter was argued before me I think I
should observe
that I do not see any error in the manner in which the coroner
determined that, on the assumption that he had the jurisdiction to
apply s 128
of the Act, he would decline to give a certificate.  In this regard the
consideration referred to in <i>R v Coroner;</i>  <i>ex parte Alexander</i>
1980 [VR] 731 at 738 provides a further ground for the coroner's exercising the
discretion to decline a certificate.
<P>

24	Accordingly, the declarations sought must be refused.  By consent, no order
as to costs with liberty to apply.
