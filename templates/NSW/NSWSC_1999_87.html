<P>

	<b>JUDGMENT (Application for Directions as to Presentation of Case to
Jury)</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff sues in respect of two telecasts by the defendant, the first on
13 March 1995 ("<i>Today Tonight</i>"), the subject of the Third Further
Amended Statement of Claim and the second, that of 7 May 1996
("<i>Witness"</i>), the subject of the Second Further Amended Statement of
Claim.
<P>

2	By reason of the dates of publication <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i>
applies to these proceedings.
<P>

3	The defendant seeks directions as set out in the letter dated 16 February
1999 delivered at my request.  The directions sought
are as follows:
<P>

	<i>"1.	That the matter complained of in each action be considered and
determined separately and consecutively by the jury.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	That in each action the videotape comprising the matter complained of be
played once only to the jury.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	That the videotapes to be played to the jury shall include the material
played during the commercial breaks and the time periods
defining the
commercial breaks.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	That in each action the jury not be informed of the imputations until
the jury has seen and heard the matter complained of (in
this regard, the jury
can be informed that the plaintiff claims damages for defamation arising from
the publication).</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	That no part of the video containing the matter complained of is to be
played during addresses.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	That the jury will not be supplied with transcripts of the matters
complained of".</i>
<P>

4	Directions are also sought on the order of addresses by counsel and the
confining of the contents of the opening address by counsel
for the plaintiff.

<P>

5	I will approach the matters on the basis that the directions are of the kind
envisaged by SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p26" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 26</a> r 1 and SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p34" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 34</a> r 6.
<P>

6	It is to be noted that I ruled on another structure of trial (adversely to
the defendant) on 4 February 1999 (DLJT: 1).
<P>

7	The amendments to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i> provide for the jury to
determine only whether the relevant publication carries the imputations pleaded
by the plaintiff and whether
they are defamatory.
<P>

8	The foundation for the present application for the directions lies, it is
said, in a series of dicta of the Court of Appeal relating
to publications said
to be "<i>transient</i>" in their nature, namely radio and television
broadcasts.  Allied to this consideration and stressed during the course of
submissions
was the notion of the "<i>impression</i>" such a "<i>transient</i>"
publication makes upon the viewer and listener.
<P>

9	In <b><i>Gordon v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited &amp;
Anor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 410</a> Hunt J was concerned with questions of pleading
and the form of a Statement of Claim involving a television broadcast.
Particularly
was his Honour concerned with the inclusion in the pleading of
every passage which materially alters of qualifies the complexion
of the
imputation complained of (see paragraph 6 of his Honour's judgment, that format
then applying to reports in the New South
Wales Law Reports).  His Honour goes
on to say in paragraph (7):
<P>

	<i>"Particularly in the case of radio and television publications, a plaintiff
is entitled to submit to the jury that the reasonable
listener or viewer, as
the case may be, although deemed to have listened to the whole of what was
broadcast, nevertheless, may not
have devoted the same degree of concentration
to it as he would have to a written document: Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB
Pty
Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 418</a> (n) at 420. In the case where there is a written
document, of course, it is possible for the reader to consider or reread the
whole
document at leisure.</i>
<P>

<i>	(8)  Each case will, no doubt, depend upon its own circumstances, but it is
easy to imagine a viewer missing the significance of
a qualification or
contradiction at the beginning or (perhaps less likely) at the end of a segment
such as that complained of here.
On the other hand, it is difficult to accept
the existence of the reasonable listener or viewer who failed to comprehend a
refutation
in the sentence following that in which the charge was made or whose
concentration selectively increased in relation to random passages
between
those which materially qualified the effect of those he comprehended.</i>
<P>

<i>	(9)  Notwithstanding the lack of unqualified application of that principle
in the case of oral defamation, the rule remains that
the capacity of the
matter complained of to convey particular defamatory imputations of and
concerning the plaintiff must be judged
by what the ordinary reasonable viewer
or listener of average intelligence would have understood from the broadcast as
a whole. This
is made clear by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Morosi v
Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 418</a> (n) at 419</i>"<i> </i>(at
413).
<P>

10	His Honour thus refers to the first of the series of judgments of the Court
of Appeal referred to by Mr Wheelhouse in the course
of his submissions.
<P>

11	An extract of the judgment of Samuels JA is reported as a note to
<b><i>Gordons </i></b>case (at 418).  <b><i>Morosi's</i></b> case was a
"<i>bane and antidote</i> case". Reliance was placed upon certain observations
of Samuels JA in the context of an attack made upon the summing up in the trial
of that action.  At 402B (paragraph (9)) his Honour said:  "<i>But I do not
think that any purpose is really served by a scrupulous analysis of what was
said.  It is more a matter of impression
taking into account the attributes of
the notional listener</i>".  That listener as his Honour had said earlier at
419(5) is the "<i>ordinary reasonable listener of average intelligence (who is
the relevant stereotype), considering the broadcast as a whole (which
is the
correct criteria), ..."</i>  
<P>

12	It was in<b><i> Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Limited v Parker </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29
NSWLR 448</a> that the first important reference was made to the desirability (in
pre-1995 actions), of the jury determining the issue of whether
or not
imputations are conveyed at the commencement of the trial.  In the course of
discussing the admissibility of the transcript
of the relevant radio broadcast,
Clarke JA made some "<i>observations</i>" on this subject.  At 473C his Honour
said:  
<P>

	<i>"... it seems to me that there is much to be said for the view that where a
plaintiff relies on the natural and ordinary meaning of
the published words the
questions whether the words convey the imputations pleaded and, if so, whether
they are defamatory should
be submitted to and decided by the jury prior to the
leading of any further evidence. After all separate trials of the capacity of
the material to support the imputations occur regularly and there is, of
course, no evidence of the factual material surrounding
the publication led
during those trials. </i><cite>If this course were to be adopted then, as it
seems to me, counsel for the plaintiff would open the case, the broadcast would
be played,
both counsel would put their contentions in address, the judge would
sum-up and the jury would retire to consider the two questions</cite><i>. If
the jury decided in the plaintiff's favour then the plaintiff's case on damages
and the defendant's case on the various defences
could proceed in the normal
manner" </i>(emphasis added).
<P>

13	Handley JA agreed with Clarke JA in the following terms (at 474A-E):  
<P>

	<i>"In my opinion it is particularly important in a case such as this for the
jury to determine at the start of the trial, and before
other evidence has been
called, whether the imputations pleaded were conveyed by the broadcast and were
defamatory of the plaintiff.
I agree with Clarke JA that where as in this case
no issue of identification arises and the plaintiff only relies upon the
natural
and ordinary meaning of the words a written transcript of the broadcast
is not admissible on these threshold issues.  Moreover none
of the oral
evidence given in this case over twelve hearing days or any of the voluminous
documentary evidence was admissible on
these issues either. This evidence gave
the jury far more information about the nature of the dispute in the NRMA and
the plaintiff's
role in it than was available to the ordinary reasonable
listener who heard the six minute broadcast. </i><cite>In my view by the end of
this trial it was impossible for the jury to place itself in thought in the
position of the ordinary reasonable
listener who only heard this broadcast once
without being aware of any of this background knowledge</cite><i>. It would not
be realistic to expect that a jury could put this body of evidence out of its
mind and concentrate solely and simply
on the actual broadcast itself.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whether the broadcast conveyed the pleaded imputations and whether they
were defamatory of the plaintiff are correctly said to be
questions of
impression. The jury had to decide whether the ordinary reasonable listener who
heard the broadcast, who did not hear
it again and who had no special knowledge
of the dispute would have understood, on the basis of this material alone, that
the plaintiff
had been defamed in one or more of the ways pleaded in the
statement of claim. </i><cite>Since these are questions of impression the
procedures at the trial must be moulded to enable the jury to decide them as
matters of
impression</cite><i>. It seems to me that to ask the jury to decide
those questions at the end of a twenty-six day trial and after consideration of
extensive
oral and written evidence practically guaranteed that they would not
be decided according to law" </i>(emphasis added).
<P>

14	Particular reliance is placed on the observations of Handley JA and
emphasised above, particularly in relation to "<i>matters of
impression".</i>
<P>

15	<b><i>TCN Channel 9 Pty Limited &amp; Ors v Mahony</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR
397</a> was an application for leave to appeal against a decision of Sully J to
refusing an application in the course of the defamation trial
for separation
determination by the jury of the questions whether the words conveyed the
pleaded imputations and whether they were
defamatory.  The Court held that
there was power to so order.  At 400-1 Kirby P said after referring to the
observations of Clarke
JA in <b><i>Parker</i></b>:
<P>

	<i>"The point that concerned Clarke JA (and which I believe is of legitimate
concern) was that a broadcast (whether by radio or television)
is typically
heard once only. Unlike the print media, the texts of broadcasts are not
usually available to be pored over. They are
momentary, transitory things.
Whether words and images contained in such broadcasts actually convey the
imputations pleaded, and
whether such imputations are defamatory of the
particular plaintiff, depend upon the impression received by the viewer or the
listener.
It is to distort that initial impact, to comb through transcripts
(which the ordinary viewer or listener would never have) and to
spend day upon
day of a lengthy defamation trial returning over and over again to the words,
repeating the reviewing or listening
to and examining the written text. The
danger in this procedure, inherent in the orthodox approach to defamation
trials,</i><cite> is that it may become impossible for the jury to recapture
the initial impression, which is the equivalent of the impression which
the
ordinary viewer and listener received and for which, if at all, the person
defamed is entitled to damages</cite><i>"</i> (emphasis added)".
<P>

16	His Honour went on to remark that the procedural step advanced by Clarke JA
was a "<i>natural and logical step</i>" in the process of determining the
validity of the plaintiff's claim.  His Honour made the point that if
determined unfavourably
to the plaintiff it would terminate the trial there and
then and would save a lengthy hearing and costs both to the litigants and
public and save also Court time.  His Honour goes on to say (401C):
<P>

	<i>"Arguably, it would also be more just, for it would avoid contamination of
the primary issue of the defamation proceedings by the
numerous other issues
relevant to defences and damages necessarily covered in a full trial.
</i><cite>Above all, it would preserve the integrity of the trial by requiring
that the primary question be decided upon initial impressions
(as would be the
case of the ordinary viewer or listener)</cite><i> rather than by extended
re-examination and repeated viewing and listening to the offending program (not
ordinarily available to the
viewing and listening public)" </i>(emphasis
added).
<P>

17	It is to be borne in mind that in both <b><i>Parker</i></b> and
<b><i>Mahony</i></b> the concern in the making of the observations as to the
desirability of the jury determining the question of fact as to the imputations
at the beginning of the trial was excited by the savings in time and cost to
which I have referred and, in the context of a pre-1995
action, the elimination
of the risk of infection of the jury's process on that issue by references to
the matter complained of or
parts thereof that arise in the litigation of other
issues before the end of the trial.  It is argued by Mr Wheelhouse, in support
of the direction that the jury not be informed of the imputations until the
jury has seen the matter complained of, that informing
them of the imputations
is capable of colouring the jury's understanding.  The jury having been
informed of the imputations in advance
would then view the program searching
for those meanings.  Mr Wheelhouse paraphrased an extract from the judgment of
Clarke JA at
472-473) as follows:  <i>"In this respect the transient nature of
the broadcast and its short duration is of no little relevance.  Indeed, I have
earlier expressed
the opinion that </i><cite>the imputations may well have
coloured the jury's understanding</cite><i> of what was said in the broadcast
..." </i>(<i>scil</i> "the evidentiary material").  The "<i>matter of
impression" </i>was further referred to by Kirby P at 405F as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Whilst as a matter of discretion, consideration could be given, properly,
to the conventional mode of trial and the advantages to
the plaintiff of that
mode, if the judge decided to follow the course suggested in Radio 2UE, there
would be no impediment of power
or jurisdiction upon doing so. The very length
of defamation proceedings, the advent of the fleeting images of radio and
television
as a new factor in the just ordering of such proceedings and the
need to ensure </i><cite>that the initial impression is preserved</cite><i>,
and not lost in the saga of a lengthy trial, all provide reasons why the power
should exist and should sometimes be exercised in
favour of granting the
application" </i>(emphasis added).
<P>

18	The 1994 amendments to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i> affecting post-1
January 1995 publications, of course, have eliminated that consideration of the
jury being "<i>infected</i>" by subsequent evidence in the course of which
references may be made to the matter complained of before the time comes at
which
the jury is called upon to decide the threshold matter.  There is no
question, now, that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> functions of the jury should be performed at the
commencement of the trial (following <b><i>Parker</i></b> and
<b><i>Mahony,</i></b> in <b><i>RZ Mines (Newcastle) Pty Limited &amp; Anor v
Newcastle Newspapers Pty Limited &amp; Anor</i></b> (unreported, 16 November
1994), Hunt CJ at CL, obviously in a pre-1995 action, made an order under SCR
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 2 for the separate determination by the jury in that case of the
question of whether the imputations were conveyed and were defamatory
and,
because it was relevant, made observations as to the limitation on counsel's
opening address (see page 5).
<P>

19	In <b><i>Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden</i></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 158</a> Hunt CJ at CL most usefully reviews relevant principles
relating to the test to be applied to determine whether or not a matter
complained
of is capable as a matter of law of carrying an imputation and the
directions and considerations that would be incorporated in a
summing up to a
jury for the purpose of its determination of whether in fact defamatory
imputations are conveyed.  His Honour's review
commences at 164B.  After
reviewing these principles including the principle that the mode or manner of
publication is a material
matter in determining what imputation is capable of
being conveyed, his Honour says at 165G to 166D: 
<P>

	<i>"All of these considerations, and more, apply to matter published in a
transient form -- and particularly in the electronic media.
Whereas the reader
of the written document has the opportunity to consider or to re-read the whole
document at leisure, to check
back on something which has gone before to see
whether his or her recollection of it is correct, and in doing so to change the
first
impression of what message was being conveyed, the ordinary reasonable
listener or viewer has no such opportunity: Gorton v Australian
Broadcasting
Corporation  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20ACTR%206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 ACTR 6</a> at 11; Brown v Australian Broadcasting Corporation
(Hunt J, 4 May 1987, unreported) at 11. Although such a listener or viewer
(like
the reader of the written article) must be assumed to have heard and/or
seen the whole of the relevant programme, he or she may not
have devoted the
same degree of concentration (particularly, I would say, where it is the radio)
to each part of the programme as
would otherwise have been given to the written
article (Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 418(n)</a> at
420), and may have missed the significance of the existence, earlier in the
programme, of a qualification of a statement made
later in the published
material: Gordon v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 410</a>
at 413.</i>
<P>

<i>	The trial judge in a transient publication case will therefore more readily
leave it to the jury to decide whether an imputation
affected by any of those
circumstances, or any similar circumstances peculiar to such type of
publication, was in fact conveyed,
than he or she would in relation to a
written document case: Brown v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (at
12-13)".</i>
<P>

20	It is to be noted that his Honour was discussing questions of
"<i>capacity</i>".
<P>

21	None of the cases to which Mr Wheelhouse referred, in my respectful view,
constitutes binding authority prescribing the "<i>procedure</i>" that would
eventuate from the directions sought.  The position of the defendant is that
the making of the directions, in the light
of the developing emphasis on the
transient nature of a television program and the "<i>matter of impression</i>"
inevitably compels such a course to be taken to preserve the <i>"initial
impression</i>" it being critical it is said to "<i>the plaintiff's claim for
damages".</i>  The provision of the imputations to the jury before that body
views the program would "<i>infect</i>" the integrity of the initial impression
on the jury.
<P>

22	The course suggested for the defendant is, in effect, <i>"unheard of"</i>
and deconstructs the orthodoxy attendant upon the usual procedure in defamation
actions on the issue of whether or not the matter
complained of conveys the
imputations (as I have said, the danger of <i>"infection</i>"<i> </i>of the
jury in its function in this regard by repeated references to the matter
complained of in evidence on other issues has been
eliminated by the amendments
to the legislation).
<P>

23	Notwithstanding that the position of the defendant in seeking these
directions can be so characterised, the question is whether
or not as a matter
of principle and thus of practice, whether it is available.
<P>

24	Upon the enunciation by Mr Wheelhouse of the fundamental proposition for the
defendant to which I have adverted above, there
was thrown up a question of
"<i>evidence</i>".  It is the position of the defendant that the
"<i>evidence</i>" the jury will have placed before it will be constituted only
by the transmission "<i>across the courtroom</i>" of the electronic visual
images and audio sounds which happen to be stored on the videotape.  The
videotape itself is merely the
mechanism of storage and reproduction of the
<i>"real evidence</i>" constituted by the electronic transmission to which I
have referred.  It is thus argued to the point that the videotape itself would
not be admitted into evidence as evidence (and an exhibit) but merely marked
for identification.  That which the defendant asserts
to be the
"<i>evidence</i>" (the visual images and sounds) by its very nature exists
"<i>transiently</i>" and, I suppose, cannot be "<i>marked</i>".  It is seen and
it is gone (in the courtroom), just as it is seen and it is gone in the lounge
room.  I was referred by Mr Wheelhouse
to the judgment of the High Court in
<b><i>Butera v Director of Public Prosecution, Victoria</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR
180</a> which concerned the admissibility of a transcript of a tape recording of a
conversation in a foreign language (and its translation
into English).  The
passage particularly relied upon in the judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan and Deane
JJ is as follows:
<P>

	<i>"What is a transcript of a tape recording? It is a document setting out
words which can be heard on playing over the tape. It is not
a copy of the
tape, but a written record of what has been heard. Prima facie, the issue
whether the recorded conversation took place
should be proved by playing the
tape in court if it be available, not by tendering evidence, whether written or
oral, of what a witness
heard when the tape was played over out of court. That
is the consideration which weighed with Street CJ in Conwell v Tapfield  
23
[1981] 1 NSWLR, at p 598. when he said: </i>
<P>

<i>	`What is the best evidence of the sounds entrapped in the record? It seems
to me that there can be only one answer to this question,
namely, the best
evidence is the reproduction of those sounds as sounds when the record is
played by appropriate sound reproducing
equipment. Much of the confusion that
has crept into the cases stems from the fact that normally it is the human
voice that is recorded
and, when reproduced, this is commonly done in writing.
But if, say, the relevant evidence was a screech of tyres before a collision
and that had been recorded, there would be no denying that the best method of
placing this evidence before the court would be by
playing the record. There is
not the slightest difference in basic principle where the recorded sound is the
human voice'.</i>
<P>

<i>	That view is clearly right, and its cogency is strengthened rather than
weakened by the invocation of the traditional term "best
evidence". That is not
to say that the tape is itself the admissible     evidence of what is recorded
on it. A tape is not by itself
an admissible object for by itself it is
incapable of proving what is recorded on it: it is admissible only because it
is capable
of being used to prove what is recorded on it by being played over.
By using sound reproduction equipment to play over the tape,
the court obtains
evidence of the conversation or other sound which is to be proved; it is that
evidence, aurally received, which
is admissible to prove the relevant fact</i>"
(at 185-6).
<P>

25	Mr Wheelhouse's proposition conforms with what I understand their honours to
be saying in the last two sentences of the extracted
passage.
<P>

26	I feel that this "<i>problem</i>", if it really be a problem, in a practical
sense is overcome by practical considerations reinforced by the definition of
"<i>document</i>" in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i>Dictionary and the videotape would
be admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of that legislation.  What the current application is
really about is the use to be made of the material contained on the videotape.
If the practical approach is not adopted there is strictly no <i>"record</i>"
of the evidence presented to the jury.  The jury in any event is directed
(irrespective of the use to which the videotape has been
put) that the
publication which they have to consider <i>is</i> constituted by the visual
images and sounds.
<P>

27	In response to the proposition advanced for the defendant in support of the
directions sought, what I will describe as "<i>considerations</i>" were raised
by counsel for the plaintiff.  I so describe them as, to a very great extent,
they beg the question posed.
<P>

28	First:  the making of the direction sought will bring about an unprecedented
and unjustifiable interference with the conduct
of counsel in his address to a
jury under the adversarial system.  If counsel engages in this conduct, the
sanction is the discharge
of the jury with consequential orders for costs.
This consideration, stated in very general terms, is one I consider to be
correct
and I will not expand upon it.
<P>

29	Secondly, in a jury trial the jury has the exhibits in the jury room.  This
is said to be clear from s 55A of the <i>Jury Act</i> which provides:  "<i>A
judge ... may refuse to allow an exhibit at the trial... being left with the
jurors after they have retired if satisfied that the
exhibit or the safety or
the jurors would be put at risk"</i>.
<P>

30	The limitations otherwise are those founded on practicalities and common
sense (see <b><i>Kozul v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%2d1981%29%20147%20CLR%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980-1981) 147 CLR 221</a> at 235 per
Steven J).  In this context generally it is interesting to note that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, <i>1995</i> in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54</a> (Views to be evidence)<i> </i>now
provides:  <i>"The Court (including if there is a jury, the jury) may draw any
reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices
during a
demonstration, experiment or inspection</i>".
<P>

31	I turn now to the plaintiff's answer to the essence of the defendant's
contention.
<P>

32	There are essentially three components:  first: the validity of the
distinction between "<i>transient</i>" publications and publications of other
kinds, for example, in newspapers or books.  Very shortly stated the contention
for the plaintiff
is if the matter of "<i>initial impression</i>" is available
in relation to the "<i>transient</i>" publications, on what basis in principle
should the same not apply to the book or the newspaper?  The <i>"mere
opportunity</i>" in the last cases for the reader to go back and which is
referred to by Hunt CJ at CL in the extracted portion from
<b><i>Marsden</i></b> above, it is argued, as I understand it, not a sufficient
basis for the distinction.  I am inclined to agree however.  I do not consider
it necessary to resolve this first component of the plaintiff's response.  
<P>

33	The second component is made up of the jury's function in a defamation
action.  The phrase "<i>determining whether the matter published is
defamatory"</i> is misleading:  in fact it is wrong in terms of the function of
the jury.  The function of the jury is to determine whether on the
balance of
probabilities the matter complained of carries the imputations pleaded by the
plaintiff and whether they are defamatory
(the defamatory imputations).  What
the jury determines is whether or not the plaintiff has proved his causes of
action <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 9</a> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a>).  </i>This role and function of the jury
is of critical importance when considering concepts such as <i>"transience</i>"
and "<i>initial impression</i>".
<P>

34	This second component is inexorably linked with the third and that is that
it must ever be borne in mind that the jury's decision
is an objective one.
The jury does not decide whether it, that is, its four members, are of the view
that the matter complained of
carries the defamatory imputations.  The jury
decides whether the hypothetical ordinary reasonable viewer would understand
the matter
to carry those defamatory imputations.  It is in this area that
particular care must be taken in using expressions such as <i>"initial
impression</i>" in the way advanced for the defendant.  There is a risk of
thinking in terms of the "<i>initial impression</i>" the program makes on the
jury as determinative of whether or not the hypothetical <i>"ordinary
reasonable viewer" </i>would understand the publication as carrying the
defamatory meanings. 
<P>

35	When therefore one considers the function of the jury, duly constituted as a
judicial body as a component of the administration
of justice in these actions,
and the test to be applied by them (an objective one) and the directions the
jury receives as to both,
the foundation for the defendant's position, in my
view, falls away.  
<P>

36	There is the further intrusion of what might described as an
"<i>unreality</i>" namely, the artificial structure of the cause of action
itself, that is, the imputation.  The person sitting in the lounge room
looking
at the television, if that person gives any thought to what a program
"<i>means</i>", realistically does not think of it in terms of the
artificiality of the causes of action constituted by imputations.  The law does
not require that environment to be reproduced in the courtroom by reason of the
task to be performed by the jury (determining defamatory
imputations) and the
test by which they do so(an objective one).
<P>

37	As long as the test is objective and the function of the jury is to
determine on the balance of probabilities whether or not
the causes of action
have been established (the defamatory imputations) there is great danger, in my
view, in an undue concern with
notions of "<i>initial impression</i>" or
indeed, "<i>transient publications"</i>.  The danger is that the "<i>initial
impression</i>" will be understood as that made on the jury as ordinary
reasonable viewers diverting them from the hypothetical viewer and <u>that</u>
viewer's attributes.  The safeguard to both parties is the function the jury
performs, the objective approach and the directions
it is given as to how it
goes about both.
<P>

38	I do not find that the observations upon which reliance was placed by Mr
Wheelhouse in the several judgments in the Court of
Appeal and the cases
referred to inevitably or logically can lead to the conclusions advanced.
<P>

39	I am of the view that a jury will not be diverted from or infected in, its
process of applying the objective test in determining
whether the causes of
action have been established by knowing in advance what those causes of action
are or by seeing the videotape
more than once.  The use that counsel make of
the videotape during the course of addresses contains the seeds of available
sanctions:
 one of which obviously will be to the effect that the more the
plaintiff has to play the videotape, the less likely, it would be
argued
forensically, that the ordinary reasonable viewer would understanding it as
carrying the defamatory imputations.  Another
sanction, of course, is the
discharge of the jury in the event of counsel's behaviour warranting it or in
the extreme case, as is
referred to by the learned editors of <i>Ritchie</i> in
paragraph 34.61A of impropriety or incompetence becoming manifest, or the
placing of fictious or collusive material or propositions
before the jury.
<P>

40	The defendant's application raises a novel point.  Its disposition has been
affected by the need for speedy determination in
circumstances where it would
have been desirable that the luxury of further time might expose, in more
detail, the process of reasoning
to the conclusions to which I have come.  I
say this in the light of the decision handed down by the Court of Appeal at
10.15am on
18 February 1999 and the discussion as to further management it
provoked.  At this moment, once again, the emphasis is striving to
have the
jury empanelled.
<P>

41	Thus, I will decline to give the direction sought in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and
5 of the letter dated 16 February 1999.
<P>

42	In relation to the direction sought in paragraph 1 (separate and consecutive
jury consideration) I will decline to make that
order.  The impracticalities
are obvious;  the unnecessary time wasting and expense are obvious.  Juries
hitherto in defamation actions
have been called upon to decide whether multiple
publications are defamatory in the requisite sense individually.  In criminal
cases
every day of the week juries are directed as to the necessity in multiple
count trials of considering each count separately and the
evidence in relation
thereto separately.  The same applies in a defamation action.  I do not
consider that there will exist any risk
in the jury being sent out to consider
both programs (as opposed to each program separately and consecutively), such
risk being,
it was submitted, of consideration of the first program infecting
the consideration of the second.  Thus, I decline to give the directions
sought
in paragraph 1.
<P>

43	As to paragraph 6 of the letter relating to the jury being supplied with
transcripts, it is agreed between the parties as I understand
it from
submissions on 17 February that the plaintiff will not require transcript.  I
think that is a very sensible approach.
<P>

44	There remains outstanding the matter of "<i>order of addresses</i>" in
respect of which I have yet to hear full argument.
<P>

45	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

	That I decline to give the directions in paragraphs 1 to 5 referred to in the
letter of Mallesons Stephen Jaques dated 16 February
1999.
<P>
