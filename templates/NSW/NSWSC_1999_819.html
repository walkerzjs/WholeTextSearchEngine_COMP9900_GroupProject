<b>5095/97 &amp; 4088/97 - GREGORY ALFRED WILDE &amp; ANOR  V MATTHEW THOMAS
ANSTEE &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is a vendor and purchaser matter in which I
handed down reasons for judgment on 23 June 1999.  I decided that
the
plaintiffs, the vendors, had validly terminated the contract for the sale of
their property and that they were entitled to an
order that the second
defendant (the real estate agent) pay them the deposit which it held together
with interest which the deposit
had earned.  In my opinion the plaintiffs were
also entitled to recover damages for breach of contract.  I said (at paragraph
70
of my reasons for judgment) that since no evidence was led for the purpose
of quantifying the plaintiffs' damages, I proposed to
make an order for the
assessment of damages by the Master.
<P>

2  	The first defendant, the purchaser, had a cross-claim in the
proceedings in which he sought a declaration that he was entitled
to the return
of the deposit plus interest, and an order that the real estate agent pay him
the deposit and interest.  In the alternative,
he sought an order under s 55 of
the Conveyancing Act for repayment of the deposit, with or without interest.
He also claimed damages
for breach of contract.  It followed from the reasoning
which I set out in my written reasons for judgment of 23 June 1999 that in
my
opinion the first defendant was not contractually entitled to the return of the
deposit and interest, nor to an award of damages
for breach of contract.  In
paragraph 70 I said that the cross-claim should be dismissed, thereby implying
(though I did not expressly
deal with the matter) that the first defendant's
alternative claim under s 55 had not succeeded.
<P>

3  	Now there are three further issues to deal with, namely whether
my reasons for judgment contain a `slip' which should be corrected;
 the form
of the orders which are to be made;  and the question of costs.
<P>

<b>Correction of a `slip' in reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

4  	Shortly after I handed down my reasons for judgment, counsel for
the first defendant contacted my associate to say that there
is a `slip' in the
judgment.  I therefore arranged for the matter to be listed before me in order
to deal with this claim.  It emerged
at a hearing on 27 July 1999 that there
appeared to be differences in the recollection of counsel for the parties as to
what had
occurred at the primary hearing relevantly to the alleged slip, and
differences between the recollection of counsel for the first
defendant and my
own recollection.  
<P>

5  	It is common ground that at the hearing of the case on 19 October
1998 neither party addressed the claim under s 55 in opening
the case or in
submissions.  Counsel for the first defendant said that this was because the
hearing on 19 October 1998 was limited
to questions concerning the
interpretation and effect of the contract for sale and the notices given
pursuant to it, and was conducted
on the basis that his application for relief
under s 55 would be heard subsequently if he were unsuccessful on the
contractual questions.
 He said that my mistake was to purport to deal with the
matter which had been reserved for subsequent determination, and that I
should
correct the mistake by making orders which would keep alive the application for
relief under s 55.
<P>

6  	On the basis that the first defendant had orally moved, in
effect, for re-opening of the hearing on the ground of the alleged
slip and
there was a question of fact to be resolved as to whether an issue had been
reserved for separate determination, I directed
on 27 July 1999 that the
parties put on affidavits with respect to that matter.  However, this has not
occurred and instead, by a
letter to my associate dated 6 August 1999 the first
defendant's solicitors have informed the Court that they `have been instructed
to withdraw their client's application pursuant to the Slip Rule'.  Even so, it
appears to me that I should set out the position
as I see it in these reasons
for judgment.  If there were a mistake in my reasons for judgment of 23 June
1999 I could correct it
of my own motion at this stage.  Since orders have not
yet been made, I could proceed under Part 40 Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules
rather than being confined to Part 20 Rule 10.  I have concluded, however, that
there is no proper basis for concluding that any
mistake has been made.
<P>

7  	This case was brought forward for hearing out of the short
matters list.  Originally there had been two proceedings, as I explained
in
paragraphs 5 and 6 of my reasons for judgment of 23 June 1999, but they were
consolidated in 1997, so that what had been a claim
by the first defendant for
relief by summons became a cross-claim within consolidated proceedings.  The
consolidated proceedings
were placed in the short matters list and were brought
forward out of that list for hearing by me on 19 October 1998.  The court's
file does not indicate that any arrangement was made, prior to the allocation
of the hearing date for the consolidated proceedings,
for the proceedings to be
split in the manner which the first defendant has subsequently claimed.  No
application was made at any
stage for the determination of a separate question
under Part 31.  
<P>

8  	At the hearing on 19 October 1998 counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr
Smith, opened and then adduced the plaintiffs' evidence, comprising
affidavits
and the tender of a bundle of documents.  Then counsel for the first defendant,
Mr Burchett, opened his client's case,
and adduced evidence, which also
comprised the reading of affidavits and the tender of documents.  There was no
oral evidence on
either side.  The parties then proceeded to submissions,
identifying some difficult and unresolved points of law, which are dealt
with
in my reasons for judgment of 23 June 1999.
<P>

9  	The transcript of the hearing is uninformative.  In accordance
with usual practice in this Division, the court reporter did
not transcribe the
openings and submissions, and so the transcript merely records the adducing of
documentary evidence and my rulings
on admissibility.
<P>

10  	According to my notes, during his opening Mr Smith said `hearing
today on liability - no question of quantum'.  <i> </i>I inferred from that
observation, as my reasons for judgment of 23 June 1999 make plain, that if the
plaintiffs were to succeed in
establishing an entitlement to damages, as they
did, a further hearing would be required for the assessment of damages.
According
to my notes, when Mr Burchett opened for the first defendant he
handed up a chronology and immediately moved into dealing with the
facts and
issues.  My notes show that when he began his submissions, Mr Burchett handed
up a written outline, which is in the court
file.  The written outline makes no
reference to the s 55 claim.  However, according to my notes Mr Burchett said
something at the
end of his submissions which I summarised thus:  `relief -
declaration as to entitlement to deposit subject to any relief under
Conveyancing
Act;  and declaration as to validity of notice to terminate the
agreement'.  I did not at the time or subsequently interpret this
as anything
more than a submission to the effect that my determination of contractual
entitlement would be subject to the court's
statutory power to deal with
entitlement to the deposit under the Conveyancing Act;  but no further
submission was made as to whether
or why I should exercise the statutory
power.
<P>

11  	There is no other indication in my notes that the alternative
claim to relief under the Conveyancing Act had been put aside
for separate
determination after my determination of the contractual entitlement of the
parties.  I have no independent recollection
of being informed of any such
arrangement.  I believe that I would have made a note of such a matter because
it would affect the
scope of the issues for determination in my judgment, and I
have made no such note.  Had any application been made to me for a deferred
determination of the s 55 issue, I expect I would have been very reluctant to
accede to the application, especially having regard
to the comparatively small
amount of the deposit and the escalation of legal costs which would have been
entailed.  In the circumstances,
my assumption at all relevant times has been,
since there was no submission with respect to s 55 nor any evidence
particularly directed
towards relief under that section, that it was a claim to
relief which the first defendant had decided not to press at the hearing.
 
<P>

12  	Since the first defendant has withdrawn his application and no
affidavit evidence has been filed pursuant to my earlier directions,
there is
no obstacle to my proceeding to make orders to give effect to the reasons for
judgment of 23 June 1999.  The application
having been withdrawn, there is no
occasion for me to decide whether, in a case where the recollections of the
judge and the legal
representatives of a party are at variance as to whether a
question has been informally reserved for later consideration, the wise
course
may be to allow a further hearing on that issue.
<P>

<b>Form of orders</b>
<P>

13  	I propose to make declarations that the second notice to
complete and the notice of rescission were valid and effective, that
the first
defendant breached the contract and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the
deposit and the proceeds of investment of the
deposit.  Counsel for the first
defendant invited me to use the expression `proceeds of investment' rather than
`interest' in order
to allow for the deduction of any costs of making the
investment, and the plaintiffs' solicitor has agreed that this wording is
appropriate.
 I propose to order the second defendant to pay over the deposit
and investment proceeds to the plaintiffs, and to make an order
that the Master
inquire into whether, and if so what recoverable damage or loss has been
suffered by the plaintiff, and for the first
defendant to pay the plaintiffs'
damages, if any, in the amount assessed by the Master.
<P>

14  	Counsel for the first defendant urged me to qualify the order
for payment of damages by limiting it to the amount (if any)
of damage or loss
which exceeds the value of the deposit and the proceeds of investment of the
deposit.  The plaintiffs' solicitor
submitted that I should not limit the
assessment of damages in this way, since his clients wish to contend that in
the circumstances
of this case, their recovery of damages should not be reduced
by the amount of the deposit (and its investment proceeds) which will
be
forfeited to them.  Since it was not practicable to deal with the plaintiffs'
contention at the brief hearing of the matter this
morning, I decided that the
proper course was to leave all aspects of the question whether the plaintiffs
have suffered damage or
loss, and if so the recoverable amount, to the Master's
determination.  The Master will be in a position to hear and determine the
question whether the plaintiffs' loss is a net figure calculated after making
allowance for the deposit and investment proceeds.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

15  	I have decided to order that the first defendant pay the
plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings to date.  The order will not
extend to the
costs of the hearing before the Master, which must be dealt with separately at
the time.  Nor will my order affect
a costs order which has already been made
on an unsuccessful motion by the plaintiffs for summary judgment.  However, the
order will
extend to the plaintiffs' costs of both Supreme Court proceedings
before they were consolidated, and also the District Court proceedings
before
they were transferred to this Court.
<P>

16  	Counsel for the first defendant submitted that I should not
order his client to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the District Court
proceedings, because the District Court had no jurisdiction to grant the relief
which the plaintiff sought in those proceedings.
 In their District Court
Statement of Claim issued on 14 May 1997, the plaintiffs sought damages,
interest and costs, and also an
order:
<P>

`That the sum of $44,500.00 held by the second defendant representing the five
percent deposit paid under the Contract together
with all interest thereon be
paid to the plaintiffs'.  
<P>

17  	Counsel for the first defendant referred to an exchange of
correspondence between the solicitors for the parties, in which
the plaintiffs'
solicitors said, in their letter dated 7 August 1997 replying to a request for
particulars, that their clients' right
to such an order arose from the terms of
the contract between the parties and the first defendant's failure to complete,
and that
the source of jurisdiction to make the order was the equitable
jurisdiction of the District Court.  Counsel for the first defendant
says there
is no relevant equitable jurisdiction.  
<P>

18  	It is not necessary for me to decide whether the District Court
would have had jurisdiction to deal with the proceedings which
the plaintiffs
instituted in that court, in order to determine whether the order for costs in
favour of the plaintiffs should extend
to the costs of the District Court
proceedings.  It is enough for me to conclude that the plaintiffs behaved
reasonably commencing
proceedings in that court.  In my opinion there was at
the very least a plausible argument for the view that the District Court had
ample jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  
<P>

19  	I have held that in the present case the contract for sale
between the plaintiffs and the first defendant was terminated under
clause 9.2,
which entitles the vendor to recover the deposit and sue for damages.  What the
plaintiffs sought (apart from damages)
was an order for the payment of an
amount of money by way of recovery of the deposit consequent upon the valid
termination of the
contract.  It is plausible to say that an order of this kind
is in substance an order for the payment of a liquidated amount due
and payable
under a contract, arising in a personal action at law.  On that basis, the
District Court had jurisdiction to deal with
the proceedings under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(1)(a)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act 1973</a> (NSW), which at the time of commencement of the
District Court proceedings in May 1997 provided as follows:
<P>

`44(1) Subject to this Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of
the following actions:
<P>

(a)	any personal action at law in which the amount claimed does not exceed
$250,000, whether on a balance of account or after an
admitted set-off or
otherwise.'
<P>

20  	There being a plausible basis for contending that the District
Court had jurisdiction, because the proceedings were a personal
action at law,
my view is that the plaintiffs were not deprived of their costs simply because
their solicitors, in answering a request
for particulars, referred in general
terms to the equitable jurisdiction of the District Court.
<P>

21  	The first defendant says that the District Court was deprived of
any jurisdiction it might otherwise have had by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(2).</a>  At the time of
commencement of the District Court proceedings, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(2)</a> stated, subject to
subsection (3), that the District Court did not have jurisdiction in an action
in which title to land the value
of which was more than $250,000 was in
question.  The first defendant says that the District Court proceedings raised
an issue as
to whether the contract of sale of between the plaintiffs and first
defendant had been validly terminated.  That, in turn, raised
an issue about
title to land, because the purchaser under a contract for the sale of land has
an equitable interest in the land which
is extinguished by the valid
termination of the contract.  Since the value of the land in this case was
clearly more than $250,000,
the first defendant says that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(2)</a> deprived the
District Court of jurisdiction.
<P>

22  	In my opinion, the short answer to this submission is that by
the time the District Court proceedings were commenced, the plaintiffs
had
resold the land to the knowledge of the first defendant and there was no longer
any basis upon which the first defendant could
claim an equitable interest in
the land.  But if that were not so, the argument would fail because of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(3).</a>
Under that provision the District Court has the power to decide a claim where
the title to land the value of which is more than $250,000
incidentally comes
into question in an action.  In this case the action is for the recovery of the
deposit and damages, and any question
as to the extinguishment of the equitable
interest of the purchaser (if such an interest can properly be described as
`title to land'
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48)</a> comes into question incidentally to
the action for recovery of the deposit:  <i>Ex parte McEvoy </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281868%29%208%20SCR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1868) 8 SCR
16</a>;  cf <i>Smith v Pattison</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2051%20WN%20137" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934) 51 WN 137.</a>  At the very least, there are
plausible grounds for contending that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(2)</a> does not apply to the present
case.
<P>

23  	There being plausible ground for doing so, it was reasonable for
the plaintiffs to commence proceedings in the District Court
rather than the
Supreme Court, having regard to the relatively small amount of deposit which
was sought to be recovered.  The District
Court proceedings were transferred to
this Court.  Those proceedings have been transferred to this Court on the basis
of the pleadings
in the District Court, and have been continued here and then
consolidated with the proceedings commenced by the first defendant.
 The
plaintiffs have succeeded in the consolidated proceedings and in my opinion,
since costs should follow the event, it is appropriate
that the plaintiffs
should recover their costs of the District Court proceedings as well as the
Supreme Court proceedings initiated
by the first defendant, the Supreme Court
proceedings for transfer of the District Court proceedings, and the eventual
consolidated
proceedings.
