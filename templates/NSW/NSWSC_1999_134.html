11670/90	<b>MILTON HATZIGEORGIOU AND ELIAS HATZIGEORGIOU, EXECUTORS IN THE
ESTATE OF THE LATE CON HATZIGEORGIOU   v   WARWICK BAKER</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In proceedings commenced in 1990 the late Con Hatzigeorgiou (to
whom I shall refer in this judgment as "the deceased")
sued Warwick Baker.
During his lifetime the deceased engaged the services of the defendant as his
solicitor, and the defendant acted
for him for some twelve years up until
November 1989.  Central to the cause now before this Court is the allegation
that the defendant
failed to exercise due care in the discharge of his
professional responsibilities towards the deceased.
<P>

2	When he began these proceedings the deceased was unrepresented.  Apparently
he prepared the statement of claim which was filed
and this document was
plainly defective in many respects.  Following the death of the deceased on 3
November 1993, the plaintiffs
Elias Hatzigeorgiou and Milton Hatzigeorgiou
assumed the conduct of the cause as plaintiffs.  The statement of claim, even
in its
amended form, is defective and it contains no assertion to this effect,
but presumably the claim has been pursued by the plaintiffs
as executors of the
estate of the deceased and pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1944404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act</a></i>, 1944.  No point was taken by the defendant as to the form
of the pleading before this Court and the hearing proceeded upon the basis
I
have indicated.
<P>

3	The amended statement of claim filed by the solicitors for the executors
recast the allegations of negligence to be relied upon
and when the hearing
began Mr Howen of counsel, for the plaintiffs, presented yet further amended
particulars of negligence and these
were the focus of the trial as it
proceeded.
<P>

	<b>The deceased sustains injury at work</b>
<P>

4	As at 8 August 1977 the deceased was employed as an apprentice panel beater
by Nickolas Koumandakis and Nickolasi Petrou, trading
as KNP Smash Repairs
("the employers").  On that date the deceased sustained burn injuries at the
employers' panel beating shop after
paint thinners were spilt on him and his
clothing was ignited with a cigarette lighter.  The injuries were serious and
the deceased
was admitted to hospital.  The employers invited the deceased to
complete a claim form for workers' compensation benefits which contained
a
false account as to the circumstances in which the burns had been sustained.
It appears that the employers were concerned that
the true account of those
circumstances may have lead their workers' compensation insurer to decline
liability under the statutory
form of policy which they had.  The employers'
report of injury (Exhibit 2) contained the following description of injury:
<P>

	<i>"The injured was welding under a car, he had a bit of paint on his overalls
from the previous day, that probably caused the hole [sic]
fire."</i>
<P>

5	The true position, as eventually found by Allen J, was that <i>"what was
intended by all concerned to be no more than harmless horseplay"</i> occurred,
during the course of which the contents of a bucket that included paint
thinners was tipped on the deceased and afterwards
one of the employers lit his
cigarette lighter near the deceased's clothing.  The clothing then ignited.
<P>

6	The deceased was admitted to hospital for treatment and remained there for
approximately six weeks.
<P>

	<b>The deceased consults the defendant</b>
<P>

7	The defendant gave evidence as to the circumstances in which he was
instructed, as to the advice he gave the deceased, and as
to the instructions
of the deceased.  Whilst the plaintiffs were not able to challenge the
defendant's evidence on those matters
by direct evidence, Mr Howen submitted
that I should not accept the defendant's account as to those matters and indeed
generally,
particularly where there was absent any file note or written advice
of a confirmatory nature.
<P>

8	The defendant was in the witness box for best part of four days and in that
period he was subjected to very searching cross examination.
 Throughout this
experience the defendant conducted himself with calm and dignity.  I was
impressed with him as a witness and I formed
the assessment not only that he
was an honest witness but that he was essentially a reliable one.
<P>

9	I accept as reliable the defendant's account as to the advice he gave to the
deceased and as to the instructions the deceased
gave him.  I shall proceed to
summarise the defendant's evidence as it bears upon those matters.
<P>

10	The defendant was first approached about the deceased's work injury by the
latter's then de facto wife.  There is no need to
dwell on that meeting but
subsequently the defendant saw the deceased for the first time in his office in
York Street in September
1977.  The deceased told the defendant that he had
been burned at work by having thinners spilled on him and that the thinners
were
then set alight.  The deceased explained there had been some skylarking
going on.  The deceased handed the defendant an insurance
form, presumably that
to which I have already referred.  The deceased said that was not the way the
accident had happened and the
defendant advised the deceased not to submit a
claim form with the wrong version.  The defendant advised the deceased he would
have
a claim either for workers' compensation benefits or for damages and the
deceased told the defendant that he had not been paid by
his employers since
the date of injury.  The defendant advised the deceased to fill in a Legal Aid
claim form.
<P>

11	The claim form was duly obtained and the defendant met the deceased in his
office once again.  On this occasion the defendant
said the deceased gave him a
more detailed explanation as to the circumstances in which he had been injured
and the defendant said
that he gave the deceased advice as follows:
<P>

	<i>"I said to him it sounded as though he might have a damages claim against
Koumandakis personally, but that it didn't sound like an
ordinary workers'
compensation claim because it sounded to me more like an assault with intention
that he be set on fire.  I said
it also sounded as though it was the sort of
activity that might not be covered by an ordinary workers' compensation policy
because
there was not only skylarking going on, but it seemed to be to me that
the activity that had been going on might have been outside
the normal work
situation or outside the sort of work activities that might have been covered
by the employer's policy.  I said we'd
have to make a lot more inquiries but
we'd have to take statements from all the witnesses we could lay hands on.  I
suggested to
him that we ought to make a workers' compensation claim for his
lost income to test the water to see what sort of a reaction we got
when the
claim was brought against the insurer, and shortly, during the course of that
discussion he spoke to me about some plans
that he had and that he said he was
looking to go back to work.  That's all that was said at that stage about
employment.  And I
then said, `Well, give me some instructions to bring a
workers' compensation claim and we'll see what that produces.'  He gave me
instructions to bring a workers' compensation claim."</i>
<P>

12	There was a later meeting just before the defendant filed an Application for
Determination in the Workers' Compensation Commission.
 At that meeting the
deceased informed the defendant that he had a position at La Parisienne
restaurant and that he was earning more
than he would have been in his
pre-injury employment.  Hence the Application for Determination was for a
closed period only.
<P>

13	Then early in 1978 the defendant described a long conference with the
deceased in which he gave advice as follows:
<P>

	<i>"... I told him that workers' compensation was a mean system because people
who were injured at work generally only got weekly workers'
compensation and
they didn't get any more than that.  That the system was designed to give them
weekly compensation to replace wages
when they couldn't work or to give them a
top up if they were able to, if they were earning less than they had been
formerly.  It
didn't give them at that stage anything in the nature of a large
sum at one go for injuries they'd suffered or for wounds and burns
that he had
suffered.  I told him that it depended.  He had to be injured in the course of
his job to get that benefit and that he
had to be disabled or incapacitated at
that stage, but he had to be unable to work or to be partly unable to work in
order to get
weekly compensation payments.</i>
<P>

<i>	I told him that we had seen, by that stage we had spoken to a large number
of witnesses.  We had a much clearer idea of what had
happened than in our
earlier meetings.  That I thought the situation was very risky for him at that
stage because it was still fairly
clear that his remedies were against his
employers personally as opposed to the employers' insurer and my recollection
is that I
told him that we'd already had some sort of hint from some source
that the workers' compensation insurer wasn't going to pay his
wages.  He asked
me about getting a large sum of money and I said to him that that came from
proceedings in either the Supreme Court
or the District Court and I said that
was damages and that that in turn was very dangerous and that's where I
started, that's where
I said to him, `Look, litigation or starting case claims
in the District Court or the Supreme Court is a bit like getting on a tiger.
Once you get on it's very difficult to get off without being bitten.'  Now, I
explained to him, I said to him that common law damages
would give him large
compensation for his injuries and that he wouldn't get any lump sum
compensation through the workers' compensation
system.  I said he ought to be
very careful before he started anything in common law because you shouldn't
start common law proceedings
unless you are fairly confident that there was an
insurance company going to pick up the tab.  And at that stage I was very
unconfident
that there was any chance of the insurer being a party to any claim
in the District Court or the Supreme Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you tell him why you held that view?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, because I explained to him that it was the same, likely to be the
same insurer that he sued as in the Workers' Compensation
Commission but that
was under a different hat.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And did you then proceed to say anything to him about why the insurance
company might not have to pay?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I said to him that from the way he and others had described the way he
was burned it seemed to me then that his employer had
stepped outside the
insurance policy that was going to provide cover for his injuries.  I also
talked about the attempted fraud and
that the impact that that might have on
the insurance company's response to the claim for compensation and possibly
also if he brought
a claim for damages.  I told him at that stage that both of
those situations were unclear in outcome for him because of what we'd
heard
from - my recollection is now it was from the solicitors for the insurer.  At
that stage I suggested that he didn't start common
law proceedings and that we
should run the workers' compensation proceedings just to see what the result
was.  He asked me more about
the workers' compensation and I said to him at
that stage that - Oh, at that stage I think he told me that he was running the
possibility
of having to go, have more surgery for skin rafts.  He told me that
somewhat earlier in the meeting, that meeting or the earlier
meeting, that when
that happened the advice I gave to him was that what I saw in workers'
compensation was possibly a string of individual
claims for short term periods
of compensation whether it was total or partial because he was then back at
work and that I expected
that if his claim was against either the workers'
compensation insurer or his employers ultimately, if they weren't covered by
the
policy, that there'd be an argument about paying his compensation or at
least an argument was possible when he put a claim in.  I
said it all depended
very much on how he, what sort of recovery he made and whether his injuries
became stable.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Was there any discussion either emanating from you or him inquiring as
to the relationship between benefits under the workers'
compensation
legislation and any remedies in common law proceedings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.  I sought to explain the difference between the two.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Could you tell us as best you can what you said please?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I said something along the lines that workers' compensation gave weekly
benefits and paid his medical bills for treatment, but
that it was different
from damages in the District Court or the Supreme Court because that gave you
an one off settlement and that
it compensated you or gave you lost wages both
in the past and in the future and it gave you compensation on one occasion for
the
injury you'd suffered, pain and suffering and that also that once you got a
judgment in the District Court or the Supreme Court that
was an end to your
workers' compensation.  You couldn't go back after you got the judgment because
it stood in place of your workers'
compensation entitlement.  I also told him
about the principle of not being able to have more than one bite of the cherry
and that's
when I told him about, that if social security benefits you received
if you had them while you were waiting for your judgment.  You
had to pay back
your medical bills and you had to pay back any workers' compensation you'd
received before the judgment was handed
down."</i>
<P>

14	According to the defendant, the deceased rejected the prospect of making a
succession of claims in the Workers' Compensation
Commission and said:
<P>

	<i>"'I don't want to have anything more to do with the two Nicks.  The less I
come into contact with them or have anything at all to
do with them, the
better.  I don't want to be involved with them in making claims for weekly
compensation from time to time if I
am not well or something very similar to
that.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did he elaborate on that at all?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Not that I can recall.  He spoke about the common law
possibility.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Yes.  Could you tell us what he said please?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  He said, `I want my compensation all in one go.  I don't want to be - I
don't want to come backwards and forwards.'"</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The proceedings in the Workers' Compensation Commission</b>
<P>

15	On the return date in the Workers' Compensation Commission when the
application first became before the Commission in June 1978,
the proceedings
were adjourned until September of that year.  By that time the employers had
filed no answer but the insurer was
represented on the adjourned date, having
declined liability under the policy.  The proceedings were further adjourned to
enable
the employers to obtain legal advice because of their potential personal
liability to the deceased.
<P>

16	On this September 1978 date there was a further discussion about the
deceased's workers' compensation rights in which the deceased,
the defendant
and Mr Neale of counsel, who was then appearing for the deceased, participated.
The defendant said that he explained
to the deceased, or Mr Neale did, that the
deceased had a compensation claim <i>"that looked as though he would have a
remedy for a long time, if not forever, in the Compensation Court if he was
ever disabled again"</i>.  However it was further explained that the present
claim was a closed period claim.  The deceased responded to this advice in
words
to this effect:  <i>"I am not really interested in these short claims in
this court."</i>.
<P>

17	Eventually the claim in the Workers' Compensation Commission was heard by
the then Chairman, Judge Langsworth QC, and resulted
in an award in the
deceased's favour on 14 February 1979.  That award was for a closed period from
8 August 1977 until 31 October
1977.  The insurer resisted payment but the
defendant made representations to the Commission and eventually the insurer
satisfied
the award.
<P>

18	However it does not appear that in doing so the insurer made any admission
and the proceedings before the Workers' Compensation
Commission left open the
issue as to the insurer's obligation to indemnify the employers in respect of
future claims presented by
the deceased and in particular in relation to the
claim he embarked upon at common law.
<P>

	<b>The proceedings against the employers at common law</b>
<P>

19	The defendant gave advice to the deceased about his prospects at common law
in words to the following effect:  
<P>

	<i>"I think you will win in a claim against your employers, but because of the
way your injuries occurred you may not get anything from
the insurance company.
You may have to go against your employers themselves.  We don't know whether
they have the money to pay him
or not."</i>
<P>

20	In giving instructions to proceed at common law the deceased said to the
defendant:  <i>"I want a lump sum."</i>
<P>

21	So it was that counsel was briefed to draw a statement of claim which was
filed in the Supreme Court on 5 May 1978.  The deceased
in the statement of
claim pleaded his case against the defendants in negligence and he also sued
the first defendant, Koumandakis,
in assault since that defendant allegedly
ignited his clothing.  Each of the defendants was apparently separately
represented and
the workers' compensation insurer was joined as a cross
defendant.  That insurer denied any liability to indemnify the defendants.
<P>

22	A trial in these proceedings did not take place until 1989, some eleven
years after the statement of claim was filed, and it
is necessary to trace the
history of these proceedings in some detail.
<P>

23	The defendant failed to appear at several directions hearings in 1980 and
1981 but his evidence satisfies me that this led to
no appreciable delay,
because he was not in a position to take a date for trial at the time of those
directions hearings.  This was
because the deceased had not given him the
particulars of earnings necessary to permit of the preparation of proper
particulars under
Practice Note 19.  (The deceased had a large number of
employers after the end of 1977.)
<P>

24	Eventually a hearing date was fixed for 9 June 1982 and the matter was
prepared for trial.  Senior counsel briefed in the matter
returned his brief
shortly before the trial date and senior counsel who replaced him advised that
the deceased's wife, from whom
the deceased was by then estranged, was an
essential witness.  Mrs Hatzigeorgiou was not available because of her then
advanced state
of pregnancy and on the plaintiff's application the trial date
was vacated.  The terms upon which the date was vacated were that
the deceased
could seek a new date on two days notice, and it was the defendant's
understanding, expressed in this Court, that a
trial date approximately two
months thereafter could have been allocated.
<P>

25	Senior counsel in advising of the need to call Mrs Hatzigeorgiou also
advised of the need for expert evidence concerning the
paint thinners and the
quantity that had burnt the skivvy the deceased had been wearing at the time of
the fire.  This contemplated
expert evidence called for scientific examination
of the remnants of the cotton skivvy.  To qualify an appropriate expert took an
extraordinary time, and it was not until 4 February 1986 that the expert's
report became available.
<P>

26	Even then the defendant did not seek a hearing date, and it was not until
December 1987 that he filed a notice to set down for
hearing and fresh <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1944404/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 33</a>
particulars.  In filing the notice at this time the defendant overlooked the
order that had been made in June 1982 which would have
permitted him to apply
for a hearing date on two days notice to the other parties.
<P>

27	The cause was set down for hearing on 19 September 1988 when there was a
further adjournment because the defendant Koumandakis
was not legally
represented.  He was afforded an opportunity to apply for legal aid.  The
matter was adjourned yet again on 21 October
1988 at which time consideration
was being given to a separate trial on the issue between the defendants and the
insurer as to the
formers' right to indemnity under the statutory policy.
<P>

28	Eventually the cause proceeded to hearing before Allen J in April 1989 and
his Honour delivered judgment in favour of the deceased
against the defendants
on 6 September 1989, awarding damages, inclusive of interest, in the sum of
$324,872.  His Honour also ordered
that the insurer indemnify the defendants in
respect of their liability to the extent of the cover afforded to them under
the statutory
policy in the sum of $100,000.  His Honour ordered the defendants
to pay the deceased's costs and there were other orders made to
which it is
unnecessary to refer for present purposes.
<P>

29	Neither defendant had assets against which the judgment could be enforced
and the only money made available to the deceased to
satisfy the judgment was
the sum of $100,000 under the statutory policy.  The deceased had enjoyed a
grant of legal aid and was called
upon to account to the statutory authority
out of that sum.  Eventually, after a dispute as to quantum, the legal aid
authority agreed
to accept $25,125 in satisfaction of its claim.  This left a
balance of $74,875 available to the deceased.  The deceased refused
to accept
that sum, apparently by reason of concern that receipt would prejudice his
pursuit of the balance of the judgment debt,
but eventually the nett proceeds
of the policy payment were received by his estate.
<P>

	<b>The admissibility of expert evidence</b>
<P>

30	In the course of the presentation of the plaintiffs' case, Mr Howen
introduced two witnesses to give expert evidence.  The first
of those was Mr
Stephen O'Halloran, a solicitor of this court with lengthy experience in the
field with which this cause is concerned.
 Mr Kaye raised no objection to his
qualifications nor as to the relevant evidence which Mr Howen sought to
introduce and did introduce.
 Mr O'Halloran's report was tendered in evidence
as Exhibit D and he was also asked questions directed to the further amended
particulars
of negligence presented when the hearing began.
<P>

31	Mr Howen also sought to introduce evidence from the former Chief Judge of
the Compensation Court, Mr Frank Roland McGrath, OBE.
 Mr Kaye objected to the
introduction of the evidence of this witness, but it was received subject to
objection, and on the basis
I would rule upon its admissibility in the course
of this judgment.  Having regard to the conclusions I have reached on factual
issues
critical to my approach to this case, the issue of the admissibility of
Mr McGrath's evidence does not assume practical significance.
 Nevertheless for
completion, I address the issue.
<P>

32	The evidence of the former judge was contained essentially in his report,
Exhibit F.  This report dealt largely with the same
subject matter as that
addressed by Mr O'Halloran.  Where Mr McGrath differed from Mr O'Halloran was
in the evidence he gave concerning
what, in his opinion, ought to have been
done at the time instructions were first received by the defendant.  Mr McGrath
considered
that the defendant should, at the outset, have made inquiries to
ascertain the insurance cover enjoyed by the employers.
<P>

33	The authorities make it plain that expert evidence may be called to prove
what is common practice amongst solicitors of good
repute.  Mr O'Halloran gave
evidence that fell within that principle when he addressed the issue as to when
inquiry about insurance
first became warranted.
<P>

34	Mr Kaye however submitted that Mr McGrath was not qualified to give evidence
as to that matter.  As the former judge acknowledged,
he practised as a
solicitor only for a period of eighteen months before his admission to the Bar
in 1951 and the pursuit of his distinguished
career as a barrister and
subsequently as a judge.
<P>

35	For relevant purposes the particular expertise of Mr McGrath is, in my
opinion, to be distinguished from that of Mr O'Halloran.
 I do not consider the
former judge to be qualified, in strictness, to give evidence as to what was
common practice amongst solicitors
of good repute either in 1978 or
subsequently.  Indeed the witness acknowledged this himself when in cross
examination, and having
been directed to the evidence of Mr O'Halloran, Mr
McGrath said, referring to evidence as to the practice in 1977 and 1978:
<P>

	<i>"Well at that stage I couldn't say whether it was general practice because
I was not in practice at that stage myself."</i>
<P>

36	I conclude that the evidence that Mr McGrath gave as to what ought to have
been done by the defendant upon receipt of instructions
was not admissible and
I cannot act upon that evidence in this case.
<P>

37	There is often a fine line to be drawn between what is and what is not
admissible in the nature of expert evidence.  Mr McGrath
unquestionably had a
wealth of experience upon which to draw in expressing the conclusions he did
express in his report, but the
content of the report in large part addresses
matters that I must determine and which are not appropriate issues for expert
evidence.
 However persuasive I might consider Mr McGrath's opinions, heeding
my regard for his experience in the law, it does not seem to
me that I should
treat their expression as evidence in this case.
<P>

38	I do not intend to convey that a former judge of a court could never be
qualified to give expert evidence.  Indeed the contrary
was recognised in
<i>Scott v Echegary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20ATR%2081%2d120" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) ATR 81-120</a>, 69,129 at 69,133 where Mahoney JA,
with whose judgment Gleeson CJ and Kirby P agreed, observed in a case that
required a determination
of the measure of damages in common law proceedings at
a particular time in the past, and the value of workers' compensation rights
at
the same time, that expert evidence would ordinarily be required as to those
matters absent a contrary agreement between the parties
to the litigation.  See
also <i>Williams &amp; Ors v Bodewes</i> (unreported, Court of Appeal, 1
October 1997).
<P>

39	It seems to me that in the present case the former judge was qualified to
quantify past entitlements to workers' compensation
benefits given particular
assumptions, although it would be for this Court to find whether such
assumptions were established on the
evidence.  Through Mr McGrath a schedule of
rates of payments was properly introduced, as was the "Jamberoo Schedule", to
which resort
was apparently had in the Compensation Court in awarding interest
in respect of awards in that court.
<P>

<b>The defendant's duty of care and the alleged breaches of duty
considered</b>
<P>

40	By reason of the solicitor/client relationship the defendant owed to the
deceased a duty to exercise reasonable care in the pursuit
of the deceased's
instructions.  The defendant's responsibility was to do that which the
reasonable competent practitioner would
do having regard to the standards
normally adopted in his profession:  see <i>Midland Bank v Hett Stubbs and
Kemp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Ch 384</a> at 403.
<P>

41	In the present case it is submitted that the defendant was in breach of his
duty of care in a number of ways.  I set out the
particulars of negligence in
their ultimate amended form:
<P>

<i>a.	The Defendant failed to advise the deceased of the consequences of
electing to commence proceedings for common law damages compared
to the
Defendant's rights under the Workers Compensation Act 1926.</i>
<P>

<i>b.	The Defendant failed to advise the deceased that in 1977 employers were
only required to have a level of indemnity of $100,000
for the common law
extension to a contract of insurance for workers' compensation.</i>
<P>

<i>c.	The Defendant failed to consider the possibility of the employers'
contract of insurance being insufficient to cover a possible
award of common
law damages and failed to communicate to the deceased the possibility of not
being able to recover the entire verdict
in common law from the employer's
insurer.</i>
<P>

<i>d.	The Defendant failed to make any timely enquiry in relation to the
particulars of the employers' common law extension in their
contract of
insurance relating to workers' compensation.</i>
<P>

<i>e.	The Defendant failed to make timely or proper enquiries in relation to
the assets owned by the deceased's employers or advise the
deceased of the need
to consider the financial position of the employers.</i>
<P>

<i>f.	The Defendant failed to advise the deceased that he could make an
application for periodic benefits of workers' compensation which
would remain
payable up to the date of any judgment for common law damages.</i>
<P>

<i>g.	The Defendant failed to advise the deceased that if the deceased received
a verdict in the common law proceedings, any periodic
benefits received under
the Workers' Compensation Act 1926 would be repaid from the common law damages
received.</i>
<P>

<i>h.	The Defendant failed to advise the deceased of the consequences on his
rights under the Workers Compensation Act 1926 if the deceased
received a
verdict for common law damages.</i>
<P>

<i>i.	Once the Defendant became aware of the limit on the employers' common law
extension to the contract of insurance, the Defendant
failed to give advice to
the deceased as to his options in either discontinuing the common law action or
proceeding to a hearing.</i>
<P>

<i>j.	The Defendant caused delay in the prosecution of the deceased's action in
the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</i>
<P>

<i>k.	The Defendant failed to take steps to enforce the judgment of Justice
Allen in relation to the award of damages or costs in favour
of the
deceased.</i>
<P>

42	Of the above particulars Mr Howen informed the Court that he did not pursue
particular (e) but the balance of the particulars
call for consideration
now.
<P>

<i>Particulars (a), (f), (g) and (h)</i>
<P>

43	It is convenient to consider the matters particularised in (a), (f), (g) and
(h) together.
<P>

44	I set out earlier the evidence that the defendant gave as to the terms of
the advice given to the deceased and I accept that
such advice was in fact
conveyed.  The defendant's evidence satisfies me that he gave the deceased
adequate advice on the matters
the subject of these particulars, and that such
advice was given by early 1978.  I am satisfied that the deceased made it plain
to
the defendant at that time that he wanted to pursue lump sum damages at
common law and was not interested in the pursuit of periodic
claims under the
<i>Workers' Compensation Act.</i>
<P>

45	Those clear instructions did not however, in my opinion, relieve the
defendant of the duty to consider from time to time whether
the deceased had
rights under the <i>Workers' Compensation Act</i>, particularly in
circumstances where, as in this case, the claim at common law took so long to
be heard.  There came a time, which
I shall presently identify, by which the
defendant should, in my opinion, have advised the deceased of the pursuit of
the workers'
compensation benefits as a possible alternative to proceeding with
his claim for damages at common law.  However that was much later
in the
relationship and I shall identify that time shortly.
<P>

<i>Particular (b)</i>
<P>

46	It was the position that in 1977 the workers' compensation legislation made
it compulsory for employers to have a policy of insurance
with a common law
extension of no less than $100,000.  Whether an employer insured against its
common law risk for more than $100,000
was optional.
<P>

47	I find that the defendant did not advise the deceased in 1977 of the
statutory limit imposed, but I am not satisfied that he
was negligent in
failing to give such advice then.  At that time common law damages attracted in
claims for personal injuries were
very much less than they were when the
deceased's cause was eventually heard.  I accept the evidence given by Mr
O'Halloran, an experienced
solicitor in this field, that in 1977 a reasonably
competent solicitor would not have been concerned with the statutory limit of
indemnity.  I accept that as the deceased presented in 1977 the statutory limit
would have appeared to be more than adequate to meet
the deceased's claim.  By
the time the Application for Determination was filed in the Workers'
Compensation Commission on 2 December
1977 the deceased was back at work,
earning more than he had been as an apprentice panel beater, and the medical
prognosis was reasonable.
 I do not therefore consider that the defendant was
in breach of his duty of care to the deceased in not telling him of the
statutory
limit in 1977.
<P>

<i>Particulars (c) and (d)</i>
<P>

48	At the outset of course the defendant alerted the deceased to the risk that
any award of common law damages may have to be satisfied,
if at all, by resort
to the assets of the employers themselves.  I am satisfied that the deceased
was made aware before any proceedings
were brought, either under the statute or
at common law, that there was a real risk that the insurer may avoid
liability.
<P>

49	As the deceased's solicitor however, I consider the defendant was under an
obligation to alert the deceased to the risk that
common law damages properly
recoverable, could exceed the statutory limit, once such risk ought reasonably
to have been perceived.
 The defendant knew at all relevant times that the
employers were only required by statute to ensure in respect of their common
law
risk for $100,000, so that once there was the risk that damages might
exceed that limit, I am satisfied that the defendant owed the
deceased a duty
to inquire as to the level of insurance and to alert the deceased to it.
<P>

50	It does not seem to me that there was an obligation on the defendant to make
the inquiry indicated or to alert the deceased to
the level of insurance at any
time prior to the hearing date appointed in this court for 9 June 1982.
Looking at the particulars
filed pursuant to Practice Note 19 and dated 22
January 1982, the deceased was claiming out of pocket expenses of approximately
$4000
and loss of income in approximately the same amount.  Even allowing for a
claim for future loss of earning capacity and general damages
for the non
economic aspects, it was not unreasonable for the defendant to consider in 1982
that the compulsory statutory cover would
have been more than adequate to
satisfy a successful claim by the deceased.  As to this I do not overlook the
evidence that senior
counsel advised shortly before the hearing date in 1982
that it would be difficult to establish any claim for future loss of earning
capacity.
<P>

51	However as the delay in the hearing thereafter increased so too did the
possible verdict range.  There is no doubt that damages
became inflated in the
1980s and 1990s for a variety of reasons which it is unnecessary to explore or
record in the present context.
<P>

52	It seems to me that there came a point of time when the defendant ought
reasonably to have perceived a risk that the deceased's
damages could exceed
$100,000.  This point of time had certainly been reached by 19 September 1988
when, as Exhibit 10 records, Mr
Puckeridge of Queen's Counsel, then briefed to
appear for the deceased, advised that settlement of his claim be explored with
an
opening figure of $150,000.  It was shortly thereafter, on 6 October 1988,
that the defendant was alerted through a message conveyed
by counsel that the
relevant policy had a limit of $100,000.  The defendant confirmed that by
inspecting the policy on 7 October
1988.
<P>

53	Mr Milton Hatzigeorgiou gave evidence that Mr Puckeridge's recommendation as
to an approach to settlement was made in conference
<i>"some time in 1987"</i>
but I consider he is mistaken.  The defendant's evidence in point is supported
by his file note, Exhibit 10, and I find that senior
counsel's recommendation
was made on 19 September 1988.
<P>

54	I am satisfied that once the defendant became aware of the limit of the
insurance cover he informed the deceased, and I accept
his evidence that he
advised the deceased that if he recovered more than $100,000, or if the insurer
was not held liable under the
policy, the deceased would be dependent upon
recourse to his former employers to satisfy any verdict.
<P>

55	The defendant did not go on to advise the deceased at this stage that rather
than proceed with his common law claim in such circumstances
he might
discontinue it, and pursue his remedies under the <i>Workers' Compensation
Act</i>.
<P>

56	It was the defendant's evidence that he gave consideration in October 1988
to discontinuing the common law proceedings, but he
decided against that course
for reasons which he expressed in his evidence (T 204-206):
<P>

	<i>"[I] decided there were too many penalties or that Con would face real
penalties as to costs and I also had - sorry.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  If we could just deal with it one at a time.  Was there anything about
his medical history or your observations as to his physical
ability or
disability which played a part in your consideration of that matter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And what was that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  It being either no treatment for injuries in the period between the
June adjournment date and time we were told of the cap or
if there had been I
hadn't been advised of it.  The only medical issue that had arisen had been a
matter involving his GP, Dr Borden,
who told me at one stage, and I can't
recall when that was, he said, `He has had something like a boil', I can't
remember the expression
used `or a boil or an outbreak on his belly where his
belt is tight.  I have given him cream for that.'  And that was the skin I
think, he said the skin is devitalised.  That was the end of my dealings with
Dr Borden otherwise there was no referral to or there
was no seeking of any
medical treatment in that time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  I had asked you to give consideration to the medical history that when
you had in mind when giving consideration to the possibility
of discontinuing.
Was there anything that you observed yourself about Mr Hatzigeorgiou that
played a part in your decision making?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I saw Mr Hatzigeorgiou from time to time.  He came into my office.  I
think we'd walked up to court or we'd been - we walked
somewhere together on a
couple of occasions.  We had a number of meetings on a fairly informal basis
where we sat down and drank
coffee and smoked and chatted over his health or
about his health and although he had certainly put on some weight, he walked as
fast as I did and I didn't notice anything that suggested that he wasn't able
to conduct his normal operations, normal affairs.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Also in the course of your consideration as to whether or not to
discontinue the claims, was there anything by way of his, that
is Mr
Hatzigeorgiou's instructions, that played a role in your consideration?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Sorry.  I didn't understand that question.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Is there anything that you recall in terms of Mr Hatzigeorgiou's
earlier instructions to you as to the carriage of his legal
matters that
influenced you in your considerations?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What were they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  When we'd be talking very early, that is in about the time of the
Compensation Court proceedings, Mr Hatzigeorgiou had been adamant
against
workers' compensation proceedings and at the time of the workers' compensation
proceedings he'd said something along the
lines, `I am sick and tired of these
sort of proceedings.  I don't want to become involved in them again.  I want to
go through the
Supreme Court.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Were comments of that nature expressed by Mr Hatzigeorgiou after
1979?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No.  I don't think they were.  We didn't - I don't think we discussed
directly bringing further workers' compensation proceedings
after that.</i>
<P>

<i>	...................</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And you had referred to the question of costs.  In what manner did that
issue bear upon your consideration?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I expected that if we discontinued there'd be a substantial claim for
costs against Mr Hatzigeorgiou.  The defendants between
them had had eight
firms of solicitors acting for them at different times and I believe they'd had
counsel on a number of occasions
and there'd been quite a number of court
attendances for various purposes so that I expected that be a very substantial
bill had
been run up.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And at the time that you considered that issue did you have any
information available to you which suggested Mr Petrou, one of
the
co-defendants in the suit, was suffering under any financial disability at the
time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Not that I can recall.</i>
<P>

<i>	HIS HONOUR:  Q.  Did you have any evidence about that one way or the other,
Mr Baker?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Not that I - no."</i>
<P>

57	I accept that the defendant did give consideration to the discontinuance of
the common law proceedings weighing the matters he
instanced.  It was
reasonable that he take those matters into account but it seems to me, whatever
weight he attached to those considerations,
his responsibility to the deceased
nevertheless required that he advise the deceased of his possible options, and
give him advice
as to what he might reasonably hope to recover if he was
permitted to discontinue the proceedings at common law and return to the
Workers' Compensation Commission.  I accept the evidence which Mr O'Halloran
gave on this issue.  I find further that the defendant
was in breach of his
duty of care to the deceased in not advising him as to the possible alternative
course, so as to permit the
deceased to make an informed decision as to how and
where he should proceed.
<P>

58	Mr Howen has submitted that this case should attract an award of damages
based upon the value of the deceased's workers' compensation
rights for the
period immediately beyond the date of his award in that jurisdiction in
February 1979 until the time of his death
in November 1993.  He submitted that
the findings made by Allen J as to the deceased's incapacity over the period to
the date of
trial would support an assessment of the value of such rights at
the maximum weekly rate throughout.  Further, he submitted that
the evidence of
Mr Milton Hatzigeorgiou and of Dr Piliotis establishes that the deceased's
condition, and hence his capacity for
work, only deteriorated between the date
of judgment and the date of death.  On this approach Mr Howen submitted a
schedule quantifying
the lost entitlement at $118,993.20.  He submitted an
award of that magnitude would have attracted interest in the Compensation Court
according to the "Jamberoo Schedule" in the sum of $78,533.  Those figures, of
course, are calculated on gross weekly payments and
would require adjustment
here allowing for the incidence of taxation and for the payment that was made
by the insurer after judgment.
<P>

59	There is however a more fundamental difficulty with Mr Howen's submission.
It is for the plaintiffs to prove that the negligence
I have found in failing
to remind the deceased of, and to fully advise him of, his workers'
compensation rights was causative of
loss.  Assuming the defendant had given
the deceased the advice I find he should have given, would the deceased have
decided to abandon
his common law claim and go to the Compensation Court?
<P>

60	I consider this is improbable but since I am dealing with a hypothetical
event that does not necessary determine the matter.
 I am required to determine
the degree of probability that he would have decided to return to his workers'
compensation rights, had
he been properly advised, and to assess the value of
the chance of his having done so:  see <i>Malec v JC Hutton Pty Limited</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 169 CLR 638</a> at 642-643; and <i>Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%2d94%5d%20179%20CLR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992-94] 179 CLR 332</a> at 350-355.
<P>

61	I regard the chance of the deceased having decided upon proper advice to
return to the Compensation Court to be highly unlikely,
and indeed to be so low
as to be speculative.  I so conclude for a number of reasons:
<P>

(i)	the firm instructions given at the outset to seek damages at common law,
given at a time when there was a doubt recognised by
the deceased that the
insurer would have any liability at all;
<P>

(ii)	the fact that an award in the Compensation Court would have included
nothing by way of lump sum for pain and suffering, and
the deceased's desire to
have compensation for this;
<P>

(iii)	the deceased's unreal perception of the value of his claim.  He told the
defendant he believed his claim was worth between
$800,000 and $1.2 million at
common law;
<P>

(iv)	proper advice would have alerted the deceased to the possibility,
notwithstanding eventual payment of the earlier closed period
award, that the
insurer might avoid liability under the policy;
<P>

(v)	the deceased demonstrated a distrust for his legal advisers in 1988.  He
went so far as to accuse his counsel of being corrupt
and to be conspiring with
the insurer.  In consequence he rejected the advice as to settlement given by
Mr Puckeridge of Queen's
Counsel.  Indeed the defendant's file note dated 25
October 1988 records that having reflected upon his attitude towards
settlement,
the deceased instructed the defendant that he wanted $600,000 by
way of settlement, comprising $300,000 for loss of wages and $300,000
for
damages.
<P>

(vi)	it seems to me that any advice given by the defendant closely following
the advice of senior counsel was no less likely to
influence the deceased;
<P>

(vii)	by 1988 the deceased had been waiting ten years for his claim for damages
to be heard.  To change courts in 1988 would have
involved further significant
delay;
<P>

(viii)	it would have been necessary to advise the deceased that there may be a
very heavy costs penalty in walking away from the
common law claim.
<P>

62	Having regard to the above matters, I do not consider that had the defendant
given the appropriate advice concerning the Compensation
Court option in 1988
this would have deflected the deceased from his resolve to pursue his claim in
the Supreme Court.
<P>

63	It does not follow however that the plaintiffs are here without remedy,
because of the significance of the delay in the common
law proceedings.
However, before addressing that issue it is convenient to address the last of
the particulars of negligence advanced
by Mr Howen.
<P>

<i>Particular (k)</i>
<P>

64	It is submitted that the deceased was negligent in failing to take steps to
enforce the judgment of this court in relation to
the award of damages and
costs.
<P>

65	Proceedings on the judgment were stayed by order of the trial judge until 6
October 1989.  The defendant's instructions were
withdrawn on 20 November 1989.
It follows that the defendant had some six weeks to act in seeking to enforce
the judgment concerning
damages and costs.
<P>

66	The defendant was by no means idle following the judgment.  The activity of
the defendant is reflected by the documents to be
found in Exhibit 20.
<P>

67	Following the judgment the defendant had to address and did address a number
of issues:
<P>

(i)	what could be done to enforce the judgment;
<P>

(ii)	what was to be done about the pending appeal;
<P>

(iii)	what was the deceased's obligation to the Legal Aid Commission.
<P>

68	Exhibit 20 satisfies me that the defendant approached his responsibilities
to the deceased with due care between the date of
the judgment and the date
that his instructions were withdrawn.  I do not consider that he ought
reasonably to have been expected
to have done more than he did do in the
limited time available to him prior to 20 November 1989.  Accordingly this head
of negligence
has not been established.
<P>

<i>Particular (j)</i>
<P>

69	Earlier I traced in outline the history of the common law action from its
commencement in May 1978 until the hearing some eleven
years later.
<P>

70	I am satisfied that the defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in
an endeavour to have the case listed for hearing
as soon as was reasonably
practicable.  Clearly delay may occur in the interlocutory stages of
proceedings which a solicitor for
a party cannot effectively control.  The
progress of a cause can be slowed by complications, as for instance where a
party is applying
for legal aid.  Interlocutory applications inevitably slow
the progress of a cause.
<P>

71	In this case the defendant failed to attend several directions hearings
before the hearing date vacated in 1982.  However I am
not persuaded those
oversights were causative of discernible delay.  Notwithstanding Mr Howen's
submission to the contrary, I am
not satisfied that there was delay caused by
negligence of the defendant in the progress of the matter up to 9 June 1982.
<P>

72	However there was gross delay thereafter and I find that responsibility for
the delay has to be attributed to the defendant.
 In my opinion it was
unreasonable to wait so long for the expert's report.  Allowing for the fact
that there were amendments to
the pleadings, interrogatories and other events
referred to in the agreed chronology, it seems to me that had the defendant
exercised
that degree of care as was reasonably to be expected of him in having
this matter brought to trial, it should have been heard by
mid 1984, that is to
say approximately five years before it was.  The delay cannot be excused by
difficulties in qualifying a suitable
expert nor by reference to the plight in
which the defendant found himself by reason of being overworked during the
relevant period.
<P>

73	I do not understand Mr Kaye to have submitted to the contrary but in any
event I am satisfied that negligence by reason of delay
has been proved against
the defendant.
<P>

74	Mr Kaye submitted however that I should find that the deceased contributed
to the delay and that I should accordingly find contributory
negligence.
Counsel referred me to para 4(d) of the defence filed wherein it was asserted
that:
<P>

	<i>"The defendant repeats and relies upon the finding of Mr Justice Allen that
both the late Mr Hatzigeorgiou and the defendant bore
joint responsibility for
the delay."</i>
<P>

75	That sub-paragraph is not apt as a pleading by way of contributory
negligence, which pleading is required by Pt 15 r 14 of the
<i>Rules of
Court</i>.  Moreover, no particulars of a defence of contributory negligence
have been given as required by Pt 16 r 4.  I put to one side those
difficulties
confronting the defendant on this issue and turn to consider whether the
defence of contributory negligence could be
maintained in any event.
<P>

76	Allen J made a finding referred to in para 4(d) of the defence when
considering the deceased's claim for interest in the earlier
cause.  What his
Honour said was this:
<P>

	<i>"But I do not allow interest from the time of the occurrence of the
accident - nor indeed from the time when the proceedings for damages
were
commenced.  There has been gross delay in the proceedings being brought to
trial.  Much of that delay is to be attributed to
lack of drive being
demonstrated not only by the plaintiff personally but also by his solicitors.
In the result the general damages
which have been awarded are a reflection of
money values which are markedly different from the values which would have been
in force
at the time when these proceedings, if prosecuted with due diligence,
would have come on for trial."</i>
<P>

77	For the purposes of his judgment his Honour was considering delay over the
entire period that the cause was on foot, some eleven
years.  It is clear that
the deceased was responsible for delay before the cause was first listed for
hearing in 1982 because he
failed to furnish required particulars of his post
injury work history.  However the evidence does not persuade me that any
efforts
the defendant made to have the cause progress to hearing thereafter
were frustrated either by any activity or inactivity of the deceased.
<P>

78	I have considered the evidence that the defendant gave and I have considered
the documentary evidence.  None of this evidence
indicates to me that the
deceased failed to co-operate with the defendant at any time after the hearing
date was vacated in June
1982.  There was no failure to attend a medical
appointment nor was there any failure to attend any conference appointed such
as
might have delayed the progress of the matter.  File notes record that the
deceased kept the defendant informed as to his work history
and his progress:
see, for example, Exhibits V, W, Z, AA, BB, DD, EE, JJ, KK, NN and QQ.
<P>

79	It would be for the defendant to prove contributory negligence and in this
context requisite proof would require the defendant
to establish that the
plaintiff contributed to the relevant period of delay that I have found.  The
defendant has failed to prove
such contribution.
<P>

80	I conclude therefore that the deceased was deprived of the benefit of a
judgment in the proceedings for five years by reason
of delay for which the
defendant was responsible.
<P>

81	It seems to me to be a correct approach to the assessment of damages to
compensate for that deprivation.  What the deceased lost
was resort to the
judgment sum he would have recovered over a period of five years.
<P>

82	Mr Howen had submitted two alternative approaches to the assessment of
damages.  The first of those I have already considered
and rejected, finding as
I do that the deceased would not have been prompted by appropriate advice to
change courts.  Mr Howen's
alternative submission was that a finding of
negligence against the defendant should result in an assessment of damages
against him
in the amount of the judgment to the extent that it remains
unsatisfied.  In my opinion that submission cannot be sustained, because
I do
not find that shortfall to be the measure of the harm caused by the defendant's
negligence.  In my view it plainly is not.
<P>

83	Ultimately neither Mr Kaye nor Mr Howen submitted it would be erroneous to
approach the assessment of damages in the manner I
have indicated, although
there were competing submissions concerning the deceased's contribution to the
delay, what should be deducted
for legal aid, and how interest should be
calculated.
<P>

84	Had damages been assessed in this case in the middle of 1984 I am satisfied
on the balance of probabilities they would have been
assessed at a figure in
excess of $100,000 but less than $324,872.  In so concluding, I am mindful of
the findings relevant to damages
that were made by Allen J in 1989, and which
counsel agreed I should adopt for the purposes of this trial.
<P>

85	Before Allen J, the medical, hospital and like expenses were agreed at
$4291.68.  His Honour found wage loss to the end of 1981
of $9639.  Between 1
January 1982 and 11 September 1985 his Honour found a wage loss of $17,017.
For the period from 1 January 1982
to 30 June 1984, on a pro rata basis, the
loss was to be measured at $11,330 approximately by reference to his Honour's
approach.
 Hence wage loss and out of pocket expenses as at 30 June 1984 would
have attracted an allowance of $25,260, in round figures.
<P>

86	His Honour found an ongoing loss of $135 per week in 1989 but the loss in
1984 he had found to be less, of the order of $87 per
week.  To compensate for
a loss of that order to age sixty-five, the plaintiff being in 1984 twenty-six
years of age, would have
required, on the three percent tables, after a
discount of fifteen percent for the vicissitudes, the sum of $89,333.
<P>

87	For what are essentially the economic aspects and adopting Allen J's
findings, the case would have attracted the following allowances
(omitting
cents):
<P>

Medical and hospital expenses	$4,291
<P>

Past loss of wages	20,969
<P>

Allowance for future economic loss	<u>89,333</u>
<P>

	$114,593
<P>

88	Again, having regard to his Honour's findings as to the nature and extent of
the injuries sustained and their effect upon the
plaintiff, it seems to me that
the case in 1984 would have attracted by way of general damages for the
non-economic aspects, approximately
$60,000.
<P>

89	On this approach, total damages that would have been assessed would have
been of the order of $174,593 and that assessment would,
of course, have
attracted interest.
<P>

90	I acknowledge the artificiality of the assessment I have just undertaken.
However whether I adopt that approach or not, I am
satisfied that had damages
been assessed in June 1984, on the basis of the relevant findings of Allen J,
which counsel have invited
me to accept, the damages recovered would certainly
have been no less than $100,000.
<P>

91	It follows that had the cause proceeded to trial in the middle of 1984, the
deceased would have received the sum of $100,000
earlier, less whatever was
deducted under the relevant legal aid scheme.
<P>

92	It is impossible to determine with precision what the Legal Aid Commission
would have claimed from the verdict in 1984.  In 1989
it sought to recover
initially $81,093 which was one-quarter of the gross judgment sum.  It
subsequently reduced that claim to $50,000
and eventually settled for
$25,125.
<P>

93	As the <i>Legal Services Commission Act</i> stood in 1984, s 46 provided:
<P>

<i>	"<b>46.  (1)  </b>Except as provided by subsection (2C)(a), a legally
assisted person shall not be liable to make any payment to the Commission or a
private legal practitioner in respect of the costs and expenses of the legal
services provided to him as a legally assisted person
in excess of the amount
of the contribution, if any, determined by the Commission under section
36(1)(a) in respect of the provision
of those legal services.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>(2)</b>  Where a legally assisted person receives an amount of money as
a consequence of the provision of legal services to him as a legally
assisted
person, the Commission shall determine the amount payable by him in respect of
the costs and expenses of the legal services.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>(2A)</b>  The amount determined under subsection (2) in respect of a
legally assisted person shall not exceed -</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	where the amount of money received by him does not exceed the prescribed
amount - one-third of the amount of money received by
him; or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	where the amount of money received by him exceeds the prescribed amount
- an amount equal to the sum of one-third of the prescribed
amount and the
amount of money received by him in excess of the prescribed amount.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>(2B)  </b>For the purposes of subsection (2A), the prescribed amount is
$6000 or such other amount as the Commission may from time to time
determine."</i>
<P>

94	The certificate evidencing the grant of legal aid in this case to the
deceased forms part of Exhibit 21.  It records that the
deceased was called
upon to make no actual contribution at the time of the grant on 25 October 1977
and the form of the certificate
was called in aid in disputing the assessment
of the deceased's liability in 1989.  
<P>

95	Whilst the Legal Aid Commission may, under s 46 as it then provided, have
looked for as much as one-third of the sum of $100,000
had it been available in
1984, it is possible also, since the gross judgment would have been
substantially less in 1984 than it was
in 1989, that the Commission would have
been less demanding in 1984 than it proved to be ultimately in 1989.
<P>

96	Doing the best I can I propose to approach my assessment on the basis that
the Legal Aid Commission would have determined the
amount payable from the
judgment in 1984 to have been $25,000.  Accordingly, the nett sum which the
deceased would have had available
for his use I find on the probabilities would
have been $75,000.
<P>

97	It seems to me that I should compensate the plaintiffs for the loss of the
use of that sum for five years from 1 July 1984 onwards.
 No interest rates
have been put before me.  One measure of calculation would be to use the rates
prescribed under Schedule J of
the <i>Rules of Court</i>.  Mr Howen invited
that approach; Mr Kaye submitted that the rates in the schedule may not have
reflected what was commercially available
at the relevant time.
<P>

98	There is, of course, no evidence before me as to how the deceased would have
invested this sum, had he enjoyed access to it in
1984.  He may not have
invested it at all but spent it either on necessities or luxuries.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that I can
arrive at no fairer measure of damages
than to compensate for the loss of the investment potential of the sum of
$75,000.  I do not
propose to employ the Schedule J rates rigidly, but, guided
by those rates, I assess compensation by awarding sixteen percent of
$75,000
for five years.  On this approach I assess damages in this case at $60,000.
<P>

99	That sum is the measure of compensation for the loss suffered over a five
year period ending in 1989 and I am asked to award
interest on that sum
pursuant to s 94 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.</i>
<P>

100	Mr Kaye has submitted that I should limit the period for which I award
interest because of the delay that occurred in the present
proceedings.
Exhibit 22 is an agreed chronology of the history of this action and it is
plain from studying the exhibit that the
delay was very considerable.
<P>

101	The deceased filed the statement of claim on 2 April 1990.  Following his
death an order was made appointing the plaintiffs
to represent the estate for
the purposes of this cause and the amended statement of claim, to which I
earlier referred, was not filed
until March 1995.  I do not propose to record
the detail contained in the chronology but a consideration of it compels the
conclusion
that the very considerable delay must be attributed to the
plaintiffs.  Their failure to take necessary steps frustrated an earlier
hearing of this cause.  When eventually a hearing date was allocated for 11
February 1997 the plaintiffs sought an adjournment then
so that a belated
effort could be made to execute the judgment in the earlier proceedings against
the defendant Koumandakis.
<P>

102	Whilst the power to award interest under s 94 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></i> is a discretionary power, the discretion has to be exercised
judicially:  see <i>Bennett v Jones</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2 NSWLR 355</a> and <i>Marsland v
Andjelic [No. 2]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20649" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 649</a> at 652.  In the exercise of that
discretion it is generally a most important consideration that the plaintiffs
have been deprived
of the use of the sum of money awarded by way of damages,
whilst the defendant has been able to enjoy the continued use of such sum.
However that is not necessarily the only consideration, and where, as in this
case, there has been gross delay in the pursuit of
a claim, it seems to me that
this should be brought into account.  It is to be appreciated that the present
case is unlike a claim
for damages for personal injuries where it has long
since been recognised that delay has an impact by inflating damages, but
nevertheless
there are other consequences of delay in a case such as this.
<P>

103	To award interest for the full period approaching nine years, would be a
disincentive to the objective to be encouraged by the
court, namely to bring
litigation to an end as expeditiously as is reasonably possible.  This policy
consideration was referred to
as a factor bearing upon the award of interest by
Goff J (as he then was) in <i>BP Exploration Co v Hunt</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20WLR%20783" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 WLR 783</a> at
847 and by Kirby P (as he then was) in <i>Bryce v Tapalis</i> (unreported,
Court of Appeal, 10 February 1989).  This policy consideration is, in my
opinion, a relevant consideration in this case.
<P>

104	It is also to be heeded that the plaintiffs' failure to give particulars of
the claim for damages within a reasonable period,
and such failure is evident
on a study of Exhibit 21, must inevitably have frustrated any attempt the
defendant might otherwise have
sought to make to quantify his potential
liability and to consider compromise.  I observe that when the claim for
damages was particularised,
this was done on a basis not established at the
hearing.
<P>

105	With the above considerations in mind, but allowing for inevitable delay
not attributable to the plaintiffs by reason of the
death of the deceased, I
have come to the conclusion that I should allow interest for a period of five
years only.  Rates under Schedule
J have fallen appreciably over the period
since these proceedings were commenced in April 1990 and I take that into
account in allowing
interest on the damages assessed at fifteen percent for
five years.  I award interest therefore in the sum of $45,000.
<P>

106	Accordingly I arrive at the figure of $105,000 as the sum for which
judgment is to be entered.
<P>

	<b>Costs</b>
<P>

107	When the hearing date appointed for this cause in February 1997 was vacated
in the circumstances to which I have already referred,
the costs of the
adjournment were reserved.  Mr Kaye has submitted that the plaintiffs should
bear the defendant's costs in relation
to that adjournment and Mr Howen has not
sought to argue to the contrary.
<P>

108	That the proceedings were adjourned on 11 February 1997 was through no
fault of the defendant and justice requires that I order
the plaintiffs to pay
the defendant's costs thrown away by reason of that adjournment.
<P>

109	Since the plaintiff has succeeded in this cause, it seems to me that costs
should otherwise follow the event.
<P>

	<b>Formal orders</b>
<P>

110	1.	Judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $105,000.
<P>

2.	I order the plaintiffs to pay the defendant's costs thrown away by reason of
the vacation of the hearing date appointed for 11
February 1997.
<P>

3.	Save for such costs, I order the defendant to pay the plaintiffs' costs of
the cause.
