<b>101961/99 - ESTATE OF F J HUSZAR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an application referred to me by the Registrar
for rectification of a will.  The application has been referred from the
Registrar because it is out of time and the plaintiff also seeks costs out of
the estate.
<P>

2	The deceased, Frank Joseph Huszar, died on 20 July 1996.  The plaintiff, who
is a barrister but in 1988 (the date of the will
in question) was a solicitor,
was a family friend of the deceased.  The deceased has no known next-of-kin so
that any property that
passes on intestacy will pass to the Crown as bona
vacantia.  The Crown has been cited and has indicated that it does not consent
to the present application, but does not wish to be heard on it.  The matter
has accordingly proceeded ex parte on the documents.
<P>

3	The plaintiff says that in late 1988 the deceased asked him to draw up the
will, probate of which was subsequently granted.  This
was done in the
plaintiff's capacity as a friend and without charge.  On the first occasion
when the subject was mentioned, the deceased
produced a list of names of people
and institutions and said, "I want to leave everything to these people, in the
proportions which
I will work out".  The deceased made some calculations and
wrote various fractions alongside each name in the list under the heading
"proportion".  The plaintiff then wrote out the will by hand.  The deceased
altered some of the fractions on the will and then it
was executed. 
<P>

4	The will of which probate was granted contains 16 names.  The 16th name is
written in a finer ball point pen than the principal
text of the will and
probably in the same pen as was used by the testator and the witnesses to sign
the will.  The 16th beneficiary
appears as follows:
<P>

	"Christian Blind Mission International - Australia, 1245 Burke Rd, Kew.  VIC"

<P>

5	The "92" in the column adjacent to the above beneficiary appears unaltered.
Before each of the previous 15 names is a fraction
which appears originally to
have had a denominator of 91 but the denominator has been changed to 92 in each
case by writing over
the "1".  It would appear fairly clear that when the 16th
beneficiary was added for one share, the testator thought that he was
decreasing
the value of each share from a 91st to a 92nd of his estate.
<P>

6	Unfortunately, when one adds up the numerators of the fractions, one only
gets to 83.  Accordingly, if the will were to be construed
one would either
have the situation where the testator was intestate as to 9/92nds of his estate
or else one would have to read "92"
as a misnomer for "83".
<P>

7	The plaintiff seeks rectification.  Probate has been granted but Powell, J
held in <b>Re Brisbane </b>- 19 June 1992,  unreported, that this does not bar
an order being made for rectification.  I propose to follow that decision.
<P>

8	The first problem for the plaintiff to overcome is that this application was
not made within 18 months as required by s 29A of
the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and
Administration Act 1898</a>.  He thus has to demonstrate "sufficient cause" for the
extension of time.
<P>

9	The application should have been made no later than 20 January 1998.  In fact
it was made on 15 February 1999, more than one year
out of time.  The excuse
given is that the plaintiff considered that it was obvious that the testator on
the true construction of
the will intended to give the whole of his estate away
and that there was a mathematical error in the calculation of the denominator
of the fractions.  However, the Crown is affected, it does not consent (neither
it should be said does it say anything in opposition),
and the executor needs
the protection of either rectification or a construction suit.  Although the
Court must be careful to ensure
that too much laxity does not prevail, a fairly
benign attitude has in the past been taken to applications for extension of
time,
particularly in small estates where the real practical reason for the
delay was the executor's desire to save the estate costs. 
I believe in the
circumstances of this case sufficient cause has been shown for the delay.
<P>

10	I then proceed to the merits of the application.  Although the
corresponding English section (s 20 of the Administration of Justice
Act 1982)
is in more restrictive terms than the NSW section, some of the methods of
approach used in England are useful guides as
to how this jurisdiction should
be exercised.  In <b>Re Segelman </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20Ch%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] Ch 171</a>, 180, Chadwick J said that
the legislation required the Court to examine three questions:  only the first
two are relevant in NSW,
viz "First, what were the testator's intentions with
regard to the dispositions in respect of which rectification is sought.
Secondly,
whether the will is so expressed that it fails to carry out those
intentions."  I consider this is the appropriate way of proceeding
because the
main question in these cases is:  what was the testator's intention?
<P>

11	It has been assumed in these sort of cases that one applies the same sort of
test as one would apply in respect of a suit for
rectification of a document in
equity.  This may be overstating the position because in <b>Mortensen v State
of New South Wales </b>- 12 December 1991, unreported, Sheller JA in the Court
of Appeal said that it might be productive of error in a particular case "to
pay over much regard to the principles evolved by equity as part of the
doctrine of rectification."  However, where the Court can
see what I call "the
ordinary rectification test" is satisfied it will be much more comfortable than
it might otherwise be, especially
in an ex parte case.
<P>

12	The facts of the case are rather like the facts in <b>Re Brisbane
</b>(supra).  In that case the testator directed his trustee to divide the
balance of his estate into nine equal shares and then gave
one of those shares
to each of five groups of people.  Powell J rectified the will by deleting the
word "nine". 
<P>

13	It is of comfort that Powell J did approach a similar problem to this the
way he did in <b>Brisbane's case</b>, but even without that, in my view the
present is a clear case.  The will shows all the signs of the testator having
wished to dispose
of all his estate to his list of beneficiaries.  When the
16th beneficiary was added, he recalculated the fractions.   He had no
next-of-kin whom he might want to benefit by having part of his estate on an
intestacy.  It would seem that the only way one can
read the testator's
intention was that he wished his estate to be divided into as many shares as
were the numerators of his fractions
and accordingly the order should be
granted that in each case "92" should be struck out and replaced with "83".
<P>

14	As I said earlier, the matter was only referred to me because the
Registrar's powers under Part 78 r5(1)(q) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules 1970</a> do
not extend to extending the time for making an application or for making an
order for costs.  Whilst it was appropriate to refer
the present case to me, I
consider that these ancillary matters should ordinarily be dealt with by
referring the file to the Judge
in charge of the Probate List for the ancillary
matters to be referred to the Registrar under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p78" class="autolink_findacts">Part 78</a> r5(2) of the Rules, or
alternatively, the Registrar making a report to that Judge to the effect that
the ancillary matters are in
order so far as the Registrar is concerned and
no-one opposes the ancillary orders being made.  By "ancillary orders" I mean
orders
such as extending the time for making the application and orders for
costs.
<P>

15	As to costs, the plaintiff only seeks that the filing fee be paid out of the
estate.  It may or may not be that he intends to
apply for commission for the
time expended in this application, that is a matter for him, but if he does
then it can be taken up
there.  However, it is perfectly proper that the costs
of the filing fees and at least the costs of preparing the affidavits are
a
proper charge to be borne by the estate.  
<P>

16	Accordingly I will make orders 1 and 2 as asked in the summons and further
order that the costs of this application assessed
at $650 be paid out of the
estate to the plaintiff.
<P>
