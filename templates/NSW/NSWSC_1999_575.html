<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>MONDAY 24 MAY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1044/99 - PEARSON'S PRODUCTS PTY LTD V C P TECHNOLOGIES PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b> This is an application to set aside a statutory
demand.
<P>

2	The demand dated 22 December 1998 was in respect of the sum of $51,195.78.
The affidavit accompanying the demand referred to a
deed of 24 November 1998,
pursuant to which the alleged debt was owing.
<P>

3	The plaintiff by its solicitor replied to the demand on 24 December 1998.
Essentially the reply was that the debt arose out of
the purchase of a product
called "Wrinkle Free".  That product was supposed to be able to be sprayed on
to clothes and would produce
the same effect as if the clothes had been ironed.
It was packed in a spray can. Unfortunately, tests after about 9 December 1998
showed that the product had so corroded the can that if anyone sprayed the
product on to a garment, the garment, rather than being
quasi ironed, would in
fact be stained.
<P>

4	The plaintiff then had the product removed from Woolworths and Franklins and
other supermarkets which had stocked it.  It says
that it has lost the value of
the product, it has had to pay for promotion of the product which was wasted,
and it has had to pay
some costs in connection with the removal of the product
from the supermarket shelves.  The claim that it makes is in the vicinity
of
$130,000.
<P>

5	On 29 December 1998 a creditor said that it would insist on the demand and
any claim should be made in the usual way.  The present
proceedings were
commenced on 11 January 1999.
<P>

6	The deed on which the defendant relies is a very peculiar one.  It is a
tripartite deed between the defendant, the plaintiff and
the ANZ Bank.  It
would seem that the ANZ Bank had some claim to have had a fixed charge over the
product which was delivered to
the plaintiff, and the deed provided that the
bank would be paid just short of $20,000, it would join in a document whereby
the plaintiff
was assured that it had title to the product, and the debt for
the purchase price was acknowledged.  Clauses 2.1, 2.2 and 6 of the
deed are as
follows:
<P>

"2.1  In consideration of the Stock Purchase Price, the Company hereby agrees
to sell and Pearsons hereby agrees to purchase the
Stock.
<P>

2.2   Pearsons acknowledges that it has inspected the Stock and neither the
Company nor the Liquidator nor ANZ warrants nor makes
any representation as to
the existence, condition, merchantability, saleability, quality or suitability
for purpose of the Stock.
<P>

6.  <b> The Debt</b>
<P>

 Pearsons acknowledges it owes the Debt to the Company, and hereby agrees to
pay the Debt to the Company and the Liquidator in accordance
with the Third
Schedule.  In consideration of the Company entering into this Deed and the
Liquidator releasing any claim to the Intellectual
Property, in the event that,
for any reason, Pearsons fails to make any one or more of the payments listed
in the Third Schedule
to the Liquidator on or before their respective due date,
Pearsons hereby irrevocably consents to, and the Company shall be immediately
entitled to file for and obtain judgment in the amount of the Debt, or the
balance of the Debt owing at the time of such default.
 The Company may plead
this Deed in support of such consent judgment."
<P>

7	The Third Schedule to the deed provided that $10,000 of the debt would be
paid on the first days of each month for the period
December 1998 to May 1999,
with the odd $1,195.78 being paid on the last mentioned date.  Although the
payment of $19,500 was made
to the ANZ Bank, the payment due on 1 December was
not made and none has been made since.
<P>

8	A minor question arises as to what was due and payable on 22 December 1998.
Mr Pritchard for the defendant says that it was the
full $51,195.78 because
there had been a default of the payment due on 1 December.   That entitled the
defendant "to file for and
obtain judgment in the amount of the Debt" and that
filing for and obtaining judgment were merely procedural matters, indicating
that the amount of the debt was owing as soon as the defendant was entitled to
file for judgment, whatever those words may mean.
 Presumably they mean "to
sue".
<P>

9	Mr Wright for the plaintiff says that the debt was only payable on the dates
mentioned in the Third Schedule.  If it was to be
collected earlier then the
defendant had to perform the preconditions which were set out in the deed,
namely to file for and obtain
judgment.  It had not gone through those
preconditions and, accordingly, the whole of the debt was not payable; all that
was owing
as at 22 December was $10,000.
<P>

10	I consider that of the two Mr Wright is correct. Normally in this sort of
deed one expects a standard clause that if there is
default in any one
instalment the whole of the amount is immediately repayable.  That is starkly
absent.  If parties specify that
amounts are only to be due by a particular
procedure then normally that is the only way in which a debt can be made
payable (see<b> Head v Kelk</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2063%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 63 SR (NSW) 340</a>, 345).
<P>

11	However, all this would really mean would be that the demand might be bad,
but a fresh demand could issue tomorrow, so it is
necessary to deal with the
main point in the dispute.
<P>

12	The facts reduced to their simplest, and making various assumptions, which
at least at this stage of the litigation are warranted,
are that by deed the
plaintiff now owes the defendant $51,195.78.  Against this, the plaintiff has
an unliquidated claim against
the defendant of perhaps $130,000.
<P>

13	The defendant went into administration on 3 July 1998  and the creditors
passed a resolution to wind up the company under s 439C
of the Corporations Law
on 13 October 1998.  The effect of that was that the administrator became the
liquidator and the liquidation
was deemed to have commenced on 3 July 1998.
<P>

14	Before 3 July 1998 the defendant had supplied a quantity of product "Mould
Kill", but the first supply of "Wrinkle Free" occurred
at least on or after 27
July 1998, after the notional date for winding up.  Fourteen thousand eight
hundred thirty-two cans, being
the bulk, was supplied on 20 October 1998.  It
would thus appear that the claim for defective product or breach of warranty
under
the Trade Practices Act or any tortious claim arising out of the supply
arose after the commencement of the winding up.
<P>

15	The defendant's claim also arose after the winding up commenced.  Mr
Pritchard says that this is being too technical.  The plaintiff
owed money to
the defendant before the deed of 24 November 1998, but on 24 November any
liability was translated into a specialty
debt, so that the present claim of
the defendant arose after the commencement of the winding up.
<P>

16	Under s 553 of the Corporations Law the claims against the company are
provable as at the commencement of the winding up.  Under
s 553C mutual
credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings between the company and another
are considered as at that date and set-off.
 One of the principal arguments for
the defendant is that as this case does not involve a s 553C scenario  there is
not an off-setting
claim within the meaning of s 459H of the Corporations Law.
Accordingly, it does not matter what the plaintiff's claim is, it does
not
qualify for an excuse for setting aside the statutory demand.
<P>

17	Corporations Law s 553C which has been relied on in this case is, to my
mind, a red herring.  It is the draftperson's attempt
to translate <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 86</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a> into the field of corporations law.  In the bankruptcy
situation a claim that is made after the commencement of the bankruptcy against
the trustee is a claim against the trustee personally and cannot be set-off
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 86</a>;  see eg <b>Alloway v Steere</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2010%20QBD%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 10 QBD 22</a> and the other
cases referred to in para [86.1.15] of McDonald Henry and Meek's <b>Australian
Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice </b>(LBC, Sydney, 1996).
<P>

18	Under the Corporations Law the liquidator has no personal liability, so
those cases cannot be translated directly across.  However,
it would seem that
the answer is that ordinarily the claim will be a claim against the company for
payment which will be made under
s 556(1)(a) of the Corporations Law.  I say
"ordinarily" because there may be some situations where the liquidator has
acted ultra
vires.
<P>

19	"Off-setting claims" is defined in s 459H (5) of the Corporations Law as:
<P>

"A genuine claim that the company has against the respondent by way of
counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand (even if it does not
arise out of the
same transaction or circumstances as a debt to which the demand relates)".
<P>

20	That definition was considered by the Full Federal Court in<b> John Shearer
Ltd v Gehl Company</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1789.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1789</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2060%20FCR%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 60 FCR 136.</a>  At 142 the three judges said that
the word "cross-demand" is a word of considerable width.  They pointed out it
was not a technical
term and said it should not be given too restricted a
meaning.  Heerey J applied that line of reasoning in the subsequent case of<b>
EquusCorp Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/468.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 468</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20ACSR%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 ACSR 194</a>, 203.
<P>

21	There are arguments the other way, as were well put by Mr Pritchard.  Those
Federal Court decisions are also perhaps inconsistent
with some previous State
authorities, which were not referred to, and, indeed, Robson's <b>Annotated
Corporations Law</b> (LBC, Sydney) is bold enough to say that the Federal Court
decisions are wrong (see 1999 edition page 501).  
<P>

22	However, this Court should in Corporations Law matters follow the decision
of a Full Federal Court.  I have no problem in doing
so here, especially as the
decision reached in that court accords with the way I would, in any event,
construe the definition.  I
hold that there does not have to be a set-off under
s 553C in order for there to be an off-setting claim.
<P>

23	What then is the relationship, if any, between the plaintiff's claim and the
defendant's claim?  Mr Wright puts that the plaintiff's
claim is one which
arose after liquidation.  He points to the decision of the English Court of
Appeal in<b> Re National Arms and Ammunition Co</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%2028%20Ch%20D%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1885) 28 Ch D 474</a>, 479-480
where Bowen LJ said:
<P>

"A broad line is to be drawn between obligations which have accrued before the
commencement of the winding-up and those which accrue
after the commencement of
the winding-up.  Persons who have claims that accrue due before the winding-up
must come in as creditors
pari passu.  But on principle there is no reason why
a debt properly incurred by the liquidator after the commencement of the
winding-up
should not be paid in full ... ".
<P>

24	Accordingly, prima facie the plaintiff is entitled to be paid its claim in
full out of the assets of the defendant.  One can
speculate as to whether those
assets will be sufficient, but Mr Wright has found some comfort in
correspondence that strongly suggests
that the defendant company is insured
against this particular liability.
<P>

25	On the other hand, there would be no reason why as at the date after 1 May
1999 the amount of $51,195.78 should not be paid.
<P>

26	Where that contest takes place really does not concern me.  The court,
provided not too much court time is being used, is quite
content to settle
these disputes without people having to go through the normal processes of the
District Court, but otherwise there
would have to be a claim and cross-claim
filed in the District Court after the appropriate leave was given under s
500(2) of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

27	The scheme of the Corporations Law is that if it is clear that a corporation
owes money to a creditor, then within a very short
period of time the court
should see that no expense has to be incurred by the creditor in recovering
that amount and that undue technicalities
are not put in the way of
recovery.
<P>

28	Accordingly, the procedure has been devised of a statutory demand and a
quick setting aside of the statutory demand.  There will
be cases under s 459H
where the court can see that that is not the appropriate procedure, in which
case the parties are put back
into the position of normal litigants who have to
have their claim litigated in the normal course.
<P>

29	In my view, in the instant case there is an off-setting demand.  The
off-setting demand may have a value of $130,000, that is
the sort of amount
claimed, and seems within the ballpark.  This exceeds either the $10,000 or
$51,000 claimed on the other side
and, accordingly, in my view, the statutory
demand should be set aside.
<P>

30	I hope the parties can deal with the matter commercially without the
winding-up threat  hanging over the plaintiff.  
<P>

31	As the defendant has been unsuccessful the defendant should pay the
plaintiff's cost of the proceedings.
<P>

 	(Mr Wright sought costs on the indemnity basis)
<P>

32	I reserve further consideration both as to the question as to whether costs
should be on the indemnity basis and whether the
liquidator should file a
cross-claim for judicial advice or otherwise.
<P>

 
<P>

                                          oOo
