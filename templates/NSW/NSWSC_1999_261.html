<b>JUDGMENT  (On claim for privilege on document produced in answer to
NP6<i>)</i></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   On 26 February 1999 Mr Ian Robert Angus swore an affidavit
which was filed in court on 22 March 1999. On 18 March
1999 a Notice to
Produce, identified as NP6, was delivered by the solicitors for the plaintiff
to the solicitors for the defendant.
A call was made upon that Notice to
Produce on 22 March and was stood over to 23 March. The defendant's response to
that call was
set out at lines 25 to 45 at page 481 of the transcript.
<P>

2	A document has been produced in answer to the Notice. The position in
relation to the document produced is that on its face (1)
it is a photocopy,
(2) it is clear, and it is acknowledged to be the case, that other parts of the
same physical document have been
obliterated to produce the produced
photocopy.
<P>

3	In respect of the obliterated parts of the document, the photocopy produced
bears the endorsement: "<i>Remainder of document marked '- irrelevant'</i>". If
that was the basis upon which it was sought to preclude inspection by the
plaintiff of the document, the defendant would be
in difficulty. The question
of relevance in the absence of any other claim by way of privilege would only
arise upon the deployment
as evidence of the document if ever that took place.
It is a claim for privilege that the defendant makes to protect the balance
of
the document.
<P>

4	For the plaintiff it is contended that a claim for privilege having initially
been made and waived to the extent that the photocopy
has been produced, the
question arises, and I will say either at common law or under s 126 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> as to whether or not there are circumstances requiring the
production of the balance on any basis of fairness at common law or in
terms of
s 126 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> "<i>to enable a proper understanding of the
document."</i>
<P>

5	For this purpose I have inspected the original of the whole document and a
transcription of it to make it legible prepared in
court this morning. I have
been referred to Justice Sackville's decision in<b> <i>Towney v Minister for
Land and Water Conservation</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2076%20FCR%20401" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 76 FCR 401</a>, particularly his
Honour's observations in respect of s 126 at page 414B to E and to the decision
of Justice Lehane in<b> <i>Hammer and Others v Sunman and Another</i></b><i>
</i>(unreported) 2 October 1998.  I take into account each of their Honour's
observations in relation to the particular of application
with which he was
concerned.
<P>

6	The conclusion to which I have come, having read the balance of the document
in respect of which privilege is claimed, and I find
properly claimed, is that
there is no necessity for the proper understanding of the communication or
document constituted by the
first part, or no unfairness arising from the
non-disclosure of the second and thus will decline to require the defendant to
produce
anything more than as produced.
<P>

7	I come to this view the more so when when I consider in context that which
has been produced in relation to the affidavit and
the Notice to Produce and
the response to a call made yesterday, and to the transcript reference I have
already referred.
<P>

8	The photocopy produced in exhibited form will be MFI 5.  The original and
transcription will both be MFI 6.
