<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> The Cabbage Tree Hotel, at 73 Princes Highway Fairy
Meadow New South Wales, is the land in Folio Identifier 2/803531 and was leased
by Dylcote Pty Limited the first defendant to Mr John Henry Ferris and others
by lease registered 275736H for a term of twenty years
commencing on 11
November 1991 and terminating on 10 November 2011. The lease restricts the use
of the premises to a licensed hotel
and bottleshop - clause 5.1.  After
intermediate transfer the lease was transferred to the plaintiffs by transfer
2018300 dated 26
February 1996, and they have conducted the hotel business
under the lease since then.  The hotel building was very extensively damaged
as
a result of storms, heavy rain and flooding on 17 August 1998.  The litigation
arises out of a Notice of Termination of the lease
dated 30 November 1998 and
delivered to the lessees on 1 December 1998, and attempts by the second
defendant Mr Hunt, a Commercial
Agent on behalf of the lessor, to eject the
lessees from the hotel early on 2 December 1998.  The lessees contend that the
Notice
of Termination was ineffective, and that they are still entitled to
possession under the lease.  They obtained an interim injunction
and they are
still in possession.  There has been no attempt to put the claim to re-enter on
the basis of breach of covenants of
the lease.
<P>

2	The litigation turns on the effectiveness of the lessor's decision to
terminate and Notice of Termination under clause 3.11 of
the lease.  Clause
3.11 is in these terms:-
<P>

	<i>"If the whole or any part of the Building shall be destroyed or damaged by
fire flood lightning storm tempest or other disabling cause
so as to render the
Demised Premises during the Term substantially unfit for the use and occupation
of the Lessee or so as to render
the rebuilding or reconstruction of the
Building in its previous form impracticable or undesirable, in the opinion of
the Lessor,
then:-</i>
<P>

<i>	"(a)	This lease may be terminated, without </i>
<P>

<i>	compensation, by either the Lessor or the Lessee, by notice in writing to
the other provided always that in the latter case the Lessor
shall have first
failed to rebuild or reinstate the Demised Premises within a reasonable time
after being requested so to do in writing
by the Lessee;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Any such termination shall be without </i>
<P>

<i>	prejudice to the rights of either party in respect of any antecedent breach
of the terms of this Lease;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Nothing herein contained or implied shall </i>
<P>

<i>	be deemed to impose any obligation upon the Lessor to rebuild or reinstate
or make fit for use and occupation the Demised Premises;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	Upon the happening of any such </i>
<P>

<i>	destruction or damage the total yearly rent hereby reserved and the
outgoings payable by the Lessee under Clause 4 of this Lease
or a proportionate
part thereof according to the nature and extent of the damage sustained shall
abate until the Demised Premises
shall have been rebuilt or reinstated or made
fit for use and occupation or until this Lease shall be terminated pursuant to
the
provisions of sub-clause (a) of this Clause as the case may be;  AND</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	In the event of any dispute arising out of </i>
<P>

<i>	the operation of this Clause the same shall be referred to arbitration
under the provisions of the laws for the time being in force
in the State of
New South Wales.</i>
<P>

<i>	Notwithstanding anything in this Clause expressed or implied the Lessee
shall have no such right of termination and rent shall not
abate if the
destruction or damage was caused by the Lessee."</i>
<P>

3	There was reference throughout argument to provisions of the lease relating
to repairs and to insurance, although the Notice of
Termination was not based
on failure to comply with them. Part 6 - Maintenance Repair And Alterations -
provides at 6.1:-
<P>

	<i>"The Lessee will during the Term and otherwise so long as the Lessee may
remain in possession or occupation when where and so often
as need shall be
maintain replace repair and keep the Demised Premises in good and substantial
repair order and condition (having
regard to their condition at he (sic)
commencement of the Lease) damage by explosion, earthquake, aircraft, riot,
civil commotion,
fire, flood, lightning, storm, tempest and reasonable wear and
tear, act of God and war damage only excepted unless any insurance
moneys are
irrecoverable through the neglect default or misconduct of the Lessee.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	This covenant shall not impose on the Lessee any obligation in respect of
any structural maintenance replacement or repair except
when the same is
rendered necessary by any act neglect default or omission on the part of the
Lessee or by the Lessee's use or occupancy
of the Demised Premises.  The Lessee
acknowledges that the Demised Premises were in good and substantial repair
order and condition
at the commencement of the Term."</i>
<P>

4	There are elaborate provisions relating to insurance under which the lessees
are obliged to have insurance against a number of
risks, and the insurance is
to be for the protection of the lessor, who has some controls over the
insurance and also rights to information.
 Clause 8.1 (c) is part of those
provisions, and provides:-
<P>

	<i>"The Lessee will insure and keep insured at all times the Demised Premises
against loss or damage by fire, storm, tempest, flood and
such other risks as
the Lessor shall require in the names of the Lessee and the Lessor for the full
insurable value of the Demised
Premises (and if required by the Lessor in the
Demised Premises full reinstatement value) such insurance to be with an
insurance
office approved by the Lessor AND the Lessee will hand the policy or
policies evidencing such insurance and all receipts for premiums
paid and other
usual evidence of insurance to the Lessor upon the issue thereof and the Lessee
will pay all premiums in respect of
all such policy or policies and renewals
thereof as and when same fall due and the Lessee shall not permit or make any
exclusions
endorsements or alterations to such policy or policies unless first
approved in writing by the Lessor."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The lessees had various insurances over their business.  The lessees
had Storm and Tempest insurance in effect on 17 August 1998 but
did not then or
at the time of the hearing have insurance against Flood.
<P>

5	The lessees continued the kinds of insurance which their predecessor lessees
had had.  Exhibit E is a certificate issued by Citylink
Insurance Brokers
recording terms of their insurance with Lloyds Insurers;  the insurance was in
various classes including <i>"Fire and Extraneous Perils excluding flood"</i>
but there was no insurance for the class <i>"Flood"</i>. The lessees did not
propose for insurance under the class <i>"Flood"</i>.  The Fire and Extraneous
Perils insurance extends among other things to loss, destruction or damage of
the building as a result
of events of storm tempest or rainwater, excluding
flood;  but <i>"flood"</i> has a defined meaning.  Some things which would
ordinarily be called <i>"flood"</i> are not excluded and in particular
<i>"inundation by...run-off surface water from surrounding areas"</i> is not
excluded, while flood caused by a sudden rise of Cabbage Tree Creek is probably
excluded.
<P>

6	The question whether the lessees failed to comply with the covenant relating
to flood insurance is not directly in issue and cannot
be decided in this case,
and the same is true of the question whether that failure has actually caused
loss.  The availability of
insurance and the question whether damage to the
hotel was covered by the insurance against Storm and Tempest depend on detailed
facts relating to the source of the water which flooded the hotel.  Those facts
have not been examined in the evidence, and are still
under claim to the
insurers, and the answer to the question whether there is  entitlement to
indemnity is not obvious or easy.  The
terms of the lease give the impression
that the lessees should have done more, but the lessor has not claimed
possession on the footing
of a breach of that covenant and it is not necessary
to decide whether there was a breach, or whether any breach caused loss.  The
absence of Flood insurance was referred to a number of times in the hearing but
I do not think that it is of direct importance, except
that events would
probably have gone differently if there had been Flood insurance.  The lessor
was entitled to know, and did know
before 17 August 1998, particulars of the
insurance which the lessees had obtained;  but in my opinion that does not
alter the lessees'
obligation under the covenant.
<P>

7	A number of times during the hearing observations were made and questions
were framed by lessees' counsel which assumed or asserted
that under the lease
the lessor was obliged to maintain the structure of the hotel.  In my opinion
the lease does not create any
such obligation. The exception to clause 6.1
establishes that the lessee is not under any obligation in respect of
structural repair
and creates no implication that the lessor is under an
obligation in respect of structural repair.  In my opinion the effect of Part
6
is that either the lessor or the lessee may carry out structural repair as
thought fit but neither is obliged to do so.
<P>

8	The terms of clause 3.11 present several difficulties for understanding it.
One difficulty is to understand what matters are to
be established by the
opinion of the lessor.  The first passage of clause 3.11 is open to the reading
that some or all of the circumstances
in which termination or abatement of rent
or other action under sub-paragraphs (a) to (e) is to happen are to be
established only
if the lessor forms an opinion on them.  On the widest reading
the lessor's opinion may be necessary to establish whether the building
is
destroyed or damaged, whether it is destroyed or damaged by a disabling cause,
whether the demised premises have been rendered
substantially unfit for use and
occupation of the lessee, whether destruction or damage has rendered rebuilding
or reconstruction
of the building in its previous form impracticable, and
whether the destruction or damage has rendered rebuilding of the building
in
its previous form undesirable.  The arrangement of ideas and expressions in the
opening part of clause 3.11 and the punctuation
are not of any real use in
determining whether the opinion is to be the means of establishing all of these
things or only the last
of them, that is the question whether rebuilding or
reconstruction is undesirable.
<P>

9	It is very unlikely that it was intended that all of these things were to
have some effect only if established in the opinion
of the lessor, because the
later sub-clauses confer rights on the lessee and it is very unlikely that
those rights were only to exist
and be available against the lessor if the
lessor had first formed and expressed an opinion which the lessee could act on;
that would
make it unlikely that the lessee would ever get any practical
benefit.  All the factual tests in the opening passage are capable
of being
established objectively - destroyed, damaged, disabling cause, substantially
unfit, impracticable, except the last - undesirable,
which unlike the others is
a matter for opinion.  My view is that the matter which is to be determined
according to the opinion of
the lessor is only the matter mentioned immediately
before the opinion was introduced, that is the question whether destruction or
damage rendered rebuilding or reconstruction undesirable.
<P>

10	The tests mentioned in the opening part of clause 3.11 can be satisfied in a
widely different range of circumstances.  For example
a part of the building
might be damaged so as to render the demised premises substantially unfit for
use and occupation during a
short part of the term, and that would present
different considerations about whether the lease ought to be terminated or
whether
the rent ought to abate to those presented by other circumstances in
which the whole building was completely destroyed.  Clause 3.11
would work in a
very strange way if either party could terminate the lease and bring the rights
and obligations of the other party
to an end without compensation on the
happening of an event which made the premises unfit for use and occupation only
for a short
time and led to a small abatement of rent.
<P>

11	In my view the meaning of clause 3.11 must be understood with an implied
limitation which the words used allow and without which
the power to terminate
could operate very unjustly.  Unless there is an implied limitation there are
no means to bring it about that
termination without compensation is
appropriately proportional to the difficulty created by the destruction or
damage.  An implied
limitation of this kind is indicated and assumed by the
mechanism in sub-clauses (a) and (e) in which one party may terminate the
lease
in the circumstances stated by notice in writing to the other, but in the event
of any dispute the dispute is to be referred
to arbitration.  The matters which
may be disputed are not only the factual matters - whether the building has
been destroyed or
damaged, whether the demised premises have been rendered
substantially unfit for use and occupation, whether rebuilding or
reconstruction
is impracticable and so forth, but also the question whether
termination without compensation is appropriate, which may be determined
by a
notice given by either party but if disputed is to be determined by an
arbitrator.
<P>

12	My view on the approach I should take to implication is based on the
approach in the Court of Appeal in <i>Renard Constructions Pty Ltd v Minister
of Public Works</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 234</a> to the contractual provisions there
under consideration and their Honours' receptivity to ad hoc implications of
obligations of reasonableness.
 The relevant provisions of clause 3.11 differ
markedly from those provisions, but there are some similar elements in the
manner
in which they work.  The provisions of clause 3.11 which refer to the
lessor's opinion and the power of either party to terminate
are mechanisms
ancillary to the overall purposes of the parties' agreement and exist to
achieve those purposes;  they are not there
so as to enable the party forming
the opinion or deciding on termination to grasp an advantage for itself, and
the implication of
reasonableness, which is readily made, is required to be
made and governs those steps. Such implications are made readily;  see
<i>Hughes Brothers Pty Ltd v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
31 NSWLR 91</a>, <i>Alcatel Australia Limited v Scarcella</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 483</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 349.</a>
The purposes of the parties' leasehold relationship at large furnish context
within which the reasonableness of a decision is to
be evaluated.
<P>

13	Handley JA in <i>Renard</i> at 280-283 collected and reviewed case law in
which provisions for reference of disputes to arbitration after decisions to
the satisfaction
or in the discretion of a party have been held to place the
arbitrator in the position of hearing an appeal from the party's decision
or
discretion.  The structure of clause 3.11 leads me to the view that the dispute
which may be referred to arbitration may relate
to any element of clause 3.11,
whether a matter or fact, an opinion or a decision of a party.  In clause 3.11
the opinion of the
lessor or the decision of a party to terminate is, in my
opinion, no more than provisional and the machinery for arbitration of a
dispute is just as much a part of the mechanism for producing a decision as is
the machinery for provisional decision by a party.
<P>

14	The purposes of the lease overall appear to me to require that termination
should not follow automatically from damage and at
the option of either party:
there must be an implication that termination would only happen if the damage
was such as to make termination
appropriate, and there must be an implication
that the dispute and arbitration mechanism would extend to reconsidering any
decision
by a party bearing on termination.  Otherwise the lease would be
futile, liable to be defeated by either party in relatively slight
circumstances.  It would lack business efficacy as a lease for 20 years.
<P>

15	It could very well be that an abatement of part (or even all) of the rent
might be appropriate for some period yet termination
without compensation of
the entire lease relationship might be inappropriate;  and if there was a
dispute about this the parties
agreed to be bound by what an arbitrator might
decide.
<P>

16	In my opinion it is an implied obligation of the lessor to act reasonably in
forming an opinion on the undesirability of reconstruction,
and it is an
implied obligation of each party to act reasonably in terminating the lease.
Unless facts objectively exist in which
it is reasonable to conclude that
reconstruction is undesirable, an opinion that it was undesirable would not
have any contractual
effect.  In an endeavour to articulate what is required by
the test of reasonableness when it is to be applied to a decision to terminate
under the lease, I will say that it requires proportionality between the
outcome of termination without compensation and the nature
of the underlying
problem.
<P>

17	I do not accept the contention made on behalf of the lessor to the effect
that by asserting a right to an abatement of rent to
which the lessee was
plainly entitled in the circumstances, and which the lessor did not dispute,
the lessee has established, or
is estopped from denying that facts exist on
which a termination may be grounded.  The contention was based on an
incorrectly simple
view of the wide range of circumstances in which there might
be abatement, and in which there might be a termination of the lease.
<P>

18	The reference to termination being effected by a notice in writing should
also in my opinion be understood by reference to the
available mechanism for
dispute and arbitration.  First there is a need for a period of notice to
attend to practicalities of bringing
the relationship to an end, for which the
need for a reasonable period of time is obvious, as is illustrated by the need
of a lessee
to wind up business in an orderly way and arrange for transfer of
the licence.  Secondly there is a need for a period of notice to
establish
whether there is any dispute and to set an arbitration in motion if there is.
The course taken by the lessor in this case
was to give the notice on 1
December, not specifying any period of notice, and then to re-enter the
premises early in the morning
of 2 December.  Only nominally was there a period
of notice at all;  in substance, no notice was given, as no opportunity was
given
either to act on the Notice of Termination by winding up the business, or
to act on it in any other way, such as by setting the arbitration
machinery in
motion.  The lack of a reasonable period of notice, in substance the lack of
any notice at all, is in my opinion a reason
sufficient of itself why the
Notice of Termination was not effective.
<P>

19	Lord Devlin speaking for the Judicial Committee in <i>Australian Blue Metal
Limited v Hughes</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] AC 74</a> at 98 said:-
<P>

	<i>"...it does not require very much to induce a Court to read into an
agreement of a commercial character, either by construction or
by implication,
a provision that the arrangements between the parties, whatever they may be,
shall be terminable only on reasonable
notice."</i>
<P>

20	This observation was not applied by their Lordships in that case, but in my
opinion it is clearly applicable to the present case,
where in the
circumstances stated the lease is terminable on notice;  clause 3.11 specifies
that there is to be notice, and does
not specify how long it is to be.
<P>

21	I take it that the basis of their Lordships' observation at 98 is the case
law referred to at 102, particularly <i>Wintergarden Theatre (London) Ltd v
Millennium Productions Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%20AC%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] AC 173</a> at 199 and 205 and <i>Tool Metal
Manufacturing Co Ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd [</i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1955/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1955%5d%201%20WLR%20761" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1955] 1 WLR 761</a> at 765.
The implication would require a notice of a reasonable time;  it would not
require a dated notice which specified the time
when it was to expire, although
that would be convenient, but it would be necessary that the notice should
indicate that it was to
operate in the future, and it would be necessary that a
reasonable time should elapse between giving the notice and putting it in
to
effect.  McHugh JA stated the effect of case law in this field in <i>Crawford
Fitting Co and Ors v Sydney Valve and Fittings Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 438</a>
at 444;  see too Clarke JA at 454.
<P>

22	The alternative to a construction in which there is to be a reasonable
period of notice is a construction in which a notice in
writing is to be given
but it is not required to be a notice for any length of time and can operate
immediately.  It is difficult
to suppose that the parties can have intended to
agree in those terms, in which the delivery of a document as a notice serves so
little function that is hard to see why it would be required;  re-entry would
be enough.  That reading would be difficult to reconcile
with the use of the
word <i>"notice"</i> to refer to the document, although not entirely
inconsistent;  it is conceivable that a notice could operate immediately on
delivery,
although that is not the most usual meaning of expressions which
include the word <i>"notice"</i>.
<P>

23	In fact however the lessees' solicitor within the extreme limitations
imposed by the course taken by the lessor did indicate
on 1 December that the
termination was disputed, and in my opinion the consequence of this event
pointed out by the terms of clause
3.11 was that the provision relating to
arbitration was to be acted on and no other action under the Notice of
Termination was available.
<P>

24	In my opinion the provisions of clause 3.11 did not in the circumstances
entitle the lessor to re-enter the premises on 2 December
1998, because the
dispute had not been arbitrated and also because, even if there had not been
any dispute, there had not been reasonable
notice.
<P>

25	The lessees' counsel put forward for consideration some issues which I do
not regard as ultimately determinative, in view of
what I have said about the
operation of clause 3.11.  One was a contention to the effect that the lessor
had not acted reasonably
and in good faith in forming the opinion upon which
the purported Notice of Termination expressed itself to be based.  I do not
regard
this question as determinative because of my view of the operation of
clause 3.11 in which the opinion if formed and the decision
to terminate are
both open to dispute and in case of dispute the effective decisions on both
subjects are to be made by the arbitrator.
<P>

26	I state my opinion that the lessee acted reasonably and in good faith in
deciding to terminate upon the material upon which the
lessee acted, that is
the report of Mr Madden, which if accepted in its entirety does provide a basis
upon which a reasonable person
could form the opinion that reconstruction of
the building in its previous form is undesirable.  Notwithstanding the
consideration
which Mr Courtney on behalf of the lessor had given to possibly
entering into a different hotel venture in Fairy Meadow, I would
not find that
he acted unreasonably or without observing good faith in forming his opinion,
if his action is tested only by reference
to the material which he considered.
He did not act for any improper purpose or any purpose extraneous to the
purposes of clause
3.11 in deciding to issue a Notice of Termination.  I say
this because the consideration which had been given to disposing of the
property after demolition or turning it to account, and to entering into
another hotel venture with other persons, had not proceeded
very far, and in
any event the fact that Mr Courtney turned his mind to those questions does not
establish a lack of good faith,
as there is no unrealistic requirement that the
party acting under clause 3.11 should act with indifference to the party's own
interests.
<P>

27	However the effectiveness of a termination and the question whether
reconstruction is undesirable are not finally decided according
to the opinion
of the lessor, and there is a very considerable body of material to be set
against Mr Madden's opinions about the
stability of the structure upon which a
quite different conclusion could be based.  An arbitrator deciding the dispute
would have
to have regard to the report of Mr Anderson, a builder who prepared
a report on the Cabbage Tree Hotel on 23 April 1993, and that
report would show
that many of the processes of deterioration and decay which Mr Madden noted
were already present in the building
before 17 August 1998 and that their
presence was not inconsistent with fitness of the demised premises for use and
occupation and
did not make rebuilding or reconstruction necessary;  they were
in no way inconsistent with carrying on business, to the standard
at which it
was being carried on before that day, and they set an important part of the
context for any decision about whether, in
effect, the building and the lease
ought to be written off and all rights and obligations of the lessor or the
lessee brought to
an end.
<P>

28	It would also be necessary to have regard to the observations and the views
of Mr D R Sherson, who reported on inspections of
the hotel which he made in
December 1998 and whose report was in evidence.  Although Mr Madden's
observations were very detailed
and fully and clearly expressed, and appear to
have been well considered, they are by no means the last word on the subject,
and
the lesson of experience is that hotel business can be carried on in the
premises for years on end while the premises are in a very
deteriorated state.
The right answer to this conflict can only be known when the conflict is
resolved by the means pointed out by
clause 3.11, that is to say by
arbitration.
<P>

29	The lessees' counsel also contended that the lessor is estopped by its
conduct from relying on its power of termination;  the
contention was  to the
effect that the lessor's conduct from 17 August to 30 November 1998 and in
particular its giving no indication
that the lease would be terminated, while
it was known and obvious that the lessees were engaged in some works of
restoration, in
some way brings about the result that there is an estoppel.  As
is very common with contentions in which estoppel is invoked the
factual basis
for an estoppel was not well elucidated.  In my view there is no estoppel
because the conduct of the lessee could not
be said to have clearly had the
effect of representing to the lessee or giving the lessee to understand that
the power of termination
would not be exercised;  there was simply no
communication on that subject either way.  Further there is no real basis for
thinking
that the lessees' conduct was influenced by conduct of the lessor;
that is to say no basis for thinking that but for some such representation
as
must be supposed the lessees would not have bothered with the works of
restoration which they did engage in.  Quite to the contrary
the modest work
which the lessees undertook is well explicable by attention to their own
interests, without reference to any representation
imputed to the lessor.  In
my view there was no estoppel.
<P>

30	For the reasons stated I am of the view that the Notice of Termination did
not have the effect of entitling the lessor to re-enter
the premises and I will
make orders and declarations to that effect.  The parties should remain in
their present position, with the
lessees in possession under the lease for the
balance of the term unless and until a decision for termination is obtained on
arbitration.
