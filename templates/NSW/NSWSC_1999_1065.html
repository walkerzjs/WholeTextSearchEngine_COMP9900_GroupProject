<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER:.  This is the hearing of an application brought for
construction of a will of the late John Smyth. It is probably convenient
to
firstly mention the beneficiaries who take under that will in order to put into
context the matters that I have to deal with later.
<P>

2  	     The will was made on 4 September 1990.  Iolanda Hoare, who I
will refer to as Iolanda, is the second defendant. She is
the plaintiff in
other proceedings which are before me for hearing in which she seeks an order
under the Family Provisions Act. She
in these proceedings deposes to the fact
that she lived with the deceased in a de facto relationship which commenced in
the mid to
late 1960s and continued up until the time the deceased was admitted
to hospital in 1990.
<P>

3  	Yvonne Hoare, who I will refer to as Yvonne, is the third
defendant.  She is the daughter of Iolanda.  She is not suggesting
that she is
a member of the deceased household or dependant upon the deceased.
<P>

4  	Isabella Hoare, who  I will refer to as Isabella, is the first
defendant. In the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> proceedings she deposes to the fact that
she and the deceased lived in a de facto relationship from a period commencing
about May
1989 up until the deceased's death.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff in the proceedings, Edward George Dubois, is the
executor of the will.  He was also a friend the deceased, having
met him in
November 1986 when he and the deceased operated businesses in adjoining joining
premises.
<P>

6  	Tony Drieman, who I will refer to as Mr Drieman, was a friend of
the deceased. He rented a property known as 34 Pacific Highway,
Mooney Mooney
from the deceased prior to the death of the deceased.   Mr Drieman survived the
deceased but died himself on 6 June,
1997.
<P>

7  	The fourth defendant is the executor of the last will of Mr
Drieman and is the beneficiary under that will of any estate or
interest which
Drieman is found to have had as at the date of his death in the Mooney Mooney
property.
<P>

8  	Alexander Filby is the half brother of the deceased. He is not a
party to the proceedings but Mr Filby and the deceased, until
the death of Mr
Filby on 13 May 1989 were the owners as joint tenants of a property known as 7
Walker Place, Church Point (the Church
Point property) and certain shares and
money on deposit.
<P>

9  	As I mentioned, he predeceased the deceased and some of the
assets which were jointly owned with the deceased passed to him
by virtue of
survivorship.  There were other assets  which he had with Mr Filby and those
assets pass to the deceased.
<P>

10  	No application for probate of Mr Filby's will was made by the
deceased in his lifetime and the plaintiff, as the legal representative
of the
deceased, obtained  a grant of probate of Mr Filby's will upon the death of the
deceased.
<P>

11  	I will mention for the record, because it will be useful, the
assets of the deceased at the date of death. He owned a number
of pieces of
real estate, namely, 7 Walker Place,  Church Point.  That is the jointly owned
property to which I have referred.  There
is the property at 34 Pacific
Highway, Mooney Mooney to which I have also referred. Another property was 7
Helen Street, Sefton,
to which I shall refer as the Helen Street property.
There was also 42, 44, 46 and 48 Neill Street, Harden, known as the Harden
shops.
He held a property at 146 Neill Street, Murrumburrah and another one at
27 Neill Street, Harden.  Two other properties were held.
One was 96 Waldron
Road, Chester Hill and another at 344 Albury Street, Murrumburrah.
<P>

12  	He had money on deposit of some $15,000 and  shares in companies
of just under $30,000.  He had two motor vehicles and an interest
in the estate
of his stepbrother, Mr Filby.
<P>

13  	The will in respect of which these proceedings have been
commenced is one which was drawn by the deceased. Some of the provisions
are
easily understood.  Accordingly under the will it is clear that the Helen
Street property and all the possessions in this pass
to Isabella.  The
Murrumburrah Post Office property and its contents pass to Isabella as do the
Toyota motor vehicle and the picture
framing machinery in the Waldron Road
property.
<P>

14  	The Church Point property and it its contents was left to
Isabella and Yvonne in equal shares as tenants in common. The Harden
Shop
properties, 27 Neill Street and 147 Neill Street were all left to Iolanda.
<P>

15  	The Waldron Road property was held on trust for the plaintiff
during  Isabella's life with rentals during that time to be paid
to Isabella.
The remainder passes to the plaintiff.
<P>

16  	The other provisions in the will are not that clear and I will
deal now with the outstanding matters which will require the
court to form a
view as to the appropriate construction of the will.
<P>

17  	The will of the deceased is three pages long and the last
paragraph of the will provides as follows:
<P>

"Any assets or property not bequeathed by the above bequests to be bequeathed
to Yvonne Hoare" 
<P>

18  	In my view, that clearly is a residuary clause giving residue to
Yvonne Hoare. It is not necessary for a residuary gift to
use the word,
"residuary" and in particular, having regard to the position of the clause in
the deceased's will, it clearly is a
residuary bequest.
<P>

19  	The next matter that has to be dealt with is a provision in the
will which has been referred to as the renovation fund provision.
 The
deceased's will contained the following provision: 
<P>

All shares are to be held or sold at the executor's discretion together with
cash in various accounts to be held  in trust by the
executor to be used in the
repair and renovation and improvement of (the Church Point property)".
<P>

     
<P>

20  	Prior to that there was the bequest of the Church Point property
to Yvonne and Isabella.
<P>

21  	The first question to be determined in respect of that provision
is what is comprised within the fund. Assets which the deceased
had which may
possibly fall within it are the monies on deposit of $15,599.77, shares in
companies of $29,773.75 and the deceased's
interest as a beneficiary in the
Filby estate.
<P>

22  	The first two items of property I have mentioned do include the
shares and moneys which were jointly owned between the deceased
and Mr Filby.
Clearly I think they do fall within the provisions as they passed to the
deceased by survivorship.
<P>

23  	The real question is whether the interest in the assets of Mr
Filby in respect of those items of property which were left by
Mr Filby is also
included within the fund.  As I have mentioned, no probate was taken out before
the death of the deceased. It would
seem to me that the interest of the
deceased was merely that of a beneficiary in an unadministered estate.  Such a
beneficiary holds
no interest in any property but has a right which is a chose
in action to the due administration of the estate (see <b>Commissioner for
Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1964/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] UKPC 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20AC%20694" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) AC 694</a> at 717).
<P>

24  	It is also important to bear in mind the provisions of section
20 of the Wills Probate and Administration Act.  They are as
follows:
<P>

"Every will shall be construed with reference to the real and personal estate
comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it
had been made immediately
before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears by the
will."
<P>

25  	As is made clear by the section a will speaks from the date of
death.  Accordingly the subject matter of a gift is determined
by the factual
situation as at the date of death. That is the opposite to the provisions which
apply where one determines the object
of the gift when prima facie the will
speaks from its date.
<P>

26  	In the circumstances, it would seem to me clear, using those
principles, that the interest of the deceased in the estate of
Mr Filby does
not fall within the fund to which I have referred.  Given my finding as to
residuary gift, clearly it then falls into
residue.
<P>

27  	The second problem that arises in relation  to the renovation
fund is the question of what should be done in respect of the
property. At the
date of death, the Church Point property was not in a good situation and it has
deteriorated even further. The principles
which perhaps apply in respect of
this bequest would seem to be the following.
<P>

28  	First, if a gift is of a specified amount and the money is to
benefit the donee in a manner, it is a question of the construction
of the
particular will whether the primary object of the testator was to make a
specified gift to the donee or to have the specified
purpose established. Where
the donee is to have the benefit, the gift takes immediate effect even though
the purpose may be, inter
alia, impossible.  The  donee is entitled to payments
without the purpose being exercised (see <b>Williams on Wills</b>, ibid at
745).
<P>

29  	In the situation which does apply here where a fund is given
without specificity, to a donee for particular purposes for the
benefit of
certain property, the fund belongs to the persons entitled to the property.
<P>

30  	There are two cases in point which illustrate that principle.
One is in <b>re Bowes; Earl of Strathmore v Vane</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281896%29%201%20Ch%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1896) 1 Ch 507</a> and the
other is in <b>re Lipinski's Will </b>Trusts  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1976%201%20Ch%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1976, 1 Ch 235.</a> In the latter case
Oliver J had to deal with a bequest as to one half of an estate for the Hull
Judeans (Maccabi) Association in
memory of his late wife "to be used solely in
constructing and improving the new buildings for the association". The
association
was an unincorporated association.  However, similar problems arise
with the construction with that gift. At page 249, Oliver J discussed
in re
Bowes and the matter before him and had the following to say.
<P>

"Perhaps the most striking in the present context is in re Bowes  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281896%29%201%20Ch%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1896) 1 Ch
507</a>, where money was directed to be laid out in the planting of trees on a
settled estate.  That was a &#180;purpose trust', but there
were ascertainable
beneficiaries, the owners for the time being of the estate; and North J held
that the persons entitled to the
settled estate were entitled to have the money
whether or not it was laid out as directed by the testator.  He says, at
p510:&#180;Then
the sole question is where this money is to go to.  Of course,
it is a perfectly good legacy.  There is nothing illegal in the matter,
and the
direction to plant might easily be carried out; but it is not necessarily
capable of being performed, because the owner of
the estate might say he would
not have any trees planted upon it at all.   If that were the line he took, and
he did not content
for anything more than that, the legacy would fail; but he
says he does not refuse to have trees planted upon it; he is content that
trees
should be planted upon some part of it; but the legacy has not failed.  If it
were necessary to uphold it, the trees can be
 planted upon the whole if it
until the fund is exhausted.  Therefore, there is nothing illegal in the gift
itself; but the owners
of the estate now say: &#180;It is a very
disadvantageous way of spending this money; the money is to be spent for our
benefit and
that of no one else; it was not intended for any purpose other than
our benefit and that of the estate.  That is any purpose other
than our benefit
and that of the estate.  That is no reason why it should be thrown away by
doing what is not for our benefit, instead
of being given to us, who want to
have the enjoyment of it.'  I think their contention is right.  I think the
fund is devoted to
improving the estate, and improving the estate for the
benefit of the persons who are absolutely entitled to it."
<P>

I can see no reason why the same reasoning should not apply in the present case
simply because the beneficiary is an unincorporated
non-charitable association.
I do not think the fact that the testator  has directed the application
&#180;solely' for the specified
purpose adds any legal force to the direction.
The beneficiaries, the members of the association for the time being, are the
persons
who could enforce the purpose and they must, as it seems to me, be
entitled not to  enforce it or, indeed, to vary it.
<P>

Thus it seems to me that whether one treats the gift as a &#180;purpose' trust
or as an absolute gift with a superadded direction
or, on the analogy of in re
Turkington {1937} 4 All ER 501 as a gift where the trustees and the
beneficiaries are the same persons,
all roads lead to the same conclusion. In
my judgment, the gift is a valid gift, and I will answer question 1 of the
summons in sense
(a)."
<P>

31  	I do note that the gift does not expressly impose a condition as
to the use of the fund as a term of taking the bequest. Accordingly,
in my
view, the terms of the provisions of the deceased's will is the creation of a
fund for the benefit of certain property. Accordingly
the funds belonging to
those entitled to the subject property, namely Isabella and Yvonne irrespective
of whether the fund was ever
capable of being used for the purpose of the will.
They can apply or not apply the fund for the purposes specified.
<P>

32  	The next matter which is the one which is probably the most
difficult in the case, concerns the distribution of the Mooney
Mooney property.
The provisions of the deceased's will which relate to the Mooney Mooney
property are in the following terms:
<P>

"I give devise and bequeath unto the executor in trust for Tony Drieman of 34
Pacific Highway, Mooney Mooney, the property known
as 34 Pacific Highway,
Mooney Mooney NSW. Tony Drieman is to pay weekly rental to Isabella Hodgson of
$60 a week indexed to the CPI
plus all council rates and charges and all other
various government charges.  The payment to cease on the death of Isabella
Hodgson
and the property at 34 Pacific Highway, Mooney Mooney is no longer held
in trust by the Executor and becomes the property of Tony
Drieman absolute.
Should Tony Drieman predecease me then the property at 34 Pacific Highway,
Mooney Mooney is bequeathed to Iolanda
Hoar of 9 Torrington Avenue, Sefton, if
alive - else to her daughter Yvonne Hoare."
<P>

33  	As I have mentioned, Mr Drieman survived the deceased but died
on 6 June 1997. He paid no rent in respect of the Mooney Mooney
property
between 6 March 1995 and the date of his death and he was already in arrears at
the time of the last payment.
<P>

34  	The first defendant who is the executor of the will of Mr
Drieman submits that the above provision constituted a valid gift
by Tony
Drieman of the Mooney Mooney property. The contrary is submitted on behalf of
Yvonne, namely that the gift fails and passes
into the residuary estate of the
deceased.
<P>

35  	This is a case where it is appropriate to use the arm chair
principle.  Under the armchair principle, the evidence of the circumstances
surrounding the testator at the date of his will is admissible as an aid in the
construction of the will.
<P>

"You may place yourself, so to speak, in the testator's armchair, and consider
the circumstances by which he was surrounded when
he made his will to assist
you in arriving at this intention."  
<P>

36  	The justification for the armchair principle is that the court
infers that the testator had his own surrounding circumstances.
To quote
Blackburn J in <b>Allgood v Blake</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281873%29%20LR%208%20Exch%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1873) LR 8 Ex 160</a> at 162:
<P>

"The general rule is that, in construing a will, the Court is entitled to put
itself in the position of the testator, and to consider
all material facts and
circumstances known to the testator with reference to which he is to be taken
to have used the words in the
will, and then to declare what is the intention
evidenced by the words used with reference to those facts and circumstances
which
were (or ought to have been) in the mind of the testator when he used
those words...the meaning of words varies according to the
circumstances of and
concerning which they were used."
<P>

     
<P>

37  	Here the particular circumstance to take into account is the
fact that both at the date of death and the date of the will Mr
Drieman was in
occupation and was paying rent for the property at Mooney Mooney.  The
importance of this fact lies in the absence
of the statement of the purpose of
the first part of the trust in question.
<P>

38  	Given that he is in occupation and is required to pay rent, the
trust would be for him to occupy the property subject to the
payment of charges
and the rent.
<P>

39  	Factors which favour this construction are:
<P>

 
<P>

(a), the use of the word, "absolute" in the final trust provision on the death
of Isabella and, 
<P>

(b) the use of the word, "trust" in the first part of the provision and, 
<P>

(c), the fact that the Mooney Mooney provisions are similar to the provisions
made by the deceased in his will in respect of the
Waldron Road property.
<P>

40  	However there is a difference in relation to the Waldron Street
property of which the plaintiff is the main beneficiary.  The
will provided as
follows:
<P>

 
<P>

"Should the plaintiff predecease Isabella Hodgson then the property 96 Waldron
Road, Chester Hill is held in trust to the next of
kin as named in the
plaintiff's will.  The rental and other conditions apply until the demise of
Isabella Hodgson when the payments
and property in trust cease and the
property....becomes the property of the plaintiff's heirs absolutely."
<P>

41  	The right to occupy was for the period up until the death of
Isabella. It in effect is an interest for the remaining life of
Isabella with
an absolute remainder interest on her death.
<P>

42  	In the circumstance of Mr Drieman predeceasing Isabella, the
gift in remainder would fail.
<P>

43  	The next question is whether the interest in remainder falls
into residue or whether  there is an intestacy. The matter is
dealt with in
Theobold on Wills, 5th edition at p321.  There the authors say in dealing with
reversions and remainders:
<P>

"Where general words, such as "all other my lands" or the like are used, which,
according to their natural meaning, are sufficient
to include such interests as
a reversion, or remainder, those interests are not be excluded because some of
the limitations of the
will canno6t take effect as regards the reversion or
remainder.
<P>

 
<P>

On the other hand, if a reversion is referred to as descending to a son to whom
it could not pass if it is included in the will,
it will not pass by the
will.
<P>

 
<P>

Again, a testator may have given partial interests in land  his will, and the
question then arises, whether a subsequent residuary
devise passes the
reversion of those lands.  It is well settled that it does, though the
residuary devise may be of lands &#180;not
hereinbefore devised or disposed
of,' and there may be directions or limitations which are not appropriate to
the reversion in the
lands previously devised."
<P>

     
<P>

44  	Accordingly the property now passes under the residuary gift to
Yvonne.
<P>

45  	There is a provision also in the will dealing with the roofing
of Iolanda's property. That provision provides:
<P>

 
<P>

"Should the house of Iolanda Hoare at 9 Torrington Avenue Sefton need a new
tile roof installed then have a new tile roof installed
with Colorbond
guttering and downpipe as soon as possible."
<P>

46  	The deceased was silent as to the fund from which that would be
paid and Iolanda's property does not form part of the estate.
 It was
transferred to her by the deceased inter vivos in 1975. The cost of roofing was
not an expense referable to the maintenance
of an estate asset and it would
seem the monies should be provided out of residue.
<P>

47  	There is one matter where there is perhaps an exception and that
is in respect of the cost of the upkeep of assets devised
by the will as
appears from <b>Allen v Attorney General</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1914/62.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1914] NSWStRp 62</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281914%29%2015%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1914) 15 SR (NSW) 41.</a> Those
expenses ought to be borne by specific legatees of the properties. There may be
other matters in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> matters which are about to commence
which will need to be considered as to how the burden of any provision might be
borne.
<P>

48  	It seems to me it is appropriate to make the findings that I
have made in this judgment.
<P>

49  	I direct the parties to bring in short minutes to reflect those
findings.
<P>

50  	I have heard submissions on costs.  In my view it is appropriate
that each of the parties' costs on an indemnity basis be paid
or retained out
of the estate of the deceased. I so order.  The only question that arises is
whether those costs should be borne
by residue or in some way by the properties
which were the real subject matter of the proceedings.
<P>

51  	Section 94(3) gives a power for the court to order such costs to
be paid out of such property.  In the circumstances Mooney
Mooney importantly
does fall into residue and passes to Yvonne and the costs in respect of the
renovation fund, which is the other
subject matter or fund, passes to Yvonne
and Isabella.  In the circumstances there are no particular factors which
incline me to
depart from the usual rule that the costs be payable out of
residue and I so order.
