<b>JUDGMENT  -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>29 November 1999</b>
<P>

<b>THE CENTRAL ISSUE</b>
<P>

1   	The only issue before me is whether the service of a copy
of an application by Summons to set aside a statutory demand, but
which omits
the return date on the later filed Summons, fatally contravenes s459G of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> by that fact alone;  this is when all other
requirements of s459G were complied with.  That is the separate question with
which I
am now to deal. 
<P>

<b>SALIENT FACTS AND RESOLUTION OF THE CENTRAL ISSUE</b>
<P>

2   	The facts briefly stated are these.  The Defendant served a
statutory demand on the Plaintiff on 29 July 1999.
<P>

3   	The parties agree that the twenty-one day period mandated
by s459G of the <i>Corporations Law</i> expired on 20 August 1999.  By that
date, the Plaintiff had to do the following:
<P>

(i)	make an application under s459G(2) to set aside the statutory demand, which
it did.
<P>

(ii)	file an affidavit under s459G(3) supporting the application with the
Court, which it did.
<P>

(iii)	serve a copy of the above supporting affidavit under s459G(3) upon the
Defendant, which it did, and
<P>

(iv)	serve a copy of the application under s459G(3), upon the Defendant, which
it omitted to do, but only insofar as the copy of
the application served
omitted the return date (as the Summons had yet to be filed).
<P>

4   	The Defendant contends that this is an irremediable
departure from s459G of the <i>Corporations Law</i> and that <i>David Grant Pty
Limited v Westpac Banking Corporation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 265</a> binds this Court
to conclude that the essential conditions of s459G have therefore not been
complied with.
<P>

5   	The Plaintiff contends that, consistent with the approach
of Young J in <i>Howship Holdings Pty Limited v Leslie</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1996/314.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] NSWSC 314</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 542</a>
at 544, following amongst other decisions <i>Hope v Hope</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1854/805.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1854] EngR 805</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=43%20ER%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">43 ER 534</a> at 539
service should be understood in the terms stated by Lord Cranworth:
<P>

"the object of all service is of course only to give notice to the party on
whom it is made, so that he may be made aware of and
may be able to resist that
which is sought against him; and when that has been substantially done, so that
the court may \feel perfectly
confident that service has reached him,
everything has been done that is required."
<P>

6   	But there lies the answer to the Plaintiff's argument.  For
how can the party who is served have received proper notice of
the proceedings
for which attendance is required within the twenty-one days when that party is
not told of the important fact of
the return date for the application to set
aside the statutory demand till after the twenty-one days.  
<P>

7   	Had the copy been served in advance of the filing of the
identical application but with a notation of the return date written
thereon in
some fashion, assuming that that information could be obtained in advance of
filing, I might have concluded that the Plaintiff
had done what it needed to do
to conform to s459G of the <i>Corporations Law</i>  --  on the basis that there
is no magic in the order of the events that have to take place within the
twenty-one days, though the
argument is still open that the Defendant needs to
know for certain it has been filed and not simply rely on an anticipated return
date that turns out to be correct.  But regrettably not even that occurred.
That is not altered by the fact that the Defendant was
apprised of the return
date later, since that was some six days after the twenty-one days and that is
too late.
<P>

8   	While this result appears productive of hardship and unduly
technical, it is in my view regrettably unavoidable.  No doubt
if the matter
reaches the stage of application under s459S to the extent the Court is
satisfied as to the matters there set out,
then winding-up can be reviewed in
the overall context of what the Court may then take into account.  
<P>

<b>ORDERS AND COSTS</b>
<P>

9   	Costs in the circumstances must follow the event and I
award costs against the Plaintiff to the Defendant.  
<P>

10   	I should also record that the Plaintiff in the best
traditions of the Bar very properly raised the discrepancy between the
summons
that was filed and the summons that was served (the absence of the return date)
though I do not mean to suggest thereby that
counsel for the Defendant was not
aware of that discrepancy.
<P>

11   	I dismiss the Plaintiff's Summons.
<P>

	                                     **********
