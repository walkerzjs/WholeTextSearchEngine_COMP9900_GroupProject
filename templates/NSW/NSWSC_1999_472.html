<b><u>10810/99  -  ANTHONY DEVELOPMENTS PTY LIMITED T/as CUT-PRICE RENT-A-CAR
v  GEOFFREY ARTHUR MARSDEN</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>This matter comes before the Court by way of
case stated by Mr G Henson, Local Court Magistrate.
<P>

2  	Mr Geoffrey Marsden hired a car from Anthony Developments Pty
Limited, trading as Cut-Price Rent-A-Car (Cut-Price Rent-A-Car).
 At the time
of the hire, Mr Marsden signed a hire agreement.  The terms of that agreement
are not included in the stated case.
<P>

3  	At the time the car was hired, Mr Marsden sought to have the
vehicle insured whilst the vehicle was on hire.  He paid an additional
amount
to this end.
<P>

4  	On 1 November 1994, Mr Marsden was involved in an accident with
another vehicle driven by a Mr Handley.
<P>

5  	Mr Handley commenced proceedings in the Local Court claiming the
cost of the car repairs (approximately $5,352) plus costs.
 The claim named
Cut-Price Rent-A-Car as first defendant, and Mr Marsden as the second.  The
statement of claim apparently asserted,
as the basis of liability of the hire
company, that it was the owner of the vehicle (as it was), and having hired the
vehicle, Mr
Marsden was its agent.  Mr Marsden, however, was plainly not the
hire company's agent, and the claim against the hire company was
bound to
fail.
<P>

6  	Mr Marsden, naturally, sought from Cut-Price Rent-A-Car the name
of the insurer.  Cut-Price Rent-A-Car, surprisingly, and unhelpfully,
refused
to identify that insurer.  In those circumstances, Mr Marsden, recognising that
he was responsible for the collision, proceeded
to settle the plaintiff's
claim.  The terms of settlement were filed on 17 June 1997.  He was required to
pay approximately $9,000,
being the cost of repairs and costs.
<P>

7  	Again Mr Marsden sought the name of the insurer from Cut-Price
Rent-A-Car.  Again that company declined to provide that information.
 This
material was not included in the facts stated by the learned Magistrate, but
was common ground before me.
<P>

8  	Mr Marsden, in these circumstances, began an action against
Cut-Price Rent-A-Car in the Local Court.  The terms of his claim
do not form
part of the stated case.  However, the broad basis was described by the learned
Magistrate in the following paragraph:
<P>

"On 25 July 1997 the current proceedings were commenced by the Respondent
alleging that the Appellant was obliged by an express
term in the contract of
hire to, in the event of an accident and subsequent claim, disclose to the
Respondent, the identity of the
insurer of the vehicle for the purpose of
indemnification under a comprehensive insurance policy over the hired
vehicle."
<P>

9  	The proceedings first went to arbitration.  One gathers that the
arbitrator determined the matter against Cut-Price Rent-A-Car.
 The company
thereafter sought, as was its right, a rehearing before the Local Court.
<P>

10  	The matter came before Mr Henson, a Magistrate, on 10 August
1998.  Cut-Price Rent-A-Car sought to amend its defence in order
to raise an
estoppel.  It asserted that Mr Marsden was estopped from pursuing his claim,
having not sought indemnity under the insurance
arrangements in the original
proceedings brought by Mr Handley.  The estoppel was said to arise under the
principle enunciated by
the High Court in <b><i>Port of Melbourne Authority v
Anshun Pty Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%2d81%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980-81) 147 CLR 589.</a>  The learned Magistrate dealt
with the issue as a preliminary matter.  He determined that there was no
estoppel.  There was, accordingly,
no entitlement to a permanent stay.  The
matter then proceeded, and the merits were investigated.  The learned
Magistrate decided
in favour of Mr Marsden.
<P>

<b>The <i>Anshun</i> Principle</b>
<P>

11  	The source of the <b><i>Anshun</i></b> estoppel is the statement
by Sir James Wigram VC in <b><i>Henderson v Henderson</i></b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 917</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%2067%20ER%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 67 ER 313</a>,
which was in these terms:
<P>

"Where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication
by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court
requires the parties to that
litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under
special circumstances) permit
the same parties to open the same subject of
litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part
of the
subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they
have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted
part of their
case.  The plea of <i>res judicata</i> applies, except in special cases, not
only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to
form an opinion
and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly
belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising
reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time."
<P>

12  	The principle has evolved over time.  At first the estoppel only
arose in circumstances where there was "an omission to deny
a traversable
allegation" (<b><i>Anshun</i></b> at 599).  It is now accepted that it can
arise in circumstances where an affirmative defence has not been pleaded in the
first action.
<P>

13  	The principle rests upon the foundation of two ideas.  First,
there is the aspect of fairness and efficiency.  A party should
bring before
the Court its whole case at the one time.  Secondly, there is the aspect of
consistency.  If a party's case comes before
the Court piecemeal, there is the
danger that any judgment given in the first proceedings will conflict with that
in the second.
<P>

14  	In <b><i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty
Limited</i></b>, Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ, said this:  (at 602/603)
<P>

" ... there will be no estoppel unless it appears that the matter relied upon
as a defence in the second action was so relevant
to the subject matter of the
first action that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it.  Generally
speaking, it would be
unreasonable not to plead a defence if, having regard to
the nature of the plaintiff's claim, and its subject matter it would be
expected that the defendant would raise the defence and thereby enable the
relevant issues to be determined in the one proceeding.
 In this respect, we
need to recall that there are a variety of circumstances, some referred to in
the earlier cases, why a party
may justifiably refrain from litigating an issue
in one proceeding yet wish to litigate the issue in other proceedings e.g.
expense,
importance of the particular issue, motives extraneous to the actual
litigation, to mention but a few."
<P>

15  	Their Honours continued:  (at 603)
<P>

"It has generally been accepted that a party will be estopped from bringing an
action which, if it succeeds, will result in a judgment
which conflicts with an
earlier judgment."
<P>

16  	In <b><i>Rahme v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i></b> (C of A,
unreported, 20 December 1991), Priestley JA, when discussing the High Court's
analysis of <b><i>Anshun</i></b>, identified three situations where the
estoppel may arise.  His Honour said this:  (at 4)
<P>

"They next discussed various aspects of the principle, including situations
where (1) what was brought forward in defence to the
second proceeding was
matter which would have provided a defence to the first but was not raised, (2)
what was brought forward in
the second proceeding was a cause of action which
could have been relied on as a defence in the first proceedings, but was not,
and
(3) a second proceeding upon a cause of action which could have been raised
as a cause of action in the first proceedings, but was
not."
<P>

17  	His Honour elaborated upon the third situation in these
terms:
<P>

"The decision of Gibbs CJ and Mason and Aickin JJ in Anshun seems to me to be
authority for the following propositions:  1, that
Wigram VC's extended
principle as stated in Henderson is accepted as good law by the High Court;  2,
that that principle applies,
inter alia, to category (3) cases, that is to a
proceeding in which a party is asserting a cause of action which could have
been
raised, but was not, in a previous proceeding in which the same party was
asserting a different cause of action based on substantially
the same facts
against the same party as the second proceeding is being brought;  and 3, that
the extended principle of Henderson
will be applied to the second proceeding
when it was unreasonable for the party asserting the cause of action in that
second proceeding
to refrain from raising it in the earlier proceeding against
the same opponent party."
<P>

18  	It is instructive to look at the facts in <b><i>Anshun</i></b>
itself.  The Port of Melbourne Authority owned a crane.  It hired the crane to
Anshun Pty Limited ("Anshun") on terms which included
an agreement to indemnify
the Port of Melbourne Authority against any claim arising out of the company's
use of the crane.  A workman
was injured in the course of his employment when
girders being handled by the crane fell on him.  He sued both the Port
Melbourne
Authority and Anshun for damages, alleging each was negligent.  The
defendants claimed contribution from each other, as joint tort
feasors.
<P>

19  	The Port of Melbourne Authority did not assert any right to
indemnity under its hire agreement with Anshun.  The matter was
then determined
by the Court.  The plaintiff succeeded against both defendants.  The liability
of the defendants on the contribution
notices was divided ninety percent to the
Port Melbourne Authority, and ten percent to Anshun.
<P>

20  	It was in these circumstances that the Port of Melbourne
Authority commenced a fresh action against Anshun, asserting the right
to
indemnity under the hire agreement.  The Court said that they could not do so,
and permanently stayed the action.  Commenting
upon the facts, their Honours
Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ, said this:  (at 596)
<P>

"The judgment which the Authority seeks to obtain in the present action is one
which would contradict the judgment which has been
entered in the Soterales
action.  The judgment in that action was that Anshun should recover
contribution from the Authority to the
extent of 90 per cent of Soterales'
damages and costs and that the Authority should recover from Anshun
contribution to the extent
of 10 per cent of the damages and costs.  The
judgment which the Authority now seeks is one whereby the Authority recovers
from Anshun
the whole of Soterales' damages and costs.  It is this
inconsistency between the judgment obtained in the first action and the
judgment
sought to be obtained now that is of importance."
<P>

21  	Their Honours added:  (at 604)
<P>

"Taking into consideration the relevant factors we conclude that the Full Court
was right in holding that there was an estoppel.
 The matter now sought to be
raised by the Authority was a defence to Anshun's claim in the first action.
It was so closely connected
with the subject matter of that action that it was
to be expected that it would be relied upon as a defence to that claim and as
a
basis for recovery by the Authority from Anshun.  The third party procedures
were introduced to enable this to be done.  If successful,
the indemnity case
would have obviated an inquiry into contribution.  If reserved for assertion in
a later action, it would increase
costs and give rise to a conflicting
judgment."
<P>

<b>The Application of the <i>Anshun</i> Principle</b>
<P>

22  	Here, the circumstances are quite different from those in the
<b><i>Anshun</i></b> case.  First, the original proceedings by Mr Handley did
not include any issue between Mr Marsden and Cut-Price Rent-A-Car.  They
were
simply two parties named by Mr Handley in the one action.  There was no
exchange of third party notices between defendants,
nor the commencement of
cross claims.  Had there been a third party notice or cross claim, there would
have been an issue between
the defendants, and an obligation upon each to bring
forth their whole case against each other.
<P>

23  	Secondly, there is no risk of inconsistency.  The judgment in
the first proceedings was in respect of an action between Mr
Handley and Mr
Marsden.  It did not, and obviously could not, deal with the rights and
obligations of Mr Marsden in relation to Cut-Price
Rent-A-Car.
<P>

24  	Thirdly, in terms of the objective of fairness and efficiency,
which underpin the <b><i>Anshun</i></b> estoppel, the separation of the two
actions is neither inefficient nor unfair.  The issues in the first action
concern the circumstances
of the accident, and the damage to the vehicle.  The
issue in the second presupposes the resolution of those issues against Mr
Marsden,
but depends upon the contractual arrangements between Mr Marsden, and
Cut-Price Rent-A-Car.  In my view it is neither unfair nor
inefficient to
separate those issues.  Indeed, for convenience, and upon the application of a
party, such issues are often separated.
<P>

25  	Adopting the wording of Priestley JA in <b><i>Rahme v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i></b> (supra), when describing the third
category within the <b><i>Anshun</i></b> principle, the requirements of that
category are simply not present.  To come within category 3, two conditions
must be met:
<P>

&#183;	First, Mr Marsden, in the second proceedings, must assert a cause of
action which could have been raised in the first proceedings,
but was not.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, Mr Marsden, in the first proceedings, must assert against the
same party as in the second proceedings (that is,
Cut-Price Rent-A-Car) a
different cause of action based on substantially the same facts.
<P>

There was, as mentioned, simply no action, and therefore no joinder of issue,
between Mr Marsden and Cut-Price Rent-A-Car in the
first proceedings.
<P>

26  	The appellant's contention involves an assertion that Mr Marsden
was obliged to serve a third party notice upon Cut-Price Rent-A-Car
in Mr
Handley's action.  There is no warrant for that assertion.  In circumstances
which are analogous, Simpson J (with whom I respectfully
agree) made the
following comment upon the application of the <b><i>Anshun</i></b> estoppel in
the context of a defamation action:  (<b><i>Green v Schneller</i></b>
(unreported, 12 January 1999) at 4)
<P>

"During the course of the hearing of the notice of motion I raised the question
of whether it was correct for counsel for the defendant
to assert, as he did,
that the defendant would retain her right to bring proceedings for indemnity
and/or contribution against Amalgamated
Television, even after the conclusion
of the principal proceedings.  The cause for my concern was the decision of the
High Court
in <i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147
CLR 589.</a>  Having re-read those judgments, and having read the written
submissions from both counsel that resulted from that concern, I am
satisfied
that that decision will not prevent the prosecution by the defendant of any
claim she may with to bring against Amalgamated
Television."
<P>

27  	I therefore believe that the determination by the Learned
Magistrate, that the <b><i>Anshun</i></b> estoppel had no application in the
circumstances of this matter, was not erroneous in point of law.
<P>

28  	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1.	Appeal dismissed.
<P>

2.	The appellant should pay the respondent's costs.
