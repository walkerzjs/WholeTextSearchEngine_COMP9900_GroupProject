<b>JUDGMENT (On plaintiff's Notice of Motion to preclude inspection by the
defendant of documents the subject of a subpoena and Notice
to Produce issued
to the plaintiff and subpoena to the New South Wales Police Service)</b>
<P>

<b>	The Actions</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff sues the defendant, first, in respect of a publication on 13
March 1995.  The jury has determined that that publication
("<i>Today
Tonight</i>") conveyed the following defamatory imputations:
<P>

	<i>"1(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with boys who were under the
age of 18 knowing them to be under the age of 18.</i>
<P>

<i>	3(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with a 15 year old boy who
was then under the influence of drugs which had been given
to him by the
plaintiff".</i>
<P>

2	The second action arises from the <i>"Witness</i>" program telecast on 7 May
1996.  In respect of that program, the jury has determined that it conveyed the
following defamatory imputations:
<P>

	<i>"1(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old boys,
having deliberately refrained from asking those boys how old
they were.</i>
<P>

	<i>2(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old male
prostitutes having deliberately refrained from asking them how
old they
were".</i>
<P>

	<b>The Defendant's Substantive Application</b>
<P>

3	By Notices of Motion filed in Court on 18 February 1999 the defendant seeks
leave to amend its particulars of justification. 
The application has yet to be
determined.
<P>

	<b>The Present Notice of Motion</b>
<P>

4	Process has been served upon the plaintiff and the Police Service of New
South Wales for the production of certain documents.
<P>

5	By a Notice of Motion filed in Court on 9 March 1999 (it is a composite
Notice of Motion to cover the matters that were the subject
of argument up to
that point of time), the plaintiff seeks, an order that:
<P>

	<i>"1.	Inspection of the following documents be restricted to the plaintiff
and his legal advisers:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Material produced to the Court by the New South Wales police service in
answer to subpoenas for production over which the plaintiff
has claimed
privilege;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Material produced to the Court by the plaintiff in answer to a subpoena
for production issued on 2 February 1999 at the request
of the defendant over
which the plaintiff has claimed privilege;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Confidential ExhibitsBJW-1, BJW-3, BJW-4 &amp; BJW-5 to the affidavit
of Brian James Whittaker affirmed on 1 March 1999 and filed
in these
proceedings;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	Confidential Exhibit MBJL-1 to the affidavit of Michael Bryan Joshua
Lee sworn 1 March 1999 and filed in these proceedings;</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	Confidential Exhibits Wf-1 to Wf-14 of Wayne Flynn's affidavit affirmed
on 2 March 1999 and filed in these proceedings;</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	Confidential Exhibits MBJL- to MBJL-4 of Michael Bryan Joshua Lee's
affidavit sworn on 2 March 1999 and filed in these proceedings".</i>
<P>

6	The matters referred to in the Notice of Motion arise from the following
subpoenas and Notice to Produce.  Two subpoenas were
served upon the Police
Service and the history of their being dealt with by this Court is as
follows:
<P>

7	The material produced to the Court by the Police Service arises from the
following process as I understand it:  a subpoena was
issued on behalf of the
plaintiff on 13 October 1998 returnable on 3 November 1998.  A limited call was
made on this subpoena and
a claim for public interest immunity was dealt with
by Ireland J on 24 December on which date his Honour's made certain rulings.
The plaintiff's subpoena to the Police (which is annexure "H" to the affidavit
of Michael Woodhouse sworn 2 March 1999), on its face,
called for an
substantial body of material.
<P>

8	On 18 January 1999 the defendant's solicitors issued a subpoena to the Police
returnable on 27 January which also called for the
production of a substantial
body of material.  As I understand it, a limited call on this subpoena was
made.  The Police Service
has from time to time delivered to the Court material
in answer to both subpoenas.  The plaintiff had first access to that material
and extracted documents in relation to which the claim for privilege is made.

<P>

9	It is appropriate to mention that a further subpoena to the Police Service
was issued on or about 26 February 1999 requiring production
of "<i>all records
(that is, reports, documents, memoranda, records of interview, transcripts of
interview, file notes, computer print outs,
audio tapes, and video tapes) of
the meeting which took place on or about 29 January 1999 between the New South
Wales Police and
John Robert Marsden and/or his legal advisers"</i>.  This
subpoena is subject to a separate claim by the Police Service based upon public
interest immunity in respect of which a separate
ruling will be given.  The
meeting referred to, namely that which occurred on 29 January 1999 is
significant to this extent:  on
25 February 1999 the defendant served a Notice
to Produce upon the plaintiff requiring production of materials in the same
terms
as that in the subpoena served upon the Police Service.  (This Notice to
Produce is referred to in the affidavit of Michael Bryan
Joshua Lee, solicitor,
sworn on 2 March 1999, paragraph 2.)  In respect of the documents the subject
of the subpoena to the Police
relating to the interview on 29 January 1999, no
claim for privilege is made by the plaintiff.  The only matter to be determined
is the Police Service's claim for public interest immunity.  It is in respect
of the plaintiff's records in relation to the same
meeting and subject to the
Notice to Produce to which I have just referred that the claim for privilege is
made.
<P>

10	Further, a subpoena was issued on 2 February 1999 addressed to the plaintiff
to produce, <i>inter alia</i>, "<i>2.  All records of any statements made to
the Police by John Robert Marsden during the period 1993 to date;  3.  All
records of any
statements made or evidence given by John Robert Marsden to the
Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service during the
period 1993
to 1998</i>".
<P>

11	Another historical matter that should be noted is this:  up to the time that
I was called upon to hear argument in relation to
the plaintiff's Notice of
Motion, the procedure had been adopted (as exemplified by the proceedings
before Ireland J), whereby matters
relating to subpoenas, Notices to Produce or
any process which could involve the examination of material that might become
evidence
in the trial would be heard "<i>elsewhere</i>" so as to
"<i>quarantine</i>" myself as the trial judge.  It rapidly became apparent that
this was as impractical as it was unnecessary.  As the trial judge I
will
determine the issues on the evidence and make my findings on the evidence and
according to the relevant legal considerations.
<P>

12	For the purposes of the present exercise I have examined the material in
respect of which privilege is claimed.  This examination
was not on the basis
of reading every document word by word but rather perusing the bulk to get a
"<i>feel</i>" for the overall nature of the material in respect of which the
claim for privilege was made.  By reason of the degree of complexity
involved
in reaching some concordance of the material, insofar as it appears in several
"<i>bundles",</i> more detailed consideration of particular components of the
material in dispute will be necessary.
<P>

13	Shortly stated, the material comprises what might be described as the
plaintiff's material, Royal Commission material, Police
material, and the
material arising from the meeting of 29 January 1999.
<P>

	<b>The Problem with the Law</b>
<P>

14	As I have stated the plaintiff's Notice of Motion to exclude access is an
interlocutory application effectively being heard within
a substantive
interlocutory application by the defendant to amend its Defence, which is
within a <i>"trial in progress</i>".  The very nature of the application being
interlocutory gave rise to the question of the operation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act, 1995</a></i> (NSW) in relation to proceedings of the kind with which I am
concerned.  
<P>

15	For the plaintiff it is contended that the principles embodied in the
provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> </i>(NSW) dealing with client legal
privilege govern the question whether documents produced on subpoena are
privileged from inspection.
 I am bound to follow, it is argued, the decision
of the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Akins &amp; Ors v Abigroup Limited
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/254.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 254</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 539.</a>  The principal passage from the judgment of the
President, at 545-546 is as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Claims of privilege may be made in connexion with processes ancillary to
trials, notably discovery, interrogatories and the production
of documents
under subpoena or notice to produce. (I shall refer to these compendiously as
the pre-trial gathering of evidence.)
As regards discovery in proceedings
commenced on or after 1 October 1996, or in respect of interrogatories pursuant
to notice given
or order made on or after that date, the Supreme Court Rules
incorporate by reference the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> principles: see Pt23, r1(c); Pt24,
r6(3)(c). However the corresponding rules as they stood in relation to
proceedings such as the
directors' proceedings simply acknowledge that the
processes of discovery or interrogatories might involve questions of privilege.
And there has never been a rule addressing the application of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>
in relation to subpoenas or notices to produce.</i>
<P>

<i>	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (Cth) and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> make significant
changes to the law of evidence in relation to client legal privilege. These
include the adoption of the dissenting
view of Barwick CJ in <b>Grant v
Downs</b> (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s118)</a> and other changes: see generally, <b>Adelaide Steamship Co
Ltd v Spalvins</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/144.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 144</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20152%20ALR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 152 ALR 418</a> at 427.</i>
<P>

<i>	The impact of the Acts upon pre-trial gathering of evidence has been a
matter of controversy in the cases. It is common ground that
each Act is in
terms relevantly confined to the adducing of evidence, and that this expression
does not in its ordinary and natural
meaning extend to ancillary processes
involving the pre-trial gathering of evidence. In the decision under appeal,
Bainton J held
that the common law of client legal privilege (including the
waiver thereof) was unaffected in relation to the pre-trial gathering
of
evidence, even for hearings commenced on or after 1 September 1995 when the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> generally commenced in New South Wales courts. Opposed to this
view are <b>Telstra [No 1]</b> and the recent decision of the Full Court of the
Federal Court of Australia in <b>Adelaide Steamship Co.</b> Bainton J was
however in accord with the views expressed by Foster J in <b>Esso Australia
Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20150%20ALR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 150 ALR 117</a>; Hill J in <b>Zemanek v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</b>
(Federal Court of Australia, 2 October 1997, unreported) and Goldberg J in
<b>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores
Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20153%20ALR%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 153 ALR 393</a> (albeit that Goldberg J recognised that he was
obliged to bow to the contrary view adopted recently by the Full Federal
Court). There
have also been a significant number of cases which have held or
assumed one position or the other without detailed analysis.</i>
<P>

<i>	The detailed consideration of the legal issues in <b>Telstra [No 1</b>] and
<b>Adelaide Steamship Co</b> relieves me of the need to address the matter at
length. With one presently immaterial qualification, I would respectfully adopt
and follow the reasoning in those cases and hold that the principles of the Act
touching client legal privilege apply derivatively
to ancillary processes
involving the pre-trial gathering of evidence. I acknowledge that this entails
recognition that the common
law is modified so as to accord with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a> in this area".</i>
<P>

16	And at 547F his Honour, after enumerating his reasons for the position he
took at 546C said:
<P>

	<i>"5. Pt3.10, Div 1 (client legal privilege) does not abrogate the privilege,
or undercut its high function. Rather it fine tunes the
law and states it in
accessible legislative form. The principles of statutory interpretation
touching the construction of legislation
abrogating common law rights have
little or no impact in this context: Adelaide Steamship Co (at 429)".</i>
<P>

17	It was the position of the plaintiff that the material over which privilege
was claimed fell squarely within the privilege conferred
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 118</a>
("<i>advice"</i> privilege) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 119</a> ("<i>litigation"</i> privilege) at the
time at which the material was created.  Below, I refer to the evidence of
certain of the documents being created
before 1 September 1995.  That this is
so was because the material was constituted principally by statutory
declarations originally
created for privileged purposes, and/or consisted of
copies of documents, which copies were made for a privileged purpose or
purposes:
 <b><i>Commissioner of Australian Federal v Propend Finance Pty
Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20141%20ALR%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 141 ALR 545</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d7%29%20188%20CLR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-7) 188 CLR 501.</a>
<P>

18	The privileged purpose/purposes were for use by the plaintiffs lawyers as
evidence in current or anticipated civil proceedings
and anticipated criminal
proceedings;  for use by the plaintiff's lawyers in providing him with advice
in respect of such proceedings;
 use by the plaintiff's lawyers in dissuading
the investigating and prosecuting authorities from commencing the anticipated
criminal
proceedings.
<P>

19	The only question was whether privilege had been lost by reason of the
disclosure of that material to the Royal Commission or
to the Police.
<P>

20	The only relevant provision in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i>in this respect is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
122(2).</a>  That section does not operate to defeat the claim of privilege because
in respect of each document the disclosure was made "<i>under compulsion of
law</i>" pursuant to notices issued under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission
(Police Service) Act 1994</a></i> - s 122(2)(c) and/or "<i>in the course of making
a confidential communication"</i> in the sense that "<i>the person to whom it
was made was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its
contents"</i> - s 122(2)(a) and s 117(1)(i).  Accordingly, the material
retained its privilege character and inspection should not be granted to
the
defendant.  
<P>

21	In any event, and even if the common law test were applied to the question
of whether documents produced on subpoena are privileged
from inspection, there
can be no "<i>unfairness</i>" to the defendant in denying it inspection.  The
only disclosures were made to the Royal Commission or to the Police for the
purpose
of assisting them in their inquiries.  The plaintiff's giving of that
assistance in those contexts in no way prejudiced the defendant
in these
proceedings or in any other way.
<P>

22	In amplification of these propositions (originally set out in the written
document provided by Mr McHugh, counsel for the plaintiff),
more particularly
referred to the position of his client in relation to the various collections
of documents.
<P>

23	The documents in relation to the meeting of 29 January are the subject of a
claim constituted by circumstances where a solicitor
makes a document for the
purpose of advising his client or otherwise providing professional legal
services to his client and the
documents are prima facie privileged where the
"<i>sole</i>" purposes was so doing was one of the purpose of the just
mentioned.  In relation to this bundle of documents there could be no question
of waiver because they had not been dealt with otherwise than by being brought
into existence and brought into Court in response
to the Notice to Produce
<P>

24	In relation to the subpoena dated 2 February 1999 <i>(supra</i> paragraph
10), the claim for privilege is in relation to various documents principally in
the nature of witness statements and statutory
declarations collected by
various lawyers on behalf of the plaintiff and created by various persons on
behalf of the plaintiff in
relation to anticipated criminal proceedings arising
out of allegations that were made in the New South Wales Parliament by Mrs
Grusovin
and then relating to the defamation proceedings that had been
commenced in 1995 and the second proceedings commenced in 1996.  As
to the last
mentioned, it is said that the material was in anticipation of the publication
of that matter complained of especially
in regard to the applications made by
the plaintiff for injunctive relief.  It is said that although the documents
constituting this
bundle of material may have been prepared for more than one
purpose in the sense that they may have been prepared for anticipated
criminal
proceedings and for defamation proceedings, each of the purposes was a
privileged purpose.  And each can be characterised
as a "<i>sole</i>"
purpose.
<P>

25	With respect to the documents produced by the police, the vast majority of
them, it is said, are in the nature of witness statements
originally obtained
by the plaintiff or his lawyers or people acting on his behalf in connection
with anticipated proceedings.  Insofar
as there may be components of the police
documents that are documents created by the police, for example, records of
interviews or
running sheets, insofar as material was put to the interviewee,
or otherwise referred to, which was sourced in documents over which
the
plaintiff claims privilege, it is contended that the plaintiff's privilege
attaches to those portions of the records of interview
or other documents.  In
so far as there may be a question of waiver - (how did the Police get the
documents?) - the fact of the documents
coming into the possession of the
police does not constitute a waiver of the privilege said to attach to those
documents or parts
of them.  Insofar as documents in the possession of the
Police were documents provided by the plaintiff to the Royal Commission,
they
were provided under compulsion of law and were provided in circumstances of
confidentiality.
<P>

26	For the defendant (which seeks access to the material not merely for its
application to amend its Defence but for the purposes
of the trial generally),
it was argued that the common law essentially applies.  The formal submission
was made that <b><i>Akins v Abigroup</i></b> and the cases upon which it
depended was and were wrongly decided.  Particularly reference was made to the
part of the judgment of
the President in <b><i>Akins</i></b> at 548A-E:
<P>

	<i>"(I mention one caveat. A nice question would arise were the matter in
issue whether a document prepared for the dominant but not
sole purpose of
providing legal advice was privileged from disclosure in some ancillary process
involving the pre-trial gathering
of evidence. <b>Grant v Downs</b> still
represents the common law in this State. I recognise that most of the cases
which arrived at the view which I have adopted
saw it as an inevitable
consequence that <b>Grant v Downs</b> no longer applies in jurisdictions where
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> principles apply: see, eg, <b>Adelaide Steamship Co</b> (at
428-429). According to Goldberg J in <b>Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd</b> (at 420<b>), Telstra [No
1]</b> turned on the dominant purpose issue; but this is not apparent on the
face of the report of that case. I am far from convinced that
any court other
than the High Court has the right to depart from <b>Grant v Downs</b> merely
because of the indirect or flow-on effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>. Notwithstanding
the gravitational pull of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s118</a> it may be that only the High Court could
administer the coup de grace to Grant v Downs if that is to be its fate in the
Federal Court
and courts in New South Wales in the light of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.
In <b>Ravenor Overseas Inc v Readhead</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%20671" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 671</a> at 672; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=152%20ALR%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">152 ALR
416</a> at 416, Brennan CJ said that:</i>
<P>

<i>	"... Nothing is more important to the due administration of justice than
that the Courts of Australia should faithfully follow decisions
of this Court.
This Court has the responsibility of determining the law applicable throughout
the Commonwealth. Nor should it be
thought that, because some new argument can
be devised contrary to a holding of this Court, the authority of its decisions
become
problematic. Although the decisions of this Court will, when this Court
deems it necessary, be revisited, there should be no qualification
about the
duty of other Courts faithfully to apply the decisions of this Court as they
stand)."</i>
<P>

27	It was this "<i>nice point</i>" which was seized upon by the Full Federal
Court in <b><i>Esso Australia Resources Limited v Federal Commissioner of
Taxation</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1655.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1655</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20159%20ALR%20664" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 159 ALR 664.</a> 
<P>

28	The Full Court  of the Federal Court held that there is but one common law
in Australia by reason of which it is impossible to
accept that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 118</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">119</a>
(of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></i> (Cth)), had modified the common law applicable
to discovery in some courts while leaving that common law unmodified in other
courts.
 Conformably with what Mason P said in <b><i>Akins,</i></b> it is for
the High Court ultimately to declare that the common law of Australia has been
modified and to decide whether one of its
previous decisions (<b><i>Grant v
Downs</i></b>) should no longer be followed.  To the extent that the Full Court
of the Federal Court had concluded otherwise in <b><i>Adelaide Steamship Co v
Spalvins</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/144.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 144</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20152%20ALR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 152 ALR 418</a> that decision should not be followed.
<b><i>Spalvins</i></b>, of course, was followed in <b><i>Akins</i></b> (see
generally <b><i>Esso</i></b> at 607.15, 671.30 - 672.5;  678.5:  per Black CJ
and Sundberg J;  see also Finkelstein J at 713.35 and 714.45 - 715.35).
<P>

29	Mr Nicholas Q.C. for the defendant referred to passages in the judgment of
Merkel J.  At 687.5 his Honour acknowledged that there
was some justification
for the caveat the President pointed to in <b><i>Akins</i></b>.  Merkel J
however queried the use of the caveat as a qualification to the President's
decision in that case as one not easy to follow
(with which query I, with the
greatest respect, agree).
<P>

30	At 696.23 his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"There is a further difficulty with the decision of the Full Court. The
difficulty is that raised by the caveat of Mason P in <b>Akins v Abigroup</b>.
The principles governing client legal privilege were authoritatively laid down
in <b>Grant v Downs</b> and are not to be departed from other than by the High
Court. Whilst it can be accepted that it is open to the courts to adapt the
common law to a new policy setting, including that which is derived from the
analogical use of statutes, that is not the case where
the common law has
already been authoritatively determined by the High Court albeit, in the view
of the lower court, in a different
policy setting. In that situation, it is for
the High Court alone to determine that its decisions are to be departed from or
overruled
by reason of the new setting... </i>
<P>

<i>	For the above reasons I am of the view that the reasoning employed by the
Full Court in <b>Adelaide Steamship</b> in arriving at its conclusion that the
common law in respect of privilege had been modified derivatively by reason of
the enactment
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> is wrong. However, that does not lead to the
conclusion that the result arrived at by the Full Court was also wrong. The
same result
might be reached by a process of construction of the relevant
statutory provisions" </i>(see Merkel J also at 688.32.)
<P>

31	Mr Nicholas referred to the nature of client legal privilege as usefully
described by Gleeson CJ in <b><i>Benecke v National Australia Bank
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2035%20NSWLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 35 NSWLR 110</a> at 111E:
<P>

	<i>"The rule that prevents an unauthorised disclosure of confidential
communications between a client and a legal adviser, when such
communications
are for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, or for use in existing or
anticipated litigation, constitutes a restriction
upon the capacity of courts
to ascertain the truth in certain circumstances. That restriction, however, is
regarded as acceptable
on the ground that it promotes the public interest, and
assists the administration of justice, by facilitating the representation
of
clients by legal advisers. It does this by encouraging uninhibited
communication. Thus, in cases where the rule operates, one
aspect of the public
interest is preferred against another (discovering the truth)".</i>
<P>

32	In the context of the categorisation of the material the subject of the
Notice of Motion it was fundamental to the position of
the defendant that the
common law applied and that the true "<i>purpose</i>" was to present the
information to the Police and to the Royal Commission to "<i>advance the
plaintiff's interests</i>".  To truly characterise the exercise which involved
disclosure and/or presentation to the Police or to the Royal Commission on any
particular occasion to which any of the documents were relevant, was to say
really that it was by way of putting submissions to the
relevant authority
quite in the way that an advocate would in a courtroom, by way of advancing a
particular interest, present submissions
to that body.  Once the purpose of the
use of the information involved a disclosure to achieve the end of an
advancement of the plaintiff's
particular interest then any protection that
might otherwise had existed at the time of the creation of the material,
"<i>goes"</i>.
<P>

33	In this context Mr Nicholas (having referred to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a>
</i>(NSW) for the purposes of dealing with <b><i>Akins</i></b>), referred to
the different positions taken in the High Court in <b><i>Grant v Downs</i></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20135%20CLR%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 135 CLR 674.</a>  The dissenting position of Barwick CJ (now reflected in
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>), is set out at 677:
<P>

	<i>"Having considered the decisions, the writings and the various aspects of
the public interest which claim attention, I have come to
the conclusion that
the Court should state the relevant principle as follows: a document which was
produced or brought into existence
either with the dominant purpose of its
author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular
or general,
it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its
contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the
conduct of
litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect, should be
privileged and excluded from inspection".</i>
<P>

34	The particular statements in the judgment of the majority (Stephen, Mason,
Murphy JJ) upon which reliance was generally placed
to found the defendant's
position in this Motion were (at 682-3):
<P>

	<i>"It has been accepted that documents brought into existence after an
accident pursuant to a standing instruction previously given
may be privileged
... Although to sustain the privilege it is not necessary that the document has
been brought into existence on
the advice of the solicitor, it is essential
that the circumstances are such that the court can subsequently conclude,
viewing them
objectively, that litigation can be reasonably anticipated ... and
this at the time when the preparation of the document is undertaken.
However,
the fact that the document is brought into existence in anticipation of
litigation is not sufficient, without more, to attract
privilege; the document
must be called into being for use in litigation or for advice and it is the
extent to which this purpose
is intended to be served by the preparation of the
document that is in question".</i>
<P>

35	Further, at 688-9:
<P>

	<i>"All that we have said so far indicates that unless the law confines legal
professional privilege to those documents which are brought
into existence for
the sole purpose of submission to legal advisers for advice or for use in legal
proceedings the privilege will
travel beyond the underlying rationale to which
it is intended to give expression and will confer an advantage and immunity on
a
corporation which is not enjoyed by the ordinary individual. It is not right
that the privilege can attach to documents which, quite
apart from the purpose
of submission to a solicitor, would have been brought into existence for other
purposes in any event, and
then without attracting any attendant privilege. It
is true that the requirement that documents be brought into existence in
anticipation
of litigation diminishes to some extent the risk that documents
brought into existence for non-privileged purposes will attract the
privilege
but it certainly does not eliminate that risk. For this and the reasons which
we have expressed earlier we consider that
the sole purpose test should now be
adopted as the criterion of legal professional privilege. </i>
<P>

<i>	It is well accepted that the court in allowing production and inspection of
documents exercises a judicial discretion. In so    
doing it needs to
scrutinize with care claims of privilege made on the ground now under
consideration. It is for the party claiming
privilege to show that the
documents for which the claim is made are privileged. He may succeed in
achieving this objective by pointing
to the nature of the documents or by
evidence describing the circumstances in which they were brought into
existence. </i><cite>But it should not be thought that the privilege is
necessarily or conclusively established by resort to any verbal formula or
ritual.</cite><i> The court has power to examine the documents for itself, a
power which has perhaps been exercised too sparingly in the past, springing
possibly from a misplaced reluctance to go behind the formal claim of
privilege. It should not be forgotten that in many instances
the character of
the documents the subject of the claim will illuminate the purpose for which
they were brought into existence ...</i>
<P>

	<i>There was no doubt a reasonable anticipation that litigation might arise
out of the accident. This, however, does not overcome the
deficiency in point
of purpose which is revealed by the affidavits and the character of the
documents, for, as we have already observed,
the privilege requires </i><cite>a
combination of dedication to the stipulated purpose and reasonable anticipation
that litigation will ensue before it is attracted</cite><i>"</i> (emphasis
added)<i>.</i>
<P>

36	The emphasised passages underpin Mr Nicholas' general submissions.
<P>

37	Further, the approached advocated for the defendant will permit the
application of considerations of "<i>fairness"</i>:  <b><i>Attorney-General for
the Northern Territory v Maurice &amp; Ors</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 80</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20475" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 475</a>;

<P>

38	Thus far, it can be seen that the respective positions of the parties
starkly can be stated:  for the plaintiff it is contended
<b><i>Akins</i></b>
applies, for the defendant <b><i>Esso</i></b> and the common law.
<P>

39	On 12 March I drew to the attention of counsel a decision of the High Court
handed down on 11 March in<b> <i>Northern Territory of Australia v GP AO
(D172-1997)</i></b> [1999] HCA 8.
<P>

40	The defendant seized upon the statement of Gleeson CJ in paragraph 16:
<P>

	<i>"The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> applies to proceedings in the Family Court, as a court
created by the Parliament which is not the Supreme Court of a Territory. This
is the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> and the definition in the
Dictionary of "federal court". However, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> is concerned with the
adducing of evidence (Ch 2), the admissibility of evidence (Ch 3), proof (Ch 4)
and certain ancillary matters
(Ch 5). It does not deal with the obligations of
a party to whom an order in the nature of a subpoena is addressed to produce
documents
to the court in question. Nor does the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> deal with the
grant of leave by the court to inspect or otherwise make use of documents which
have been produced in answer to a subpoena".</i>
<P>

41	The attractiveness of that bare statement by his Honour is obvious. However,
the subject matter of his Honour's observation was
in the end irrelevant to the
determination of the issues before the High Court.  The appeal was concerned
essentially with the operation
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act, 1903</a></i> (Cth)
and relevant provisions of the <i>Northern Territory Community Welfare
</i>legislation.  Kirby J declined to consider the question of the effect of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, at all (paragraph 251);  see paragraphs 16-17 per
Gleeson CJ and Gummow J, 135 per Gaudron J, 199 per McHugh and Callinan JJ and
254 per Haine J.
<P>

42	It is, of course, inevitable that in an interlocutory proceeding the very
issue to which I have been referring should arise.
 It is as inopportune as it
is inappropriate, particularly in <i>this trial in progress</i>, that in an
interlocutory proceeding in effect within an interlocutory proceeding, in
effect within <i>a trial in progress</i>, that the trial judge embark upon
consideration of all the lines of authority, submissions and arguments and an
analysis of the judgments
that has lead to an apparent erection of a structure
by the Court of Appeal of this State and it deconstruction by the Full Federal
Court of Australia.
<P>

43	I propose to approach the resolution of the plaintiff's Motion on the basis
that the principles of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a></i> (NSW) (dealing with client
legal privilege), govern the question of whether documents produced on subpoena
or pursuant to a Notice
to Produce can be excluded from inspection by the
opposite side and to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal in
<b><i>Akins</i></b>.
<P>

	<b>The Evidence and The Materials</b>
<P>

44	The evidence for the plaintiff was constituted by an affidavit sworn 2 March
1999 by Wayne Flynn, Barrister;  two affidavits
(1 March and 2 March 1999) of
Michael Bryan Joshua Lee, Solicitor;  an affidavit of 1 March 1999 sworn by
Bryan James Whittaker,
Solicitor:  each of these deponents gave oral evidence.
For the defendant parts of an affidavit of Detective Superintendent Michael
Woodhouse sworn 2 March 1999 were read.  This deponent was not
cross-examined.
<P>

45	It is appropriate to commence with the evidence of <b>Mr Flynn</b>
(principally from the chronological perspective).  Mr Flynn deposes that on 13
March 1995 he was retained by the plaintiff's firm
of solicitors to assist the
plaintiff in taking witness statements to answer allegations of criminal
conduct made in the first publication
complained of the "<i>Today Tonight</i>"
program.  The primary purpose for which the statements were taken was to gather
material for the plaintiff's lawyers for advice
in respect to that publication
and for use in any defamation proceedings arising from the program.  Mr Flynn
had been informed by
the plaintiff that the plaintiff anticipated criminal
charges might be brought against him arising from the allegations of criminal
conduct made in the program and he himself believed that the material gathered
by him would be used by the plaintiff's solicitors
for such criminal
proceedings.  In short, he swears that he believed that the statutory
declarations gathered by him could be used
by the plaintiff's lawyers to advise
the plaintiff in relation to any such proceedings, for use as evidence in such
proceedings,
and if necessary, to try to persuade the investigating and
prosecuting authorities not to initiate criminal proceedings against the
plaintiff.
<P>

46	In November 1995 Mr Flynn was retained by Phillips Fox, the plaintiff's
solicitors in the defamation proceedings, to take statements
from witnesses for
the purposes of those proceedings.  The letter of retainer is annexed to the
affidavit.  He continued to take
statutory declarations for use as proofs of
evidence until the end of 1995.  In 1996 he also took some further statements
for use
in those proceedings and anticipated criminal proceedings against the
plaintiff.
<P>

47	The plaintiff had provided Mr Flynn with the names of people to assist in
responding to the allegations him.  Apparently, Mr
Flynn also suggested other
people from whom statements should be obtained to assist.  Mr Flynn deposes to
his general practice as
to making arrangements to meeting with various
witnesses, taking notes of what the person said, writing out the statements,
providing
them to a secretary at Marsdens to type as statutory declarations and
arrangements for their execution.  Mr Flynn never witnessed
any of the
statutory declarations.  In final form they would be given to the plaintiff or
left with the plaintiff's secretary.  Any
notes that Mr Flynn took of the
conversations leading to the creation of the statutory declarations have since
been destroyed.
<P>

48	Exhibited to Mr Flynn's affidavit are fourteen statutory declarations
(marked WF: 1 - 14 and MFI 11 - 24).  The range of dates
of the statutory
declarations are from 22 March 1995 to 6 February 1996.  They are the statutory
declarations of persons described
as P30, P31, P32, P2, P33, P34, P35, P36,
P37, P38, P39, P40, P41 and P42:  MFI 25 lists the pseudonyms and the names of
those people
are included in MFI 26 (confidential).
<P>

49	In his affidavit Mr Flynn deposes to the circumstances attending the
creation of each of the fourteen statutory declarations.
 To what he there
deposes I accept generally as conforming with the practice he adopted and the
purpose for which he deposed the
statutory declarations were brought into
existence, and with his oral evidence.
<P>

50	Copies of the documents (WF:  1 - 14;  MFI 11 - 24) became attachments to
document number 4 in confidential exhibit BJW 1, being
a statutory declaration
of a person described as "<i>P1</i>" dated May 1996;  I shall return to that
document in due course.  The statutory declaration being WF: 4/MFI 14 of P2
also became
an attachment to document 1(a) and document 20(a) in confidential
exhibit BJW 4.  BJW 1 is an exhibit to the affidavit of Mr Whittaker
affirmed 1
March 1999 and is a folder of documents sourced in the plaintiff and produced
pursuant to the Notice to Produce.  BJW
4 is a folder of documents exhibited to
the same affidavit of Mr Whittaker being documents sourced in material produced
by the Police
pursuant to the subpoena.  The "<i>migration</i>" of documents
brought into existence pursuant to endeavours of Mr Flynn will be of
significance.  I add that Mr Flynn had no direct
knowledge of what became of
the originals of the statutory declarations with which he dealt.
<P>

51	In his oral evidence Mr Flynn stated that he commenced taking statements
from about the time of the publication of the "<i>Today Tonight</i>" program,
as I understood it, in connection with that program, and that within a week of
the program he was informed by the plaintiff
that the plaintiff anticipated
that criminal charges might be brought against him arising from the allegations
in the program.
<P>

52	With respect to the view that the documents would be used to persuade
investigating authorities not to proceed, Mr Flynn said
that was a possibility
dependent upon the advice Mr Marsden received from his lawyers.  Certainly for
a short period he had that
expectation as to a purpose of obtaining the
statutory declarations.  However, in April or May of 1995, as I understand Mr
Flynn's
evidence, he received information from a retired police officer known
to him personally that that officer had been informed by somebody
in the Task
Force investigating the plaintiff that the allegations against the plaintiff
did not seem to be standing up to scrutiny
and that it was highly unlikely that
there would be any charges laid.  That information was passed on by Mr Flynn to
Mr Marsden.
 The retired police officer, Detective Sergeant George Slade, did
not provide to Mr Flynn the identity of the source of information
within the
Task Force and Mr Flynn did not seek it.  In the light of the information Mr
Slade had provided to Mr Flynn, as far as
Mr Flynn was concerned, the purpose
of gathering the statutory declarations to dissuade the authorities was no
longer his expectation.
 As far as the oral evidence is concerned it is clear
to me that Mr Flynn was instructed to gather the statutory declarations with
respect to the Channel 7 allegations;  his subjective views however were that
they could be available for the other purposes.
<P>

53	Mr Flynn was instructed by Corrs Chambers Westgarth (CCW/Corrs) who at that
time in 1995 were the solicitors for the plaintiff
particularly in respect of
the defamation action arising from the first program;  he provided the
statutory declarations to Marsdens
and did not draw to the attention of the
plaintiff's presents solicitors, Phillips Fox and in particular Mr Potter and,
as I understand
it, anyone else, the existence of the statutory declarations.

<P>

54	I turn to the evidence of <b>Mr Brian James Whittaker</b>, Solicitor of
Corrs and the documents to which he refers. 
<P>

55	Mr Whittaker under the supervision of various partners of Corrs was involved
in providing legal representation to the plaintiff
in relation to the first
defamation action (20223/95 "<i>Today Tonight"</i>);  the investigation by the
New South Wales Police Service relating to allegations of criminal conduct by
the plaintiff which commenced
around mid-March 1995 and investigations by the
Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service concerning allegations
of
criminal conduct by the plaintiff, which investigations commenced around
late December 1994 or early in 1995.  Mr Whittaker's affidavit
of sixty five
paragraphs, together with the two substantial folders of documents exhibited,
constitutes the bulk of the material
for consideration and is of some
complexity.  The first part of the affidavit deals with the "<i>background to
instructions and retainer of Corrs</i>".  Mr Whittaker first met the plaintiff
on or about 2 December 1994, the day following the tabling in the Lower House
of the New
South Wales Parliament by Mrs Deidre Grusovin, the Member for
Heffron, of a statutory declaration of one Colin Fisk of 21 October
1994.  The
plaintiff retained Corrs to act on his behalf in relation to that event on
either the first or second of December 1994.
 
<P>

56	In or about December 1994 or January 1995 the plaintiff became aware that
the defendant was investigating his affairs and may
intend to broadcast a story
about him.  Corrs were retained by the plaintiff from about mid-January 1995
(it could have been earlier)
to provide professional legal services in respect
to the anticipated broadcast and any proceedings for defamation arising from
it.
<P>

57	Following the events in the NSW Parliament, the Terms of Reference of the
Royal Commission were amended to inquire into, amongst
other things, the
impartiality of the Police Service in investigating and/or pursuing
prosecutions for paedophile activity.  This
amendment to the Terms of Reference
took place on 21 December 1994.  From in or around early January 1995 Corrs
were retained by
the plaintiff in connection with the Royal Commissions
investigations.  
<P>

58	On 13 March 1995 "<i>Today Tonight</i>" was telecast and instructions were
immediately given to Corrs to institute the defamation action, the Statement of
Claim being filed
on 14 March 1995.
<P>

59	On or about 14 March the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Service
established a Task Force to investigate the criminal
allegations concerning the
plaintiff.  Corrs' retainer was extended by the plaintiff to cover that Police
Service investigation on
or about that day.
<P>

60	It was in mid-March 1995 that the plaintiff withdrew his instructions from
Corrs relating to the defamation action and instructed
Phillips Fox to provide
him with legal services in respect of those proceedings.  From mid-March 1995
Corrs was retained by the plaintiff
in respect of the investigations by the New
South Wales Police Service and the Royal Commission.  Phillips Fox instituted
proceedings
arising from "<i>Witness</i>" program on 7 May 1996 and its
retainer from the plaintiff in relation to the defamation actions has
continued.
<P>

61	The next component of Mr Whittaker's affidavit related to "<i>background to
preparation of statements and statutory declarations"</i>.  Shortly after Corrs
was retained by the plaintiff, Mr Marsden informed the deponent that he would
be retaining his own firm, Marsdens,
to act on his behalf in gathering and
preparing materials to demonstrate his innocence of the "<i>Grusovin
allegations" </i>and in anticipation of any proceedings that might be commenced
out of those allegations.  That arrangement continued through the period
of
Corrs retainer as the plaintiff's "<i>brief</i>" to that firm expanded.  Mr
Whittaker deposes to a conversation with the plaintiff in December 1994 or
early 1995 touching upon this
arrangement and it appears that it was put in
place as a cost saving measure.  In any event, as a result of what Mr Whittaker
describes
as a "<i>limitation</i>" on Corrs' retainer, the majority of
statements and statutory declarations subsequently prepared relating to the
Police Service investigations
and the Royal Commission were prepared by
Marsdens.  Information as to the preparation of these statutory declarations
was given
to Mr Whittaker by the plaintiff.  This was the usual practice,
(objection was taken to parts of the affidavit relating thereto),
in place over
the relevant times.
<P>

62	The next component of Mr Whittaker's affidavit concerned "<i>documents
produced to, and communication with the NSW Police Service and Royal Commission
into the NSW Police Service"</i>.
<P>

63	Documents were provided to the Police during meetings at which the plaintiff
was not present, during interviews or around the
time of interviews by the
Police.  The deponent states that the documents were provided by the
plaintiff's lawyers in the course
of cooperating with Police inquiries and in
particular with a view to demonstrating objectively to the police the falsity
of the
allegations made against the plaintiff.  Apparently some discussions
took place relating to the production of material to the Police
with a
Detective Inspector Inkster and other officers working on the investigation.
It was the deponent's practice to indicate to
whomsoever the documents were
being produced that the plaintiff had instructed him to provide the documents
to the Police and that
the production was "<i>confidential and given to you for
the purpose of the inquiry only</i>".  
<P>

64	As to the Police Royal Commission, the plaintiff's lawyers provided material
pursuant to notices issued under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission (Police
Service) Act 1994</a></i>;  (said by the <i>"deponent</i>" to be under compulsion
of law) and in <i>"anticipation of receiving <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notices where the
plaintiff had been given notice prior to their issue"</i>.
<P>

65	The first occasion the deponent can recall the plaintiff producing documents
to the Commission was on 1 March 1995 when he and
the plaintiff attended an
interview, on a voluntary basis, with Ms Bergin, counsel assisting the
Commission and a Mr Nicholas, believed
to be a solicitor employed by the
Commission.  To the best of the deponent's recollection on that occasion the
documents were produced
pursuant to a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice of which a copy has not been
retained.  A pattern apparently was established, to the best of the deponent's
recollection,
to the effect that he would speak with Ms Bergin during the days
prior to the interview and discuss production of various documents
in the
plaintiff's possession.  One conversation is deposed to between a partner of
the deponent, Mr McCann, and Ms Bergin at the
end of which words were
attributed to the latter to the effect that if the plaintiff was willing to
attend an interview Ms Bergin
would be available, he should bring whatever
documents he has and "<i>we will deal with what we have discussed</i>".  Ms
Bergin is deposed to have said words to the effect "<i>we will issue you with a
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice and you can hand over the documents upon receipt tomorrow"</i>.
<P>

66	On most occasions documents were produced to the Royal Commission "<i>under
compulsion</i>".  According to the deponent the production was on a
confidential basis for the purposes of assisting the Commission only.  It was
his understanding that the documents would not be provided to "<i>third
parties</i>" and that the Commission in fact did not do so.  The nature of the
information, he deposes, was inherently confidential and the view
he formed was
based on statements made to him by lawyers and officers acting for the Royal
Commission.  By way of example, he could
recall a disagreement with Royal
Commission staff in or about late May or early June 1995 concerning an
interview subsequently given
by the plaintiff to the Commission.  The
Commission refused to provide the plaintiff with copies of the transcripts of
the interview
and a Mr Stewart of the Royal Commission is reported as saying
words to the effect that the Royal Commission does not release any
documents
because it cannot risk the integrity of the Royal Commission's documents being
compromised.  The <i>"transcript and documents received are confidential
records of the Commission</i>".  
<P>

67	The next component of Mr Whittaker's affidavit deals with "<i>documents
produced on subpoena by the plaintiff</i>".  Annexure A to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit is the relevant subpoena.  Confidential exhibit BJW 1 (MFI 5) is the
bundle of documents
prepared by Phillips Fox over which privilege is claimed on
behalf of the plaintiff.  A schedule annexed to Mr Whittaker's affidavit
and
marked "<i>B"</i> tabulates the sixteen documents that constitute BJW 1.
<P>

68	The first document with which Mr Whittaker deals is document 2 described as
"<i>copy of statutory declaration of John Marsden dated 27 June 1996 attaching
(a) copy of letter from Royal Commission (Crooke) to Corrs
Chambers Westgarth
(CCW - Whittaker) dated 19 June 1996 and (b) copy of statutory declaration of
John Marsden dated 13 June 1995"</i>.  Mr Whittaker requested the plaintiff to
prepare this document in response to a request from the Royal Commission dated
19 June
1996. That request is annexure A to the statutory declaration of 27
June 1996.  Annexure B to the statutory declaration of John Marsden
made 27
June 1996 (document 2) is another statutory declaration.  This other statutory
declaration is described by Mr Whittaker in
his affidavit as being one dated 31
May 1995.  It is not.  It is dated 13 June 1995.  It is correctly described as
such in annexure
B to the affidavit as document 2(b).  The statutory
declaration dated 13 June 1995 annexed to the statutory declaration of 27 June
1996 (document 2) was brought into existence pursuant to the service of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a>
notice dated 31 May 1995, that notice being annexure C to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit.  The statutory declaration dated 27 June 1996
(document 2) together
with its two enclosures was prepared by Marsdens in the period mid to late June
1996.  The earlier statutory
declaration dated 13 June 1995 was prepared by Mr
Marsden at the deponent's request upon receipt of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> notice.
<P>

69	Document 3:  copies a statutory declaration of John Marsden dated 12 July
1996.  This statutory declaration, to the best of the
deponent's understanding,
was prepared by Mr Marsden or a member of his firm for the purpose of
responding to a letter form the Royal
Commission to Corrs dated 8 July 1996.
The original of this statutory declaration was provided by Corrs to the Royal
Commission.
 The letter dated 8 July 1996 became Exhibit 1 tendered by the
defendant on the plaintiff's Notice of Motion to preclude inspection.
 I shall
deal further with that when I return to Mr Whittaker's oral evidence.
<P>

70	Document 4 in MJW 1 is described in annexure B to Mr Whittaker's affidavit
as "<i>copy of statutory declaration of John Marsden dated May 1996 with
attachments".  </i>It is four centimetres thick.  Among those attachments are
the fourteen statutory declarations, WF 1 - 14 (MFI 11 - 24) in respect
of
which Mr Flynn gave evidence.  In relation to this document 4, Mr Whittaker
cannot recall whether a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice was received.  Annexed to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit and marked "<i>C"</i> is a letter from him to the Royal Commission
for the attention of Patti Bergin (sic).  That letter became Exhibit 2 tendered
by the
defendant on the plaintiff's Motion.  Exhibit 2 (the Whittaker/Bergin
letter) is in the following terms:  
<P>

	<i>"We enclose Statutory Declaration of John Marsden dated 8 May 1996.</i>
<P>

<i>	The statutory declaration is produced to the Royal Commission on our
client's instructions.  Some of the annexures to the statutory
declaration are
subject to legal professional privilege.  Our client waives legal professional
privilege with respect to those annexures.
 Legal professional privilege in
relation to communications between our client and his legal advisers about the
annexures and/or
any other privileged communications with respect to the
annexures is not waived".</i>
<P>

71	In more respects than one, it quite arguably can be said that this is a most
unhelpful communication.  First, it fails to identify
which of the annexures to
the statutory declaration are subject to legal professional privilege which is
waived. Nor does it discriminate
the communications in respect of which
privilege is maintained.  Over objection, Mr Whittaker in paragraph 27 of his
affidavit states
that all he intended by the words was to "<i>decline to claim
privilege with respect to the Royal Commission</i>".  He did not intend or
understand himself to be waiving privilege to the <i>"world at large</i>".  He
reiterates that the material was provided to the Royal Commission on a
<i>"strictly confidential basis</i>" for the use by the Royal Commission for
the purpose of its investigations.  
<P>

72	Document 5 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B to Mr Whittaker's affidavit
as a statutory declaration dated 18 April 1997.  He
prepared that statutory
declaration for the purpose of providing the plaintiff with professional legal
services relating to anticipated
criminal proceedings against the plaintiff and
professional legal advice relating to investigations of the plaintiff by the
Royal
Commission.  In paragraph 28 of the affidavit dealing with this document
Mr Whittaker deposes that he cannot recall the exact time
of its production to
the "<i>NSW Police</i>" (<i>sic</i>) but believes it accorded with the practice
of <i>"confidentiality</i>" referred to earlier in the affidavit (paragraph 21)
in relation to dealings with the Royal Commission:  a little confusion here.
<P>

73	Document 6 in BJW 1, according to annexure B to the affidavit of Mr
Whittaker, is a copy of "<i>statement of John Marsden (undated)".</i>  This
document was prepared by the plaintiff or Marsdens, it is said, for the sole
purpose of providing the plaintiff with professional
legal services relating to
anticipated criminal proceedings against him.  The best that Mr Whittaker could
do in relation to document
6 was state that it "<i>may</i>" have been provided
to the Royal Commission pursuant to a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> notice.
<P>

74	Document 7 in BJW 1, according to annexure B to Mr Whittaker's affidavit, is
a copy of "<i>statement of John Marsden dated 6 March 1995"</i>.  This document
was prepared by the plaintiff at Mr Whittaker's request.  A copy of the
statement was sent to the Royal Commission.
 A confidential exhibit marked
"<i>BJW 3" </i>to the affidavit of Mr Whittaker is a true copy of a letter sent
by him on 8 March 1995 which enclosed document 7.  To the best of
Mr
Whittaker's recollection, a copy of the document was provided to the Royal
Commission in compliance with a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice dated 16 May 1995 (which post-dates
the date of the statement).  That <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice is annexure D to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit.  The schedule to that notice is in the following terms:
<P>

	"<i>1)	All Statements, statutory declarations or other documents including,
but not limited to, notes of meetings, correspondence, audio
tapes and
computer-generated records relating to allegations that John Robert Marsden is
a pederast.</i>
<P>

	<i>2)	All statements, statutory declarations or other documents including, but
not limited to, notes of meetings, correspondence, audio
tapes and
computer-generated records in relation to the search warrant executed upon the
house of John Robert Marsden in May 1994
and also in relation to any allegation
of drug use by John Robert Marsden".</i>
<P>

75	As to document 8 in BJW 1 it is described in annexure B to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit as a "<i>copy of a statutory declaration of John Marsden dated 21
March 1995"</i>.  This document, it is contended by the deponent, was prepared
for the sole purpose of the provision of professional legal services
relating
to the first defamation proceedings.  (I interpose here that the terminology
employed in paragraph 31 of Mr Whittaker's
affidavit appears to be that of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
119</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> the commencement of which post-dates the
statutory declaration).  A copy of that statutory declaration was forwarded to
the Royal
Commission to comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice which is annexure D to Mr
Whittaker's affidavit.
<P>

76	Document 9 in BJW 1, described in annexure B as "<i>copy of statutory
declaration of John Marsden dated 21 March 1995",</i> was forwarded to the
Royal Commission pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice, annexure D.  It was said that it
was prepared by Marsdens for the "<i>sole purpose of providing the plaintiff
with legal services relating to anticipated criminal proceedings against the
plaintiff"</i>.
<P>

77	Document 10 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B as a "<i>copy of statutory
declaration of John Marsden dated 21 March 1995</i>".  The statutory
declaration was prepared by the plaintiff or solicitor in his employ at
Marsdens for the purpose referred to as
"<i>providing the plaintiff will legal
advice relating to the Royal Commission which was investigating the
plaintiff</i>".  A copy of that statutory declaration was provided to the Royal
Commission to comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice, being annexure B.
<P>

78	Document 11 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B as "<i>copy of statutory
declaration of John Marsden dated 21 March 1995"</i>.  This was prepared by the
plaintiff or Marsdens in relation to the provision of professional legal
services relating to the first
defamation action and a copy was forwarded to
the Royal Commission in compliance with a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice which is annexure D.  
<P>

79	Document 12 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B to Mr Whittaker's affidavit
as a "<i>copy of statutory declaration of John Marsden dated 21 March
1995"</i>.  It was prepared by the plaintiff or a solicitor in Marsdens in
connection with or as is stated, for the <i>"sole purpose of</i>" the provision
to the plaintiff of professional legal services relating to the first
defamation action and it also was forwarded
to the Royal Commission in
compliance with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice being annexure D.
<P>

80	Document 13 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B as a "<i>copy of statutory
declaration of John Marsden dated 23 March 1995</i>"  It was prepared by the
plaintiff or a solicitor at Marsdens for the purposes of providing the
plaintiff with legal advice relating
to the Royal Commission.  To the best of
Mr Whittaker's recollection it was prepared by the plaintiff at his request and
a copy was
forwarded to the Royal Commission to comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice,
annexure D.
<P>

81	Document 14 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B as a "<i>copy of statement
of John Marsden (undated)"</i>.  This was prepared by the plaintiff to obtain
professional legal services in relation to anticipated criminal proceedings and
was
done so by the plaintiff at Mr Whittaker's request.  It was forwarded to
the Royal Commission in compliance with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice, annexure D.
<P>

82	Document 15 in BJW 1 described in annexure B as "<i>copy of statement of
John Marsden (undated)".</i>  This document was prepared in the offices of
Corrs for the purpose of providing the plaintiff with professional legal advice
relating
to the Royal Commission and a copy was forwarded to that body to
comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice, annexure D.
<P>

83	Document 16 in BJW 1 is described in annexure B as "<i>copy of statement of
John Marsden (undated)"</i>.  This document was prepared by the plaintiff for
the purpose of the plaintiff being provided with professional legal advice
relating
to the Royal Commission which was investigating him and a copy of that
statutory declaration was provided to the Royal Commission
to comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
7</a> Notice, annexure D.
<P>

84	I turn now to that component of Mr Whittaker's affidavit which deals with
"<i>documents Produced on Subpoena by Police</i>".  Confidential exhibit BJW 4
to Mr Whittaker's affidavit is comprised of documents produced by the Police
Service to the Court over
which the plaintiff maintains a claim for privilege.
Annexure E to Mr Whittaker's affidavit is a schedule of those documents.
Confidential
exhibit BJW 5 to Mr Whittaker's affidavit is a document to which I
have already referred (paragraph 48) being MFI 26 which identifies
by name the
persons to whom the numbers P1 - P42 have been allocated.  In annexure E to Mr
Whittaker's affidavit there is reference
to forty four documents.
<P>

85	Document 1 is described in annexure E as the statutory declaration of P1
dated May 1986 (edited copy) attaching fifteen statutory
declarations.  It is
described as an edited version of document 4 in annexure B.  Annexure B
discloses that it is that statutory
declaration of John Marsden dated May 1996
with attachments.  Thus, one does not have to be a cryptologist to identify P1
as the
plaintiff.  The attachment to document 1 described as "<i>(a) statutory
declaration of P2 dated 8 February 1996 attaching a statutory declaration of P2
dated 12 December 1995</i>" discloses that the latter is the same document as
is WF4 (MFI 14) to which Mr Flynn refers in his evidence.  Thus, the particular
statutory declaration dated 12 December 1995 from P2 being WF 4 (MFI 14)
appears to have found its way to the Royal Commission by
reference to being
part of document 4 in BJW 1 and in some way unknown to have found its way into
the possession of the Police Service.
 None of the other attachments to
document 1 in annexure E, being attachments to the plaintiff's statutory
declaration of May 1996
in the possession of the Police, were documents with
which Mr Flynn was concerned in his evidence.
<P>

86	Documents 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 being statutory declarations of the following and
dated respectively, P24 5 June 1996, P25 17 June
1996, P27 19 June 1996, P9 19
June 1996, and P11 19 June 1996 were provided to Mr Whittaker by the plaintiff.
A copy of each was
forwarded to the Royal Commission following the issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
7</a> Notice.  The letter forwarding to the Royal Commission copies of these
statutory declarations (though in edited form) is Exhibit
3 tendered by the
defendant on the plaintiff's Motion.
<P>

87	Documents 4 and 6 being respectively statutory declarations of P26 and P28
dated 10 May 1996 and 22 May 1996 as set out in annexure
E were provided to Mr
Whittaker by the plaintiff and copies were provided to the Royal Commission
following the issue of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice.
<P>

88	Document 8 being a statutory declaration of P10 dated 5 June 1996 was
prepared by Mr Whittaker and forwarded to the Royal Commission
following the
issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice.
<P>

89	Documents 10, 11 and 12 being statutory declarations of P2, 8 February 1996
(without annexure), P12, 28 November 1995, P13 (undated),
to the best of Mr
Whittaker's recollection were provided to him by the plaintiff and subsequently
provided to the Royal Commission.
 In paragraph 46 of his affidavit Mr
Whittaker candidly states that his recollection of the circumstances of their
provision to the
Royal Commission and "<i>to the Police</i>" is unclear.  
<P>

90	Document 14 described in annexure E as "<i>statutory declaration of P13
dated 31 July 1996"</i> was provided by the plaintiff.  Annexure F to the
affidavit is a copy of a facsimile dated 5 August 1996 to Detective Inspector
Inkster
of the New South Wales Police Service attaching a copy of document 14.
Annexure F to Mr Whittaker's affidavit is an "<i>open</i>" document which
states "<i>please find enclosed a copy of the signed statutory declaration of
(named inserted)"</i>.  Thus, the identify of P13 as sworn in document 14 is
disclosed in exhibit F.  
<P>

91	Document 15 referred to in annexure E is a statutory declaration of P1 dated
18 April 1997.  It is a copy of the statutory declaration
of the plaintiff of
that date being document 5 in BJW 1, (see paragraph 72 above hereof).
<P>

92	Document 16 in annexure E described as a statutory declaration of P13 is a
copy of document 14 in annexure E (see paragraph 81
above).
<P>

93	Document 17 is made up of a statutory declaration of P28 dated 8 March 1995,
a statutory declaration of P29 dated 8 March 1995
and a statement of P1
(unsigned and undated).  A copy of each of these documents was provided by
Corrs to the Police under cover
of a letter dated 28 March 1995 which is
annexed to Mr Whittaker's affidavit and marked "<i>G"</i>.  That is also a
"<i>open</i>" exhibit which on any reasonable construction discloses the third
component of document 17 to be a statement of the plaintiff (originally
described as "<i>unsigned and undated</i>") as a statutory declaration dated 13
March 1995 of the plaintiff but not sworn.
<P>

94	Document 18 is described in annexure E as "<i>edited statutory declaration
of the plaintiff dated 9 June 1995"</i>.  This was prepared by the plaintiff or
by solicitors in the employ of Marsdens for the purpose of responding to a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a>
Notice believed by the deponent, Mr Whittaker, to be that Notice which is
annexure C to his affidavit which is a Notice issued pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> of the Act
dated 31 May 1995.
<P>

95	Document 19 is an edited version of document 2 in annexure B to Mr
Whittaker's affidavit which is a statutory declaration of
the plaintiff dated
27 June 1996 (see paragraph 68 above hereof).
<P>

96	Document 20 in annexure E, as I understand it from paragraph 53 of Mr
Whittaker's affidavit is another form of document 1 in
annexure E being the
statutory declaration of the plaintiff (edited copy) to which was attached the
fifteen statutory declarations
to which I make reference in paragraph 85
above.
<P>

97	Documents 21 to 31 are copies of documents 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
and 12 in annexure E.
<P>

98	Document 32 is a statutory declaration of Bekir Erkilic of 27 June 1995 in
respect of which privilege has been expressly waived
by a communication to me
dated 11 March 1999. 
<P>

99	Document 33 is a statutory declaration of P15 dated 19 December 1994.  The
deponent states that a copy was provided to him by
the plaintiff and his
recollection was unclear but he believes that a copy was subsequently made
available to the police.
<P>

100	With respect to document 38 (whatever it was), annexure E states that
privilege is no longer claimed over it.
<P>

101	Document 34 is described as "<i>part of paragraph 2 on page 2 of a NSW
Police running sheet created 11 August 1998 re statement obtained by the Police
from D16 on
11 August 1998</i>".  The defendant has a copy of this document
however edited out are two lines that relate to the contents of two statutory
declarations
of the plaintiff in respect of which contents privilege is
claimed.
<P>

102	Document 35 is part of paragraph 52 of a statement of D16 to the Police
dated 11 August 1998 which has been edited in the same
manner and for the same
reason.  BJW 4 being the folder of "<i>Police</i>" documents in respect of
which privilege is claimed and to which I have access, contains unedited
versions of these documents.  
<P>

103	Document 36 is described as "<i>part of paragraph 3 of page 1 of a NSW
Police running sheet created on 14 September 1998 re telephone conversation
with D16 on 14
September 1998</i>".  This has been edited for the same
reason.
<P>

104	Document 37, according to annexure E, contains parts of paragraphs from a
statement of D16 dated 3 December 1998 which has been
edited.
<P>

105	Document 39, according to annexure E, contains part of paragraph 11 of a
statutory declaration of one Deanne Maynard dated 12
August 1998 from which one
and a bit lines have been excised for the same reason.
<P>

106	Document 40, according to annexure E is "<i>part of paragraph 18 of the
statutory declaration of Pamela Kent dated 13 August 1998</i>" from which again
a line and a bit have been excised for the same reason.
<P>

107	Document 41 is a statutory declaration of D16 dated 29 July 1996.
<P>

108	Document 42, 43 and 44 are statutory declarations of P16 dated 28 September
1998, 27 October 1998 and 10 December 1998.
<P>

109	Mr Whittaker gives no affidavit evidence in connection with annexure E
relating to document 13 being part of a statutory declaration
of P16 dated 10
December 1998, documents 35, 36, 37, 39 - 44.  Further, in relation to annexure
B document 1 described as "<i>copy of statutory declaration of John Marsden
dated 25 November 1998 with attachments consisting of other documents</i>"
being the first of the documents produced by the plaintiff over which privilege
is claimed, Mr Whittaker makes no reference in his
affidavit.
<P>

110	I turn to the oral evidence given by Mr Whittaker.  In relation to the
Police receiving documents and information, it was Mr
Whittaker's recollection
that it was he personally who handed over documents.  Other members of his
employing firm who would have
been involved were Mr McKeogh, Mr McCann and Mr
Lee.  The general purpose was initially described (T194.55) as the provision of
documents
on the plaintiff's instructions "<i>of course it is confidential and
is given to you </i>[the Police]<i> for the purpose of the inquiry</i>".
Documents were handed by Mr Whittaker to Mr Inkster, Head of the Task Force
established on 14 March 1995.  I gather the witness
dealt principally with Mr
Inkster and one Sergeant Eris Shields.  
<P>

111	When asked for the first time what was the witness' expectation as to what
would happen to the document Mr Whittaker replied
(T195.50-56):
<P>

	"<i>A.	My expectation was that were providing material to the police
generally, and I say that because I am not clear on exactly what
we gave to
them at this point but generally with the purpose of demonstrating to them that
matters that we believed were the subject
of inquiry could on an objective
basis be availed of by the police as having at least a reasonable doubt or
being groundless".</i>
<P>

112	He also agreed that he would have expected that the material made available
to the Police would have been used by the various
individuals in the task force
to assist them with them inquiries and investigations (T196.9).  He could not
be sure of the proposition
that he would envisage that the Police
investigations assisted by such documents as they saw fit to use, would involve
interviewing
people.  He was generally aware of the nature of the Task Force
inquiry but "<i>The information that was provided to the Police was provided
for the purposes of showing them that objectively the matters that we
were
aware of that were subject of the investigation could be challenged on an
objective basis"</i> (T196.20).
<P>

113	He agreed that it was fair comment that he would trust the police officers
to whom he was handing over the information to rely
upon it to assist them in
furthering their investigations to the end that the investigations were brought
to an end as soon as possible.
 He would not however expect the Police to
swallow the information "<i>holus bolus</i>" but he would have expected, where
the information was clear, that they would not need to take it necessarily any
further (T196.45).
<P>

114	In response to the suggestion that he would have had the expectation that
the police officer may very well put some of the information
to the persons who
had made allegations against Mr Marsden to challenge them, was that the police
officer "<i>may well have informed him or herself of the material"</i>.
<P>

115	At 197.5 there commenced the following exchange:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  And indeed I suggest to you sensibly that you indeed provided this
material to enable the police officers again if  they saw
fit to do so in their
discretion in order to achieve the end you were hoping to achieve to do just
that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  As I say the principal purpose of providing the documents was to
demonstrate on an objective basis there was nothing in the allegations.
If the
police informed themselves through the material of matters, yes that would be a
sensible conclusion that would go on and it
was certainly never the intention
the documents would be shown to other people. </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Putting the document to one side, plainly enough for the information in
the document to do the work you were hoping it would
do, you would expect the
policeman to be putting that information to the, in order to test so as to
demonstrate the unreliability
of the allegations that had been made, you would
expect that wouldn't you? </i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I am not, I am not familiar enough with police investigations to know
whether or not they would go off and put things to third
parties in that way.
As I say, in providing the information the principal object was to demonstrate
to the police that there was
an objective basis upon which to doubt the
information they had been provided with. </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Is this a fair way of summing-up the situation so far as you were
concerned and consistent with your instructions, that the material
was handed
over for the police officers to use in furthering their inquiries as they saw
fit in their discretion? </i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No I would not go that far, no".</i>
<P>

116	This evidence gives rise to a consideration of the expectations as to
confidentiality, the reality of the confidentiality and
the extent of the
confidentiality between the plaintiff and his lawyers and the police.  Mr
Whittaker's evidence is not dissimilar
to that, to which I will shortly refer,
given by Mr Lee. 
<P>

117	In relation to the production of documents to the Royal Commission, Mr
Whittaker identified the "<i>compulsion</i>" as responses to Notices issued
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission (Police Service) Act 1994</a></i>.  He
agreed that upon receipt of any such Notice he would consider the terms of the
relevant section of the legislation.  He had
no particular recollection of any
claim for "<i>privilege</i>" being made as provided for by the terms of the
Notice or the Act.  He could not recall on any occasion when steps were taken
to
set aside any Notice.
<P>

118	As to taking objection it does turn out from Exhibit 3, a letter to the
Royal Commission in response to a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> Notice the statutory declarations
therewith provided were "<i>produced on objection</i>".
<P>

119	In relation to document 2 in annexure B to his affidavit which was a copy
of a statutory declaration of the plaintiff dated
27 June 1996 attaching a copy
of a letter from the Commission dated 19 June 1996 and a copy of a statutory
declaration of the plaintiff
dated 13 June 1995 (see paragraph 68 above), Mr
Whittaker clarified that the second mentioned statutory declaration was based
upon
a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> Notice.  But in respect to document 2 otherwise no claim for
privilege or objection was taken.  It was Mr Whittaker's recollection
that the
genesis of that document (document 2) was discussions between Royal Commission
staff and Mr Greg James Q.C. (as he then
was).  Mr James had contacted him and
said that he had had discussions with Royal Commission staff and that on the
basis of those
discussions a letter would issue and that he would provide
material responding to it.  That was how document 2 "<i>came to pass</i>".
<P>

120	Exhibit 1, a letter dated 8 July 1996 from the Royal Commission to Corrs,
was acknowledged to be the document referred to in
paragraph 26 of the
witnesses affidavit dealing with document 3, a letter which I gather was
delivered at a time when there were
discussions concerning the possibility of
"<i>statement"</i> by the Royal Commission.  All I can understand from the
evidence is that the material was provided in connection with the <i>"public
statement</i>".  The document was prepared on the witness's request by the
plaintiff or someone in the plaintiff's office and was prepared for
the purpose
of responding to Exhibit 1.  At the time of the preparation of document 3 the
witness said it was not known whether or
not a statement would be made.  A
letter was provided to the plaintiff, that is, Exhibit 1, with a request that
he deal with the
two matters raised by it and subsequently this caused document
3 to be sent to the Royal Commission.  Mr Whittaker would not agree
that he
contemplated the likelihood that the document made well have been referred to
in any public session in which a public statement
was to be made in the
Commission.  His understanding of the discussions that were taking place at
that time was that what he was
looking here for and what was being discussed
was a statement of a general nature.  Mr Whittaker went on to say (T207.29):
"<i>that statement was subsequently made</i>".  By that I take him to mean a
statement in public session of the Royal Commission.  That was clear to me on
hearing that piece
of evidence.  I have heard nothing nor received any evidence
as to the nature and content of that statement made in public session
of the
Royal Commission.  He agreed that any statement made in public session of the
Royal Commission was for the "<i>benefit of mankind</i>".  He did not agree
that the information provided in response to Exhibit 1 was for use by the Royal
Commission staff as "<i>they saw fit</i>" in dealing with the contents of a
public statement.
<P>

121	As to document 5 in annexure B to Mr Whittaker's affidavit referred to in
paragraph 28 (statutory declaration of the plaintiff
dated 18 April 1997), the
witness seemed to recall a conversation with Mr Inkster relating to the inquiry
moving along, references
to the <i>"Witness"</i> program and his saying to Mr
Inkster that he would discuss the matter with the plaintiff and provide him
"<i>confidentiality</i>" material subject to instructions from Mr Marsden.  He
assisted the plaintiff in the preparation of the document and it was provided
to Mr Inkster on a confidential basis for the purpose of providing legal advice
and in response to his request.
<P>

122	As I understand the course of the evidence after dealing with this
particular document 5, there was admitted into evidence Exhibit
2 (see
paragraph 70 above).
<P>

123	Exhibit 2 is the letter from Mr Whittaker to Ms Bergin dated 10 May 1996
with which was enclosed document 4 in annexure B being
the bulky document
namely, the statutory declaration of the plaintiff dated 8 May 1996 to which
there were voluminous annexures including
all the statutory declarations the
subject matter of the evidence of Mr Flynn.  This particular letter (Exhibit 2)
and its relationship
with document 4 in BJW 1 (MFI 5) did not receive much
particular attention in cross-examination by Mr Nicholas and no doubt, for
very
good reason.  Mr Whittaker however admitted that he gave careful consideration
every time a notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> was received to whether or not a claim for
privilege should be made.  In response however to the question as to when it
was deemed
appropriate to make the claim a claim was made, Mr Whittaker replied
(T212.27-35):
<P>

	<i>"A.  As I was trying to explain to you a moment ago, reasonably early in
the Royal Commission's hearings, my recollection is that
a ruling was given by
Wood J or Commissioner Wood on the issue of legal professional privilege and
its availability.  That ruling
was quite narrow in the sense that it restricted
the availability of legal professional privilege based on his interpretation of
notices.  So we were operating in that context".</i>
<P>

124	I add that no information or evidence was put before me as to the nature of
the particular ruling given by the Royal Commissioner
in this context.
<P>

125	It was put to Mr Whittaker that to the best of his recollection documents
were made available to the Commission without the
assertion of any claim for
privilege.  His response essentially was that the documents were made available
without assertions of
legal professional privilege but that never was it within
his contemplation that these documents would find themselves in the hands
of
parties other than the Royal Commission.
<P>

126	In respect of documents on "<i>compulsion</i>" Mr Whittaker said that
documents were so produced in response to Notices under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> or <i>"in
anticipation of them</i>", though he agreed that there was no compulsion in
anticipation of a Notice.  He agreed that each of the Notices made clear that
the recipient had an opportunity of not complying if the recipient wishes to
assert, for example, a claim for privilege.
<P>

127	In relation to document 6 (referred to in paragraph 29) of the affidavit
and being a copy of an undated statement of the plaintiff
(see paragraph 73
above), Mr Whittaker agreed that he could not be sure as to the basis upon
which or the circumstances in which
that document was provided.
<P>

128	In relation to documents 10, 11 and 12 (see paragraphs 77 - 79 above) the
witness's recollection was unclear as to the circumstances
of the provision of
the documents to the Royal Commission and to the Police;  this was clarified in
cross-examination in the sense
that Mr Whittaker made it clear that he was
speaking of ignorance of how documents came into the possession of the Police
and thus
were produced to the Court.
<P>

129	As to document 17 (in annexure E), statutory declarations of P28, P29 and
an undated statement of the plaintiff (see paragraph
93 above), and annexure G
being a letter to Detective Inkster of 28 March 1995, Mr Whittaker believed the
material was provided pursuant
to a request and handed over at a meeting.  The
cross-examination of Mr Whittaker concluded with his agreement to the
proposition
that material was provided to the Task Force with a view to putting
an end to the inquiry as soon as possible and that Mr Whittaker
and Mr McKeogh
caused to be prepared for Mr Marsden the material to be produced at the meeting
for the consideration of the Task
Force.
<P>

130	I turn now to the evidence of <b>Michael Bryan Joshua Lee</b>, a Partner of
Corrs.  In his first affidavit sworn 1 March 1999 Mr Lee deposes to receiving
instructions to act on behalf of the
plaintiff on or about 23 September 1998 in
relation to the investigation of the plaintiff by "<i>Strike Force Cori</i>" of
the New South Wales Police Service.  
<P>

131	On 20 November 1998 Mr Lee had a telephone conversation with Detective
Superintendent Woodhouse, the leader of that Strike Force,
during the course of
which Mr Lee indicated that he would like to arrange a meeting at his office.
He indicated that at that meeting
he proposed to give Detective Superintendent
Woodhouse certain material stating "<i>I trust that like any other material I
provide to you during the course of your investigation you will keep it
strictly confidential"</i> to which Mr Woodhouse replied, "<i>any material that
I receive from you during the course of my investigation will be kept
confidential - you don't need to worry about
that</i>".
<P>

132	A meeting took place at Mr Lee's office at 9.30am on 26 November during the
course of which Mr Lee provided to Mr Woodhouse
a document.  Annexure A to Mr
Lee's affidavit is in identical terms to annexure B to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit.   The document referred
to is document 1, being "<i>copy of
statutory declaration of John Marsden dated 25 November 1998 with attachments
consisting of other documents</i>".  The document was made by the plaintiff to
be provided with professional legal services relating to anticipated criminal
proceedings
against him, so deposes Mr Lee.  
<P>

133	Late in 1998 Mr Lee caused his secretary to provide copies of statutory
declarations to Mr Woodhouse.  Those documents are set
out in annexure B to Mr
Lee's affidavit which is in the same form as annexure E to Mr Whittaker's
affidavit.  Those documents were
number 13, described as "<i>part of a
statutory declaration of P16 dated 10 December 1998";  </i>document 41<i>
</i>described as <i>"statutory declaration of D16 dated 29 July 1996</i>" and
documents 42, 43 and 44 being statutory declarations of P16 dated 28 September
1998, 27 October 1998 and 10 December 1998. 
Mr Lee deposes to those documents
being provided on a "<i>confidential basis</i>" after conversations with Mr
Woodhouse in which he had said words to the effect <i>"I will keep these
statements confidential for the purpose of my inquiries"</i>.  The document
would not have been provided on any other basis according to Mr Lee.
<P>

134	Mr Lee's second affidavit was sworn on 2 March 1999 and relates to what I
have described earlier as the 29 January 1999 meeting.
<P>

135	Mr Lee was present at the meeting in his capacity as solicitor acting for
Mr Marsden in relation to the ongoing investigation
of Mr Marsden by "<i>Strike
Force Cori</i>".  Mr Lee deposes that prior to the meeting he had formed the
view that it was likely that a transcript of the meeting would be prepared
by a
member of the Police Service and that such a transcript might be used in
anticipated criminal proceedings against his client.
 In order to provide legal
advice to Mr Marsden in relation to anticipated criminal proceedings, Mr Lee
says he caused a tape recording
to be made of the meeting using equipment owned
by himself in order that he might have his own transcription of the meeting.
There
is exhibited (confidentiality), to Mr Lee's affidavit three original tape
cassettes (MBJL 1);  a copy of a partial transcription
prepared by his
secretary (MBJL 2);  the transcription is "<i>partial</i>" by reason of parts
of the final tape being non-transcribable because of mechanical difficulties.
The third exhibit is MBJL 3 which
is constituted by copies of original
handwritten notes made by Mr Lee during the meeting.
<P>

136	The meeting was arranged at the request of Detective Superintendent
Woodhouse in order for that officer to raise various matters
with the plaintiff
connected with the ongoing criminal investigation of Mr Marsden.  
<P>

137	In paragraph 11 of this second affidavit Mr Lee deposes to instructions
from the plaintiff that had Mr Marsden believed that
the defendant in these
proceedings would have had access to the material in MBJL 1 and MBJL 2 at a
time prior to the conclusion of
the ongoing police investigation of the
plaintiff he would not have cooperated with the Police and would not have
attended the meeting.
 Mr Lee was informed by Detective Woodhouse and believed
that Detective Woodhouse himself believed that it was important for his
ongoing
investigation that the plaintiff be interviewed.
<P>

138	I turn now to the oral evidence of Mr Lee (who was the first deponent to be
cross-examined).
<P>

139	Mr Lee gave evidence of contacts between himself and Mr Woodhouse prior to
the meeting that took place on 26 November 1998.
 To some extent, as I
understand it, Mr Lee was constrained by questions of privilege in relation to
those communications.  However,
he went about the process of gathering together
the materials for that meeting and was instructed by Mr Marsden to make the
material
available to that officer.  He denied that it was his understanding
that the Superintendent would make the material available to
his colleagues in
the Strike Force.  When he was asked what his understanding was, Mr Lee said
(T163.21 - 45):
<P>

	<i>"A. I had understood that Det Superintendent Woodhouse was the person who
was investigating the allegations raised against the plaintiff
in these
proceedings.  I believed that the matter was sufficiently sensitive for Det
Superintendent Woodhouse to retain personal
control over those documents and I
don't think I would have thought that Superintendent Woodhouse would have been
sharing the information
with others.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. You did not expect him just to sit on it himself, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. I anticipated he would review it himself, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. In relation to his reviewing it, what was your anticipation as to the
use to which he might put it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. Well, I anticipated that Det Superintendent Woodhouse on the material I
provided to him would possibly wish to interview additional
witnesses and would
have gone through the analytical process by which he would analyse the material
hitherto in relation to whether
it stacked up in light of the material which
contradicted the material he had previously gathered".</i>
<P>

140	He understood that the investigation would involve making inquiries of a
variety of people but over a relatively small number
and a relatively
"<i>confined universal facts</i>". He believed that Mr Woodhouse would
undertake the task himself.  Mr Lee could not say whether, at the time of
providing the material,
he went through the mental process of anticipating that
Mr Woodhouse at his selection might put some of his materials to various
individuals.  He acknowledged the logic of the proposition at the time of
giving evidence but said he was not sure he had formed
a view about that one
way or the other at the time.
<P>

141	He was asked (T165.23 - 35):
<P>

	<i>"Q. Can you tell us to the extent you did turn your mind to it what use you
considered he was likely to make of it?</i>
<P>

	<i>A. I thought he would use it as a basis upon which he would pursue further
lines of inquiry.  I also thought it would be a basis upon
which he would look
at the material in the statement he presumably received from the witnesses, or
the relevant witnesses and critically
analyse that material in light of the
material I was providing to him with a view, in my submission, to forming the
view that the
material which had been gathered was unreliable".</i>
<P>

142	It was agreed by Mr Lee that the material was provided to the
Superintendent with the expectation that he, having used it, would
ultimately
close down his investigation.  Mr Lee did not agree that some of the material
was the subject of a request from the Superintendent
and identified document 41
in annexure B to his affidavit, a statutory declaration of D16 dated 29 July
1996 as an item specifically
requested.
<P>

143	In relation to any conversation of discussion with the Superintendent at
the time he handed over the material Mr Lee said that
he did not have a
discussion as to what Woodhouse was to do with it.  He gave the following
evidence as to the discussion (T168.10
- 169.11):
<P>

	<i>"A. I believe I would have said to Superintendent Woodhouse words to the
following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	"This is an affidavit.  This is a statutory declaration by John Marsden
which annexes a large amount of material.  I think it is
extremely important
you read this very carefully.  I think after analysing this material you should
have real doubts whether you
should be pursuing an investigation in respect of
events and allegations."</i>
<P>

<i>	I would have said words to the effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	"I believe on the basis of the material I have seen and all the
contemporaneous records I have seen that (--) story" - </i>
<P>

<i>	I beg your pardon, the witness' story did not stack up, sorry, and I would
have entreated him probably relatively forcefully to consider
the material very
carefully.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. What do you recall his response to that exhortation being?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. I believe he would have said words to the effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	"Yes, of course I will consider it very carefully.  My desire is to conduct
a fair and impartial and balanced investigation."</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. Did that not indicate to you that in order to achieve the continuation
of the investigation there was a real likelihood that after
consideration he
would be putting to the various people the matters raised for consideration in
your client's information?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. No, I don't believe I did have that expectation at that time, no.  I
expected him to conduct or undertake an analytical task looking
at the material
I had provided to him, comparing and contrasting it with the other material and
forming a view as to its reliability.
 In doing so it may have been necessary
for him to make further inquiries, but I anticipated those to be inquiries of
other witnesses,
following up leads which would be obvious to him from the
material I had provided to him.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. As part of that follow up process it would involve the likelihood of
him, first of all, discussing matters raised in the information
that you
provided with those people?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. You simply did not turn your mind to that prospect, would that be a fair
way of putting it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. To be clear about it, it did not occur to you one way or the other that
the investigations that Superintendent Woodhouse might
thereafter carry out
would involve putting to individuals part of the material that you had
provided.  That simply did not occur
to you, that prospect?</i>
<P>

<i>	A. I didn't have the expectation he would do that. I didn't have the
expectation he would do that".</i>
<P>

144	The assurance Mr Lee said he understood Mr Woodhouse to be giving was that
his investigations would be confidential, unobtrusive
and discrete.  He did not
agree that the material was provided to the Superintendent for use by him
"<i>as he saw fit</i>".
<P>

145	In relation to document 1 in annexure A to Mr Lee's affidavit being the
copy of statutory declaration of the plaintiff dated
25 November 1998 (the day
before the meeting) with attachments consisting of other documents, Mr Lee
played a part in the preparation
of the statutory declaration but not the
attachments.  The attachments were provided to him by his client Mr Marsden.
The other documents
provided, as I understand his evidence, was provided by the
plaintiff.
<P>

146	Mr Lee was cross-examined in relation to annexures B and C to the affidavit
sworn 2 March 1999 of Superintendent Woodhouse.
 Those annexures constitute a
letter from the Superintendent to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's reply
thereto.  The subject matter,
very briefly stated, concerns D15 and D16.  The
communications were referred to Mr Lee and Mr Lee said that eventually his
instructions
were to provide the material to Detective Superintendent
Woodhouse.  He had only recently been instructed however, and then wished
not
to provide that material until he had the opportunity of becoming fully
apprised of the matter.  He had a number of conversations
with the plaintiff
leading up to the following month as to whether or not the material should be
provided.  He agreed that the exercise
of whether or not the material should be
provided was a carefully considered one and said that the purpose of the
provision of the
material was to provide Detective Superintendent Woodhouse
with material for the purposes of his investigation.
<P>

147	As to Mr Lee informing Phillips Fox of the existence of the statutory
declarations and other documents, Mr Lee believed that
he would have had a
conversation with Mr Potter (the solicitor on the record in the defamation
actions), at some stage, indicating
to him that he had provided material to
Woodhouse.  He did not believe that he particularised that material.  His
conversations with
Mr Potter would have been relatively general.
<P>

148	In his affidavit parts of which were read for the defendant, <b>Mr
Woodhouse</b> deposes that at the beginning of the interview with Mr Marsden on
29 January 1999 Mr Lee said words to the effect "<i>My client does not want a
copy of the tape or transcript of the interview at this time because be may be
obliged to discover them
to Channel 7"</i>.  It was put to Mr Lee that this was
the essence or substance of the conversation.  Mr Lee whilst not denying the
use of the words
to that effect gave evidence as to the following context
(T181.10):
<P>

	<i>"A.  I said to Detective Inspector Woodhouse: "You will note that when you
go into the room there will be recording material I have
placed there. I
propose to record the meeting to keep a record of what was said in order that I
may be able to formulate a response
to the matters you put to Mr Marsden. I
don't want a copy of the ERISP tape at the conclusion of the meeting because I
don't want
there to be an argument about whether or not that material is
required to be provided in the existing defamation proceedings that
are taking
place." I think Detective Inspector Woodhouse said: "That's fine. </i>
<P>

	<i>Q.  And as part of that conversation, it would be fair to say wouldn't it
that you made the statement that I have already put to you,
namely: "My client
does not want a copy of the tape or transcript of the interview at this time
because he may be obliged to discover
them to Channel 7"?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.  I certainly believe I said the first part of that. I think I actually
have a recollection of using the word ERISP tapes and I
believe I said I don't
want there to be an argument about whether or not that material is required to
be provided in the existing
civil litigation or defamation proceedings or words
to that effect, that is why I tried to describe it as a reduction of what I
said.
It was part of what I said.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.  Because your concern was if you did take possession of the tape or
transcript of this interview from the police you might be obliged
to discover
it in the defamation proceedings wasn't it?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.  It wasn't a matter for me, it was a matter for other solicitors, but I
took the view if I made a transcript it would be subjected
to client legal
privilege but if a transcript was received by the police I really hadn't turned
my mind to the fact whether or not
that would be privileged but I thought it
would be better to avoid an argument if at all possible.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.  And to avoid the risk?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.  Yes".</i>
<P>

149	Finally, agreed that he did not inform the solicitors for the plaintiff in
the defamation actions (Mr Potter of Phillips Fox),
of the existence of Mr
Lee's records of the meeting of 29 January 1999 until he swore his affidavit of
2 March 1999.
<P>

150	As I have indicated<b> Superintendent Woodhouse</b> swore an affidavit on 2
March 1999, parts of which were read by the defendant as evidence in the
plaintiff's Motion.  The deponent
is a Detective Superintendent of Police and
is Commander of Strike Force Cori, a Task Force established in December 1997 to
investigate
the claims made by the Honourable Franca Arena MP.  During the
course of the investigations conducted by that Strike Force, the deponent
has
investigated allegations made against the plaintiff.  In particular he carried
out investigations into allegations made two brothers
D15 and D16 (their names
are set out in para graph 5 of the affidavit).  
<P>

151	In September 1998 Superintendent Woodhouse wrote to Mr Marsden in relation
to these allegations and the correspondence already
referred to above
(paragraph 146 are annexed to the affidavit and marked "<i>B"</i> and
"<i>C"</i>.  On 22 December 1998, the Superintendent wrote to Mr Lee seeking an
appointment with Mr Marsden to conduct with him during which
he intended to put
to him the contents of allegations investigated by the Strike Force during
1998.  There was some delay in interviewing
Mr Marsden by reason of Mr Lee's
absence on leave and an appointment was eventually made for 29 January.
<P>

152	On 29 January the Superintendent interviewed Mr Marsden and put to him
allegations arising from the investigation carried out
by the Strike Force in
1998.  Present at the meeting were Mr Lee and Detective Senior Constable
Cunningham.  The interview commenced
at 9.30am and concluded at 12.10pm and was
recorded.  At the beginning of the interview with Mr Marsden, Mr Lee said to
the deponent
words to the effect:  "<i>My client does not want a copy of the
tape or transcript of the interview at this time because he may be obliged to
discover them
to Channel 7"</i>.
<P>

153	According to Mr Woodhouse none of the documents supplied to him and
referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Mr Lee's affidavit
were solicited by
him.  That material, I note, includes document 41 being a statutory declaration
of D16 dated 29 July 1996 (document
41).  On the evidence of Mr Lee and taking
into account that Mr Woodhouse was not cross-examined, I think at best Mr
Woodhouse is
mistaken in this regard.  In exhibit B to his affidavit, being the
letter Mr Woodhouse wrote to Mr Marsden, Mr Woodhouse states "<i>I am also
aware that you are in possession of statutory declarations made by ... D16 ...
which you may wish to forward to me at this
stage. ... D16 ... is agreeable to
this course of action"</i>.  I am of the view that that statement in exhibit B
fairly can be regarded as a request.
<P>

154	Mr Woodhouse goes on to depose that he has no recollection of a
conversation of 20 November 1998 (see paragraph 131 above),
however his
understanding at all times when he received material from Mr Marsden's
solicitors was that the material was to be used
"<i>exclusively for the purpose
of considering it in the context of other material I had received in the course
of the investigations
of Strike Force Cori"</i>.
<P>

	<b>Submissions </b>
<P>

155	In the context of applying <b><i>Akins</i></b> and, for the moment, not
discriminating as to the date for the creation of any relevant document or
event, it is submitted for the
plaintiff that the evidence before me discloses
that the material over which privilege is claimed falls within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 118</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> being <i>"advice</i>" privilege.  That is, documents are
not to be inspected if, on the objection by a client, the Court finds that the
inspection of
the documents would result in the disclosure of a confidential
communication made between the client and a lawyer or the contents
of a
confidential document (whether delivered or not) prepared by the client or a
lawyer for the "<i>sole</i>" purpose of the lawyer or one or more of the
lawyers providing legal advice to the client.  (Mr McHugh "<i>opened</i>" his
case on this issue on a "<i>sole</i>" purpose basis, as I have indicated.)  The
material also would fall within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 119</a> (<i>"litigation</i>" privilege) at the
time it was created.  That is, documents are not to be inspected if, on
objection by the client, the Court finds
that the inspection of documents would
result in disclosure of a confidential communication between the client and
another person
or between a lawyer acting for the client and another person
that was made or, the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered
or
not) that was prepared for the "<i>sole</i>" purpose of the client being
provided with professional legal services relating to anticipated or pending
proceedings in which the
client is or may be or was or might have been a party.
Insofar as the documents consist of copies of documents which were made for
privileged purposes the "<b><i>Propend</i></b>" principle would apply.
<P>

156	The privileged purposes were constituted by (a) use by the plaintiff's
lawyers as evidence in current or anticipated civil proceedings
and anticipated
criminal proceedings;  (b) use by the plaintiff's lawyers in providing him with
advice in respect of such proceedings;
 and, (c) for use by the plaintiff's
lawyers in dissuading the investigating and prosecuting authorities from
commencing the anticipated
criminal proceedings.
<P>

157	The real issue is whether, when the document found to have been privileged,
the privilege has been lost by reason of the disclosure
of the material to the
Royal Commission or to the Police.  The only relevant provision of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)</a> which would not operate to defeat the claim for
privilege because in respect of each document or communication the disclosure
was
made, as I understand the submissions, in the end, (a) "<i>under compulsion
of law</i>" pursuant to Notices issued pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal
Commission (Police Service) Act 1994</a></i> (<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(c))</a>, or
(b) in the course of making a confidential communication in the sense that the
person to whom it was made was under an express
or implied obligation not to
disclose its contents (<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117(1)</a>;  <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal
Commission (Police Service) Act 1994</a></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 28</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">30</a>).  
<P>

158	Further, in any event, even if the common law test were applied to the
question of whether documents produced on subpoena or
Notice to Produce are
privileged from inspection, there could be no "<i>unfairness</i>' to the
defendant in denying it inspection.  The only disclosures were made to the
Royal Commission or to the Police were disclosures
made for the purpose to
which I have referred namely, dissuading the authorities from commencing
anticipated criminal proceedings
and the plaintiff's giving of assistance in
that context.  The evidence and submissions for the defendant do not disclose
any particular
unfairness to it from the plaintiff's conduct.  The defendant's
position really boils to nothing more than the conduct might be characterised
as preventing the "<i>truth</i>" from coming out and that is <i>"unfair</i>".
I would take it that that would be argued to conform with and not contravene
the general statement of principle by Gleeson CJ in
<b><i>Benecke</i></b>
<i>(supra).</i>
<P>

159	Indeed it is argued that if privilege attaches to the material provided to
the Police and which therefore provides the source
of some material used by the
Police in relation to others concerned in the investigation the
"<i>unfairness</i>" to the plaintiff would be obvious, the defendant, in
effect, if inspection is allowed, being given proofs of the plaintiff's
witnesses
on the issues of truth in order to put to its own witnesses on that
subject before the trial begins (see, for example, document 37
in BJW 4.  This
was not a document from the plaintiff.  It is a police document from which has
been excised material founded in privileged
material provided to the Police by
the plaintiff).
<P>

160	A subsidiary argument advanced by Mr McHugh is that the material provided
to the Royal Commission and the Police would be protected
by a notion akin to
public interest immunity.  Inspection should be declined because the very
criterion by which it has been identified,
that is, the material, is the fact
that it was provided to the Royal Commission or to the Police.  The "<i>public
interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the ...
documents</i>" outweighs the defendant's private interest in inspecting them (s
130(1) <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>).  To grant inspection of such material would defeat
what is said to be the important public interest recognised by the criminal
sanctions provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27(1)(b)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 30(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission
(Police Service) Act 1994</a> </i>in the confidentiality of material provided to
the Royal Commission.  This is particularly so where and when the material was
brought
into existence under compulsion of law for the sole purpose of a
complying with a Notice under that Act.  None of the material could
have
subpoenaed from the Royal Commission itself <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 30(3)).</a>  Finally, disclosure of
the material would be inherently likely to prejudice Police inquiries which are
continuing (that is clear
on the evidence both of Mr Lee and Mr Woodhouse:  see
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 130(4)(c)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> and <b><i>Attorney-General (NSW) v
Stuart</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20667" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 667</a> at 680 - 681).
<P>

161	For the defendant in response to this last mentioned component of the
plaintiff's position (the asserted <i>"public interest immunity</i>") it was
submitted that there is no foundation for the application of any such doctrine
(I take it outside of its usually accepted
areas of application), to the
circumstances of this case.  By itself an assertion of some "<i>public interest
immunity</i>" would not envelope and protect the disclosure of the confidential
exhibits to Mr Lee's second affidavit, being his record of the
interview of 29
January 1999.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission (Police Service) Act
1994</a></i> is limited by its terms to the staff of the Commission.  It is not
relevant because we are not concerned with any conduct of an individual
or
person associated with the Commission but with whether or not the plaintiff can
maintain this notion of immunity having divulged
to the Commission the
information and material.  In any event, it is submitted, that
<i>"confidentiality</i>" does not found immunity of the kind advanced by the
plaintiff:  <b><i>D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) AC 171</a> at 231D.  Nothing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a> of the Royal
Commission legislation (disclosures prejudicing inquiry), supports in any
independent way the existence of any such
asserted immunity.  Indeed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a>, it
is argued, provides mechanisms which if followed preclude contravention of that
section.  
<P>

162	The plaintiff in reply to the defendant's position emphasises reliance upon
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 130</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission (Police Service)
Act</a></i>.  The clear provision of the latter is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 30</a> dealing with secrecy of
material provided to the Commission.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 28(1)</a> is a supplement which deals
with <i>"information about the Notice or Summons</i>", not about the
information provided pursuant to any such Notice or Summons.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 28(1)</a>
provides that information about such Notices is not to be disclosed even by the
person to whom Notices are issued and the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(3)</a> are exceptions
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(1)</a> without which a person would not able to obtain legal advice about
the Notice itself <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 28(3)(c)).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 130</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>
requires the Court to balance the public interest in the disclosure of
documents in the present proceedings with the public interest
in the secrecy
and integrity of the Royal Commission and Police investigations.  It is
submitted that there is no reason to think
that the disclosure of these
documents in this civil litigation is of sufficient importance to undermine
that component of the public
interest.  
<P>

163	In the light of the ultimate conclusions to which I have come as to the
disposition of the Motion in the context of the applications
of the principles
relating to privilege and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> in that regard, there is no
necessity for me to decide between the attractive arguments advanced on each
side.  In the context of
this civil litigation (being an action for defamation
in which the defendant is seeking to prove to be true the defamatory
imputations
it has been found to have published of the plaintiff),
particularly, I would be inclined seriously to consider the propositions
advanced
by Mr McHugh.  
<P>

164	The basic position taken by the defendant is, whether or not the common law
applies or the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i>applies in relation these ancillary
processes, taking up the proposition of <i>"dedication to the stipulated
purpose</i>" (<b><i>Grant v Downs</i></b> at 689 <i>(supra))</i>, that the true
purpose clearly was to present this information to the Police and where
relevant to the Royal Commission to <i>"advance the plaintiff's interests</i>".
The information was assembled to put the plaintiff's case to another entity and
documents used for that purpose are not protected
in the way presently claimed.
Much reliance in this regard is placed upon the actual evidence given by Mr Lee
in support of this
proposition restated to the effect that the dominant
purpose, the true purpose for disclosure was to advance and enhance the
plaintiff's
submissions as to why the inquiry by the Police into his affairs or
by the Royal Commission should be brought to end.  Such a purpose
is not one
that would be embraced by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> nor would be recognised at
common law.
<P>

165	The submission is also advanced in terms that whilst what took place,
as-it-were, in the office as between the client or the
witness and the
solicitor might be protected, once that office door was opened and the material
was used in the way it was here by
delivery to the Royal Commission or the
Police, the reality is that the conclusion had been reached that it would be a
useful thing,
a beneficial thing to the plaintiff, that the material be
provided to the Police for the purposes of their investigations and ultimately
to the end that the inquiry would be terminated because innocence has been
satisfactorily established without prosecution and trial.
<P>

166	That this was the true purpose was exemplified by the document to which I
have referred being a statement produced by the Police
upon an interview with
D16 being document 37 in BJW 4 from which parts have been excised.  This points
to the Police, it is said,
putting to D16 material from the statutory
declaration provided by the plaintiff.  Relying upon this and similar examples,
it is
argued for the defendant that even if the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> applies, by
the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(4)</a>, because the substance of the evidence/document has
been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client., privilege
is
lost.  It is argued in relation to these edited documents that their existence
demonstrates very clearly what happened, that is,
there was put to the relevant
person, namely D16, components of what had been put to the Police, that was
what was likely to happen,
that it was known that that was likely to happen and
thus there was the necessary express or implied consent. For the purposes of
this submission, it is argued, that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(a)</a> is directed to the occasion of
the creation of the communication or document.  That brings one back, it is
argued, to the discussion
in the office between the client and the solicitor.
That exercise of disclosure is the one that is protected.  That is to be
distinguished
from what is described as the next step, the material having been
prepared, it is then handed over in what is said to be a "<i>confidential</i>"
situation.  At this point I am not persuaded by this submission as to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
122(2)(a).</a>  The confidentiality requirement is established in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 119</a>;  on the
defendant's construction <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(a)</a> would be redundant.  Privilege is

of the relevant document.  (cf. <b><i> Telstra v Australis Media Holdings (No.

<P>

167	With respect to the communication of material to the Royal Commission, the
position of the defendant is essentially that either
the material was provided
voluntarily in the absence of any Notices under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> or in the absence of
any objection being taken or privilege being claimed, documents produced
pursuant to the service of such Notice
were not produced under compulsion of
law.  In relation to material the subject of Notices under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> the
evidence is clear that in respect of one communication only namely, Exhibit 3,
was objection taken.  No other allowable claim
for privilege was made.  The
further category to which I will come below is the material that accompanied
Exhibit 2.
<P>

168	In addition to the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(a)</a> advanced for the plaintiff
in reply, it was submitted that I would reject the defendant's invitation to
find or to infer that the
<i>"true</i>" or <i>"dedicated</i>" or even the
"<i>dominant</i>" purpose of all the documents over which the plaintiff claims
privilege was to give them to the Police and/or the Royal Commission
for the
purpose asserted by the defendant.  A <b><i>Browne v Dunn</i></b> point was
sought to be taken by Mr McHugh in relation to the sweeping nature of the
proposition advanced for the defendant in its
not having been put to any of the
plaintiff's witnesses.  I am not persuaded that such a submission fairly can be
made.  The cross-examination
of the plaintiff's witnesses, particularly Messrs
Lee and Whittaker, was clear, to my mind, in its import and direction in this
regard.
<P>

169	It was submitted that there no evidence to support the submission about the
purpose in such general terms.  The documents over
which privilege was claimed
fall into clear categories:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Lee's notes of the meeting of 29 January 1999.  These documents have
been created but never disclosed to any third party;
 the meeting of 29 January
1999 cannot be described as the defendant describes it as "<i>not being a
protected occasion</i>" as this misconceives the nature of the claim which
concerns the documents created by Mr Lee rather than the information imparted
by the plaintiff and Mr Lee at the meeting.
<P>

	(b)	Original witness statements of third parties which were copied and
attached to statutory declarations of the plaintiff:  these
are submitted to be
classic privilege documents.  There is no evidence to suggest that their
"<i>true</i>" purpose was anything else at the time at which they were made.
The retainer of Corrs in respect of the Police investigation came
after its
retainer in respect of the anticipated broadcast of <i>"Today Tonight</i>"
(see, for example, paragraphs 7 and 12 of Mr Whittaker's affidavit).  Mr Lee's
evidence concerned the "<i>use</i>" to which the Police would put the material
provided by Mr Lee, not the circumstances or the purpose of the creation of
that material.
<P>

	(c)	Statutory declarations of the plaintiff brought into existence to answer <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
6</a> Notices or letters or requests from the Royal Commission:  these are
identified as documents numbered 2 in BJW 1, 19 in BJW 4;  3
in BJW 1;  6 in
BJW 1 and 18 in BJW 4.  Certainly these are documents in respect of which
evidence is capable of pointing to the
defendant's submission as to a
"<i>dedicated</i>" purpose.  However, it is the plaintiff's case that the
purpose was one arising out of the professional legal services which Corrs
were
providing to the plaintiff in respect of the Royal Commission.
<P>

	(d)	The Records of Interview (that is, Police documents) which refer to the
above documents:  the claim for privilege stands or
falls on the claim in
respect of the primary material to which the Police documents refer.
<P>

170	Where documents are created for the purpose of use by a client's legal
advisers to persuade an investigating or prosecuting
authority not to bring
anticipated criminal proceedings, that purpose clearly constitutes the
provision of "<i>professional legal services</i>" within the ordinary of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 119</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  It is a traditional form of professional legal
representation and there could be no question, it is argued, that such
documents
were privileged at the time of their creation before they were
provided to the Police.  The only question is whether or not the documents
retain that quality of confidentiality after they were so provided, which is a
question of waiver and not of purpose.  Additionally,
where the documents which
were copied and attached to the statutory declarations of the plaintiff
provided to the Police were originally
privileged, the purpose for which they
were copied is irrelevant:  those documents remain privileged until privilege
is lost by operation
of those sections of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> which govern
the loss of privilege.  In relation to the use of documents for the Police
investigation the question is whether or
not the material was confidential at
the time it was provided to the Police or to the Royal Commission.  What those
bodies did later
does not destroy the confidential character of the
communication of that material.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 122(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>
deals with the consequences flowing from disclosures made by Mr Woodhouse to
third parties.  As I have said, if those disclosures
were made with the express
or implied consent of the plaintiff, then privilege is lost.  
<P>

171	I was assisted by the preparation of three schedules prepared by the
parties for the purposes of submissions.  The schedule
of material produced by
the Police over which the plaintiff claims privilege is MFI 32 and kept with
the Court file;  the schedule
of material produced to the Court by the
plaintiff over which privilege is claimed is MFI 33, these two schedules were
provided by
counsel for the plaintiff;  the document entitled
"<i>Reconciliation of Marsden Material Whittaker Annexure B Documents Produced
by Plaintiff;  Whittaker Annexure E Documents Produced
by the Police"</i> is
marked MFI 34;  this document was provided by Mr Nicholas Q.C. for the
defendant.
<P>

	<b>Conclusions and Orders</b>
<P>

172	With respect to confidential exhibits MBJL 1 - 3 to Mr Lee's affidavit of 2
March 1999 relating to the meeting of 29 January
1999, I have no difficulty at
all in coming the conclusion that those three items were created by Mr Lee both
for the provision of
legal advice to his client consequent upon the events
recorded and relating to anticipated criminal proceedings in the clear context
of continuing Police investigation.  In this regard, the plaintiff will be
entitled to the benefit of Order 1(f).
<P>

173	With respect to confidential exhibits WF 1 - 14 to the affidavit of Mr
Flynn sworn on 2 March 1999, in relation to those documents
created before 1
September 1995 I hold them to be clearly documents brought into existence as
witness statements in anticipation
of civil proceedings as one purpose and
criminal proceedings then anticipated as another.  Either purpose can be
described as <i>"sole</i>" or indeed, <i>"dominant</i>".  Any conclusion to
which Mr Flynn came that the criminal proceedings would not be proceeding as a
result of information provided
to him by a source independent of the plaintiff
is irrelevant.  The subsequent disposition of this material, privileged at its
creation,
will be considered later.
<P>

174	With respect to confidential exhibit MBJL 1 to the affidavit of Mr Lee
sworn 1 March 1999, in the light of all the findings,
it will remain
confidential save as to the identity of P1 and P14.
<P>

175	With respect to materials provided to the Royal Commission:  the first
observation I make (and it is perhaps inconsequential)
is to query any Notice
issued to Mr Marsden under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission (Police Service)
Act</a></i>.  The section appears to be directed to public authorities or public
officials.  With respect to material produced pursuant to a
Notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a>, I
am of the view that all such material is produced under compulsion of law
unless pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8(2)</a> the Commissioner sets aside the requirement of the
Notice.  I do not read <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 7</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a> of that Act as derogating from the requirement
of compliance merely by the taking of objection (as evidenced in this
application
by Exhibit 1), or by the making of a claim for privilege.  The
compulsion arises upon the service of the Notice;  the terms of compliance
might be affected by the setting aside of the requirement or the upholding of a
claim for privilege but until such events occur the
compulsion persists.  That
is a compulsion of law provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(b)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.</i>
It is a compulsion that precludes the disclosures referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a> of the
Act, the only disclosures being relevant in the present application is that
provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(1)(b)</a> which permits a person without penalty to disclose
information about the Notice or Summons for the purpose of obtaining legal
advice
in relation to the Notice or Summons.  (In my view, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(3)(c)</a> permits
disclosure for the very purpose of the determination in legal proceedings of
the Notice of Motion with which I am concerned.)
<P>

176	Communications with the Royal Commission otherwise than pursuant to Notice
or Summons and thus under compulsion of law, of material
which is otherwise
privileged is protected as a confidential communication under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)(a)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>. </i> The operation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/" class="autolink_findacts">Royal Commission (Police
Service) Act</a></i> particularly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 28</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rcsa1994334/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">30</a> provide the
foundation for the existence of such circumstances:  the recipient (the Royal
Commission) obtained the information under
an obligation not to disclose its
contents for the purposes of the definition of confidential communication in s
117 and thus, the
operation of s 122(2)(a).
<P>

177	With respect to all documents save for what I will describe as "<i>Police
generated</i>" documents I have come to the conclusion that at the time of
their creation, whether they are statements of the plaintiff or of other
witnesses, they were created in circumstances to which privilege applies either
under the common law or the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  
<P>

178	The communication of this privileged material by the plaintiff or his
lawyers to the Royal Commission does not deprive that
material of its quality
of being privileged by reason of no objection being taken or no claim for
privilege being made.  Such material
is protected as privileged material and as
a confidential communication.
<P>

179	There is one body of material however, that does cause me some concern.
That is document 4 in BJW 1 which was delivered to the
Royal Commission under
cover of the letter which is now Exhibit 2, the relevant terms of that letter
with are set out in paragraph
70 above a statutory declaration dated 8 May
1996.  This is an extraordinarily curious document in itself: presumably the
Royal Commission
would not have been troubled to go about discriminating
between communications with respect to which Corrs said privilege is not
waived
and annexures in respect of which it says legal professional privilege was
waived.  On one view, the letter is almost incomprehensible
viewed by itself
and viewed with document 4 of BJW 1. Mr Whittaker's evidence is referred to in
paragraph 71 above. 
<P>

180	The only conclusion to which I can come is that first, the material was
provided generally on a confidential basis and second,
in that context as
between the persons who provided the material in respect of which privilege was
waived, it was waived to the Commission
as between the Commission and those
people.  As I have remarked above, I was not provided with the text of any
ruling Wood J gave
as Commissioner in relation to claims for privilege.  In the
end the conclusion to which I come, but candidly with some reservation
based
upon, at the very least, the peculiar wording of the letter to the Royal
Commission, is that the whole of the communication
being document 4 in BJW 1
was a confidential communication. 
<P>

181	Bearing in mind that I have found that the material hitherto referred to
was privileged at the time of its creation and remains
so notwithstanding
communication to the Royal Commission, I turn to the material from the Police,
namely BJW 4.  I am persuaded that
the compilation of material both by Mr
Whittaker and Mr Lee for provision to the Police as between each and the
plaintiff was the
compilation of privileged material including privileged
material constituted by "<i>witnesses statements"</i> hitherto obtained.
Equally am I persuaded that the provision of that material to the relevant
Police officers in the course of an
ongoing investigation was a confidential
communication;  that in relation to both Mr Whittaker and Mr Lee the
circumstances of their
giving the information and the position of the recipient
gave rise to the requisite confidentiality.  I am satisfied in relation
to the
November 1998 and January 1999 provision of materials that the circumstances
were such as to create an express or implied
obligation not to disclose the
contents of those materials.  The ambit of that confidentiality at one end,
as-it-were, can be identified
as not precluding the Police during the course of
their investigation using it to conclude that the plaintiff should be
prosecuted
and using the material in the course of the prosecution of the
plaintiff.  On the other hand, the position taken by both Mr Lee and
Mr
Whittaker to the effect that the material was placed before the Police with a
view to their considering it in isolation and being
thereby persuaded to shut
down the investigation favourably to the plaintiff, cannot be described as
having, on any realistic view,
been reasonably based.  Mr Woodhouse in his
affidavit (paragraph 35) in relation to his understanding stated that the
material was
to be used exclusively for the purpose of "<i>considering it</i>"
in the context of other material he had received in the course of his
investigation.  Even that understanding, on any realistic
view, could not
preclude a person in the position of Mr Woodhouse from making an inquiry of a
complainant in the light of the information
provided to him.  To put it at its
highest, it would be naive to expect an officer in the position of Mr Woodhouse
either to immediately
shutdown his investigation by reason of the provision of
the information or to take no step by way of inquiry or in pursuing the
investigation, the material having been provided.
<P>

182	Nonetheless, whilst the ambit of confidentiality would permit such a
limited course to be taken by the Police officer, such
a course would not
amount to one taken with the implied or express consent of the plaintiff to
extinguish the privilege that attaches
both to the material or the
confidentiality that otherwise exists.  This is an extremely delicate and
difficult area.  I am not persuaded
by the submission for the defendant in
relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  The documents being
privileged, the provision of them to the Police being a confidential
communication, the consent of the plaintiff
to the use by the Police officer as
I have described it, in my view, is not consent, express or implied, to the
disclosure of the
substance of the privileged material by the Police officer
which, as a matter of principle, construction of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> or in
any sense of fairness could be one as to amount to a "<i>waiver</i>" and thus
deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the privilege that attached to the
material and the confidentiality that flowed
from the occasion of its being
handed over.
<P>

183	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	Inspection of the following documents be restricted to the plaintiff and his
legal advisers:
<P>

(a)	<b>m</b>aterial produced to the Court by the New South Wales Police Service
in answer to subpoenas for production over which the plaintiff
has claimed
privilege being the material in MFI 8, being confidential exhibit BJW 4 to the
affidavit of B J Whittaker affirmed on
1 March 1999, except for document 32
therein.
<P>

(b)	<b>m</b>aterial produced to the Court by the plaintiff in answer to a
subpoena for production issued on 2 February 1999 at the request of
the
defendant being the material in MFI 5, being confidential exhibit BJW 1 to the
affidavit of B J Whittaker affirmed 1 March 1999.
<P>

(c)	Confidential exhibits BJW 1 (MFI 5), BJW 3 (MFI 7), BJW 4 (MFI 8), BJW 5
(MFI 9) save for the identity of P1 and P14 to the
affidavit of B J Whittaker
affirmed on 1 March 1999.
<P>

(d)	Confidential exhibit MBJL 1 to the affidavit of M B J Lee sworn 1 March
1999 save for the identity P1 and P14.
<P>

(e)	Confidential exhibits WF 1 - 14 (MFI 11 - 24) to the affidavit of W Flynn
affirmed on 2 March 1999.
<P>

(f)	Confidential exhibits MBJL 1 to MBJL 3 (MFI 2, 3 and 4) to the affidavit of
M B J Lee sworn 2 March 1999.
<P>

2.	The MFI's referred to in Order 1 are to be retained the confidential custody
of the Court until further order.
