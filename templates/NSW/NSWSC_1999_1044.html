<u>Tuesday 19th October 1999</u>

<b><u>NO. 50112 OF 1998</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>WAYNE LAWRENCE PTY. LIMITED  V.  HUNT &amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The defendant in these proceedings has issued a subpoena to
solicitors previously acting for the plaintiff requiring the production
of
certain documents relating to dealings between those solicitors and the
plaintiff.  I am dealing with an application by the defendant
to inspect those
documents, and a claim for legal professional privilege advanced on behalf of
the plaintiff resisting such inspection.
<P>

2  	The matter arises in this way.
<P>

3  	On 23rd April this year, Einstein, J. ordered that the plaintiff
provide security for costs of the defendant in the sum of $40,000.00
within 28
days.  That order was not complied with, and on 31st May 1999, the defendant
filed a Notice of Motion for dismissal of
the proceedings.  That Notice of
Motion was heard and determined on 11th June 1999, and after a contested
hearing, Rolfe, J. dismissed
the proceedings.  On 25th June 1999, the plaintiff
filed a Notice of Motion seeking to set aside the judgments of 23rd April 1999
and 11th June 1999; and on 29th June 1999, the plaintiff filed a holding
summons for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

4  	In support of the Notice of Motion filed 25th June 1999, there
was filed on behalf of the plaintiff an affidavit by Wayne Lawrence
dated 27th
August 1999 in which, among other things, Mr. Lawrence asserts that, until
Rolfe, J.'s decision, the plaintiff always
believed that if the security for
costs were not lodged, the hearing date would be vacated and the litigation
stayed until the security
for costs was provided.  The affidavit goes on to
assert that the plaintiff was shocked when the matter was struck out. 
<P>

5  	At the hearings before Einstein, J. and Rolfe, J., the plaintiff
was represented by Counsel, instructed by the solicitors whose
papers have been
subpoenaed.  In substance, what the defendants say is that the plaintiff by
this affidavit has put in issue a belief
of Mr. Lawrence on a matter as to
which it is reasonable to think he would have had legal advice.  The assertion
of that belief therefore
waives privilege in relation to communications with
his legal advisers, at least in so far as those communications are relevant to
that belief.
<P>

6  	The issue as I have stated it seems simple, but the application
raises many problems.
<P>

7  	The first problem is whether the law applicable to this
application is the common law as to legal professional privilege, or
the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, and in particular, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122</a> of that Act.  The documents were
apparently produced on 27th September 1999.  With effect from 1st October 1999,
the Supreme Court
Rules were amended in order to make clear that in dealing
with documents produced under subpoena, the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> were
to be applied.  The situation in relation to documents produced before that
date is not entirely clear.  
<P>

8  	There are a number of decisions, including the decision of the
NSW Court of Appeal in <u>Atkins v. Abigroup</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/254.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 254</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 539</a>, to the
effect that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> should apply in relation to ancillary process as
well as to the admissibility of evidence at a hearing.  However, that decision
was
seriously doubted and distinguished in a decision of the NSW Court of
Criminal Appeal in <u>R. v. Young</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/166.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCCA 166.</a>  I am inclined to
think that I am still bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal; but because
of the uncertainty as to the position,
I think it is appropriate for me to look
at this matter in the light of both alternatives. 
<P>

9  	Dealing first with the position under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, it would
appear that legal professional privilege would relevantly be lost only if the
adducing or production of the evidence has
the consent of the client in
question within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122(1)</a>, or if the substance of this evidence has been
knowingly and voluntarily disclosed within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122(2).</a>  
<P>

10  	If the affidavit had said that Mr. Lawrence had a certain
belief, and that this belief was in accordance with the legal advice
which he
had received, then that would amount to disclosure of the substance of the
legal advice, so that legal professional privilege
in relation to
communications concerning that matter could be lost under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122(2).</a>  However,
the affidavit does not say this, and in my opinion it does not disclose the
substance of legal advice.
<P>

11  	Alternatively, it could be suggested that by raising as a
significant matter Mr. Lawrence's belief on this question, the plaintiff
must
be deemed to have consented to the adducing of evidence relevant to the
question whether he did in fact hold this belief, and
whether any such belief
would be reasonable.  That approach has some support from the decision of the
majority of the Full Federal
Court in <u>Telstra Corporation Ltd. v. BT
Australia Pty. Ltd</u>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20156%20ALR%20634" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 156 ALR 634.</a>  In that case, the defendant
pleaded that it undertook certain action in reliance on a certain
representation; and the majority of
the Full Court held that it thereby opened
up as an element of the cause of action, an issue which could not fairly be
assessed without
examination of relevant legal advice.  The majority of the
Full Court considered that in such circumstances, the party is to be taken
as
either having consented to the use of the relevant privileged legal advice or
communications, or to have waived reliance on the
privilege which such material
would otherwise attract.  
<P>

12  	Accepting that the decision of the majority in that case
correctly interprets and applies <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122(1)</a>, it seems to me still that the
question of whether the advancing of a person's state of mind is to be taken as
consenting to the
giving of evidence of confidential communication, or as
waiving privilege, is a matter of degree in each case.  It does not seem
to me
that the assertion of a belief must, in all circumstances, be taken as
consenting to evidence being led of any legal advice
or confidential
communication that could be relevant to whether such a belief was held or the
reasonableness of such belief.  It
seems to me that factors relevant to whether
that consent is to be considered as having been given, or whether privilege is
taken
to have been waived, would include the significance of the belief to the
case as a whole; the relevance of the reasonableness of
the belief to the case
as a whole; the probability or otherwise of the legal advice being relevant to
the holding of that belief,
or being relevant to its reasonableness; and in
circumstances where the Court inspects the legal advice in question in order to
make
a decision, the extent to which the legal advice does in fact bear upon
the holding of the belief or its reasonableness, and the
extent to which the
legal advice relevant to those matters is inextricably bound up with legal
advice going to other questions as
to which there has been no consent or
waiver.  It seems to me that, on the basis of all those matters at least, the
Court has to
make a judgment as to what is reasonable, and what is fair in the
particular case.
<P>

13  	In the present case, it seems to me that the belief alleged does
not loom as a centrally important part of the plaintiff's
case, particularly
where there is no allegation that the belief was reasonable, or that it had any
particular basis.  As things stand,
it is simply an allegation of a belief,
unsupported by any positive suggestion that it was held reasonably, or any
indication of
the basis on which it was held.
<P>

14  	Having regard to those matters, and having looked quickly at the
material itself, I am not satisfied, as the matter stands
at present, that the
plaintiff should be considered as having given consent to the adducing or
production of this evidence, or waived
privilege, so as to come within the
terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122(1).</a>  The situation may become different if the plaintiff
voluntarily comes to advance any suggestion that the belief was reasonably
held,
or held on the basis of advice or lack of advice from his legal advisers,
or based on any particular ground which in turn has some
implication about
advice or lack of advice.  If those suggestions come through a responsive
answer to cross-examination, it would
be, I think, a matter for the judge
hearing the case to decide whether that really amounts to the plaintiff
voluntarily putting forward
a positive case of that kind, or merely giving an
answer which was, in substance, required by the question, and thus initiated by
the defendant.
<P>

15  	It appears to be the law that where legal professional privilege
or other privilege is claimed, that of itself cannot be the
basis of an adverse
inference being drawn against the party claiming that privilege.  However, in
my opinion, where a party is claiming
to make out a case, and that party bears
the onus of proof, and where that case could be given positive support by
calling evidence
of legal advice or lack of legal advice, the failure of that
party to call that evidence can be taken into account in deciding whether
that
party has discharged the onus of proof which it bears.  The plaintiff's
solicitor accepted that this was so during argument.
 I take that view into
account in reaching the conclusion that I do reach, because my view that the
upholding of privilege does not
involve unfairness to the defendant does depend
upon my view that the defendant is not precluded from commenting on, and
relying
on, the failure of the plaintiff to support its case by giving evidence
about its legal advice, or lack of legal advice, on this
point.
<P>

16  	Turning to the situation at common law, I think substantially
the same position holds.  The common law position approaches
questions of
consent and waiver without the necessity of fitting those questions into the
words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122</a>; but I think it is fair to say that, if one approaches <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122</a> in
the way in which the majority did in <u>Telstra Corporation v. BT
Australia</u>, there really is very little difference between the two
positions.
<P>

17  	In any event, for the same reasons that I have given in relation
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122</a>, in my opinion the material before me is not sufficient to establish
consent to the production of the material or waiver of the privilege
according
to common law principles.
<P>

<center>(Submissions on costs)</center>
<P>


<P>

18  	I refuse the inspection of the documents.
<P>

19  	I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the
hearing before me today, but I reserve leave for the defendant
to apply to have
that order set aside if, through some change of direction or evidence
voluntarily given by the plaintiff, privilege
is subsequently waived.
