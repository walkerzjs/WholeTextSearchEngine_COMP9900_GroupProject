<P>

<b>3240/98	ALLAN DAVID JAMES HILLSTON   -v-   MICHAEL JACOB BAR-MORDECAI</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>    There is presently before the Court a
notice of motion filed by the plaintiff, Allan David James Hillston on 25
November 1998.
 By that notice of motion the plaintiff seeks the appointment of
trustees for sale of certain real property situate and known as
30 Eastbourne
Avenue, Clovelly pursuant to the provisions of Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a>.
<P>

2   	The motion is brought in substantive proceedings which were
instituted by statement of claim filed by the plaintiff on 22 July
1998.  The
defendant to those proceedings is Michael Jacob Bar-Mordecai.  The plaintiff
brings the substantive proceedings in his
capacity as the administrator to whom
probate of the will of the late Eveline Hillston was granted on 22 October
1998.  That grant
was made in consequence of substantial and lengthy
proceedings conducted in the Probate Division, the trial of which before
Einstein
J occupied some four weeks.  His Honour's judgment extended over 137
pages.
<P>

3   	In the Probate proceedings the present defendant, Dr
Bar-Mordecai was the plaintiff.  There were two defendants in the Probate
proceedings, Thelma Rockman, the sister of the deceased (who, if it were
ultimately to have been held that the deceased died intestate,
would as such
sister have been entitled to the entirety of the estate of the deceased upon
intestacy) and Alex Hillston, who was
appointed in a representative capacity as
a beneficiary and to represent all other beneficiaries named in the will of the
deceased
dated 31 August 1989.
<P>

4   	It was in essence the claim of Dr Bar-Mordecai in the
Probate proceedings that that will had been revoked by the deceased during
her
lifetime, in which event the deceased died intestate.  To that point the
interests of Dr Bar-Mordecai and Thelma Rockman, the
first defendant in the
Probate proceedings, were identical.  Both were asserting an intestacy.
However, Dr Bar-Mordecai in the Probate
proceedings further asserted that he
was at the time of her death the de facto husband of the deceased, and thus
that he, and not
Mrs Rockman, the sister of the deceased, was entitled to the
entire estate of the deceased upon intestacy.  There was no dispute
by either
of those two parties that the deceased had executed a will on 31 August 1989
but those two parties were unanimous in asserting
that that will had been
revoked before the death of the deceased and that no later will had come into
existence.
<P>

5   	Neither Dr Bar-Mordecai nor Mrs Rockman had an interest in
asserting the validity and efficacy of the 1989 will at the time
of the death
of the deceased. It was therefore only proper, in the orderly administration of
estates of deceased persons, that there
should be a party in opposition to
assert that the 1989 will had effect.  For that reason, therefore, Mr Alex
Hillston was joined
as the second defendant to the Probate proceedings.  
<P>

6   	In the event, Einstein J concluded that the 1989 will had
not been revoked by the deceased, that that was the last valid will
of the
deceased, and that it was therefore proper that a grant of probate should be
made in respect of that will.  Since the representative
defendant, Mr Alex
Hillston ultimately was totally successful in the Probate proceedings, and
since he was not a resident within
the jurisdiction of the Court, he residing
in Greece, the grant of probate of the will was ultimately made to his brother,
the present
plaintiff, Mr Allan David James Hillston, who resides in Sydney.
<P>

7   	The costs orders made by Einstein J in the Probate
proceedings clearly reflected the view of his Honour that the representative
defendant, ultimately and totally successful, should not personally bear his
costs of the proceedings and that, to the extent that
he might not recover
those costs from Dr Bar-Mordecai, he was entitled to resort to the assets of
the estate.  
<P>

8   	Dr Bar-Mordecai has instituted an appeal from the decision
of Einstein J in the Probate proceedings.  No date has yet been
fixed for the
hearing of that appeal.  Nevertheless the hearing had been given by the Court
of Appeal what is described in a letter
dated 13 April 1999 from the Registrar
of the Court of Appeal "a degree of expedition".  The appeal will be case
managed by Stein
JA who will conduct the directions call-over in the matter on
3 May 1999.  No indication has been placed before me in the hearing
of the
present application concerning when it is likely that the appeal will be
heard.
<P>

9   	One of the assets of the estate of the deceased was an
interest as to two-thirds therein of the house property at 30 Eastbourne
Avenue, Clovelly.  The other one-third interest therein is held in the name of
the present defendant, Dr Bar-Mordecai.  The deceased
and Dr Bar-Mordecai held
their respective interests in the property as tenants in common.  
<P>

10   	The present plaintiff as the administrator under the grant
of probate to which I have already referred is thus entitled to
seek relief of
the nature contemplated by the Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> and
to seek to have appointed trustees for the sale of the property.  However, Dr
Bar-Mordecai has applied by way of notice of motion
filed on 8 March 1999 for
an order that the substantive notice of motion of the plaintiff filed on 25
November 1998 be stayed until
the determination of his appeal in the Probate
proceedings.
<P>

11   	I have accordingly entertained firstly the application by
the present defendant for such a stay of the present plaintiff's
application
for the appointment of trustees for sale.  
<P>

12   	It will be appreciated that the fact that Dr Bar-Mordecai
has instituted an appeal does not of itself affect the orders which
were made
by Einstein J in the Probate proceedings.  Those orders are the final orders of
the Court. They are in no way to be regarded
as conditional or provisional.
They have the entirety of the force of final orders unless and until they are
discharged or varied
or set aside by the Court of Appeal.  There is no
presumption that the appeal will necessarily be successful.
<P>

13   	Indeed to the extent that it is appropriate that I do so
in considering the various submissions placed before me on behalf
of Dr
Bar-Mordecai in support of a stay, it is very clear from the reasons in the
judgment of Einstein J, in which he expressed the
strongest possible views
concerning the evidence of Dr Bar-Mordecai, the manner of his giving of that
evidence, his demeanour and
the general credibility of his evidence, that the
likelihood of his Honour's findings concerning Dr Bar-Mordecai and his evidence
being overturned is in my view very slight.
<P>

14   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that if
the Court proceeds to entertaining the substantive application for
the
appointment of statutory trustees, and if (as the defendant appears to regard
as being not unlikely upon such a substantive application)
the Court were to
make the orders sought for the appointment of such trustees for sale, then the
practical consequence would be that
Dr Bar-Mordecai would no longer be able to
continue to reside in the Eastbourne Avenue residence which has been his home
for the
past eight or nine years, and that, in the event that he were later to
succeed in his appeal in the Probate proceedings, it would
be impossible for
him to recover that residence.  It was submitted therefore on behalf of the
defendant that there would be irreversible
prejudice to Dr Bar-Mordecai if the
Court were not to stay the plaintiff's present application.  
<P>

15   	For the plaintiff however it has been submitted firstly
that Dr Bar-Mordecai was totally unsuccessful in the proceedings before
Einstein J, and that the consequence of his Honour's decision in the Probate
proceedings is that the present plaintiff has the administration
of the estate
of the deceased. In the course of that administration the plaintiff is a
respondent to the appeal which has been instituted
by Dr Bar-Mordecai.  The
plaintiff has incurred and will incur costs in respect of that appeal.  The
representative defendant in
the Probate proceedings has incurred very
considerable costs which his Honour's costs orders contemplated should not be
borne personally
by that representative defendant.
<P>

16   	The evidence discloses that there are presently
outstanding legal costs in the order of $300,000 for which the estate is liable
and that the liquid cash assets of the estate currently amount to less than
$10,000.  The estate cannot pay its accounts without
access to the assets of
the estate. The nature of those assets is such that the most appropriate one to
which the estate says that
it should be able to have resort is the interest of
the deceased in the Eastbourne Avenue property.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff also points to the fact that there is one
other piece of residential property which is an asset in the estate
of the
deceased, being a home unit situate at and known as unit 1/6 Mount Street,
Clovelly.  Thus, in the event that the order sought
by the plaintiff for the
appointment of trustees for sale of the Eastbourne Avenue residence is made,
the practical consequence would
not be to deprive Dr Bar-Mordecai of a home,
since under the terms of the will of which the plaintiff is the administrator
Dr Bar-Mordecai
has an entitlement to occupation in that property during his
life without any fee or rental.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff also acknowledges that, were the net
proceeds of the interest of the deceased in the Eastbourne Avenue property
to
be distributed in accordance with the terms of the will to the various
beneficiaries named therein, it would be very difficult
for Dr Bar-Mordecai, in
the event that he were to succeed in his appeal, to recover the amount so
distributed, since with the exception
of the present plaintiff each of those
beneficiaries resides outside Australia.  For that reason, therefore, the
plaintiff has limited
the terms of its substantive application under Division 6
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the Act to orders which would firstly appoint the trustees for
sale and require them to sell the property on the statutory trust
and
thereafter then to hold the net proceeds of sale after payment of all expenses
of the sale, including their own fees and expenses,
pending the further order
of the Court, and that further leave be granted to either party, to a former
solicitor of Dr Bar-Mordecai
and to the trustees to apply to the Court on seven
days' notice.
<P>

19   	In considering the application by the defendant for a stay
of the plaintiff's motion it is necessary for me to perform an
exercise of
weighing up and balancing the prejudice to Dr Bar-Mordecai if the Eastbourne
Avenue property is now sold and if he ultimately
be successful in his appeal,
with the prejudice to the plaintiff if Dr Bar-Mordecai ultimately be
unsuccessful in his appeal and
the plaintiff has to wait until the final
determination of that appeal before any assets of the estate become available
to him to
meet the very considerable costs for which the estate is liable in
respect to the Probate proceedings through the representative
party, Mr Alex
Hillston, in those proceedings and in respect to the present appeal.
<P>

20   	If Dr Bar-Mordecai did not have alternative accommodation
available to him there would be very considerable strength in his
submissions
concerning prejudice.  However, since he will not find himself deprived of
accommodation if he has to leave Eastbourne
Avenue, as he will be able to
reside in the Mount Street unit, it seems to me that that prejudice, on
balance, is less than the prejudice
which would be suffered by the plaintiff in
being deprived of the ability to resort to the assets of the estate to pay the
very considerable
amount of legal costs presently outstanding.  Also, as I have
already observed, a further factor relevant to this question is the
strength of
the appeal of Dr Bar-Mordecai. I have already expressed my views that it is
unlikely that the Court of Appeal would overturn
any of the findings of
Einstein J concerning the evidentiary matters at the trial and especially
concerning the credibility of Dr
Bar-Mordecai.
<P>

21   	For those reasons therefore I do not propose to grant the
stay which has been sought by the defendant, and I propose to dismiss
his
notice of motion.
<P>

22   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that the notice of motion filed by the defendant on 8 March 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

(2)	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of the aforesaid
notice of motion.
<P>

(3)	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>

23   	I am satisfied that it is appropriate for me to make an
order of the nature sought in the notice of motion filed by the plaintiff
on 25
November 1998.   The plaintiff has prepared short minutes of order, the effect
of which is that the disposition of the net
proceeds of sale will require
further order of the Court.  
<P>

24   	I will have it noted that Mr Whittle of Counsel on behalf
of the plaintiff administrator of the estate of the deceased, states
that, in
accordance with his instructions, if Dr Bar-Mordecai so requests, the premises
at Mount Street, Clovelly will be made available
for him pursuant to the
provisions of the will of the deceased, and that those premises would be made
available within a reasonably
short time.
<P>

25   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I make orders as in the short minutes of order dated 16 April 1999,
initialled by me and filed in Court this day.
<P>

(2)	I order that the costs of each party of the notice of motion filed by the
plaintiff on 25 November 1998 be paid out of the proceeds
of sale of the land
referred to in paragraph 1 thereof.
<P>

	The exhibits may be returned.
