<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  On 29 October 1990 I made orders disposing in principle of the
claims in these proceedings and on 29 September 1993
an appeal against those
orders was dismissed: <b><i>Brown v Brown </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d1993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-1993) 31 NSWLR 582.</a>
When the Summons was issued on 5 April 1990 the late Mrs Alice Veronica Brown
was the plaintiff.  She died on 29 August 1990, during
the hearing.  On 21
September 1990 I appointed her daughters to conduct the proceedings as
representing her estate and they have
since obtained a grant of Probate which
confirms their standing to be plaintiffs.  The proceedings relate to the
beneficial ownership
of the house property with surrounding land at Nos.
118-120 Morrison Road, Gladesville, formerly the land in Certificate of Title
Volume 4919 Folio 227 of which the defendants were registered proprietors.  The
house and land were Lots 12 and 13 in Deposited Plan
2166.  The land was
subdivided by Deposited Plan 789012 registered on 3 May 1989 into two lots, Lot
100 in area 652 square metres,
on which the house at 118 Morrison Road stands
and Lot 101, then vacant land in area 1774 square metres, referred to as No.
120 Morrison
Road, with frontage to Morrison Road of 19.685 metres and a large
rear area accessible only from Morrison Road.  The defendants are
still the
registered proprietors of Lot 100 and the house, and Declaration 1 of my orders
establishes that they hold it on trust
for the estate of Mrs Alice Veronica
Brown in the proportion of 2,125 parts in 4,800 parts; and the defendants
themselves are the
beneficial owners of the other 2,675 parts.  The defendants
sold Lot 101, and also the adjoining Lot 15 DP2166, in one sale for $670,000
by
contract dated 7 October 1988 to Orlit Pty Limited - Exhibit E.  The sale was
completed on 13 July 1989 and the net proceeds received
by the defendants were
$654,300.   Lot 15 was the adjoining lot to the south at the rear of Nos.
118-120 Morrison Road, which the
defendants acquired about 1985 in a
transaction in which Mrs Alice Brown had no interest.  Lot 15 had frontage and
access to Kemp
Street, so the land sold had frontages to both Morrison Road and
Kemp Street. No claim was made that the acquisition and disposal
of Lot 15
brought with it any consequences of the kind associated with <b><i>Keech v.
Sandford </i></b>(1726) Sel Ca t. King 61; <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1726/J76.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1726] EngR 954</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=25%20ER%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">25 ER 223</a><b>.</b>
<P>

2		In 1998 I heard the Inquiry directed earlier to ascertain the amount of
proceeds of the sale of Lot 101 which is subject to the
trust.  The trust was a
resulting trust, a bare trust with no express powers, and the sale was in
breach of trust as the late Mrs
Alice Brown had not authorised it.  The remedy
to which her estate is entitled is an account for and payment of 2125 parts in
4800
parts of so much of the proceeds of sale as is attributable to inclusion
of Lot 101 in the sale.  The attributable part is obscure
because there was a
further breach of trust in that the defendants mixed and confused the interests
of the trust with their own interests
by selling Lot 15 in the same sale as Lot
101, and the purchase price was undifferentiated.  By acting in breach of trust
the defendants
incurred whatever disadvantages flow from doubt about an
appropriate apportionment.  Disapproval of their conduct is mitigated by
the
enhancement of the realisation for the sale of each parcel achieved by selling
them in one line; the development potential of
both and each was plainly
enhanced.  Claims 6 and 7 relate to accounting for and payment of the proceeds
of Lot 101.
<P>

3		I also heard the further consideration of several claims in the Summons.
Claims 2 and 5  relate to Lot 100, the house at No.
118 Morrison Road of which
the defendants are still registered proprietors, and claim appointment of
trustees under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, sale and distribution of the
proceeds.
<P>

4		Claim 8 relates to interlocutory restraint and has been dealt with thus far
as follows.  On 21 September 1990 the defendants
gave the following
undertaking:
<P>

	<i>	"The defendants by their counsel undertake to the Court that they will not
without leave of the Court permit the total of the balances
standing to their
credit in accounts at the State Bank at Gladesville to be reduced below
$225,000."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>On the same day I made an interlocutory order restraining the
defendants from <i>"selling or otherwise disposing of or mortgaging or
otherwise encumbering Lot 100 in Deposited Plan 789012."</i>  On 12 August 1996
the following direction was made by consent by a Registrar.
<P>

	<i>	"That the defendants on or before 19 August 1996 provide to the plaintiff
written evidence from the State Bank of NSW Gladesville
of the defendants'
deposit of at least $225,000 and copy of direction to the State Bank by the
defendants not to disburse the deposit
without consent of the plaintiffs and/or
Court order".</i>
<P>

5		Further consideration of claims for damages and interest was also
reserved.
<P>

6		The Inquiry and further consideration came on for hearing on Monday 16
February 1998.  No evidence explains this long interval.
 I deal first with the
Inquiry and the proceeds of the sale of Lot 101.  The net proceeds of $654,300
are an agreed fact.  It is
then necessary to identify the part of that net
amount which is the subject of the resulting trust.  
<P>

7		Much evidence of valuers was directed to the contribution of Lot 101
DP789012 to the total proceeds of sale of the consolidated
land.  At times the
presentation of the defendants' case seemed to assume that anything not shown
to be attributable to Lot 101 should
be attributed to Lot 15 and pass to the
defendants.  That assumption has no proper basis.  When the consolidated land
was sold in
one line it became different to the sum of the two parts; the
development potential of the whole was different to, greater than and
of
greater value than the development potential of each, and of the sum of both.
In the state of facts which actually existed, in
which the defendants also
owned Lot 15 DP 2166 with its Kemp Street frontage an address to the valuation
of lot 101 on its own is
rather artificial.  It is very unlikely that the
defendants would have sold Lot 101 on its own, as it was very obvious that the
value
of both lots would be enhanced by consolidating them.  The same
artificiality affects addressing the value of Lot 15 on its own as
it too
obviously gained in value from consolidation.
<P>

8	     In selling Lot 101 the defendants acted in breach of trust in that no
power of sale was conferred on them.  If the defendants
had sold Lot 101 on its
own to a person who had no opportunity to consolidate they would have incurred
no blame but they would have
missed the advantage.  The exercise is one of
apportioning the advantage which flowed from the unauthorised action which
created
it  The breach was a judicious one, evidently advantageous to those
interested in the trust.  The plaintiffs have not suggested otherwise,
and by
the manner in which they presented their claim for part of the proceeds of the
sale they did not impeach the defendants' conduct
in selling the land.  The
ground on which the defendants are accountable is that they as trustees may not
profit from dealings in
trust property, and may not mix their own interests
with the interests of the trust and earn an advantage for both, as in so doing
they employ trust property for their own advantage.  In a survey of texts I
have not observed an analogous case where trustees have
sold trust property and
property of their own in one line and derived a profit.  Many cases have dealt
with mixing trust money with
the money of trustees, with mixing the moneys of
two different trusts, and with gaining advantages by cumulating the voting
power
of trust shares with the voting power of privately owned shares.  The
principle that a trustee may not profit from dealings in trust
property is
sometimes stated in absolute terms in the authorities, but normally there is
some recognition that there may be qualifications.
 The absolute principle
would make the defendants accountable to the trust for all profits derived from
the sale of the land; and
the profits would be ascertained by deducting the
value of their Lot 15 from the proceeds and treating the balance as the value
of
trust property which they ought to restore and the profits for which they
are accountable.  The value of the trust property would
not enter into the
calculation.  Where trustees have made investments with a mixture of trust
moneys and their own moneys and the
means of apportioning profits have been
readily and arithmetically available the courts have often apportioned them.

<P>

9	     At first instance in <b><i>Scott v Scott</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1964/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] VicRp 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20VR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) VR 300</a> at 307
Hudson J first stated the principle in absolute terms:
<P>

	<i>"Fundamental to the claim of the plaintiffs is the rule that a trustee may
not derive a profit from his trust.  He must not use or
deal with trust
property for his own private benefit and if he does so he is accountable for
any profits, benefits or advantage which
he may derive from such use or
dealing.  This it was said is a rule of the broadest scope extending into every
activity of any person
who occupies a fiduciary position."  </i>
<P>

<i>	</i>     But his Honour also apportioned the proceeds of a 
<P>

<i>	</i>mixed investment.
<P>

10	     On appeal in <b><i>Scott v Scott </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20109%20CLR%20649" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 109 CLR 649</a>
observations in the judgment of the High Court at 658-659 support a
constructive trust of all profits of a mixed investment, but
the case was not
disposed of on that basis; it could not be because of limitations arising from
the nature of the challenge on appeal
to the judgment of Hudson J, and their
Honours' obiter observations at 663-664 may support severing the proceeds of a
mixed investment;
or in any event do not express disapproval.
<P>

11	     The proceeds of a mixed investment were severed in <b><i>Paul A. Davies
(Australia) Pty Ltd (in Liq) v Davies &amp; Anor </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%20440" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 440</a>
Mahoney JA spoke of apportionment of profit in guarded language not necessarily
expressing his approval:  See 458 B-C.
<P>

12	     The observations of Deane J in <b><i>Chan v Zacharia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154
CLR 178</a> at 198-199, 204-205, although directed to a different part of the
subject, support the maintenance of some flexibility.  Little flexibility
is
required when there are ready means of apportionment.  See too <b><i>Warman
International Ltd v Dwyer </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 544</a> at 556-562.
<P>

13	     The way in which courts have acted where the contributions from
different sources have been readily measurable shows that
simple application of
the absolute principle is not always appropriate.  Equitable remedies should be
administered with regard to
the facts and circumstances in detail of particular
cases.  In this case the evidence of valuers enables findings to be made of the
values of each lot, with the difficulties to which valuations of real property
are characteristically subject.  The decision to sell
was a judicious decision
and the defendants' conduct in selling it is explained by their genuine belief
that they were the beneficial
owners, not a reasonable belief but a belief
which they truly held.  The sale of the two properties was not a cloak for
machinations
to put their own interest at some advantage over Mrs Alice Brown's
interest; their fault was in disputing her interest, not in selling
the
property.  In discerning the appropriate equitable remedy in this case and
attempting to proceed with due regard to analogies
presented by equitable
remedies in earlier decisions I do not think it is appropriate to apply the
absolute principle when means
are at hand to apportion that advantage in the
same proportion as the value of the parcels contributed. I will apply the
proportion
of the values which Lot 101 and Lot 15 would each have had if sold
unconsolidated to the net proceeds of sale of the consolidated
site.  A broad
approach to the discernment of a just remedy must be made.  In my judgment it
is equitable and it is just to apportion
the net proceeds that way.
<P>

14	  Lot 15 had development potential for a development containing a single
dwelling house or alternatively a development of three
villa units with
frontage to Kemp Street, and Lot 101 had qualified development potential for
four villa units.  The development
potential of Lot 101 was qualified because
it was uncertain whether development approval could be obtained for development
for villa
units with street access to Morrison Road frontage, as Ryde City's
Council's code, to which Council could make discretionary variations,
required
a strip of land 20 metres wide and the available land was somewhat narrower.
It was also uncertain whether Council would
give development consent for villa
units on land with frontage to Morrison Road which was classed as a collector
road, as there were
adverse indications in the Council's code.  The alternative
to developing Lot 101 for villa units was to subdivide it into two housing
lots
with a long access strip.  Development consent for three villa units on Lot 15
presented no real difficulty. The consolidation
meant that there were very
favourable prospects of consent to a development of seven villa units with
frontage to Kemp Street, and
one housing lot with frontage to Morrison Road.
This was not put to the test because Orlit Pty Ltd, the purchaser from the
defendants
acquired yet further land from another adjacent owner and obtained
development approval for nine villa units and one housing lot,
and that
development was carried out.
<P>

15		In 1988 Lot 101 had potential for development as villas in that it had
sufficient area for the construction of more than five
villa units;  by the
calculations of Mr Architect Poole, 5.9 villa units.  The available area is
only one of the considerations affecting
a development application. Another
consideration was that access to the villa development would be by way of the
Morrison Road frontage;
 Morrison Road was described for Town Planning purposes
as a collector road and carried relatively heavy local traffic, and Town
Planning considerations would support limiting development with vehicle access
to Morrison Road or directing development towards
access to side roads.
Another consideration was that Lot 101 had a frontage to Morrison Road of
19.685 metres and its effective lateral
width was 18.98 metres by my
calculation (although not calculated in evidence), whereas the development code
by which Council then
usually acted required access 20 metres wide.  There was
also the need to produce a development proposal for layout and internal
traffic
which Council found satisfactory.  From the point of view of a hypothetical
purchaser of Lot 101 there were prospects of
obtaining development approval for
villa units, but approval would be obtained only if Council took a favourable
view of the development
and there were factors which indicated that Council
well might not.  Development potential for villa units was distinctly qualified
and this would have had a moderating affect on value. 
<P>

16	     If Lot 15 had been offered for sale on its own in 1988 or 1989 it also
would have had potential for development of villa
units.  Its dimensions and
its frontage to Kemp Street, a quiet side street which carried less traffic
than Morrison Road, meant
that a development application for three villa units
was likely to be approved.  It is in issue whether development of villa units
was the highest and best use of Lot 15 as it was suitable for development for a
single dwelling.
<P>

17	     The development undertaken by the purchaser Orlit Pty Ltd serves, with
qualifications, to illustrate the development potential
of Lot 101 and Lot 15
when consolidated. Consolidation created a parcel the value of which was
attributable largely to its potential
for redevelopment in seven villa units
and a house lot.  Special Condition 3 in the Orlit contract made completion
conditional on
obtaining approval for a seven-unit development.  Although
development approvals are discretionary there was a fair certainty of
obtaining
approval for the seven villa units and a single dwelling on Morrison Road
frontage.  With the excision of a single-dwelling
lot, the land from Lot 101
which was consolidated with Lot 15 was almost large enough in area to meet the
Council's area requirements
according to its code for four villa units
(although this calculation is inter-dependent with the size of the
single-dwelling units
to be built).  Of course the rear of Lot 101 could not
have been developed for villa units on its own as it did not have street
access.
<P>

18	    Orlit Pty Ltd did not need to rely on Special Condition 3 because it was
able to do even better.  Orlit Pty Ltd purchased
other adjoining land, Lot B
FP364730, a small parcel with frontage to Kemp Street which had once been part
of Lot 14 DP2166 with
house No. 116 Morrison Road at the corner of Morrison
Road and Kemp Street, and had been sub-divided from it in 1947.  By Deposited
Plan 805387 Orlit Pty Ltd consolidated Lot 101, Lot 15 and Lot B and subdivided
them into Lot 200, comprising Lot B and Lot 15 and
the rear of Lot 101, and Lot
201 which had been the front of Lot 101 and became the site for a single
dwelling with Morrison Road
frontage.  The area of Lot 200 and its Kemp Street
frontage enabled Orlit Pty Ltd to obtain approval for and construct a complex
of nine villa homes - Strata Plan 38787, and Orlit also constructed and sold
off a single dwelling on Lot 201. Development consent
of 14 December 1988,
Exhibit K approved the subdivision of Lots 12 and 13, DP2166 into Lots 100 and
101.  Development consent obtained
(Exhibit J) on 31 May 1989 related to Lot
101, Lot 15 and Lot B and approved nine villa units. 
<P>

19	    Efforts to hypothesise the value of Lot 101 to an owner of Lot 15, or of
Lot 15 to an owner of Lot 101 are elusive, and these
sales could not have
happened in the practical world in 1988 when they were in common ownership.  To
an owner of Lot 15, acquiring
Lot 101 offered the potential for turning a
single-dwelling or three villa unit development site into a seven villa unit
development
together with another single-dwelling site, while to an owner of
Lot 101 consolidation with Lot 15 offered the prospect of turning
a doubtful
four villa unit development into a fairly certain seven villa unit development
together with a housing lot. 
<P>

20	     Discussion and debate in the course of evidence about how many of the
villa units in a development of seven units would
actually have stood on land
forming part of Lot 101 were extensive, but contribute nothing to my
conclusion; the development potential
of the consolidated land is different to
and of greater value than the development potential of either part.  Several
expert witnesses
dealt with identifying how many villa units or parts of villa
units in a development of seven villa units would have actually stood
on what
was formerly Lot 101 and how many units in the eventual development of nine
units stood on Lot 101.  This was completely
unproductive.  What the
consolidation created was new in its development potential.
<P>

21	     When the Inquiry first came on for hearing in February 1998 the
valuation evidence tendered was directed principally to
the appropriate
apportionment of the proceeds of the sale of the two parcels in one line to
Orlit Pty Limited.  I found this body
of evidence unsatisfactory because the
apportionments supported were conclusions based not only on matters of facts
and the expert
opinions of the valuers, but also on views about the fair and
appropriate basis for apportionment, and that is not correctly to be
dealt with
by expert opinions.  The principles of apportionment are for the Court's
judgment. 
<P>

22	     The valuation evidence proceeded on principles which I find difficult
to state; in some way it was assumed that a fair approach
involves working
backwards from the net proceeds and considering what contribution Lot 101 made
to rendering the consolidation suitable
to development for villa units.  What
was under consideration was, I think, what particular advantages flowed to the
project of developing
Lot 15 for villa home units by adding Lot 101.  This led
Mr Phippen, valuer, in his report of 23 January 1997 and affidavit of 30
January 1997 to an exercise of which he said:
<P>

	<i>"...We have not been instructed to assess the market value of the property
- we were only instructed to determine what proportion
of the proceeds of the
sale that occurred at that time should apply to the subject property."</i>
<P>

23	     In this exercise he addressed how many of the units to be built in the
development would actually stand on Lot 101 and how
many on Lot 15.  The
hypothetical development exercise Annexure C to the report with Mr Phippen's
affidavit of 12 February 1998 proceeds
on a similar assumption.  
<P>

24	    I do not accept these approaches. Apportionment by land area or rate per
square metre and consideration of the number of
units in the redevelopment
which actually stand on the former Lot 101 do not appear to me to have any
validity as methods of apportionment.
 Once the parcels are consolidated the
development potential and the design possibilities are completely recast, and
every part of
the consolidated land makes much the same contribution to the
outcome, whether it ends up as open space, access way or dwelling site.
 The
approaches also seem to me to involve elements of an assumption that the
trustees were in some way to be associated more closely
with the redevelopment
than they actually were; they did no more than consolidate the parcels and sell
them on to the developer.

<P>

25	   To my mind the just method does not involve reasoning back from the final
result and does not involve considering what contribution
each parcel made in
any terms but its value on its own.
<P>

26	    For these reasons I have disregarded Mr Phippen's conclusion in his
report of 23 January 1997 that the value of Lot 101 as
part of the total
development site sold for $670,000 would be $400,000 and his report of 10
February 1997 Annexure C to his affidavit
of 11 February 1998 in which, on one
set of assumptions, his apportionment to Lot 101 was as high as $414,000.  Mr
Bleus, valuer,
who was called by the defendants, also made an apportionment in
which he apportioned $300,000 of $670,000 to the land on Morrison
Road, and
$370,000 of $670,000 to the Kemp Street land:  See his letter of 8 August 1996,
Exhibit F and his affidavit of 15 November
1996, paragraph 6.  I have also
disregarded this.
<P>

27	     I made some observations on this and other subjects at the end of the
third hearing day, 18 February 1998.  There was a
long interval before the
Inquiry could be resumed on 3 August 1998 and some further valuation evidence
was assembled.  Mr Phippen
prepared a report dated 3 June 1998 which is annexed
to his affidavit of 16 June 1998 and deals with the valuation of 120 Morrison
Road as at 7 October 1988 the date of the Orlit contract.  At that date 120
Morrison Road was vacant.  The valuation which is relevant
is in my view the
valuation of the land which the defendant sold to Orlit; that land was
identified as Lot 101 on a plan annexed
to the contract, and the plan when
registered on 3 May 1989 became DP289012.  The Deposited Plan is exactly the
same as the plan
annexed to the contract in what it shows as Lot 101. 
<P>

28	     According to my understanding of his report of 3 June 1998 the subject
land which Mr Phippen valued was not exactly Lot
101; at paragraph 3.1 he says
that when the subdivision (which means DP789012) was registered the subject
comprised of Lot 101 and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p50ot" class="autolink_findacts">part Lot</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p100" class="autolink_findacts">100</a>, and he points out in his report at
paragraph 3.5 his view that the subdivision could have been effected in a
slightly different
way in which more land would have been thrown into Lot 101
and less into Lot 100, and (at paragraph 4.2) Lot 101 could have been
20 metres
wide which would have overcome the difficulty with the Council's code.  
<P>

29	    DP789012 shows at two points the distance between the house No. 118 on
Lot 100 and the western boundary of Lot 100; at one
point the distance is 1.28
metres and at another the distance is 1.225 metres.  This would suggest that
the boundary could have been
placed a little further east than it was; it could
have been 0.325 metres eastward and still maintained 0.9 metres clearance from
the house.  If that had been done, there would still not, it seems to me, have
been a strip with a perpendicular width of 20 metres
forming part of Lot 101.
As well as maintaining clearance of 0.9 metres from the wall it is necessary to
maintain clearance of 0.685
metres from eaves and gutters, and it was the
evidence of Mr Bleus that this could not be done, although he did not have any
precise
measurements to offer.  
<P>

30	     A subdivision which achieved a perpendicular width of 20 metres would
require that the structure of the house No. 118 be
altered in some way, and
there is no evidence establishing that this would be practicable or economic.
Any boundary alteration which
would reduce the curtilege of house No. 118 could
be expected to have adverse affects on the value of Lot 100.  Mr Phippen
contemplated
reduction from 653 square metres to 580 square metres, about
one-ninth of the area.  I doubt whether it was feasible to recast Lot
101 in
the way Mr Phippen has contemplated, but whether or not it was feasible, the
correct approach in principle is to value the
land actually sold; there is no
basis for imposing liability on the defendants on the footing that they did not
make an appropriate
decision about how the land was to be subdivided.
<P>

31	     Mr Phippen addressed the value of the property he identified as 120
Morrison Road, Gladesville by considering its potential
as:
<P>

1.  A large single residential building block; and his valuation on this basis
was $200,000.
<P>

2.  A two-building block in-globo subdivision; and he considered its value on
this basis was $215,000.
<P>

3.  A four-villa home development site; and he considered its value on this
basis was $300,000.   He made a hypothetical development
analysis which
produced $275,000 and an analysis by reference to a rate per villa site based
on another sale of a property suitable
for redevelopment as villa units nearby
in July 1989, and after considering factors of comparability which in his
opinion produced
a rate of $75,000 per villa site or $300,000 for the whole
property.  
<P>

32	    Mr Phippen's valuation reasoning was challenged at a number of points.
The principal challenge was his conclusion that the
highest and best use of Lot
101 was that it should be acquired by a developer for use in a development of
four villa units, which
necessarily would have a frontage to Morrison Road.  I
am satisfied that Lot 101 is sufficiently large and that its layout is such
that it is feasible to construct four villa units on it; this was not really
challenged.  Much discussion in evidence about what
unit development on Lot 101
was feasible was directed to construction of units on a consolidated site.  The
evidence of Mr Ian Poole,
architect was directed to the development potential
of both lots for villa units; but he substantially addressed the development
potential of Lot 101 in consolidation with Lot 15 but with Lot 201 excised. 
<P>

33	     Significant detriments to the development potential were the
perpendicular width and the traffic considerations.  I do not
accept that the
deficiency in the perpendicular width, 1.02 metres short of the Council's code
requirement of 20 metres, would of
itself be a reason why development consent
for villa units would not have been available. Council had a discretion in the
matter,
Council's decisions were subject to appeal, and it is very unlikely
that this deficiency was critical. With good design it should
be possible to
put most or all the structure of the units in the wider section of the land
(referred to by counsel as the bulb) distant
from Morrison Road, and the
utility of the land closer to Morrison Road for access, visitor parking,
garbage and other utilities
and for an open set-back from the road is not
materially different at 18.98 metres to its utility at 20 metres.  Mr Phippen
cited
developments where less than 20 metres had been accepted; they were not
closely similar.  Mr Bleus claimed that his experience was
that Council never
departed from the 20 metre requirement.  It seems to me that the Council or
Court responsible for the decision
would probably allow the minor variation
involved.  
<P>

34	    More serious was the doubt raised by traffic requirements.  Morrison
Road was a collector road with relatively heavily traffic,
and the traffic
situation was complicated by a high point in the road a little to the east
which limited visibility to some extent.
 Although vehicle access to four
dwellings would not be very intense, it would be relatively more intense than
vehicle access to
one or two dwellings, and the traffic question would probably
loom large in the consideration of the Council or the Court when deciding
whether there should be development consent. There is less than complete
certainty that development consent for four villa units
would be obtained, and
that uncertainty would enter into the reasoning of the parties to the
transaction, which for valuation purposes
must be hypothesised, in which the
purchaser is a developer intending to develop Lot 101 for villa units.  Mr
Phippen did not make
any allowance for this contingency in his valuations, and
in my view he should have done so.
<P>

35	    Mr Bleus gave evidence that in 1988 when he was undertaking sale of the
properties for the defendants he asked the Ryde City
Council's Town Planner
what development of Lots 12 and 13 was feasible and was advised that the site
would not be available for villa
development.  An inquiry of this kind is not a
fair test of the development potential of the land, and a recollection of an
oral
answer to an inquiry ten years earlier is not a reliable indication of the
Council's attitude.  It may very well be that the Council's
Town Planner did no
more than point out that in the Villa Homes Code there were restrictions on the
development of villas on collector
roads; he ought to have pointed that out in
response to such an inquiry.  I do not accept that this evidence of Mr Bleus
establishes
how an application for development consent would have been dealt
with, or what view an informed developer would have taken of the
prospect when
he considered whether to purchase Lot 101.
<P>

36	     I do not regard the supporting reasoning for Mr Phippen's valuation of
$300,000 as strong.  His hypothetical development
analysis suffers from the
characteristic difficulty that these analyses introduce a number of integers
which are themselves the products
of opinion and assessment and not capable of
concrete demonstration; the projected sale price of the units is the most
important
of these, but there are other elements which are matters of opinion
and reasonably subject to variation according to how the hypothetical
developer
chose to manage affairs.  The result of a hypothetical development analysis is
sensitive to variations not only in the
sale prices hypothesised but also in
development costs, construction costs, development period, the interest rate
and in the profit
and risk factor required by the hypothetical developer.  The
elements which produce Mr Phippen's figure of $275,000 are not highly
concrete.
His figure of $75,000 per villa site is based on adjustments from one sale,
effected in July 1989, nine months later, in
a superior location and discounted
after consideration of factors of comparability, and is not highly concrete
either.  Mr Phippen's
other valuations on the basis of development as a single
dwelling and as a two lot subdivision were not subject to detailed challenge.

<P>

37	     Mr Bleus, who was called by the defendants, produced with his affidavit
of 14 February 1998 his valuation of 11 February
1998 in which he valued Lot
101 as at 7 October 1988 at $170,000.  This was the most substantial piece of
evidence produced by the
defendants in dealing with the subject, and it was
markedly disruptive that, in a hearing to begin on Monday, 16 February 1998,
evidence
of such importance appeared only in an affidavit sworn on the
preceding Saturday.  The defendants had well over seven years to prepare
for
the hearing of the Inquiry, and did not take even the most rudimentary steps to
participate in the inquiry on a basis which could
be procedurely fair to the
plaintiffs.  The defendants did not do anything reasonably to be expected of
trustees, did not produce
accounts in any form, however imperfect, and did not
give to the plaintiffs reasonable notice of what they proposed to bring
forward.
 The defendants' participation took markedly disruptive forms and did
not recognise the basic reality that it was for the defendants
as trustees to
account for themselves and their dealings.  The plaintiffs would not have made
any progress at all if they had not
embarked on the Inquiry on the footing that
they brought forward material for consideration, while the defendants did
nothing effectual
until the last moment.  To a large extent the defendant's
case was conducted on the footing, which was quite wrong, that the plaintiffs
bore the burden of establishing every relevant fact, as if the defendants did
not have a duty to account for their dealings.
<P>

38	     In Mr Bleus' report of 11 February 1998 he said that Lot 101 could not
be developed for villa homes in isolation because
of the 20 metre minimum
requirement in the Council code.  Although he adhered firmly to this position,
I am satisfied that this requirement
is not a reason why consent for villa
homes development was impossible; it was a difficulty, but overall not a
substantial difficulty
for obtaining consent.  Mr Bleus gave calculations which
produced a value of $170,000 for the site on the footing that its highest
and
best use was for development by subdivision into two housing lots, a
street-front lot and a battle-axe lot with a three-metre
access corridor.  In
his analysis the gross realisation for each of the lots to be created was
$140,000 making a total of $280,000,
and he allowed $78,100 for development
costs, costs of sales, interest on the development costs and a profit and risk
allowance (of
$40,000).  He also divided the net return by a denominator of
1.1935, which represents acquisition costs and interest on the land
and other
acquisition costs for the duration of the development.  
<P>

39	     It seems from Mr Phippen's evidence that it is a standard process to
reason in this way; Mr Phippen would adopt a lower
denominator, 1.1735.  Use of
a denominator masks the period of time from acquisition to realisation, which
is not stated by Mr Bleus,
and masks the rate of interest assumed.  The factor
of 1.1935 appears to assume interest of an amount of about 16% per annum for
one year on the net realisation.  If the reasoning were to be understood, it
would be necessary to know the interest rate, the period
involved and the
reason for applying it to the net realisation and not the amount outlaid.
<P>

40	   Overall, I did not find Mr Bleus' valuation methods impressive.  Mr
Bleus' valuation is highly sensitive to his appraisal
of the gross realisations
to be expected, and he did not produce any sales evidence for these.  Mr
Phippen, speaking somewhat off-hand,
as was forced on him by late production of
material, appraised the gross realisations as $160,000 to $170,000 for one lot,
and $140,000
to $150,000 for the other; taking the mean, $310,000.  He also
disputed Mr Bleus' development costs, but as they were stated at a
gross figure
it was difficult to take this to any detail. 
<P>

41	     In an earlier expression of opinion, Exhibit F, a letter from Mr Bleus
to the defendants's solicitor of 8 August 1996, Mr
Bleus assessed the gross
realisations at $150,000 and $120,000, totalling $270,000, with costs of
$30,000 producing $240,000 net
to the owner, to be reduced by a component for
profit and risk for a developer.  In exercises addressing an appropriate
division
of the net proceeds of the Orlit sale, Mr Bleus had attributed
$300,000 of $670,000 to the Morrison Road property and $370,000 to
the Kemp
Street property in his affidavit of 15 November 1996 and $248,000 for the
Morrison Road property and $422,000 to the Kemp
Street property in his
valuation of 13 February 1998 and his affidavit of 14 February 1998.  I do not
accept that the whole approach
of reasoning back from the net proceeds is
appropriate, but the lack of proportion among Mr Bleus' various exercises and
the contrast
between the views he expressed at different times is adverse to
confidence in his reasoning.
<P>

42	    The defendants also called the evidence of Mr Russell L. Jackson,
valuer.  In his first report of 23 September 1997 he followed
the apportionment
method and attributed $235,000 of $670,000 to Lot 101 and $435,000 to Lot 15.
However, he revised his work extensively
as his first report contained
acknowledged errors of method.  His second report, Exhibit 7, depended in
significant respects on co-operative
work with Mr Bleus, and adds little of
significant weight to Mr Bleus' opinions.  His second report proceeds on the
basis of assumed
availability of consolidation with Lot 15 and addresses unit
development as part of a development of the consolidated parcel.  Overall
Mr
Jackson's evidence can be looked to only for conclusions on the basis which I
have decided not to accept.
<P>

43	     If the highest and best use of Lot 101 is subdivision into two parcels
each for one dwelling house, I regard Mr Phippen's
valuation at $215,000 as
reliable.  I do not accept Mr Bleus' valuation of $170,000 and I would act on
Mr Phippen's conclusion. 
However, in my finding Lot 101 had significant
potential for redevelopment as four villa units and that potential would make a
marked
contribution to its value in the market as of October 1988.  Developers
of villa units would out-bid others, but they would be unlikely
to pay the
figures of $275,000 or $300,000 which Mr Phippen produced on bases which
assumed that development consent would be available;
 the hypothetical prudent
purchaser would discount these figures because of the element of doubt.  It is
also necessary to remember
that Mr Phippen valued a notional lot which would be
slightly larger than the actual Lot 101.  While there is no very clear basis
on
which to proceed and the uncertainty which besets all valuation is clearly
present,  I find that the value of Lot 101 was $245,000.
 
<P>

44	     In Mr Bleus' evidence tendered in August 1998, his Valuation Report
dated 26 February 1998 and letter of 16 July 1998 which
together form Exhibit
"10", he valued Lot 15 at the date of the Orlit sale at $312,000.  This
valuation was based on the view that
the improvements which then existed, a
three bedroom aluminium and fibro clad cottage, did not add value, and that
prospective purchasers
were people looking for a larger site to develop a
single residential property.  Mr Bleus saw the site as suitable for development
with three villas, and it is to be implied from his valuation methods that he
saw redevelopment for a large single residential property
as the highest and
best use.  (In this he differs from Mr Phippen).  Mr Bleus considered four
comparable sales, three of which were
nearby; the parcels were significantly
smaller in size and located at 130 Tennyson Road, 20 Bayview Street and 2 Kemp
Street.  The
sales occurred in March, May and August 1989.  Another sale at 28
Aitchandar Road, Ryde occurred in October 1988; it is of an even
larger parcel
and the sale price was $320,000.  It serves only to illustrate that large sums
could be obtained for very good residential
blocks.
<P>

45	     Mr Bleus' valuation rationale was to develop from the three nearby
sales, a rate of $290.00 per square metre which he applied
to Lot 15.  In my
view the application of a rate per square metre or other unit rate to the area
of residential land is inappropriate
and a more detailed address to
comparability ought to be undertaken; residential land is not fungible like
butter and the apparent
precision of reasoning by square metre of area is
spurious.  
<P>

46	     However, it does appear to me that Lot 15 Kemp Street if sold on its
own had significant advantages as a superior single
dwelling residential site.
It had some potential for development to take advantage of views westward, it
was in a relatively elevated
position in a quiet street, and a single dwelling
house could attain a height at which views could be enjoyed which could not be
realised with villa units, which would be subject to  height restrictions as
the floor could be no more than 1 metre above ground
level.  
<P>

47	    My view is that Lot 15 was a valuable residential lot, of higher
potential for residential redevelopment than Mr Phippen
would allow to it, and
that, although villa unit development on it was feasible, it was attractive
only when amalgamated with other
land.  All in all I feel that the Kemp Street
property had significant advantages over the three nearby comparable sales
referred
to by Mr Bleus:  see Paragraph 45 above.  Of the greatest importance
of the three is the sale of 2 Kemp Street which is on the opposite
side of Kemp
Street; the sale occurred in May 1989 and brought $292,000 for a parcel which
was significantly smaller, had greater
elevation and was later developed with a
new house.
<P>

48	     Mr Phippen valued Lot 15 in his affidavit of 16 June 1998 at $225,000.
In his view the then existing permalum and tiled
residence contributed little
to its value, and he valued the property as an existing residence at $220,000,
as a single residential
building block at $200,000 and as a home unit
development site for three villas at $225,000.  Earlier, in oral
evidence-in-chief
at T 37, he had given $243,715 as the value on the basis of a
three villa home unit development site. Mr Phippen was criticised in
cross-examination for his address to the valuation of Lot 15.  It was contended
that he had not taken adequate notice of the advantages
of Lot 15 over
comparable sales to which he referred with respect of size, views, and the
effect of traffic, and that he had not
had regard for 1989 sales.
<P>

49	     In my finding Mr Phippen did not make a correct conclusion about the
potential of Lot 15 for residential redevelopment;
it was much more attractive
and its potential for residential redevelopment was higher than Mr Phippen
considered it.
<P>

50	     Mr. Phippen made a critique of the comparable sales upon which Mr Bleus
relied.  Significant to this critique was Mr Phippen's
evidence to the effect
that in the Real Estate boom which it is notorious was in progress in 1987 and
1988, prices in the relevant
area continued to rise rapidly in 1989.  Mr
Phippen supported this by reference to his own experience as a Real Estate
Agent in Gladesville
at the time, and not by reference to any statistical
material.  Mr Bleus disputed the continuance of the rapid rise in 1989, and
claimed that published statistics supported him.  I am not satisfied that the
level of prices continued to rise between October 1988
and the dates of these
sales, particularly May 1989, the date of the Kemp Street sale, at the rate of
which Mr Phippen speaks, or
at a rate which would disentitle these sales to
consideration.  Mr Phippen also pointed to the fact that the property at No. 2
Kemp
Street was acquired by wealthy immigrants who did not demolish and rebuild
for some two years after acquisition; these circumstances
do not appear to me
to qualify its significance as an indicator of value. 
<P>

51	     I prefer to accept Mr Bleus in his appraisal of the potential of the
site, but I am unable to accept Mr Bleus' valuation
rationale and his
employment of a rate per square metre.  My finding is that comparable sales
referred to by Mr Bleus give a general
indication of the level of value, and
that although precision is not available I should find the value to be somewhat
higher than
the sale price of the smaller parcel of land at 2 Kemp Street.  I
find that the value of Lot 15 at the date of the Orlit sale was
$300,000.
<P>

52	     Under the claims for accounts, damages and interest, the plaintiffs
presented a claim in respect of the occupation of the
house No. 118 Morrison
Street on Lot 100, which since Mrs Alice Brown went to live in a nursing home
on 29 April 1987 has been occupied
by the second defendant Mr Jack Brown and
his family.  It is for consideration whether the defendants are or Mr Jack
Brown is accountable
to the plaintiffs for any sum for his occupation.
Evidence by Mr Phippen of the rental value from time to time was tendered and
was
not challenged in cross-examination or by countervailing valuations.  If an
occupation fee is payable other elements enter into establishing
its amount,
such as expenditures on municipal rates, land taxes, repairs and any other
outgoings.  The defendants have not kept accounts
or records of these elements;
they have made no attempt to account for themselves and their dealings, even
for the period since 29
October 1990, and they have defeated the exercise of
taking accounts and ascertaining what credits should be allowed against an
occupation
fee.  Exhibit O sets out agreed amounts as totals of expenditure,
but the expenditures are not allocated to times.
<P>

53	     The simple fact that Mr Jack Brown has been in occupation is not of
itself a ground upon which he is liable to pay an occupation
fee.  As an
equitable co-owner his occupation has been lawful and he would not ordinarily
incur any obligation to another co-owner.
 <b><i>Forgeard v. Shanahan</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20335%20NSWLR%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 335 NSWLR 206</a> shows that liability of a co-owner to pay an occupation
fee would arise only if there had been some wrongful exclusion of the claiming
co-owner from occupation.  In the last years of her life Mrs Brown lived in a
nursing home and was unable to occupy the premises
and there could be no claim
in respect of the period from 29 April 1987 until 29 August 1990.. I would
think that entitlement to
an occupation fee would arise only if some event
established the plaintiffs' entitlement to sale of the property and
distribution
of the proceeds.  
<P>

54	     Mrs Alice Brown claimed the sale of the property by trustees under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66G</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></i> in her Summons and her daughters have
always maintained this claim since her death.  No express terms place the
trustees under any
active duties and the circumstances of the time of the
acquisition of the house show that while Mrs Alice Brown was alive all that
was
then required of the trustees was to hold the property available for occupation
by the beneficial owners as their home.  Mrs
Alice Brown's claim for sale was a
turning point in trust affairs.  It was not in Mrs Brown's power as one
beneficiary whose interests
were outweighed by those of the trustees to compel
sale of the property; but her claim under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66G</a>, although dependent on a
discretionary decision of the Court, was so strong, in the absence of any
circumstances which could ground
resistance to an order for sale, that it was
no longer appropriate for the trustees to use the trust property as a home for
one of
them and for Mr Jack Brown to continue to occupy the premises rather
than to sell the property and distribute the proceedings. The
death of Mrs
Brown and the end of any possibility of occupation by her marks a further
distinct turning point.  By the date of my
order of 29 October 1990 Mrs Alice
Brown had left the premises because she was in need of care and could not live
in them, she had
brought proceedings claiming an order for sale by trustees,
she had died and it was established by the Court's order that the resulting
trust existed. The accumulation of events produced the result that with fair
certainty, trust affairs had to be wound-up and the
property had to be sold.
In my opinion from that time onwards resistance to a claim for sale by trustees
was no longer reasonable.
 Mr Jack Brown continued to occupy the house and did
not concede the obviously appropriate course of selling it.  Trust affairs
ought
to be administered on the basis that he should pay a reasonable
occupation fee to the trust in respect of his occupation, or should
pay the
appropriate proportion of the occupation fee to the plaintiffs.  So that trust
affairs will be administered on the basis
that what ought to have been done
should be deemed to have been done, the occupation fee should be calculated by
reference to the
rental value from time to time. 
<P>

55	     There were no express arrangements by the contributors declaring the
existence of a trust or establishing the purposes of
the trust or their
intentions.  The contributors purchased a house in which the family was to
live, Mrs Alice Brown applied the proceeds
of the sale of the previous family
home to the purchase, and the family, including Mrs Alice Brown then lived in
the house for some
decades.  These circumstances show that the contributors
acted in the contemplation that the house would be used as a family home
for
all the contributors and their families, and the purpose contemplated was
completely exhausted when it became impossible for
Mrs Alice Brown to live in
the house because she needed to live in a nursing home, or if not then, when
she died.  There is nothing
to indicate that the parties considered what was to
happen when one of the contributors died or became unable to share in the use
of the house.
<P>

56	     These circumstances constitute a very strong case for making an order
under subs 66G(4) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act, 1919</a>.  The Court has a discretion to
refuse such an order, and does so if there is a ground of sufficient substance
for refusing to enable
the applicant to realise proceeds of his co-ownership.
The discretion is established by the decisions in <b><i>Ngatoa v Ford</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 172 (Needham</a> J) and <b><i>Williams v Legg</i></b> (1993) 23
NSWLR 687 (Court of Appeal); see further discussion in <b><i>Forgeard v
Shanahan</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 206</a> at 219-220 (Mahoney JA) and Kirby P
(dissenting) at 212-214.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66G</a> extends to co-ownership under trusts,
even trusts with powers of sale; see Re <b><i>Cordingley
</i></b>(<i>deceased<b>) </b></i>(1948) 48 SR 248.  There are in my opinion
strong grounds favouring a discretionary decision to order sale: the purposes
contemplated
at the time of acquisition became impossible to achieve almost
twelve years ago, Mrs Alice Brown died in 1990, there has been a long
deadlock
during which no tangible advantage whatever has been available to Mrs Alice
Brown or to those interested in her Estate and
the defendants are using the
property solely for the advantage of one of them and have expressed no
intention and shown no sign of
doing anything that would recognise the Estate's
interest.  Unless the Court orders a sale the plaintiffs will not achieve any
practical
recognition of the Estate's right.  Against this can only be put the
inconvenience to Mr Jack Brown and his family of leaving the
home which they
have long occupied, which is not a prominent consideration in view of the
limits of his beneficial interest in the
property.  He can take his place among
the prospective purchasers.
<P>

57	      I propose to make orders appointing trustees for sale and to appoint
the persons whose suitability has been established
by evidence read by the
plaintiffs; their suitability for appointment has not been disputed.
<P>

58	    In my opinion an equitable adjustment of interests in the trust property
requires that the defendants be treated as if they
were accountable to the
trust for the rental value of Lot 100 from 29 October 1990, when the Court
declared that the property was
held on trust for the persons interested in Mrs
Brown's  Estate; or possibly from 29 August 1990 when she died.  With those
events
it became completely clear that the purposes contemplated when the trust
property was acquired had come to an end, and a new turn
in administering the
trust had to be made to recognise the interest of Mrs Alice Brown's Estate.  In
no form whatever did the defendants
make use of No. 118 Morrison Road or any
advantage relating to it available to the plaintiffs.  Even when the defendants
attended
at the house to collect moveable property belonging to Mrs Alice
Brown's Estate their task was not facilitated and difficulties were
made.  At
no time since have the defendants taken any step which would in a tangible way
recognise the minority interest or accord
value to it, and they have employed
the property wholly for the benefit of Mr Jack Brown and his family.  This has
been a highly
partisan application of the trust property, in no way even-handed
among the persons interested. The only fair and equitable adjustment
for the
occupation of the property by one of the trustees is that the trustees should
account as if they had made a fair charge in
the nature of rent to Mr Jack
Brown for his occupation, and they should pay the Estate a proportion of that
charge.
<P>

59	     The amount of rent, taking the fair market rental value of the
property, is established at $86,910 for the period 29 October
1990 to 29
January 1997 by paragraph 8 of Mr Phippen's affidavit of 30 January 1997; this
evidence was not challenged.  I propose
to adopt $300 per week, the last rate
supported by Mr Phippen's evidence for the period from 30 January 1997 to the
28 April 1999,
that is 67 weeks at $300 which equals $20,100.  The total rent
to be allowed is $107,010.  Exhibit O shows that the agreed outgoings
incurred
by the defendants in respect of Lot 100 total $12,935.  The defendants are
accountable to the trust for the balance of $94,075
and my judgment will
include $41,648 for their liability to the plaintiffs; $41,648 is 2125 parts in
4800 parts of that balance.
 
<P>

60	   The proportion of the net proceeds of sale of $654,300 attributable to
Lot 101 is:
<P>

	Value of Lot 101   Value of both Lots  x  $654,300
<P>

	
<P>

	245,000    545,000  x  $654,300   =   $294,134.80
<P>

	
<P>

	The proportion of the proceeds attributable to Lot 101 for which the
defendants are accountable to Mrs Alice Brown's Estate is
$294,134.80  x
2,125    4800  =  $130,216
<P>

61	      On interest see <b><i>Hagan v. Waterhouse</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2034%20NSWLR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 34 NSWLR 308</a>
at 391-393 and <b><i>Pateman v. Heyen</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=33%20NSWLR%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">33 NSWLR 188</a> at 200.  It is no
longer regarded as appropriate to employ low rates of interest in granting
remedies against trustees.  I see no
substantial difference between the
defendants' liability to account for proceeds of sale of Lot 101 and a judgment
debt, in respect
of the period since 29 October 1990.
<P>

62	     The defendants did not set aside any fund as the proceeds of Lot 101,
separate from money of their own:  as trustees should
have done.  They set
aside moneys only to comply with their <b><i>Mareva</i></b> undertaking:  and
the funds set aside do not represent their view of how much money was
applicable to Lot 101.  At no stage did they
take an identifiable position that
any particular sum, or that any particular fund was the Estate's share and
defend it.  In substance
they defied the plaintiffs to prove anything.  This
was not appropriate conduct for trustees.  They cannot say that their interest
liability should be limited to the rate of interest which has been earnt on
their bank deposits, because they have not designated
their bank deposits as
trust property.  The bank deposits contain money of their own as well as trust
property.  They do not have
an identifiable position about which is which.
They are answerable on their personal liability to account for and pay money,
and
should pay interest accordingly.
<P>

63	   In my opinion the defendants should be ordered to pay interest at the
rate usually allowed under Schedule J of the Rules of
Court on judgment debts
from 29 October 1990 to the date of judgment.  They have in fact held large
sums at interest in banks in
pursuance of undertakings given upon applications
for interlocutory injunctions in the nature of <b><i>Mareva</i></b> relief,
first pending appeal and later pending this Inquiry.  The order of 29 October
1990 was affirmed on appeal and it has been
clear since 1990 that the
defendants were obliged to account for and pay over a large sum to the
plaintiffs, and the parties have
been held in dispute since then on the exact
calculation of the amount; in broad terms, the amount involved could be
discerned and
the defendants could at all times have reduced their interest
loss by calculating an amount for which they were liable on their own
case and
paying it over.  They did no such thing, and their holding the funds subject to
<b><i>Mareva</i></b> relief rather than paying funds over was for their benefit
and at their risk as to interest.  I do not regard the interest which
they
earned on the funds which they set aside to comply with their undertaking as
establishing the interest which the plaintiffs
ought to recover.  The
plaintiffs in claiming interest are not materially different to any other
claimant who recovers interlocutory
judgment and is later awarded interest
after the amount is established by assessment or inquiry.  Accordingly I will
award interest
at Schedule J rates on $130,216 from 29 October 1990 to the date
of this judgment.
<P>

64	     Interest calculations on $130,216 from 29 October 1990 to 29 April 1999
are as follows:
<P>

29.10.90  to  28.2.91 :  123 days at 19%			8337.39

<P>

<P>

65	     I will also award interest on the amount of the defendants' liability
for the charge in the nature of rent.  Interest cannot
be assessed on any
precise basis and approximations must be adopted.  My method is to reckon
interest as if two-seventeenths of the
total rent fell due on 29 October 1991
and thenceforward as if part of the rent increasing by two-seventeenths fell
due on 29 October
each year until 1998:  I will use the rates in Schedule J.
