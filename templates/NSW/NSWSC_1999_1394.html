<u>REGINA   v   Craig LAING</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>60643/95<b></b><p>
<b></b>Thursday, 20 June 1996<b></b><p>
<b></b>COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL<b></b><p>
<b></b>PRIESTLEY JA,  ABADEE J,  LEVINE J<p>
<p>
RESULT:<b>	</b>Application for leave to appeal allowed; appeal allowed;
judgment and verdict of acquittal entered.<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>PRIESTLEY JA:</b> The appellant and his father, Warren John Laing, were
tried on an indictment charging that they<p>
<p>
"<i>between 1 August 1992 and 23 June 1993, at Rugby ... New South Wales, did
knowingly take part in the cultivation of not less than
the commercial quantity
of a prohibited plant, to wit, 440 cannabis plants.</i>"<p>
	On 22 September 1995 a District Court jury found both men guilty. The trial
judge was his Honour Judge Luland QC. He convicted the
appellant and his
father. On 27 October 1995 he sentenced the appellant to a minimum term of two
years imprisonment to commence on
22 September 1995 and to expire on 21
September 1997 and an additional term of two years to commence on 22 September
1997 and to
expire on 21 September 1999. He sentenced the father to a slightly
longer term. The father did not appeal against conviction, but
did apply for
leave to appeal against sentence. That application was heard by the Bench in
the present appeal, immediately before
the hearing of the present appeal.
Judgment in the father's application was reserved until the conclusion of the
present appeal.<p>
	The Crown case against the appellant was a circumstantial one. The one ground
of his appeal against conviction was that the jury's
verdict was unsafe and
unsatisfactory. In the circumstances of the present case, that meant the
appellant's submission was to the
effect that "<i>(a) reasonable jury ought to
have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open
on the evidence</i>" (the words come from <i>Knight v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175
CLR 479</a> at 503). <p>
	At the trial there were a number of matters which were not in dispute. On 23
June 1993 police executed a search warrant at a property
near Rugby, which is
not far from Crookwell. This property had been bought by Mr Warren Laing in May
1990 and transferred to the
appellant on 17 June 1991 for one dollar. Mr Warren
Laing and his wife remained in occupation until early 1993, in Mr Laing's case
until 8 March 1993. There was no-one present at the homestead on the property
on 23 June 1993. The police forced entry and in the
homestead found pieces of
cannabis leaf on the floor, two brown paper bags containing cannabis seeds and
strings hanging from ceiling
beams for the hanging and drying of cannabis leaf.
In a bedroom a book called "<i>Marijuana Grower's Guide</i>" was found. It was
a book of 330 pages. A fingerprint of the appellant was found on three of the
pages in positions indicating, according
to the expert witness, that the finger
was not being used in the way a reader uses a finger to hold or turn a page. A
fourth fingerprint
was found on the book which was not that of either the
appellant or his father. In outbuildings traces of cannabis leaf as well as
fertiliser and plant hormone were found. The property was described as "<i>very
large</i>" and as being very poor agricultural land. <p>
	Police searching the property came to a creek from which a diesel pump was
connected to pipelines leading to six areas where cannabis
plants had been
harvested. 440 plant stems and root systems were counted. These areas were
capable of irrigation by a sprinkler system
fed from the pipelines from the
creek.<p>
	The evidence at the trial was such that the jury were bound to find that the
Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that part
of the indictment which
alleged that not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited plant, to
wit, 440 cannabis plants, had
been cultivated on the property. <p>
	The real issues in the trial were whether the Crown had proved beyond
reasonable doubt that (i) Mr Warren Laing and (ii) the appellant
had knowingly
taken part in that cultivation.<p>
	On 23 June 1993 police had executed another search warrant at the appellant's
home at Toukley. It is not clear whether he was then
arrested on the
cultivation charge the subject of this appeal. The court was not referred to
any evidence of his having had any conversation
with any police officers on
this occasion. What does appear is that on 11 August 1993 a detective met the
appellant by arrangement
at Goulburn Police Station. He had a solicitor with
him who advised him not to answer any questions. He took that advice. It
appears
that he did not at any stage make any statement to the police. <p>
	At the trial, he made an unsworn statement. In the course of this statement he
said some things about which there is apparently
no issue. He had been living
at Toukley, about six hours drive from the property at Rugby at all relevant
times. He had been renovating
his own home during the period in which, on the
Crown case, the cannabis plants were being cultivated. He said that he had
helped
his father in 1990 and 1991 to pull down some old houses at the Rugby
property and then up until about 1992 building the house which
had been
searched by the police. <p>
	Other parts of his statement which must not have been accepted by the jury
were that he had spent no time at the Rugby property
in 1993, except for 16
March 1993, when he drove his mother there to pick up some belongings and took
her back to Campbelltown where
she was then living and then went further on
back to his own home at Toukley, all on the same day. He said he had no
knowledge of
the crop or any knowledge of anyone doing anything to the crop. He
produced a number of receipts which later went into evidence showing
the
purchase of building materials in late 1992 and the first half of 1993 for the
renovation of his Toukley house. He added that
after his last child was born in
April 1992, apart from the 16 March 1993 visit, he had only been to the
property on two or three
occasions, each time with his wife and children.<p>
	In his summing-up to the jury, the trial judge said that the Crown case
against the appellant was that the appellant actively participated
in the
cultivation of the crop. He said the Crown sought to establish this case as
follows.<p>
	First, a connection was shown between the property and the appellant by his
ownership of it; next the Crown relied on the fact that
the property had been
"<i>secured</i>". That is, there was evidence that the entrance to the property
was padlocked and that the house was locked. This state of affairs
was an
indication that the persons who had access to the house, and there was no
dispute but that this included the appellant, must
have had an involvement with
the cultivation. There was also evidence of dogs within the property, which
made visitors apprehensive;
next the Crown relied on evidence said to show that
the house had been lived in either at or shortly before the time of the search.
Then it was argued that evidence showed that the appellant had been in the area
at relevant times. In particular the evidence of
the owner of a hardware store
at Crookwell was relied on; finally, the Crown relied on the fingerprints on
the "<i>Marijuana Grower's Guide</i>" as showing a connection between the
appellant and marijuana.<p>
	In the course of the summing-up, after the trial judge had put the Crown's
case against the appellant to the jury on the basis I
have summarised, there
was an interruption in which some discussion took place between his Honour and
counsel about the way the case
was being left to the jury. The Crown raised no
question with the trial judge about the way he had so far summarised the
Crown's
case against the appellant. His Honour then noted that the Crown case
"<i>is clearly that it is these two that were involved in the cultivation and
you are relying upon those facts I have put to them and
that is it</i>". He
added that it was the defence case there may have been access to the property
by others who "<i>may have been responsible for the cultivation and that these
two had nothing to do with it at all</i>". <p>
	The importance of these observations is that no doubt was left that the Crown
was asking the jury to accept as proved beyond reasonable
doubt actual
participation in the cultivation (as distinct from the harvesting) of the crop.
His Honour's way of stating what the
accused were saying was adequate for the
purpose he had in hand at the time when he was making the observation, but it
would be more
accurate to say that each accused was saying that he had had
nothing to do with the cultivation. In particular so far as concerns
the
appellant, he said nothing about his father one way or the other; he was saying
simply he had had nothing to do with the cultivation
and knew nothing about
it.<p>
	The case against the father was clearly stronger than that against the
appellant, in that it would have been open to the jury to
accept that it was
during the father's actual occupancy of the property (which was undisputed)
that at least some part of the cultivation
must have been going on. In regard
to the appellant however, taking the evidence at its highest against him, the
connection between
him and the property (in the sense of his being there) was
much more shadowy. The only firm evidence of his being in the area at
times
that may have been relevant to cultivation was consistent with what he said
about the limited number of occasions he visited
the property.<p>
	The evidence given by the hardware store proprietor at Crookwell which appears
to have been relied on heavily by the Crown, as it
was in the argument before
us, when the whole of it is looked at, does not seem to me to be of any
particular assistance to the Crown.
In his evidence in chief, the witness said
that he had sold some goods in the second half of 1992 to the appellant which
the jury
would have been entitled to think were to be used in constructing the
irrigation system later found connected to the six planted
areas. However, in
cross-examination his evidence became much vaguer and he eventually agreed that
the date of selling the goods
may have been 1991. This takes the transaction so
far away from the period alleged by the Crown to have been that in which the
irrigation
set up was being constructed (which the Crown was contending was in
the late part of 1992) as to deprive the evidence of most of
its
significance.<p>
	It seems to me, taking the Crown case as it was put against the appellant at
the trial at its highest, and assuming the jury accepted
nothing said by the
appellant or the witnesses called in his case, nevertheless, the Crown case can
not be said to have excluded
the reasonable possibility that, for example, the
appellant's father, in residence on the property, did the cultivation alone,
or,
as he was not physically strong (which to some extent at least appears to
have been common ground at the trial) with the help of
a person or persons
other than the appellant. The various features of the case relied upon by the
Crown are certainly such as to
excite suspicion in a reasonable mind about the
part the appellant may have played in the cultivation of the cannabis crop, but
do
not seem to me to rise to the level of proof that he did so, particularly
when looked at from the circumstantial evidence standpoint,
required by the
law, of asking whether the evidence is consistent with a reasonable possibility
that some person other than the person
charged was responsible for the offence
alleged against him.<p>
	One matter relied upon heavily by the Crown both at the trial and in the
appeal was the presence of a fingerprint of the appellant
on three leaves of
the "<i>Marijuana Grower's Guide</i>". Taken by itself, that evidence
establishes that at some time the appellant handled the book and, probably did
so while at the property.
The evidence thus places the appellant at the
property, something which he in any event did not dispute. Rejection of his
explanation
that he was only there on a very limited number of innocent
occasions, does not supply any evidence as to how often he was there.
<p>
	A further aspect of the evidence about the book is that, besides the
appellant's three fingerprints, it bore one other which was
sufficiently clear
to enable examination of it. The examination showed that it was not a
fingerprint of either the appellant or his
father. It is thus evidence that
some other person was present at the property, which is consistent with the
alternative explanation
which, in the appeal, the appellant relies on as being
one both reasonable and not excluded by the Crown in its case. <p>
	I agree with the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the Crown
case did not justify the jury's verdict against the appellant.
It seems to me
that this is not a case where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the
evidence resolves the doubt that I have
experienced upon a consideration of the
case against the appellant. For my part, having reviewed the Crown case I have
what seems
to me to be a reasonable doubt that the Crown established its case
to the necessary level.<p>
	In the appeal, the Crown forcefully pressed the same features of the case as
those enumerated by the trial judge in his summing-up
as justifying the jury
verdict. Indeed, there was some elaboration and expansion of the features in
ways that do not appear to have
been drawn to the jury's attention. None of
these seems to me however to take the matter any further in regard to the
exclusion of
the reasonable possibility that, for example, someone other than
the appellant helped Mr Warren Laing in cultivation of the cannabis
plants. In
particular, the Crown relied in the appeal on a submission based on Exhibit F,
tendered in the appellant's case at the
trial. This was a form of chronology
listing incidents and items of evidence showing the appellant's continuous
residence in Toukley
and designed to support his unsworn assertion that he had
made the very limited, innocent, visits to the property claimed in his
statement. <p>
	Counsel referred to what were said to be two significant gaps in this
chronology, one from 23 October 1992 to 15 December 1992 and
the other from 23
April 1993 to 2 June 1993. It was then submitted that these gaps could be
related to periods when it was likely
that particular attention was required on
the property to cultivation of the cannabis plants, and that the lack of any
explanation
by the appellant of these gaps was a matter to be taken into
significant account against him. <p>
	Leaving aside the fact that there is no sign I can see in the trial papers of
this matter having been raised in the trial, it does
not seem to me to take the
Crown case any further. The evidence concerning when the plants in question
were likely to have been planted,
and harvested, was very vague. There was no
way the jury could fix any particular date as that of the harvesting. The
evidence probably
supported the conclusion that the whole operation from the
getting of the irrigation system into working order through to the harvesting
of the plants took place between late September 1992 and some unspecified date
before 23 June 1993, but the expert witnesses who
tried to give assistance
about the dating of the events agreed that there were difficulties in being at
all precise within those
outer boundaries. There were other problems with the
precision of their evidence related to the incomplete data they had to work
with in forming their opinions.<p>
	Despite the best efforts of counsel for the Crown in the appeal, I do not
think he has been able to elevate the Crown case against
the appellant from the
level of suspicion to that of the requisite proof. <p>
	My opinion therefore is that the appellant's appeal should be upheld, his
conviction quashed and the jury verdict set aside. The
case is not one in my
opinion appropriate for the ordering of a new trial. A judgment and verdict of
acquittal should be entered.<p>
	When sentencing the appellant Luland DCJ noted that he was then serving a
sentence of two years periodic detention imposed on 21
June 1994 pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pdopa1981332/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
24(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pdopa1981332/" class="autolink_findacts">Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981</a>. He cancelled that order.
His intention was that the balance of that sentence should be subsumed into the
custodial sentence which
he then imposed. <p>
	In view of the fact that the appellant has been in custody since 27 October
1995 and in my opinion there should be no new trial
in regard to the matter the
court is now dealing with, I do not think the appellant should be required to
serve any further portion
of the sentence of two years periodic detention. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ABADEE J:	</b>I agree with the reasons of Priestley JA and the orders that
he proposes.<p>

<b>LEVINE J:	</b>		 I agree with Priestley JA.<p>
