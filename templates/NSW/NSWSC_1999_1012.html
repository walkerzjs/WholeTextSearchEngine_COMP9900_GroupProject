LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	By a Summons issued on 14 May 1999 the plaintiff seeks
damages against the defendant, including damages pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.82</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">87</a> of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> 1974, interest on any award of damages at a
compound rate, and ancillary relief.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff alleges that, at all material times, it
carried on the business of a money lending institution, and that the
defendant,
at all material times, carried on a property valuation and property consultancy
business and represented itself to the
plaintiff as experienced in the area of
property valuations.  It is pleaded that on or about 22 October 1995 the
defendant prepared
a written valuation for the plaintiff, on behalf of Mr and
Mrs Crisp, of a certain property for mortgage security purposes, whereby
it
valued an unencumbered fee simple interest in the property as at that date at
$3.4m.  It is pleaded that in or about November
1995 the defendant caused the
valuation to be forwarded to the plaintiff to be used for its mortgage security
purposes, and that
it thereby made representations to the plaintiff that it had
the necessary skill and expertise to value the property; that a Mr Jelley,
a
director of the defendant, was a registered valuer and had the necessary skill
and expertise to value the property; that the market
value of the property for
the purpose to which I have referred, as at 22 October 1995, was $3.4m; and
that the valuation was suitable
for the plaintiff's mortgage security
purposes.
<P>

3   	It is pleaded nextly that by letter dated 4 December 1995
the defendant "assigned" the valuation to the plaintiff and represented
to it
that the market value at the date to which I have referred was as stated; that
the valuation was prepared for mortgage security
purposes; that the valuation
was suitable to be relied upon by the plaintiff for its mortgage security
purposes; that the plaintiff
was entitled to make a loan secured by a
registered first mortgage on the property in reliance on the valuation; that
the defendant
was responsible to the plaintiff in relation to the content of
the valuation; that Mr Jelley was a registered valuer; and that the
defendant's
professional indemnity insurance covered the valuation.  Certain implied
representations, essentially to the same effect,
are pleaded and, in paragraph
9, it is pleaded that "induced by and acting in reliance on the valuation and
the representations"
the plaintiff advanced $2,383,000.70 to Mr and Mrs Crisp
by a loan agreement dated 4 December 1995, accepted a registered first mortgage
over the property as security for the repayment of the amount lent, and
discharged its mortgage over other property owned by Mr and
Mrs Crisp, which
otherwise would have secured the debt.  
<P>

4   	It is pleaded in paragraph 11 that when preparing,
forwarding and "assigning" the valuation to the plaintiff and making the
representations alleged, the defendant knew or reasonably ought to have known
that the plaintiff was relying upon it to exercise
all due care and skill in
the preparation of the valuation; that the plaintiff would act upon the
valuation when deciding whether
to advance money to Mr and Mrs Crisp and in
determining what security to accept for repayment thereof; that if the
valuation proved
to be inaccurate, unreliable or otherwise negligently prepared
the plaintiff was liable to suffer financial loss and damage; and
that the
plaintiff was in fact advancing money to Mr and Mrs Crisp in reliance on the
valuation.  
<P>

5   	In paragraph 12 it is pleaded that the valuation was
prepared by the defendant and "assigned" to the plaintiff negligently
in a
number of ways particularised.
<P>

6   	It is then pleaded that the representations were made by
the defendant in trade or commerce, and that in contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> they were misleading or deceptive and/or likely to
mislead or deceive.
<P>

7   	The contentions conclude by pleading that Mr and Mrs Crisp
defaulted under the loan agreement on 5 May 1998; that they had
not repaid the
amount owing; that the property is unlikely to achieve a price "anywhere in the
vicinity of $3.4m"; and that its market
value as at 22 October 1995 was
$775,000.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff then pleads the institution of proceedings by
it against Mr and Mrs Crisp in this Court, and that had the defendant
not
prepared the valuation negligently and made the representations then the
plaintiff would not have advanced any money to Mr and
Mrs Crisp and, further or
in the alternative, it would not have advanced the amount it did to them,
accepted a mortgage over the
property as security for the repayment of it, and
discharged its mortgage over the other property.
<P>

9   	In the circumstances it is alleged that by reason of the
defendant's negligence and breaches of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> the plaintiff has suffered and will
continue to suffer loss.
<P>

10   	By its Notice of Grounds of Defence the defendant,
relevantly for present purposes, admits that it prepared the valuation
as
alleged and that the valuation was prepared on behalf of Mr and Mrs Crisp for
use in connection with one or more proposed finance
applications, but otherwise
denies the matters pleaded in paragraph 5.   The defendant denies that it
caused the valuation to be
forwarded to the plaintiff, but admits that by
letter dated 4 December 1995 it informed the plaintiff that it would extend its
responsibility
in connection with the contents of the valuation to it.  It
further admits that it represented to the plaintiff that Mr Jelley held
the
professional opinion that, based upon the methodology, assumptions,
qualifications and recommendations contained in the valuation,
a reasonable
assessment of the value of the property as at 22 October 1995 was $3.4m.  The
defendant also admits that it represented
that the valuation was suitable to be
relied upon by the plaintiff for its mortgage security purposes; that it
acknowledged that
Ingwersen and Lansdown, solicitors, and the plaintiff,
intended to make a loan in reliance on the valuation secured by registered
first mortgage; and that it represented that Mr Jelley was a registered valuer
and that the defendant's professional indemnity insurance
covered the
valuation.  The defendant also admits that it represented that Mr Jelley held
the professional opinion to which I have
referred.
<P>

11   	In paragraph 11 the defendant admits that it knew that the
plaintiff was contemplating advancing funds on the security of
the mortgage
over the property; that it may rely upon the valuation in connection with the
proposed loan; and that in the event that
the plaintiff acted in reliance on
the valuation and it proved to be inaccurate, unreliable or otherwise
negligently prepared, the
plaintiff was liable to suffer financial loss and
damage.
<P>

12   	The matters relating to damage are put in issue,
essentially on the basis that there is a denial that the market value of
the
property, as at 22 October 1995, was $775,000, and, as subsequently emerged,
that there were other factors affecting the value
of the property.
<P>

13   	In answer to the whole of the Summons the defendant says
that if the plaintiff suffered loss or damage, which the defendant
denies, it
was caused or contributed to by the plaintiff's negligence in that it failed to
make any adequate investigation and/or
analysis of the creditworthiness of the
borrowers; failed to carry out any adequate assessment of the borrowers'
capacity to service
the loan; and failed to identify and assess or adequately
assess the risks involved in the loan and, in particular the risks involved
by
reason of the scale of the proposed subdivision, the time required to complete
it, the time required to market and sell the lots
created by it, the re-zoning
of the property, and the absence of local Council consent to the proposed
subdivision.
<P>

14   	It is further pleaded that the plaintiff failed to carry
out any adequate assessment of the borrowers' ability to repay the
principal
sum when it fell due or of the viability of the proposed subdivision, and
advanced funds for the purpose of road construction
without first obtaining
professional confirmation of construction cost and without any adequate
confirmation or assurance that works
had been or would be completed, or that
the roads would be vested as public roads within the meaning of the <b>Roads
Act</b> 1993.
<P>

15   	It is pleaded that the plaintiff failed to obtain any
adequate confirmation or assurance in relation to a certain lot in the
proposed
subdivision; failed to ensure that the borrowers proceeded with the proposed
subdivision of that lot within an appropriate
time frame; failed to have regard
to the zoning details referred to in a s.149 certificate issued and provided to
Ingerswen and Lansdown
on 21 November 1995; failed to have regard to the zoning
information contained in the borrowers' loan application; failed to obtain
any
or any adequate confirmation or assurance that those parts of the property
which required rezoning to permit the proposed subdivision
or development would
be rezoned within an appropriate time frame; failed to obtain further security
or, alternatively, further security
in substitution for the mortgage over the
second property; failed to make any adequate investigations and/or analysis of
the creditworthiness
of the borrowers and/or a change in their position from
the date of the loan; extended the time for repayment of the loan on 4 December
1996 and/or 4 December 1997 without obtaining an up-to-date valuation of the
property or obtaining any or any adequate confirmation
of the progress made by
the borrowers in developing the property or making any or any adequate
investigations as to whether there
had been any rezoning of the property, or
obtaining any or any adequate confirmation that the borrowers were proceeding
with the
proposed development or subdivision within an appropriate time frame;
or carrying out any or any adequate investigation or analysis
of the
creditworthiness of the borrowers and/or their ability to service and/or repay
the loan.
<P>

<b>The Present Notice Of Motion</b>
<P>

16   	By a Notice of Motion filed on 3 September 1999 the
defendant sought leave to issue a cross-claim in the form attached thereto.
This application was opposed.  The proposed cross-claim seeks indemnity or
contribution in respect of any damages recovered against
the defendant by the
plaintiff, the nature of the dispute being stated as a claim for indemnity or
contribution in respect of any
damages recovered by the plaintiff against the
defendant; whether there was breach of statutory and tortious duties owed to
the plaintiff
by its directors and officers; and whether there was negligence
by a firm of solicitors, Ingerswen and Lansdown, in the performance
of legal
services and mortgage management services provided to the plaintiff.
<P>

17   	The cross-claim pleads that, at all material times, the
plaintiff carried on business as a lender and the manager of funds
paid to
Ingerswen and Lansdown by persons wishing to make loans secured by first
mortgages over real property, and as a trustee of
those funds and of securities
given in respect of advances of those funds.
<P>

18   	It is pleaded that, at all material times, the first
cross-defendant was an officer of the plaintiff and involved in the day
to day
management and conduct of its affairs and business and, that at all material
times since 14 September 1996, he was a director
of it.  It is pleaded that at
all material times each of the second to fifth cross-defendants was a director
and officer of the plaintiff
involved in the day to day management of its
affairs and conduct of its business and that by reason of the matters pleaded
the cross-defendants
owed a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that it did not act
negligently or in breach of trust in connection with its dealings with
the
contributors or its management of or dealings with their funds.  Particulars
are given of s.232(4) of the <b>Corporations Law</b> "and the common law and in
equity".
<P>

19   	It is pleaded that the loan was made, but in breach of the
duty the first cross-defendant failed to exercise reasonable care,
skill and
diligence in facilitating and/or participating in the approval of the finance
application and the advancing of the contributors'
funds to the borrowers.  
<P>

20   	Thereafter a number of  particulars of negligence are
pleaded, many of which reflect or are similar to those alleged in the
allegations of contributory negligence.
<P>

21   	There is an alternative pleading that at all material
times the second to fifth cross-defendants, and at all material times
since 1
July 1996, the first cross-defendant, carried on their profession as solicitors
under the name Ingerswen &amp; Lansdown and
were retained by the plaintiff to
provide services in connection with the finance application of Mr and Mrs Crisp
and mortgage management
services, including analysis of the loan application
and the making of recommendations to the plaintiff, and acting on its behalf
in
its capacity as lender in the loan transaction.  It is pleaded that the
cross-defendants knew or ought to have known that the
plaintiff would rely upon
them to properly and carefully perform the legal services and that if this were
not done the plaintiff
may suffer loss or damage.  It is pleaded that in
reliance upon the legal and mortgage management services, the plaintiff
advanced
the said sum to the borrowers, accepted a registered first mortgage
over the property as security for its repayment, agreed to and
did discharge
its mortgage over another property, and rolled over the loan for the further
periods of twelve months on 4 December
1996 and 4 December 1997.  It is pleaded
that in doing so the cross-defendants were negligent in a number of respects,
essentially,
once again, reflecting the general nature of the way in which the
negligence had been pleaded previously.
<P>

22   	It is pleaded that if the defendant was negligent in the
manner alleged in the contentions, which is denied, and if the plaintiff
suffered loss and damage as a consequence of that negligence, which is also
denied, then the cross-defendants are tortfeasors liable
in respect of the same
damage within the meaning of s.5 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act</a></b> 1946; and, further and in the alternative, if the defendant
engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of s.52, which
is denied,
and if the plaintiff suffered loss and damage in consequence thereof, which is
denied, then by reason of the matters pleaded
in the proposed cross-claim the
cross-defendants are, or would if sued, be joint tortfeasors and/or have a
co-ordinate liability
to compensate the plaintiff in respect of the same
loss.
<P>

23   	The defendant, as cross-claimant, claims indemnity or
contribution in respect of any damages recovered against it by the plaintiff,
costs and ancillary orders.
<P>

<b>The Provisions Of The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946</a></b>
<P>

24   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5(1)(c)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act</a></b> 1946 provides:-
<P>

<b>"5(1)	Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether
a crime or not):</b>
<P>

<b>.......</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution
from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have
been, liable in respect
of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so, however,
that no person shall be entitled
to recover contribution under this section
from any person entitled to be indemnified by that person in respect of the
liability
in respect of which the contribution is sought."</b>
<P>

<b>The Case As Propounded </b>
<P>

25   	The plaintiff's case, accordingly, is that it obtained a
valuation on the faith of which and of the various representations
it has
pleaded it lent money to Mr and Mrs Crisp on the security of the valued
property, (and gave up other security), but that the
valuation was excessive as
a consequence of wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant and as a result
of which the plaintiff
has sustained loss.  The defendant's initial response to
these allegations is that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.
The plaintiff was a company through which money, at least so far as the
pleading discloses, provided by clients of Ingerswen &amp;
Lansdown, was
amalgamated and lent.  The partners in that firm were directors of the
plaintiff and, as such, owed duties to it. 
The firm also acted for the
plaintiff in the lending transaction, so that the partners owed duties to the
plaintiff acting in that
capacity.  In these circumstances the acts of the
proposed cross-defendants in their roles as directors and solicitors will have
to be investigated.  
<P>

26   	It may well be, although one can see the potential
complications in this, that the plaintiff wishes to cross-claim against
the
proposed cross-defendants, either in their role as directors of it or, perhaps
more logically, as its solicitors.  Indeed, in
the course of submissions,
attention was drawn to the possibility that the cross-defendants may have to be
represented separately
from the plaintiff.  However, these complications are
not of the defendant's making.  They arise from the way in which the plaintiff
has been administered and its decision to use as its solicitors the firm of
which its directors are partners.  This is not intended
to be critical of the
plaintiff, its directors or solicitors, but merely to emphasise how, at least
to a large extent, the present
problem has arisen.
<P>

27   	The defendant's claim that the plaintiff has been guilty
of contributory negligence, if made out, entitles the defendant to
have the
damages to which the plaintiff otherwise would be entitled reduced "to such
extent as the Court thinks just and equitable
having regard to the claimant's
share in the responsibility for the damage": <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act</a> </b>1965, s.10(1).
<P>

<b>The Submissions For The Proposed Cross-Defendants</b>
<P>

28   	It was submitted that the Court would not, as a matter of
law, order contribution against the proposed cross-defendants, firstly,
because
the defendant must establish that such contribution is "just and equitable":
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a></b> 1946, "having
regard to the extent to that person's responsibility for the damage".  Thus, so
the submission ran, there is an entitlement
to have the damages against the
plaintiff reduced in so far as that is "just and equitable" having regard to
the conduct of the plaintiff,
but there cannot be a right to contribution from
a third party where the damages have been so reduced.
<P>

29   	Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Court of
Appeal in <b>Daniels &amp; Ors v Anderson &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 438.</a>
It was submitted that that decision is authority for the proposition that
contribution against officers and agents of the plaintiff
will not be ordered
where there is an existing claim against the company for contributory
negligence, as it is not "just and equitable"
to reduce the defendant's damage
twice in relation to the same negligence.
<P>

30   	At p.589 Clarke and Sheller JJA said:-
<P>

<b>"Mr McAlary submitted that the Court should not apply this approach but
should disregard the contributory negligence finding in assessing
appropriate
contribution.  Any injustice which flowed from the determination could be dealt
with at the stage when Deloitte Haskins
&amp; Sells sought execution of the
judgment.  Although it is not entirely clear, we understood him to be saying
that there should
be a permanent stay of execution.</b>
<P>

<b>In our opinion there is nothing in favour of this solution of the problem.
How could it be `just and equitable' to make an award and
then permanently stay
its effect.  We consider that the answer proffered by Dr Williams and Jackson J
offers the only practical solution
although we acknowledge that its effect is
to enable the party against whom it is found that he would, if sued, have been
liable
to AWA to leave the arena virtually unscathed.</b>
<P>

<b>We are also aware that it is possible to conjure up complex fact situations
in which Dr Williams' solutions may not provide the answer.
 For instance if
AWA had sued Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Hooke, and each had cross-claimed
against the other, there would be
obvious difficulties which may not be capable
of resolution by recourse to the approach advocated by Dr Williams.  </b>
<P>

<b>We are not, however, concerned with hypothetical situations but in
endeavouring to provide the satisfactory solution to the present
problem.
Where, as in the present circumstances, a party has secured partial relief, by
way of a finding of contributory negligence
it would not, in our opinion, be
just and equitable that it obtain an award for any compensation.  If it were
otherwise it would
unjustly receive double compensation."</b>
<P>

At pp.579-580 their Honours set out the view of Dr Glanville Williams, and the
application of that principle in the two authorities
to which they referred.
<P>

31   	In my opinion, application of these principles, as I think
their Honours were saying, must await the ultimate factual determination.
 I
think it is clear from the penultimate paragraph of their Honour's reasons that
that determination requires a consideration of
the particular "circumstances"
of each case.  They can only be assessed at the end of the evidence and when
conclusions are made
on the respective claims.  There can be no doubt that that
assessment may lead to the result suggested by their Honours, and the
Court,
obviously enough, cannot allow a defendant to "double dip".  But I am not
satisfied that that is an issue to be determined
in advance of a resolution of
the case.  Rather, in my opinion, it is a matter to be adjudicated upon in the
final determination
of it, and it does not provide a basis for holding that to
allow a cross-claim raising these issues is impermissible, such that the
Court
should either not permit the cross-claim to be filed or, if the defendant is
entitled as of right to do so, it should not strike
it out as futile.
<P>

32   	Mr G.A. Sirtes of Counsel, who appeared for the plaintiff
and the proposed cross-defendants, analysed the acts of contributory
negligence
and negligence allegedly entitling the defendant to contribution.  He submitted
that that analysis showed that they were
essentially the same and, accordingly,
that the decision of the Court of Appeal rendered the proposed cross-claim
futile.  For the
reasons I have sought to give, I do not consider this is so.
It may be, of course, that when all the facts are known it will be held
that
contribution is not appropriate.  However, that is a very different thing from
saying that a party is not entitled to have the
factual issues explored for the
purpose of determining the ultimate legal issues and, in my opinion, the
defendant, as cross-claimant,
does have that entitlement.
<P>

33   	It was nextly submitted that the claim made by the
defendant against the proposed cross-defendants was in respect of the different
capacities in which the proposed cross-defendants acted, namely as directors
and as solicitors, although it was submitted that this
was "a distinction
without a difference" because the proposed cross-claim ascribes the same acts
and conduct towards both as constituting
the ground for contribution.  The
submission continued:-
<P>

<b>"The proposed cross-defendants acted on behalf of the company and in my
submission it would not be possible to arbitrarily allocate
the same acts
performed by the same people to different roles.  The conduct, performed in
dual capacities, must be imputed to the
company."</b>
<P>

34   	The submission continued that it would be "an act of
artificiality" for the Court to attempt to differentiate between the
acts of
the five proposed cross-defendants in their capacities as directors and
solicitors in seeking to apportion damages, and that
it is "unlikely" that the
Court could find them responsible in negligence as solicitors, but not in their
capacity as directors.
 Mr Sirtes also stated that the plaintiff had made a
written concession that it made no attempt to disavow the acts of its agents,
whether they were directors or solicitors.  This concession was apparently made
without any prompting from the defendant and it was
not one accepted
unequivocally by the defendant, nor was it one the full legal implications of
which are clear.  It seems to me that
the precise effect of any such concession
should be gauged in the light of the way in which any such concession is
pleaded by way
of a reply to the defendant's defence or a defence to the
cross-claim.  It may also be, and I am not expressing any final view about
this, that the contributors would wish to have this issue further delineated
and defined, because if, for some reason, any damage
suffered by the plaintiff
is found to be irrecoverable against the defendant in consequence of the
conduct of the proposed cross-defendants,
the contributors may wish to assert,
depending upon their precise relationship with the plaintiff, the
cross-defendants in their
role as directors, and the cross-defendants in their
role as solicitors, that in so far as the plaintiff is unable to recover from
the defendant the full amount it seeks, the contributors are, in some way,
entitled to recover from the proposed cross-defendants
in one or both of their
capacities.
<P>

35   	The next submission was that the defendant seeks
contribution against the proposed cross-defendants in relation to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a></b> claim raised by the plaintiff, and that the defendant is not
entitled to claim contribution under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a> in respect of that cause of action.
Firstly, it was submitted, that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a> is concerned with tortfeasors, and that a
party in breach of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> is not a tortfeasor:
<b>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Turnbull and Partners
Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/618.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 618</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20106%20ALR%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 106 ALR 115</a> and <b>Bailkower v Acohs Pty Limited &amp;
Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20154%20ALR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 154 ALR 534.</a>  
<P>

It was not contended that these cases were not authority for that
proposition.
<P>

36   	However, in <b>Bailkower</b> the Full Court of the Federal
Court said, at p.544:-
<P>

<b>"Section 5 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a></i> is not
directly relevant in the present case.  However, notwithstanding the view of Mr
Campbell QC which appealed to Cooper J in
<i>Dorrough</i>, we are inclined to
the view that Sheppard J was correct when he said in <i>Turnbull</i> that the
cause of action under s.82 for breach of s.52 of the Act is entirely statutory
and not an action in tort.  It is true that
actions based on s.52 are analogous
to actions in tort, and that because of this the rules for assessing damages in
tort, rather
than those for assessing damages in contract, are the appropriate
guide for assessments under s.82 ..  but the cause of action is
created by the
statute.  Unlike the tort of breach of statutory duty, the common law plays no
part in the creation of the cause of
action.  However, since <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a> does not apply
in the present case, we need not decide that point."</b>
<P>

Therefore, whilst it is apparent that the Full Court favoured the view in
<b>Turnbull</b>, it is by no means apparent from their decision that, after
full consideration, they would have followed it.
<P>

37   	The matter was also considered, in the context of
statutory claims under the <b>Corporations Law</b>, by Cooper J in <b>South
Cross Airlines Holdings Limited v Arthur Andersen &amp; Co &amp; Ors</b> (1998)
280 FCA (27 March 1998).  Whilst I think it correct to say that his Honour's
view would have supported the view for which
Mr Sirtes has contended I do not
consider that when one has regard to <b>Bailkower</b> and that decision that
the matter has been so clearly determined that I should strike out that part of
the cross-claim.  That is
particularly so having regard to the decision, and
the reasoning underpinning it, in <b>Wickstead &amp; Ors v Browne</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30
NSWLR 1.</a>  The High Court, in granting special leave to appeal, also upheld the
appeal.
<P>

38   	As I consider that the balance of the cross-claim should
be allowed to go forward, I am not prepared to disallow this part
of it.  The
matter can be determined, along with the other issues, at the hearing.
<P>

39   	Finally it was submitted that the proposed cross-claim
failed to address the issue of knowledge, which it was submitted is
the
cornerstone of liability in a director's negligence case.  The submission
continued that the plaintiff may have done or failed
to do a number of things
causing or contributing to the loss claimed against the defendant, that these
matters cannot constitute
negligence by the directors unless they are matters
of which, in the performance of their duties, they were or should have been
aware.
<P>

40   	The proposed cross-claim alleges that each of the proposed
cross-defendants was involved in the day to day management of the
affairs and
conduct of the business of the plaintiff, and the particulars of negligence
allege, essentially, failures by them, in
their roles as directors, to do
various things, the obvious inference from the pleading being that these were
matters to which directors
should have attended.  In so far as it is necessary
for there to be an allegation of knowledge, I think this is a sufficient
pleading
of it.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

41   	In the result I am of the view that the defendant should
have leave to issue the cross-claim in the form attached to its Notice
of
Motion filed on 3 September 1999.  I make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of
that Notice of Motion and I order the cross-defendants
to pay the
cross-claimant's costs of the Notice of Motion. 
<P>
