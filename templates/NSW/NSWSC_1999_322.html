<b>JUDGMENT (Inquiry as to Damages)</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> These reasons relate to the inquiry as to damages
ordered when judgment was given for the plaintiff for damages on 19 April 1996.
I contemplated that the inquiry would be simple and could be conducted on
affidavit in Private Chambers, but there was a large body
of evidence including
cross-examination and the hearing took about eight hours in total on 5, 18 and
19 March 1999.  These reasons
must be read with the judgment published on 19
April 1996.  The order for the inquiry was:-
<P>

	<i>"1.  Give judgment for the plaintiff for damages for breach of the first
sub-paragraph of clause 4 of Terms of Settlement dated 25
March 1988 as
ascertained and certified on inquiry."</i>
<P>

2	The breaches found consisted of including the names of two products of the
plaintiff in two Stock Item Quotation forms which SRA
sent to Maxwell Chemicals
Pty Ltd on 12 July 1988 and in two Purchase Orders also sent to Maxwell
Chemicals on 27 July and 14 September
1988.  The Stock Item Quotations forms
each included, at an inappropriate place, the name of one of the plaintiff's
products, and
the Purchase Orders each included the name of a product of the
plaintiff.  These were breaches of the first agreement in Clause 4
of the Terms
of Settlement of 25 March 1988 by which it was agreed that the defendant should
not publish in any quotation, tender
documents or specification any reference
to the plaintiff's firm name or brand name of its graffiti remover products
<i>"So Safe"</i> and <i>"So Safe Concrete"</i>.  I found that the purpose of
this agreement was to prevent the association of the plaintiff's firm name or
brand name with any particular
definition of product because by making that
association SRA would indicate to anyone who saw the publication that the goods
described
and the plaintiff's products were so close to being the same that the
SRA was prepared to treat one as the other.  It was communicated
to Maxwell
Chemicals that products supplied in accordance with the description and
reference numbers given were regarded by SRA as
the equivalent of the
plaintiff's products. After SRA had approved the Stock Item Quotations, the
Purchase Orders showed Maxwell
Chemicals that from the point of view of SRA
Maxwell Chemicals product was the same as the plaintiff's product.
<P>

3	Whether any loss to the plaintiff was caused by these breaches, the
communication of the name of the plaintiff's product to Maxwell
Chemicals and
the obvious inferences which Maxwell Chemicals could draw would depend on
whether Maxwell Chemicals then knew of the
plaintiff's products and their
names, then knew that the SRA regarded the plaintiff's named products as
conforming to the goods for
which quotations were called and which were
ordered, and, if in fact the events conveyed any information to Maxwell
Chemicals which
Maxwell Chemicals did not then know, what use Maxwell Chemicals
made of the information.  There was however no evidence which dealt
with
Maxwell Chemicals' previous state of knowledge, or whether Maxwell Chemicals
drew the inference, or made any use of the information.
<P>

4	The plaintiff under its former name Bracton Chemical Co Pty Limited carried
on business as manufacturer and wholesaler of industrial
cleaning chemicals and
products.  After a period of testing it had by early 1986 developed two
graffiti removers, one called <i>"So Safe Graffiti Remover For Concrete"</i> or
<i>"So Safe Concrete" </i>and one called <i>"So Safe Graffiti Remover"</i> or
<i>"So Safe Painted Surfaces"</i>.  The plaintiff embarked on marketing these
products throughout Australia and retained a marketing sales consultant which
was paid
by commission on sales;  the principal of the consultant was Mr
Winkler.  The plaintiff approached the SRA requesting that it be
considered as
a supplier of graffiti removal products about mid-May 1986 and after testing
for safety SRA gave orders for the products
from June 1986 onwards.  The orders
came from particular station masters or depot managers (called Local Purchase
Orders) at first
but from May 1987 onwards there were also bulk purchases
through SRA's central supply system.  SRA Stores Depot allocated material
identification (MI) numbers to the products;  Mr Hunter's evidence was:-
<P>

	<i>"The SRA's Stores Depot allocates material identification numbers to each
generic product it stocks and to products of each supplier."
</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>All dealings with central stores are required to use the MI number and
product description allocated by central stores and these appear
on
containers.
<P>

5	The business of supply to SRA was very successful and by May 1987 there was
no other supplier of graffiti remover to SRA.  The
plaintiff sold to other
customers and its sales to other customers were assisted by the fact that
people saw products in use by SRA
staff.  Sometimes customers referred to this
when they telephoned with orders.
<P>

6	The proceedings settled by the Terms of Settlement were brought by the
plaintiff in this Division by Summons filed on 24 February
1988 claiming an
injunction restraining disclosure of a trade secret or confidential information
being the chemical formula and/or
specifications for the plaintiff's products.
The Terms of Settlement left it open to the plaintiff to bring other
proceedings and
to claim damages in respect of past or future disclosure of
confidential information.
<P>

7	In April 1988 SRA issued invitations to quote for the supply of graffiti
remover to Maxwell Chemicals and to the plaintiff, and
sent them a
specification prepared by SRA and not containing any reference to the plaintiff
or its products;  the specification indicated
what the suppliers were asked to
quote to supply.  Maxwell replied, quoting to supply products of its own on the
basis that they
conformed to the specifications furnished by SRA.  The
plaintiff also submitted a quotation.  SRA, having the competing quotations
before it, made a decision to accept the Maxwell Chemical's quotation, on the
professed ground that the quotations were cheaper.
 They were indeed markedly
cheaper.  In my view there was no reason in the evidence to conclude that the
professed ground for deciding
to buy Maxwell Chemical's products was not the
true ground and no reason for finding that SRA had any motivation other than a
wish
to obtain product which conformed to its specifications at the best
commercial terms available for sending its orders to Maxwell
Chemicals.  SRA
then sent purchase orders to Maxwell Chemicals.
<P>

8	In July 1988 SRA again invited quotations in respect of two different
products;  these two invitations to quote are the first
two of the four
documents which have been found to be subject to breaches.  Maxwell replied
quoting to supply its own products, which
were already known to SRA as a result
of the earlier round of quotations.  In its reply Maxwell used the name of its
own products,
and quoted the prices at which it was then prepared to supply
them.  The plaintiff also made quotations in this round, but was again
severely
beaten on price.  SRA decided, as I find on the basis of price, to purchase
Maxwell products and later sent out the second
two documents which are the
subject of findings of breaches so as to obtain product.  SRA continued to buy
from Maxwell for some
years, and commercial opportunities in the market for the
plaintiff's products, including its relationship with its sales consultant,
fell away from the plaintiff, so that those two products became much less
commercially successful.
<P>

9	There is no indication in the evidence that by in effect telling Maxwell
Chemicals that the plaintiff's product fitted SRA's specifications
SRA brought
about any change or alteration in Maxwell Chemical's course or in its
commercial behaviour.  Maxwell Chemicals had already
decided to quote and had
quoted for the supply of its products on the basis of the SRA specifications
and on prices with which the
plaintiff did not compete.  When SRA sent orders
to Maxwell Chemicals, it supplied goods in accordance with those orders, and
the
standard which the goods had to meet was set by the specification by
reference to which SRA had earlier invited quotations.  The
plaintiff had no
contractual right to remain in supply, and ordinary commercial rationality
shows that its expectations of continuing
in supply were completely bound up
with the price at which a rival product which SRA had decided to accept was
available.
<P>

10	The plaintiff put forward an elaborate structure of claims for loss of
profits and other consequential losses built on the foundation
of allegations
that SRA purchased from Maxwell Chemicals and not from the plaintiff not
because of a price differential but because
SRA was aware that it had committed
breaches of the agreement of 25 March 1988 and that it might be sued for
damages including damages
in respect of earlier complaints on which the earlier
proceedings had been based, and that this led SRA in some way to avoid dealing
with the plaintiff.  This structure was not supported by evidence or reasoning,
and was not accommodated to the large price differences
and the obvious
sufficiency of the price differences as an explanation of SRA's choice as to
where it sent its orders.  An aspect
of this structure was a contention to the
effect that Maxwell Chemical's goods were in fact very unsatisfactory to SRA's
staff, from
which it was to be inferred that SRA only bought them to spite the
plaintiff.  Evidence called by SRA shows clearly that it did buy
significant
quantities of unsatisfactory goods from Maxwell Chemicals, but it did so
because SRA mistakenly ordered the wrong product,
and then had to buy other
product from Maxwell Chemicals and have the goods reformulated, using both
sources and with the assistance
of Maxwell Chemicals.  There is no reason for
thinking that if the ordering mistake had not been made, Maxwell Chemicals
product
would not have been satisfactory.
<P>

11	In any event even if SRA really had avoided purchasing the plaintiff's
products out of some consciousness that the earlier damages
claim might be
revived or a further damages claim might be brought, there could be no ground
on which SRA's behaviour of that kind
could be seen as caused by the appearance
of the names of the plaintiff's product in the four documents referred to and
the breaches
thus constituted of the agreement in the Terms of Settlement.
<P>

12	Some complaints were also made of SRA using the same material information or
MI number for references to the products of the
plaintiff and of Maxwell
Chemicals.  There was no reason why this should be regarded as suspicious or an
infraction of the plaintiff's
rights;  and no reason why it should be regarded
as relevant to the infraction of the plaintiff's rights which gives rise to the
present inquiry.  It was also said that the breaches showed that SRA had come
to treat the plaintiff's trade names as generic of
product;  in my opinion the
evidence does not show that this is correct, but if it were it would not be a
breach of the rights which
give rise to the present inquiry.
<P>

13	In my judgment the plaintiff has failed to prove any actual loss caused by
the breaches as found.  The plaintiff is entitled
to nominal damages in respect
of the four breaches, as they are breaches of contract, and I must give
judgment for the plaintiff
for a nominal sum.
<P>

14	<b>ORDER:</b>
<P>

Upon the inquiry directed by order 2 of the orders of 19 April 1996 I have
ascertained and I certify that the damages recoverable
by the plaintiff for
breach of the first sub-paragraph of Clause 4 of Terms of Settlement dated 25
March 1986 are $1.00.
<P>

					I certify that paragraphs 1-14 are the reasons for judgment of the
Honourable Justice John Bryson.
<P>

Date:  13 April 1999.      (J.Stevenson)
