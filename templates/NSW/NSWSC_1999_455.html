LTD &amp; ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff seeks an interlocutory injunction against the
first defendant.  It is inappropriate to make any finding
of fact or to inquire
into anything more than whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a serious
question to be determined.  However
for today's purposes, the facts are mostly
not in dispute.
<P>

2	The plaintiff entered into a contract with the first defendant pursuant to
which the plaintiff carried out certain building work
for the first defendant.
That work was residential building work within the meaning of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home
Building Act</a> </b>1989 (as amended).  Accordingly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.92(1)</a> prohibited the
plaintiff from contracting to do that work unless a contract of insurance
complying with the Act was in force; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.92(2)</a> prohibited the plaintiff from
contracting to do that work unless a certificate of insurance evidencing that
contract of insurance
was attached to the building contract; and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.94(1)</a>
provided that if there was a breach of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.92(1)</a>, the plaintiff
could not enforce the contract or recover any money in respect of the work
carried out under the contract, although
the plaintiff remains liable to the
first defendant for any breach of contract.
<P>

3		The contract was written.  It comprised some sixty pages of printing and
typewriting in total.  On its face it was prepared by
the solicitors for the
first defendant.  It is established sufficiently for present purposes that it
was proffered to the plaintiff
by the first defendant, and that the parties had
a meeting in the office of the solicitors for the first defendant, held on 4
August
1998.  It was then executed by the first defendant after the parties
agreed orally to contract upon the terms recorded. However,
it was not formally
executed on behalf of the plaintiff until sometime shortly after that meeting.
The exact date is not demonstrated
at this stage.
<P>

4	At the meeting of 4 August, the solicitors acting for the first defendant
spoke to Mr Lau, a director of the plaintiff, of the
necessity of the plaintiff
obtaining the relevant contract of insurance.  According to Mr Lau, the
solicitor said that it had to
be procured before the building started.  This
particular statement is disputed.  Mr Lau had not entered into any building
contract
since the legislation introducing <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.92</a> had been enacted, and he was
unaware of its provisions. He took steps to obtain a contract of insurance and
obtained one no later
than 24 August. 
<P>

5	The building work did not start until 27 August.  On 24 August, Mr Lau and Mr
Tran, a director of the first defendant, went together
to the offices of the
Local Council, and on this occasion Mr Tran was shown a certificate of
insurance which the plaintiff had by
then procured. 
<P>

6	In its Statement of Claim, the plaintiff advanced a number of propositions
calculated to enable it to avoid a defence which the
first defendant had
foreshadowed, namely that by the force of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 92</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 94</a>, the plaintiff cannot
enforce the contract.
<P>

7	The plaintiff invokes s.51AC of the Trade Practices Act.  The first defendant
resists this claim, in the first instance by reference
to s.51AC(10) which
relates to contracts exceeding one million dollars.  Secondly the plaintiff
advances a claim of unconscionable
conduct by reference to general equitable
principles.  Thirdly there is a claim in estoppel, and fourthly there is a
claim of unjust
enrichment. 
<P>

8	In my view the plaintiff has demonstrated sufficiently for today's purposes a
claim in estoppel.  Remembering that there is a
dispute as to what was said on
the 4 August, on the plaintiff's case there was a representation made to the
plaintiff to the effect
that the plaintiff only needed a contract of insurance
before starting the work, rather than before making the building contract.
 The
plaintiff relied upon that representation and the plaintiff would now be
disadvantaged if the first defendant was permitted
to retreat from that
representation.
<P>

9	On the plaintiff's case, there was a misrepresentation made on 4 August.
Additionally, the first defendant, represented as it
was by solicitors, knew of
the provisions of s.92 as at 4 August when the plaintiff did not, and it might
be that the appropriate
inference on the trial will be that the first defendant
knew of the provisions of s.92(2) as well as s.92(1). 
<P>

10	Additionally, after the plaintiff obtained a certificate of insurance, the
first defendant objected to its form in that it did
not mention the particular
building site in question individually, and the plaintiff took steps to obtain
a second certificate of
insurance which did mention that building site
individually.
<P>

11	Thereafter the first defendant permitted the plaintiff to do a good deal of
work or at least stood by whilst the plaintiff did
that work. The plaintiff
submitted various progress claims, various certificates were given, and various
progress claims were made.
 After a time the plaintiff made another progress
claim for some $250,000 which was not met.  Then the first defendant terminated
or purported to terminate the plaintiff's employment under the contract by
reference solely to the breach of s.92. 
<P>

12	I repeat, I do not find these as facts.  Rather I find that the plaintiff
has demonstrated that there are serious questions to
be determined to this
effect.  On the basis of this finding, I need not go on to consider however the
other bases upon which the
plaintiff's claim has been advanced. 
<P>

13	The parties then argued the question of the balance of convenience by
reference to the four injunctions now sought, recorded
in the document titled
"Short Minutes of Order" which I have marked "Draft", dated and initialled, and
which I will leave with the
court papers.
<P>

14	I will proceed by summarising the effect of the four orders sought, by way
of verbal shorthand only. 
<P>

15	Order 1 seeks to restrain the first defendant from calling upon certain bank
guarantees procured by the plaintiff pursuant to
the terms of the contract.
The first defendant says, in brief, that there is no occasion for the
injunction now sought because the
occasions upon which the guarantees might be
called up have not yet arisen, pointing out that the first defendant has made
no threat
to call upon them.
<P>

16	That is true, but the first defendant has made a claim upon the plaintiff,
which the plaintiff disputes, and which might lead
to a call upon the
guarantees later on.  The balance of convenience seems to me to lie in favour
of granting the injunction sought,
unless the parties can agree upon some
satisfactory intermediate course, perhaps an undertaking by the first defendant
not to call
upon the guarantees without adequate prior notice.  For the moment,
if the order sought was made, there seems to be no significant
disadvantage to
the first defendant except that it might need to move to have that order
vacated.  On the other hand if the order
was not made, it is easy to foresee
the possibility that the plaintiff might suffer significant detriment.
<P>

17	Order 2 relates to preventing the first defendant doing work on the building
site.  I understand the real purpose of the order
to be to enable the plaintiff
to collect evidence which might be useful to the plaintiff if and when there is
a hearing relating
to a dispute about the quality of the building work.  On
balance it seems to me that whilst it might be appropriate to grant an
injunction
for a short time, that is for a matter of a few days or thereabouts,
a better solution would be to make an order under Pt.25, r.8
for the inspection
of the property by appropriately qualified people.  I will invite the parties
to make further submissions as to
this at the conclusion of my giving these
reasons for judgment.
<P>

18	Orders 3 and 4 relate to goods on the building site, owned either by the
plaintiff or by strangers to the contract, placed on
the site by or on behalf
of the plaintiff whilst the plaintiff was engaged in the building work,
generally in the nature of tools,
equipment and building materials.
<P>

19	The first defendant does not oppose the making of some order enabling
strangers to the contract to remove their property provided
appropriate
arrangements can be worked out, but it does assert a contractual right to
retain the plaintiff's equipment now that the
plaintiff's employment under the
contract has been terminated pursuant to the terms of the contract.
<P>

20	Proceeding on the basis that the plaintiff has demonstrated a serious
question to be determined,  I do not understand the plaintiff
to say that there
is any great problem involved if the plaintiff's property is retained for the
time being on this basis.  Subject
to whatever submissions might be made in a
minute or two, I am minded to make an order generally as sought in paragraph 4
of the
short minutes, which seems preferable to order 3, but limited to the
property of strangers to the contract. It might be that the
parties will be
able to agree upon the precise terms.
<P>

21	Before passing from the case, I observe that on the occasion of the second
reading speech of the Building Services Corporation
Legislation Amending Bill,
the Minister for Fair Trading and the Minister for Women, the Honourable Mrs Lo
Po' said that the purpose
of the legislation, the effect of which was to
introduce s.92 and s.94 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act</a></b>, was to protect
consumers.
<P>

22	She was of course speaking in the context of contracts relating to
residential building work. I venture to say no reasonable
person could quarrel
with that objective, but the present case demonstrates that the words of Act
may go far beyond the legislative
intention, as demonstrated by the Minister's
speech, and may do so in a way that some people would regard as quite unjust. I
do not
for one moment criticise the first defendant in this case, which is not
seeking to do any more than assert rights which the first
defendant says the
Act gives it.
<P>

23	However it is to be observed if the first defendant is correct, the effect
would be that the first defendant, a corporation adequately
advised by
professional people of different disciplines including solicitors, entered into
a contract with a builder at a contract
price which was in excess of $2.5
million; and that contract related to the construction, it seems, of twenty
seven home units, which
the first defendant hopes to sell for $7 million. That
is, it hardly qualifies as needing protection as a consumer.  It seems to
me
fair to say that the legislative intention, as measured by reference to the
Minister's speech, can be achieved fairly readily
by an amendment to the
legislation which would go a great way to preventing what many people would
regard as an injustice.
<P>

24	I will ask the Registrar to forward a copy of these reasons for judgment to
the relevant Minister. 
<P>

<P>

25	I will stand the matter into tomorrow's list in order that short minutes can
be brought in.
