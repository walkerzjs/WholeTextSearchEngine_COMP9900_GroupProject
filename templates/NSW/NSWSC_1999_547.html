<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>DUNFORD J.</b>   On 24 April 1994, Mrs Toula Soravia was
shot outside a bank in Summer Hill whilst seated in the front seat of her motor
car next
to her son, Alexander.  David John Zammit was charged with her murder
and his committal hearing set down for 16 January 1995 at Central
Local Court.
The plaintiff, who is and was a barrister-at-law, was instructed to appear at
the committal hearing on behalf of David
John Zammit and on that day made
submissions to the magistrate that Alexander Soravia should not be excused from
attending the committal
for cross-examination under s 48EA of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a></i></b> as it then stood, because he was not a
<i>"victim"</i> of the murder within the terms of the section.
<P>

2   	The following day, 17 January 1995, the second defendant,
an employee of the first defendant, broadcast over radio station
2UE and its
relay stations the matter set out in Annexure A to the Statement of Claim.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff through his solicitor sought a withdrawal and
apology which were not forthcoming, whereupon the plaintiff sued
the defendant
alleging the following defamatory imputations:
<P>

(a)	that he behaved shamefully in seeking to cross-examine a young man who had
seen his mother shot dead in front of him;
<P>

(b)	that decent lawyers would deplore his conduct at the committal hearing of
David John Zammitt for the murder of Toula Soravia;
<P>

(c)	that he is unfit to be a lawyer;
<P>

(d)	that he is a heartless person; and
<P>

(e)	that he is not a gentleman.
<P>

4   	At the beginning of the trial I ruled that the matter was
not capable of bearing imputation (b):  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/291.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 291.</a>
<P>

5   	In accordance with the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i></b>,
(the Act) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(3)</a> a jury was thereupon empanelled to determine whether the
matter complained of carried the remaining four imputations alleged, and
if so,
whether they were defamatory of the plaintiff.
<P>

6   	The jury found that the matter carried two of the four
imputations namely:
<P>

(a)	That the plaintiff behaved shamefully in seeking to cross-examine a young
man who had seen his mother shot dead in front of
him, and
<P>

(d)	That the plaintiff is a heartless person, 
<P>

and that such imputations were defamatory of the plaintiff.  
<P>

7   	I thereupon directed the entry of judgment for the
defendants in respect of the imputations (b) (c) and (e).  The only defence
ultimately relied on by the defendants was comment <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 32</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">33</a> of the Act).

<P>

8   	The plaintiff who is thirty-nine years old, was educated in
Sydney and joined the NSW Police Service in 1979.  From 1981 to
1986 he worked
as a police prosecutor whilst studying for the Solicitors' Admission Board
exams which he completed in 1985, the same
year he was admitted to the Bar and
he commenced practice in 1986.  He specialised in criminal cases but did other
work as well,
and was briefed mainly by suburban and country firms.  He was at
the time of the broadcast married with two children, but he separated
from his
wife finally about the end of 1995 and has subsequently been divorced, this
following approximately four prior separations.
 He has been involved in soccer
virtually all his life at a high semi-professional level and in 1994 and 1995
he was captain of the
Pittwater Club team and again in 1988.  He has a wide
circle of friends through soccer, his police associates, barristers' chambers
and neighbours in the areas where he has lived.
<P>

9   	He knew first of the broadcast the following evening during
soccer training at Mona Vale when one of the other players, a Mr
Mahoney,
referred to it and said he had been mentioned in the broadcast and asked
whether he had got himself into trouble in a court
case for trying to
cross-examine a witness when he should not have.  The plaintiff said that on
hearing this remark he felt as though
he had been kicked in the stomach hard,
he was acutely embarrassed and felt unable to help himself, he was concerned to
know exactly
what had been said, he could not understand why he had been
criticised in this way, or at all.  When told the broadcaster was the
second
defendant he realised the matter had been spoken on a morning radio program on
the first defendant's station, which he believed
had a massive coverage in New
South Wales and other areas.  He said another player, a Mr Hennessey,
approached him that same evening
and said that he had heard criticism of him on
the radio.  With two people having mentioned it to him, he was upset and angry
and
he instructed his solicitor to apply for a tape or transcript of the
broadcast.
<P>

10   	Two nights later he received a telephone call from a Mr
Silvester who had been a friend since they were both in fourth grade
at primary
school, and who was at that time a serving member of the Police Service with
the rank of Sergeant, who asked him, "Do
you know you got a bagging from Ray
Hadley, have you done something wrong?"  He told him he had not, whereupon Mr
Silvester asked
him, "What's it all about?"  He explained to him what had
happened and that he had not done anything wrong whereupon Mr Silvester
said,
"Some of the blokes down at the Police Station have been talking about it.
There was a suggestion that you had acted unethically.
 I though I had better
call you and tell you."
<P>

11   	He said he felt extremely depressed, empty, unable to help
himself or defend himself, he started to wonder whether he had
done something
wrong and whether there would be a complaint to the Bar Association.  
<P>

12   	Shortly afterwards he received a copy of the tape which he
played to himself, his first reaction was one of devastation, he
had never
heard a barrister criticised so seriously, he was indignant, hurt and
particularly devastated by the sarcasm, that is the
sarcasm that he would not
be able to look at himself in the mirror, and the pause before the word
"gentleman".  He felt down for
the remainder of the committal, sleeping only
about two hours per night if he was lucky, he lost weight, was withdrawn and
had a
constant headache.  He said as time went by his most fundamental reaction
was that he thought the broadcast was absolutely unfair
and unbalanced, he felt
unable to defend himself and wanted an immediate and unequivocal apology.  He
discussed the broadcast with
his wife and noticed that the discussion upset her
as well.  
<P>

13   	He was particularly upset by imputation (a), that he
behaved shamefully in seeking to cross-examine the son of the deceased,
because
he regarded it as a slur on him and his reputation.  He had worked hard to be a
barrister and made sacrifices, and he found
it utterly galling to be judged and
condemned on a matter of professional ethics by a sports commentator.  He was
also upset by the
suggestion that he was a heartless person as he always
considered himself caring, has done pro-bono work at the Bar, and spent a
lot
of time speaking with his clients and their relatives seeking to allay their
fears and explaining the possible outcomes.  His
solicitor demanded apologies
from each defendant (exhibit G) and received replies refusing same (exhibit H).
Those replies included
an offer for the plaintiff to go on air to put his side
of the story, but he didn't want a debate and he did not trust the second
defendant; he wanted an apology.
<P>

14   	His matter was listed for hearing but not reached.  It
subsequently was listed for hearing in September last year before Greg
James J
but as a result of various interlocutory applications was adjourned.  
<P>

15   	The plaintiff claimed that his feelings were upset and
aggravated on that occasion by some of the remarks made by senior counsel
then
appearing for the defendants, particularly a statement that there was an
obvious defence of truth to the imputation alleging
that he was unfit to be a
barrister, a suggestion that damages in the range of $300,000 were absurd, a
suggestion that the plaintiff
should be paying the defendants and other similar
remarks referred to in the evidence.  Subsequently when justification and
contextual
truth were pleaded to the imputation that he was unfit to be a
barrister, he was flabbergasted that another set of lawyers could
make such a
suggestion and he was grossly offended.  This was aggravated when at the
commencement of the present hearing senior counsel
now appearing for the
defendants said that there was no suggestion in the broadcast that the
plaintiff was not acting perfectly properly.
 
<P>

16   	He said that he was not re-appointed captain of the
football team in 1996 or 1997, but there was no evidence that this was
in any
way due to the broadcast.  He also gave evidence of remarks made to him by an
old friend, Steven Spackman, when they met in
Balmain in about December 1997.
Although the plaintiff's version of what was said to him at football training
two days after the
broadcast was not challenged, his version of what was said
to him by Mr Spackman was, but Mr Spackman was not called as a witness
and
there was no explanation given for his non-appearance.  In these circumstances
I draw the inference that his evidence would not
have assisted the plaintiff,
and although I consider it probable that Mr Spackman did make some comment
about the broadcast, I am
not satisfied that it was in the form or to the
effect claimed by the plaintiff.  
<P>

17   	The plaintiff agreed that prior to the separation from his
wife there would have been periods of emotional distress, and it
must also be
taken into account that the plaintiff's insomnia, feeling down and withdrawn,
and loss of weight could well have been
due in part to the strain of the
committal hearing, which on the plaintiff's own evidence was a very stressful
hearing for the defence
team; but I am satisfied that this was aggravated by
his reaction to the broadcast itself.  The plaintiff claims no economic loss
as
a result of the broadcast. 
<P>

18   	The plaintiff's ex-wife gave evidence that his reputation
was as a hardworking, trustworthy, reliable barrister who generally
got good
results, and that he was a devoted and loving father to their children, had a
good reputation as a sportsman and a general
reputation as a generous, kind,
fun-loving person who enjoyed life and who was looked on favourably by most
people as always being
there if someone needed help.  She noticed that after
the broadcast he was worried that all his hard work over the years to establish
his reputation as a barrister would be affected, and that for about a month he
was very stressed and reserved in his demeanour and
worried most of the
time.
<P>

19   	Mr AJ Bellanto QC gave evidence of the plaintiff's
reputation as a barrister which he described as very good, and said his
reputation otherwise was as a caring father who took an interest in his
children's activities, generally well liked and well respected.
 Other
witnesses who knew him gave similar evidence of his reputation both in soccer
circles and generally.  None of them gave evidence
that they thought less of
him because of the broadcast.  
<P>

20   	The Rules of the New South Wales Bar Association relating
to conduct, both at the time the applicant was admitted to the Bar
and in
January 1995, were admitted into evidence as was the article in the Daily
Telegraph from which the second defendant had obtained
his information.  There
was also evidence of the listening audience of 2UE at the relevant time and
also the names and addresses
of the other radio stations in rural New South
Wales and interstate to which the broadcast was relayed, and the approximate
audience
range of those stations.
<P>

<b>DEFENCE OF COMMENT</b>
<P>

21   	To make good a defence of comment, a defendant must
show:
<P>

(a)	that the imputation is a comment and not a statement of fact,
<P>

(b)	that it relates to a matter of public interest (s 31),
<P>

(c)	that it is based on proper material for comment (s 30),
<P>

and the defence will be defeated if the plaintiff shows that at the time the
comment was made such comment did not represent the
opinion or honest belief of
the defendant (s 32(2)) or of its servant or agent (s 33(3)).
<P>

22   	I refer to the "imputation" rather than to the "material
giving rise to the imputation" because although there appears to
have been some
uncertainty, the issue has been resolved by the recent decision of the Court of
Appeal in <b><i>NSW Aboriginal Land Council v Perkins</i></b> (1998) 45 NSWLR
340 following <b><i>Lloyd v David Syme &amp; Co Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 728</a>
PC.  In <b><i>Perkins</i></b>, Priestly JA at 345-6 quoted with approval what
Clarke JA had said in <b><i>Radio 2UE Pty Ltd v Parker </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR
448</a> at 469:
<P>

". . . the defence of comment will arise for consideration by the jury only
when it has found that the imputations for which the
plaintiff contends (or
ones substantially similar) were conveyed by the material published and that
those imputations were defamatory.
 Once the defence of comment is raised the
jury is required to consider whether the imputation it has found to arise was
made by
the defendant as an allegation of fact or as an expression of opinion,
on facts stated, or sufficiently indicated, in the published
matter.  For that
purpose it is not to the point that the plaintiff has pleaded his imputation as
a statement of fact.  The question
is to be determined upon a consideration of
the published material."
<P>

See also Meagher JA at 349, where his Honour pointed out that although the
issue is whether the defamatory imputations constitute
comment, in determining
that question regard may be had to the material out of which the imputation
arose.
<P>

23   	Imputation (a), that the plaintiff behaved shamefully in
seeking to cross-examine a young man who had seen his mother shot
dead in front
of him, is in my view clearly a comment.  The imputation itself as found sets
out facts namely that the plaintiff sought
to cross-examine the young man in
the circumstances indicated, and in relation to those facts expresses what I am
satisfied the ordinary
listener would understand as an opinion on that conduct,
namely the opinion that he behaved shamefully.  This becomes even clearer
when
the whole of the broadcast material is taken into account.  The second
defendant has set out what happened at the committal
hearing, and then
discusses the conduct of the plaintiff, which the jury have found conveyed the
imputation that such conduct was
"shameful" and the listener can judge whether
he or she agrees that in the circumstances the plaintiff's conduct was
"shameful".
 On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that the imputation
could not be comment unless some part of the matter complained of
was
"congruent" with the imputation and expressed as a comment, and referred to
<b><i>David Syme &amp; Co Ltd v Lloyd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20NSWLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3 NSWLR 346</a> at 355.  I
reject this submission; if correct it would mean that if a plaintiff could
frame an imputation without using words from
the publication or broadcast, the
defence of comment would never be available.
<P>

24   	As to imputation (d), that the plaintiff is a heartless
person, that imputation is expressed as a bald statement of fact,
and although
the imputation does not have to be "expressed" as an opinion in order to
constitute a comment, there is nothing in the
material broadcast which leads me
to conclude that this imputation is merely expressed as an opinion or comment.
It does not relate
to his conduct in the committal or as a barrister, but is in
general terms, that he is a "heartless person".  The material asserts,
in the
form of a rhetorical question, that there is "no compassion in his life" which
I consider the ordinary reasonable listener
would regard as a reference to his
life in general, and there are no facts stated or identified relating to his
life in general from
which the listener can judge for himself whether he or she
agrees with the imputation.  In this regard, I consider the imputation
bears
some similarities to the matter complained of in <b><i>O'Shaughnessy v Mirror
Newspapers Ltd </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20125%20CLR%20166" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 125 CLR 166</a> at 174.
<P>

25   	The second requirement is that the imputation relates to a
matter of public interest.  The administration of justice and the
conduct of
those who take part in it are matters of public interest:  <b><i>Bellino v
Australian Broadcasting Corporation </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20185%20CLR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 185 CLR 183</a> at 217-8 and
imputation (a) in my view clearly relates to the conduct of the plaintiff as a
lawyer in the committal proceedings and
so relates to a matter of public
interest.
<P>

26   	On the other hand, the second imputation as found does not
confine itself to the plaintiff's conduct in relation to the conduct
of the
committal proceedings but asserts that he is a heartless person i.e. a
heartless person generally.  The imputation in these
terms, as found by the
jury, is consistent with the words actually used in the material broadcast such
as the references to looking
at himself in the mirror and no compassion <i>"in
your life"</i> (my emphasis).  I therefore find that imputation (d) did not
relate to a matter of public interest.  It is not correct, as Mr Rares
SC
submitted, to say that all the second defendant did was to set out the facts
about the committal hearing and then say that in
relation to his conduct of the
case, the plaintiff's conduct was "shameful and heartless".  The jury found two
imputations proved;
imputation (a) was related to his conduct at the committal,
but imputation (d) was not so confined.
<P>

27   	For the defence of comment, an imputation must be based on
"proper material for comment", which includes facts which are matters
of
substantial truth where the comment represents an opinion which might
reasonably be based on that material (s 30).  Once again
the defendant has
difficulties in relation to imputation (d) because, accepting that the
committal proceedings and the plaintiff's
part therein were matters of
substantial truth and the subject of a protected report under s 24 (proceedings
in public in a court)
the imputation that the plaintiff is a heartless person,
i.e. a heartless person generally, is not an opinion which might reasonably
be
based on material relating only to the committal proceedings.  There is no
reasonable connection between his conduct as a barrister
in the committal and
the description of his general character as heartless, and so there was no
proper material for comment in relation
to the imputation that he was a
heartless person generally, which was the imputation found by the jury:
<b><i>NSW Aboriginal Land Council v Perkins </i></b>at 350.
<P>

28   	In relation to imputation (a) the main submission on
behalf of the plaintiff was that a comment that the plaintiff behaved
shamefully in the circumstances could not reasonably be based on the material
disclosed concerning the committal proceedings because
the second defendant
conceded in the broadcast that Mr Alan Sullivan QC had told him that lawyers
are bound to act in the best interests
of their clients; but I see no reason
why, as a layman, he was bound to accept lawyers' standards, and consider that
he was entitled
to express the opinion that, irrespective of lawyers'
standards, the conduct of the plaintiff was shameful.
<P>

29   	Comments do not have to be correct, justified or
reasonable provided they are honestly held and the second defendant was
entitled
to express the opinion (that the plaintiff's conduct was shameful)
even though lawyers might regard his views as prejudiced, exaggerated
or
obstinate:  <b><i>Cawley v Australian Consolidated Press </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR
225</a> at 235, <b><i>Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%201%20WLR%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] 1 WLR 743</a>
at 747.
<P>

30   	I therefore find that imputation (a) was comment on a
matter of public interest and based on proper material for comment,
but that
imputation (d) was none of those, and the defence of comment accordingly fails
in relation to imputation (d).
<P>

31   	As to imputation (a) it was submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff that the defence was defeated because the comment that the
plaintiff
acted shamefully in the conduct of the committal was not an opinion honestly
held by the second defendant; and to establish
this proposition (the onus of
which lies on the plaintiff) a number of matters were relied on, including:
<P>

(a)	The second defendant admitted in the broadcast that he had been told by Mr
Alan Sullivan QC that lawyers are paid to act in
the best interests of their
clients and had also been given an explanation by him as to why lawyers
sometimes say the things they
do,
<P>

(b)	Submissions made by defendants' counsel in his address to the jury to the
effect that what the second defendant was trying to
say was not that the
plaintiff was a heartless person, but that he had had a heartless task to do,
and that it was really the definition
of "victim" in the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices
Act</a></i></b> that was wrong,
<P>

(c)	As imputation (a) was not what the second defendant intended to say; and as
he had not been called as a witness, I should find
that imputation (a) as found
did not represent his honest opinion and <b><i>Jones v Dunkel </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959)
101 CLR 298</a> was referred to.  
<P>

32   	I have already considered the information received by the
second defendant from Mr Sullivan QC, and for the reasons given,
consider that
the receipt of this information is not evidence that the opinion expressed was
not honestly held by the second defendant.
<P>

33   	Although it is true that for a defendant to say that he
did not intend to convey the imputation that the jury found to have
been
conveyed is some evidence that he did not at the time hold that opinion, there
is no evidence that such was the position in
this case, and the principles of
<b><i>Jones and Dunkel</i></b> mean that the failure of the second defendant to
give evidence cannot make up a gap in the evidence and lead to a positive
inference
in favour of the party carrying the onus of proof on this issue.
Moreover, the references to defence counsel's address to the jury
overlook that
counsel's addresses are not evidence; and in any event, the passages referred
to confuse, possibly deliberately, the
two imputations found by the jury - the
references to being heartless, having to perform a heartless task etc, have
nothing to do
with imputation (a).
<P>

34   	The plaintiff has therefore not shown that imputation (a)
did not, at the time, represent the opinion of the second defendant
and it
follows that in relation to that imputation the defence of comment succeeds;
and I turn to consider the question of damages
in respect of imputation (d),
that the plaintiff  is a heartless person.
<P>

<b>DAMAGES</b>
<P>

35   	In assessing damages it is necessary to have regard to the
injury to the plaintiff's reputation, the hurt he himself has suffered,
and the
need for his vindication.  The plaintiff also seeks aggravated damages on
account of:
<P>

(a)	the refusal to apologise or retract whilst denying the matter was
defamatory;
<P>

(b)	the patent hostility to the plaintiff of the broadcast;
<P>

(c)	the defendants' conduct of the proceedings;
<P>

(d)	the second defendant's knowledge of the falsity of the imputation; and 
<P>

(e)	excessive publication outside New South Wales.
<P>

36   	Whilst the publication of defamatory matter presupposes
damages to the plaintiff's reputation and although there was evidence
that some
persons had spoken to the plaintiff in the days following the broadcast, none
of them were called to give evidence that
as a result of the broadcast they
thought less of the plaintiff.  Similarly none of the witnesses who gave
evidence of his good character
and reputation before the broadcast said that as
a result of the broadcast they thought less of the plaintiff or that his
reputation
was in any way actually diminished.  Indeed, none of them gave
evidence of actually hearing the broadcast or having its contents
reported to
them. 
<P>

37   	There is no claim for special damages nor any claim that
his practice as a barrister suffered in any way.
<P>

38   	As to the hurt to the plaintiff's feelings it is necessary
to bear in mind that the plaintiff has succeeded on only one of
five alleged
imputations and his damages must be referrable to that imputation.  In
describing his reaction to the broadcast, the
plaintiff said he feared that
there may be a complaint to the Bar Association, he was particularly upset by
the imputation that he
had behaved shamefully in seeking to cross-examine the
witness, and by his perception that the second defendant had said he was unfit
to be a barrister, and he was worried that all his hard work over the years to
establish his reputation as a barrister would be affected;
but the plaintiff
has failed in relation to imputations (a) (b) and (c), which are the
imputations alleged in relation to his conduct
and standing as a barrister, and
he is not entitled to damages in respect thereof.
<P>

39   	Similarly, he said that he was indignant at the pause in
the broadcast before the word "gentleman", but he has likewise failed
on
imputation (e), and similar considerations apply.
<P>

40   	However, he also said, and I accept, that he was also hurt
and upset by the suggestion that he was a "heartless person" and
that
imputation calls for significant damages, not only to compensate for the hurt
and loss of reputation suffered, but also to vindicate
the plaintiff.  He was
also hurt by the adjournment of the proceedings in September 1998 and by some
of the remarks made at that
time by counsel then appearing for the defendant,
including that there was an obvious defence of truth available to the
imputation
alleging that he was unfit to be a barrister, and also by the
pleading of defences of contextual truth and justification, subsequently
abandoned.
<P>

41   	As to aggravated damages, I take into account the conduct
of the defence case, referred to above, but regarding the request
for
retraction and apology, the plaintiff sought retraction and apology for more
than subsequent events have proved he was entitled
to; and although publication
of an apology may mitigate damages, a failure to do so does not increase the
plaintiff's hurt, widen
the area of publication or aggravate the plaintiff's
injury:  <b><i>Carson v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20178%20CLR%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 178 CLR 44</a>
at 66.  Accordingly, I do not take the failure to apologise into account.
<P>

42   	I have regard to the extensive coverage of the defendants'
broadcast in the Sydney metropolitan area and country New South
Wales,
particularly in those centres where the plaintiff practised and he may have
been known, but consider that even in those country
areas he would not have
been known outside legal professional circles and by people who had had
dealings with him in the courts as
clients, witnesses, police or relatives
thereof.
<P>

43   	I have regard to ss 45-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">47</a> of the Act and am satisfied that
imputation (d) was not true or a matter of substantial truth, and it was
published with a reckless
indifference to its truth or falsity, no enquires
having been made about his general character as opposed to his conduct of the
committal
hearing.  Moreover the attack on the plaintiff was expressed in
vituperative, sarcastic, mocking words and tone.
<P>

44   	Taking all these matters into account, I assess the
plaintiff's damages in respect of imputation (d) at $75,000.
<P>

45   	Accordingly, in respect of imputation (a) I direct the
entry of judgment for the defendant and in respect of imputation (d)
I direct
the entry of judgment for the plaintiff.  I will hear argument on the
plaintiff's claim for interest on the damages and
on the question of costs.
