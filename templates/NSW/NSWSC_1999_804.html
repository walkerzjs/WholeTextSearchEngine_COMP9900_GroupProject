<P>

SUPREME COURT OF
<P>

NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Friday, 6 August 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3431 of 1996	JOHN LAWRENCE MANGRAVITI   -v-   JOHN NORMAN STEVENS JACKSON
-   ESTATE OF THE LATE ANNA MANGRAVITI</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>. 
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 20 September 1996 the plaintiff, John
Lawrence Mangraviti, claims an order for provision for his maintenance,
education and advancement in life out of the estate of his late mother Anna
Mangraviti (to whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

3   	The deceased died on 31 May 1995, aged 94. 
<P>

4   	Probate in solemn form of the will of the deceased dated 7
February 1979 was on 17 April 1997 granted to John Norman Stevens
Jackson, the
surviving executor named in such will (who is the defendant to the present
proceedings). That probate was granted pursuant
to an order made on 15 April
1997 in proceedings 112966 of 1995 in the Probate Division, in which
proceedings the present defendant
was the plaintiff and cross-defendant, and
the present plaintiff was the defendant and cross-claimant. 
<P>

5   	The plaintiff is the youngest of the three children of the
deceased and her husband Giovanni Mangraviti, who had married in
Italy in 1918
and had settled in Australia in about 1921. The eldest child, Norman Joseph
(born on 31 July 1922) died on 8 February
1986; the middle child Joseph James
(born on 26 January 1924) died on 15 May 1991; the third child, John Lawrence,
the plaintiff,
was born on 29 August 1925, and is presently aged 73.
<P>

6   	The only provision made for the plaintiff in that will is
contained in clause 4, which provides,
<P>

<u>I GIVE AND BEQUEATH</u> unto my three sons in equal shares all such moneys
that I may hold to my credit in any Trading Bank or Savings Bank Account or in
any Building Society Account that I may conduct with any such Bank or Building
Society in the Commonwealth of Australia as at the
date of my death. 
<P>

7   	By clause 5 the deceased gave the residue of her estate to
her son Norman, provided that, if (as in the event happened) he
should
predecease her, then she gave the residue of her estate as to one half for her
son Joseph and as to the other half for her
grandchildren in equal shares as
tenants in common. 
<P>

8   	Since Joseph also predeceased his mother, the practical
effect of clause 4 is that one half of the estate of the deceased passes
to the
estate of Joseph, and the other half is divided equally among the eight
grandchildren of the deceased (being the three children
of Joseph and the five
children of the plaintiff), all of whom are adults. 
<P>

9   	The present assets of the estate consist of:
<P>

House property at 559 Sydney Road, Seaforth, having an estimated value of
$1,075,000;
<P>

Land known as Lot D, Ross Street, Seaforth, having an estimated value of
$591,250;
<P>

Moneys in various accounts with Westpac Banking Corporation, totalling about
$39,400;
<P>

Term deposit with Westpac Banking Corporation, $400,000;
<P>

Jewellery (having an estimated value of $22,454);
<P>

Moneys held in solicitor's trust account ($25,900).
<P>

10   	The estimated total value of the present assets of the
estate is a little over $2,154,000. From that sum must be deducted
the costs of
the defendant of the present proceedings, in an estimated amount of $50,000,
and also (in the event that he be successful)
the costs of the plaintiff, in an
estimated amount of $30,000. 
<P>

11   	It was agreed between the parties that, under the
provisions of clause 4 of the will, the plaintiff will receive from the
estate
of his mother about $20,000. 
<P>

12   	Clause 13 of the will is in the following terms,
<P>

<u>I HAVE CONSIDERED</u> the provisions I have made herein for each of my sons.
I am satisfied that my son <u>JOHN LAWRENCE MANGRAVITI</u> in my lifetime has
been adequately provided for and that he is of independent means and enjoys
with my son <u>JOSEPH JAMES MANGRAVITI</u> adequate income from personal
exertion and property investment. Although my son <u>NORMAN JOSEPH
MANGRAVITI</u> is a Medical Practitioner in my considered opinion the condition
of his health is such that he is unable to adequately carry on his
profession
and I have provided for him therefore accordingly but in so doing I have
exercised my love and affection equally for each
and every members [<i>sic</i>]
of my family. 
<P>

13   	The plaintiff in his affidavit evidence set forth what
might be described as the family history of his parents, his brothers
and
himself. As has already been recorded, the deceased and her husband (who had
originally emigrated to Australia as a boy in 1913,
but had subsequently
returned to Italy in 1918 to perform his military service, and had met and
married the deceased) settled in
Australia in about 1921. They became
Australian citizens about six years later. 
<P>

14   	It would appear that shortly after arriving in Australia
the plaintiff's father (to whom I shall refer as Giovanni) conducted
a
greengrocery business from premises at 370 Pacific Highway, Crows Nest. That
was a family business in which Giovanni, the deceased,
and at least Joseph and
John participated. (According to the plaintiff, Norman, who graduated in
medicine from the University of
Sydney in the mid-1940s, did not assist in the
family business whilst he was at school or at university.) However, from his
early
teens the plaintiff helped his father and mother in the family business.
The plaintiff attended the Marist Brothers College at North
Sydney, which was
located reasonably close to the family business. After school the plaintiff
worked each day in the business until
the family repaired home for their
evening meal.
<P>

15   	After leaving school at the age of fifteen the plaintiff
worked full-time in the family business for the next three years.
That work,
according to the plaintiff, was long, hard, and labour intensive. The plaintiff
was not paid any wages for his work in
the family business. However, he
received pocket money from his father. When the plaintiff commenced working in
the business full-time
he raised with his father the question of receiving a
wage, and his father responded, "If you want money for your use, you just ask
me. What you do for me you do for yourself, and what's mine is yours". These
sentiments were repeated by Giovanni to the plaintiff
on many occasions, and it
was the understanding of the plaintiff that eventually, upon the death of his
parents, their assets would
be shared equally between himself and his two
brothers.
<P>

16   	In about 1943 (when he was aged about 18) the plaintiff
obtained an apprenticeship in the engineering trade. He was thenceforward
in
full-time employment, attending a technical college course in the evening, and
continuing to work in the family business on weekends
and when he was not in
his employment or attending his trade course. The plaintiff still did not
receive any pay for the work which
he did in the family business.
<P>

17   	In about 1947 Giovanni had acquired as the family home a
house property at 2 Ross Street, Seaforth. At about the same time
Giovanni also
purchased the adjoining property, known as Lot B, Ross Street, Seaforth (which
latter property constitutes one of the
assets in the estate of the deceased).

<P>

18   	Whilst serving his apprenticeship the plaintiff, in
addition to assisting in the family business, also used the skills which
he had
acquired in his apprenticeship in servicing and maintaining the vehicles (both
those used in the business and those for private
use) owned by his father. As
the plaintiff pointed out in his affidavit evidence, since that activity took
place during wartime,
motor mechanics were usually difficult to find, and when
they were available they were unreliable. 
<P>

19   	In his last employed position, with Precision Metal
Stampings, the plaintiff attained the position of tool room foreman. 
<P>

20   	In about 1954 the plaintiff commenced in full-time
business for himself. He did, however, continue to help in the family business
after work and at weekends. Even after his marriage on 11 January 1956 the
plaintiff continued to maintain the house at 2 Ross Street,
Seaforth, in which
his parents were then residing.
<P>

21   	At that time Joseph was still working full-time in the
family business (in the capacity, according to the plaintiff, of "a
partner").
Norman was practising as a general medical practitioner from various locations
on the Northern Beaches.
<P>

22   	Giovanni died on 1 January 1969. Probate of Giovanni's
will dated 6 November 1968 was granted to the plaintiff (being one
of the
executors named therein, the other executor having renounced Probate). By that
will Giovanni released and forgave any debts
owing to him by any of his sons.
He gave the residue of his estate on trust to pay the income to his wife Anna
and to his son Norman
and to the survivor of them, and thereafter to his
grandchildren in equal shares as tenants in common. 
<P>

23   	In the early 1960s the premises at 304 Pacific Highway,
Crows Nest, from which the family business was conducted were purchased
by
Norman, Joseph and the plaintiff. The business itself was sold in 1965, but the
premises were retained by the three brothers for
about twenty years
thereafter.
<P>

24   	The plaintiff in his affidavit evidence set forth details
concerning the various real property transactions in which his father
was
involved. 
<P>

25   	After the death of Giovanni, the deceased and Norman (who
was unmarried) lived together in the house property at 2 Ross Street,
Seaforth,
until Norman's death on 8 February 1986. During that time Norman attended to
all the financial affairs of his mother.
<P>

26   	It was not disputed that the plaintiff had a long, regular
and affectionate relationship with his mother and with Norman.
When Norman died
the deceased was aged about 85. 
<P>

27   	After the death of Norman (perhaps, even before it) there
appears to have been a falling out between the plaintiff on the
one hand and
his brother Joseph and Joseph's family on the other. The deceased was not able
to live alone. After residing for a short
period with the plaintiff, and a
considerably longer period with Joseph, the deceased in early 1988 became a
resident at the Alexander
Nursing Home (later known as Natalda Nursing Home).
From then until her death more than seven years later the plaintiff visited her
at least twice a week. His wife and his children also visited her. 
<P>

28   	Details of the assets of the plaintiff and of various
companies under his control are set forth in his affidavit sworn 28
July 1997.
The plaintiff was cross-examined concerning those assets and concerning the
practical effect of his control of a number
of companies.
<P>

29   	The plaintiff and his wife Maria Mangraviti jointly own
their residence at 82 Seaforth Crescent, Seaforth, which is unencumbered,
and
which has an estimated value of $1.25 million. Mangraviti Investments Pty
Limited, in which the plaintiff has a controlling interest,
owns a number of
items of real estate. It is unnecessary for me to set forth all the details of
the assets of the plaintiff either
owned directly by him or owned by companies
which he controls. Suffice it to say, however, that those assets have a total
value of
almost $8 million. 
<P>

30   	The plaintiff is 73 years of age. He and his wife reside
in the house property at 82 Seaforth Crescent, Seaforth. The plaintiff
said in
his evidence that he and his wife entertain very little, live modestly,
frugally and carefully. They do not waste money and
expend little on clothes.
It is much to the credit of the plaintiff that through his own efforts and hard
work and his considerable
business acumen he has under his control assets worth
almost $8 million.
<P>

31   	During the course of his cross-examination the plaintiff
agreed that he had no financial needs, that he was financially independent,
that his wife was secure, just as he was secure, and their children also.
<P>

32   	The plaintiff said, in answer to a question concerning his
needs, "I have not come to this Court today under the guise of
need. I have
come to the Court as a matter of honour". In the same answer he referred to his
conversations with his father about
being paid a wage and continued,
<P>

Now, I would take that to understand that whatever assets were accrued for my
parents, whatever, that we would share in that, and
that wasn't the case.
That's why I'm here today, for no other reason. 
<P>

33   	The plaintiff agreed that the reason why he had made the
present application was that he felt "some hurt" "because your mother
failed to
recognise in her will some moral obligation which you perceive she ought to
have had to mention you in her will as a beneficiary
to be paid money'". The
plaintiff said that the provision made for him by clause 4 of the will (which
would give to him about $20,000)
would not "cover the efforts I put in for my
parents. It just wouldn't cover it". In answer to the question,
<P>

Is it the position that you are here today before this Court to seek recompense
for what you perceive you have done for your parents
during their lifetime?
<P>

34   	The plaintiff replied, 
<P>

I did it --- I didn't perceive it but I do agree to why I am here at this
Court. 
<P>

35   	The plaintiff stated that there was no reason, other than
the foregoing reasons, why he had made the present application.
He was asked
questions concerning the statement of the deceased in clause 13 of her will. He
agreed that the statement that "he is
of independent means" was accurate at the
date of the will, remained accurate to the present time, and will remain
accurate for the
foreseeable future.
<P>

36   	The plaintiff as a son of the deceased is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, he has the standing
to bring the present proceedings. Indeed, the plaintiff is the only eligible
person in relation to
the deceased. None of the residuary beneficiaries, being
the grandchildren of the deceased, is an eligible person. 
<P>

37   	No evidence was placed before the Court concerning the
financial and material circumstances of any of the grandchildren or
concerning
the beneficiaries in Joseph's estate (apart from some information given by the
plaintiff under cross-examination concerning
the occupations of his two
unmarried children, Margaret and Anthony, and the shareholding of his children
in Mangraviti Investments
Pty Limited). Accordingly, the Court, when
considering any competing claims upon the bounty of the deceased, is entitled
to infer
that the financial and material circumstances of the grandchildren (or
of any of them) or of the beneficiaries of Joseph are not
such as would have
the effect of reducing, or even extinguishing, any order for provision an
entitlement to which the plaintiff might
otherwise have established. 
<P>

38   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that whilst he
has substantial assets, the cash proportion of those assets is
modest. The
plaintiff and his wife subsist by drawing capital, by way of repayment of
moneys lent to Mangraviti Investments Pty Limited,
such moneys being fully
expended by the plaintiff and his wife on current living expenses. 
<P>

39   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that clause 13
of the will manifested a misconception in the mind of the deceased
as to the
benefits which had, in fact, been conferred on the plaintiff during the
lifetime of the deceased, to the extent that that
statement asserted that
adequate provision had been made for the plaintiff during his lifetime.
Further, that it was clear that the
deceased herself had not personally
conferred any benefits upon the plaintiff during her lifetime. It was submitted
that an examination
of the will itself reveals an internal inconsistency, when
the provisions of clause 13 are compared with the gifts actually made,
since,
under the terms of clause 4 the plaintiff will receive an amount of only about
$20,000.
<P>

40   	The first stage in the two-stage process described by the
High Court of Australia in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> at
208-209 (per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ) requires a determination of whether
the provision (if any) made for the plaintiff
was "inadequate for [his or her]
proper maintenance, education, and advancement in life". Their Honours referred
to the explanation
of the difference between "adequate" and "proper" and the
inter-relationship which exists between "adequate provision" and "proper
maintenance" etc in <i>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd </i>[1938] AC 476 (see,
also, <i>Wentworth v Wentworth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 703</a> at 737 per Cole JA).
Their Honours continued,
<P>

The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate for what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

41   	The plaintiff sought to obtain some comfort from the
unreported decision of Master Macready in <i>Field v Inglis </i>(6 February
1995). Although there are certain similarities between the facts in that case
and the facts in the instant case, there
are significant differences of fact
between <i>Field </i>and the instant case. In <i>Field</i> the plaintiff (who
had substantial assets, in excess of $2 million) had a gross income which was
about $35,000 less than her total
outgoings. The Master held that her income
was not sufficient to meet her outgoings, and that at least for the year
preceding the
hearing, she had required to sell her assets and in part live on
capital. 
<P>

42   	In the instant case there is no suggestion that the income
of the plaintiff (let alone the income from the companies under
his control) is
insufficient to meet his needs and requirements. The fact that the plaintiff
and his wife maintain themselves very
modestly on an income comprised of
drawings from companies under the control of the plaintiff in an amount of
about $500 a week is
a result of the choice of the plaintiff himself. If he so
chose, his income could be many times that figure. It is only because the
plaintiff has chosen to put back into his various companies the income
generated by those companies that he and his wife live on
what can only be
described as an extremely modest income compared to the income which they would
be more than justified in receiving.

<P>

43   	The plaintiff has not pointed to any specific need, or to
a desire to acquire property or alter his lifestyle which is in
any way
thwarted by financial constraints.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff has frankly acknowledged that his sole
purpose in making his present claim is as a matter of honour, since (probably
with some justification) he feels that he has been deprived of the wages and
financial benefits to which he was entitled in helping
his parents (in
particular, his father) to build up their family business and to acquire the
assets which now comprise the estate
of the deceased. The evidence discloses
that the plaintiff was a devoted and dutiful son to each of his parents.
<P>

45   	In this regard, however, it is salutary to bear in mind
the following admonition of Windeyer J in <i>Blore v Lang</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1960/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1960] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20104%20CLR%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 104 CLR
124</a> at 137, concerning the statutory predecessor of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a></i>, being the <i>Testator's Family Maintenance and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants
Act </i>1916</a>, 
<P>

The jurisdiction under the <i>Testator's Family Maintenance Act</i> is to
provide for deserving persons according to their requirements, not to reward
past services. This is sometimes overlooked and
evidence concerning the present
and probable future requirements of the applicant is subordinated to or
submerged in evidence of
past services to the testator. Allegations and denials
concerning episodes in the past are then likely to become emphasised at the
expense of evidence directed to the central issues in the case.
<P>

46   	To an extent that is what has happened in the instant
case. The Court is not assisted by evidence concerning a dispute (which
appears
to have culminated in a physical confrontation), which then led to criminal
proceedings, between the plaintiff and his nephew
Michael (a son of Joseph and
a grandson of the deceased). 
<P>

47   	In all the circumstances of this case, and, in particular,
in the context of the financial assets of the plaintiff and the
absence of any
need, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established the first stage of
the two-stage process described by
the High Court of Australia in <i>Singer v
Berghouse</i>. That conclusion is of itself sufficient to determine the present
proceedings. It is unnecessary for the Court to proceed to a consideration
to
the second stage in that two-stage process. 
<P>

48   	Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the summons.
<P>

49   	However, in doing so, I should record that there is no
basis for the suggestion originally made on behalf of the defendant
that the
plaintiff had a collateral purpose in bringing the present proceedings, such
suggested collateral purpose being to deprive
the deceased's grandson Michael
Mangraviti of his benefit in the estate of his grandmother. Indeed, in response
to a query made by
me at the conclusion of submissions, Counsel for the
defendant very properly said that the defendant, in the light of the evidence,
would have difficulty in now maintaining the submission that the plaintiff
instituted the proceedings for a collateral purpose, such
purpose being to
deprive at least one of the beneficiaries of his interest in the estate.
Further, it should also be recorded, that
it was specifically stated on behalf
of the defendant that the defendant does not assert any conduct on the part of
the plaintiff
disentitling him from the benefit of any order for provision an
entitlement to which he might otherwise have established. 
<P>

50   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant, such costs to be
on the party and party basis.
<P>

3.	I order that the difference between the costs of the defendant on the
indemnity basis and the foregoing costs recovered by the
defendant from the
plaintiff be paid to the defendant out of the estate of the late Anna
Mangraviti ("the deceased").
<P>

4.	The exhibits may be returned.
