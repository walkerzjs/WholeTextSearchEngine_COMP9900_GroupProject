CITY COUNCIL &amp; ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:</b>      By Further Amended Summons the
plaintiff seeks a number of declarations concerning the regularity of Deposited
Plan 249417 ("the
Plan")  together with an order that the Registrar General
(the second defendant) further consider the plaintiff's application to
amend
the Plan upon the basis that it contains errors within the meaning of S 195H of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></b> 1919.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff is a property developer.  Malcolm Davis is
the Managing Director of the plaintiff.  He was previously the Managing
Director of Jumal Industries Pty Ltd ("Jumal").  Jumal was wound up around
1976.  The ultimate beneficial owner of all the issued
shares in both Jumal and
the plaintiff is Mr Davis and his wife, Judith.  Some time in the 1960's Jumal
acquired a substantial tract
of rural land in Wetherill Park comprising Lot 1
Deposited Plan 228936 ("the land").  
<P>

3   	In June 1968 Jumal obtained approval for a rural
subdivision of the land following an appeal to the Board of Subdivision
Appeals.
 That approval was the subject of conditions imposed by the first
defendant ("the Council").  The conditions included a condition
that public
reserve space be dedicated to the extent of five acres from Lot 1 of the
proposed subdivision.  The land so dedicated
was to be cleared, levelled and
drained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Council and the balance of Lot 1
not so dedicated was
to be added to Lot 32.  Lot 1 was located on the
north-eastern boundary of the proposed plan of subdivision.
<P>

4   	Jumal applied to extend the time during which the approval
for the subdivision remained valid.  This was refused by the Council
by letter
dated 10 February 1972.  On 3 September 1971 interim development order number 7
("IDO 7") was published in the Government
Gazette.  IDO 7 included the land and
made provision for it to be the subject of industrial development.  The Council
advised that
it would be necessary for the plaintiff to amend its proposed plan
of subdivision to incorporate the requirements of IDO 7.  
<P>

5   	Harry Davis was employed by Jumal as a Project Manager
responsible for its real estate developments.  He prepared an application
for
subdivision of the land which was lodged with the Council on 28 March 1972
together with a plan of subdivision ("the subdivision
plan", Ex C) drawn by
G.W. Toft &amp; Partners.  This plan showed 31 allotments and was prepared in
conformity with IDO 7.
<P>

6   	On 8 May 1972 the Council approved the application.  That
approval was subject to conditions.  Condition 2 was in these terms:
<P>

"The dedication as public reserve of five acres of the land shown as 6(b) Open
Space Proposed Recreation on the Interim Development
Control Map.  The land
dedicated shall be cleared, levelled and drained and shall not include land
shown as 5(b) Special Uses-Roads.
 The land zoned 5(b) and the remainder zoned
6(b) may be left in separate allotments or consolidated with adjoining
allotments.
<P>

7   	The subdivision plan showed Lot 30 on the north-east
boundary of the subdivision corresponding generally to the position of
Lot 1 on
the 1968 plan of subdivision.  The common boundary between Lot 29 and Lot 30 on
the subdivision plan was roughly perpendicular
and created two broadly
rectangular lots.  
<P>

8   	Around 27 March 1974 Harry Davis attended a meeting with
Kenneth Riding, the Council's chief planner.  Mr Davis was accompanied
by Barry
Curtis, a surveyor employed by Peter Lean &amp; Lakenby, registered surveyors.
Mr Curtis was to produce the linen plan which
in due course would be lodged
with the Registrar General for registration.  At that meeting Mr Riding showed
Mr Davis and Mr Curtis
a copy of a control map which related to proposed
interim development order 10 ("IDO 10").  IDO 10 was published in the
Government
Gazette in May 1974.  IDO 10 covered the same lands in the Fairfield
Municipality as IDO 7 however it did not purport to revoke IDO
7.  At the time
of the gazettal of IDO 10 it appears that the Government was giving
consideration to a major arterial roadway development
and IDO 10 made provision
for that development.  At the meeting on 27 March Harry Davis recalled Mr
Riding saying words to the following
effect:
<P>

"The linen plan must be drawn to comply with the proposed IDO 10.  So it must
be drawn so that the common boundary between lots
29 and 30 coincide with the
western boundary line of the proposed interchange.  Lots 2, 1 and 31 will
become lots 2 and 1 with the
common boundary coinciding with the western
boundary line of the proposed interchange.  If these changes are not made to
the Linen
Plan, then the certificate to be signed by the Council's clerk will
not be issued."
<P>

9   	The reference to the certificate is a reference to a
certificate issued under  
<P>

s 327(1)(d) of the <b>Local Government Act</b> 1919 ("the LGA").  Land was not
be subdivided save in accordance with the provisions of the <b>LGA</b>.  Prior
to registration of a plan of subdivision it was necessary for the Council clerk
to certify compliance with the provisions
of the <b>LGA</b>; s.327(1)(d).  
<P>

10   	Harry Davis was cross-examined but there was no challenge
to his account as to the contents of his discussions with Mr Riding
at that
meeting. 
<P>

11   	The Council relied on the affidavit of Kenneth Riding
sworn on 17 November 1998.  In paragraph 4 of that affidavit Mr Riding
said
this:
<P>

"[I]t is likely that I advised on the alignment of the boundaries to comply
with the requirements of draft IDO 10 which was then
imminent. I also recall
asking for the boundary to be altered in order to comply with Condition 2 of
the approval dated 8 May, 1972
to provide 5 acres of public reserve."  
<P>

12   	Following the March 27 meeting, Harry Davis instructed
Barry Curtis to prepare the linen plan in accordance with the request
made to
him by Mr Riding.  That plan ("the Plan", Ex 3) showed an irregular "dog's leg"
boundary between Lots 29 and 30. That boundary
corresponded with IDO 10 in that
it conformed to the proposed roadway development.  The words "public reserve"
were written across
Lot 30 on the plan.  
<P>

13   	The effect of the inclusion of the words "public reserve"
across Lot 30 was, on registration of the linen plan, such as to
vest that lot
in the council; s 340D(1) of the <b>LGA</b>.
<P>

14   	The plan was registered by the Registrar General on 3
March 1975 as Deposited Plan 249417.  As at that date, having regard
to the
provisions of IDO 10, the whole of Lot 30 was zoned 5(b) Special Uses-Roads and
no part of it was zoned 6(b) Open Space Proposed
Recreation.  
<P>

15   	Robert Hussey was the Council's subdivision engineer in
the relevant period.  He was responsible for the supervision of all
subdivision
engineering works and for ensuring that they were carried out in accordance
with Council's conditions of approval and
requirements.  Mr Hussey had the
delegated authority from the Council to make final recommendations to the Town
Clerk with respect
to the issue of subdivision approvals, i.e. the issue of the
s 327(1)(d) certificate.  Prior to the release of the final plan of
subdivision
it was Mr Hussey's responsibility to check that the requirements of Council and
other relevant authorities had been satisfied.
 Once he was satisfied of these
matters he would approve the plan and submit it for the affixing of the Council
clerk's certificate.
 Mr Hussey checked the plan relating to the land.  His
notes, an annexure to his affidavit sworn on 25 November 1998, show that he
satisfied himself that the plan  provided "area of land for dedication as
public reserve".    
<P>

16   	On 14 February 1975 the Council clerk issued the s
327(1)(d) certificate.  
<P>

17   	Mr Hussey agreed in evidence that the subdivision plan had
been approved under IDO 7. This was not in issue.  It was the plaintiff's
submission that it was entitled to have the linen plan drawn in conformity with
the subdivision plan and approved subject to the
provisions of IDO 7. In this
respect it relies on the terms of s 342U(9) <b>LGA</b> as it then stood:
<P>

"Where an interim development order is altered or rescinded, or ceases to have
effect by reason of the prescribing of a planning
scheme -
<P>

(a)	any development permitted by or under the authority of the interim
development order may, subject to the provisions of the interim
development
order, be continued and completed as if the alteration or rescission had not
been made, or the interim development order
had not ceased to have effect;
and
<P>

(b)	such alteration or rescission, or ceasing to have effect, shall not affect
any right, liability, obligation, penalty or legal
proceedings accrued,
incurred or instituted by virtue of or in relation to or under the interim
development order."
<P>

18   	As things turned out the proposed roadway development did
not proceed. 
<P>

19   	It was the plaintiff's  contention that Mr Riding's
request that the boundary between Lots 29 and 30 be re-drawn was unlawful
or
improper.  
<P>

20   	Section 195H of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></b> provides:
<P>

"(1)	The Registrar General may,  on the application of any person with an
interest in any land to which a plan registered or recorded
under this Division
relates, or without any such application, and on such evidence and after such
notices (if any) as appear to the
Registrar General to be necessary, amend the
plan for the purpose of correcting any error in or supplying any omission from
the plan.
<P>

(2)	...  
<P>

(3)	Except as provided by sub-section (4), an amendment shall take effect as if
the error corrected or omission supplied had not
been made.  
<P>

(4)	An amendment made under the authority of this Section does not affect the
construction of any instrument made or entered into
before the amendment so as
to prejudice any person claiming under that instrument."
<P>

21   	The plaintiff by its Further Amended Summons sought ten
declarations.  In the way the matter proceeded only two of those were
pressed.
Dr Sorensen, who appeared for the plaintiff, submitted that the balance of the
paragraphs  identified the factual findings
for which the plaintiff contends
and which would ground the declarations sought in paragraphs 6 and 8.  Those
two paragraphs seek
declarations that the deposited plan contains two errors,
namely, (i) the common boundary between Lots 29 and 30 and (ii) the inclusion
of the words "public reserve" on Lot 30.  
<P>

22   	The two errors are said to arise from a disconformity
between the subdivision plan approved by the Council in May 1972 and
the plan
as registered and from the circumstance that Lot 30 on the plan was not capable
of complying with the terms of condition
2 of that approval.  
<P>

 
<P>

23   	Section 327(1)(a) of the <b>LGA</b> prohibited the
subdivision of land, such as that the subject of the present proceedings,
unless an application in respect thereof
was accompanied by plans and
specifications approved pursuant to the provisions of that Act.  Under  s
331(1) <b>LGA</b> an application in this behalf was to be submitted to the
Council by the owner of the land, or some person authorised by him, in writing.
Section 331(2) provided that the Council may approve of any such application,
or approve it subject to conditions, or disapprove
it.  The Council was
required pursuant to s 331(3) to cause notice to be given to the applicant of
its decision.  
<P>

24   	Section 333(1)(a) provided that in respect of any
application for approval of a subdivision of land the Council should take
into
consideration the size and shape of each separate parcel.  
<P>

25   	The plaintiff  in paragraph 6 of its Amended Summons seeks
a declaration in these terms:
<P>

[T]hat the extent of the disconformity between the Plan and the Subdivision
Plan in relation to the Common Boundary constitutes
an "error" in the Plan
within the meaning of that term as used in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.195H</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act
1919</a>.
<P>

26   	The steps upon which the plaintiff relies to arrive at the
conclusion contained in the declaration sought in paragraph 6 are
set out in
paragraphs 3 - 5 of the Summons. They may be summarised thus:  (i) the
Council's officer, Mr Riding, required that the
linen plan be drawn with a
boundary between Lots 29 and 30 substantially different to the common boundary
appearing in the subdivision
plan;  (ii) this requirement was in the
circumstances unlawful;  (iii) the common boundary between Lots 29 and 30
recorded in the
deposited plan 249417 does not substantially conform with the
plan of subdivision approved by the Council.   
<P>

27   	The significance of conformity as between the plan of
subdivision as approved by Council and the plan as registered arises
from Cl
3(a)(i) of  <b>Ordinance 32</b> made under the <b>LGA</b>. This provided that,
upon completion of the roads and drainage works, the subdivider was to submit
to the Council for approval the
plan to be lodged at the Registrar General's
Office showing the dimensions and areas of each separate parcel and the
dimensions of
each drainage reserve, public garden and recreation space and the
position of permanent survey marks. The Council was to determine
that the roads
and drainage works had been constructed in accordance with approved plans and
specifications (or in accord with any
amendments thereto approved by the
Council) and that "the separate parcels are substantially in accordance with
the plan of subdivision
previously approved".  In the event Council was so
satisfied the plan was to be returned to the applicant with the approval of the
Council noted thereon accompanied by the s 327(1)(d) certificate. 
<P>

28   	The plaintiff referred me to the decision of Cohen J in
<b>Baiada Pty Limited v The Registrar-General </b>(1994) 6 BPR 97500<b> </b>in
which his Honour considered the scope of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195H</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>
</b>1919.  In that case a surveyor preparing the linen plan for registration
left out portions of lots in the belief that road widenings
were imminent. He
drew the plan showing the eastern boundary of his client's land as the proposed
western boundary of the roadway.
The realignment did not take place. The
plaintiff applied to the Registrar General pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195H</a> to amend the
plan. The Registrar General declined to do so contending that the section's
reference to omission extended only to those
things left out by inadvertence.
Cohen J determined that "omission" for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195H</a> should be given
the same meaning as the Court gave it in <b>Dobbie v Davidson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23
NSWLR 625</a> for the purposes of s 42(1)(b) of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> </b>1900</A>
namely "not there" or "left out". It was not necessary to establish any breach
of obligation by the Registrar General.  At p.13,708
his Honour said this:
<P>

"In my opinion omission in s 195H should not be given a different meaning than
was given to it in the section dealt with in <b>Dobbie's</b> case, save that it
should be noted that it is necessary to see first whether what was left out was
something which should not have
been left out. Obviously it is not intended
that a plan should be amended where something is left out which should never
have been
included."
<P>

His Honour went on to consider the decision of <b>Trieste Investments Pty
Limited v Watson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%2064%20SR%28NSW%29%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 64 SR(NSW) 98</a>, a case in which the Full Court
discussed the meaning of "omission" for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a> </b>1900.  He accepted <b>Trieste </b>as authority for the
proposition that "it is necessary to consider what should have been in the plan
in order to see whether it has
been omitted."  The question in <b>Baiada</b>
thus became whether the realignment portions should have been included in the
plan. His Honour considered that although the omission
of part of the land was
deliberate it had been done for incorrect reasons and those portions of land
which had not vested in the
Department of Main Roads should have been included
in the plan. This constituted an omission within the meaning of s 195H of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> </b>1919. 
<P>

29   	The facts of the present case are relevantly dissimilar to
<b>Baiada</b>. Here the plan prepared by Mr Curtis, the surveyor, was drafted
in accordance with the instructions given to him by the plaintiff.
It
incorporated the irregular "dog's leg" common boundary between Lots 29 and 30
in order to meet the request so to do made by the
Council.  Lot 30 was shown as
public reserve land. The preparation of the plan in accordance with these
instructions satisfied the
Council that the terms of its approval had been met,
and a s 327(1)(d) certificate was issued by the Council clerk and the plan was
duly registered. Harry Davis uplifted the plan from the Council on 14 February
1975. He was cross-examined concerning this occasion:
<P>

"Q. When you uplifted that plan there was no doubt in your mind that that plan
accurately represented what the company wished to
have approved? Do you agree
with that?
<P>

A. I would have to agree with that" (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.63).
<P>

  
<P>

30   	The Registrar General registered the plan which the
plaintiff submitted and which was drawn to its instructions and which
bore the
necessary approvals as evidenced by the s 327(1)(d) certificate. The plaintiff
invites the Court to go behind the s 327(1)(d)
certificate and conclude that
the Council ought not to have issued the certificate having regard to Cl
3(a)(i) of <b>Ordinance 32</b> and the suggested want of substantial conformity
between the subdivision plan and the plan as registered. Cl 3(a)(i) is
addressed
to the matters which the Council is to take into account prior to the
issue of the Council clerk's certificate.  
<P>

31   	From the evidence it appears that the Council was
satisfied that the separate parcels shown on the linen plan submitted by
the
plaintiff were substantially in accord with the subdivision plan. Robert Hussey
recommended the issue of the s 327(1)(d) certificate
in respect of this
subdivision. He observed:
<P>

"This is part of the released area where there were broad acre subdivisions and
quite often boundary adjustments were made and as
I said earlier, the
requirement was the final plan is substantially in accordance with the approved
plan. Sometimes in order to match
up with other plans adjustments were made.
Plans were shown where an adjustment in the final plan were agreed to by the
council and
by the plan" (t'cpt 1/6/99 p.34).
<P>

32   	Harry Davis was shown Ex C, the plan of subdivision, and
he agreed that Lot 30 as depicted on that plan was not capable of
complying
with the requirement of providing five acres of public reserve (t'cpt 2/6/99
p.59). He was asked whether there would have
had to be another boundary drawn
or some other land provided. To this he said "I would agree. The council would
be in a position
to make certain requests or demands, yes" (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.59).
Mr Davis also said  "I knew at that time (May 1972) the corner block
shown
between Widermere Road, and the western boundary was going to be dedicated for
reserve. There is always some room for moving
in the final dimension..." (t'cpt

<P>

33   	It was Dr Sorensen's submission that the Court might by
looking at Ex C, the plan of subdivision, and Ex 3, the plan as registered,
find that the latter did not, with respect to the separate parcels comprising
Lots 29 &amp; 30, substantially accord with the former.
 Mr Thompson, who
appeared for the Council,  drew my attention to a number of authorities dealing
with the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 102</a> (1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act 1979</a></b> which provides that a consent authority which has
granted development consent may modify the details of the consent where, inter
alia, it is satisfied that the development to which the consent as modified
relates is "substantially the same development"; <b>John Bruce &amp; Partners
Pty Ltd v North Sydney Municipal Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2055%20LGRA%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 55 LGRA 238</a> at 242-243;
<b>Vacik Pty Limited v Penrith City Council </b>(unreported, Land and

For
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 102</a> (1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
1979</a></b> regard is had to the development as a whole in determining whether the
development as modified is substantially the same as that
proposed initially.
Dr Sorensen submits these authorities are of no assistance in the
interpretation of Cl 3(a)(i) of <b>Ordinance 32</b>. He notes that the
<b>Environmental and Planning Assessment Act</b> provision looks to the
"development" while <b>Ordinance 32</b> is concerned with "separate parcels".
Cl 3(a)(i) of <b>Ordinance 32</b> speaks of Council's determination that  "the
separate parcels are substantially in accordance with the plan of subdivision
previously
approved".  The two provisions are caste in different terms however
this is not to say that no assistance is to be obtained from
the approach taken
in <b>John Bruce &amp; Partners</b>.  In determining whether the separate
parcels in the linen plan substantially accorded with those in the plan of
subdivision I consider
that it was open to the Council to have regard to the
subdivision as a whole. The subdivision plan provided for 31 Lots. The plan
as
registered contained 30 Lots. These changes produced a number of variations in
the configuration of the lots.  I am not persuaded
that the plaintiff has
established that, having regard to the subdivision as a whole, the separate
parcels were not substantially
in accord with the subdivision plan.   
<P>

34   	I do not accept that the request made by Mr Riding that
the plaintiff redraw the common boundary between Lots 29 and 30 was
unlawful.
The plaintiff placed considerable reliance on the following passage in the
evidence of Mr Hussey:
<P>

"Q.  Isn't it the case that notwithstanding IDO10 which was gazetted in 1974,
isn't it the case that the subdivider was entitled
to complete the subdivision
in accordance with IDO7?
<P>

A.  Yes, I expect so."  (p.34)
<P>

"A.  If the linen plan had come in as it was with Exhibit C and the boundary
had been there and the request for the linen plan made
and all the other
authorities complied with, I think there would have been some difficulty not to
release that plan but that was
not the situation.  That was not the plan I
got." 
<P>

35   	The final sentence in the passage quoted above is
significant. In the way this application proceeded the Council through its
officer made a request that the boundary between Lots 29 and 30 be re-drawn.
The re-drawn boundary created in Lot 30 a lot which
the Council accepted as
satisfying condition 2 of its earlier consent. It also served to conform with
the requirements of IDO 10
which was then imminent. It was open to the Council
to negotiate with the plaintiff as to the means of complying with the
conditions
of its earlier approval. The plaintiff agreed to the Council's
request and submitted a linen plan in conformity with it.
<P>

36   	Harry Davis said of the request made by Kenneth Riding at
the March 27 meeting, "In the way Mr Riding presented it it was
a situation
that had to be complied with" (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.58). As noted above, Mr Davis
acknowledged that Lot 30 as depicted on the
plan of subdivision, Ex C, did not
comply with the requirement that the plaintiff dedicate five acres of public
reserve (t'cpt 2/6/99
p.59). He agreed with the proposition that either some
other boundary would have to be drawn or other land provided (t'cpt 2/6/99
p.59). Mr Davis agreed that no official protest had been addressed to the
Council with respect to Mr Riding's request (t'cpt 2/6/99
p.60).   
<P>

37   	Malcolm Davis gave evidence that he had spoken to Kenneth
Riding and lodged a protest concerning the request that the common
boundary
between Lots 29 and 30 be re-drawn (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.73). His evidence in this
respect was in these terms:
<P>

"I said, `Ken, you are now imposing conditions on IDO 10 which were not part of
the approval and I don't see why I should comply
with it'. Ken replied to me,
`Malcolm, if you want the linen plan signed to give to you then you will comply
with IDO 10'" (t'cpt
2/6/99 p.73).
<P>

Inexplicably, Malcolm Davis, who swore an affidavit in these proceedings on 26
October 1998 and a further affidavit on 4 December
1998 (correcting a minor
error in the first) did not give an account of this conversation in either. In
the first affidavit he said
this:
<P>

"On or about 27 March 1974 Davis informed me of all the matters deposed to in
paragraph 10 of the Davis affidavit. I decided that
we should not oppose Mr
Riding's direction regarding the Linen Plan referred to in that paragraph 10
(`the Linen Plan') because to
my mind contesting it would likely cause further
delays in completing the project" (paragraph 12).
<P>

38   	In cross-examination the contents of a number of letters
written to the Council on behalf of the plaintiff were put to Malcolm
Davis
with a view to establishing that no protest had been made concerning the
request that the common boundary between Lots 29 and
30 be re-drawn. Mr Davis
would not concede that to be the case. I do not read any of the letters as
protesting against the request
that the boundary be re-drawn. Malcolm Davis
impressed me as a confident and assertive individual. He had considerable
experience
in the business of property development. I do not accept that any
protest was made on behalf of the plaintiff at the time or in the
aftermath of
the request made by Kenneth Riding concerning the boundary between Lots 29 and
30. Harry Davis, who was then the plaintiff's
project manager responsible for
its real estate developments, appears to have had no knowledge of any protest
made to Mr Riding on
the plaintiff's behalf following the meeting on 27th March
1974.  
<P>

39   	I find that no protest was made but rather, consistently
with the account contained in Malcolm Davis' affidavit, a decision
was made by
the plaintiff to proceed in accordance with the request made by Mr Riding in
order to avoid delay and because the plaintiff
was under pressure from its
lenders to obtain registration of the linen plan at the earliest opportunity.
The plaintiff agreed to
make the changes as requested and receive the benefit
of the release of the linen plan. In these circumstances I accept there is
force to the Council's submission that the plaintiff ought not now to be heard
to complain that the request was in some way improper
or its acceptance of it
not voluntary:  <b>Bayview Gardens Pty Ltd v Mulgrave Shire Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2065%20LGRA%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987)

common boundary between Lots 29 &amp; 30 appearing on the plan was an "error"
within the meaning of s 195H of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></b> 1919 I would not
consider this an appropriate case in which to grant the discretionary relief it
seeks. 
<P>

 
<P>

40   	Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Amended Summons are in these
terms:
<P>

7. A declaration that the plan does not substantially conform with the plan of
subdivision as affected by the Approval in that the
words "Public Reserve" are
written across the area marked as Lot 30.
<P>

8. A declaration that to the extent of the disconformity between the Plan and
the Subdivision Plan as affected by the Approval,
namely the words "Public
Reserve" written across the area marked as Lot 30, constitutes an "error" in
the Plan within the meaning
of that term as used in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.195H</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act 1919</a>.
<P>

41   	It is contended that Lot 30 on the plan as registered was
not capable of fulfilling the terms of condition 2 of the approval
in that it
could not provide five acres of land shown as 6(b) Open Space Proposed
Recreation on the Interim Development Control Map.
It is further noted that the
approval specifically provided  that the land should not include land shown as
5(b) Special Uses-Roads.
 The plaintiff submits that since Lot 30 was not
capable of fulfilling the requirements of the approval the designation of it as
"public reserve" constitutes an error in the plan. 
<P>

42   	I do not accept the plaintiff has established that the
inclusion of the words "public reserve" on Lot 30 of the plan constitutes
an
error for the purposes of 
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195H</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></b>.  The plan was submitted by the plaintiff
bearing the words of reservation on Lot 30. The Council accepted that the
reservation satisfied
condition 2 of its May 1972 approval. Its satisfaction in
this regard is signified by the issue of the s 327(1)(d) certificate. It
was Dr
Sorensen's submission that the terms of the May 1972 approval should be read
strictly. It was not open to the Council to accept
other than the reservation
of five acres of land shown as 6(b) Open Space Proposed Recreation on the
Interim Development Order control
map.
<P>

43   	The Council was entitled to insist that the linen plan be
drawn so as to dedicate five acres of land shown as 6(b) Open Space
Proposed
Recreation. Harry Davis agreed that Ex C, the plan of subdivision, did not make
provision in lot 30 (which bore the notation
"public gardens and recreation
space") for the dedication of five acres of land.  In the event the Council
accepted the reservation
of Lot 30 on Ex 3 as satisfying the condition imposed
by the May 1972 approval. I am not persuaded that the suggested disconformity
between the plan as registered and the subdivision plan "<i>as affected by the
Approval"</i> constitutes an "error" for the purpose of s 195H of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> </b>1919. 
<P>

44   	In any event, I do not consider that it would be
appropriate in the exercise of my discretion to go behind the s 327(1)(d)
certificate and upon the application of the plaintiff declare that the plan
contained an error in that the reservation of Lot 30
as public reserve did not
meet the terms of the Council's approval. There is no issue but that the
Council was entitled to impose
as a condition of approval of the subdivision
that an area of five acres be dedicated as public reserve. The plaintiff
submitted
the plan which made provision for the dedication of Lot 30 as public
reserve. The Council accepted that dedication and approved the
subdivision
releasing the linen plan for registration. The plaintiff accepted the benefit
of the approval and now some twenty-four
years later invites the Court to
declare that the reservation constituted an error for the reason that it
included land not zoned
Open Space Proposed Recreation. In this respect I have
regard to the observations of Bignold J in <b>Progress and Securities Pty Ltd v
North Sydney Municipal Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2066%20LGRA%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 66 LGRA 236</a> at 241/2. 
<P>

45   	The inclusion of the words  "public reserve" on the Plan
operated to vest the land in the Council upon registration pursuant
to s 336(1)
of the<b> LGA</b>. The present proceedings appear to be brought with a view to
restoring Lot 30 to the plaintiff. The declarations and order sought
in these
proceedings would not achieve that result. The plaintiff armed with a
declaration that the inclusion of the words "public
reserve" constituted an
error (if such were found and a declaration made) would invite the Registrar
General to amend the plan pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195H</a> by the deletion of those words. Dr
Sorensen did not suggest that this would operate to deprive the Council of its
title to Lot 30
having regard to the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195H(4)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act</a></b> 1919<b> </b>and s.42 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b> 1900. The effect
of the proposed amendment was suggested to be somewhat uncertain. Dr Sorensen
put it this way:
<P>

"The public reserve point raises the issue, if the public reserve is gone, it
does affect the status of the land at the beginning,
it doesn't take away the
council title right now, but we submit any subsequent dealings with the land
may have consequences, will
have consequences for a subsequent purchaser and
the council is endeavouring to sell the land" (t'cpt 3/6/99 p.98).
<P>

46   	The Council pleaded that the plaintiff's action was barred
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 14</a> and 27(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> </b>1969.  This was pressed
faintly, if at all, in the course of oral submissions. The proceedings are not
a cause of action within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> nor
are they an action on a cause of action to recover land within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
27</a> of that Act. Apart from the declarations set out above the only other relief
sought by the plaintiff is an order that the Registrar
General further consider
an application to amend the deposited plan pursuant to s 195H of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> </b>1919.   I do not consider that the relief sought by
these proceedings is caught by the Act.  
<P>

47   	I consider the delay in bringing these proceedings is
relevant to the exercise of my discretion as to whether, in the event
that
error was disclosed, relief of the nature sought by the plaintiff should be
granted. The proposed amendment to the deposited
plan which is the object of
these proceedings is said to impact in an undefined way on the Council's
ability to give good title to
Lot 30.  Proceedings for the recovery of land
would be barred after twelve years.
<P>

48   	The plaintiff sought to explain the twenty-four year delay
in commencing these proceedings by pointing to a history of negotiations
between it and the Council in the years following the registration of the plan.
It is clear that over the years the plaintiff has
proposed, and the Council has
given consideration to, a number of schemes affecting the north eastern portion
of the subdivision
including Lots 29 &amp; 30. In 1977 the Council approved a
plan of sub division relating to Lots 1, 2, 29 &amp; 30. The plaintiff
did not
proceed with that approval in the light of uncertainty surrounding the Planning
and Environment Commission's proposed road
route north to the F4 extension. I
do not consider that the history of subsequent negotiations between the
plaintiff and the Council
satisfactorily explains the plaintiff's failure to
bring proceedings challenging the requirement to vary the common boundary
between
Lot 29 &amp; 30 and the dedication of Lot 30 in a timely fashion.   
<P>

49   	The plaintiff placed considerable reliance on <b>Baiada
</b>in dealing with the issue of delay.  In that case relief of the description
sought in the present proceedings was granted more than
twenty years after the
registration of the plan. As noted above, I do not consider that case
relevantly similar. There was no issue
there but that the surveyor had omitted
to include the portion of the subject lots which he wrongly believed were to be
the subject
of an imminent road widening. In the present case the Council's
approval of the proposed subdivision was the subject of a condition
that there
be a dedication of some five acres of public reserve. Harry Davis gave the
following evidence:
<P>

"Q. It always seems to have been assumed that Lot 30, or land in that locality,
would be used for public reserve. How did that come
about?
<P>

A. I have not the faintest idea. I have no written instructions. I always
operated under the understanding that the Lot on the north
east corner of the
subdivision was to be dedicated" (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.59).
<P>

50   	Malcolm Davis gave evidence that it was his understanding
that his company was to provide five acres of public reserve on
the boundary of
Widemere Road and the proposed road which is now known as Davis Road. He agreed
that this was Lot 30 on Ex C, the
plan of subdivision (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.71).
Malcolm Davis also agreed that he had over the years negotiated with the
Council to enter
into an exchange of land with respect to Lot 30 and that it
was only in the last twelve months that he had changed his tack and sought
the
return of Lot 30 unconditionally (t'cpt 2/6/99 p.71).
<P>

51   	The Council submitted that the plaintiff was in any event
estopped from seeking by these proceedings to question either the
common
boundary between Lots 29 and 30 or the dedication of Lot 30 as public reserve.
On 11 November 1974 Jumal entered into a deed
with the Council. The deed
recited that the subdivider had submitted a plan of subdivision to the Council
for approval and annexed
the plan to it. The deed was expressed to bind the
subdividers successors and assigns and provided that the subdivider would
concurrently
with the execution of the deed deliver a bank guarantee in an
amount of $180,000 to the Council. This was to guarantee completion
of the road
and drainage works. In return the plaintiff received the benefit of the early
release of the linen plan. The plan annexed
to the deed was similar (but not
identical) to the plan as registered, relevantly it showed the irregular dog's
leg boundary and
included the words "public reserve" on Lot 30. 
<P>

52   	The Council submitted that in the light of the deed I
would decline to grant the plaintiff the relief it seeks since to do
so would
be to go behind the facts as the plaintiff agreed them to be at the date of the
deed. Alternatively, Mr Thompson submitted
that I would decline to grant the
plaintiff the relief it seeks since by executing the deed and accepting the
benefit of the release
of the linen plan the plaintiff waived any right to
challenge the plan; <b>Ableton Management Pty Ltd v Gosford City Council
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2083%20LGERA%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 83 LGERA 97.</a> The plaintiff submits that no question of estoppel
arising out of the deed or otherwise arises. In written submissions Dr Sorensen
notes "No orders are sought against the Council based on a claim of `error' or
at all. The issue for the Court here is one of statutory
interpretation,
namely, are the matters pointed to an `error' for the purposes of s 195H(1)."
This overlooks that the relief sought
has the potential to affect the Council's
interest in Lot 30 and that the grant of such relief is discretionary. Having
regard to
the fact that the plaintiff obtained the benefit of the Council's
release of the plan upon the basis that condition 2 had been fulfilled
I would
not be disposed in the exercise of discretion to grant the plaintiff the relief
it seeks in any event.      
<P>

53   	The Council also relied on s 195J of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act</a></b> 1919. This provision was introduced by an amendment commencing on 1
July 1998.  It is in these terms:
<P>

"(1)	The validity of:
<P>

	(a)	 a plan that has been registered under this Division, or
<P>

(b)	any instrument intended to affect or evidence the title to any land to
which a plan relates, 
<P>

may not be called into question in any proceedings before a court or tribunal
on any ground whatever, including the ground that
the requirements of this or
any other Act or law have not been duly complied with in relation to the
plan."
<P>

54   	It was the Council's submission that in seeking to
challenge the common boundary between Lots 29 and 30 and the inclusion
of the
words "public reserve" on Lot 30 the plaintiff was attacking the validity of
the Plan. Proceedings such as the present were
caught by the operation of s
195J. 
<P>

55   	Mr Thompson referred me to the decision of Stein JA, with
whom Mason P and Meagher JA agreed, in <b>Londish v Knox Grammar School
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2097%20LGERA%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 97 LGERA 1</a><b> </b>which dealt with s 104A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act</a> </b>1979 and to <b>Darling Casino Ltd v NSW Casino

one commences with a presumption that the legislature did not intend to deprive
citizens from access to the courts,
however, provided the intention is clear a
privative clause may preclude the review of errors of any kind thus placing a
decision
beyond review provided it satisfies the principles set out by Dixon CJ
in <b>The King v Hickman;  ex parte Fox &amp; Clinton </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2070%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 70 CLR 598.</a>
Stein JA put it thus:
<P>

The test set out by Dixon J in <b>Hickman</b> is that a preclusive clause
prevents legal challenge to a decision which:
<P>

&#183;	does not on its face exceed the authority conferred by the
legislation;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	is a bona fide attempt to exercise the powers conferred;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	relates to the subject matter of the legislation (p.6).  
<P>

56   	The Council accepted that the operation of s 195J was
subject to the application of the <b>Hickman</b> test. Mr Thompson contended
that by application of those principles it was plain that the validity of the
plan was immune from challenge
in these proceedings. Dr Sorensen submitted that
s 195J had no application since no challenge was made to the validity of the
plan.
I do not accept Dr Sorensen's submission. The plaintiff by these
proceedings contends that the plan as registered does not substantially
conform
to the subdivision plan. Having regard to the provisions of the <b>LGA </b>and
<b>Ordinance 32</b> thereto this is said to constitute an error. I consider
that the subject proceedings do call into question the validity of the plan.
In
my view s 195J of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></b> 1919 operates to preclude the
Court from granting the plaintiff the relief which he seeks in this case.
However, it is not necessary
for me to dwell on this aspect further since, for
the reasons already stated, I do not consider that the plaintiff has
established
that the plan contains any error.
<P>

57   	The summons is dismissed.
