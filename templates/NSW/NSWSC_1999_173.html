<b><u>NO 2034/97 ELIZABETH LUYT v STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT:</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  This is an appeal from a decision of Master McLaughlin
given on 23 October 1998 pursuant to which he ordered that the plaintiff's
claim be dismissed pursuant to Pt 13 r 5 on the basis that it was doomed to
fail as the cause of action sued upon vested in the plaintiff's
trustee in
bankruptcy consequent upon her having become bankrupt pursuant to a
sequestration order made 18 September 1991.
<P>

2	The only question which arises on the appeal is whether or not the action
sued upon did vest in the trustee in bankruptcy and
thereby became property
divisible amongst creditors under s 116 of the Bankruptcy Act or whether it was
property excluded from the
operation of that section by s 116(2)(g) being a
right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation for personal injury or
wrong done to the bankrupt.
<P>

3	The Master held that the whole of the pleaded claim was such that the cause
of action vested in the trustee in bankruptcy.
<P>

4	It is not necessary to set out in detail the facts which were set out in the
judgment of the Master; suffice it to say that the
claim of the plaintiff in
the statement of claim is based, first, on a claim in estoppel or a claim for
breach of contract on the
basis that the defendant bank represented to Mrs Luyt
that it would provide certain funds and failed to do so and as a result of
that
failure the plaintiff suffered loss or damage.
<P>

5	In respect of that claim in paragraph 14 the particulars of the loss and
damage claimed to have arisen as a result of this misleading
conduct are set
out as follows.
<P>

	Arising from the refusal Mrs Luyt was treated by the bank as being in default
of all facilities operated by her or her husband
or both of them in connection
with the five properties leading to her bankruptcy and the loss of all the
properties including her
home at 21 William St together with associated stress,
infliction of mental and emotional distress.
<P>

6	The next claim was based not on the representation but on the claim that the
plaintiff was not responsible to the bank for repayment
of funds which the bank
had claimed from her and that pursuant to its claim the bank took possession of
certain properties which
were hers or in which she had an interest.  It was
alleged that the taking of possession was wrongful so that the proceeds of sale
of those properties were held by the bank on trust for the plaintiff and that
by reason of the bank's failure to account for those
proceeds the plaintiff
suffered loss and damage.
<P>

7	Particulars of that claim for loss and damage are set out as follows: 
<P>

	"Loss of all the properties including her home at 21 William St together with
associated stress, infliction of mental and emotional
distress".
<P>

8	The third claim in the statement of claim is a claim based in negligence but
no claim for damages for personal injuries is made
in respect of the negligence
count.
<P>

9	There is also a claim made that to the extent to which a co guarantor was
released by the bank that release operated to release
the plaintiff from her
liability. There is no claim for personal loss or damage of the type set out in
paragraphs 14 and 19 in respect
of that claim.
<P>

10	Counsel for the appellant states that the guiding principle in these matters
is that originally set out in <b><cite>Beckham v. Drake <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1849/843.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1849] EngR 843</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20HLCas%20579" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 HLC 579</a> at
604</cite></b> in the passage of the judgment of Earle J as follows:
<P>

	The right of action does not pass where the damages are to be estimated by a
immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in
respect of his body, mind
or character and without immediate reference to his rights of property.
<P>

11	Counsel places emphasis on the fact that the word "immediate" occurs in two
places in that passage whereas he says it appears
to have been omitted the
second time by Sir Owen Dixon in his decision in <b><cite>Cox v
Journeaux</cite></b><cite> <b>No 2</b></cite> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1935/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2052%20CLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 52 CLR 713</a> at 721 where
the passage is repeated without the second "immediate".
<P>

12	I do not think that too much attention should be given to the question of
whether or not that word appeared once or twice in
the decision in <b><cite>Cox
v Journeaux</cite></b> and I am prepared to accept that the test is that which
I have just set out from <b><cite>Beckham v Drake</cite></b> which was accepted
as correct in <b><cite>Wilson v United Counties Bank</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%20AC%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] AC 102.</a>

<P>

13	Relating that to the present claims which arise under paragraphs 14 and 19
of the statement of claim it seems to me clear that
in both cases the claim
arises directly or is immediately associated with the claim for loss of
property which it is undisputed are
claims which became part of the property
divisible among creditors.
<P>

14	The claim based on representation is that the bank having represented to Mrs
Luyt that it would provide certain funds to her
is estopped from denying  that
it was obliged to provide such funds.  I should say that there is no pleaded
claim that the plaintiff
relied upon that representation and acted in some way
to her detriment as a result of that but, leaving that aside, the claim is
that
the bank by its conduct in not making certain funds available caused her to be
in default under certain facilities leading to
her bankruptcy and the loss of
all the properties the subject of this claim together with associated stress.
I do not think that
it could be said that this latter claim is not immediately
referable to the rights of property or that it could be said to have arisen
irrespective of those rights or loss of them.
<P>

15	The claim in paragraph 19 which relies on the bank taking action to obtain
possession which it was not contractually entitled
to do seems to me to fall
within precisely the same compass. What is claimed as a result of the wrongful
action is that the plaintiff
lost all the properties including her home and
together with that suffered associated stress and infliction of mental and
emotional
distress. That claim could only arise as a result of the claimed
interference with the rights of the plaintiff to the property which
she says
should not have been taken from her and could not be thought to have arisen
independently of that.
<P>

16	<b><cite>Cox v Journeaux</cite></b> has been followed in the Court of Appeal
in this State in <b><cite>Mannigel v Hewlett-Phelps</cite></b><i>
</i>unreported 12 June 1991, although it is proper to say that there was in
that case an admitted fact as to the connection of the causes
of action: it has
also been followed by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in
<b><cite>Bryant v. Commonwealth  Bank</cite> </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1977%2075%20FCR%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1977 75 FCR 544</a> where the
principles are clearly set out and no different decision come to; in other
words the question is whether the damages are
consequential UPON and
immediately consequential or connected with the major claim for loss of
property. 
<P>

17	In my view it is clear that they are immediately connected and this claim
could not arise without reference to the claimed loss
of the property.
<P>

18	In those circumstances the decision of the learned Master was correct and
the appeal should be dismissed with costs. The orders
are that the appeal from
the Master be dismissed with costs.
