<b><u>70002/97  -  REGINA  v  MICHAEL PATSALIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70200/97  -  REGINA  v  ALEXIOS SPATHIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT  (Re Propensity Evidence)  [No 4]</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 12 April 1996, Mr Patsalis handed the
police at Bankstown a statement which he had prepared.  The statement described
the circumstances
in which he had become indebted to Mr Spathis, his
co-accused.  The Crown seeks to rely upon that statement.
<P>

<b>The Objection of Mr Patsalis</b>
<P>

2  	Objection is taken on behalf of Mr Patsalis to the use of this
material.  There are three grounds:
<P>

&#183;	First, that the police came into possession of the statement improperly,
in that they failed to warn Mr Patsalis.  I have
dealt with that objection
(<b><i>R v Patsalis &amp; Spathis [No 3]</i></b>).  I found no impropriety.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, the statement offends against the Tendency Rule (s97 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act 1995</a>).  It discloses other criminal offences, or discreditable behaviour.
It has no other relevance.  It is prejudicial.  Alternatively,
if it does have
relevance, it is insubstantial, and should be excluded <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s97(1)(b)</a>, s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">101</a>(2),
s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">135</a>(a), s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>).
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, the accused was asked to read his statement during the course
of the electronic interview (the ERISP).  Even were
the statement admitted, his
reading of it should be excluded, as a matter of discretion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s137).</a>
<P>

3  	I will deal, in this judgment, with the second and third
issues.
<P>

<b>The Crown Case</b>
<P>

4  	Mr Patsalis gave a lengthy interview to the police (as did Mr
Spathis).  He described the stabbing and robbing of the deceased.
 It is
convenient to reproduce a passage from the judgment in the joint trial
application (<b><i>R v Patsalis &amp; Spathis [No 1]</i></b>), which describes
the separate phases of the alleged crime in these terms:
<P>

&#183;	"First, there was what might be termed a preparation phase.
Arrangements were made to meet the deceased at Bankstown.  A
number of
purchases were made beforehand (two pairs of gloves, two knives, a tarpaulin
and one tin of petrol).
<P>

&#183;	Second, having met the deceased, two vehicles were then driven from
Bankstown to the Marrickville RSL.  Mr Spathis was in
his car.  Mr Patsalis was
a passenger in the truck driven by Mr Ludwig.
<P>

&#183;	Third, once at Marrickville, Mr Spathis parked his car.  He then entered
the truck, sitting alongside Mr Ludwig, with Mr
Patsalis on the other side,
nearest the door.  Mr Spathis then drove to Botany.
<P>

&#183;	Fourth, at some point the vehicle parked by the side of the road at
Botany.  Whilst parked, Mr Ludwig was stabbed.  Each
accused blames the other.
Each asserts ignorance of the sinister purpose of the other.  Both acknowledge
that money was removed from
Mr Ludwig's jacket after the stabbing.
<P>

&#183;	Fifth, Mr Spathis then drove back to Marrickville with Mr Patsalis as a
passenger.  Mr Patsalis then alighted.  He thereafter
drove Mr Spathis'
vehicle.  Mr Patsalis was covered with blood.  The car seat was protected by
the plastic tarpaulin purchased earlier
in the day.
<P>

&#183;	Sixth, the two vehicles then drove to Terry Hills, although by a
circuitous route.  At Terry Hills the body was removed from
the cabin by Mr
Spathis, and left by the side of the road.  It was doused in petrol.  Further
money was removed from the jacket of
the deceased.  The body was then set
alight.
<P>

&#183;	Seventh, the vehicles then left the scene, although in circumstances
which were somewhat chaotic.  The burning of the body,
and the rapid exit from
the area, were witnessed by the occupants of a number of vehicles which were in
the area.
<P>

&#183;	Eighth, the vehicles proceeded to Mr Patsalis' flat at Homebush.  Mr
Spathis was driving the truck, and Mr Patsalis Mr Spathis'
car.  Having met at
Homebush, the two vehicles were then driven to Chester Hill where the truck was
set alight.  Mr Patsalis placed
his blood stained clothes inside the truck, so
that they were also destroyed."
<P>

5  	The description of these matters is common to both interviews.
The difference between the two accounts is in the role each accused
assigns to
himself, and his co-accused.  Each seeks to explain his complicity, upon the
basis of ignorance of the true purpose of
the other before the deceased was
stabbed, and threats made by the other after the stabbing had taken place.
<P>

6  	The Crown puts its case against each accused upon three bases,
namely:
<P>

&#183;	First, that either Mr Patsalis, or Mr Spathis, or both, stabbed the
deceased.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, there was a joint criminal enterprise between Mr Patsalis and
Mr Spathis.  The act of stabbing Mr Ludwig was within
the scope of that
enterprise.  Accordingly, were the jury to decide that one only physically
stabbed Mr Ludwig, the other should
also be fixed with responsibility.  Were
the jury undecided as to who physically stabbed Mr Ludwig, both should, upon
this basis,
share responsibility.
<P>

<b>&#183;	</b>Thirdly (and in the alternative), since the robbery occurred in
circumstances which satisfy <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s98.html" class="autolink_findacts">s98</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, and the wounding or
infliction of grievous bodily harm was within the contemplation of both
accused, the felony/murder rule would
apply to make each responsible for Mr
Ludwig's death.
<P>

<b>The Statement of Mr Patsalis</b>
<P>

7  	The statement handed by Mr Patsalis to the Bankstown police, to
which objection is now taken, contains Mr Patsalis' account
of the background
to Mr Ludwig's murder.
<P>

8  	The statement is quite long.  Only certain passages are objected
to.  It is important, however, to see those passages in context.
 Reproduced
below are the first several pages of the statement.  The words objected to are
underlined.
<P>

"I, Michael Patsalis of 19 Woodbine Street, Yagoona, had organised a buy
between Peter and Alexios Spathis of a large ship of cigarettes
on, on the 11th
of the 4th, 1996, the exact amount being of 58 and a half thousand dollars.  Mr
Spathis of 18 St Paul Street, Randwick,
then planned that he and his uncle from
Ashfield could supply any amount of cigarettes that Peter would require.  
<P>

Chain of Events.
<P>

I met Peter, his surname I do not know, at a gambling establishment at 12B
Restwell Parade, Bankstown, owned by John Hounitous.
 He supplied him with
cigarettes and vending machines 3 to 4 months ago.  In the meantime I had
occurred a substantial debt to Mr
Spathis, Alex, of about $16,500.  I was
buying cigarettes for him and his uncle from a man called Tom, an Asian fellow.
Alex's uncle
had given him an amount around the $5000 to make a purchase.
<u>This was to offset events that led to Peter being murdered.</u>  For Alex
had invested a large sum of money obtained from his savings with his fiancee
girlfriend without her knowledge, also borrowings
from his father, sister and
other relatives.  In short, all the money that was borrowed was to be invested
in buying cheap cigarettes
and reselling them at a greater profit to his uncle
and other associates.  We were ripped off.
<P>

Note, initially, I had a debt to Alex of about $5500 <u>by the fact that I lied
to him in that his licence driver's was cancelled and that I could get him a
new licence</u>.  This <u>caper</u> proved very costly to Alex because he had
used some of the money that he and Elizabeth had saved to purchase a home.  He
could not
afford to tell her that he had just lost $5500.  He approached me on
several occasions up at the Three Swallows Hotel and explicitly
told me that he
would make sure that I had some sort of accident unless that money was returned
to him quickly so as, so as Elizabeth
nor his parents would find out.  I would
- I could see the, the desperation on his face.  I felt real remorse about what
I had done
for I used that money that I had obtained off him to gamble with.  I
was getting deeper and deeper in debt to him <u>by devising a plan that I was
to gain some form of compensation from the government.  I went to him and
showed him part of my bankbook
which stated that I had received a payment of
$705,000.  In actual fact it was a mistake by the bank.  He believed that I had
this
money in the term deposit for I had forged a letter from my solicitor, Mr
Coustas, stating that we went to court and we were awarded
$570,000 of the
705,000 and was, and was due to get this amount around February of 1996.  The
reason I did this was to gain</u> some more money from him, ie $5000 so as I
could go to the races, Rosehill racecourse and win back the money so as I could
pay him
back in full.  Unfortunately for me and him I could not win and lost
the lot on the same day.  This made my situation worse.  I was
now in debt to
him for $10,500.  I started to borrow money from others to try and get myself
out of debt.  I kept on getting deeper
and deeper into debt.  I lied to people
to obtain money so as I could win it back and get him off my back for he had
threatened to
kill me unless I was able to pay him back.  As he said, `I no
longer have a life.  You have destroyed me.  If Elizabeth finds out
that I lost
the $10,500 she will never be able to trust me again.'  He said that if I was
able to get the money back to him within
3 months everything would be fine.  I
met up with a fellow by the name of Tom at the sports club.  He sold me about
$500 worth of
cigarettes.  I told this to Alex, the real worth being $1700.  He
said that he would be able to get a large amount for that price,
ie $27 a
carton and sell them elsewhere and make a profit.  I said I could deal for him
and Tom.  Tom convinced us both that he could
supply us for whatever we wanted.
Both Alex and myself invested a large sum of money.  Tom took the money and we
have never seen
him since, that being $6000.  Alex blamed me and added this
amount on to my bill.  He was getting very upset and starting to call
me on my
mobile phone.  He would visit my place of residence, that being Arthur Street,
Homebush.  He made a lot of threats to me
and towards my family, especially my
brother Andrew.  This troubled me to a great deal.  I finally told him that we
could go to my
solicitors, Mr Coustas, and draw up papers stating that I owed
him all this money to make it legal.  We went to Mr Coustas and he
drew up the
papers for us.  I heard nothing from Alex for a few days.  This was unusual
for, for he would either visit my place or
he would phone me to find out if I
was still living there or whether I had left.  After a couple of weeks Alex
approached me because
he could no longer take this pressure.  I said to him in
hesitance, remembering what had happened with Tom that that I had met another
fellow by the name of Peter. ..."

9  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s95.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 95</a> deals with the circumstance that evidence is not

admissible for another purpose.  It makes the following provision:
<P>

<b>"95(1)</b>  Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a

<P>

<b>(2)</b>  Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to

<P>

10  	A discretion arises under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> which, relevantly, is in these

<P>

<b>"135</b>  The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:
<P>

(a)	be unfairly prejudicial to a party;  or ..."
<P>

11  	The Court may limit the use made of the evidence, if there is
the danger that a particular use might be "unfairly prejudicial
to a party"
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s136(a)).</a>  The general exclusion applying to criminal proceedings is also
relevant, and is in these terms:
<P>

<b>"137</b>  In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence
adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed
by the danger of
unfair prejudice to the defendant."
<P>

<b>The Suggested Relevance of the Statements</b>
<P>

12  	Mr Patsalis, in the passages objected to, described two episodes
which are  certainly discreditable, and probably criminal:
<P>

&#183;	First, he obtained $5,500 from Mr Spathis by lying to him.  Mr Spathis'
driver's licence had been cancelled.  Mr Patsalis
apparently represented that,
upon payment of $5,500, he could obtain a new licence.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, to obtain a further advance of $5,000, Mr Patsalis falsely
represented to Mr Spathis that he was entitled to substantial
compensation.
The compensation would become payable in February 1996.  To add weight to that
representation, he forged a letter from
his solicitors saying that the money
was on term deposit.  Each sum provided by Mr Spathis was gambled and lost.
<P>

13  	Unquestionably, prejudice attaches to this material.  Mr
Patsalis was, no doubt, acutely aware of that fact when he wrote out
the
statement.  He recognised, apparently, that substantially more was at stake
than the matters which he acknowledged in his statement.
 He denied any
complicity in the murder or robbery of Mr Ludwig, which he had witnessed.  His
denial was the more plausible because
it was made in the context of what may be
thought to be a full and frank disclosure.  His interview with the police, in
the concluding
stages, included the following question and answer:
<P>

"Q245  Because of your gambling problem, did you feel any pressure to comply
with Alex's requests to assist him in recovering the
money?
<P>

A.  To recover the money but not by killing anybody. 
<P>

14  	The Crown did not suggest that the evidence was tendency
evidence capable of satisfying the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s97(1)</a> and s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">101</a>(2).  It
identified two matters which gave the evidence a relevance beyond the mere
disclosure of a propensity for criminal conduct.
 The evidence was relevant,
first, to the relationship between the accused, Mr Patsalis, and Mr Spathis,
and  secondly, to Mr Patsalis'
motive to commit the crime charged.  Where
evidence is introduced for such purposes, though it may disclose previous
offences, it
is not tendency evidence, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s97</a> and s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">101</a> are irrelevant (<b><i>R

<b>The Relationship Cases</b>
<P>

(at 338) endorsed the following passage in <b><i>R v Bond</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%202%20KB%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 2 KB
389</a>, taken from the judgment of Kennedy J:
<P>

"The relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they
may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct
of the accused as
charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of
the history of the alleged crime
for which the accused is on his trial."
<P>

16  	The Chief Justice rejected two suggested limitations upon the
reception of such evidence.  First, it is not limited to those
cases where the
relationship tends to establish motive (at 339).  Secondly, it cannot be
confined simply to the relationship which
is proximate to the act charged (the
shooting by the husband of his wife in <b><i>Wilson's</i></b> case).  The Crown
may prove any act of the accused which is itself relevant to whether the
accused did the act charged (at 338).
<P>

17  	Nonetheless, the evidence must meet the following test:  (at
339)
<P>

"It is not that all evidence of the relationship of the parties is admissible,
but only that from which a relevant inference may
logically and reasonably be
drawn."
<P>

18  	Barwick CJ provided a number of illustrations.  He said this:
(at 339)
<P>

"If the evidence does tend to explain the occurrence, or, as in this case, to
assist the choice between the two explanations of
the occurrence, then in my
opinion on general principles, because it is relevant, it is admissible."
<P>

19  	In that case the issue was whether the discharge of a gun was
accidental, or deliberate.
<P>

20  	In <b><i>Harriman v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20167%20CLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 167 CLR 590</a>, the
appellant was charged with having been knowingly concerned in the importation
into Australia of heroin.  The Crown alleged that
he acted in concert with a
person, Lester John Martin.  Martin gave evidence on behalf of the Crown.  He
was a person with a history
of drug dealing.  The issue was whether evidence of
his relationship with the appellant was admissible, including dealing in heroin
on other occasions.  The Court (Brennan, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)
held that such evidence was admissible.  It was highly
probative of the
character of the appellant's association with Martin.  The appellant and Martin
had travelled to Thailand.  On the
Crown case, the heroin was obtained on that
occasion.  Toohey J said this:  (at 609)
<P>

"Now it is true that such evidence was also likely to demonstrate a propensity
on the part of the applicant to engage in heroin
trafficking.  But the evidence
went beyond that.  It was relevant to the character of the association between
the applicant and Martin
and was admissible for that reason, though, questions
of prejudice aside, possible misuse of the evidence by the jury required that
its purpose be explained with some care to them."
<P>

21  	McHugh J said this:  (at 630)
<P>

"Evidence relating to the accused and the alleged victim (`the relationship
cases'), although revealing other criminal conduct,
will frequently be
admissible because it tends to prove how or why the conduct the subject of the
charge arose or because it makes
it more probable than not that the conduct
occurred at the time or place or in the way alleged.  In `the relationship
cases', evidence
of previous acts is admissible not to show a general criminal
disposition but to show the nature of the relationship between the
parties."
<P>

22  	The relationship between Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis was the
context within which the events of 11 April 1996 took place.  The
words of Hunt
CJ at CL (although referable to a sexual relationship) are apposite (<b><i>R v
Beserick </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 510</a> at 515), describing such evidence as:
<P>

"... admissible in order to place the evidence of the offence charged into a
true and realistic context, in order to assist the
jury to appreciate the full
significance of what would otherwise appear to be an isolated act occurring
without any apparent reason."
<P>

<b>Cases Dealing with Motive</b>
<P>

23  	McHugh J in <b><i>Harriman</i></b> (at 628), drew attention to
the following passage from the judgment of Windeyer J in <b><i>R v
Makin</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281893%29%2014%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1893) 14 NSWLR 1</a> at 18, where his Honour said:
<P>

"... you can give evidence of the commission of another crime when the evidence
concerning the other crime is either a part of the
res gestae in the case
before the Court, or where the evidence about it is so connected with the
prisoner as to explain his conduct
or motives in the transaction which is the
subject of the trial."
<P>

24  	In <b><i>Wilson v The Queen</i></b>, Barwick CJ made the
following comment:  (at 339)
<P>

"It is not in my opinion only in those cases where the evidence of the
relations of the accused with others tends to establish motive
that it is
admissible though that may be the commonest case of its use and the one with
which the reported cases have had mostly
to deal."
<P>

25  	In <b><i>Harriman v The Queen</i></b>, McHugh J said this:  (at
631)
<P>

"Moreover, circumstantial evidence, not amounting to similar fact evidence or
`relationship' evidence, may be admissible although
it reveals other criminal
conduct.  Evidence of previous crimes of the accused may be admissible because
it supplies the motive for
the crime charged or because it identifies the
accused with the commission of the crime.  It is commonplace in trials for
murder
or assault for evidence to be tendered to show that the motive for the
killing or the assault was a dispute over the proceeds of
other crimes or a
fear that the victim would inform on the accused in relation to other
crimes."
<P>

<b>Application of these Principles</b>
<P>

26  	I should make a number of preliminary remarks.  First, in this
case, unlike many cases, there is no question concerning the
cogency of the
evidence.  The description of the relationship between Mr Patsalis and Mr
Spathis was provided by Mr Patsalis himself.
 Secondly, it is important that
the statement represents Mr Patsalis' appreciation of matters relevant to the
murder of Mr Ludwig.
 It is, as he describes, "a chain of events".  Thirdly,
although the cases speak of the relationship between the accused and the
victim, the same principle applies between an accused and a co-accused, where
it is suggested that the parties were acting in concert.
 The relationship
between the parties may assist in determining whether they had reached an
understanding or arrangement amounting
to an agreement to commit a crime
(<b><i>Tangye v The Queen</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2092%20A%20Crim%20R%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 92 A Crim R 545</a>, per Hunt CJ at CL at
556), as <b><i>Harriman v The Queen</i></b> demonstrates.
<P>

27  	In my view, the statements to which objection is taken are
relevant.  They provide the basis for inferences that may logically
and
reasonably be drawn (cf Barwick CJ in <b><i>Wilson </i></b>at 339).  They are
capable of explaining the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment
(cf Kennedy J in <b><i>R v Bond</i></b>), or how and why such conduct arose (cf
McHugh J in <b><i>Harriman</i></b> at 630).  Indeed, the material is capable of
assisting in a choice between the two competing hypotheses, namely complicity
in a joint
criminal enterprise, as alleged by the Crown, or an absence of
foreknowledge and involvement, as asserted by the accused.
<P>

28  	Mr Patsalis owed Mr Spathis a substantial sum, namely $16,500.
Such a debt is an unconvincing motive for murder.  However,
here the debt was
but part of the picture.  The picture also included the circumstances in which
the debt had been incurred, and
the reaction to those circumstances by Mr
Spathis.  According to Mr Patsalis, Mr Spathis first advanced $5,500 upon the
basis of
a false representation that Mr Patsalis could obtain a counterfeit
driver's licence.  Mr Patsalis was unable to deliver.  He gambled
the money,
and lost it.  He, therefore, was in no position to return the money.  Not
surprisingly, Mr Spathis reacted angrily.  He
made threats.  The problem was
compounded by further deception, inducing Mr Spathis, according to Mr Patsalis,
to provide a further
$5,000.  Again Mr Patsalis gambled the money and lost.
Each time, to use his own words, he was endeavouring to get Mr Spathis "off
his
back".  Mr Spathis, again according to Mr Patsalis, became desperate.  His
desperation showed in his face.  Mr Spathis was accountable
to his family for
the money which had been lost.  He saw his relationship with Elizabeth, his
fiancee, in jeopardy.  He responded
towards Mr Patsalis with more threats.  Mr
Patsalis, in his turn, reacted by suggesting yet another scheme to recoup the
money (which
was again unsuccessful), namely the purchase of cheap
cigarettes.
<P>

29  	It is one thing to owe money.  Many people manage to ignore
debt.  It is another to owe money in circumstances where the lender
threatens
to kill the person to whom the money is advanced (or members of his family), or
arrange an accident.  Many would find that
more difficult to ignore.  The
relevance of the deception of Mr Spathis, which Mr Patsalis acknowledged, is
that it came to the notice
of Mr Spathis and (as a matter of inference) fed his
outrage.  When Mr Patsalis was unable to either provide a licence, or return
the money, it would have been apparent to Mr Spathis that he had been deceived.
The term deposit expired in February 1996.  February
came and went and Mr
Patsalis could not repay.  He made it plain he had no money.  It would have
been obvious to Mr Spathis that
he had again been deceived. The pressure
exerted by Mr Spathis was, no doubt, the product of Mr Spathis' anger at Mr
Patsalis' conduct,
and his embarrassment at his own conduct, he being
accountable to members of his family for the money.  When interviewed by the
police,
Mr Patsalis said this:  (Q219)
<P>

"Q219  Okay.  Were you scared that you might be killed or injured if you didn't
pay Alex back the money?
<P>

A.  Yes."
<P>

<b>The Test to be Applied</b>
<P>

30  	In <b><i>Pfennig v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d95%29%20182%20CLR%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-95) 182 CLR 461</a>,
Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, included relationship evidence as a species of
propensity evidence.  They said this:  (at 464/465)
<P>

"There is no one term which satisfactorily describes evidence which is received
notwithstanding that it discloses the commission
of offences other than those
with which the accused is charged.  It is always propensity evidence but it may
be propensity evidence
which falls within the category of similar fact
evidence, relationship evidence or identity evidence.  Those categories are not
exhaustive
and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  The term `similar fact'
evidence is often used in a general but inaccurate sense."
<P>

31  	Their Honours then suggested the following test in respect of
propensity evidence:  (at 482/3)
<P>

"Because the propensity evidence is a special class of circumstantial evidence,
its probative force is to be gauged in the light
of its character as such.  But
because it has a prejudicial capacity of a high order, the trial judge must
apply the same test as
a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial
evidence and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is
consistent
with the innocence of the accused (<i>Hoch</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR
296)."</a>
<P>

32  	However, whereas the rule in respect of circumstantial evidence
is ordinarily applied at the end of the evidence (or at least
the close of the
Crown case), and upon the whole of the evidence, the test  should be applied to
evidence which is but part of the
proof offered by the Crown.  Mason CJ, Deane
and Dawson JJ said this:  (at 483)
<P>

".... the trial judge must ask himself or herself the question in the context
of the prosecution case;  that is to say, he or she
must regard the evidence as
a step in the proof of that case.  Only if there is no such view can one safely
conclude that the probative
force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial
effect."
<P>

33  	McHugh J disagreed with the majority's formulation of the test.
He said this:  (at 530)
<P>

"However, I do not think that evidence disclosing or tending to prove other
criminal or wrongful conduct, and consequently the criminal
or discreditable
propensity of the accused, must always meet this high standard.  In the
relationship cases, for example, propensity
reasoning may simply reinforce or
explain other evidence that directly implicates the accused.  In such cases, it
would be contrary
to both the practice of the criminal courts and the interests
of justice to use the no rational explanation test as the condition
of
admissibility of such evidence."
<P>

34  	In respect of relationship evidence, his Honour added:  (at
532)
<P>

"But in the relationship cases, for example, where evidence of propensity is
relied on as confirmatory or explanatory of evidence
implicating the accused, I
do not think that such a high standard is either required or appropriate."
<P>

35  	McHugh J proposed the following test:  (at 529)
<P>

"... the judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the
degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is
admitted.  Admitting the
evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that
the probative force of the
evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair
trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in
adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an
unfair trial."
<P>

36  	In <b><i>R v Ritter </i></b>(unreported, CCA, 31 August 1995),
the accused was charged with the murder of his defacto wife.  Evidence was led
by the Crown concerning
the relationship between the deceased and the accused.
According to this evidence, the accused had, on other occasions, battered
the
deceased.  Gleeson CJ (with whom Handley JA and Hume J agreed), identified the
appellant's argument in these words:  (at 6)
<P>

"... it was argued that the decision in <i>Pfennig</i> is authority for the
proposition that evidence of the kind in question should have been rejected
unless it were proper to conclude
that its probative force was such that it
bore no reasonable explanation other than the appellant's guilt of the crime
charged. 
This, it was said, is the test to be applied whenever the Crown
tenders evidence, for any purpose, which is evidence tending to show
that an
accused is guilty of a criminal offence other than that charged."
<P>

37  	His Honour rejected that argument.  He said this:  (at 6/7)
<P>

"I am not persuaded that <i>Pfennig</i> is authority for that proposition.
<P>

There are many circumstances in which evidence, otherwise relevant and
admissible, might disclose that an accused person has been
guilty of some
criminal offence other than that the subject of the current charge.  For
example, if a person is accused of committing
a crime which is said to have
occurred within a prison, evidence about the circumstances of the alleged
offence will almost certainly
reveal that the accused is a convicted criminal.
Depending upon the case, it might also reveal the crime of which the accused
had
been previously convicted.  Again, an account of the history of an alleged
offence might incidentally reveal the commission by the
accused of other
offences.  For example, in seeking to prove that an accused has engaged in a
money laundering transaction, the Crown
may tender evidence which reveals that,
shortly before the transaction took place, the accused had come into possession
of a large
amount of cash as a result of an illegal drug deal.  To take another
example, it may be material to a charge that an accused person
had attempted to
bribe a police officer to prove that the accused had previously committed, or
had told the police officer he had
committed, an offence which he did not want
investigated.
<P>

It can hardly be the case that, in the two examples just given, the evidence
which reveals the commission of another offence is
only admissible if it bears
no reasonable explanation other than the accused's guilt of the offence of
money laundering, or attempted
bribery.  In most cases of the kind mentioned,
the evidence in question would not satisfy that test."
<P>

38  	<b><i>Pfennig</i></b> was a case which concerned similar fact
evidence, as the opening words of the majority judgment make plain.  Gleeson CJ
said this:
 (p 7)
<P>

"In the two examples mentioned above, the evidence in question was not
propensity or similar fact evidence.  The evidence of drug
dealing would not
establish a propensity to engage in money laundering, and the evidence of
previous criminal behaviour would not
establish a propensity to bribe police
officers.  Nor is there any similarity between the offences disclosed and the
offences charged.
<P>

Similarly, in the present case the evidence in question was not led on the
basis that it was propensity or similar fact evidence.
 It was led, in
conformity with the decision of the High Court in <i>Wilson</i>, on the basis
that it tended to establish matters relevant to the relationship between the
appellant and the deceased.  There is
nothing in <i>Pfennig</i> which suggests
that the High Court was setting out to overrule or qualify <i>Wilson</i>.
Indeed, it may be remarked that, if <i>Pfennig</i> is authority for the
proposition relied upon by senior counsel for the appellant in this appeal,
then <i>Wilson</i> would seem to have been wrongly decided."
<P>

39  	On the basis of this authority, I will deal with the admission
of the evidence, applying the ordinary test.  The Crown must
demonstrate its
relevance, which I believe it has.  It is not necessary that the evidence meet
the more rigorous standard suggested
in <b><i>Pfennig</i></b>, namely that
before it can be admitted, there must be no reasonable view of the evidence
that is consistent with the innocence of
the accused.
<P>

<b>Discretions Under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>
<P>

40  	I turn, then, to the discretions arising under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a>, s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">136</a> and
s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>.  It is convenient to deal with the issues under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">s136(a)</a> first.  There is
a danger that the jury may resort to what has been termed "propensity
reasoning" (that, because Mr Patsalis has
admitted to deception, and forgery,
he has a criminal disposition, and, is therefore guilty of the crime charged).
Such reasoning
would be unfairly prejudicial to Mr Patsalis.  Were the evidence
admitted, I would propose to warn the jury that they must not resort
to such
reasoning.  I would also propose to identify the use which they may make of the
evidence.  It may be used as evidence relevant
to the issue of motive (whether
Mr Patsalis had a motive to murder or rob Mr Ludwig, or join in a joint
criminal enterprise to do
so), and the nature of the relationship between Mr
Spathis and Mr Patsalis.
<P>

41  	The evidence, in my view, has substantial probative value.  Were
the directions given, which I propose, I do not believe that
the probative
value would be substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence would
be unfairly prejudicial to Mr Patsalis
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s135(a))</a> (<b><i>R v Lockyer</i></b>,
Hunt CJ at CL, 11 October 1996).  Nor, for the same reasons, do I believe I
should refuse to admit the evidence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s137.</a>
<P>

<b>The Reading of the Statement</b>
<P>

42  	I move, therefore, to the final objection to the hand-written
statement.  During the electronic interview, Mr Patsalis' attention
was drawn
to that document.  The interview was in these terms:
<P>

"Q21.	I also understand that when you spoke to the police here at Bankstown you
handed them a handwritten document.  Is that correct?
<P>

A.	That is correct.
<P>

Q22.	OK.  I'd just like to show you some handwritten pages inside some plastic
sleeves.  Could you go through each on and just,
just indicate whether that's
the notes you handed to the police here at Bankstown?
<P>

A.	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, they are.
<P>

Q23.	Right, OK.  Just for the purposes of the, of the audio and video
interview.  Are you able to read tht, read that onto the record
for us?
<P>

A.	Yes."
<P>

43  	Mr Patsalis then read the hand-written notes.  Counsel for Mr
Patsalis made the following written submission:
<P>

"If the document is admissible it speaks for itself and the accused Patsalis
should not be judged on his reading of it.  The accused
demonstrated obvious
reading difficulties, whether affected by nervousness, distress or the
legibility of his handwriting."
<P>

44  	I watched the video concerning Mr Patsalis for a second time in
order to determine this issue.  Had Mr Patsalis exhibited some
reading
difficulty, it may well have been appropriate to exclude this material.
However, Mr Patsalis appeared to read the statement
without difficulty, and in
a straight forward way.  I see no basis for the exclusion of this material
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> or s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>, or otherwise.
<P>

45  	I therefore admit the whole of the ERISP tape concerning Mr
Patsalis.
