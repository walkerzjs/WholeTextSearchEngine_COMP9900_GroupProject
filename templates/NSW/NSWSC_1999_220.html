<i>Monday, 22 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2772/98	PAUL BOGHOSSIAN   -v-   PETER GEORGE WARNER</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> This matter has been referred to me by the
Registrar.  The plaintiff, Paul Boghossian, by summons filed on 16 June 1998,
seeks against
the defendant, Peter George Warner, pursuant to the provisions of
Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act </i>1919</a> (and in particular
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66G</a> of that Act) an order appointing a statutory trustee
for the sale of certain land situate at and known as 100 Adelaide Street,
Meadowbank,
of which land the plaintiff and the defendant are registered
proprietors as tenants in common.
<P>

2   	The defendant opposes the making of the order sought in
prayer 1 of the summons, being an order that the Permanent Trustee
Corporation
Limited be appointed statutory trustee for sale of the subject land, and seeks
an order that the Public Trustee be appointed.
 The matter was adjourned to
enable an expected consent of the Public Trustee to be forthcoming.  Apart from
a totally illegible
document communicated by way of facsimile transmission and
said to be some form of conditional consent by the Public Trustee, no
such
consent from the Public Trustee has been forthcoming.
<P>

3   	No evidence has been placed before the Court on the part of
the defendant explaining the opposition of the defendant to the
identity of the
proposed trustee referred to in prayer 1 of the summons.  In the absence of any
such evidence and in the absence
of any consent from the Public Trustee, I
propose to make an order of the nature sought in prayer 1 of the summons, being
for the
appointment of the Permanent Trustee Corporation Limited as the
statutory trustee.
<P>

4   	The defendant does not oppose the making of the orders
sought in prayers 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the summons, and I propose in due
course to
make such orders.  Prayer 5 contemplates an enquiry and accounting and I
propose also to make an appropriate order which
will have the effect of
providing for such enquiry and accounting to be conducted by a Master.  I shall
now hear the submissions
of the parties concerning the costs of the proceedings
to date.
<P>

5   	[COUNSEL ADDRESSED ON COSTS]
<P>

6   	As long ago as 2 April 1998, almost a year ago, the
defendant was put on notice that if the matter could not be resolved without
recourse to litigation the plaintiff would commence proceedings and would seek
an order for indemnity costs against the defendant.

<P>

7   	The proceedings were eventually commenced by summons filed
on 16 June 1998.  On a number of occasions directions were made
by consent by
the Registrar. In particular, on 26 October 1998 the Registrar made directions
concerning the filing of any defence
and cross-claim by 2 November 1998.  The
defendant did not file such a defence and cross-claim by 2 November 1998.
Indeed, despite
assurances by his solicitor that the defence and cross-claim
would be "filed shortly" (made as late as 29 November 1998), and that
the
defendant's evidence would be filed on or before 14 December 1998, the
defendant has chosen never to file a defence or a cross-claim.
<P>

8   	I am informed by the solicitors for the defendant that the
defendant's instructions in that regard were subsequently changed.
Nevertheless the defendant's solicitors did not have the courtesy to
communicate that change of instructions to the plaintiff's solicitors.
<P>

9   	The matter was on 1 February 1999 adjourned to 9 February,
to enable the parties to discuss a possible settlement.  On that
latter date it
was again adjourned, to 22 February 1999, to enable the parties to continue
settlement negotiations.  On 22 February
the matter was adjourned to 22 March,
being this day, to enable the parties to further explore settlement.  
<P>

10   	The Registrar was informed on 22 November that if
settlement had not occurred before 22 March the plaintiff would be asking
the
Court to make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 in the summons, on
the basis that no evidence or cross-claim had been
filed by the defendant
suggesting defence or opposition to such course.  No such defence or evidence
has ever been filed.  
<P>

11   	The plaintiff seeks an order that the defendant pay the
costs of the plaintiff.  The defendant opposes that order and submits
that the
appropriate order which should be made is an order of the nature of that
normally made in applications under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66G</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>,
</i>being an order that the costs of each party be paid out of the proceeds of
the sale of the subject property.
<P>

12   	The events which I have already recounted, including the
relevant procedural history of this matter, are in my view sufficient
to
justify a departure from the usual costs order made in such cases. Although the
plaintiff foreshadowed as long ago as 2 April
1998 that an application would be
made for an order for the defendant to pay his costs on the indemnity basis,
the plaintiff now
seeks only an order that the defendant pay his costs on the
party and party basis.  I am satisfied that the facts and circumstances
of this
case justify such an order.  I will add to paragraph 4 in the proposed short
minutes the words "such costs to be on the party
and party basis".
<P>

13   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I make orders as in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the Short Minutes of Order
dated 22 March 1999 initialled by me and filed in
Court this day.
<P>

2.	I stand the matter over to Monday 21 June 1999 before the Registrar for the
making of directions in respect to the hearing contemplated
by paragraph 2 in
the Short Minutes.
