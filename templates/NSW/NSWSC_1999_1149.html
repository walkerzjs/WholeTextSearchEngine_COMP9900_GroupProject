<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 5 August 1999 the
plaintiff seeks firstly, an order that the time for commencement of proceedings
by the
plaintiff against the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation be
extended;  and secondly, that the plaintiff be given leave to amend
her
statement of claim so as to join the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation as
third defendant.  The plaintiff relied on her
affidavit sworn 27 July 1999 and
four affidavits of her solicitor, Stephen O'Halloran sworn 9 August, 1999, two
of 3 September 1999
and one of 15 November 1999.  The defendant relied on the
affidavit of Sharon Finch sworn 20 September 1999.  Both of the plaintiff's
deponents were cross examined.
<P>

2  	The alleged facts are as follows.  On the 14 January 1995 the
plaintiff sustained personal injuries while travelling as a passenger
in a
motor vessel that collided with a moored motor vessel named "Mayhem".  The
first named defendant Mark Charles Boyd was the owner
and driver of the motor
vessel in which the plaintiff was travelling and the second named defendant Ian
Drinkwater was the owner
of the moored motor vessel.  The proposed third
defendant is the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation.  The Waterways
Authority
has undergone complicated legislative change stemming from around the
time the plaintiff has her accident.  For the purposes of this
application
only, it is not disputed that the third defendant is correctly named.
<P>

3  	It is alleged that the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation is
the successor to the liabilities to the Maritime Services Board
and its
subsidiary authorities.  In paragraph 8 of the proposed amended statement of
claim it is alleged that as at 14 January 1995
the MSB Waterways Authority had
the care, control and management of the subject waterways.  Paragraph 9 asserts
that the Marine Ministerial
Holding Corporation became the successor to the
liabilities of the former Maritime Services Board and the MSB Waterways
Authority.
 Paragraph 10 sets out the particulars of negligence alleged against
the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation including allegations
that it failed
to ensure that the vessel "Mayhem" was properly moored in an area where it did
not pose a significant risk to other
vessels using the waterway in conditions
of darkness.  It is also alleged that the corporation failed to ensure that the
subject
vessel was properly lit or illuminated so that it could be identified
in conditions of darkness.
<P>

4  	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
In so doing, I carefully observed the plaintiff both giving
evidence and being
cross examined and I formed the view that she was a truthful witness.
<P>

(1)	On 14 January 1995 the plaintiff was in a motor vessel travelling as a
passenger when it collided with a wooden motor vessel
named "Mayhem".
<P>

(2)	As a result of the collision the plaintiff sustained severe personal
injuries namely, comminuted fracture of the pelvis on the
left side, multiple
fracture of the left arm, severe injury to both knees involving the ligaments
of both knees, a head injury with
a right front lobal contusion, internal
injuries and severe bodily scarring.  The plaintiff was in hospital for four
months.
<P>

(3)	At the time of injury the plaintiff was 32 years of age and was self
employed as the proprietor of a florist shop in Mosman.
 As a result of her
injuries the plaintiff was unable to work at all until October 1996.  Since
that time she has only been able
to work on a part time basis.  
<P>

(4)	In June 1995 the plaintiff consulted solicitors, Messrs White Barnes in
relation to her legal rights arising out of the accident.
 She placed the
entire matter in the hands of her solicitors and was guided by their advice.

<P>

(5)	In 1995 the plaintiff informed her solicitors of the progress of the
criminal charges against Mr Boyd.  
<P>

(6)	On 4 July 1995 the plaintiff wrote to the Waterways Authority and the
Police department seeking information by way of statements,
documents and other
written material that might be held in connection with the accident.  Also on 4
July 1995 the plaintiff's solicitor
received documents from the police service
pursuant to an application under the <b>Freedom of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia144/" class="autolink_findacts">Information Act</a></b>.
<P>

(7)	Mr O'Halloran told the plaintiff that he was in contact with McClellands
solicitors who acted for the other passenger in the
accident Brian Smith, and
that McClellands had requested documentation from the Waterways Authority in
relation to the accident.
 Once that documentation was received there would be
a sharing of facts and information.  The plaintiff was content with this
arrangement
in view of her concern about her potential liability to pay costs.

<P>

(8)	On 18 July 1995 the plaintiff wrote again to the Waterways Authority
concerning the identity of the owner of one of the vessels.
 The Waterways
Authority replied by letter dated 26 July 1995.
<P>

(9)	In December 1996 and February 1997 the plaintiff consulted Mr O'Halloran at
White Barnes.  She authorised him to commence proceedings
on her behalf against
the defendants Boyd and Drinkwater and accepted advice that at that stage there
was insufficient evidence to
justify the institution of legal proceedings
against either the Waterways Authority or the Maritime Services Board being the
legal
entities she understood responsible for the maritime safety on Sydney
Harbour.  During these discussions the plaintiff indicated
to her solicitor
that she was very anxious about being placed in a position where a large amount
of legal work had been undertaken
on her behalf without ultimately damages
being recoverable.  In addition she was concerned about the prospect of an
order for costs
being made against her in favour of either the Maritime
Services Board or the Waterways Authority if these entities became a party
to
the proceedings which were ultimately unsuccessful.  It was agreed that legal
costs incurred would be kept to a minimum.
<P>

(10)	On 20 February 1997 proceedings were commenced by way of statement of
claim against the first and second defendants.
<P>

(11)	On 17 March 1997 the plaintiff's solicitor received statements concerning
the accident from the New South Wales police department.
 After reading those
documents the plaintiff's solicitor formed the view that they were neutral in
relation to whether or not there
was a claim against the Waterways Authority
There was no evidence that the Waterways Authority had inspected the vessel or
that it
knew that the Mayhem had been moored dangerously.  The solicitor had
considerable doubts that a lay person saying it was dangerous,
gave rise to a
cause of action against the third defendant.  The solicitor was also aware that
at that time the plaintiff may have
been unsuccessful in recovering a verdict
against the two defendants named in the statement of claim.  There had been a
refusal to
indemnify Mr Boyd under his insurance policy.  
<P>

(12)	On 18 March 1997 the criminal charges against the first defendant were
dealt with by the court.
<P>

(13)	On 19 August 1997 McClellands issued a subpoena addressed the Waterways
Authority returnable in court.  No documents were produced.
<P>

(14)	On 8 October 1997, 2 March 1998 and 29 March 1998 the plaintiff's
solicitor wrote to McClellands concerning the production
of documents from the
Waterways Authority
<P>

(15)	On 14 January 1998 the limitation period expired.
<P>

(16)	On 15 July 1998 the plaintiff's solicitor received copies of statements
and other material which had been obtained from the
Waterways Authority
pursuant to the Freedom of Information application by McClellands.  The
plaintiff's solicitor having perused
that material was of the view that the
plaintiff had a sustainable cause of action against the Waterways Authority.
In particular
there were statements from Mr Nugent a boating services officer
in the employment of the defendant.  
<P>

The report of the accident dated 14 January 1995 by Mr Nugent said that it
appeared that the motor cruiser (Mayhem) was in contravention
of "Coll Regs" in
that it did not display an anchor light at night.  Additionally, the vessel was
anchored in a channel or fairway
but from traffic usage point of view it was
not considered to be a markedly serious contravention of the rules there being
minimal,
if any through traffic using this course at night.  He suggested that
local waterway maps and signs be placed at ramps to assist
boaters to become
aware of the area which they were about to embark.  With particular emphasis to
speed zones, no wash zones and
any traffic schemes that were in operation.  He
concluded that a master of the motor cruiser JF111M had anchored in a fairway
or
channel and failed to display an anchor light at night.  
<P>

In his memorandum dated 21 July 1995 Mr Nugent said that the vessel (Mayhem)
had come to his notice a few weeks prior to the accident
but he did not sight
any person on or near the vessel during the intervening period and he was not
sufficiently concerned about the
vessel's position to endeavour to chase up the
owner.  However, if someone had been sighted on board he probably would have
made
himself known and perhaps if they had planned to stopover for a lengthy
break suggest that they anchor a bit further west and closer
to the shore line
on the south shore.  The vessel was only sighted by him in the daylight
hours.
<P>

(17)	On 30 July 1998 the plaintiff filed a summons seeking an order for an
extension of time in which to commence proceedings against
the Waterways
Authority.  This was eventually listed for hearing on 30 March 1999.  On that
day the plaintiff's legal representatives
became aware that the correct
defendant was not the Waterways Authority, as they had named in their proposed
statement of claim and
notice of motion, but Marine Ministerial Holding
Corporation.  The summons was dismissed.
<P>

(18)	On 5 August 1999 the plaintiff filed a further notice of motion seeking
the extension of the limited period as against the
Maritime Ministerial Holding
Corporation.
<P>

(19)	The plaintiff has an ongoing disability as a result of her head, arm,
pelvic and knee injuries.  Medical evidence indicates
that the plaintiff has a
30% permanent loss of the efficient use of each leg and will require knee
replacements for both knees in
the future.  The plaintiff also has a 10% loss
of the efficient use of her left arm.  She suffers ongoing symptoms of
depression
and post traumatic stress disorder.  She will suffer both past and
future economic loss.  She has recently had to sell her business.
<P>

5  	I turn now to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a></b> (NSW) (the Act).

<P>

7  	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> Mason P in
<b><u>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 26
February 1998) referred to propositions which were uncontroversial.  They are:

<P>

(1)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60C</a> confers a judicial discretion.  
<P>

(2)	The discretion is a discretion to grant, not a discretion to refuse, an
extension of the primary limitation period.  The court
must be satisfied that
it is "just and reasonable" to make the order for extension.  
<P>

(3)	In exercising the discretion, the court is required "to have regard to all
the circumstances of the case" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 60E(1)).</a>  It is also required to have regard
to the 8 factors listed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)</a> "to the extent that they are relevant to
the circumstances of the case".  
<P>

(4)	Among those circumstances to which a court must have regard are the
rationales for the existence of limitation periods which
were identified in
those passages from the Attorney General's second reading speech that are set
out in the order judgments, and
which McHugh J discusses in <b><u>Brisbane
South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR
1.</a>
<P>

8  	I turn to consider the matters listed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1).</a>  In relation
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)(a)</a> the length of delay between the expiration of the limitation
period and the commencing of this action is a period of just over six
months
until the first application was made to the court, namely 30 July 1998.  The
defendant did not suffer actual prejudice by
the bringing of the further
application on 5 September 1999.  The third defendant submitted that the
plaintiff's solicitor had all
the knowledge he required to commence an action
against the third defendant prior to the expiration of the limitation period.
The
third defendant submitted that the particulars of negligence could have
been drafted without recourse to Mr Nugent's reports.  The
plaintiff's
solicitor formed a view that prior to reading Mr Nugent's reports he did not
have the evidence to mount a successful
case against the third defendant.  On
15 July 1998 or shortly after the plaintiff's solicitor became aware that Mr
Nugent, one of
the third defendants boating service officers, had inspected the
moored "Mayhem" prior to the accident.  This changed his view. 
He was of the
opinion after having read the police documents which he received prior to the
expiry of the limitation period that
the position was neutral in relation to
the claim against the third defendant.  Mr O'Halloran gave evidence that
pleadings often
cover a wider net than the case ultimately borne out by
evidence at trial.  At the time of the expiration of the limitation period
the
solicitor was aware that he was to incur only minimal costs, that he may have
two defendants from whom a verdict may not be satisfied
and not enough evidence
to support a case against the third defendant.  It is my view the solicitor's
actions were correct.  Even
if it could be established that he acted too
cautiously, the plaintiff relied on the advice of her solicitor and cannot be
blamed
for delays - see <b><u>Morton v Jools</u></b> (1992) Aust Tort Reports
81-164 and <b><u>McAndrew v Wyoming Nursing Home</u></b> (NWSCA, unreported 5
December 1997, Sperling J.

9  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60E(1)(b)</a> refers to the prejudice that arises by reason
that evidence which would have been available within the limitation period is
no longer
available.  The proposed defendant did not put on any evidence in
this regard.
<P>

10  	In relation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)(c)</a> and (d) the plaintiff became aware of
her injuries and the nature and extent of her injuries within a few months
after they occurred.
 She became aware that she had sustained psychological
injuries as a result of the accident in October 1995.  In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60E(1)(f)</a> there is no conduct by the defendant which induced the plaintiff to
delay the bringing of the action.  The reasons for the non-production
of
documents subpoenaed by McClellands from the defendant in August 1997 are not
known.
<P>

11  	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)(e)</a> the plaintiff submitted that she only
became aware that she had a sustainable case against the third defendant when
she received
her solicitor's advice to this effect in July 1997.  From her
evidence I am not persuaded that even now she is familiar with the
acts and
omissions of the third defendant as pleaded in the proposed statement of
claim.
<P>

12  	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)(g)</a> the plaintiff has served medical
reports from her initial hospitalisation to date on the third defendant.  She
had acted on the advice
of her solicitor and has diligently prosecuted her
claim.
<P>

13  	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)(h)</a> the extent of the plaintiff's injury
or loss, the plaintiff spent four months in hospital after the accident.  She
was only  31 years
of age when the accident occurred.  She was self employed as
a florist, running her own business at Mosman which she has now sold.
 She has
ongoing disabilities and if successful, her claim will be substantial.  Her
working capacity has diminished and she will
have to undergo future surgery.
<P>

14  	It was not disputed that the plaintiff has a real case to
advance against the third defendant.
<P>

15  	I turn to consider delay generally.  In <b><u>Zegarac</u></b>
Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor</u></b>.  The President quoted from the following passage by
McHugh J.
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.</b>
<P>

<b>In such a situation, actual injustice to one party must occur.  It seems
more in accord with the legislative policy underlying limitation
periods that
the plaintiff's lost right should not be revived that that the defendant should
have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

16  	Mason P was of the view that Dawson J agreed with McHugh J in
<b><u>Taylor</u></b>.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that
Dawson  and McHugh JJ appeared to indicate that it is mandatory that the
applicant negate "significant prejudice" before the discretion could be
exercised in his or her favour. 
<P>

17  	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed
themselves in the following terms.
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

18  	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the
notion of "significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances
of a fair trial unlikely" but concluded that the views of the judges in
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> represented a clear indication that mere proof of actual
prejudice will not dictate a rejection of an application to extend time.
 Mason
P then expressed respectful approval and agreement with the following statement
of Kirby J in <b><u>Taylor</u></b>: 
<P>

<b>"Although attempts have been made to spell out the criteria to be taken into
account in judging whether or not an order extending
time should be made, care
must be taken in the use of such criteria because of the different expression
of the relevant provisions
of limitation statutes.  Furthermore, the factual
circumstances of cases are infinitely various.  The discretion conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
31(2)</a> of the [Queensland] Act is controlled only by the terms of the Act and
the achievement of its purposes, as elaborated above."</b>
<P>

19  	Applying this approach to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)</a>, Mason P held:
<P>

<b>"that proof of actual prejudice, even "significant" prejudice, does not
dictate the rejection of an application for extension of time.
 All of the
circumstances of the case must be taken into account, including each factor
mentioned in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)</a> to the extent that it is relevant to the circumstances of
the case.  If this is "individualised justice", it was what parliament
intended.  Evidence of actual or significant prejudice may lead to refusal of
the application, depending on the particular circumstances
of the case.  In
weighing prejudice, its impact upon a fair trial is the primary focus, as
Toohey J and Gummow J emphasise in Brisbane
South."</b>
<P>

20  	In determining whether it is just and reasonable to extend the
limitation period in this application I will examine whether
the plaintiff has
a real case to advance and whether the delay has made "the chances of a fair
trial unlikely" or whether the defendants
would suffer "significant prejudice"
but I will take into account that actual prejudice, even "significant
prejudice" does not dictate
the rejection of an application for extension of
time.  The third defendant did not establish that it has suffered actual
prejudice.
 It has contemporaneous records of the accident by its own employees
and statements of witnesses.  It has been served with medical
reports
concerning the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities.  However, I accept that
with the passing of time the third defendant
will suffer presumptive
prejudice.
<P>

21  	I have taken into account the eight factors listed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60E(1)</a>
as discussed earlier in this judgment, I am not satisfied that these matters
establish that the proposed third defendant's chances
of a fair trial are
unlikely or that it will suffer significant prejudice.  It is my view that
plaintiff has discharged her onus
and I am satisfied that it is just and
reasonable that an order be made that she be granted an extension of the
limitation period.
 The appropriate order for costs are that costs be costs in
the cause.
<P>

22  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Leave is granted to join the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation as
third defendant.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings in this court for damages in respect of injuries
allegedly received
by her on 14 January 1995 up to and including 13 December 1999.
<P>

(3)	Leave is granted to file an proposed amended statement of claim by 13
December 1999.
<P>

(4)	Costs be costs in the cause.  Leave is granted to the first and second
defendants to be heard if they make submissions in relation
to this order.
<P>
