<b>FRIDAY 25 JUNE 1999 </b>
<P>

<b>50198/96	AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP LTD  v  P A WRIGHT AND SONS
PTY LTD &amp; 8 ORS </b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	At the conclusion of the taking of evidence in these
proceedings, a number of matters were left unresolved and the parties
were
given leave to present further written submissions.  These were presented by
counsel on behalf of the defendants/cross-claimants
on 11 November 1998 and by
counsel on behalf of the plaintiff/cross-defendant on 19 February 1999.
Submissions in reply were presented
by counsel for the
defendants/cross-claimants on 29 March 1999.  Included in that material is an
application for leave to further
amend the cross-claim to include a cause of
action in contract based upon an alleged breach of an implied term of
reasonableness
in the exercise by the plaintiff of its contractual rights or
powers.  That application was opposed by the plaintiff.
<P>

2   	As at the time of the filing of the second amended summons
on 2 November 1998 (the summons), the claimed indebtedness of the
defendants to
the plaintiff was approximately $32,000,000, together with interest thereon
from 11 October 1996.  
<P>

3   	The defendants have a common link through the conduct of a
major grazing enterprise centred in the New England district in
New South Wales
in the vicinity of Armidale.  It is convenient to treat the enterprise as one
conducted by the eighth defendant,
Phillip David Arundell Wright (Wright), and
his family (the Wrights).  Nothing turns on the corporate structure made up of
the several
corporate defendants which are Wright family companies.  Throughout
these reasons I refer, collectively, to members of the Wright
family as "the
Wrights" and to the general composition of the defendants as "the group".
<P>

4   	The ninth defendant, Margaret Du Moulin Wright, died after
the commencement of the proceedings and her estate is represented
by the two
sons of her marriage to Wright, Phillip Arundell Wright (Phillip Wright) and
David Andrew Wright (David Wright).
<P>

5   	The principal trading entity is the first defendant, PA
Wright and Sons Pty Ltd, sometimes referred to in the evidence as "PAWS".
 The
Wrights were also interested in meat works, principally boning operations
conducted through the sixth defendant, Melrose Meats
Pty Ltd (Melrose), and the
seventh defendant, Esrolem Pty Ltd (Esrolem).
<P>

6   	There are variances in the evidence of the acreage of the
grazing properties on which the group's grazing operations were conducted.
 The
traditional homestead property was known as Wallamumbi and comprised
approximately 11,850 acres.  The other New England properties
consisted of
Achill of nearly 7,000 acres, Forglen, of approximately 5,700 acres, Yarrowyck,
approximately 6,900, Paradise, approximately
14,800 acres, Woodburn,
approximately 2,650 acres, Conningdale, approximately 2,150 acres, Thorpleigh,
approximately 2,500 acres
and Wards-Mistake, approximately 5,100 acres:
excluding Wards-Mistake, which was a leased property, the collective holding
was in
excess of 50,000 acres.  Reference has also been made in the evidence to
properties known as Glanmire and Greenhills, each consisting
of approximately
1,500 acres.  However, that property does not appear to be expressly listed in
the schedule of properties of which
the plaintiff seeks possession.  
<P>

7   	The Wrights also acquired a north west plains property
known as Boonaldoon, situated some 45 kilometres west of Moree and comprising
approximately 36,580 acres.  It had been sold prior to the institution of these
proceedings.  The Wrights had operated a major grazing
aggregation in south
west Queensland in conjunction with another branch of the Wright family,
represented principally by Bruce and
Richard Wright.  That aggregation,
comprising approximately 120,000 acres, was known as Kindon.  That property had
also been sold.
<P>

8   	Ancestors of the Wrights had been engaged in pastoral
pursuits in Australia since 1827.  The Wrights' V2V stock brand is the
oldest
stock brand in Australia, retained by descendants of its original owner.  
<P>

9   	There is no substantial issue remaining between the parties
on the plaintiff's claim other than that raised by the cross-claim.
 
<P>

10   	By its summons, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd (the bank), seeks recovery of the sum claimed under facilities
provided by
the bank to PAWS as borrower under a written agreement dated 8 December 1995
and as against all defendants under a cross
deed of covenant dated 8 July 1992.
Possession is sought of the Wrights' properties, more particularly specified in
the schedule
to the summons, under various mortgages given by the defendants to
the bank between 1973 and 1990, as also particularised in the
schedule to the
summons.  The bank seeks rectification of one of those mortgages which affects
the property known as Achill.  
<P>

11   	By their amended cross-claim, as presently pleaded, the
defendants seek the following relief: 
<P>

"1.	Damages (including equitable damages) and pursuant to section s. 82 of the
Trade Practices Act.
<P>

2.	         Equitable compensation.
<P>

3.	         The minimum equity pursuant to estoppel as pleaded.
<P>

4.	An order under section s. 87 of the Trade Practices Act to the same effect
as the minimum equity.
<P>

5.	A declaration that the contract of loan between the Cross-Claimants and the
Cross-Defendant <u>is</u> rescinded and a consequential order in favour of the
Cross-Claimants, by way of compensation, indemnity, in equity or otherwise to
restore the respective party in statu quo ante the said contract of loan at or
prior to 30 June 1988.
<P>

...
<P>

8.	Repayment to the Cross-Claimants of money paid to the Cross-Defendant under
a mistake of law and/or mistake of fact.
<P>

9.	         Damages.
<P>

<u>9A</u>	        <u>Damages for breach of contract</u>.
<P>

10.	       Aggravated damages.
<P>

11.	       Interest."
<P>

12   	As to those damages, the defendants claim to be entitled
to a set-off against the amounts claimed by the bank.  
<P>

13   	By the contentions set out in the amended cross-claim (the
contentions), the group asserted that there existed between the
bank and PAWS,
a fiduciary relationship arising out of the relationship of banker and customer
between PAWS and the bank or their
predecessors which had existed "for around
150 years":  that during that period PAWS sought advice from the bank "in
relation to
all aspects of its business operations", advice which the bank
provided and upon which, to the bank's knowledge, was relied upon
by PAWS:
further, that the bank held itself out as possessing special skills in the
provision of advice in relation to financial
assistance to farmers and related
rural matters.  
<P>

14   	It was further asserted that, to the bank's knowledge,
PAWS reposed its confidence and trust in the bank to "behave prudently,
fairly,
honourably, competently and reasonably in its dealings with" PAWS and relied
upon the bank to provide, from time to time,
proper advice, as its principal
banker, in respect of the enterprise conducted by PAWS and to exercise
reasonable care and skill
in the performance of its duties as banker and
adviser to PAWS.  
<P>

15   	The group contended that certain representations were made
by the bank to PAWS "from 30.06.88 until about 1992" in relation
to the
provision of loan facilities to PAWS.  These representations were said to
relate to a "ten-year plan" of PAWS which was described
in the contentions as
involving PAWS in the following way:
<P>

"13.	The ten-year plan involved PAWS;
<P>

(a)	changing its business enterprise from a mixed cattle breeding and fattening
business to an all breeding business by increasing
the size of its herd from
about 8,000 to 20,000 breeding cows by 1993 (or such extended period as would
accommodate seasonal and
market vagaries and the period necessary to market the
progeny of the herd) - hereinafter referred to the "herd expansion stage";
<P>

(b)	         acquiring further rural properties;
<P>

(c)	acquiring further interests in meat processing operations and/or acquiring
a new meat processing operation;
<P>

(d)	securing, or attempting to secure, contracts for the sale of produce to
large retailers;
<P>

(e)	exploring the possibility of entering into a joint venture for the purposes
of accessing international markets."
<P>

16   	The representations said to have been made by the bank
were as follows:
<P>

"12.	From time to time over a period from 30.06.88 until about 1992 the Bank
represented to PAWS that it would support its ten-year
plan (defined hereunder)
by continuing and/or providing loan facilities to PAWS as requested until
30.06.98, in that:
<P>

(a)	it would provide loan facilities to PAWS as requested subject to adequate
security;
<P>

(b)	in relation to loans then in existence, loan facilities that were provided
during this ten-year period and/or requests for loans,
it would not require the
repayment of principal and/or interest other than from the surplus cashflow of
PAWS subject to adequate
security being maintained (loans and loan facilities
refers to all loan agreements including overdraft facilities and commercial
bill facilities, together with agreements to secure those loans);
<P>

(c)	security was initially regarded as adequate for the actual and/or
anticipated requirements of PAWS and from about April 1990
adequate security
comprised a security loan ratio at a level equivalent to a minimum of 130% of
the fair market property values together
with livestock values (which needed to
be calculated by discounting the market value of the livestock to 60%)
regardless of circumstances
affecting serviceability (i.e. the anticipated
down-turn in the cashflow of PAWS during the ten year plan);
<P>

(d)	regardless of any term and condition of any loan agreement or associated
agreement (such as security) contrary to the above,
the Bank would not in fact
rely upon or assert any legal entitlement to require the repayment of principal
and/or interest except
from surplus cashflow as outlined above."
<P>

17   	The advice allegedly given by the bank was particularised
in the following way:
<P>

"14	... from time to time and over a period from 30.06.88 until about 1992, the
Bank advised PAWS that it would support its ten-year
plan by continuing and/or
providing loan facilities for PAWS until 30 June 1998 as requested in that:
<P>

(a)	it would provide loan facilities to PAWS as requested subject to adequate
security;
<P>

(b)	in relation to loans then in existence, loan facilities that were provided
during this ten-year period and/or requests for loans,
it would not require the
repayment of principal and/or interest other than from the surplus cashflow of
PAWS subject to adequate
security being maintained (loans and loan facilities
refers to all loan agreements including overdraft facilities and commercial
bill facilities, together with agreements to secure those loans);
<P>

(c)	security was initially regarded as adequate for the actual and/or
anticipated requirements of PAWS and from April 1990 adequate
security
comprised a security loan ratio at a level equivalent to a minimum of 130% of
the fair market property values together with
livestock values (which needed to
be calculated by discounting the market value of the livestock to 60%)
regardless of circumstances
affecting serviceability (i.e. the anticipated
down-turn in the cashflow of PAWS during the ten year plan);
<P>

(d)	regardless of any term and condition of any loan agreement or associated
agreement (such as security) contrary to the above,
the Bank would not in fact
rely upon or assert any legal entitlement to require the repayment of principal
and/or interest except
from surplus cashflow as outlined above."
<P>

18   	A discrete case of negligent advice was alleged in the
contentions concerning the taking out of loans at a fixed interest
rate by PAWS
between February and May 1990 on the advice of the bank.  
<P>

19   	Paragraphs 28 and 29 of the contentions are of particular
significance in the context of the outstanding application for leave
to amend
the cross-claim:
<P>

"28.	At the time of each of the aforesaid representations and advice the Bank
knew, or ought to have known, that in the event of
its representations and/or
advice to PAWS being false or negligent:
<P>

(a)	PAWS would not be able to complete the ten-year plan;
<P>

(b)	it would be unlikely for PAWS to be able to obtain finance elsewhere so as
to complete the ten-year plan and/or mitigate its
loss; 
<P>

(c)	there would be a disruption of the development of a plan at such a time
when PAWS had inadequate cashflow by reason of which
it would be necessary for
PAWS to sell off land, plant, equipment and/or stock in circumstances which
would be unfavourable to PAWS
in all likelihood; and certainly it would be
likely that the disposal of such assets could not occur in a timely or optimal
manner;
 
<P>

(d)	an exclusive supply arrangement with Coles which was proposed and entered
into in about mid-1990 (with the knowledge and approval
of the Bank) with a
view to Coles and PAWS entering into an exclusive supplier agreement between
those parties with PAWS as the supplier,
would in all likelihood be
discontinued, resulting in the financial viability of Melrose and Esrolem being
in jeopardy and PAWS failing
to realise the otherwise probable opportunity of
securing a lucrative exclusive supply agreement with Coles and entering into
various
joint venture agreements.
<P>

<center><b>PARTICULARS</b></center>
<P>


<P>

	At the time the proposed Coles contract was lost on or about 1 April 1992,
PAWS was about to enter a joint venture agreement with
Cargill.  By reason of
the actions of the Bank PAWS lost its proposed joint venturer, Cargill.
Thereafter, further joint venturers
were also lost arising from reactions of
the Bank those other joint venturers being inter alia Derek Shaw and Bankers
Trust.
<P>

29.	By reason of the matters aforesaid:-
<P>

(a)	On 01.04.92 Coles terminated its arrangements with PAWS and refused to
enter into the proposed exclusive supply agreement;
<P>

(b)	thereafter PAWS lost the opportunity of securing the various joint venture
agreements;
<P>

(c)	PAWS has suffered, and continues to suffer, loss and damage.
<P>

<center><b>PARTICULARS OF DAMAGE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

(i)	Those damages referred to in Mr Cox's report and his proposed supplementary
report (which will include details of the likely
expenditure that will need to
be undertaken by PAWS arising from the conduct of the Bank in restoring its
livestock and improvements
including pastures, sheds, plant and equipment).
<P>

(ii)	Loss of joint venture agreements."
<P>

20   	It will be necessary to return to those paragraphs of the
contentions.  For the moment it is sufficient to note that particulars
of
damage provided by the group did not extend to any quantification of damages
for lost business opportunities, nor were statements
of evidence filed and
served in conformity with the court's directions quantifying a loss of
expectation case.  
<P>

21   	In addition to causes of action based upon
misrepresentation, negligent advice and breach of fiduciary duty, reliance was
placed by the group, in paragraph 36 of the contentions, upon a suit of
economic duress and unconscionable conduct.  This was said
to arise out of a
requirement by the bank of PAWS to enter into new loan agreements with the bank
after the bank had withdrawn its
financial support of the group, at a time when
the bank was threatening enforcement proceedings and when PAWS was unable to
secure
substitute finance.  I do not understand that basis for relief to be
pursued outside of a claim based upon promissory estoppel. 

<P>

22   	The group pleaded a misrepresentation case in paragraph 45
and following of the contentions based upon alleged misrepresentations
by the
bank as to the effect of changed facility arrangements around 8 May 1992.
Again, I do not understand that issue to have survived
the hearing.  I think
the same fate has befallen a cause of action based upon s 60(1)(b) of the
Corporations Law arising out of the
alleged participation by the bank in the
management of PAWS so as to subject it to the duties of a director. 
<P>

23   	When the matter of a further amendment of the cross-claim
arose during the course of the hearing to include a count in contract,
the
cause of action was expressed in the following way:
<P>

"51A	Further and in the alternative, the Cross-Claimants say:
<P>

a.	That by virtue of an ambulatory agreement ("the agreement") made from June
1988 as particularised in the statements of mr. P.A.
Wright and Mr. David
Wright, the Bank agreed to lend moneys to the Cross-Claimants from time to time
on the basis that, if such a
facility were approved, the Bank would not require
the facility to be repaid immediately but would capitalise interest payments
provided
that the loan to security ratio then applying to the total of the
facilities extended to the Cross-Claimants did not exceed 65% during
the
duration of the 1988 strategy;
<P>

b.	In the course of the agreement, the Bank from time to time did lend moneys
to the Cross-Claimants up until mid-1991; 
<P>

c.	From a period commencing in about mid 1992, in breach of the agreement, the
Bank refused to permit the Cross-Claimants to capitalise
interest as agreed but
rather required the Cross-Claimants to sell assets to reduce the total amount
then owed by the Cross-Claimants
to the Bank; 
<P>

d.	As a result of the breach, the Cross-Claimants have suffered and continue to
suffer loss and damage."
<P>

24   	The damages said to flow from the alleged breach were
unquantified.  At the time that application was made, senior counsel
for the
group submitted that the amendment would not involve any further factual
material other than that which had been the subject
of statements of evidence
exchanged by the parties.  However, it became clear from closer enquiry of
counsel that no statement of
evidence quantifying loss of profits or
expectation losses had been served by the group, although the particulars of
loss provided
in paragraph 29 of the contentions relied upon the contents of an
expert report which had been served upon the bank and of a proposed
supplementary report.
<P>

25   	Notwithstanding the absence of quantification of damages,
I was disposed to grant an application for leave to amend to include
a count in
contract, provided that the quantum issue could be accommodated without
occasioning undue interruption to the proceedings
or unfairness to the bank,
notwithstanding some reservations concerning the formulation of the proposed
amendment.  
<P>

26   	My reasons were that, as to liability, the ambit of
factual issues would not be materially affected by the proposed amendment,
as
reflected in the assurance of senior counsel for the group that the granting of
the amendment would not involve going outside
the statements of evidence served
by the group.  
<P>

27   	Moreover, the bank in its defence to the cross-claim had
taken issue with the allegations set out in paragraphs 28 and 29
of the
contentions and as at the time of the application to amend, extensive
cross-examination of Wright and David Wright had taken
place going to this
question of expectation losses, particularly in relation to the "proposed Coles
contract" and the joint ventures
referred to in those contentions.  
<P>

28   	Further, senior counsel for the bank conceded that the
bank's attack on the group's case as particularised in paragraphs 28
and 29 of
the contentions would be maintained notwithstanding the failure of the group to
quantify lost opportunity damages. 
<P>

29   	Partly because of what I perceived to be some
unsatisfactory elements in the formulation of the count in contract and because
of the lack of any precise statement by counsel on behalf of the group as to
the extent of quantum issues raised by the proposed
contract cause of action, I
required the group to furnish particulars of loss to the bank.  This was done
by letter of 19 August
1998 which I have now marked for identification 16.  
<P>

30   	It was clear from those particulars that, while there was
a significant overlap with the existing damages claim of the group,
it was
unlikely that the alleged breach of contract losses could be addressed without
interruption to the continuity of the hearing.
 However, I did not regard that
as fatal to the application as the view I held then, and maintain, was that if
there was a reasonable,
arguable case in contract, if at all possible, those
issues should be dealt with in these proceedings, even if that meant at some
stage an adjournment to enable the quantum issues to be properly addressed.
Given the several weeks that the hearing of the proceedings
was bound to take,
I thought it was not unrealistic to anticipate that those quantum issues could
be taken up in the ongoing interchange
of expert reports which included a
process involving joint conferences of experts:  a matter to which I return in
these reasons.
 
<P>

31   	I also kept open the option of granting an amendment to
include an alternative count in contract, other than the one the subject
of the
application made by the group.
<P>

32   	The final application by the group for leave to amend the
cross-claim is that accompanying the further submissions of 11 November
1998.
That proposed amendment was pleaded in the following terms:
<P>

"3.	Further, and in the alternative, the Cross-Claimants say that in the
premises
<P>

(a)	<u>By reason of the matters particularised hereunder, it was an implied
term of each of the contracts (including the security documents)
relied upon by
the Plaintiff in these proceedings that any right or power conferred upon the
Plaintiff would be exercised reasonably</u>.
<P>

<b><u>Particulars of conduct</u></b>
<P>

<u>All and each of the conduct referred to in paragraph A of the written
submission under the heading "Summary of Conduct of Bank (including
representations) relied upon by PAWS"</u>.
<P>

(b)	<u>In all of the circumstances, in breach of the implied duty and term of
contract pleaded above, the Bank acted unreasonably in the
exercise of its
rights and powers conferred on it under the aforesaid agreements and security
documents in that over the period from
about mid-1991 until mid-1996, even
though there was adequate security, the Bank failed and/or refused</u>
<P>

(i)	<u>to permit and/or allow the continuation of the facilities available to
PAWS as at 21st June 1991; and</u>
<P>

(ii)	<u>further facilities so as to fund the necessary working capital
requirements of PAWS</u>.
<P>

<b>Particulars</b>
<P>

(i)	In or about January 1992 the Bank acting through Mr Armitage required an
increase in the price to be paid by Coles to PAWS under
its agreement when he
knew, or ought to have known, that such a price increase would seriously
jeopardise the agreement's continuation.
<P>

(ii)	In or about <u>April</u> 1992 <u>and from time to time thereafter</u>, the
Bank required the disposal of additional cattle in order to effect required
reduction<u>s</u> in the <u>facilities</u> notwithstanding that this would mean
PAWS would have to sell a large number of the breeding herd and/or large
numbers of weaners
before they were at market specifications.
<P>

(iii)	In the period following 1992, by applying a 50/50 arrangement as set out
in the statement of Bruce Hudson the Bank required
the payment of moneys which
constrained the operation of PAWS in a way which prevented it from preserving
its properties <u>and stock</u>.
<P>

(iv)	<u>From about mid-1991</u> despite being within the relevant agreed
security ratio the Bank declined to provide additional funds to provide working
capital.
<P>

(v)	In the period following June 199<u>1</u>, the Bank's continuing requirement
that the facilities available to PAWS be reduced in a way which prevented PAWS
from adequately
fertilising and maintaining the various properties <u>and
stock</u>.
<P>

(vi)	In or about February 1996, despite having the ability to do so, the Bank
did not take over the sale of "Boonaldoon" and market
it with a view to selling
it to apply the proceeds to reduce the debt but rather put PAWS into
default.
<P>

(vii)	<u>The circumstances referred to above included</u>
<P>

-	<u>The determination of the Bank to limit and/or withdraw funding to PAWS
which occurred in about mid-1991</u>
<P>

-              <u>The on-going negotiations by PAWS with Coles</u>
<P>

-	<u>The drought which affected various of the PAWS' properties from time to
time and consequential increased operating costs</u>."
<P>

33   	I have understood from the final submissions on behalf of
the group that the August application is no longer pressed.  The
objections of
the bank to the later application for leave to amend correctly asserted that it
was not reasonable to require the bank's
experts at that stage of the
proceedings to revisit the damages claim based on a case of breach of contract
or to meet an unquantified
loss of expectation case.  However, as the conduct
of the bank from 1988-1996 was under scrutiny in the group's representation
case
and in its allegations of unconscionability, I took the view that the
reasonableness of the bank's conduct in the exercise of its
contractual powers
could and should be addressed in final submissions, regardless of the absence
of a ruling upon the application
for leave to amend.  I understand the parties
to have accepted that course, consistently with the bank steadfastly opposing
any leave
to amend the cross-claim.
<P>

34   	Further, the bank undertook written submissions in reply
both as to the facts and law raised by the group's case as formulated
in its
application for leave to amend.  The bank's submissions are those of 18 and 19
February 1999.
<P>

35   	The bank's submissions of 19 February 1999 criticising
both the form and factual substratum of the proposed contractual cause
of
action are compelling.  However, I think it is both desirable and practicable
to examine the factual issues raised under the proposed
further amendment,
given that the particulars furnished by the group of the cause of action and of
breach, are particulars which
repeat, in substance, the factual matters relied
upon by the group in its representation case.  
<P>

36   	The pivotal point in the group's case lies in the
significance of a meeting of 30 June 1988 at Wallamumbi (the June meeting).
 It
is the group's case that at this meeting that there was disclosed to the bank a
proposed fundamental change to the operations
of the group's enterprise.  There
is no contemporaneous record of the discussion that took place at this meeting.
There is some uncertainty
as to the identity of the bank's officers who were
present.  The bank does not dispute that a meeting took place, but has no diary
note of it.  
<P>

37   	John Peter Nicholls (Nicholls), a rural manager with
tertiary qualifications and experience in rural management from 1957,
was
employed by PAWS as the administration manager for the group's rural
enterprise.  He was unable to attend the meeting, although,
for the purpose of
the June meeting, he forwarded the "May financial and several<b> </b>livestock
returns" for the "assistance" of John Russell Punch (Punch), then a senior
manager of the bank in its corporate department.
 The only direct reference by
Nicholls to the agenda of that appointed meeting was a reminder to Punch of the
July rollover of maturing
commercial bills which Nicholls suggested should be
raised by Punch at the June meeting.
<P>

38   	John Hugh Robertson (Robertson), a member of the
accounting firm of Roberts &amp; Morrow, an Armidale firm which acted as
accountants for the group, was present at the meeting.  His recollection of it,
at best, was sketchy.
<P>

39   	While it is clear that a second officer of the bank
accompanied Punch at this meeting, there is uncertainty as to the identity
of
that person.   The Wrights thought it might have been Peter Meers (Meers), who,
until 14 June 1988, had been a senior manager
in the corporate sector of the
bank and as such had responsibility for the bank's facilities to the group (the
group accounts). 
He had been replaced by Punch in that role, effective from 11
June 1988.  I think it is clear from his evidence that he was not present
at
the meeting.  
<P>

40   	Punch thought it might have been Scott Armstrong
(Armstrong).  He was a manager in the business banking sector of the bank
and
acted as assistant to Punch in June 1988 and, before that, as assistant to
Meers.  However, I think it is clear from Armstrong's
evidence that he did not
attend the meeting at Wallamumbi.  
<P>

41   	Whoever the second bank officer was, it is the evidence of
Robertson that notes were taken of the meeting by that officer
and, although
senior counsel for the group toyed with the submission that there was a record
of the meeting kept by the bank which
had been suppressed, I do not understand
such a submission to be made and in any event, I would not draw such an
inference from the
absence of any bank record of the meeting.  
<P>

42   	Although Phillip Wright's evidence of the meeting was
unhelpful, I place no particular significance on that.  Phillip Wright's
forte
was in stock management and meetings such as this June meeting were clearly not
his long suit.  This may have something to
do with a dyslexic condition of
which he spoke in his oral evidence.  
<P>

43   	By contrast, evidence of the June meeting discussions by
Wright and David Wright was extremely lengthy and detailed.  I think
it is a
reasonable observation to say of Punch's evidence of this meeting that his
recollection was quite limited.  His general position
was that there had been
no mention at this meeting of a ten year plan or of a strategy which involved
the building up of the breeding
herd on the Wrights' properties.  The corollary
to that was that no assurances of bank support of the kind alleged by the
Wrights
were given by him at this meeting.  
<P>

44   	I have had no occasion to doubt the truthfulness of the
witnesses called by either side in these proceedings.  When I say
that I have
no doubt at all that at the June meeting the Wrights disclosed to Punch a major
change in the grazing operation which
involved a building up of the group's
breeding herd from some 8,000 to 20,000 head over a five to ten year period, no
criticism of
the credibility of Punch is to be inferred.  By the same token,
while I am satisfied that the Wrights endeavoured to give their evidence
truthfully, it does not follow that their respective detailed version of
discussions with the bank's officers at this and subsequent
meetings should be
unqualifiedly accepted.  The Wrights do not claim to have exceptional memories
and the extraordinary detail of
the evidence of their unrecorded conversations
with bank officers is more a reflection of the practice in commercial cases of
taking
evidence-in-chief in written statement form served prior to the
commencement of the hearing.  The approach I have adopted to such
detailed
evidence by the Wrights of unrecorded conversations which took place several
years ago is to ascertain the substance or
thrust of those discussions rather
than to accept as reliable the detail of those discussions.  
<P>

45   	In my view, in order to properly evaluate the content and
significance of the June meeting, it is instructive to have regard
to the
banker/customer setting in which it took place.  
<P>

46   	As at 30 June 1988, the indebtedness of PAWS to the bank
was $10,885,000:  not a particularly significant sum when compared
with the
level of the group's facilities at 21 June 1991 of $32,600,000.  Even so, it
represented a very significant increase in
borrowings in the eighties from
approximately $2,200,000 in 1983.  In turn, that has to be placed in the
context of the considerable
asset backing of the group.
<P>

47   	Central to the relationship between the Wrights and the
bank in June 1988 are two principal factors:  one is the unique nature
of a
banker/customer relationship which extended back approximately 150 years, if
one has regard to their predecessors.  The second
factor is the attitude of the
bank to the Wrights as reflected through Punch as the senior manager of the
corporate sector.  He was
not a stranger to the group account as at June 1988.
As a corporate accounts manager, he reported to a senior manger with
responsibility
for the group accounts from May 1986 until 11 May 1987, at which
point he took up the position as manager, commercial banking at
the bank's
principal office.  From that point until June 1988, he had no involvement with
the group account.
<P>

48   	After June 1988, he regained responsibility for the group
accounts until about August 1991, when he relinquished control of
the bank's
rural portfolio while still being in the business banking sector.  From that
time until September 1993, he ceased to have
involvement with the group
account, resuming connection with it with another change in portfolio
responsibilities in September 1993,
by which time, in one sense, the damage
complained of by the group had been done.  
<P>

49   	The view I have formed is that Punch greatly respected
Wright and admired his reputation and expertise as a rural businessman.
 I
think he also placed considerable value on the worth to the bank of the group
account.  I think this attitude was reflected in
an enthusiastic support of the
group's expansion activities which occurred in the two to three years following
the June meeting.
 That was not an enthusiasm shared by John Buckley (Buckley),
the bank's regional executive in its business banking sector, to whom
Punch, as
one of five senior managers, reported.  He did not have direct contact with the
Wrights until June of 1991 and in the course
of these reasons I have found it
necessary to note unfortunate aspects attaching to his involvement with the
group account.  
<P>

50   	There is no doubt that Wright placed considerable store on
the value of the very long family association with the bank and
its
predecessors as the Wrights' principal banker.  I think, with some
justification, he was proud of that association and respected
the benefits of
the financial assistance provided to the Wrights by the bank in that capacity.

<P>

51   	In the broadest of terms, his evidence was to the effect
that he looked to the bank exclusively for provision of banking facilities
and
took the bank into his confidence before making financial decisions of any
significance.  Indeed, it is his evidence that if
the bank was opposed to a
particular financial decision of moment, he would bow to the bank's judgment.
He was confident that the
Wrights could look to the bank for financial support
in times, for example, of adverse seasonal conditions and other vagaries that
beset and adversely affect rural enterprises.  There could be no question in
his mind of the bank calling up facilities which he
regarded as long term or
revolving, regardless of the precise terms upon which facilities were provided
by the bank to the group.
 He asserted that he trusted the bank in that context
and enjoyed a social relationship with senior officers of the bank, with
exchanges
of hospitality by both parties.  
<P>

52   	Wright's confidence in the Wrights' enjoyment of a special
banker/customer relationship with the bank was not misplaced. 
There are
numerous records, principally in the form of credit memoranda, in evidence
which lend support to that view.  There are
two in particular at this point
that I think warrant mention.  One is the credit memorandum of Brian Thomas
Armitage (Armitage),
whose first contact with the Wrights' account was in the
role of manager in the bank's corporate sector from January 1989, at a time
when his immediate superior was Punch.  One of the rural accounts for which he
was responsible was the group account.  He prepared
a credit memorandum,
bearing date 9 September 1991, at a time shortly after Punch had ceased having
contact with the group account.
 In that credit memorandum, Armitage recorded
what he described as "Recent History of Developments".  Armitage gave evidence
of the
source of the information collected in the credit memorandum under that
heading in terms which are quoted below and which I consider
to be
significant:
<P>

"The information which I recorded under the heading `<i>Pre-1988</i>' in the
credit memorandum, reflected information which I had gleaned from the file and
from my discussions with other accounts officers
concerned with the accounts
and perhaps from the Wrights in relation to that period.  The information
recounted under the heading
`<i>1988</i>' was partly from the same source and
partly represented what I had learnt when I first became acquainted with the
accounts in early
1989 and I was furnished with the herd restructuring program
going over some four years.  The reference to that project being timed
for
completion in four years, reflects the period which was included in the herd
restructure spreadsheets which were shown to me
in early 1989.  The number of
cattle and the proposed number for production set out in this paragraph
represent the figures which
I believe were first given to me (at least
approximately) in early 1989."
<P>

53   	The record to which Armitage referred was in the following
terms:
<P>

"<u>Recent History of Developments</u> 
<P>

To appreciate the current circumstances which are having an adverse impact on
the financial position of the client it is considered
appropriate to provide a
history of our relationship and what is currently driving David Wright to
achieve his ultimate goal of PAW
being a very large fully integrated "cattle
factory" with close liaisons with major players in the beef industry worldwide.

<P>

Pre 1988
<P>

Family history is well documented at BIR previously placed on file.  During
1988 the P A Wright &amp; Sons Pty Ltd Group (PAW) was
looking at opportunities
to reduce the impact of adverse seasonal conditions and the increasing
influence that offshore markets were
expected to have on Australian beef
producers.  At that time PAW was a very well respected, highly influential and
successful farming
enterprise with operations revolving around the family
properties and the Hereford stud herd as well as the "Beefmaker" breed
developed
by PAW.
<P>

1988
<P>

Cognisant of the foregoing the total herd structure of PAW, comprising some
20,000 head, began to be altered.  This change was to
move away from being
principally a cattle fattening operation to a breeding operation capable of
producing 25,000 head pa and thus
becoming a major force in not only the beef
industry in the New England area but nationally.  The long term plan was for a
fully
integrated cattle breeding fattening and killing operation capable of
supplying a high quality product for end users in the domestic
and export
markets.  Projected timing for completion of this change in structure was four
years and PAW is nearing optimum herd numbers
at present.
<P>

The projected herd size including retention of cattle fattening capacity to
provide cash flow for operations, necessitated the acquisition
of not only
additional cattle, but substantial landholdings.
<P>

1989
<P>

To ensure that PAW had future access to a stable market for its end product,
and to ensure that the significant capital expenditure
required could be
supported by a substantial corporate entity, David Wright Snr entered into
discussions with Cargill Corporation
of the USA on a "concept basis" and
received a favourable response.
<P>

During this year a substantial cattle enterprise in Australia known as "King
Ranch" came onto the market and David Wright endeavoured
to obtain the support
of Cargill to enable a tender to be submitted.  The ANZ was involved in the
intended acquisition and submitted
a proposal for internal approval for the $97
million acquisition costs.  Unfortunately the tender was unsuccessful however
the exercise
formed closer ties between PAW &amp; Cargill.  The latter moved
too slowly in the transaction thereby failing to ensure that the
proposal would
have the best chance of succeeding.
<P>

1990
<P>

From what was recognised as a very lowly geared base, PAW entered an
expansionary phase in an endeavour to fulfil the projections
set down in 1988.
Herd numbers increased from 22,000 head to 26,000 head as part of the long term
plan which included the herd restructuring.
 The substantial grazing property
known as "Boonaldoon" was purchased mid 1990 for approx $7 million.  Additional
stocking cattle
were purchased totalling 17,000 head at a cost of $7
million.
<P>

Cattle numbers had grown to 40,000 head however total funding requirements also
escalated to $27 million on the basis that debt
would reduce by $6 million from
sale of steers purchased for fattening.
<P>

During this year the meat processing activity of Melrose Meats was acquired by
PAW again being part of the long term objective of
the group.  This exercise
proved to be a drain on PAW's financial resources and the cost was estimated to
be in the vicinity of $1
million plus.  Whilst the cost factor was
acknowledged, this acquisition enabled PAW to actively market itself to Coles
meat division
as a fully integrated beef operation able to deliver a high
quality product to meet consumers demand.  Heads of agreement were reached
for
a twelve month trial period so that both Coles &amp; PAW could ascertain the
full benefits of a closer working relationship.
 The Melrose loss
aforementioned has however been countered by the subsequent success of the
Boning Room/Feedlot operation recording
a NPBT to 6/91 of $1 million (Refer DRT
report).  Note that this was for a nine month trading period.
<P>

The Coles "contract" however required an alternation to PAW's strategies and
the cattle held for fattening were retained to fulfil
the required numbers for
the supply to Coles of 500 head per week.  This led to the extension of CBAD $5
million which was due to
retire 15/11/90.
<P>

1991
<P>

An additional property known as "Thorpleigh" was acquired for $1.22 million and
this was seen as a strategic purchase as it is located
between existing
"Achill" and "Forglen" properties.  Property was funded 100% by the Bank
increasing debt to current levels.
<P>

The combined effect of the overall expansionary activity of the group together
with build up in herd numbers saw temporary funding
requirements extended into
long term debt and position was exacerbated by the doubts as to the capacity of
the group to service its
burgeoning debt.
<P>

Consequent to the foregoing DRT were engaged in an endeavour to confirm the
safety and long term viability of the total operations."
<P>

54   	I think that evidence of Armitage leaves little room for
conjecture as to the disclosure to the bank by the Wrights of the
major change
in strategy in the conduct of their operations in 1988.  To pick up Armitage's
reference to the family history being
"well documented", I think it is useful
to have recourse to a credit memorandum of 2 July 1992, noting that this was at
a time almost
twelve months after Buckley had threatened Wright with
receivership - a confrontation addressed later in these reasons.
<P>

55   	The credit memorandum of 2 July 1992 was that of Richard
Vaughan (Vaughan), a manager responsible for the day to day conduct
of the
group account at that time.  The credit memorandum is a 28 page document.  It
is quite exhaustive and, clearly, is a collection
of bank records seen to be
pertinent to the memorandum.  It recorded the following information under the
heading "<u>FAMILY HISTORY</u>", namely:
<P>

"Charlotte May Wright moved from outback Queensland to Armidale in the 1880's
with her husband, Albert, and subsequent to the purchase
of Wallamumbi in 1899
established the now famous V2V Hereford stud.  Initial stocking of the stud was
via the direct descendants
of the first Herefords imported into Australia by
the Wright family in 1827.
<P>

Following the demise of Albert, Charlotte ran the cattle property Wallamumbi
alone and subsequently purchased an adjacent property
known as Jeogla.  At the
age of fourteen their son Philip Wright (father of David and Bruce - who are
half brothers) took over the
running of the properties until control was
assumed by PDA Wright (David), the current principal of Wallamumbi and BA
(Bruce) Wright,
now principal of Jeogla, in 1958.
<P>

In an endeavour to improve the meat producing capacity of the Hereford breed
David commenced infusion of the German Simmental breed
into his Hereford herd
and the final composition of 75% Hereford 25% Simmental resulted in the
formation of the Beefmaker breed in
1973.
<P>

Up until 1978 Wallamumbi continued to be run in conjunction with Jeogla as one
family property.  At this time, which represented
some eight years after
Phillip Wright died, David and Bruce decided to split the properties and go
their separate ways.  Reasons
for the split are not advised however there is
known to exist a substantial amount of "family rivalry".
<P>

In the division, Bruce took Jeogla (which he still runs with his son R B A
Wright (Rick) and David took Wallamumbi together with
1,067.5 ha property
Woodburn which was acquired by the family in 1965, and Achill a 2,424 ha
property which borders Wallamumbi and
was purchased in 1972.
<P>

Since then David and his personal family companies have acquired the combined
properties Forglen and Conningdale totalling 2,288
ha, Glenview 513 ha (all
adjacent to Wallamumbi), Yarrowyck - 2,670 ha near Armidale, Paradise 6,098 ha
situated near Glen Innes
Boonaldoon Moree and recently Thorpleigh, adjacent to
Forglen (see later re individual details)."
<P>

56   	There follows in the memorandum an extensive description
of the rural enterprise and the entities through which it was conducted.

<P>

57   	A less attractive side of that special banker/customer
relationship may be seen in the Buckley memorandum to the senior general
manager of business banking of 16 September 1992 which was in the following
terms:
<P>

"Following submission of CM advices for PAWS on 21st July 1992 and response
received thereto of 4th September 1992, a formal letter
of extension has been
provided to above clients which encompasses the terms and conditions imposed by
the Bank.  The client has been
banking with ANZ for over 100 years however the
current requirements imposed may see the termination of our relationship.
<P>

Advices are submitted to appraise of the possibility of Mr. David Wright
contacting most senior officers of the Bank given that
Mr. Wright has the
substantial backing of, and holds a pre-eminent position in "Agri Politics" in
this country.  A copy of Mr. Wright's
CV is attached for information.
<P>

Also attached are details for connected account Jeogla Pty Ltd &amp; Associated
Accounts (Principals being Mr. David Wright's half
brother, Bruce, and his son
Richard).
<P>

Similar difficulties have been encountered with Jeogla with possible
repercussions along the same lines as PAWS.  Richard Wright
is also a very well
known "Agri Politician" and the combined parties have the capacity to severely
damage our profile in rural Australia."
<P>

58   	To the extent that Wright gave evidence to the effect that
he placed himself and the group's interests in the hands of the
bank in the
making of management decisions of any significant financial implication, that
picture would jar very uncomfortably against
the reality of a highly
experienced rural businessman prepared to exercise his own judgment in such
matters.  However, I fully accept
that he adopted the almost invariable
practice with the bank of keeping it informed and of consulting it in relation
to proposed
business decisions.  That is not to say that there were not times
when the bank may have been informed after the event.  
<P>

59   	At the same time, his prominence in the rural industry,
which I think Wright correctly believed to extend beyond Australian
shores,
gave him access to levels of commercial influence that, naturally, he was
prepared to explore.  For example, when consideration
was given by Wright to
the attractions of borrowing in foreign currency, he had the benefit of the
opinions of Hugh Morgan, a prominent
industrialist.  
<P>

60   	Bank records indicate that Wright sought to use his
personal contact with the chairman of the Primary Industry Bank of Australia
(PIBA) in relation to a proposal for PIBA finance of $1,000,000.  The diary
note of 3 February 1983 recorded a proposal by Wright
that he and the bank
manager of the group account meet with the bank's representative on the PIBA
board.  This met with a cold reception
from the bank.  
<P>

61   	The following is an extract of the diary note of Colin
Francis Joseph Priddle (Priddle), who had contact with the Wrights
from the mid
seventies as a corporate accounts manager.  In February 1983, he had become a
senior manager responsible for the conduct
of the group account.  The following
is his record of the PIBA proposal:
<P>

"David Wright and John Robertson called to discuss long term financing of
"Forglen" purchase.  Vendor finance $1.48m due for take
out 5.4.83.   Our CBA
facility for purchase $1.5m drawn to $0.8m with take out required by
31.3.83.
<P>

Earlier this week John Robertson advised me David had spoken to Walter Ives
(Chairman of PIBA) who had given him a good hearing
and that Ives was going to
speak to ANZ representative on the PIBA board.  I had been asked to arrange for
our representative to
meet with David Wright and myself to discuss proposal for
$1m PIBA finance, which I flatly refused, informing John that if I was
prepared
to put a submission to PIBA it would be handled in this office by me.
<P>

...
<P>

Should Achill and/or Woodburn have to go to AMP, I have informed David that I
will require Wallamumbi, to which he is agreeable
albeit reluctantly.  Told him
he has no choice."
<P>

62   	In keeping with the level of financial activities involved
in the Wright enterprise, Wright looked to consultancy advice outside
of
banking circles, particularly concerning the benefits of borrowing in foreign
currency.  I have in mind the engagement of consultants
by Wright in 1986.  The
consultant, John Cherry (Cherry), was also involved in advising Wright in
relation to the group's interest
in gaining an option over extensive rural
holdings held by the Angliss group in 1986.  
<P>

63   	The diary note of 24 February 1986, signed off by Priddle,
recorded the rather sophisticated level at which Wright was approaching
the
structuring of the group's rural interests:
<P>

"Further to D/N 14/1/86 John Cherry has now proposed that a round robin
borrowing arrangement be set up as follows:-
<P>

1.	A new company, David Wright (UK) Ltd, be formed and registered as a foreign
company in UK with Directors being resident in Europe.
 This will ensure that
the company does not have to pay UK tax on profits derived from activities
outside the UK.  Cherry is able
to locate suitable Directors who will act for
the shareholder(s), probably V2V Trading Pty Ltd.
<P>

2.	PAWUK borrows CHF equiv. of AUD 4.7M from ANZ Singapore with security being
a GOB from NSW CD.
<P>

3.	On the same day PAWUK converts CHF to AUD and invests on T/D with
Singapore.
<P>

4.	On same day Singapore uses the T/D as security for a AUD loan of $4.7m to P
A Wright &amp; Sons P/L who will use funds to repay
CBA "Paradise" line.
<P>

<u>Advantages</u>
<P>

PAWUK accumulates tax free income via interest rate differentials which can be
disbursed via dividend payments to V2V and absorbed
against accumulated
losses.
<P>

PAW continues to pay interest at AUD rates which is claimed against Australian
income as is the case at present.
<P>

<u>Disadvantages</u> - PAWUK have a CHF/AUD exchange risk - a significant
devaluation of the AUD could erode the benefits of the whole exercise,
particularly
in the first couple of years.
<P>

Compencey (sic) of and controls on European Directors are unknown at this
stage.
<P>

Although this proposal does not avoid Aust tax we were concerned that ANZ may
be seen to be assisting in avoidance of tax in the
UK.
<P>

Proposition has been discussed with Gary Simon of Delfin who is quite certain
the scheme is legitimate ... "
<P>

64   	It appears from an earlier diary record of discussions
with Wright, Robertson, Nicholls and Cherry, that Wright's interest
in foreign
currency transactions extended to futures or forward buying contracts in
sterling in which Wright appears to have taken
a speculative position, gaining
him a profit of several hundred thousand dollars.  
<P>

65   	Going back a little, I think Priddle's diary note of 22
June 1984 provided probably the best insight into the relationship
between the
bank and Wright and probably recorded a significant commercial background to
the events that followed and which embraced
the June 1988 meeting:
<P>

"<u>David Wright &amp; John Robertson called for general discussions involving
principally, FCL-NT borrowings</u>.
<P>

<u>The discussions emanated from a seminar</u> attended by the gentlemen at
Walcha conducted <u>by Westpac</u> on foreign currency borrowing.
<P>

SM-ICS, Rod Gallagher outlined the basic pros and cons of such borrowings and
detailed at some length the interest costs advantages
and the exposure to
exchange fluctuations.
<P>

Having digested Rod's explanations and advice, David then advised of his
serious interest in such a loan.   David has always intimated
to us in the past
that his sizeable assets $16/18m have not been utilised to best advantage in
the past and the time is at hand to
put into practice his thesis.
<P>

In particular, he is looking at 2 properties : -
<P>

1.	      Property known as "Paradise" (15095a) which he formerly part owned
before selling to Powder River Pastoral Co. Sale price
WIWO is $4.2m and
includes 2100 head cattle.  David believes the owners are keen to sell and he
proposes to offer $3.5m.
<P>

2.	Property of 2500 adjoining "Woodburn" for which he will offer $100,000.
<P>

Both properties will be used primarily to fatten cattle.  Soil contains high
levels of phosphate thus fertiliser costs will be negligible.
<P>

In addition he proposes to purchase additional store cattle for fattening on
subject properties.  Present breeding stock on Paradise
would be transferred to
other holdings.
<P>

In essence David is <u>looking to</u> $5m in FCL-NT for 5/7 years, on basis of
bullett <u>repayment</u> at end of this period, <u>from either resale</u> of
the Paradise property, which he says <u>based on land appreciation</u> in the
New England area over the past 20 years <u>will double</u> in value within that
period <u>or from refinance and/or cattle sales</u>.
<P>

Rod indicated to David that he could expect CHF to cost in the order of 6% or
slightly more all up and rely on savings in interest
plus the capital gain to
offset any exchange rate fluctuation which may go against him.
<P>

Rod recommended that borrowings be on a 180 day rollover basis rather than a
fixed interest term of say 5 years as this may not
be to his benefit if early
repayment is required.  <u>Clawback agreement was explained and was not well
received as Westpac do not seek clawback during currency of their lending</u>.
We indicated we are not inflexible but we wish to be in a position to control
any adverse situation which may arise.
<P>

It was pointed out in respect to Westpac (we hold copy of seminar documentation
etc) that they are more conservative on the security
side and would insist on
security ratios being maintained in the event of exchange rate going against
the customer.
<P>

We have informed David that if the Bank is to favourably receive a formal
application, he will have to accept our requirement for
a loan/security rate of
65/70% which could well involve him in having to recharge his homestead
property, Wallamumbi.  Naturally
he is loathe to have to do so and has
requested revaluation of our securities together with those held by AMP over
which 2nd charges
can be taken, namely Forglen, Conningdale, Achill loch Abba.
Other stations to be valued include Wallamumbi, Woodburn, Yarrowyck
and the
properties being considered for purchase.
<P>

AMP loan funds are $1.75m.
<P>

John Robertson is to prepare cashflow forecasts for year 1/7/84 to 30/6/85 and
forward asap.
<P>

Preliminary budget for Paradise property indicates interest cost can be
serviced from income of that property alone.
<P>

<u>Action by MCAS</u>
<P>

1.	Obtain revaluations/new valuations of all properties.
<P>

2.	Obtain consent from AMP to second charges."
<P>

(emphasis added.) 
<P>

66   	In my view, that state of affairs reflected considerable
independence of thought, as one might expect, in Wright's commercial
decisions
and in his dealings with the bank.  It was at this time that Wright had
discussions with Hugh Morgan concerning borrowing
in foreign currency.  Wright
lost no time in advancing the matters under discussion in June as is recorded
in the diary note signed
off by Priddle of 28 September 1984 recording annual
review discussions with Wright and Robertson.  It noted that contracts had been
exchanged for the purchase of Paradise on a `walk in, walk out' basis for
$3,700,000 and that a $5,000,000 foreign currency loan
would be utilised for
the completion of that purchase.  The diary note also recorded an interest of
Wright in another property called
Tobermore.  The diary note recorded the
following after a review of the security position of the Wright facilities,
namely:
<P>

"David is aware that we wish to see a period of consolidation following this
latest acquisition which he acknowledges."
<P>

67   	I have no doubt that, in practical terms, the relationship
between the bank and Wright was such that the principal facilities
provided
were on a revolving basis.  That was doubtless, in part, due to the highly
respected position of the Wrights, the substantial
security cover for
borrowings and the practical certainty of the Wrights' continued long term
involvement in pastoral activities,
particularly in the New England and south
west Queensland districts. 
<P>

68   	The possibility of the bank calling up its facilities, I
think, would be quite unrealistic.  It would simply mean the group
taking its
account and its extensive assets elsewhere, to be welcomed with open arms.
<P>

69   	The independence of Wright in relation to the taking of
business decisions, which is completely unsurprising, is reflected
in the diary
note, signed off by Priddle, of 7 November 1984:
<P>

"John Robertson rang to advise that David Wright now wants to purchase a 1000
acre property adjoining "Achill" for $270,000.  Terms
are vendor finance of
$200,000 for 12 months.  Requests our assistance to finance balance and takeout
vendor finance when due.  <u>Our view which was made clear to David during
recent A/R discussions and which still stands is that he should refrain from
further
borrowings and enter into a period of consolidation</u>.  John agrees
but feels that Davids argument will be that we had originally agreed to FCL $5m
which was reduced to $4.7m only because
he was not successful at auction for
the "Tobermorey" property.  John will suggest that David contact us direct if
he wishes to pursue
the matter.
<P>

<u>CASH FLOW 19/9/84 - 30/6/85</u>
<P>

John pointed out that there has been a misunderstanding with the budget as
cattle purchases for Nov. do not represent "Paradise"
purchases which have been
deferred to 4/85.  The amount of $1.05m represents normal purchases, most of
which are as follows:
<P>

1.	15,000 sheep @ $24 ph = $360,000 (payment has however, been deferred until
7/85)
<P>

2.	About 1,500 cattle worth .5m from Jeogla next week.
<P>

Our understanding at A/R was that no large purchases were planned as prices
were too high; <u>David has changed course again!</u>. 
<P>

Draw down of FCL later this month should provide sufficient funds to cover
cattle purchases, however, John will prepare fresh cash
flow to confirm."
<P>

(Emphasis added.)
<P>

70   	There were a number of commercial steps taken by Wright in
the lead up to the June meeting that I think have some bearing
on the approach
one should adopt to the significance of steps taken by Wright following the
June meeting and, in particular, steps
which I think show Wright in a decisive,
largely independent and acquisitive role.  In mid 1985, Wright was exploring
the acquisition
for several million dollars of a 12,000 acre property called
Goonoo Goonoo.  It was situated in the north west slopes country south
of the
New England district where the majority of the group's holdings were situated.

<P>

71   	It is interesting, I think, to note that Wright
contemplated repayment of further borrowings to acquire Goonoo Goonoo by
subdivision
and sale of that property into 2,000 acre blocks.  The diary note
of 22 May 1985, signed off by Priddle, recorded these matters and
the interest
of Wright in a syndicate considering the purchase of a cattle property and meat
works in Vanuatu.  The Goonoo Goonoo
proposal did not meet with Priddle's
enthusiastic support as conveyed to the Wrights by him.  
<P>

72   	The diary notes of Priddle of that period, I think, are
instructive.  It is clear he did not see the Goonoo Goonoo purchase
as "a
viable proposition unless purchased for a `song'" and that this was conveyed to
Wright.  It is also clear that Wright was not
dissuaded from pursuing the
purchase of Goonoo Goonoo and indeed sought, and obtained, the bank's approval
to increase borrowings
by $6,200,000 to enable him to bid for Goonoo Goonoo at
auction.  I note that the repayment terms proposed were as follows:  within
one
year, repayment of $2,000,000 "from outside finance, e.g. AMP"; $1,000,000 from
cashflow within 12 months and $3,200,000 by October
1988 from subdivision sales
or cashflow.  As it happened, the property was purchased by another.
Undeterred by that unsuccessful
exercise, it appears that Robertson informed
the bank shortly after that Wright was looking at a 60,000 acre property, known
as Meeleebee,
situated north of Roma in Queensland.
<P>

73   	The bank memorandum of Priddle recommending the increase
in facilities of $6,200,000, which went to senior management and
bears their
note of support, described the "<u>Background</u>" to the application in the
following terms:
<P>

"The Wright connection dates back to 1880 and forms a significant part of our
Armidale Branch business.  David Wright interests
own 7 prime properties in the
New England area worth $14.3m on our land values.  Existing stock of 18000
cattle and 39000 sheep are
worth $7.1m.  In addition David shares 2 properties
in Queensland with a brother and it is estimated that his half share is worth
$3/4m.
<P>

The <u>net</u> worth of David would be in the vicinity of $16/18m.  <u>David
was concerned that he has not been utilising his sizeable assets to his best
advantage and accordingly purchased the "Paradise"
property in 10/84 for a
total outlay of $3.7m which we financed on a 5 year interest only FCL-NT/CBA
facility</u>.  Acting on the advice of S.M.I.C.S. this loan has remained on
shore to date.
<P>

David is a well known identity in NSW being on the committee of AMLC and an
executive of CSIRO.  In addition he is Chairman of Australian
Meat Research
Council and President of the Hereford Society."
<P>

(emphasis added)
<P>

74   	Among the matters noted on this recommendation was the
following:
<P>

"<u>Mr Wright is following a pattern of building up land holdings and stock
values while maintaining profitability at low levels for taxation
purposes.
Projected surplus cash flow after allowing effective capitalisation of interest
to 30/6/86 gives support to servicing of
debt overall</u>.
<P>

Proposed reduction in debt is supported but is dependant on Wright actually
proceeding should he be successful with purchase.  While
this is open ended
stock held provides ability to substantially reduce debt at any time should
adverse conditions arise.
<P>

Submission is considered safe and our support as detailed for Mr Wright will
further enhance our dealings in the New England area
even if anticipated price
at auction goes beyond Mr Wright's $350pa."
<P>

(Emphasis added)
<P>

75   	The only discordant note of senior management was the
observation that the Wrights were "constant hard core borrowers'.  There
was a
comparatively minor further acquisition of property by Wright in September 1985
with the purchase of Greenhills, a 1,500 acre
property which adjoined
Wallamumbi.
<P>

76   	The diary note of 27 September 1985, signed off by
Priddle, recorded Wrights' interest in Meeleebee at a level of $6,500,000.
 The
same record noted that Wright was also considering an offer of $1,100,000 for
another grazing property known as Glanmire:  this,
I might note, at a time when
interest rates were in the order of 20% per annum.  It was shortly after this
that Cherry appeared on
the scene.  It appears from bank records in the second
half of 1985 into February 1986 that there were fairly extensive discussions
involving Wright, Robertson, Nicholls and Cherry over the prudence of engaging
in borrowings in foreign currency.  I suspect that
those discussions were
fuelled partly by the fact that a forward buying contract for sterling
equivalent of $4,700,000 in November
1985 had resulted in a windfall profit of
$324,000 to the group.  That favourable trading result was not reflected in
1986 when significant
losses were incurred through speculative currency
trading.
<P>

77   	In February 1986, Priddle received a confidential
communication from Wright reflecting the latter's interest in the rural
properties of Queensland Stations Limited, referred to earlier in these reasons
as the Angliss group.  
<P>

78   	The nature of the transaction is worth noting as I think
it reflected the business activities of a pastoralist at a comparatively
elevated commercial level.  The diary note of Priddle recorded the
following:
<P>

"David Wright advises confidentially that Queensland Stations Ltd (Anglis
Group) is disposing of 7/8 breeding properties carrying
about 140,000 head of
cattle.  Because of the tax value of livestock, tax impost on profit of their
sale would be prohibitive.  Hence
the only way they can be disposed is by sale
of the owning company shares.
<P>

David is not looking to take a personal equity but rather as agent in the sale
but that he will need to take an option to purchase.
 The option would contain
a clause that the option holder (P A Wright &amp; Sons Pty Ltd) can
pass/transfer its option in the event
PAW did not proceed.
<P>

He has located a rural company with tax losses of $35m whose principals are
keen to examine the Anglis properties and supposedly
have the wherewithall
(sic) to handle an acquisition of this size; said to be in the region of
$25/30m.
<P>

David will take an option but it will be only activated on if he can organise
an unconditional back to back deal with the tax loss
company and its
principals.
<P>

The reason he is informing me of the above is in case I am contacted for
opinion on worth of P A Wright &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and its
capacity to handle an
acquisition of $25/30m should he seek to execute such an option.  Indicated
that if I am approached it will
be from either Len Heineman of Dalgety Real
Estate or Adrian Gibson, Ch. of Q'ld Stations.
<P>

Told David that the gentlemen should be informed to seek bankers opinion
through normal channels.  If they do come direct I would
require his written
authority to discuss.  Agreed."
<P>

79   	Wright's business activities in 1986 included dealing in
steer futures which I assume were hedge transactions to support the
physical
livestock sales by PAWS.
<P>

80   	Punch's remarks in the diary note of 31 October 1986,
signed off by Meers as recording the outcome of discussions at the annual
review of the group account with Wright, reflected a commercial relationship
which formed a setting to the June meeting.  It was
in the following terms:
<P>

"<u>General</u> 
<P>

Mr Wright is acutely aware of his current exposure and the crippling effect the
interest bill is having on his overall operation.
 He has identified 5 methods
whereby some relief could be forthcoming:-
<P>

1.	<u>Off-Shore Borrowing</u>
<P>

Professionally managed to incorporate the $5M FCL-NT/CBA exposure relating to
CBA-Special Line.  We have however indicated our objection
to such a proposal
in view of the strong possibility of incurring further losses with no
underlying trade transactions evident to
act as a natural hedge.
<P>

We would ask Mr. Wright to refinance elsewhere in the event he insisted on
exercising FCL-NT option which was previously accorded
at original approval of
CBA-Special Line.  This option is to be withdrawn as stated in our annual
review letter - see later.
<P>

2.	<u>Sale of Assets</u>
<P>

Must be considered as a strong possibility although in the current economic
climate it is argued as to the return that would be
achieved.
<P>

3.	<u>Fixed/Floating Borrowing</u>
<P>

An option we are watching closely with a view to locking in a portion of the
$5M facility.  This would at least have the effect
of providing an accurate
measure of interest rates for the fixed component.
<P>

4.	<u>Export Market</u>
<P>

Through a venture currently in train where Mr. Wright is looking to
shareholding in Melrose Meats Pty. Ltd. (Qld).  This incorporates
meat
processing/exporting and would provide returns in USD against what would be USD
borrowing.  The proposal is currently before
Qld. Corporate although
establishment of overseas markets as far as Mr. Wright is concerned could take
some time.
<P>

This is a long term project and in our view will provide no relief to our
customers interest overheads in the short term.
<P>

5.	<u>Overseas Investment in Australia</u>
<P>

Mr. Wright has commissioned several contacts in various parts of the world in
an endeavour to attract overseas investors into Australia
(mainly in the rural
environment)  He would act as the "spotter" and ultimate manager of any
investments.  Returns would go towards
reduction of core borrowing although
again this seems some time off if indeed it were to succeed.
<P>

Each proposal has its merits (with the exception of unhedged off-shore
borrowing) however even allowing for the present position
we remain adequately
secured and satisfied as to Mr. Wright's ability in the rural scene.  His net
worth would be in the vicinity
of $10M and there is no chance of him walking
away from his responsibilities.  Exposure is therefore considered quite safe
with further
margin in security expected following revaluation of properties.
(It should also be noted that the prime Wallamumbi family property
remains
unencumbered.  (total worth $4,120,000 - 1984)."
<P>

81   	In my view, the year 1987 did not reflect any lessening of
Wright's interest in further property acquisitions.  In that year,
funds were
expended in the acquisition of shares in Melrose and in mid year he expressed
interest in the purchase of a property known
as Milo Station, albeit for
onsale, or as the subject of a joint venture with an overseas investor.  
<P>

82   	The credit memorandum of Meers of 4 December 1987
following the annual review in November, I think, provided the immediate
setting for the June meeting as far as it recorded discussions with Wright, the
bank's attitude to the safety of the security provided
by the Wrights and the
high regard in which Wright was held by the bank:  matters which I think were
conveyed to Wright.  It contained
the following comment on the group's
management, namely:
<P>

"Third generation farmers who are well experienced in the industry and of
undoubted integrity."
<P>

83   	Meers noted in his diary note, under the section
"<u>Strategy/Future Action</u>", the following, which I think lends
considerable weight to the Wrights' version of the discussion at the June
meeting with Punch:
<P>

"The company's cash flow forecast reflect Mr. Wright's strategy/belief that the
rural industry is about to enter a return to economic
prosperity, with
commodity prices (particularly beef and wool) to continue to improve.
<P>

Mr. Wright's outlook it also supported by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics
through a report compiled as at September 1987 -
Refer attached Addendum Marked
`A'.
<P>

Mr. Wright's strategy involves the continued build up of livestock on the
Group's properties and increase productivity in order
to meet the proposed
increased demand for Australian beef and wool which should return the Group to
a profitable base.  All the Group's
land holdings are well maintained and the
infrastructure is geared to support his strategy.
<P>

In outlining his strategy, Mr. Wright has also acknowledged the unknown effect
that the recent share market crash may have on worldwide
commodity prices.
However, despite this he believes only selected commodity prices would be
effected with good beef and wool prices
to continue due to:
<P>

*	         A shortage of beef in North America.
<P>

*	The continued demand for Australian wool in Russia and China, which should
not be effected (sic) by the Western world's share
crash. 
<P>

<u>Despite Mr. Wright's bullish outlook, he also remains cautious</u> of the
world economic situation and its effects that could compound the problems his
own operations are currently experiencing. 
Accordingly, <u>he has outlined the
following courses of future action to be taken if a downturn in livestock and
wool prices were to occur and the
group net worth was to deteriorate</u>.  Mr.
Wright believes he has the following saleable assets within the group to
achieve such an objective:
<P>

(i)	<u>Sell off a large number of his livestock</u> holdings to reduce the
current debt position.  This would also mean that no additional livestock
purchases provided in Group's cashflow
will proceed.
<P>

We estimate that a sell off of approximately half of the group's livestock
would result in a reduction of company's debt to say
$4m.
<P>

(ii)	<u>Introduce equity capital</u> into group farm operation via Mr. Wright's
connections through AUSTIM.  All group properties were purchased before capital
gains
tax was introduced and Mr. Wright would not wish to see a complete sell
off of any of these properties.
<P>

At our annual review discussion we questioned whether sheding (sic) of
stock/land should not occur now, notwithstanding, the encouraging
commentary on
world beef and wool commodities.
<P>

<u>Mr. Wright was advised that his present strategy was susceptible as it
required maintenance of a high level of stock to service interest
and operating
costs.  On the current basis of operation there is no room for principal
repayments</u>.
<P>

<u>It is apparent that his operations are exposed to adverse climatic
conditions and volatility in market prices particularly for beef.
 The
operations are also exposed to interest rate changes but to a lesser extent as
we have encouraged Mr. Wright to utilise fixed
rate commercial bills</u>.
<P>

<u>Accordingly, we have informed Mr. Wright that we are not prepared to support
his requirement for additional facilities in 1988 for
stock purchases.  Mr.
Wright has asked us to review this decision in early 1988 in light of market
trends in commodity prices and
the general economic outlook</u>."
<P>

(Emphasis added.)
<P>

84   	In summarising the position, Meers recorded the following,
which again I think has particular significance in relation to
the June
meeting:
<P>

"Mr. Wright is one of Australia's most experienced cattlemen.  Management of
his operations are supported by the services of a rural
consultant and
experienced farm managers.  Mr. Wright has two sons engaged in his
operations.
<P>

Based on existing security position including Mr. Wright's guarantee, we feel
that our position is safe.
<P>

However, in sight of a difficult year ahead, particularly in major beef markets
- Australia and USA, we consider his strategy is
susceptible to adverse changes
in climate and market prices.  <u>We have requested a rethink in his
strategy</u> to reduce borrowings through reduction in stock numbers now (in
sight of favourable market prices) or realisation of farm properties/joining
with equity partners.
<P>

Mr. Wright has been advised that the Bank will not support the additional stock
purchases in 1988 and will assist with short term/liquidating
requirements
pending our next interim review.
<P>

<u>In view of the customers planned approach and our alternate view we
have</u>:
<P>

-	<u>requested that monthly results (income/expenditure) be provided to enable
us to assess actual to budgetted (sic) positions</u>.
<P>

-	         <u>established an interim review by 30.4.88 to review his
strategy</u>."
<P>

(Emphasis added)
<P>

85   	I think it is clear from those records that, by June of
1988, Wright had embarked upon a course of property expansion aimed
at
utilising the Wrights' very substantial asset backing with the conviction that,
notwithstanding very high interest rates, borrowings
would be justified through
capital gain.  Further, that his extensive knowledge of the domestic and
international cattle market satisfied
him that a strategy of herd build-up was
justified on the basis of a return to attractive commodity prices underpinned
by shortages,
in particular, in beef markets.  
<P>

86   	Notwithstanding the group's proposal that a review by 30
April 1988 should be undertaken to reconsider the group's strategy,
no such
review appears to have occurred prior to the June meeting and the suggested
"rethink" of a strategy involving a herd build-up
does not fit comfortably
beside the strategy which, on the Wrights' evidence, they unfolded to the bank
in the June meeting for the
first time.  I would have expected the Wrights'
account of the June meeting to have included a reference to the bank's
unfavourable
response to a similar proposal by the Wrights at the end of 1987.
I think those considerations reinforce the approach I have adopted
to the
Wrights' evidence of conversations; concentrating on the substance and not the
detail.
<P>

87   	There is an extraordinary paucity of bank records relating
to the group account in the first half of 1988.  The records concerning
the
Queensland account of Melrose noted the movement of the Wrights into a 51%
holding.  There is a diary note of Meers of 10 February
1988 which noted
Wright's interest in acquiring a commercial property in Pyrmont, Sydney.  A
diary note of Meers of 16 February 1988
recorded some concern with the Wrights'
overdraft position which, it was said, was conveyed to Nicholls and in which
the bank sought
information of the Wrights' "ongoing strategy concerning the
sale of ... cattle stock in order to reduce the debt burden ...".  A
letter
from Nicholls to the bank of 26 February 1988 envisaged preparation and supply
to the bank of a two year forecast, but that
does not appear to have
eventuated.  Other than that, there is the letter, earlier referred to in these
reasons, from Nicholls to
Punch of 27 June 1988, forwarding financials and
stock figures to the bank in anticipation of the June meeting.  
<P>

88   	It is almost impossible to accept that there were no
communications diarised by the bank in that six month period other than
those
to which I have referred - leaving aside the Melrose account.  Yet, so far as I
am aware, the only records in evidence are
those to which I have referred.
Still, I have no reason to think, nor do I, that any records have been
suppressed.  
<P>

89   	There is some artificiality in analysing in detail the
evidence of Wright and of David Wright in relation to the June meeting
as
contrasted with the evidence of Punch on that subject which was unaided by any
record.  Punch's memory of the occasion, by his
own admission, is poor.  His
position is that there was no ten year plan presented to him at that meeting
involving a build-up of
breeding herd from 8,000 to 20,000.  I would put that
down to poor memory as distinct from a convenient one.  I am quite satisfied
that such a proposal was put in front of him.  
<P>

90   	Wright has given two versions of the discussion that took
place at the June 1988 meeting.  The first, an affidavit sworn 19
November 1996
(the Wright affidavit), filed and served pursuant to directions of the court of
28 October and 15 November 1996, which
required the group to file their defence
and cross-claim together with affidavits of facts and circumstances on which
they relied.
 The second statement was that of 2 March 1998 (Wright's first
statement).  Wright's first statement gives a more detailed description
of the
June 1988 meeting than is found in the Wright affidavit.  I accept his
explanation for this, in that the Wright affidavit
was prepared in
circumstances of urgency.  
<P>

91   	The statement of David Wright of 2 March 1988, devoted ten
pages of detailed conversation which, to his recollection, occurred
at the June
meeting.  Wright's first statement devoted twelve pages of detailed
conversation which he recalled having taken place
at this meeting.  Given my
acceptance of the truthfulness of the Wrights, the detailed nature of their
recollections of the content
of this discussion presents something of a
challenge in the absence of any contemporaneous record in the form of minutes
that may
have assisted the exercise.  In one sense the task is made a little
easier by the evidence of Wright in cross-examination that the
only commitment
made by the bank on this occasion was "to agree to capitalise interest or to
allow (the group) to pay interest out
of working capital from time to time (and
that ) additional capital requirements for acquisitions of any further
expansion (would)
be subject to close analysis and would stand on their own
merits" (T48).  
<P>

92   	The evidence of Wright and David Wright was that Wright
began the discussion with a description of the mixed grazing operation
conducted by the Wrights, with emphasis upon the cattle grazing enterprise
which included some 8,000 breeding cows in a commercial
herd, in addition to a
stud herd.  He described the manner in which the steer offspring were fattened
to be sold as bullocks at two
to three years of age, while heifers were sold as
weaners where not required as replacement heifers, or retained to be sold as
joined
and tested in calf breeders.  Wright expressed confidence in the future
of the beef industry, principally on the basis of declining
national herd
numbers and favourable overseas factors.  
<P>

93   	He described options open to PAWS, included amongst which
was a ten year plan aimed at controlling the production line of
beef through to
the retailer.  Involved in that was a change in management principles by which
the breeding herd was to be built
up to 20,000 cows with the progeny sold off
as calves.  The build-up was to be achieved through the retention of suitable
heifers
rather than by purchase.  It was thought the build-up could be achieved
over a five year period subject to adverse market or seasonal
conditions which
might extend the program another two years or so.  
<P>

94   	Wright envisaged the acquisition of the outstanding
interest in Kindon and possibly the purchase of other properties suitable
for
backgrounding cattle in preparation for fattening for sale.  He also
contemplated further involvement in the meat processing
side of the industry to
gain the benefit of profits available down the beef production chain.  Melrose
was seen to play a possible
part in the activity.
<P>

95   	Wright thought that once the operation grew to the desired
size, that would open the opportunity for supply contracts to outlets
such as
the major supermarkets.  
<P>

96   	So, in summary, there were four aspects to the plan:  one,
the increase in the breeding herd, through retention of heifers
with the
consequent changes in marketing strategy; two, involvement in the meat
processing activity in the marketing of beef; three,
acquisition of further
properties, including Kindon, to fatten and background offspring; and, four,
obtaining long term supply contracts
with major retail outlets.  
<P>

97   	In support of this ten year plan, David Wright, at the
invitation of Wright, tabled a computer printout entitled "<b>Herd structure
gross margin analysis - target 20,000 breeders</b>".  Without decrying the
amount of work that may have gone into the production of this schedule, it is
fair to describe it as a basic
analysis.  It identified parameters such as
joining rates, retention percentages, culling rates and the like.  It
identified the
number of cows at the commencement of the ten year period which
was consistent with the description of 8,000 breeders and the composition
of
the herd at the end of ten years which was consistent with the build-up of the
breeders to 20,000.  It provided a schedule of
marketing numbers and values
over that period.  In broad terms it was consistent with a sell off of steers
in the first year and
the downturn in income in the early years as a result of
the retention of the heifers, as described by Wright.  
<P>

98   	It did not deal with costs.  During cross-examination of
the Wrights it was explained that computer limitations was the reason
for the
omission of costs projections.  Gross income projections did not take into
account the disposal of sheep or of the stud herd
or of any discrete steer
trading activity.
<P>

99   	The evidence of David Wright is that he described the
analysis to Punch.  However, if it is reasonable to describe the analysis
as a
basic one, David Wright's description of it was simplistic.  He drew attention
to the particular projected gross income projections
for each of the ten years
which he said reflected the retention of heifers and the sell off of steers and
he explained that the model
assumed that offspring would be sold off in mid
winter in relation to spring weaners and in late summer, early autumn in the
case
of autumn weaners.  There was no attempt to analyse expenses.  It was
assumed that they would "essentially remain the same".  According
to David
Wright, his father sounded a note of caution in relation to the possible effect
of adverse seasonal conditions on the plan's
timing and emphasised the need for
additional funding for "the acquisition of backgrounding and feedlot
operations, which hopefully
would be at Kindon", and further "funding and
working capital to expand ... meat processing interests and to develop market
outlets".
 Wright also emphasised the problems that a reduced cashflow could
create, particularly if there was a drought and then stated:
<P>

"It would be very important if we were to embark on this strategy that we can
rely on the support of the bank to cover working capital
requirements and
interest throughout the 10 year period until we are in a position to make
capital repayments.  If the Bank was not
prepared to agree to this we would not
embark on it."  
<P>

100   	As David Wright recalled, the response of Punch was in
the following terms:
<P>

"The Bank regards your family as an extremely important customer.  Your profile
in the industry has significant benefits for the
Bank as your family's Bankers.
It is pleasing to see that you have analysed your options in this way.  The 10
Year plan makes a lot
of sense and has been very well thought through.  Whilst
there will be cash flow constraints until the benefits flow after 1993 I
understand that this will be dependent upon the season.  I understand the
assumptions and agree with the change in strategy and we
won't require debt
reduction until you have surplus cashflow during the 10 year period.  It is a
long term program which requires
our support which we are happy to provide.  If
drought occurs, or in the event of market vagaries, then we will address those
as
they arise.  However, you can take it that we will cover your working
capital requirements to cover interest and overheads as we
have in the past for
the duration of the 10 year plan.  We look forward to the steer sale.  Keep us
posted in the meantime."
<P>

101   	To the recollection of David Wright, the only other
matter discussed was the possible acquisition of the outstanding interest
in
Kindon and that objective, he said, was also supported by Punch.  Although
expressed in more detail, I think Wright's first statement
is much along the
same lines as that evidenced by David Wright with perhaps more emphasis on the
possible involvement of joint venturers
and the extent of the integration of
activities along the beef supply line.  He attributed to Punch the following
response:
<P>

"The concept that you have talked about today is very exciting and it is one
that the Bank fully endorses.  I acknowledge that you
have an amount of debt
outstanding.  The Bank's attitude to its relationship with your family is that
you are a valued and preferred
client of high standing and the Bank is anxious
to assist you to achieve your growth objectives.  I can clearly see that your
enterprise
growth will be a phased process.  However, the principle supporting
our relationship is that the Bank is very comfortable in advancing
you loan
funds providing your asset growth continues in the future to maintain adequate
relativity with your borrowings thus providing
the Bank with adequate security
as it has to date.
<P>

As you are aware, the Bank is not uncomfortable with the level of debt that you
have.  We regard your family as leaders in the cattle
industry.  We want to
support the family in the growth of its enterprise as this will be beneficial
to both parties."
<P>

102   	Having read the internal memorandum of the bank in the
year prior to the June meeting, it is difficult to reconcile that
material with
the last statement attributed to Punch.  After the herd analysis schedule had
been explained by David Wright, according
to Wright's recollection, the
response of Punch was in the following terms:
<P>

"It is a well-conceived programme supported by logic and fact.  There is no
doubt that it is a good idea to make this change in
your production strategy
for the longer term.  The Bank will support you in this programme and provide
ongoing working capital, as
it relates to any shortfall in cashflow.  I agree
that you should proceed."
<P>

103   	The evidence of Wright was that he then told Punch that
the Wrights would "definitely need the Bank's support" and that they
could not
"embark on this program unless (they had) the unqualified support of the
Bank".
<P>

104   	The final statement of support was attributed to Punch in
the following terms:
<P>

"Yes we will support it.  I understand what the basis for the strategy is, and
the benefits from it.  We recognise there will naturally
be cashflow restraints
during the period of herd growth, but the benefits will flow, as you have
shown, some time after 1993.  The
initial reduction in income is justified
given the substantially increased income generated during the last half of the
programme
by which time the asset volume of the larger breeding herd will also
have substantially increased."
<P>

105   	According to Wright, he stressed with Punch the necessity
of having the bank's support for this change in business strategy
and informed
Punch that if the bank did not regard it as a "prudent and logical strategy
then (they) would not proceed along these
lines".  He said he emphasised this
by saying:
<P>

"We need to be sure that you understand every aspect of the strategy so that
hopefully it can receive the unqualified support of
the Bank.  Unless we can
avoid paying principal and interest other than from cashflow we are not
interested in pursuing the strategy."
<P>

106   	In his evidence Punch did not attempt to give his
recollection of the detail of the discussion, as a result, principally,
of his
faulty recollection of the content of that discussion.  He was clear that he
gave no assurances of bank support of endorsement
for a ten year plan.  Indeed,
he was clear that no such plan was put to him, although he agreed that a
printout was presented by
David Wright which "contained a large number of
figures organised into columns and rows" which was simply described as a
computer
printout "modelling possible future strategies for cattle retention
and backgrounding on the properties".  
<P>

107   	According to Punch, the thrust of the discussion was not
in terms of discussing a plan of the Wrights:  it was more of a
case of looking
at "options for the future".  With some justification, he pointed to the
improbability of him giving the undertakings
attributed to him on the strength
of a schedule as simplistic as the herd structure analysis produced by David
Wright.  Punch denied
his attention was drawn to any impact on cashflow of any
retention of heifer offspring implicit in the herd analysis shown to him.
 He
also emphasised the fact that the absence of bank records of the meeting was
significant for an account that was classified as
"C" grade.  Such a grading
imposed on him particular requirements to report to head office in Melbourne on
any significant developments
with the account.  
<P>

108   	He outlined his practice in a situation as presented by
the Wrights in their evidence of the June 1988 meeting as follows:
<P>

"55.	Having regard to my practices, and the procedures of the Bank then in
place, I am satisfied that had a presentation of the
type and with the content
alleged by Mr Wright Senior and Mr Wright Junior been made to me, then a
detailed diary note would have
been prepared.  Moreover, a fundamental change
in the business of a customer to whom the Bank had loans then outstanding of
more
than $10.5 million, incorporating features of the kind referred to in the
preceding paragraph of this statement, with the resulting
commitment and
support which would have been required of and from the Bank, would have lead me
to initiate an immediate review of
the Bank's existing lending to the Wrights
and the plan as it was presented.  To conduct that review I would have required
and sought
from the Wrights copies of their most recent management accounts and
cash flows, copies of the material said to have been presented
at the meeting
on 30 June 1988 and a written statement of the plan.  This information would
then have been analysed by me and my
assistant, and a formal submission
prepared to Mr Roger Fenton, State Manager Corporate Banking, if it was deemed
appropriate to
proceed.  The submission would have contained my recommendation
to either support or reject the plan and a statement of  the conditions
that
should apply if the Bank's support was to be forthcoming.  Once the Bank's
response had been obtained then it would have been
recorded in a diary note and
communicated to the Wrights by letter from me to them.  This entire process
would have taken some weeks
to complete.  None of the steps I have just
described took place in connection with any plan of the type alleged to have
been presented
to me at the meeting on 30 June 1988, after either that meeting
of any later meeting I had with the Wrights."
<P>

109   	I have no doubt that the Wrights had formulated in their
own minds a strategy aimed at a substantial build-up of the breeding
herd along
the lines set out in the herd analysis of David Wright.  I am also satisfied
that, in brief outline, that strategy was
explained to Punch, much along the
lines evidenced by David Wright.  I am also prepared to accept that Wright
sought the bank's support
for this program in the sense that the bank
understood the plan which the Wrights were contemplating.  In that context, I
accept
that he referred to the possibility that unseasonal conditions and other
trading vicissitudes could require temporary financial assistance
from the
bank.  I am also prepared to accept that Wright informed Punch that PAWS would
not follow this course without bank approval.
 
<P>

110   	I have no difficulty in accepting that Punch reassured
the Wrights of continued bank support and that he gave some expression
to the
respect that the bank had for the position of the Wrights as longstanding,
prominent customers of the bank.  
<P>

111   	I also accept that Punch included in that line of support
the possibility of financing further acquisitions by the Wrights,
whether it
was stated expressly or was implicit in the discussion.  I am also satisfied
that the occasional need to supplement cashflow
with working capital to meet
other commitments was contemplated as falling within the sort of financial
support that the Wrights
may have needed from time to time.  
<P>

112   	It does not follow that I accept that the Wrights would
not have pursued the build-up of the breeding herd in the absence
of approval
from the bank.  I am satisfied that Wright was convinced that the prospects of
the cattle industry were bright and that
PAWS, with the substantial holdings
under its control, was in a unique position to take advantage of that
situation, in particular,
through the build-up of the female herd.  While
accepting the value that Wright placed upon his family's longstanding
relationship
with the bank, I have no doubt that, albeit reluctantly, he would
have moved elsewhere for banking services had he seen the attitude
of the bank
as thwarting this business strategy. 
<P>

113   	While I accept the importance that Wright placed upon the
approval of Punch for the general direction in which PAWS was heading,
I do not
accept that PAWS embarked upon a business course which it would not have
pursued in the absence of that approval.  The June
meeting, in my view, was an
example of Wright keeping the bank informed of significant management decisions
affecting PAWS.  I am
also satisfied that Wright regarded the bank's approval
in principle as important as committing the bank to some level of support
for
the group's strategy.  I am equally satisfied that a withholding of support by
the bank would have seen the group account go
elsewhere.
<P>

114   	The four phase aspect of the ten year plan is difficult
to identify in the activities of Wright in the immediately following
years.
The herd build-up, as proposed, was by natural increase from progeny of the
existing herd on existing properties.  The concepts
of a major supply contract
and the acquisition of backgrounding properties, I would have thought, were
phases that, in the ordinary
course, would have occurred after a period of
substantial build-up of the breeding herd in the manner contemplated.  
<P>

115   	For reasons that follow, the subsequent activities of
Wright cannot be reasonably equated with the ten year plan as outlined
at the
June meeting.  It is possible to recognise elements in those activities which
were conceptually similar to the subject of
discussions at the November 1987
annual review and at the June meeting.  However, I think it is quite
unrealistic to translate any
of the assurances gained from Punch at the June
1988 meeting as a commitment of the bank upon which the group relied in its
major
expansion, particularly in 1990.  
<P>

116   	In my view, Wright was confident of the soundness of his
judgment as to the future direction of the cattle industry in Australia.
 I am
also satisfied that he was confident in the wisdom of a policy of the
acquisition of properties, financed fully from borrowings
on the security of
the very substantial assets under his control and which he considered to be
considerably underutilised. 
<P>

117   	I am equally satisfied that, absent that support, Wright
would have sought, and obtained, however regretfully, facilities
from another
bank or lending institution. 
<P>

118   	As examined in these reasons, the financial crisis that,
in time, confronted the group was a combination, in my view, of
heady support
by the bank of the group's expansion; the adverse affects of a persistent,
severe and, in this case, disastrous drought;
an ambitious expansion of the
group's grazing interests by way of fully bank financed acquisitions of major
pastoral holdings; and
a failed marketing venture with Coles New World
Supermarket (Coles).  Not unreasonably, Wright saw himself as pursuing a
business
strategy that would see the Wrights as Australia's pre-eminent
pastoralists, or as gaining dominance in eastern Australia.  
<P>

119   	I think that the bank's role in that crisis should not be
underestimated.  At each step along the way until the first half
of 1991, the
bank lent significant support to Wright in the pursuit of his ambitious
business strategies, which involved increased
indebtedness to the bank.
<P>

120   	On 24 October 1995, Roger Fenton (Fenton), whose
designation with the bank was that of group general manager, recorded his
views
to Buckley on the bank's role in the group's straitened financial circumstances
in the following terms:
<P>

"From my reading of the Wrights (sic) response their shift in attitude to an
acceptance of the Banks (sic) revised stance is heartening
&amp; more
accommodating than I anticipated.  
<P>

They have given quite considerably - which must have caused some internal hurt;
however, it provides a framework in which to go
forward together &amp; we
should do this on a client/Banker relationship basis, after all the Wrights did
not get to the crippling
exposure without the <u>bank facilitation</u>.  I am
of the view that provided they achieve what is required then this could be a
success story for the Region &amp; the Bank.
<P>

This is a powerful family who are one of the Banks (sic) oldest continuous
clients if not the oldest, &amp; in my view we should
not alienate totally a
relationship that has been &amp; probably continue to be very worthwhile to the
Bank despite some personality
differences that no doubt have occurred in the
past &amp; will occur in the future - before &amp; past current players on both
sides.
 We should accept their compromise in good grace &amp; get on with the
relationship - but mainting (sic) control.  In act of good
faith, - I would
support marginal reduction in rate.
<P>

- not closing off hope of interim support provided it is clearly in both
interests to do so &amp; can be seen as a viable proposition.
<P>

- we were criticised as a Bank in not showing an interest in properties - I
understand &amp; accept reasons from our side at the
time - this should be
rectified at a convenient time when free from undue influences/pressures.  I
would be happy to participate
if Region manager saw any value in doing so.
<P>

Happy to discuss any of above.
<P>

In view of level negotiations of 6/10 &amp; areas covered it may be appropriate
for JB (or RNF) to sign our mutually agreed formal
response."
<P>

121   	I regard that as a reasonably realistic acknowledgment by
senior management of the situation that the bank had allowed to
arise.  
<P>

122   	For the reasons that I have so far given I am satisfied
that there was no fiduciary relationship existing between the group
and the
bank.  Conventionally, the banker/customer relationship is not a recognised
category of fiduciary relationship.  I am satisfied
that the comparatively
unique circumstances which, I think, attached to this relationship were not of
a kind that elevated a conventional
commercial banker/customer relationship
into one into which was imported a fiduciary element. 
<P>

123   	In final submissions the case on behalf of the group for
breach of fiduciary duty was put as follows:
<P>

"It may be there is no fiduciary duty arising from the relationship between
PAWS and the Bank.  However, with respect to the issues
in these proceedings,
at the very least there was a fiduciary obligation owing by the Bank to PAWS
similar to the obligations owed
by joint venturers, <cite>UDC v Brian Pty
Limited</cite> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=157%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">157 CLR 1."</a>
<P>

124   	However, I think it is clear from the evidence that the
relationship between the bank and the group, more particularly PAWS,
was not
analogous to a joint venture or quasi-partnership such as to warrant the
importation of a fiduciary element of the nature
contemplated in <b>United
Dominions</b>.  I think that much is reasonably clear from the nature of the
relationship at the time of the June meeting and becomes clearer from
the
nature of the dealings that took place in following years.
<P>

125   	I am also satisfied that the representation case, based
upon the June meeting communications, fails upon the issue of reliance.
 In
that context, I note a typescript error at line 54 of transcript 1682 where the
word "seemed" has been recorded in error for
the word "need".  
<P>

126   	I am satisfied for the reasons so far expressed that
Wright was committed to an expansion strategy which had at its core:
<P>

(a)	the exploitation of what he considered was to be underutilised group
assets, by recourse to their security value for borrowed
funds.
<P>

(b)	Wright's confidence in his judgment of the effect of the depletion of the
national herd which, in his mind, provided the potential
for rewards to the
owners of large breeding herds as a source of replenishing the shortfall in the
national herd.
<P>

(c)	Wright's objective to extend the group's control over the beef supply chain
from breeding, processing and sale of beef to retail
outlets.  Wright envisaged
that such control would immunise the group from the vicissitudes in beef
commodity prices at the various
points of supply.
<P>

127   	I am unable to reconcile Wright's expressed belief that
he would not have embarked upon this strategy without assurance of
bank support
with the view I have formed of his commitment to an expansion strategy for the
group.  It was not a case of impulsive,
ad hoc decision making.  He possessed a
wealth of industry knowledge and had formed the judgment that the group was in
a unique position
to capitalise on the commercial implications of historically
low numbers in the national cattle herd.
<P>

128   	I accept that the Wrights sought and obtained the general
imprimatur of the bank for the change in the group's commercial
strategy
outlined by them at the June meeting to the point where the group could
confidently anticipate the provision of loan funds
by the bank, upon acceptable
commercial terms, to facilitate the implementation of that strategy:  that
blips of financial setbacks
would be met sympathetically by the bank in the
provision of adequate working capital, but no more than that.
<P>

129   	I am satisfied that Wright was intent on keeping the bank
informed of the direction in which the group was heading and the
reasons
therefor.  I have no doubt that he did not want to be in a position where the
bank was opposed to the group's commercial
decisions.  In that sense, I think
it is true to say that Wright was not in a position to embark upon a dramatic
expansion of the
group's operations without that support of the bank.  However,
had the bank withheld that support, it is equally clear that the Wrights
would
have, with regret, gone elsewhere for the required funding.
<P>

130   	If one has regard to a) the circumstances in which the
June meeting was held, including the history of the group's dealings
with the
bank in the preceding twelve months; b) the absence of any forewarning to the
bank of the group's strategy outlined by the
Wrights at the June meeting; c)
the absence from that discussion of any dollar figures which could have given
any inkling of the
magnitude of the increased indebtedness that the Wrights may
have had in contemplation; d) the simplistic nature of the financial
analysis
presented by David Wright at the June meeting; e) the very concept in that
analysis of a gradual breeding herd build-up
from natural increase on the
group's existing holdings; f) the magnitude of the commitments later undertaken
by the group, I think
it flies in the face of reality to construct on Punch's
statements at the June meeting a case of reliance sufficient to found an
equitable estoppel against the bank in relation to those commitments.
<P>

131   	Furthermore, in my view, the nature of Punch's
statements, and the circumstances in which they were made at the June meeting
fall short of the standards which equity demands of a case of promissory
estoppel.
<P>

132   	In particular, the representations relied upon must be
clear.  Of that requirement it was said in the joint judgment of Masons
and
Deane JJ in <b>Legione v Hateley </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%2d1983%29%20152%20CLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982-1983) 152 CLR 406</a> at 436 as
follows:
<P>

"The requirement that a representation must be clear before it can found an
estoppel is, in our view, applicable to any doctrine
of promissory estoppel
(see <i>Woodhouse A.C. Israel Cocoa Ltd. S.A. v. Nigerian Produce Marketing Co.
Ltd.;  China-Pacific S.A. v. Food Corporation of India</i>.  In the
<i>Woodhouse Case</i> Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone L.C. (with whose speech
Lord Pearson agreed) commented:
<P>

"Counsel for the appellants was asked whether he knew of any case in which an
ambiguous statement had ever formed the basis of a
purely promissory estoppel,
as contended for here, as distinct form estoppel of a more familiar type based
on factual misrepresentation.
 He candidly replied that he did not.  I do not
find this surprising, since it would really be an astonishing thing if, in the
case
of a genuine misunderstanding as to the meaning of an offer, the offeree
could obtain by means of the doctrine of promissory estoppel
something that he
must fail to obtain under the conventional law of contract.  I share the
feeling of incredulity expressed by Lord
Denning M.R. in the course of his
judgment in the instant case when he said:  `If the judge be right, it leads to
this extraordinary
consequence:  A letter which is not sufficient to
<i>vary</i> a contract is, nevertheless, sufficient to work an <i>estoppel
</i>- which will have the same effect as a <i>variation</i>.'"
<P>

In the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning M.R. had proceeded to refer to the higher
standard of clarity required of a promissory representation
relied upon to
found an estoppel if compared with that required when a representation is put
forward as an agreed variation of contract:
<P>

"...  If the representation is put forward as a <i>variation</i>, and is fairly
capable of one or other of two meanings, the judge will decide between those
two meanings and say which is right.
 But, if it is put forward as an
<i>estoppel</i>, the judge will not decide between the two meanings.  He will
reject it as an estoppel because it is not precise and unambiguous.
 There is
good sense in this difference.  When a contract is varied by correspondence, it
is an <i>agreed </i>variation.  It is the duty of the court to give effect to
the agreement if it possibly can:  and it does so by resolving ambiguities,
no
matter how difficult it may be.  But, when a man is <i>estopped</i>, he has not
agreed to anything.  Quite the reverse.  He is stopped from telling the truth.
He should not be stopped on an ambiguity.
 To work an estoppel, the
representation must be clear and unequivocal.  That is clear from <i>Low v.
Bouverie</i> and <i>Canadian and Dominion Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Canadian National
(West Indies) Steamships Ltd</i>."
<P>

The second of those rules is that a person will not be estopped from departing
from an assumption or a representation "unless, as
a result of adopting it as
the basis of action or inaction, the other party will have placed himself in a
position of material disadvantage
if departure from the assumption be
permitted" (per Dixon J. in <i>Thompson v. Palmer</i>; and see <i>Tool Metal
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Tungsten Electric Co. Ltd.</i>; <i>Grundt's Case;
Fontana N.V. v. Mautner</i>).  Again, we are of the view that this general rule
is applicable to any doctrine of promissory estoppel (see <i>Ajayi v. R. T.
Briscoe (Nigeria) Ltd.</i>; Spencer Bower and Turner, <i>Estoppel by
Representation</i>, 3rd ed. (1977), pp. 391-394)."
<P>

133   	It then remains to consider the group's representation
case in the circumstances in which the rapid increase in borrowings
took place
in 1990.  The nature and extent of those borrowings are captured in the terms
of the bank's schedule of facilities of
2 January 1991 as follows:

<P>

<u>Security</u>
<P>

As security for total facilities, the Bank will continue to rely upon the
following:-
<P>

-	Cross Deed of Covenant by and between:-
<P>

	-	Phillip David Arundell Wright 
<P>

	-	Margaret du Moulin Wright 
<P>

	-	P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty. Limited
<P>

	-	Wallamumbi Pty. Limited 
<P>

	-	Achill Pty. Limited

<P>

	-	Registered Mortgage over "Thorpleigh" property.
<P>

	-	Registered Mortgages over titles in the name of Ostabrew Pty Limited over
Boonaldoon property.
<P>

	-	Registered Mortgage Debenture over P A Wright &amp; Sons Pty Limited.
<P>

With regard to the above requirements, the Bank's <u>minimum</u> security cover
required during the term of all loans provided to P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty.
Limited and associated parties equates
to a security/loan ratio of 130% i.e.
$10 of debt requires $13 of security.  In this regard when assessing security
values the following
will apply:-
<P>

i)	Valuation of properties is to be assessed at their then current market
valuation and in line with the Bank's assessed "Fair Market
Value".
<P>

ii)	Value of stock is also to be assessed at the then current market value
discounted by a factor of 60% i.e. if cattle were valued
at $400 per head
security value would be $240 when assessing security/loan ratio as above.
<P>

Additional facilities provided have resulted in this requirement no longer
being met.  At current lending level security cover needs
to equate to $39.8M
which equates to a shortfall of some $3.9M
<P>

I am confident that this situation can be resolved quickly on these figures do
not include Thorpleigh or Kindon which should add
a further $3.3M cover.
Please contact me to discuss this matter further as you may not be aware that
current security documentation
and agreements relative to Kindon and Wondul
properties are not yet completed to the satisfaction of the Bank.
<P>

<u>Monitoring</u>
<P>

The Bank will require quarterly (31/3; 30/6; 30/9 and 31/12) performance to
budget cash flows to be provided in addition to the
end of month stock
schedules now provided.
<P>

Please note that cash flow performance figures are to be provided by the end of
the month following the reporting date e.g. 30/6
data required by 31/7 with
monthly stock schedules required by the 15th of the following month e.g. 31/8
data due by 15/9 ...".
<P>

134   	It will be seen that all of the principal facilities are
described as "basic", representing $21,150,000 of a total of $30,633,000.
Further that $21,150,000 represented a "terminating line" which had been
converted to "basic".  In my view, for reasons that follow,
that record is the
clearest contractual evidence of the bank's support of the commercial
undertakings to which the group became committed
or embarked upon in 1990:  it
is the strongest corroborative evidence of the expressions of support by Punch
of the group's preparedness
to take on a dramatically increased debt burden in
1990.
<P>

135   	How that situation came about may be placed in context by
an examination of the dealings between the group and the bank in
the
intervening period following the June meeting.  On 20 October 1988, Nicholls
forwarded to the bank notes by way of adjustment
to a cashflow budget which the
Wrights had provided previously to the bank.  Of interest, I think, in that
facsimile, is the schedule
of livestock numbers provided as being of possible
"assistance in (the bank's) assessment of the current livestock plan".  One
assumes
that the reference to a "current livestock plan" was a reference to the
Wrights' plan to expand the breeding herd.  I think of particular
significance
in that schedule are the figures provided for "Natural Increase" and the
figures for stock on hand as at 30 June provided
in respect of the actual
figures for the year ended 30 June 1988 and as budgeted for the year ended 30
June 1989.  Those figures
showed a growth in the natural increase from 6,063 to
8,708 and stock on hand at 18,322 and 24,092 respectively.
<P>

136   	That increase was described by Nicholls as being the
result of the "breeder proportion of the group's herd (continuing) to
increase
...".  Although the figures are obscured to some extent by the opportunistic
purchases budgeted for the year ended 30 June
1989, I think the sales figures
are consistent with the earlier disposal of steers contemplated in the change
in breeding herd outlined
by the Wrights at the June meeting.  
<P>

137   	I think the diary note of 21 October 1988 signed off by
Punch is noteworthy for a number of reasons:  
<P>

1)	It reflected Wright's willingness to take the Wright group further into debt
by seeking increased facilities for a fully financed
property purchase, in this
instance, a beach property at South West Rocks.
<P>

2)	Recognition is recorded by the bank that the accounting standards adopted in
the group's financials utilised an averaging costs
method for the valuing of
the herd and an historic costs method for land and buildings.  In noting that
shareholders funds had moved
further into deficit by approximately $1,000,000
for the year ended 30 June 1988, it was observed that adoption of market value
would
see the "current shareholders funds deficit transfer to a surplus of
$3,928,000".
<P>

3)	The favourable reception recorded by Punch of the proposal for increased
borrowing which in his view could be "approved without
further additional
security (and) could be easily incorporated within the Bank's existing ratios
at QSV to lending". 
<P>

138   	Punch observed in recommending the bank's approval of the
increased facilities that the "Bank can rest comfortably with adequate
security
held and (with) the fact that over the past 12 months the company, although
reporting a loss, has not had to arrange increased
financing to cover its
operating losses".  
<P>

139   	The annual review of the group account was conducted by
Punch and Armstrong on 23 November 1988.  The bank's diary note of
that review
noted that the profit and loss figures of the group showed a loss to the group
of nearly $1,000,000 for the year ended
30 June 1988 and the gradually
increasing level of indebtedness of the group.  However, in line with the
change in strategy outlined
at the June meeting, there was a forecast reduction
in debt at the end of the financial year of over $2,200,000.  I think of
particular
interest is the following diary summary note:
<P>

"Notwithstanding possible variations to cashflow caused by market fluctuations
it appears that Mr Wright is now in a position to
capitalise on his strategy of
building herd numbers."
<P>

140   	While this could be seen as a reference to the 1987
approach by Wright of generally building up herd numbers, taking advantage
of
the perceived national herd shortage, I am more inclined to the view that it is
also a further reflection of the 30 June 1988
strategy, particularly in the
context of Nicholls' facsimile of 20 October 1988 referring to the increase in
the "breeder proportion"
of the herd.  
<P>

141   	Wright gave a detailed description of this annual review
meeting which, in substance, I accept.  I think the emphasis is
on the
substance of that evidence, as the detail of the discussion, as provided in the
evidence of Wright, would be beyond normal
recollection.  However, I am
satisfied that Punch was informed of the method of accounting adopted by the
group in its financials
and that it was likely that Wright confirmed the 1989
figures would be boosted by the sale of bullocks and stud dispersal as part
of
the move towards a build-up of female numbers.  I also accept that Wright
explored with Punch the use of the group's interest
in Kindon as a security for
further borrowing.
<P>

142   	Throughout 1988 it is apparent that the group's interest
in Melrose was a matter of concern to the bank.  Melrose was referred
to as
amounting to "nothing more than pouring money into a bottomless bucket".
Throughout these proceedings the Wrights continued
to maintain that the
investment in Melrose had been a prudent and successful one.  That is a view
that I think can only be sustained
on the basis of the experience it gave the
Wrights in relation to the slaughtering and boning process phase of beef
marketing.  From
a cold financial viewpoint it clearly was a costly exercise in
racking up debts in 1988, eventually requiring the Wrights to take
complete
control of the asset in 1989 - again at a cost which the group seeks to lay at
the door of the bank in these proceedings.
 
<P>

143   	At the beginning of the calendar year 1989, Wright was
faced with the decision of getting out of Melrose and "cutting his
losses" or
taking it over.  It was decided in January to adopt the latter course.  That
was accompanied by a foreshadowed requirement
of increased facilities of
$500,000 for working capital to support that operation.  That additional
facility was approved on 27 January
1989 in the sum of $520,000 described as
"basic and subject to Annual Review".  With that change in interest in Melrose,
it was decided
that the account, which had previously operated from the bank's
Queensland sector, should come under the control of Punch.  
<P>

144   	The history of the group's involvement and investment in
Melrose, which predated the June meeting, places the commitment
well outside
the boundary of the group's representation case.  On any view of the group's
case, it is quite inappropriate to characterise
those commercial decisions of
the group as ones for which the bank bears responsibility.  For reasons later
addressed, I place this
head of claim in the same box as the group's claim for
losses said to have been occasioned by negligent advice of the bank leading
to
the group taking out a fixed interest loan.  
<P>

145   	The bank's security appendix dated 27 January 1989
presumably related to the provision of the Melrose facility last referred
to.
I think it is a record of some significance, given the criticism of the group's
rural operations offered by the bank's expert
witnesses in these
proceedings.
<P>

146   	In general terms, the appendix described the group's
grazing properties as being well improved, well maintained and not suffering
from evidence of mismanagement, for example, in the form of erosion, noxious
weeds or vermin.  Improvements were all noted as being
in good or excellent
condition.  It was noted that all properties had been inspected by the bank's
rural services manager on 1 September
1988.  
<P>

147   	The formal letter of approval of facilities following the
annual review was that of 31 January 1989 which showed a total
limit of
$11,095,000.  Interest rates were high, around the 17% mark.  It included an
indemnity guarantee in the sum of $290,000
provided in support of Wright's
underwriting membership of Lloyds.
<P>

148   	In my view, nothing is more indicative of the commercial
ambitions of Wright at the times relevant to the subject matter
of these
proceedings than the letter of Punch to Wright of 7 February 1989 which is set
out in full below:
<P>

"Dear David,
<P>

I refer to our recent discussions concerning the possibility of your acquiring
various farming interests for a consideration of
approximately one hundred
million dollars ($100,000,000).
<P>

The ANZ Bank, in its capacity as principal banker to your company, is prepared
to give favourable consideration to financing proposals
connected with the
above acquisition.   Financing would of course be subject to satisfactory
credit assessment and in particular
the financial considerations and viability
of the assets being acquired.
<P>

To assist with your ongoing deliberations in this matter and should proposed
vendors or their bankers require further information
in regard to the above
please feel free to contact me on (02) 227-1810.
<P>

Regards,
<P>

J.R. Punch"
<P>

149   	Although the letter is clearly one solicited by Wright,
it is in terms which I think reflect the very considerable support
which the
bank was prepared to consider seriously in connection with Wright's expansion
ambitions for the group.
<P>

150   	The letter was tied up with Wright's interest in a joint
venture with Cargill Australia Limited (Cargill) as part of his
plan to take a
prominent position in the whole production line in the marketing of beef.  At
that time, an American based organisation
known as King Ranch had placed its
Australian grazing properties on the market for tender and Wright estimated
that a successful
buyer would be looking at approximately $100,000,000.  It is
his evidence that he conveyed this to Punch in the following way:
<P>

"The effect of such a joint venture would be that the production of our NSW
cattle herds would be relocated onto the Kindon property
after we had acquired
full ownership of it and the production of the King Ranch herd from North
Queensland would also be relocated
on Kindon.  The joint venture would
establish greenfields abattoir at Inglewood, which is a small township near the
Kindon boundary.
 Kindon could then act as a depot to supply the abattoir 52
weeks of the year.  The product would then go to Brisbane for distribution
into
the chain stores in the other capital cities, on the one hand or go into export
for distribution via Cargill's International
network to both USA, Japan and
elsewhere."
<P>

151   	Wright envisaged Cargill as going into such a venture on
a 50/50 basis.  According to Wright's evidence, this possible direction
in the
affairs of the group was discussed by him with Punch and met with enthusiasm.
I am reasonably satisfied that the substance
of Wright's evidence on this
matter is correct and that Punch has a poor recollection of the discussion.  I
am satisfied that, in
broad terms, Wright's interest in that set of assets and
his general proposal for Cargill were made known by him to Punch prior to
Punch's letter of 7 February 1989.
<P>

152   	Wright was in contact with Cargill representatives about
this time and I am satisfied that he kept the bank generally informed
of what
was going on.  Later in the year, Wright visited the United States to discuss
his plans with the representatives of Cargill's
parent corporation.  It was his
evidence, which I accept, that on his return he kept Punch informed of
developments.   
<P>

153   	In any event, the evidence of Wright in relation to his
disclosure of joint venture proposals to Punch, represent a good
indication of
the magnitude of Wright's plans, which, if commercially sound, would have
offered considerable rewards to the group
and, I expect, would have been
extremely attractive to the bank.  
<P>

154   	The acquisition of the King Ranch properties was the
subject of preliminary discussions with the bank at a meeting on 13
June 1989
attended by Punch, Armitage, Wright, ANZ McCaughans and Charles O'Neill, a
commercial associate and financial adviser to
Wright.  The subject holding
comprised some nine properties spread throughout Queensland and the Northern
Territory amounting to
approximately 7,900,000 acres.  Wright was working on
acquisition costs of approximately $100,000,000, to be reduced by subdivision
and resale of part of the property known as Tully Station after a development
period of two years.  Acquisition alternatives were
listed as follows:
<P>

"i)	Acquisition to be financed to maximum allowed under security valuations and
servicing capacity.  Shortfall would need to be
covered by equity injection.
<P>

ii)	Divestment of Tully River Station with residual properties being able to
service debt levels of approx. $40mio (to be confirmed).
<P>

iii)	         Possibility of a public float being used to raise capital.
<P>

iv)	        Introduction of equity partners as identified through ANZ
McCaughans."
<P>

155   	An extraordinary feature of the proposal was the time
frame of four weeks in which the bank was being asked to perform. 
This, and
like proposals of Wright, demonstrated the high stakes with which he was
playing and the extent to which he was prepared
to expose the group's
assets.
<P>

156   	Wright maintained an interest in joining with Cargill in
the venture and this was conveyed to the bank.  Details of the possible
joint
venture were furnished by Punch to the Chicago office of the bank for the
purpose of verifying the capacity of Cargill's parent
to provide a standby
letter of credit for $40,000,000 and, eventually, equity capital of $50,000,000
by July 1990. 
<P>

157   	By letter of 7 July 1989 to Wright, Punch set out the
nature of the proposal as understood by him as a record "to express
the Bank's
interest in considering the proposal outline".  A fee of $25,000 was noted by
the bank as the cost of its involvement
in establishing financial facilities to
support the proposed tender for the King Ranch properties.  
<P>

158   	The attraction of the proposal to the bank, I think, is
captured in its letter to Wright of 14 July 1989 in which the bank
confirmed
that it had "indicated a strong interest in the provision of a substantial
Australian dollar facility to assist the joint
venturers named ... to tender"
for the King Ranch properties.  That letter concluded with the following:
<P>

"ANZ is delighted to have been approached to be involved in this prestigious
project and trust that you can develop your discussions
with the principals of
King Ranch Inc. thus enabling us to make an offer to finance the joint
venture's funding needs."
<P>

159   	By the end of July, the proposal involving King Ranch and
Cargill had faltered and this was confirmed in the bank's letter
to Wright of
22 August 1989.  While that proposal did not eventuate, it is clear that Wright
continued to pursue his interest in
a joint venture with Cargill.  The bank's
attitude to that continued interest was recorded as follows:
<P>

"We have ... been advised by David Wright that (Cargill) are still extremely
interested in acquiring similar types of operations
to King Ranch in Australia
thereby giving a strategic holding to assist with the company's thrust into
South East Asian beef markets.
 It is planned for (Cargill) ... executive to
visit Australia within the next month and we have requested that the Bank be
placed
on their calling programme so that we may express our interest in
assisting with any funding needs that Cargill may require."
<P>

160   	The Wrights, in the these proceedings, have placed
considerable emphasis on the interest expressed by the bank in providing
major
facilities in support of the group's joint venture plans and I think the
Wrights were justified in their expectation that significant
further borrowings
would be made available to the group to assist in other expansion of the
group's commercial interests.
<P>

161   	Consistent with that expectation, Wright brought to the
bank, in early 1989, a proposal involving the acquisition by him
of an abattoir
business in Dorrigo in New South Wales for which a further $750,000 facility
was required.  It is clear that Punch
supported the provision of that facility,
if required:  although others in the bank were, clearly, less than impressed
with the commercial
soundness of the proposition for reasons which I think were
very persuasive.  A similar proposal was brought forward by Wright in
September
1989 seeking a further facility of $1,000,000 for Esrolem, which had been
incorporated by the Wrights with the view to
involvement in beef wholesaling in
association with Melrose.  That proposal was also favourably viewed by the
bank.
<P>

162   	One further feature of 1989 lies in the excess overdraft
position created by Wright.  In March 1989 the excess was approximately
$300,000.  According to Wright, he had a conversation with Punch at that time.
He explained to Punch that the change in herd structure
had "exacerbated our
cashflow position until such time as" a dispersal sale of steers had taken
place.  According to Wright he informed
Punch, at that time, as follows:
<P>

"I find it curious that you should be questioning us as I believe we are
absolutely on line with the commencement of the 10 year
programme as indicated
last June.  John, I remind you again that we are anticipating a substantial
shortfall in cashflow from reduced
sales from now until at least 1993 ...".
<P>

163   	According to Wright, Punch had stated that he understood
the position and recognised that an excess situation was likely
to be repeated.
I have some difficulty in accepting the accuracy of that statement in so far as
the facility provided in January
1989 envisaged the reduction in the overdraft
to $200,000 in March of 1989.  Far from the change in strategy causing an
excess in
the overdraft account in early 1989, I think it is reasonably clear
that at the annual review and, subsequently, Wright anticipated
a reduction in
overdraft in the 1989 year.  
<P>

164   	At the same time, I have no doubt that Punch conveyed to
Wright the willingness of the bank to accommodate the group's temporary
excess.
Indeed, given Punch's view about the safety of the lending, it is difficult to
understand why the temporary excess would
not be accommodated.  In fact that is
what occurred at the end of the 1989 calendar year with a $400,000 excess
accommodated by an
approval on 22 December 1989 of an additional bill facility
of $500,000 until 15 February 1990.  I note that the interest rate at
that time
was 21%.  
<P>

165   	The final bank record of the calendar year 1989 noted
that the May 1989 update of PAWS' herd movements were based on assumptions
which included "Heifer Retention" in relation to various herd groups in the
vicinity of 80%:  further confirmation, in my view, 
of the change that was
taking place in the herd structure of the group's operations.
<P>

166   	The movement in borrowings by the group in 1990 is
reflected in the facilities limit of $11,541,960 as at January 1990 and
a limit
at 2 January 1991 of $30,633,000.  
<P>

167   	In my view, the events of 1990 should be viewed on the
basis that the decisions of Wright which led to this increased indebtedness
were consistent with the general thrust of the strategy as revealed to the bank
in 1987 and at the June meeting.  However, in no
realistic sense, were they
decisions made in reliance upon Punch's statements at the June meeting.  The
only real reliance was that
which led the Wrights to look to the bank for the
required facilities in 1990 rather than some other institution.  It is the
uncontradicted
evidence of Punch that substantial funds would have been
available to the group from major lending institutions had the group been
minded to obtain finance elsewhere. 
<P>

168   	The bank's credit memorandum of 15 March 1990 evidenced
that a ten year projection had been provided by PAWS which showed
a break up of
the group's herd and, in particular, included a breeding herd model.  In
relation to projected cashflow, it was noted
as follows:
<P>

"Cattle income in 1990 is greater than 1991 due to the changes in herd
structure (increasing heifer numbers for breeding rather
than steer numbers)
requiring dispersal of part of the Hereford Stud herd at $400,000 and 1,880
head of yearling steers ...".
<P>

169   	Punch's recommendation was as follows:
<P>

"Given the satisfactory trading performance for FYE 6/89, projected improving
position for current and future years and the fully
secured position of PAW's
debts extension of facilities for a further term has been recorded.
<P>

It is worthy of note that PAW itself is constantly on the lookout for possible
acquisitions that would enhance existing operations
and such would necessitate
100% finance being provided.  Our continued involvement with PAW will no doubt
prove very beneficial to
both the company and the Bank and provided the
benefits/profitability of any intended acquisition can adequately demonstrate a
viable
farming operation it is our intention to support such transactions."
<P>

170   	There is no doubt, in my view, that that support was
conveyed to Wright by Punch during 1990.
<P>

171   	In similar terms is the credit memorandum of 17 April
1990.  The general remarks recommending increased facilities noted
the
following:
<P>

"As part of P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty. Limited (PAW) ongoing strategy of
gearing up for increased supply of Australian beef into
South East Asia, as
well as for continuation of supply to traditional export and local markets,
David Wright is constantly on the
lookout for additional properties to enable
sizeable increases to be built up in his herd breeding numbers.  A substantial
part of
this strategy involves possible joint venture property acquisitions
with Cargill Inc (USA) and a copy of PAW's concept paper in this
regard was
attached to BIR at last advices."
<P>

172   	I think the "concept paper" was that which was supplied
to the bank by PAWS on 9 November 1989.  That "concept paper" noted
that the
outlined strategy "should in no way be regarded as superseding the original
concept of acquiring over time and developing
selected livestock breeding
enterprises (a la King Ranch) which, because of the built in benefits and lead
time required should run
in parallel with the proposed subject matter of this
paper".  
<P>

173   	The concept paper then set out five steps.  The first
envisaged the construction of a "modern hi-tech" abattoir.  Step two
involved
the acquisition of the outstanding interest in Kindon and the establishment of
a feedlot with a capacity of approximately
2,500 head per week, which involved
a total head capacity of 20,000 to 30,000 - no small enterprise.  Step three
related to the acquisition
of land for a "small, ... hi-tech modular
feedlot/abattoir".  Step four envisaged an aquaculture enterprise in
conjunction with the
feedlot/abattoir and step five involved the identification
and acquisition of additional properties to provide the required livestock.

<P>

174   	It was noted that the scheme requirements were in the
vicinity of 100,000 to 150,000 head of cattle per annum "ready as required
for
entry into feedlot".  What was envisaged and disclosed to the bank was a
multi-million dollar scheme on a scale of considerable
magnitude.  I have no
doubt, as Wright has given evidence, that these concepts of the group's
strategy impressed Punch and elicited
favourable indications of the bank's
interest in providing loan funds to assist in the implementation of these
objectives. 
<P>

175   	There is no doubt in my mind that Wright's commitment to
expansion of the group's operations was intense and taken in the
knowledge that
the bank would favourably consider the provision of loan funds sufficient to
satisfy costs of acquisition of properties,
subject to acceptable commercial
terms.  
<P>

176   	The relationship between the bank and the Wrights during
1990 was one of general support by the bank for the dramatic expansion
in the
activities of the group.  The major commitments involved the acquisition of
Boonaldoon together with its related livestock,
plant and equipment;
substantial opportunistic stock purchases; the acquisition of Thorpleigh; beef
supply arrangements entered into
with Coles and the bringing of the Melrose
account into the fold of the group account.  Underlying those activities there
was continued
interest by Wright in yet further major property acquisitions
which, as it happened, did not eventuate.  
<P>

177   	A convenient starting point for the examination of the
circumstances relating to the group's acquisitions, I think, is Punch's
diary
note of 29 January 1990.  It reviewed the objectives of the "concept paper"
provided by Wright concerning the possible Cargill
joint venture and noted the
continued interest of Wright in the Dorrigo abattoir together with the
possibility of the purchase of
Boonaldoon and yet anther property, Kotupna, a
property of approximately 2,500 acres in the vicinity of Wallamumbi.  It was
estimated
that it would command a price of approximately $3,750,000.
<P>

178   	The prospect of the Boonaldoon purchase was presented to
Punch either at the end of 1989, or, more likely, in January 1990
and there
followed the submission of details by Wright to the bank concerning this
proposed acquisition and that of Kotupna.
<P>

179   	Wright saw the envisaged acquisitions as part of the
possible creation of a joint venture with Cargill or as acquisitions
by the
group, in the event that agreement was not reach with Cargill.  I think this
much is clear from the letters of Armitage, as
manager, corporate banking, to
the senior vice president of the Chicago branch of the bank and from the bank
to Wright each of 12
February 1990.  Armitage's letter was as follows:  
<P>

"<b>BANK OPINION ON P.A. WRIGHT &amp; SONS PTY. LIMITED</b>
<P>

We have been requested to provide an opinion on the abovementioned company's
capacity to source financing of up to AUD25 Million
for the acquisition of a
yet to be identified grazing property/ies.
<P>

P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty. Limited, of which David Wright is the principal, is
a long established and internationally recognised
family pastoral company
owning and operating eight cattle and sheep properties in northern New South
Wales carrying approximately
25,000 cattle and 50,000 sheep.  Family operations
have been associated with the ANZ Bank and its precursors for over 140
years.
<P>

P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty. Limited, is seen to be trading profitably and
expertise of principal suggests this position will continue.
<P>

We consider the company safe for normal trade engagements.  Principal of
company would be unlikely to enter the company into a commitment
it could not
fulfil including the aforementioned acquisition.  Finance would of course be
subject to satisfying the normal considerations
of viability etc. essential in
such an acquisition.
<P>

The information furnished and the opinions expressed herein, which are subject
to change without notice, are supplied in strict
confidence in answer to your
request and are to be used or availed of only on the condition that no
responsibility in connection
therewith shall attach to this Bank or any of its
officers and on the understanding that our name will not be disclosed as the
source
of information."
<P>

180   	The bank's letter to Wright stated:
<P>

"<b><u>ACQUISITION OF BOONALDOON STATION</u></b>
<P>

I refer to our recent discussion concerning the proposed Joint Venture
acquisition of the abovementioned property which is situated
44 kilometres west
of Moree and comprises some 14,803 hectares.
<P>

Whilst we have been advised the acquisition would proceed on a Joint Venture
basis it is understood that P.A. Wright &amp; Sons
Pty. Limited may at a later
date be seeking refinance of the total project.  ANZ Bank in its capacity as
principal banker to your
various company enterprises for well over 100 years is
prepared to give favourable consideration to financing proposals connected
with
this or any other acquisition.  Finance would of course be subject to
satisfying the normal considerations of viability etc.
essential in such an
acquisition.
<P>

Should you or your proposed Joint Venturers wish to further discuss our
possible involvement in this project please do not hesitate
to contact me.  
<P>

181   	It is not difficult to identify the basis for the choice
of $25,000,000 in the bank's comfort letter of 12 February 1990.
 Immediately
prior to the provision of that letter, David Wright, at the request of Wright,
had prepared a financial projection for
four properties, namely: Boonaldoon;
Jambaroo Station, a property of some 4,235 acres estimated to cost $360 an
acre; Burraki Station,
a property of 8,500 acres, estimated to cost $390 an
acre and Kotupna of $1,200 an acre.  Boonaldoon Station at $150 an acre made
up
a total estimated cost of those properties of approximately $25,000,000.  
<P>

182   	Those projections, in the case of Jambaroo, showed a net
profit after tax for all of the thirteen years of projections except
the first,
with retirement of the debt in 1998 and an increase in net worth from the
negative figure of approximately $435,000 at
the commencement of the period to
$7,452,804 by year 2003.  A similar presentation was reflected in the Burraki
Station analysis.
 In that instance, the net worth was shown as increasing from
a negative figure of approximately $860,000 at the commencement of
the period
to a net value of $15,690,178 at the end of the period.  In the case of
Boonaldoon, the same progression in wealth was
demonstrated, with a net profit
after tax in each of the years forecast, apart from the first, and an increase
in net worth from
a negative figure at the commencement of the period to a
value of $24,418,196 at the end of that period.  In the case of Kotupna,
the
assessment of net worth showed an increase of over $5,000,000 in that period.

<P>

183   	Wright gave evidence of his meetings and discussions with
Punch during early 1990 which included the bank's annual review
in February.
His evidence of conversations, now some several years past, is quite detailed
and, as before, I think one should approach
that evidence on the basis that the
substance of the communication should be accepted.  However, I have some doubt
about a reaffirmation
by Wright in that conversation of there being a shortfall
in cashflow for the following few years as a result of the group 1988 strategy,
given the optimistic cashflows provided to the bank about this time, to which
reference is later made in these reasons.  According
to Wright, Punch confirmed
the bank's likely support for the proposed acquisition of Boonaldoon. 
<P>

184   	David Wright also gave detailed evidence of the annual
review meeting.  While I accept the substance of his evidence, I think
one has
to be careful about the detail into which he goes, by reason of the fact that
it relates to conversations that took place
several years ago and of which he
had no contemporaneous record to aid his memory.  However, I think David
Wright's evidence established
that the bank was appraised of the objectives of
the Wright group in relation to the joint venture with Cargill and the role
which
Boonaldoon would play.  I think it also showed that projections relating
to the acquisition of properties at a cost of $25,000,000
were provided to the
bank's representatives at the meeting and that the bank supported, in
principle, the path that the Wrights were
embarking upon.  
<P>

185   	As stated, I have some hesitation in accepting that there
was a reference back to the strategy, the subject of discussion
at the June
meeting.  However, to the extent that there was any such reference, I regard
such an exchange as being of little value
in ascertaining the positions adopted
by the Wrights and the bank in 1990, it being more in the nature of background
references of
historical significance. 
<P>

186   	The annual review took place at Armidale between 12 and
14 February 1990 attended by Punch, Anton Archer and Armitage from
the bank.
Armitage's diary note of 12 February 1990, which was signed off by Punch,
recorded the activities involved in that review,
including inspection of
Wallamumbi and Paradise, and noted the substantial redevelopment which had been
undertaken since the bank's
last visit:  again a matter of significance when
contrasting these observations with the attack on management practices levelled
against the group in the bank's case.  
<P>

187   	The review continued at the offices of Roberts &amp;
Morrow.  The diary note of this meeting recorded the discussion concerning
the
acquisition of Boonaldoon and of other properties as follows:
<P>

"Mr. Wright was told that the Bank would not be in a position to give an answer
on the funding or otherwise of the property within
a period of some 4 hours and
that prior to any further funding considerations the Bank needed to be totally
comfortable with the
existing P.A. Wright &amp; sons Pty. Limited Group and its
capacity to service existing levels of debt.
<P>

At that time David Wright then informed executives present at the meeting that
they were considering acquisition of a number of
other properties and
individual sensitivity analysis were being undertaken.
<P>

We were later to be informed that P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty. Limited was
considering acquisition of the Kotupna property adjacent
to Ebor and
approximately 60kms from Wallamumbi Station.  Subject property was in a very
high rainfall area and was expected to command
a premium price." 
<P>

188   	There has been a considerable body of evidence, both
documentary and oral, concerning the presentation by Wright of the financial
implications of the purchase of Boonaldoon and Kotupna, leading up to the
Boonaldoon purchase.  I think it is sufficient to observe
that a number of
alternative financial analyses were supplied by Wright to the bank, some in
response to particular requests by the
bank, which included analyses at various
levels of the cost of acquisition.  A "worst case" analysis was included which,
in my view,
was intended to be equated with a downturn in operations, for
example, through the effect of drought.  
<P>

189   	I think it is fair to observe that each of these
assessments in varying degrees provided comfort to the bank that the group's
operations would not be adversely affected by the proposed acquisitions, that
they would enhance the viability of the existing operations
and be capable of
supporting the anticipated level of financial commitment involved in completing
these acquisitions.  
<P>

190   	An initial feasibility study of 1 February 1990 provided
for a loan repayment schedule on a premise of a purchase price of
$210 per acre
of Boonaldoon.  Except for the year 1990, that showed an ever increasing
surplus after interest from approximately
$360,000 to $4,500,000 in the year
2003.  In addition, it provided for principal repayments over a ten year period
with debt extinguished
in year ten.
<P>

191   	On 28 February 1990, David Wright forwarded two analyses
to the bank.  The parameters were set out in his letter to Punch
of 28
February.  One was a Boonaldoon Station financial assessment on a stand alone
basis, the other was on an amalgamated basis,
with all proposed and existing
borrowings dealt with.  The assessment of Boonaldoon on a stand alone basis at
a purchase price of
$180 an acre showed a net profit after tax after the first
year of approximately $211,000 increasing to $2,100,000 by the year 2000.
 It
also provided for capital repayments over an eight year period to extinguish
the loan.
<P>

192   	A not dissimilar analysis result was reflected in the
amalgamated projections, with each year revealing a substantial increase
in the
surplus after payment of interest and the extinguishment of losses being
carried forward after the third year.  A surplus
after tax was shown to be in
an ever increasing amount over the ten year projection.
<P>

193   	A further set of financials for the group was forwarded
by David Wright by another facsimile of 28 February 1990.  That was
based upon
existing indebtedness of approximately $11,500,000.  They showed a net profit
after tax of about $500,000 in the first
year, increasing to approximately
$3,400,000 in the fourth year and settling at about $5,600,000 in the tenth
year.  
<P>

194   	Similar projections were provided for Kotupna in early
March.  The stand alone projection for Kotupna at a purchase price
of $1,000 an
acre showed negative profit and loss situation throughout the ten year
analysis.  Other bases of projection showed a
net profit after tax commencing
in the seventh year with retirement of borrowing required for Kotupna being
achieved by year nine.
 
<P>

195   	There were many permutations and combinations of costs
and income in the acquisition and operation of Boonaldoon alone and
Boonaldoon
within the group's properties, all of which, in my view, show a capacity to
meet interest payments and, over time, a retirement
of the proposed facility.

<P>

196   	Of particular interest in that context, I think, is the
facsimile from Armitage to David Wright of 11 April 1990, clearly
sent for the
purpose of gaining further material for the upcoming credit memorandum of 17
April 1990, seeking approval of increased
facilities to enable the group to
acquire Boonaldoon.  The facsimile raised certain budget questions and then
included a requisition
of budgets described as follows:
<P>

"To date, I have a couple of queries with regard to my submission
<P>

1)	What is the timing of the new dam on the Gwydir
<P>

2)	Cost of purchase of irrigation licen. $200K
<P>

3)	    Income streams on budgets, to be provided, will need to be substantiated
especially sheep/lamb/wool income give current state
of the industry
<P>

4)	Budgets will be required as follows:
<P>

1)	P A Wright &amp; sons - Alone (Increase 5%pa)
<P>

2)	<u>P A Wright &amp; Sons - Worst Case prolong drought scenario</u>
<P>

The above items have been provided to the Bank previously
<P>

3)	Boonaldoon - Alone     (assets, costs 5%pa)
<P>

4)	Boonaldoon - Alone     (assets + costs + Inc 5%)
<P>

5)	Combined PAW/Boon.  (assets, costs 5%pa)
<P>

6)	Combined PAW/Boon.  (assets + costs +Inc 5%)
<P>

7)	<u>Combined PAW/Boon - worst case prolong drought scenario</u>
<P>

Items 3, 5, 7 are the items necessary to progress the application together with
initial twelve month cash flow.  Remaining items
4, 6 are not critical in our
assessment."
<P>

(Emphasis added)
<P>

197   	Of particular note in those requisitions are the items 2
and 7.  Without going into the details of the projections provided
in response
to those requisitions, I think it is sufficient to note the following summary
from the credit memorandum of Punch of
17 April 1990 as follows:
<P>

"Whilst it can be argued that in a prolonged drought situation property/stock
values would reduce, thereby reducing the Bank's security
ratios, it is
proposed to make continued provision of facilities subject to maintenance of
security/loan ratios of at least 130%
during the currency of facilities
provided by the Bank.  It should however be noted that PAW have provided 10
year projections based
on average carrying capacities of existing operations as
well as Boonaldoon (see comments elsewhere herein), and even in these
circumstances
interest serviceability is maintained and principal reductions
achieved resulting in full clearance of Group borrowings within an
eight year
period.
<P>

The Bank's involvement is therefore assessed as safe."
<P>

198   	Commenting on that statement, one may read into it some
elements of the bank's approach as it was conveyed to the Wrights,
namely:
<P>

a)	A prolonged drought could impact adversely on the group's property and
livestock values.
<P>

b)	A safety net for the bank against such a contingency lay in the maintenance
of a security to debt ratio acceptable to the bank.
<P>

c)	The bank was looking at no transient dry spell - its focus was on a
prolonged drought and its effects.
<P>

d)	The viability of the group's enlarged enterprise would remain sound over the
long term (ten years), based upon figures supplied
by the bank.
<P>

199   	Robertson was cross-examined on the worst case
projections presented by the Wrights in relation to the Boonaldoon acquisition
and he identified the worst case forecasts, both in relation to Boonaldoon
standing alone and Boonaldoon as part of the group's properties.
 In the latter
case that showed a total indebtedness at year end of 1990 of nearly $23,000,000
reducing to $1,664,082 in 1997 and
showing an extinguishment of debt in 1998
with a surplus of $2,940,443 increasing to one of $13,956,499 in the year 2000.
Robertson
agreed that it offered "a very attractive budget to a banker"
(T722.11).  
<P>

200   	This reflected some of the difficulty in the group's
case.  Favourable projections of this kind, even on a worst case basis,
were
common in the forecasts provided by the Wrights from time to time in support of
increased facilities up to 1991.  Expressions
of bank support for the group's
expansion should be viewed in the context of those favourable projections.  The
significance of that
support is to be found in the facilitation by the bank of
the enormous increase in indebtedness incurred by the group to a point
where
the attraction of the group account to another banker must have been
considerably dulled.  Of more significance, in my view,
was the fact that the
facilities which came to be provided in 1991 were facilities of an ongoing
nature:  a subject that is addressed
later in these reasons.
<P>

201   	As earlier noted, up to 1990 the group had adopted a tax
orientated policy towards expenditure, which was aimed at minimising
their tax
exposure at the same time as enhancing the value of their holdings through
expenditure on maintenance and improvement programs.
 As a result, it could not
be said that there was an abundance of cash in the system at any one time.  
<P>

202   	With the level of borrowings in contemplation, it must
have been readily apparent that a severe downturn in trading conditions
brought
about by market or unseasonal conditions, could soon confront the group with a
rapidly increasing shortage of working capital
and of funds to provide for
interest commitments.  Interest rates on overdraft at the commencement of 1990
were running at 21% and
fixed interest rates were in the vicinity of 16% and
over.  While the Wrights believed that they had structured their projections
on
a conservative basis, in my view, that could provide small comfort in a severe
and enduring drought.
<P>

203   	The Boonaldoon proposal involved an increased borrowing
of about $14,000,000, on a `walk in, walk out' basis.  The Wrights
intended to
augment the herd on Boonaldoon by developing a grazing crop to fatten nearly
10,000 head of steers over a 120 day period.
 In addition, it was anticipated
that it intended to increase the breeding herd by some 5,659 head at a cost of
$2,858,075 to be
offset in part by the sale of stock and equipment.  The bank
appraised the proposal at interest rates of 17.5% for overdraft and
16.5% for
loan funds.  
<P>

204   	In the credit memorandum of 17 April 1990, Punch paid
particular attention to the possibility of the effects of drought on
forecasts
provided by the Wrights.  Those comments were optimistic in tone.  It was noted
as follows:
<P>

"-	<u>DROUGHT</u>  In a drought year, Cotton Seed would be purchased as fodder
from nearby gin (15km) being an excellent feed ration and a very cheap
source
of protein.  In such a year, the forage oats would still be planted giving some
relief for the cows before it was necessary
to feed cotton.  Either action
should ensure cows conceive and therefore income would still be received from
the sale of offspring.

<P>

... 
<P>

Additional to that provided at CM 15/3/90, PAW have undertaken an assessment of
their possible performance given a prolonged drought
situation and based on
their peak carrying capacity through such a situation the total group also
evidences debt servicing/amortisation
capabilities <u>inclusive</u> of
Boonaldoon."
<P>

205   	The recommendation of the increased facility of
approximately $14,000,000 was based on the following factors:
<P>

"Increased facilities now sought are recommended given the following:
<P>

i)	Long and satisfactory banking relationship with the Wright Family for well
over 100 years.
<P>

ii)	Experience and reputation of our customers in the industry.
<P>

iii)	Projected group profitability subsequent to acquisition.
<P>

iv)	The Bank's involvement will continue to be subject to Annual Review to
ensure projections are achieved in line with forecasts
otherwise penalties in
the form of increased fees will apply.
<P>

v)	Boonaldoon would provide a fattening location for steers and heifers, weaned
from 20,000 breeders on existing properties, which
would otherwise have been
sold into the market or sent to a feedlot.
<P>

vi)	Seasonal variations over total property holdings would reduce the drought
risk on the total grazing operation.
<P>

vii)	Substantial opportunities to fatten large numbers of steers in good winter
seasons such as that which is now evident.
<P>

viii)	Close proximity to other group properties for ease in transfer of stock
but subject to varying seasonal influences.
<P>

ix)	Diversified source of income through possible ventures into sharefarming or
cotton cropping.
<P>

x)	Boonaldoon would contribute significantly to any proposed joint venture with
Cargill should the concept proceed.  (previously
covered in recent ARM)
<P>

xi)	Drawdown of facilities to be subject to formal request being provided to
the Bank with evidence of expenditure being provided
prior to formal approval
being conveyed to company.
<P>

xii)	Assessed safety of our involvement."
<P>

206   	The letter of offer from the bank was that of 18 April
1990.  It was for $14,000,000 on a commercial bill facility on terms,
as to the
first twelve months, on an interest only basis, with $4,000,000 being cleared
from the sale of the opportunistic purchase
of steers, the proceeds of which
were to come through by 15 November 1990.  The provision of all the facilities
was noted as subject
to the maintenance of a security/loan ratio of 130% based
on "current property/stock market values".  
<P>

207   	I think for the first time mortgage security over
Wallamumbi was required to support the bank's facility.  It was noted that
a
failure to clear the $4,000,000 bill facility for the purchase of steers by 15
November 1990 would attract a fee increase of 1%
per annum.  A similar penalty
applied to an earlier agreed upon amortisation program.  
<P>

208   	A follow-up facsimile from Armitage to David Wright of 19
April 1990 explained that the approval was limited to $14,000,000
due to
"discretionary restrictions with regard to total borrowing limitations for
Boonaldoon".  That involved a reduction in the
expected cost of the steer
purchases from in excess of $5,000,000 to a little over $4,130,000.  
<P>

209   	The overall review of facilities was the subject of the
further letter from the bank to Wright on 23 April 1990 which showed
a total
limit of $26,400,000 made up as follows:
<P>

"Facilities:	         Overdraft				$  1,000,000
<P>

Commercial Bill Acceptance/
<P>

Discount Line 1 Basic		$  5,000,000
<P>

Commercial Bill Acceptance/
<P>

Discount Line 2 Terminating
<P>

15/03/1991				$16,000,000
<P>

Commercial bill Acceptance/
<P>

Discount Line 3 Terminating
<P>

15/11/1990				$  4,000,000
<P>

Lease Finance			$     110,000
<P>

Indemnity Guarantee 			$<u>     290,000</u>
<P>

<u>					</u>$26,400,000"
<P>

210   	Of those facilities, the stated terms and conditions
included the following:
<P>

1.	The overdraft was described as basic.
<P>

2.	Commercial Bill line 1 was described as "Basic but subject to Annual Review
...".
<P>

3.	Commercial Bill line 2 was described as "terminating ... to be reviewed by
15th March 1991".
<P>

4.	Commercial bill line 3 was terminating facility "due for repayment by 15th
November, 1990 otherwise penalty rates will apply".
<P>

211   	The other facilities do not call for comment.  The
special conditions included the statement that:
<P>

"all facilities outstanding at Annual Review (scheduled for 15th March, 1991
and yearly thereafter) will be subject to a satisfactory
principal and interest
repayment arrangement being implemented.  <u>Such would of course be in terms
of cash flow projections current at that time however should a Principal and
Interest arrangement
not be implemented</u> to the satisfaction of the Bank all
line fees applicable at time of review will be <u>subject to penalty
increase</u> of 1.00% p.a."  (Emphasis added.)
<P>

212   	I regard that term as corroborative of the evidence of
the Wrights that repayment of borrowings and interest would be geared
to
cashflow as discussed on several occasions with the bank.  
<P>

213   	To round off the increase in facilities provided by the
bank in relation to the Boonaldoon and related livestock acquisition,
on 18 May
1990 the bank approved an increase of $1,000,000 to the commercial bill line 3.

<P>

214   	Wright and David Wright gave evidence of conversations
they had, mainly with Punch, during March, April and May of 1990 which
related
the proposed acquisition of Boonaldoon to the 1988 strategy and, on occasion,
to the ten year strategy.  
<P>

215   	The evidence of Punch in relation to those conversations
again reflected a comparatively poor recollection of those discussions
and for
the most part was dependent on diary notes.  An example of this is his evidence
in response to very detailed evidence by
Wright of an inspection of Boonaldoon
with Punch on 1 May 1990.  The evidence of Punch was limited to that which was
recorded in
his diary note of 3 May 1990 which was extremely brief and would
have provided little assistance as an aide memoire.  
<P>

216   	I have set out below a portion of the detailed
evidence-in-chief of Wright of the statements he made to Punch at this meeting
to illustrate my approach to the evidence of the Wrights and also to
demonstrate the way in which the Wrights showed a comparative
indifference to
the need to strictly adhere to the basis upon which facilities were provided by
the bank.  The passage follows:
<P>

"...  There are a number of issues  that I need to raise with you but in
particular you have raised the projected increase in cashflow
at a minimum in
1992 and I acknowledge that was the view reflected in the budget that was
presented to support the funding for Boonaldoon
when it was first produced.  As
we drive around you will see that the season has dramatically changed from
severe drought that I
reported to you earlier to potentially an excellent
season.  As a consequence we have reviewed our intentions regarding the
purchase
of 4,000 or 5,000 mature cows and replace them with steers to fatten
on these excellent pastures.  You will recall that we were initially
going to
increase the breeding herd level to 20,000 cows as covered by the 1988 strategy
to 25,000 cows under the enhanced programme
for the 1988 strategy after the
acquisition of Boonaldoon.  It is still our intention to now achieve a breeding
herd of 25,000 cows
consistent with that last budget but instead of purchasing
mature cows which would deliver a cashflow from the sale of their progeny
in
1992 we now plan to revert back to the original intent of building the herd
internally which will in turn mean that 1993 will
remain as the first year we
anticipate the escalated cashflow.
<P>

The next thing I want to advise you of is that we have been talking for some
time of dispersing our Hereford stud which was intended
to happen this year.
Because it is currently dry on the table lands, it seems sensible for us to
postpone the sale one more year
which will result in the sale proceeds for that
dispersal of something less than $500,000.00, being delayed for one year.  One
of
the benefits of delaying the sale will be that there will be a larger
offering through the growth in numbers of the herd between
now and then.  This
hopefully should return us a bigger gross simply by being a larger offering.
However, as you know the sale will
be of such a special nature that there can
be no certainty about what gross figure will be gained on the sale.
<P>

Additionally we have decided in line with the decision not to purchase more
breeding cows is our intention to retain our cast for
aged cows for one more
year.  This will result in a short fall of approximately $500,000.00 as
projected in the current budget for
this year, but will be reflected as a
similar return in next years budget, but we will in the mean time reap the
benefits of all
of their progeny.
<P>

You will notice also in the budget that there are approximately 900 to 1,000
steers which were scheduled for sale in the near future.
 We intend to place
them in feedlots and feed for 180 days for the Japanese market.  Our
calculations show that will generate a far
greater return per head.  However,
we will have to outlay a large sum maybe as much as $500,000.00 to feed them to
achieve that profit
potential.  This will be returned to us on the ultimate
sale of the cattle and there is no doubt in our mind it is a commercially
sound
strategy.
<P>

There are a number of minor alterations to that budget which will alter the
bottom line for this year but the principles remain
the same, in so far as they
relate to the 10 year strategy.  Perhaps the most significant of these changes
is our preference now
to hold the Boonaldoon sheep flock until next year as
opposed to selling them immediately.  This will also result in a delayed income
activity but on the positive side we will receive the proceeds of their wool
clip in October or November this year plus the sale
of their lambs probably
next March or April.  John, providing you approve in principle these budgetary
changes, we intend to detail
them in writing for the purpose of the record."
<P>

217   	With the level of borrowing approved, and having regard
to the importance of the ability of the bank to act upon the reliability
of
cashflow projections submitted by the Wrights in relation to the group's
acquisition of Boonaldoon and related livestock, I think
it is surprising that
such significant changes were put in place by Wright immediately after the
acquisition of Boonaldoon.  I accept
that topics of that nature were discussed
during the course of what must have been a lengthy inspection.  However, the
meeting was
not one set down for the purpose of announcing significant changes
in working capital requirements of the group. 
<P>

218   	According to Wright, the response of Punch to these
announcements was as follows:
<P>

"After seeing Boonaldoon I can understand the logic behind of (sic) all of the
proposals that you have spoken and can see that they
are commercially sensible.
The long term strategy that you have envisaged for the change in your
enterprise activity will certainly
be enhanced by the Boonaldoon acquisition.
It is a most impressive property and I can see how it will compliment in a
direct sense
all of your original thinking.  The bank endorses the changes that
you have made as they should consolidate your long term planning
which is now
well advanced.  Make sure that when you get home that you record all of these
changes, as they will impact on the budget,
so that I can place them on the
file." 
<P>

219   	I accept that in general discussion about the flexibility
in operations that Boonaldoon offered to the group, various decisions
by Wright
were revealed to Punch on this occasion.  I regard the meeting as falling into
the category of one keeping the bank informed
of current matters.
<P>

220   	I accept that, in general terms, Punch responded
enthusiastically to what was outlined to him by Wright.  However, that
enthusiasm
by Punch in relation to the group's major expansion does not, in my
view, translate in any fashion to the group's representation
case against the
bank.  Clearly, the major commercial operation which Boonaldoon represented was
treated on its own commercial merits
and as an adjunct to the group's then
existing enterprise.  All that should be said of those circumstances, and of
the terms upon
which the additional facilities were provided, is that the group
was entitled to expect the continuation of "terminating" facilities
on review
on acceptable commercial terms, provided that adequate security cover, in the
bank's opinion, was in place and the confidence
of the bank in the long term
commercial viability of the group remained.  
<P>

221   	As a matter of construction, I think the express terms of
the facility acknowledged the circumstances that the group's cashflow
would
govern the terms upon which principal and interest would be paid.  I have
occasion to address the significance of the provision
of "basic" facilities
later in these reasons.  The foregoing is intended to cover my views of the
series of communications between
the Wrights and the bank, during the first
half of 1990, relating to the Boonaldoon acquisition.
<P>

222   	The settlement of the Boonaldoon purchase, which took
place on 16 May, coincided with rapidly developing negotiations between
the
Wrights and Coles with the view to reaching agreement on a beef supply contract
to Coles.  Later in these reasons, the nature
and significance of the
commercial relationship between the Wrights and Coles is examined in some
detail.  I think it is sufficient
to note at this stage that the bank was being
kept abreast of Wright's dealings with Coles which included provision to the
bank of
a detailed proposal, as submitted by PAWS to Coles on 10 June 1990.

<P>

223   	Prior to that, Punch provided a banker's opinion of PAWS
by letter of 4 June 1990.  It was in highly favourable terms and
emphasised the
nature of the "long established and internationally recognised family pastoral
company" which owned and operated the
grazing properties of the Wrights, an
operation which it was noted was "reinforcing its position as a market leader
and major producer
in the beef cattle industry".  
<P>

224   	Of particular note, I think is the following:
<P>

"P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty. Limited, is seen to be trading profitably with
detailed financial projections provided and expertise
of principal/management
suggesting position will continue."
<P>

225   	Some measure of the commercial ambition of Wright and of
the extent of the bank's support of Wright in that context may be
extracted
from the approach by Wright for bank finance for the purchase of Nockatunga at
an estimated price of $10,600,000.  The
property was listed for auction on 8
August 1990.  
<P>

226   	At a meeting on 15 June, between Wright and Punch, Wright
brought up the subject of his interest in Nockatunga.  Punch's
diary note of
that meeting recorded the information provided to him by Wright in relation to
Nockatunga in the following terms:
<P>

"Preliminary cash flows have been provided together with a long term loan
schedule which incorporates 100% borrowing although stocking
of the property
would be initially from the stock purchase in conjunction with land, plant and
equipment.  Mr. Wright believes that
the property is drought proof and would
add considerable value to the P.A. Wright &amp; Sons operation in that the
company would
have 2 large breeding properties being Wallamumbi and the
property Nockatunga together with a fattening property at Boonaldoon.
<P>

Mr. Wright will provide all necessary information together with financials and
the Elders publication on the upcoming auction and
at this stage is seeking the
Bank's views as to whether or not to proceed for what would be a fairly lengthy
inspection of the property.
<P>

Indicated to David that the Bank would be looking at total debt to equity in
the overall operation and was not overly enthusiastic
about 100% finance given
that we have only just recently finalised the Boonaldoon purchase.
<P>

Undertook to examine cash flows and all necessary information that will be
provided in due course and if we can get comfortable
with the deal same will be
referred to our credit people with a view to indicating to Mr. Wright as to
whether or not the Bank is
prepared to proceed.  This will need to be done in
the short term as I would anticipate that Mr. Wright would be looking at
funding
from an alternative source should ANZ not be prepared follow the deal
through."
<P>

227   	At this meeting, Wright provided Punch with projections
which indicated that the property acquisition was "viable on a fully
financed
basis".  It was Wright's evidence that Punch received the proposal favourably
on the assumption that PAWS secured the Coles
contract.  It was Wright's
evidence that he submitted this proposal as a development of the group's ten
year plan.  This was denied
by Punch and, in my view, nothing turns on
resolving that conflict.  However, in keeping with my general approach to the
evidence
of Wright, I am satisfied that he presented the Nockatunga proposal in
the context of his overall plan to greatly increase the group's
breeding herd
and to effect a long term supply contract with Coles utilising the group's
boning room facilities.  
<P>

228   	I place no significance on the fact that Punch has no
recollection of any reference to a ten year plan.  According to Punch's
diary
note, he expressed some reservations about providing 100% finance.  It is
clear, however, that Punch was willing to examine
the proposal and I think it
is of interest that he recorded the need to examine the possibility of further
finance as a matter of
some urgency for the reason that he "would anticipate
that Mr Wright would be looking at funding from an alternative source should
ANZ not be prepared (to) follow the deal through".  
<P>

229   	There is no suggestion in Wright's evidence that he made
such a suggestion to Punch.  However, I think the record is of significance
in
reflecting the attitude of Punch as to the value of retaining the group
account.  I treat it more as a reflection of Punch's assessment
of Wright's
determination to pursue commercial objectives which involved a major expansion
of property and herd assets.  In any event,
the meeting did not deter the
Wrights from inspecting Nockatunga over a three day period in July 1990.
<P>

230   	The credit memorandum of Punch of 18 July 1990 I think is
a significant document.  It came at a time when Melrose had posted
a
significant loss for the year ended 30 June 1989 and was recorded as continuing
to trade at an operating loss.  Punch's credit
memorandum of 18 July was for
the purpose of seeking approval of increased facilities amounting to
$10,915,000 which, if approved,
would bring total borrowings to $38,315,000, in
addition to the group's liability under the unlimited guarantee given in
respect
to the Melrose debt then standing at $1,373,000.  The purpose of the
increased facility was to enable the Wrights to acquire Nockatunga.
 Punch
described the existing facility arrangements as either "basic subject to annual
review" or "as a terminating line however
<u>repayment terms to be subject to
annual review and then in terms of cash flow projections/requirements</u>.
Principal and Interest repayment schedule ... <u>to be implemented at Annual
Review </u>15/3/1991 and to be <u>in terms of cash flow projections ... which
must be acceptable to the Bank</u>."  The value of the account was noted as
being 32.74% per annum or 19.97% per annum on a basis of "before/after tax
return of (sic)
notional capital" (emphasis added).  
<P>

231   	The whole tenor of the memorandum, in my view, fully
corroborates the evidence of the Wrights of the strong support they
received
from the bank in their dealings up to 1991.  Under "<b><u>general
remarks</u></b>", Punch made the following observations:
<P>

"Since purchase of rural property "Boonaldoon" earlier this year the P.A.
Wright &amp; Sons operation has concentrated on maximising
the potential of the
property through development of on-farm management and taking advantage of the
earning capacity through short
term steer fattening.  In relation to the
acquisition of additional stock following purchase of property (CBA $5M) the
repayment
of this temporary facility by 15/11/90 from sale of trading steers
will present no difficulty to the Wrights and cashflows provided
at last
advices (CM 17/5/90) have been maintained and remain pertinent ... 
<P>

As part of PAW's continual assessment of its long term objectives and direction
which has, to some extent, been influenced by the
possible involvement of
Cargill Inc., some considerable progress has been made with Coles Limited in
relation to supply of both beef
and lamb through a centralised facility on a
contract or cost plus basis.  PAW believes it is able to achieve this more
efficiently
and cost effectively than the current procurement methods employed
by Coles who, in addition, would enjoy significant improvement
in the
uniformity, consistency and quality standards of their range of meat
products.
<P>

A proposal has been put to Coles on the basis that PAW are capable of "fast
tracking" supply of a large proportion of Coles Queensland's
volume
requirements from within their own herds and eliminate the costly profit taking
of the middleman.  Currently under consideration
by Coles Queensland, adoption
of the PAW concept would have a most positive effect on existing operations
with a guaranteed market
for beef produced.  (A decision is anticipated within
2 - 3 months)
<P>

In line with David Wright's ongoing strategy of gearing up for increased supply
of Australian beef into South East Asia and with
the possibility of the Coles
chain sourcing supply from the PAW operation, breeding capacity is continually
looked at in conjunction
with available acreage.  The acquisition of
"Boonaldoon" was based on this criteria and has proven to be a most worthwhile
purchase
even when considering the relatively short period of ownership.
Another suitable property has now come onto the market and presents
a rare
opportunity to secure an outstanding station."
<P>

232   	The description of Nockatunga that followed was glowing.
The projections provided by the Wrights had followed a format similar
to that
produced in relation to Boonaldoon, namely, by presenting a series of
alternatives which were intended to include a conservative,
worst case basis.
In line with earlier projections, those provided in relation to Nockatunga
showed a retirement of the facility
progressively over a ten year period and
the capacity of the Wrights to service interest from the cashflow projections.

<P>

233   	There is little doubt in my mind that Punch viewed the
group's financial prospects favourably and that this resulted from
his being
satisfied that Wright's eminence in the industry justified confidence in his
predictions and commercial judgment.  In describing
the highly advantageous
aspects of the acquisition, Punch made the following observations:
<P>

"(b)	The acquisition of Nockatunga would allow a doubling in size of the
current PAW breeding herd to approximately 50,000 breeders.
 This would
compliment existing livestock through the addition of a large, high quality
commercial herd of hereford cattle rarely
available in such numbers.
<P>

A breeding herd of this scale would enable PAW to be virtually self sufficient
as a supplier to premium outlets such as the Coles
Supermarket Chain or Cargill
(USA).
<P>

(c)	The Coles proposal referred to earlier, if enacted upon, would require
between 500 and 1,000 quality cattle per week.  The multiplying
factor of a
breeding herd of this size combined with yearling turnoff would enable PAW to
rapidly breed the quality of cattle required,
or alternatively to quickly
respond to changes in market requirements.
<P>

(d)	The addition of Nockatunga would add greatly to the diversity of different
climatic regions already enjoyed by the present operation.
 This would enable
PAW not only to take advantage of opportunity fattening of cattle (not budgeted
for) on large areas of naturally
irrigated pasture <u>but would also virtually
drought proof the current operation.</u>
<P>

...
<P>

(f)	The positioning of Boonaldoon Station between Nockatunga and the New
England properties as a major winter and opportunity summer
fattening operation
should enable PAW to be self sufficient in the grass finishing of livestock for
slaughter as seasons allow. 
The addition of the Nockatunga breeding herd to
the New England operation would significantly reduce the current requirement to
purchase
large numbers of weaners for fattening at Boonaldoon."
<P>

234   	As to safety of the proposed lending, Punch expressed the
opinion that the security to loan ratio was adequate at 162.4%
based on what
was thought to be the current market value.  He assessed the bank's exposure as
"safe".  Punch supported his recommendation
for approval of the increased
facility on the following bases:
<P>

"i)	Long and satisfactory banking relationship with the Wright Family for well
over 100 years.
<P>

ii)	        Experience and reputation of our customers in the industry.
<P>

iii)	       Projected group profitability subsequent to acquisition." 
<P>

235   	The financial projections referred to by Punch were
augmented by a further projection dated 24 July 1990 which showed a net
profit
after tax commencing in the year 1992 of approximately $700,000, increasing to
approximately $7,300,000 in the year 2000 on
an amalgamation basis of all New
England properties, Boonaldoon and Nockatunga.  The same projection showed a
retirement of the debt
by the year 1999.  Wright maintained his interest in
Nockatunga until 3 August 1990 when it was revealed that the property had been
sold prior to auction.
<P>

236   	While the events of mid 1990, in my view, demonstrate,
clearly, the strong support the Wrights received in their dealings
with the
bank, they also demonstrate the insignificance of the June meeting upon which
so much reliance has been placed by the Wrights
in these proceedings.  In all
of the financial submissions to the bank during 1990, including projections on
a `worst case' or conservative
basis, the acquisitions were shown as
financially attractive both on a stand alone basis and as an integral part of
the overall operations
of the group.  It is completely unrealistic, in my view,
to treat any understanding taken from the June meeting that the bank, in
appropriate circumstances, would capitalise interest on the group's borrowings
as having any application to the considerations surrounding
the group's
acquisition of Boonaldoon and its attempt to purchase Nockatunga.
<P>

237   	Agreement, in principle, was reached between Wright and
Coles in terms of Coles' letter to David Wright of 31 July 1990 which
contemplated an initial supply of approximately 500 cattle and 5,000 lambs per
week in a form described as "boned and boxed beef
and lamb".  The quantity was
described as one "required to test arrangements" for a year with the view to
holding a comprehensive
review after that time.  It appeared from that letter
that "equitable mechanisms for determining relevant prices and costs" were
unresolved at that stage.  
<P>

238   	The view I have formed is that failure of the group's
negotiations with Coles for a long term contract, together with the
devastating
effect of a severe drought, commencing at the end of 1991 and continuing, in
varying degrees through to 1995, were responsible
for the group's desperate
financial need from 1992 until the bank acted to put the group account into
default in February 1996. 
It follows that crucial to the group's case is the
extent to which the bank may be said to have contributed to the failure of the
group's dealings with Coles.  I have deferred a detailed consideration of the
cause of that commercial breakdown to a later section
of these reasons.
<P>

239   	An immediate consequence of the group's entry into the
Coles supply arrangement was the decision by Wright to retain for
that contract
the steers which had been the subject of the opportunistic purchase in mid 1990
in connection with the acquisition
of Boonaldoon.  Those steers were to be
fattened, sold and the proceeds used to repay the commercial bill line 3 of
$5,000,000 on
15 November 1990.
<P>

240   	On 1 August 1990, David Wright had a discussion with
Punch which was followed up by his letter to the bank of 2 August 1990.
 In
that letter, David Wright described the significance of the arrangement with
Coles in the following terms:
<P>

"Regarding our conversation yesterday on the impact of Coles Myer as an outlet
as it relates to the P.A. Wright &amp; Sons Pty.
Ltd. enterprise, coupled with
the acquisition of Nockatunga, we submit the following : 
<P>

The acceptance by Coles Myers Ltd of our proposal to supply Beef and Lamb on a
weekly basis, 52 weeks of the year, represents probably
one of the most
important events in the history of the P.A. Wright &amp; Sons livestock
enterprise.  It will represent the culmination
of the long term objectives
targeted by our company management over recent years with ANZ bank cooperation
in support of our expanding
enterprise. 
<P>

In general terms, this relationship with a national, high quality retail chain
will represent a guaranteed weekly outlet at predetermined
premium prices for
our total turnoff of offspring, within the year in which they are born.  This
marketing strategy will protect
us from the vagaries of the open market as well
as international currency movements.
<P>

Initial volumes as indicated by Coles are 500 cattle and 5000 lambs per week
with increases as mutually agreed per the letter of
intent.  (See attached).
At this level of throughput of steers, we would require a breeding cow herd of
approximately 50,000 females
to be able to satisfy these requirements from
within our own resources, being the targeted herd size after the acquisition of
Nockatunga.
<P>

Conservatively assuming a net $20 processing profit after costs and interest,
this will represent a weekly profit for beef alone
of $10,000 per week.
Further, P.A. Wright &amp; Sons produced livestock will have a market outlet
into the system at prices which
reflect a premium of approximately 5 to 10
cents per kilogram liveweight, over and above the going market values of the
day, regardless
of drought forced sales etc." 
<P>

241   	The letter concluded with the following observation
concerning the acquisition of Nockatunga:
<P>

"The successful acquisition of Nockatunga would enable our operation to be
virtually self sufficient in the supply of cattle for
Coles requirements.  It
will add to our strength in the international market in the supply of quality
manufacturing beef and will
allow us to select superior genetics and compound
them rapidly across an extremely large genetic base of cattle."
<P>

242   	David Wright had been deeply involved in the earlier
submission of the Nockatunga proposal to the bank.  He had taken part
in the
property inspection between 22 and 25 June 1990 and this had been followed by a
meeting with Punch on 11 July 1990. 
<P>

243   	David Wright's evidence of his telephone conversation
with Punch of 1 August 1990 was quite detailed.  He informed Punch
of the
successful outcome of the Coles negotiations which he linked to the strategy
outlined at the June meeting.  He foreshadowed
the need for additional working
capital to fund the Coles cattle pipeline.  That would entail significant
feedlot costs which he
said had not been quantified so as to enable him to put
a figure on the group's working capital requirements.  He expected it would
be
several months before those figures were known.  David Wright also announced
that the $5,000,000 facility would not be retired
in November as had been
agreed as the steers for which that facility had been raised would be retained
to supply boxed beef to Coles.
<P>

244   	According to David Wright, Punch assured him that
additional working capital required to satisfy the Coles supply arrangement
would be made available by the bank, given the adequate security held by the
bank.  It was his evidence that Punch also agreed to
the retention of the
steers on Boonaldoon for use in the Coles pipeline.  He said that Punch had
informed him that there would "be
no problem with the non-repayment of funds in
November".  Punch, he said, anticipated the bill facility would be rolled over
into
a basic facility repayable in line with cashflow.  
<P>

245   	Punch denied that he gave the Wrights any assurances as
to the provision of working capital or relieved the Wrights of providing
financials in accordance with the terms of the bank's facilities.  However, I
accept the substance of David Wright's evidence.  
<P>

246   	At the same time, I am satisfied that Punch did not give
the group carte blanche in respect of working capital requirements,
then, or at
any other time.  As in the case of most of the evidence, I think the conflict
in evidence lies more in the sphere of
emphasis.  I do not regard the evidence
of David Wright as amounting to an assertion that the Wrights were given an
open cheque to
perform the Coles contract, nor that they were excused from
providing appropriate financial statements generally or in the long term.
 I am
satisfied that it was understood by Punch that in the immediate term the
Wrights would have difficulties in adapting their
financials to meet the cost
impact of the Coles supply arrangement.  I am also satisfied that it was
recognised by Punch that adjustments
to working capital requirements would have
to be addressed and that neither the Wrights, nor Punch anticipated that that
would create
any significant problem.
<P>

247   	Much of this was, I think, confirmed in the diary note of
Punch of 23 August 1990 at which time there was an "excess position
on working
accounts" of the group of approximately $230,000, partly due to the effect of
preparing for the Coles supply contract.
 That diary note also recognised the
impact of the Coles contract upon working capital requirements as follows:
<P>

"With the obvious requirement for retention of stock to enable the Coles supply
to commence mid September the proposed reduction
in debt of $5M due 15/11/90
will need to be reassessed.  Credit Memorandum of 17/5/90 which approved
additional facilities of $15.905M
to enable acquisition of Boonaldoon and stock
incorporated $5M reduction and implementation of a P &amp; I repayment schedule
at
A/R 15/3/91 in line with cash flow projections acceptable to the Bank.
<P>

In view of existing excess and what will certainly be a change to original
approval terms I have requested as a matter of priority,
provision of cash flow
to incorporate any further increased requirements and the impact of supply of
meat to Coles.
<P>

This will enable a formal submission to be put forward prior to 15/11/90 when
the original $5M reduction was schedules (sic)."
<P>

248   	The evidence also is a strong indication, in my view, of
the absence of understanding by the group of the precise costings
and returns
to the group related to the Coles contract.  The bank's willingness to support
the group's expansion activities was further
emphasised by the provision of
funds by the bank to enable the Wrights to acquire Thorpleigh in September 1990
and in the approval
of lease facilities of approximately $180,000.  Thorpleigh
was purchased for $1,200,000 with settlement taking place on 21 November
1990.

<P>

249   	The diary note of 13 September 1990, signed off by Punch,
envisaged an "increase in facilities of up to $2.0m."  The same
note recorded
that Punch anticipated receipt of detailed cashflows showing the change in
requirements which it was acknowledged "should
also substantiate deferment of
the repayment of $5m line due November 1990 from the sale of fattened steers"
on the basis that they
were "now required as part of the Coles transaction and
(would) not be sold in the short term". 
<P>

250   	The willingness of the bank to accommodate the
vicissitudes in the group's working capital requirements was further emphasised
by the bank's records for October 1990 in which the overdraft account was in an
excess position of approximately $1,800,000:  this
at a time when cashflow
statements provided by the Wrights to the bank showed an operating deficit for
the quarter to 30 September
1990 of approximately $830,000.  The position was
not much different in November with the cashflow statements to 31 October
showing
an operating deficit of $1,155,593 at a time when the overdraft was in
an excess position in early November of approximately $1,500,000.
 Punch's
diary note of 8 November 1990 recorded that excess position and, presumably
within his discretion, approved a temporary
increase in the overdraft limit to
$3,000,000 noting that "facilities (would) increase to $29.4M ...".
<P>

251   	There was an important meeting of the Wrights and the
bank at Wallamumbi on 14 November 1990.  The Wrights have given detailed
evidence of this meeting.  There is a lengthy diary note of that date which has
been signed off by Punch and Vaughan.  
<P>

252   	The meeting was attended by Wright, Phillip and David
Wright, Hudson, Nicholls and Robertson, with Buckley, Punch and Vaughan
representing the bank.  The evidence of Nicholls, Robertson and Hudson was
scant compared with the detailed evidence of Wright and
David Wright concerning
the meeting.  The recollection of the bank's representatives, I think, was very
much confined to the record
of the diary note of the meeting.  
<P>

253   	The main bone of contention between the witnesses lies in
the emphasis placed by the Wrights upon the linking up of those
most recent
activities of the group with its "1988 strategy" and "10 year plan".  The
bank's representatives denied that there were
references to any such strategy
or plan.  In my view, nothing turns on that conflict.
<P>

254   	Each of Wright and David Wright gave extensive and
detailed evidence of the discussion that took place at this meeting. 
I think
it came down to this:  the Wrights anticipated considerable benefits from the
Coles contract which enabled the group "to
take a profit margin at whatever
point in the supply pipeline (of beef) where profit becomes available":  the
Wrights envisaged becoming
the sole meat supplier to Coles "for all the species
handled over their meat counter":  while breeding herd numbers had risen
substantially
there would still be a shortfall in supplying Coles from the
group's herd:  this deficiency could be "satisfied with the acquisition
of
properties similar to Nockatunga ... including the other half of Kindon":  it
was confirmed that bill line 3 "had been rolled
over into working capital ...
for the Coles supply":  it was impossible at that stage to state realistically
what the group's requirements
for working capital would be:  the developments
of 1990 were recognised by the bank as the implementation of the group's 1988
strategy:
 dealing with the Melrose debt was deferred until a decision was made
in relation to the disposal of that business:  an increase
in working capital
of $2,000,000 was required:  there would be some delay in providing financials
which accurately reflected the
requirements of the Coles contract.  
<P>

255   	According to David Wright this information was met with
the following response of Punch:
<P>

"We have discussed the working capital requirements for Coles on previous
occasions.  The Bank is very comfortable with the contract
which you have with
Coles, and if that means the provision of additional working capital in order
to effectively operate that arrangement
then the Bank will support you in that
regard on the basis of the 130% loan security limit.  If additional funds are
required for
steer trading, property purchases or to complete the buildup in
the breeding herd let us know.  In the meantime I will process an
application
for additional funds and send you up a new facility letter."
<P>

256   	I accept the substance of the Wrights' evidence, although
I doubt the accuracy of their recollection of the emphasis placed
upon the 1988
strategy or 10 year plan of the group.  As to the statement attributed to
Punch, I accept that the Wrights received
some comfort from that statement in
terms of continued bank support for the group in the sorting out of
requirements for the Coles
contract and that some reference in that context may
have been made to the adequacy of security cover held by the bank.  I think
it
is clear from the evidence that the Wrights were left with the expectation that
the additional working capital requirements of
$2,000,000 would be approved by
the bank.  I am satisfied that it was not intended at that stage that the
Melrose debt would be taken
into consideration in relation to that additional
borrowing.
<P>

257   	I do not regard the meeting as absolving the group from
providing satisfactory financials to the bank to enable it to maintain
an
appropriate supervision of the account.  At the same time I think it was
recognised by the bank that the considerable change in
the group's operations
would occasion accounting problems to the group, particularly due to the
imprecise state of the group's costing
of the Coles requirements at the time of
this November meeting.
<P>

258   	During the course of the hearing, I noted the conduct of
witnesses at the time they were giving evidence and I have no cause
to doubt
the veracity of any of them on the basis of their presentation in the witness
box.  In the case of one or more of the experts,
there was clearly, I thought,
some degree of bias, but with the bank's witnesses and the group's witnesses, I
have no occasion to
doubt their veracity and any conflict of evidence I have
put down to the different emphases placed by witnesses on oral communications
from time to time; to a failure of recollection and to a breakdown in precise
communication.  That is not to say that there was not,
in one or two instances
in relation to the bank officers, an impression given of defensiveness that may
have further impaired an
already impaired recollection of the details of events
long past.  In the case of the Wrights, I think their evidence of discussions
in such detail challenged their actual capacity to recall events.
<P>

259   	The bank's diary note of the meeting is a detailed record
which recounted Wright's views about the rural economy and his
optimism about
the beef industry in the context of the Coles supply arrangement.  The group's
cattle numbers were said to be about
40,000 head, which involved a purchase of
some 16,000 cattle during the year to supplement the group's supply of meat to
Coles. 
It was noted, without comment, as follows:
<P>

"(Wright) hopes that within 3 years he will be able to supply 66% of Coles
requirement inhouse.   To do this he is on the look out
for acquisition of
suitable land i.e. property adjacent to Paradise."
<P>

260   	The diarist noted Wright's continued interest in a joint
venture with Cargill and that Wright envisaged, if that negotiation
was not
successful, that the aim "would be to develop export markets in the US, Japan
and/or Korea".  The note confirmed discussion
concerning Melrose and that it
was "agreed that the current funding arrangements (would) formally be
transferred to SMBB Punch's
control".  The Melrose debt was approximately
$1,100,000.  With that transfer the bank was to take over from the Queensland
branch
direct control of the Esrolem account. 
<P>

261   	It was recognised that the commercial bill line 3 for
$5,000,000 due to clear that month would "require extension as the
Coles
venture (required) that cattle numbers be increased not sold off".  It was also
acknowledged that cashflows and budget projections
provided by the Wrights
indicated an additional $2,000,000 of funding was required.  Of the additional
funding that was required,
it was noted that as the "budgets had only recently
been prepared ... it was unclear as to where the additional funding need was
to
be allocated".  Nicholls was to provide those details.
<P>

262   	In the light of confusion over the provision of
facilities that I think existed in early 1991, I think the evidence of the
Wrights and the record of this meeting make it clear that the transfer of the
indebtedness of the Melrose account to PAWS was not
taken into account by
either party in calculating the required $2,000,000 of additional funding.  
<P>

263   	I think some measure of Wright's appetite for borrowing
may be taken from his interest in a development proposal at Lane
Cove which
Wright brought to the attention of the bank in December 1990.  Vaughan's diary
note of 20 December 1990 of a meeting with
Wright is not without interest in
relation to this subject as he noted that Wright required 100% financing of the
proposal.  Vaughan
recorded Wright as informing him that if "the Bank was
unable to support him then he (had) alternative arrangements already in place".

<P>

264   	It was also recorded in the diary note of 20 December
1990 that Wright had conveyed to Vaughan that the Lane Cove venture
was "the
fore runner of a number of similar arrangements and (that) was one reason why
he was keen for the ANZ to be involved". 
It is difficult to understand the
thinking of Wright in looking for increased borrowings at this time and, in my
view, it is consistent
only with the observation made earlier in these reasons
that Wright was bent on borrowing to the extent possible against the extensive
holdings of the group which he regarded as underutilised capital.  
<P>

265   	I think the beginning of the confusion which surrounded
the provision of a further $2,000,000 facility is to be found in
the diary note
of 6 December 1990 which commented on cashflow statements, provided by the
Wrights, to 30 November 1990 which showed
an operating deficit of $558,367.
The diary note concluded with the following:
<P>

"Budget has still not been prepared to allow comparison.  We have, however,
been presented with detailed cashflow including Coles
and Boonaldoon in which
company requests a further $2M to assist with the purchase of Thorpleigh and
transfer of Melrose debt to
PA Wright &amp; Sons."
<P>

266   	At that stage, as far as the evidence goes, Nicholls had
not provided the bank with details of where "the additional funding
needed was
to be allocated". 
<P>

267   	On the bank's file is a limit adjustment worksheet record
dated 20 December 1990 which noted approval of an increased overdraft
of
$1,000,000 to $3,000,000.  It was noted that "Full CM currently being
prepared".  It referred back to Punch's diary note of 8
November 1990 which
recorded the excess in the overdraft position mentioned previously in these
reasons.  It will be remembered that
that diary note was made at a time when
the bank was awaiting cashflows to accommodate the Coles supply requirements
and contained
the following note that in "the interim and to cover existing
excess, temporary limit is to be recorded to a level of $3M ... pending
exact
requirements being ascertained".  The expiry date was noted as being 15
December 1990.  I think it is quite clear that the
additional accommodation of
$2,000,000 was approved within the discretion of Punch and on 20 December 1990
was confirmed, as I read
the record, with the review date of 15 March 1991
along with the other facilities.  
<P>

268   	When Punch came into the picture in relation to the Lane
Cove development, I think it is fair to say that he was not unfavourable
to it,
an attitude which was not entirely shared by the other bank officers associated
with the matter.  I think this much is justified
by his letter to Wright of 28
December 1990, which, however, concluded with the caution that the "letter
(was) not an approval but
merely a starting point for further discussion".  
<P>

269   	The approval of the increase of the overdraft facility by
$2,000,000 raised at the meeting of 14 November 1990 was formally
notified to
the Wrights by the bank's letter to Wright of 2 January 1991 earlier reproduced
in these reasons.  A covering letter,
however, referred to the 14 November 1990
meeting and expressed pleasure in confirming "approval of an increase in lines
of $2,000,000
to assist with the Thorpleigh property purchase and transfer of
debt from Melrose Meats Pty. Limited to PA Wright &amp; Sons Pty.
Limited".
The way in which the then existing facilities were described placed the
additional accommodation in the commercial bill
line 2, which was previously
noted as $16,000,000.  However, a note accompanying the description of that
bill line shown as having
a limit of $19,150,000, is repeated below for the
ease of reference: 
<P>

"Currently drawn to an amount of $17 million which incorporates stock
(including Boonaldoon) and previous property purchases.  Increased
limit
reflects $2.15 million increase in funding for the transfer of Melrose
overdraft ($350,000) and commercial bill line ($800,000)
from ANZ Brisbane and
purchase of Thorpleigh ($1M).  Due to a bookkeeping error Line 2 was previously
advised as $16 million whereas
correct figure was $17 million and at the same
time Line 3 was previously advised as $5 million whereas correct amount was $4
million.
<P>

Facility was regarded as a terminating line but following recent discussions is
now a basic facility subject to Annual Review next
due 15th March, 1991."
<P>

270   	In the light of the history of the facilities traced
earlier in these reason, I have difficulty in identifying any "bookkeeping
error".  However, I am reasonably satisfied that confusion reigned within the
bank in identifying the transfer of the Melrose overdraft
and bill line as
being related to the additional funding of $2,000,000 notified by the Wrights
at the 14 November 1990 meeting. 
<P>

271   	There was also included in the terms of approval a
requirement of a minimum security cover of 130% on the basis of valuation
of
properties on "current market valuation and in line with the Bank's assessed
`Fair Market Value'", while the value of stock would
be discounted down to 60%
of market value.  However, it was noted as follows:
<P>

"Additional facilities provided have resulted in this requirement no longer
being met.  At current lending level security cover
needs to equate to $39.8M
which equates to a shortfall of some $3.9M
<P>

I am confident that this situation can be resolved quickly on (sic) these
figures do not include Thorpleigh or Kindon which should
add a further $3.3M
cover."
<P>

272   	I have been unable to reconcile that statement with a
reference in Punch's credit memorandum of 14 January 1991 which dealt
with a
proposed increase in borrowings of $3,233,000 which he observed would "see a
total security/loan ratio of 164.25 based on
total CMV (Current Market Value)
of $50.284M ...".  However, nothing turns on that in light of the findings made
in these reasons.
<P>

273   	As earlier noted, of particular significance in that
review of facilities, in my view, was the provision of all major facilities
as
basic facilities which involved converting terminating facilities to basic.
The sole reason in the bank so acting arose out of
the bank's recognition and
acceptance of the importance of the Coles supply contract to the long term
viability of the group.  That
the bank was prepared to convert non-basic, major
facilities to basic facilities in the circumstances that arose post July 1990
is
of central significance, in my view, in the proper understanding of the
bank's obligations to the group in respect of those facilities.

<P>

274   	In my view, the bank should not bear any responsibility
to the group on the group's representation case in respect of its
dealings with
Coles.  Those dealings were pursued by the group as part of Wright's vision of
controlling the supply of beef from
breeding, through processing, to delivery
of processed beef to major retail outlets and of assuming a dominant role for
the group
in eastern Australia.  For the reasons I have given, I consider it
quite unrealistic to attribute the group's embarkation into that
venture to any
reliance upon any support of the bank other than in accordance with the terms
of the facilities provided by the bank
for that purpose; leaving open the
question of reasonableness in the bank's enforcement of those terms.  In my
view, the statements
of the bank at the June meeting should not be treated as a
foundation for that commercial decision of the group and no basis for
the
group's representation case can be reasonably extracted from the evidence of
the communications between the parties during 1990.
 In brief, the group's
representation case, in my view, is unfounded.
<P>

275   	That leaves the "contract" case which the group seeks to
raise by way of amendment. One of the more serious implications
of granting the
application lies in the need to re-open the hearing to receive evidence of
damages, in the event of the group being
successful in contract.  
<P>

276   	A matter of equal concern is the manner in which the
group has particularised the contract and breaches of contract in the
proposed
amendment.  The contracts are simply identified as "each of the contracts
(including the security documents) relied upon
by the Plaintiff (bank) in these
proceedings".  The proposed amendment does not identify the powers of the bank
which it is alleged
were unreasonably exercised in breach of the implied term
of reasonableness.  The "conduct" of the bank relied upon is particularised
as
"the conduct referred to in paragraph A of the written submission under the
heading "Summary of Conduct of Bank (including representations)
relied upon by
PAWS"."  That happened to embrace, at least (as the description is not free
from ambiguity) twenty-three pages of
narrative submissions commencing with the
"long association" between the parties over a period of one hundred and fifty
years, the
relationship between them in the "early 1970s" and the "early 1980s"
followed by a description of events from 24 October 1986 to
19 July 1991.  The
only saving grace about particulars of liability provided in the proposed
amendment was their confinement to the
evidence that had been adduced in the
proceedings.
<P>

277   	In the ordinary course, before embarking upon a
consideration of the amendment, I would have required a more conventional
and
unambiguous formulation of the group's proposed contract case before
determining the application and, that achieved, examined
the bank's objections
based upon prejudice to it occasioned by the granting of any such amendment.
<P>

278   	The approach I have decided to take is to examine the
conduct of the bank in 1991 and following years in terms of its reasonableness
in the context of:
<P>

(a)	the powers, rights and obligations of the bank under the express terms of
its facilities, properly construed; and
<P>

(b)	the unique circumstances of the subject banker/customer relationship which
had survived for a period of some one hundred and
fifty years.  
<P>

279   	That done, I propose to revisit the application to
determine whether justice demands that some amendment should be granted
and the
group allowed to quantify a case of expectation loss.
<P>

280   	I have chosen that course for the following reasons:
<P>

(a)	No court, in my view, should be insensitive to the financial and social
consequences to the Wrights should they fail in these
proceedings to the point
where, I think, the Court should be quite certain when judgment is delivered in
the matter that all reasonable
avenues of relief open to the Wrights have been
fully examined, consistent with extending fairness to the bank.
<P>

(b)	Limiting the consideration of a "contract" case in the manner outlined in
the preceding paragraph will not trespass onto ground
which has not been
vigorously turned over by the parties in the group's equitable estoppel
case.
<P>

(c)	In the event that the conclusion is reached that there were grounds upon
which relief of some kind should be extended to the
group, no prejudice to the
bank, in my view, could arise that could not be cured by:
<P>

(i)	providing the bank with the opportunity to be further heard on the question
of the amendment and any liability it may have under
any such amendment before
making final determinations as to liability;
<P>

(ii)	providing the parties the opportunity to adduce further evidence to enable
the completion of a hearing on quantum;
<P>

(iii)	an appropriate order for costs.
<P>

281   	The proper construction of the express terms of the 2
January 1991 facility letter, in my view, is the starting point in
examining
the bank's subsequent conduct, as it represented the agreement reached with
PAWS in relation to the additional facilities
provided by the bank in 1990, as
varied to accommodate the requirements of the group under its additional
commercial commitment to
the Coles contract.  In order to understand the
importance of the conversion of all major terminating lines to basic so as to
provide
basic facility terms for all major borrowings by the group, it is
necessary to turn to the parties, understanding of that term.
<P>

282   	The evidence of Wright was that basic facilities had no
specific repayment date or dates:  they were ongoing and repayment
had been
dependent upon the group's cashflow.  There had been no occasion prior to 1991
in which the bank had required a reduction
in a basic facility in other
circumstances.  They were long term facilities with any review provisions being
related to interest
rates, and fee charges.  Punch, Buckley and Meers gave
evidence of the banking meaning of the term.  The evidence of Punch was as
follows:
<P>

"Q.   In relation to that, you had indicated in the letter to Mr Wright or to
the Wrights on 2 January 1991 that the $5 million
referred to in this
memorandum had in fact been switched over from terminating to basic, subject to
annual review on 15 March 1991.
 That is right, isn't it?
<P>

A.   That is correct.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   And you recall the exchange between yourself and his Honour earlier today
that basically meant in the normal course of events
from past experience and
the like to the Wrights, as you understand it, would have anticipated that
facility to continue beyond 15
March 1991?
<P>

A.   It was approved until 15 March 1991.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  It wasn't approved to that date, there it was approved so that there would
be a review on 15 March 1991?
<P>

A.   On 15 March 1991.
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   That is not even correct.  It was for an annual review on that
date, which I certainly draw some significance from."
<P>

(T952.13-18 ... T952.35-50.)
<P>

283   	In re-examination he offered the further description:
<P>

"Q.  Earlier today, Mr Punch, you agreed that there was a distinction in your
mind between a facility which is basic terminated
15 March and basic subject to
annual review 15 March.  What was the difference to your mind?
<P>

A.  If it is basic subject to annual review it is reviewed, to be undertaken at
the date that the facility becomes reviewable, in
which case it would be 15
March.  If it is terminated, it is 15 March.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  So basic terminated 15 March?
<P>

A.  If there is an indication of terminating it would be normal to be
repaid.
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  I don't know if there is an issue about this.  Loans described
as basic, it is my understanding that those loans
are ongoing, subject to
annual reviews?
<P>

A.  If they are ongoing, yes, but to the extent that they are reviewable on
that date, and the reason for that is obviously things
that can happen within a
12 month period.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  Right, but in the ordinary course of events those loans are ongoing?
<P>

A.  In the normal course of events, yes.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  In fact I think if you look at your in tab 193, that is I think your credit
memorandum, the last page, you use that terminology
distinguishing terminating
facilities with funding required on an ongoing basis?
<P>

A.  That is right.
<P>

 
<P>

THOMSON:  Q.  In that context, as you understand it, how long is the ongoing
basis, or is that also subject to review?
<P>

A.  Well, I think the date 15 March was the date that was put in place to
enable the review of the position to be undertaken in
the light of what was
going to happen.
<P>

(T987.46-988.26.)
<P>

284   	The reference to "tab 193" was one to a credit memorandum
of Punch of 7 February 1991 which has an added significance referred
to later
in these reasons.  The purpose of the memorandum was to obtain approval of an
increase in limits, inter alia, "to ... transfer
terminating facilities to
revolving".  As already noted in these reasons, the major terminating
facilities had already been converted
to basic in the bank's letter to the
group of 2 January 1991.  However, the passage in the memorandum to which I
drew Punch's attention
was the following:
<P>

"All facilities are regarded as basic ... These lines were previously as
terminating facilities.  However due to changed circumstances
... funding is
required on an ongoing basis ... Loan Approval Fee:  $15,000."
<P>

285   	It appears to have been Buckley's understanding of the
position:
<P>

"Q.  Do you see, "All facilities are regarded as basic subject  to annual
review" - that is as you understood the position?
<P>

A.  That is what it says."
<P>

(T1147.58-1148.3)
<P>

286   	I think it is significant that Buckley had been made
familiar with the terms and the nature of the facilities provided by
the bank
in its facility letter of 2 January 1991 and approved of those facilities and
those terms.  
<P>

287   	Meers gave similar evidence as follows:
<P>

"Q.  I just want to ask you some questions about facilities first of all - you
describe there facility terms and payment arrangements.
 Now, the overdraft and
the bill facility are both described as basic subject to annual review?
<P>

A.  Um-hm.
<P>

Q.  What was your understanding as to what that term meant, in terms of the
bank's terms of payment or terms of the money advanced?
<P>

A.  At that time as what it does now within a basic range the facility could
move within the limit throughout the course of  the
year but it was subject to
an annual review at the 12 month time frame.
<P>

Q.  It is essentially a revolving facility, is that right?
<P>

A.  That is correct.
<P>

Q.  Other things being equal the customer would expect it to be rolled over at
the annual review?
<P>

A.  It was a question was it, the answer is, provided financial arrangements
were in order.
<P>

Q.  It is possible is it not for the bank to have an arrangement that is
basically subject to annual review and for it also to be
a condition that
repayments with rural borrowers would be made out of cash flow from time to
time as the cash flow allowed?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.  If you would look at the bottom of page 17 of your statement and over to
the top of page 18, you see here dealing with the notion
of basic subject to
annual review?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  You remember at the very beginning of my questions to you I asked you
whether, all other things being equal, a basic facility
would continue to
revolve or be extended to the point after each annual review?
<P>

A.  Yes, I do.
<P>

Q.  And you agreed with me that it would?
<P>

A.  Yes; subject, as I think I said at that time, to a financial ability of the
customer to satisfy a lender, such as a bank, to
maintain the obligations for
the coming 12 months.
<P>

Q.  I want to explore very concerning the tension of briefly those two
concepts.  At the top of page 18, you talk about the bank
having a complete
discretion as to whether or not those facilities would be continued?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  And, if so, in what amount and on what terms and conditions and if the bank
made a decision not to continue with those facilities
they could be called up
and demanded for repayment?
<P>

A.  I don't know about the tension.  What that infers, there were covenants -
normally banks put covenants in the facilities and
if there is a breach during
the 12 months of that covenant, its creates an ability for the bank to demand
repayment in part or full.
<P>

Q.  Unless those breaches are waived?
<P>

A.  Waived, that's correct.
<P>

Q.  That is not an infrequent occurrence, is it?
<P>

A.  To be cured, no."
<P>

(T1228.51-1229.20 ... 1241.22 - 1242.1)
<P>

288   	The evidence of Meers in his statement of
evidence-in-chief, which was admitted without objection, was to the effect that
"in accordance with the practice and procedures ... in place within the Bank
(and subject to default), these facilities would be
provided, until the
occurrence of the next annual review, after which the Bank's decision to
maintain them would be reconsidered."
 Meers added a further piece of evidence
which I regard as irrelevant, namely:
<P>

"I also intended to convey the Bank's intention that following the occurrence
of such `<i>annual review</i>', the Bank would have a complete discretion as to
whether or not those facilities would be continued and, if so, in what amount
and
on what terms and conditions and that if the Bank made a decision not to
continue those facilities, they could be called up and demanded
for repayment
following the occurrence of that `<i>annual review</i>'."
<P>

289   	To the extent that the last quoted passage purported to
construe the meaning of the phrase, I would reject it as a plainly
wrong
construction. 
<P>

290   	Clearly, as understood by the parties, in the
circumstances in which the 2 January 1991 facilities were provided, "(a)ll
facilities (were) regarded as basic" as "funding (was) required on an ongoing
basis".  Further, I think that is the plain meaning
of the terms `basic subject
to annual review' when viewed in the context of the surrounding circumstances
referred to in that letter
which led to the conversion of all major facilities
to basic.  I think that that is how the bank regarded its terms.
<P>

291   	In the context of the relationship which had existed
between PAWS and the bank, the clear intention of the bank was to provide
an
ongoing facility: 
<P>

(a)	during the continuity of the purpose for which it was provided;
<P>

(b)	subject to:
<P>

(i)	there remaining, in the bank's opinion, adequate security cover for its
loan;
<P>

(ii)	the bank's continued confidence in the long term viability of the group's
underlying enterprise;
<P>

(iii)	the group's capacity to maintain, in the long term, interest repayments
as agreed upon from time to time; 
<P>

(iv)	        the default conditions of the loan; and
<P>

(v)	        the commercial capacity of the bank to continue its facilities in
place;
<P>

292   	Clearly, in those circumstances, the default conditions
could not be exercised capriciously.  It is in that context that
I consider the
bank's conduct should be viewed post 2 January 1991.
<P>

293   	The justification for the conversion of the principal
facilities to "basic subject to annual review" was described by Punch
in the
credit memorandum of 14 January 1991 as "due to changed circumstances whereby
the Group has secured a contract to supply all
Coles supermarket stores in NSW
and Qld with chilled beef cuts funding is required on an ongoing basis". 
<P>

294   	In referring to the November visit to Wallamumbi, Punch
recorded that at that time "the Group's overdraft liability increased
substantially to accommodate increased cattle purchases occasioned by the Coles
deal and payment of $122,000 Thorpleigh deposit".
 He went on to record that
the "excess was covered in the interim period by a temporary limit to a level
of $3M (i.e. Basic $1M/Temp
$2M) pending exact requirements being ascertained".
That is how the Wrights saw it.  
<P>

295   	As earlier noted, I think there was a degree of confusion
within the bank, as reflected in this memorandum, which confused
the
requirements of the group in relation to the Coles supply arrangement with the
"formal" transfer of the Melrose debt from Queensland.
<P>

296   	The events of the first quarter of 1991 bear close
examination, for it is a period in which the strongest evidence emerged
of a
materially different approach by the bank in the treatment of the group
account.  The credit memorandum of 14 January 1991 appears
to be a belated
submission by Punch in relation to the major changes which were reflected in
the terms of the group's facilities
in the 2 January 1991 letter.  It is noted
in the credit memorandum as follows:
<P>

"Delay in formal advices is regretted, however, information sought from
customer as to exact amount and allocation of increased
funds has only recently
been received."
<P>

297   	I have some difficulty in accepting the accuracy of that
statement.  Punch's credit memorandum of 14 January 1991 ran into
something of
a wasp's nest in the form of the reaction to it of the credit sector of the
bank.  
<P>

298   	During the period that Punch had the responsibility in
the business banking sector for the group's account, the structure
of reporting
involved the following:  Punch was one of five senior managers reporting to the
regional executive of business banking
who, from the end of 1990, was Buckley.
At the same time, lending decisions were subject to review, where lending
exceeded the senior
manager's discretion, and to approval by the bank's credit
department, consisting at that time of PJ Lucas (Lucas), WT Rodricks
(Rodricks),
Raymond Charles Brennan (Brennan) and above them, Alistair
Fotheringham (Fotheringham).  References to the credit department would
be
direct, with copies being provided to the regional executive.
<P>

299   	On 23 January 1991, Lucas submitted a memorandum to Punch
in the following terms:
<P>

"The proposal as presented has a number of detracting features viz:
<P>

-	The connection has undergone a rapid expansion recently with facilities
almost trebling in 12 months.
<P>

-	No capital contribution by Wright in purchasing Thorpleigh (indeed most other
properties recently acquired have been fully debt
funded).
<P>

-	Proposal to convert facilities to revolving contradicts previous approval
conditions which sought implementation of amortisation
program.  Mr. Wright has
a record of not adhering to reduction arrangements.
<P>

-	Unaudited 1989 financials presented with no interims.
<P>

-	Previous poor record in achieving forecasts.
<P>

-	Cashflow forecast presented indicates only small surplus with no sensitivity
analysis.
<P>

-	Short term of Coles contract and ability to terminate within 3 months.  Can
Wright deliver?  Has the contract been vetted?  Maybe
independent assessment is
appropriate.
<P>

-	Experience with Melrose Meats also raises questions.  Extent of financial
difficulties appears to have worsened from previous
advices.
<P>

-	Volatility of industry"
<P>

300   	It is difficult to criticise any of those concerns.  The
only problem, in my view, is that those concerns were completely
at odds with
the relationship which had been created by the bank with the Wrights to that
point and, in my view, with the terms of
the approval of facilities of 2
January 1991.  
<P>

301   	From the various handwritten notes on the memorandum, it
can be established that it did the bank rounds.  It clearly reached
the
attention of Fotheringham and Buckley.  The general tone of the comments is
caught by one note as follows:  "This is not good
enough".  
<P>

302   	That tone was taken up by JV Helisma (Helisma), a senior
credit inspection manager, in his credit inspection comment, undated,
but made
some time after 14 January 1991 and prior to 20 February 1991.  
<P>

303   	Its timing is fixed by Buckley as having been produced
shortly after the 15 November 1990 meeting.  I think that is clearly
incorrect.
<P>

304   	At the time of this credit inspection comment, Wright was
still pursuing, it seems with the concurrence of Punch, involvement
in a Lane
Cove development which, if it was to proceed, would require further financial
assistance by the bank.  This did not go
unnoticed by Helisma.  His
"<u>Summary/Recommendation</u>" was in the following terms:
<P>

"At time of writing, memorandum dated 14/1/91 has been submitted to CMC
recommending further increase to $30.663M.
<P>

The major concerns regarding this customer are seen to be the level of debt and
present and future servicing.  Critical Assessment
and close monitoring of cash
flow is essential (actuals against budgets) and it is considered customer
should acknowledge in writing
no further major expenditure other than normal
operating costs will be incurred without first the specific written
confirmation from
the Bank.
<P>

File also evidences Director is involving himself in proposed or actual
property developments (e.g. Lane Cove) and it is considered
he should be told
in the strongest terms the Bank does not condone further financial commitments
at this stage irrespective of whether
financing is sought from ANZ or
otherwise.  It is not a question of whether we finance or not, rather, can the
Directors manage the
additional servicing and inherent risks?
<P>

Certainly it is considered the customer must now consolidate and not enter into
further property purchases/large capital improvements
etc.
<P>

Possible avenues to enable reduction of debt need to be fully explored.
<P>

Acknowledgment of increased lending should be obtained from all
guarantors/mortgagors.
<P>

30/6/90 Balance Sheets and up dated budgets/cashflow forecasts are to be
tabled.
<P>

Please respond to these comments by report to CMC by latest 20/2/91.
<P>

Down grade risk to C."
<P>

305   	I think it is fairly safe to say that Helisma's view that
Wright "should be told in the strongest terms the Bank does not
condone further
financial commitments ..."., particularly referring to the Lane Cove
development proposal, to a large extent went
unheeded in the following dealings
by the bank with Wright.  I think the same comment should be made of the
recommendation that Wright
"should acknowledge in writing no further major
expenditure other than normal operating costs (would) be incurred without first
the
specific written confirmation from the Bank".  That message does not appear
to have reached Wright.
<P>

306   	Helisma's comments, I think, were justified by the fact
that the bank records include diary notes signed off by Vaughan and
Punch,
dated respectively 31 January and 4 February 1991, recording further
involvement of the bank in the Lane Cove development
proposal involving Wright.

<P>

307   	Notwithstanding Helisma's recommendation that the group
account be downgraded to risk C, the credit memorandum of Punch of
7 February
1991 recommended retention of risk grade B, the credit memorandum being
submitted in relation to a proposed increase "in
limits to assist with property
purchase, transfer of Melrose Meats ... facilities and transfer of terminating
facilities to revolving".
 
<P>

308   	I regard this memorandum as corroborative of the Wrights'
case so far as it was asserted that the group had enjoyed the warm
support of
the bank in the major decisions taken by the group in 1990 and that this
support continued into 1991 and that it was unknown
to the Wrights that that
support was under severe scrutiny within the bank's credit sector from the
beginning of 1991.  
<P>

309   	In the body of the memorandum, the opinion was expressed
that the risk grading B remained appropriate and, as to terms of
the
facilities, it was stated that they were "regarded as basic subject to annual
review".  It was noted that the major facilities
amounting to $21,000,000 had
previously been terminating facilities but that "due to changed circumstances",
referring to the Coles
contract, the "funding (was) required on an ongoing
basis".  
<P>

310   	In the general remarks that accompanied that credit
memorandum, the group's activities and account were described in terms
which
did not reflect the highly critical comments of the credit sector and could be
described as strongly defensive of the group.
 It reasserted the safety of the
proposed lending limit of $30,600,000 as reflecting "a total security/loan
ratio of 164.2%".
<P>

311   	On 27 February 1991, the annual review of the group
account took place.  It is difficult to reconcile the bank's record of
this
review with the stance taken by the credit sector.  It noted, without any
apparent adverse comment, that the "Group (was) studying
the idea of leasing an
additional 10,000 acres to assist with self sufficiency with regards Coles
requirements however should purchase
of Kindon ... proceed then this would not
likely eventuate".  It was noted that the feedlot activities of the group were
such as
to create significant difficulty in correctly accounting in a way which
gave "a reliable guide as to the profitability of the operation".
 This, I
consider, lent confirmation to the substance of the Wrights' evidence of their
dealings with the bank at that time.  I think
it was also confirmation of the
group's lack of grip of the full cost implications to the group, as distinct
from Esrolem, of the
Coles contract.
<P>

312   	The major demand upon the group imposed by the Coles
arrangement was noted as follows:
<P>

"Between March and December 1991, Group will require some 22,000 cattle.  From
their own resources Group can provide 8,000 requiring
a further 14,000 from the
market.  As previously discussed these purchases will be spread over a 3 month
buying program.  Total amount
required to assist is $5M."
<P>

313   	Far from recording any dissuading of the group from
further financial commitments, it was recorded that Wright was considering
joining in the purchase of a failed crop dusting enterprise.
<P>

314   	At the annual review meeting, it was the evidence of
Wright that he drew to the attention of Punch the bank's confusion between
the
need for temporary additional facility on the overdraft with the transfer of
the Melrose debt from the Queensland section of
the bank.  This evidence was
confirmed by David Wright and, according to the Wrights, Punch acknowledged
that there had been a mistake.
 While Punch does not accept that there was any
confusion within the bank over the purpose of the required additional funding,
nor
that he acknowledged that there was any mistake in that regard, I am
reasonably satisfied that there was some confusion within the
bank and that
this was brought to Punch's attention at the review meeting.  
<P>

315   	There can be no doubting the seriousness with which the
state of the group account was viewed within the bank when regard
is had to the
memorandum of 12 March 1991 from Brennan to Buckley as regional executive.  In
that memorandum he noted the substantial
increase in facilities over the
previous twelve months and, while accepting that the safety of the facilities
did not appear to be
in question, expressed concern over the effect of the
volatilities associated with the rural industry.  He saw an increased need
to
"closely monitor the performance" of the account and criticised the absence of
"up-to-date audited financials".  
<P>

316   	Of particular significance, I think, was his expression
of concern as to the "short term nature of the new Coles contract",
observing
that Coles were "well known for "squeezing" suppliers margins".  It was his
view that a "full and thorough review" was
required by 31 March 1991.  He
declined approval of the transfer of the facilities from terminating to
revolving and expressed disappointment
that additional facilities had been
approved by Punch, notwithstanding the failure of the group to retire the
$5,000,000 bill facility
in November 1990.  
<P>

317   	Brennan's concern about the precarious nature of the
Coles arrangement was timely.  By letter to Wright of 15 March 1991,
Coles
expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangement and notified them "that as from
two weeks from Monday 18th March 1991, our company
will cease purchasing boxed
beef from your company".  To the credit of Wright, he wasted no time in
informing the bank of this development.
 As it happened, shortly after that
time, the notice of termination was withdrawn as confirmed by letter of Coles
to Wright of 4
April 1991.
<P>

318   	The credit memorandum of Punch of 12 April 1991, in my
view, is further corroboration of the Wrights' evidence that they
had been
given no warning of any adverse position being taken within the bank to the
group account up until June 1991.  I think the
memorandum was expressed in
terms which fully supported the group's operations and treated the loan
facilities as safe with a security
to loan ratio of 173%.  His comments on the
credit sector's hindsight remarks of 12 March 1991 were, I think, very
defensive of the
group's position.  The memorandum also responded to Helisma's
`formal comment' of January 1991 and, again, the response was defensive
of the
group account.  
<P>

319   	So far as I have been able to ascertain, no further
communication went to the group to inform it that the principal facilities
were
regarded as terminating and that the approval of them as ongoing had been
withheld by credit.  Of Helisma's suggestion that
some written acknowledgment
should be obtained from Wright that no "further major expenditure" would be
incurred without bank specific
approval, Punch advised that such an
acknowledgment was unnecessary as Wright was "aware of Group position regarding
debt".  
<P>

320   	The concern within the bank would not have been
alleviated by the provision of the group's financials to the end of March
1991,
which showed a year to date deficit of $958,000.  
<P>

321   	Brennan's response to the credit memorandum of 12 April
1991 is that of 6 May 1991 to Buckley as regional executive.  If
one puts aside
the terms of the bank's approval of facilities of 2 January 1991, I regard the
response of Brennan as essentially
reasonable, given the extent of concern
within the bank as to the trend reflected in the group's activities over the
previous twelve
months or so.  He acknowledged that there was "no prospect of
(the facilities) being amortised in the short/medium term" as the debt
had been
incurred for property purchases, improvement and herd build-up.  He also
accepted that the fulfilling of the Coles arrangement
would impose further
demands on the funding in the form of working capital.  
<P>

322   	Not surprisingly, Brennan expressed some concern that the
bank could be asked to provide an additional $10,000,000 to assist
acquisition
of the outstanding Wright interest in Kindon "and increased herd restocking".
In this regard he stressed the importance
of having a "clearly defined formula
of how much working capital (would) be available for herd restocking".  He
expressed alarm at
the absence of signed and audited financials for the year
ended 30 June 1990 and of anything to explain a "$3.5M trading loss for
the Y/E
30.6.90".  He noted with some justification that it had not been demonstrated
to the bank "what the Coles "contract" (was)
worth to the Group."  He stressed
the need for the bank to "urgently address" the following:  "How this Group's
debt (was) to be
appropriately funded"; a "detailed assessment of (the group's)
future funding requirements"; "comprehensive financial analysis";
and a
"detailed safety assessment, ... to include revaluation of <u>all</u>
properties by an independent professional valuer". 
<P>

323   	I think it is reasonably clear from the record of the
conversation between Punch and Wright of 17 May 1991 that even at that
point
Wright had not been informed that the terms of the letter of approval of 2
January 1991 had run into opposition within the
bank, particularly in regard to
the conversion of the facilities to basic.  The Wrights were only informed that
increased facilities
of $2,000,000 were to be limited to 30 June 1991.  
<P>

324   	It was not until 21 June 1991 that the bank confronted
Wright with the changed approach to the account brought about by the
criticism
of the credit sector.  Somewhat ironically, I think, the facsimile of 21 June
1991 was marked "<b>urgent</b>".  The facsimile was in the following terms:
<P>

"It is appropriate given the current circumstances with regards your facility
level, that I raise a number or specific concerns
being felt by the Bank.  This
is particularly important as we are confused as to the Group's future direction
concerning the Coles
relationship, a possible Cargill relationship and the
property acquisition strategies.  Our major concerns are as follows:-
<P>

-	Group facilities are now at a considerable level i.e. $32.6M.  Whilst I
acknowledge considerable progress has been made with regards
to your accounting
system, the Bank is still not in a position to accurately assess the Group's
operations.  Specifically we require
the provision of audited signed
consolidated accounts encompassing the whole of P.A. Wright's operation.
Additionally, cashflows
(budgets) and monthly monitoring should also be
provided on a consolidated basis.  Far greater emphasis on quality financial
information
is needed, especially given the 30th June, 1990 $3.584m loss.
<P>

-	In the past budgets have not been met.  Again I appreciate there have been
good reasons for this, however, it does not provide
a good track record to
present to our Credit Department.
<P>

-	Monitoring information as previously requested has not been provided.  It is
now considered a firm requirement that consolidated
actual results for
comparison to budgets be provided no later than 3 weeks after the end of each
month.
<P>

-	We are also aware that the Group is continuing to purchase backgrounding
cattle.  While we appreciate the potential future benefits
to the Group from
this activity, until we can be convinced that this is a profitable exercise, we
cannot offer our support.  In any
event one of the approval conditions for the
additional $2M granted last month was that this temporary increase is to expire
on 30th
June, 1991.  We are not in a position to extend this approval and
therefore expect this obligation to be honoured.
<P>

-	The Milo financing request was unsatisfactory in terms of timeliness of data
and supporting commentary regarding strategies and
how the operation was to be
incorporated into the Group's business plan.  It was not appropriate to just
assume the Nockatunga date
could be superimposed.
<P>

In summary, the Bank is concerned by the speed of the Group's developments,
particularly given the inadequacies of the accounting
system.  We have been
virtually asked to support the Group on a security basis alone because of the
inability to provide supporting
cashflow information.
<P>

Obviously, as in the past, we are more than happy to continue to support
Group's endeavours.  However, the time has now come whereby
we need to take
stock of the situation before further commitments are made.
<P>

Please feel free to call me to discuss any aspect of this letter."
<P>

325   	The events immediately preceding that facsimile, I think,
are worth noting.  In the second half of May there were a number
of
communications or meetings between the Wrights and the bank in which the
Wrights resisted the suggestion which had emanated from
the credit sector that
the group submit its affairs to an independent financial investigation.   As
appears later in these reasons,
that resistance led to unfortunate
repercussions in the second half of 1991.
<P>

326   	Wright was also in discussion with Punch and Vaughan
concerning the possibility of the group purchasing additional property
in the
form of the outstanding interest in Kindon; a south west Queensland property
known as Milo, listed for auction and expected
to bring about $3,000,000, and
another property known as Dynevor Downs, also situated in south west
Queensland.  It was the evidence
of the Wrights that these matters were raised
without any intimation from the bank that additional borrowing would not be
tolerated
and I accept this evidence.  
<P>

327   	There was a diary note of Vaughan, signed off by him and
Punch, of 21 May 1991, which recorded the fact that at a meeting
that day with
Wright, he had informed them of the listing of Milo Station for auction.  That
is recorded in the following terms:
<P>

"David has his eye on Milo Station in south west Queensland.  Auction date is
26 June 91, expected price is $3 to $4M.  David believes
it would compliment
(sic) the Coles business because it could carry 20,000 breeding cattle.  He
wants to take (Punch) on a trip to
view this property."
<P>

328   	If Wright had been informed that his borrowing days were
over, this is the record where one would expect to have that communication
noted.  The diary note reflected the trouble the Wrights were experiencing in
providing reliable financials to the bank, mainly as
a result of the difficulty
in costing the effect of the supply to Coles.  This record confirmed the
evidence of David Wright that
the group had been unable to put in place an
"appropriate methodology for producing monthly accounts in the feedlot, which
... (had)
held up the production of meaningful reports for the group".  This
information was given to the bank at a meeting of 27 May 1991
at Armidale which
was attended by Punch and Vaughan, on behalf of the bank, and Wright, Phillip
Wright, Nicholls, Eric Bruce Hudson
(Hudson) and David Wright, on behalf of the
group.  Hudson had been engaged by PAWS as a financial controller in September
1990 whose
"prime responsibility", initially, was "to develop a computer model
to enable PAWS to track livestock produced by it, or acquired
by it, and
subsequently placed on feed for the purpose of slaughter and supply to ...
Coles."
<P>

329   	It is this state of affairs that has led me to the
conclusion that the group's involvement with Coles moved far too quickly
for
its financial health and, with the admitted inability of the group to provide
"meaningful reports" to the bank, it is difficult
to see how the group could be
regarded as having the costs to the group of the Coles supply under control.

<P>

330   	There followed a meeting with Punch and Buckley at
Wallamumbi on 11 and 12 June 1991, they having attending the property
on the
occasion of the dispersal sale of the stud cattle.  It was the evidence of
Wright and David Wright that the possibility of
the group acquiring Milo or
Dynevor Downs and of the Wrights' intention to inspect those properties was
raised with Punch and Buckley.
 David Wright, in fact, was at Dynevor Downs on
21 June 1991 when Hudson relayed to him receipt of the bank's facsimile of 21
June
1991.  According to the Wrights, neither Buckley nor Punch raised any
objection to their proposal to visit those Queensland properties
and, more
particularly, there was no suggestion that the bank would not countenance
further borrowings by the group.  
<P>

331   	Buckley's version of his attendance at the stud dispersal
sale does not accord with the recollection of the Wrights.  He
disputed that
there was any reference to the 1988 strategy or the group's ten year program.
More particularly, in relation to the
Milo and Dynevor Down properties, it was
his recollection that in discussion on the possible acquisition by the group of
those properties,
he "cut the presentation short", having had a private aside
with Punch highly critical of the suggestion that the bank should consider
100%
financing of such an acquisition.  
<P>

332   	I think it is necessary to look at the substance of the
Wrights' evidence rather than the detail, given the absence of contemporaneous
records and the effect of the lapse of time upon the memory of those involved
in the conversations.  However, mindful of the fact
that inspection of the
properties by the Wrights followed the stud cattle sales, I doubt that the bank
voiced any opposition to the
proposed inspection with the view to the group
exploring further acquisitions. 
<P>

333   	Wright, David Wright and Phillip Wright had inspected
Milo on 15 and 16 June 1991.  On that trip they were accompanied by
a real
estate agent and Nicholls.  Immediately following that inspection, David Wright
submitted an application to the bank for a
further facility of $3,000,000 to
fund the acquisition of Milo and related livestock.  Accompanying that
application was a financial
projection which David Wright described as
"conservative" and, on a stand alone basis, reflected a profit in every year
over a 13
year forecast, save for the year 1992.  It also showed extinguishment
of debt by 2001.  
<P>

334   	While it is clear that no commitment had been made by the
bank to provide additional finance for the acquisition of Milo
Station, it is
plain, I think, that the Wrights had not been informed of the hardened attitude
which had developed within the bank
and which would have made the inspection of
Milo Station and Dynevor Downs pointless.  
<P>

335   	Against that background, the terms of the bank's
facsimile of 21 June 1991 may be contrasted.  It is not surprising that
Wright
and David Wright in separate dealings with the bank, upon receipt of that
facsimile, expressed their strong indignation to
the change in attitude by the
bank as reflected in the facsimile.
<P>

336   	On 22 June 1991, Buckley visited Wallamumbi, while
travelling north on vacation with his family.  Wright took the opportunity
of
taking him to task on what Wright saw as the injustice of the requirements of
the bank which he considered threatened the ability
of the Wrights to supply
Coles under the current arrangement.  David Wright travelled to Sydney and had
a meeting with Punch at which
similar concerns were expressed.  It is plain
enough that neither meeting assisted the group's cause.  
<P>

337   	In the face of that situation, the group explored,
apparently without success, the possibility of replacing the ANZ facilities
with a borrowing from the National Australia Bank.  
<P>

338   	An acrimonious meeting took place on 1 August 1991 in
Armidale attended by Wright, David Wright, Philip Wright, Nicholls,
Robertson,
Hudson, Buckley, Armitage, Vaughan and Keith Skinner (Skinner), a partner in
Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu (Deloitte).  Skinner
was present, at the request of the
bank, preparatory to conducting an independent investigation of the group's
affairs.  It was at
this meeting that Buckley threatened to appoint a receiver
if Wright did not accede to the bank's requirements.  I doubt whether
the bank
can be fairly criticised for insisting upon such an investigation: the way in
which it was handled by Buckley, I think,
left a lot to be desired.  
<P>

339   	Nicholls, Robertson and Hudson corroborate the thrust of
the Wrights' evidence of this meeting.  Each of those witnesses
gave evidence
in a straightforward way and, I thought, to the best of their recollection.
Notwithstanding some of the detail of Hudson's
statements of evidence-in-chief,
I thought his memory in the witness box did not match that level of detail.
Robertson may have been
disposed to advocate the group's case.  However, I
found each of Nicholls, Robertson and Hudson to be frank in response to
cross-examination.
 
<P>

340   	I accept that, at this meeting, the Wrights remonstrated
with the bank's representatives over the about-face of the bank
in relation to
the group account.  They contrasted the bank's then current approach with the
past support of the group's 1988 strategy.
 In general terms, that fell on deaf
ears.  Buckley voiced the bank's insistence on the appointment of Skinner to
conduct an investigation
in terms that were far from conciliatory.  He
described the history of the group account in deprecatory terms which seem, in
part,
unjustified and, I think, antagonistic.  He could not be accused of a
lack of clarity in conveying the level of the bank's insistence
on the
appointment of Skinner:  the group either agreed to it or faced the appointment
of a receiver.  
<P>

341   	In the context of Wright's resistance to such an
appointment earlier in 1990, there was justification for the expression
of some
firmness in setting out the bank's requirement which, in my view, was a
reasonable one.  
<P>

342   	On 9 July 1991, Buckley had communicated with Wright by
facsimile in which he stressed the importance which the bank would
place upon
Skinner's evaluation of the group's performance.  In that facsimile, Buckley
set out the bank's requirements which, I
think, were unexceptional in the sense
that they concentrated on the much improved level of financial reporting by the
group.  
<P>

343   	The evidence of David Wright was that the bank did not
understand or fully grasp the detail of the financial information
provided to
them, particularly following the meeting of 27 May 1991.  However, I have no
doubt that the level of financial reporting
by the group, particularly in late
1990 and during the first half of 1991, had been inadequate, mainly due to the
difficulties in
identifying the costs to the group associated with the
requirements of the Coles contract:  particularly was that so in relation
to
the costs of feedlotting and of purchase of cattle where the group's herd did
not satisfy the Coles specification.
<P>

344   	Buckley described in the witness box his sympathy with
the Wrights' position, and the unsavoury nature of the task confronting
him in
protecting the bank's interests in relation to the group account.  However, I
think the evidence of the Wrights of their dealings
with him, particularly from
1 August 1991, reflected little of that attitude.
<P>

345   	Where I think the bank is open to criticism is in the
stand taken in the facsimile of 21 June concerning the group's funding
requirement for purchasing and "backgrounding cattle".  In that facsimile, the
Wrights were notified that the bank would not support
that requirement and that
the temporary facility of $2,000,000 was required to be retired at 30 June
1991.  Given the circumstances
in which that facility was initially raised, in
my view, that requirement was both unreasonable and contrary to the express
basis
upon which it had been provided by the bank.  As it happened, that
requirement was relaxed in circumstances that I think reflected
much of the way
in which the bank, thereafter, handled the group account.  
<P>

346   	In a memorandum from Punch to Lucas of 3 July 1991, Punch
sought approval for the extension of the $2,000,000 temporary bill
line, in
addition to "further temporary assistance of $550,000 for a two week period
expiring 15/7/91 pending receipt of full CM
by no later than 15/7/91".  It was
noted that the additional assistance was required for "urgent purchases of
cattle" for the Coles
contract.  I think the general terms of that memorandum
reflected Punch's continued sympathy with the group's objectives.  One must
take the terms of his facsimile of 21 June 1991 as an expression of the credit
sector's view of the group account.
<P>

347   	The response of the credit sector to Punch's memorandum
is a strong reflection of the gulf between the way in which the account
had
been handled by the bank in dealings with the group prior to June 1991 and the
credit sector's view of the account.  Lucas' memorandum
to Punch of 4 July 1991
is set out below to that point:
<P>

"Your request for further temporary assistance of $550K is declined.  The
extension of the CBAD facility of $2M expiring 1/7/91
has already been rolled
over until 31/7/91 with the authority of SMBB.  We do not confirm your action
but it is noted.
<P>

Mr Wright has once again demonstrated his absolute contempt for arrangements
with this Bank.  The temporary CBAD facility of $2M
was to be repaid from the
sale of its stud cattle.  Without consultation with us he has elected,
unilaterally, to utilise these proceeds
to purchase other cattle and having
already committed the proceeds, tells us, only upon maturity, that his facility
repayment will
not be effected.
<P>

Behaviour such as this puts at risk with us Mr Wright's business ethics and
credibility.
<P>

We are not satisfied that Mr Wright's contract with Coles is profitable nor
indeed any other part of his business activities yet
we still do not appear to
have had these matters investigated.
<P>

We will await your further advices, due no later than 15/7/91, to decide what
further action may be required with this account."
<P>

348   	In substance, I regard that memorandum as unreasonable,
while accepting the legitimacy of the bank's concern over the failure
of the
group to satisfy the bank of the financial benefit to it of the Coles contract.

<P>

349   	However, in a manner which was somewhat typical of the
way in which the bank dealt with the group account, further accommodation
was
provided to the Wrights in the following circumstances.  The overview comment
of Lucas, as senior manager, and Brennan, as chief
manager of credit, of 16
July 1991 on the group's request for further accommodation was in the following
terms:
<P>

"We reluctantly support the increased limit facility but only to ensure that Mr
Wright's business reputation within the livestock
industry is not impaired to
the detriment of our involvement as his banker.  The increased facility is to
be cleared by 26/7/91 in
line with CFF and Mr Wright is to give us his
<u>written</u> undertaking not to undertake any further cattle/property
purchases or other major capital investments until we have DRT's investigating
report."
<P>

350   	The approval facsimile of 19 July 1991 was in the
following terms:
<P>

"Approval of extension of $2M funding (originally due to be repaid 30/6/91)
until 31/8/91.  This $2M has been drawn as $1.2M on
overdraft and $800,000 on
Commercial Bills.
<P>

Approval of a further $400,000 facility to be drawn as overdraft, until
26/7/91.   Written confirmation from P A Wright &amp; Sons
Pty Ltd undertaking
not to undertake any further cattle/property purchases or other major capital
investments until the Deloittes
investigative report is to hand are conditions
of approval.  Loan approval fee is $4000." 
<P>

351   	By that approval, the overall facilities of the group
totalled $33,033,000.  Wright challenged the condition of approval
requiring
his undertaking not to purchase any further cattle pending the Deloitte report.
In this, I think, his stand was reasonable.
 However, notwithstanding my
criticism of the bank's approach to temporary funding of cattle purchases for
the Coles supply, the
evidence is clear, I think, that the stand taken by the
bank in relation to that matter did not impede the flow of beef to Coles.
 It
appears that the additional $400,000 temporary facility approved on 19 July
1991 was not drawn upon and, as at 19 July 1991,
the evidence suggested that
the Wrights had sufficient background cattle to service the Coles contract
until the end of the year.
 
<P>

352   	That statement needs some qualification in that there
remained the possibility of the need to purchase additional cattle
when the
group's herd earmarked for the Coles contract did not meet specification.
However, the tightening of credit by the bank
did not cause any interruption of
the supply of beef to Coles:  a matter which is addressed later in these
reasons.  
<P>

353   	At the end of July 1991, Punch relinquished control of
the bank's rural portfolio, although he remained within the business
banking
sector in which he reported to Buckley.  As a result, he did not have any
direct involvement with the group account and that
position remained so until
September 1993 when he resumed involvement with the account following another
change of portfolio responsibilities.
 
<P>

354   	Commencing in August 1991, Armitage assumed
responsibility of the account and, I think, in line with the approach to the
group account adopted by Punch, he sought and obtained approval for an increase
in the overdraft limit to $3,000,000, representing
an increase in $650,000 as
recorded in the diary note of 2 August 1991.
<P>

355   	Wright bowed to the bank's insistence upon an immediate
review of the group's affairs by Skinner following the 1 August 1991
meeting
and that report was produced on 2 September 1991.  It is the contention of the
group that the devotion of the Wrights' time
to the provision of information
for the purpose of that report deprived them of valuable negotiating time with
Coles' representatives
for the continuation of supply on a long term basis.
That is also addressed later in these reasons.
<P>

356   	The Deloitte report, on balance, I think was favourable
to the group's position.  For the purpose of the report, Deloitte
prepared an
"estimated consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as at 30 June
1991".  That was done in order to assess the
bank's security position and, in
summary, the statement indicated a realisable value of $58,460,136 compared
with the then indebtedness
to the bank of $30,980,290.  That statement excluded
the Kindon interest of the group.  
<P>

357   	It was noted that the statement based property values "at
an estimated realisable value equivalent to the latest fair market
valuations
conducted by the Bank", while livestock was included "at current market value".
The report noted that Wright viewed the
statement as an undervaluation of
assets by approximately fifty per cent.  A "reconstructed estimated livestock
trading profit and
loss for the 12 months to 30 June 1991" was prepared by
Skinner which indicated a loss of approximately $2,500,000. 
<P>

358   	Similarly, a projected profit and loss for the twelve
months ended 30 June 1992 was constructed which showed a loss of approximately
$220,000 "projected on substantially reduced expenses" amounting to
approximately $1,190,000.  
<P>

359   	In commenting on the ten year forecast provided by the
group, it is significant, I think, that Skinner considered that although
the
model had not been examined in detail, it demonstrated "that after breeding
herd numbers reach targeted levels and offspring
are sufficient to turnoff say
twenty to twenty one thousand head per year sufficient profits would be
generated to enable the Group
to repay the majority of its existing
indebtedness over the ten year period".
<P>

360   	Cashflow projections prepared by Skinner showed a peak
overdraft requirement of $3,750,729 which represented an excess over
the then
current overdraft facility of approximately $1,400,000, with no allowance for
further livestock purchases from August 1991
onwards.  In that regard, the
group provided Skinner with projected requirements totalling $3,190,000 arising
during the months of
March, April and May 1992.  I think it is clear from the
report that the feedlot operation was still causing difficulties to the
group
in implementing an adequate system of reporting.
<P>

361   	After recounting the group's management strategy, the
view was expressed that the "Group's strategy of attempting to eliminate
adverse movements in livestock numbers and prices and to control meat product
prices is sound", but sounded a warning that risk "must
be associated with
having predominantly one customer, Coles".  It was the general view that the
"Group may experience difficulty
in servicing its current indebtedness if any
adverse movements to budget (were) experienced or if profitability (was) not
enhanced
in the forecast period through its strategy of increasing its business
by strengthening its relationships with Coles and Cargill.
 There (was) little
or no scope to absorb any adverse contingencies that may arise".  
<P>

362   	In my view, the report furnished insufficient basis for
the bank's withdrawal of support, for example, by reversing basic
facilities
into terminating facilities or by withholding funding of a temporary nature
necessary to meet the vicissitudes in the
financial requirements to fund the
Coles supply.  
<P>

363   	In fact, in line with the report, a credit memorandum was
submitted by Armitage on 9 September 1991, the purpose of which
was expressed
as seeking an "increase in credit limits beyond own credit approval discretion
and update recent developments", presumably
referring to the Deloitte report
which was attached to the memorandum.  In "<b><u>general remarks</u></b>", the
"<u>Current Position</u>" contained the following observation:
<P>

"Obviously the major concern of the Bank is not as to safety of its exposure in
the short term ... but the long term viability of
operations ...".
<P>

364   	In an observation concerning the "<u>Future Direction of
Group</u>", Armitage summarised the Wright's position, in my view accurately,
as follows:
<P>

"The biggest difficulty with this connection is that since 1989, substantial
expansionary activity has not been followed by a period
of consolidation to
enable performance to be monitored accurately.  Mr Wright is not however the
type of individual that sits on
his hands for too long and the group is
therefore a constantly moving target."
<P>

365   	The total limit of borrowings proposed in the memorandum
was $34,057,000.  I think an example of Armitage's "moving target"
was the fact
that at this time Wright was still involved in negotiations with Cargill which
contemplated the supply by the group
of up to 100,000 head of cattle per year
which would require agistment on properties, transport to abattoir, boning and
export to
the United States, in addition to supplying the Coles
requirements.
<P>

366   	Brennan's overview comment of 24 September 1991 in
relation to his credit memorandum, I think, was reasonable and was reflected
in
the bank's letter of offer of 30 September 1991.  
<P>

367   	I think my view of the Deloitte report as being, on
balance, favourable to the Wrights is reflected in Brennan's overview
comment.
While regarding the "request for further working capital assistance (as) most
unwelcome", Brennan acknowledged that the
Deloitte report confirmed that "the
Group (remained) viable and that its strategy of vertical integration (was)
sound".  At the same
time he noted the adverse aspects of the report,
particularly in relation to the vulnerability of the group to adverse
contingencies
and the inadequacy of financial reporting systems as commented
upon in the report.
<P>

368   	The letter of offer of 30 September 1991 offered
overdraft facilities of $2,000,000, commercial bill lines totalling $28,800,000
which, together with other facilities, including a $2,000,000 overdraft
facility for Esrolem, brought the total limit to $34,310,000.
 The overdraft
facility of $4,000,000 was to be reduced to $3,000,000 on 15 November 1991
reducing to $2,500,000 at 1 January 1992
and was subject to review on 13 June
1992.  
<P>

369   	The letter of offer was qualified by a further letter
from Armitage to Wright of 1 October 1991, informing him that the letter
was
subject to the approval of the credit department.  This tension between
business banking and the credit department, I think,
was most marked at this
period and it brought forward a memorandum of Armitage of 3 October 1991 in the
following terms:
<P>

"I refer to the above and your comments thereon requesting clients to refrain
from issuing cheques until approval or otherwise is
obtained from DHQ.
<P>

It is important to note the following:
<P>

i)	CM was submitted 9/9/91 seeking an increase in facilities to cover essential
working capital requirements with expected peak
of $3.75mill to reduce by
15/11/91 from trade receipts.  Almost four weeks have passed since submission
of advices and we cannot
expect a client to close down his operation for that
period of time given the nature of the operation.
<P>

ii)	It is difficult to inform a group that is vertically integrated to stop
purchasing the stock required to maintain future sale
commitments.  This is
particularly important given that stock acquired take some 90 days to be
fattened and processed for sale to
Coles.  Should client stop purchasing it
will create a substantial gap in their throughput capacity and cattle cannot
always be purchased
to fill those gaps at a later date.  Additionally, this
would have an impact on the overall profitability of operations through non
utilisation of the groups substantial asset base.
<P>

iii)	The relationship with this long standing group has become severely
strained due to our inability to come to grips with the
factors that influenced
the substantial change in the direction of this group.  This change in
direction/strategy commenced in 1988
and the full impact of those changes were
not fully understood by the Bank.
<P>

Additionally the current (1991 FYE) trading losses have been alluded to in
early 1990 yet substantial growth has been supported
by the Bank to date.
<P>

Client is therefore of the opinion that we do not truly understand his
business, a position which we can only hope to improve over
time.
<P>

We are now in a position whereby we believe we are able to control the growth
of the client, and they have been informed that if
we cannot support that
growth we will advise our situation at the earliest opportunity.  Client has no
difficulty with this concept
and to use his words "that's all I want".
<P>

In summation it is felt that the position we are now faced with has been
brought about by a number of factors not all of which can
be blamed on the
client.  Accordingly we seek an urgent response to our CM of 9/9/91 to enable
client to be advised of our decision
and remove the current uncertainty of his
relationship with ourselves.
<P>

With regard to comment on deposits outstanding T/R of 1/10/91 indicated that
large deposit of $341,401 was processed to account
as indicated at T/R of
30/9/91."
<P>

370   	It was not until 24 October 1991 that the bank formally
advised the Wrights that the Melbourne credit department had confirmed
the
terms of the facility of 30 September 1991. 
<P>

371   	While not underestimating the difficulties which the
bank's control over borrowings visited upon the group, it is my view
that it
had no lasting effect upon the group's ability to run the properties under its
control and to service the Coles contract.
 As earlier noted, the group's case
is that Wright's commitment to the preparation of the Deloitte report and the
behaviour of the
bank towards the account in this period proved fatal to
negotiations with Coles.  This is addressed later in these reasons.
<P>

372   	I think it is a matter of considerable misfortune that
towards the end of 1991 the group's operations began to be affected
by dry
conditions which developed into a persistent and severe drought.  Armitage
adverted to this in his credit memorandum of 9
September 1991 in which he noted
that "(d)espite drought proofing of total operation continuation of current dry
conditions will
depress the cattle market generally thereby impacting upon the
pastoral profitability".
<P>

373   	On 29 October 1991, Hudson forwarded the group's monthly
report for September 1991.  In that report it was noted that sales
from
feedlots to third parties were well below budget "due to depressed market
conditions".  It was further noted that "Administration
and overhead expenses
for P.A. Wright exceeded budget for the month mainly due to fodder purchases to
cope with the worsening drought".
 Clearly the effect of the drought was a
major factor in the inability of the group to effect the required reduction of
the overdraft
on 15 November 1991.  
<P>

374   	On 1 November 1991, Hudson provided Armitage with a
cashflow projection for November with a commentary which noted "market
uncertainty" and the necessity to re-estimate budget forecasts to increase
costs of "feed and cartage of feed, for drought affected
stock on New England
Properties".  The commentary closed with advice that the overdraft reduction
could not be met as a result.
<P>

375   	There followed a meeting in Armidale on 11 November 1991
attended by Wright, Phillip and David Wright, Nicholls, Hudson,
Robertson,
Armitage and Vaughan.  It covered a wide range of topics and it is clear from
the record of the group's feedlot activities
that the drought was having an
adverse effect on the group's trading.  The audited accounts which were
required four months after
year's end were not expected until "end December 91
at the earliest".  In relation to the overdraft, it was "agreed to delay a full
discussion of the cash flow until (the) next meeting due 26/11/91".  
<P>

376   	A follow-up facsimile of Hudson to Vaughan of 20 November
1991 noted drought costs of cartage and feeding in the vicinity
of $200,000 to
mid November.  While the overdraft was reduced within the required limit as at
20 November 1991, Armitage's memorandum
of that date anticipated an excess
position arising due to the drought conditions prevailing.  
<P>

377   	The parties met again on 26 November 1991 and it is clear
from the information provided by the group that the drought had
pushed feeding
costs well beyond budget by some several hundred thousand dollars.  Throughout
this period, negotiations with Coles
and Cargill were continuing and on both
fronts the bank was being kept informed by the Wrights.
<P>

378   	As at 9 December 1991, the Wrights had refrained from
signing the bank's previous letter of offer and that was replaced by
a fresh
offer of 9 December 1991 for acceptance by Wright.  That was accompanied by a
note from Armitage which observed that the
previous terms had been maintained,
except as to a requirement in relation to the obtaining of a further
independent accountant's
report.  The Wrights were advised that business
banking was 
<P>

"pursuing the following:-
<P>

-	Review of the fee levels.
<P>

-	Review of the valuation requirement [referring to valuation of properties
requirement].
<P>

-	Extension of $3m Overdraft due to reduce to $2.5m on 31/12/91 until
15/02/92."
<P>

The request for extension of overdraft facilities was the subject of Armitage's
credit memorandum of 12 December 1991.  
<P>

379   	The attitude within the credit department, in my view,
lacked recognition of the role the bank had played in the debt situation
confronting the group, and the nature of the facilities provided to the group
as at 2 January 1991.  However, in its dealings with
the group account, the
bank continued to support the group's requirements. 
<P>

380   	The evidence does not justify a conclusion, in my view,
that the group was unable to effectively operate the group's properties
in
1991, nor was the group prevented from servicing the Coles contract:  a matter
which is further addressed later in these reasons.
 At the same time, the tight
rein on the provision of working capital imposed by the bank would have made
the conduct of those operations,
in trying drought conditions, extraordinarily
difficult. 
<P>

381   	I think the evidence disclosed that despite continuing
criticism of, or, at least, a lack of sympathy for, the Wrights' position
within the credit department, Armitage maintained support for the account, as
reflected in his favouring the move by the Wrights
to gain control of Kindon
with Cargill finance.  The credit department met that proposal with "surprise
that the company (was) prepared
to enter additional commitments ... given that
its resources (were) stretched ...".  
<P>

382   	On 9 December 1991, the credit sector required business
banking to "submit advices covering this acquisition, particularly
addressing
<u>overall</u> serviceability aspects, by say 15/1/92".  Armitage responded to
that requirement in his memorandum of 10 December 1991 describing
it as
"unrealistic" and seeking deferment "on the basis that analysis (would) be
undertaken when Mr Wright (made) a decision re acquisition".
 Of the proposal,
Armitage expressed the view that "commercially (the credit department) would
have to consider providing lending"
if the acquisition could be shown to be
justifiable on a "stand alone basis". 
<P>

383   	In Armitage's credit memorandum of 12 December 1991, in
line with his communication to Wright of 9 December 1991, he recommended
further temporary overdraft accommodation until 16 February 1992.  He
maintained the position that the security position was safe
and he opposed the
credit sector's requirement of full scale evaluation of the group's properties
as being of secondary importance
and unduly burdensome to the group.  It was
his recommendation that there be a valuation of Wallamumbi as representative of
land
values in the New England area, in which most of the group's properties
were situated.
<P>

384   	The stringent control over the provision of funds for
working capital was maintained by the bank in the first quarter of
1992.  That
has been the subject of strong criticism by the Wrights, particularly for the
effect it was said to have had on their
negotiations with Coles, as dealt with
later in these reasons.  
<P>

385   	Continued tension between the credit department and
business banking over the handling of the Wrights' account continued
on much
the same lines into 1992.  However, I think the evidence disclosed that the
bank maintained support of the group throughout
that period, although the
process was laboured and effected only after extensive communications between
the bank and the Wrights.
 
<P>

386   	The first significant meeting in the new year took place
on 17 January 1992 in Armidale.  It was attended by the three Wrights,
Hudson,
Nicholls and Robertson with Armitage and Vaughan representing the bank.  The
plight of the group in the continuing drought
conditions remained a significant
topic with feeding costs over the previous six months noted as being $500,000,
subject to a rebate.
 It was held at a time when it was thought the Cargill
joint venture was close to realisation and the Wrights were pursuing long
term
arrangements with Coles.  
<P>

387   	Those arrangements with Coles, as disclosed to the bank
by the Wrights, were not without difficulties.  The price at which
boxed meat
was being supplied by the group had been arrived at on the basis of a weekly
supply volume of some 1,000 head whereas,
in January and February 1992, the
supply volume was half that rate and represented, I am satisfied, a losing
proposition to the group.
 
<P>

388   	The point of difference between the bank and the group
over this state of affairs was the Wrights' unwillingness to seek
an increase
in price from Coles for fear of jeopardising the negotiations with Coles for a
long term supply contract.  The bank took
the position that it was not
reasonable for the group to expect bank support for the propping up of that
losing arrangement:  albeit,
in the Wrights' eyes, a temporary arrangement
until such time as a fixed term supply contract with Coles could be put in
place.
<P>

389   	There was some inconsistency in the evidence of the
Wrights and of the bank as to the extent to which the bank involved itself
in
this problem.  I think it is sufficient to say that the bank's attitude, in
practical terms, left little alternative to Wright
other than to seek, against
his wishes, an increase in the supply price to Coles.  This aspect of the Coles
negotiations is further
examined later in these reasons.
<P>

390   	Further evidence of Armitage's assessment of Wright, as
somebody who would not sit on his hands for long, is recorded in
the January 17
meeting with the note that Wright was in discussion with Smorgon Consolidated
Industries (Smorgons), an organisation
with extensive experience in the beef
industry, with the view to entering into a deal similar to that being
negotiated with Cargill.
 Something of the grand scale of expanded operations
in Wright's mind was the role envisaged for Kindon "as a mega feedlot to 80,000
head (i.e. 60 day turnover) ...".
<P>

391   	In relation to the group's proposed purchase of the
outstanding interest in Kindon, Wright posed what must have been a challenging
suggestion that the bank fund $3,200,000 towards the acquisition cost:  this
was in the context of the provision of projected results
for the year ended 30
June 1992 which reflected a deteriorating position due to drought and drought
related conditions.  
<P>

392   	Armitage's response to the Kindon acquisition and the
difficulties associated with servicing increased debt facility was
"that the
preferred option for the acquisition of Kindon should be through equity
injection rather than debt increase ... in accordance
with ... discussions over
recent months".  
<P>

393   	In reviewing cashflow requirements, Armitage noted that
an increase in bill line facility by $1,200,000 would allow "YTD
actual receipt
to closely match budget".  
<P>

394   	As recorded in Armitage's diary note of the meeting of 17
January, the stand taken by the bank at the meeting, in my view,
was
reasonable, given the level of concern within the bank as to the viability of
the group's operations.  In particular, it was
expected by the bank that
cashflows would be under "extreme pressure", prompting the view that cattle
sales should be accelerated
"to the earliest possible time" and "Coles pricing
mechanism should be activated to bring the Esrolem returns in line with budget
...".  It was noted that the audited accounts, well overdue at that stage, were
still not available.  Nor was any draft.  
<P>

395   	In line with the subject matter of the discussion at that
meeting, Armitage's credit memorandum of 21 February 1992 sought
approval of an
increased overdraft facility of $1,700,000.  I think it is clear from the
credit memorandum that Armitage recognised
the need to assist the group in the
face of the continuing drought conditions which he recorded as costing the
group something in
the order of $5,200 a day, with hundreds of cattle destined
for the Coles pipeline being forced into the open market due to the effect
of
the drought on their condition.  At the same time, it was noted that calving
rates were down by nearly 3,000 head and stock deaths
exceeded estimates.  
<P>

396   	The group's monthly report for January of 24 February
1992 could only have tested the nerve of Armitage, devoted as it was,
to a
cashflow under strain, largely due to drought related factors.  In relation to
Esrolem, the cost detriment to the group from
1 January 1992 was noted as
likely to be in the order of $135,000.  
<P>

397   	The credit department's response to the credit memorandum
of 21 February 1992 was predictable.  Rodricks, as senior manager,
credit,
responded to it on 2 March 1992.  He commented unfavourably on the absence of
audited financials for the year ended 30 June
1991.  After reviewing all of the
negative aspects of the account, it contained the following response to the
request for increased
funding:
<P>

"We are not disposed to expanding our involvement, and in this regard, are
willing to only fund the feed and admin costs of $0.5M.
 Principals are to be
clearly advised that the sale programme should be accelerated, so that OD
facilities revert to the basic $1.15M
as soon as possible."
<P>

398   	He recommended that the bank's policy should be "to
pursue downsizing", recording nervousness over the group's dependence
on one
major customer, Coles.  He concluded with the comment that the bank's
"involvement (was) at a peak".  It is difficult to criticise
the apprehension
expressed over the dependence of the group on Coles.  It was a matter that had
been raised by Skinner and Brennan.
 The successful negotiation of the one year
supply contract had been the telling factor in the bank converting facilities
from terminating
to basic.  The profitability and extension of that supply
arrangement was, in my view, a crucial element in the bank's relationship
with
the group.
<P>

399   	On 3 March 1992 there was a meeting with Wright,
Robertson, Buckley, Vaughan and Armitage in which accounts to the year ended
30
June 1991 were presented which showed a "consolidated loss of $3.429m". 
<P>

400   	In relation to the credit memorandum of 21 February and
Rodrick's comment on it, Brennan as chief manager, credit, in his
memorandum of
9 March 1992, favoured a strategy which was not entirely adverse to the group
and, in my view, was not unreasonable.
 It was expressed in the following
terms:
<P>

"Your comments at page 4 summarise the overall position `... we are
uncomfortable with the current level of our involvement and
we should pursue
downsizing' (assumably of debt).
<P>

I support this view, however the reality of life is that we have the asset on
the books and short of a fire-sale, which would generate
a large loss to the
Bank, we have no option but devise, implement and monitor a sound work-out
strategy.
<P>

The group have made mistakes and have bitten off a lot, but their strategy,
apart from the growth in debt, is sound.  They have
unfortunately suffered at
the hands of the drought, the effects of which will impact cash flows for a few
more months.
<P>

Accordingly, provision of facilities to 15/4/92 is supported, but well before
that date we have to finalise:
<P>

			&#183;	all loose-ends as set out in your reply
<P>

			&#183;	facilities for six months
<P>

			&#183;	monitoring procedures for the relationship 
<P>

			&#183;	a strategy plan which we will support and they will not deviate
from.
<P>

In essence, this relationship has to be bedded down.  It is not harmonious at
either level, ie Customer/Region or Region/Credit
- enough is enough, we must
agree a plan and when all parties have given their imprimateur (sic), make it
work within agreed parameters.
 Credit must be pro-active with the Region as in
the recent Vickery episode."
<P>

401   	The response of credit was to restrict the approval
sought in the credit memorandum of 21 February 1991 of a temporary overdraft
facility of $1,700,000 to $500,000 as representing the feed and administration
costs of the group for which assistance was required.
 The balance had been
earmarked for cattle to go into the Coles pipeline:  it being noted that a
fixed term contract with Coles was
still being negotiated.
<P>

402   	Armitage submitted a further credit memorandum of 11
March 1992 in which he continued to seek approval of the $1,700,000
temporary
facility.  In his review of what he described as a disappointing group loss of
$3,429,000 for the year ended 30 June 1991,
he saw something of a silver lining
in the form of "non recurring expenditure" in 1991 in respect of several items
totalling $3,342,723,
which he "considered achievable".  On that basis, the
group's operations could be treated as having "recorded a roughly break even
result for FYE 06/91".  He also noted the "increased income earning potential
of the group through changed breeding herd (programme
of the group) during the
years 1988-1993" involved a loss of "trading stock income during this period
(which would) be more than
offset by the natural herd increases and almost
doubling in income".
<P>

403   	Armitage's review of the group's strategy was expressed
in terms which emphasised the possible benefits of the Cargill joint
venture
and of the Coles supply contract, allied to the acquisition of Kindon.  At that
stage, negotiation between Wright and Cargill
were well advanced with draft
partnership agreement documents under review.
<P>

404   	The credit memorandum of 11 March 1992 contained a
comment by Armitage that, I think, indicated business banking's level
of
support of the group's position, namely:
<P>

"It is acknowledged that cash flow situation is disappointing however such is
drought influenced.  To require client to sell cattle
out of condition or
cattle which are part of the breeding herd will severely impact on future cash
flows and can be likened to selling
a manufacturers plant and equipment to
reduce working capital borrowing."
<P>

405   	This approach was conveyed to Wright in the facsimile of
Armitage of 19 March 1992 in the following terms: 
<P>

"In summary the last thing that ANZ wants is to have to tell you to sell
property therefore it is imperative that PAW endeavour
to lock in the Cargill
cash flow for Kindon."
<P>

406   	Armitage's support of the Group account was further
evidenced in his memorandum to the credit sector of 24 March 1992 in
which he
stated:
<P>

"It is considered imperative that PAW be able to maintain the Coles throughput
and therefore continuation of $1.7 mio sought at
recent CM is integral to that
requirement."
<P>

407   	There followed in that memorandum a number of
observations by Armitage about the Coles contract which I think fairly
reflected
the position as advanced by Wright.  
<P>

408   	In anticipation of obtaining approval for the group's
temporary requirements, Armitage had forwarded to Wright a draft facilities
letter by facsimile of 16 March "<b>For Discussion Purposes</b>".  The draft
provided for an overdraft facility of $3,000,000 reducing to $1,300,000 from 15
April 1992 until the review date of
30 June 1992.  It resulted in the
submission of a letter of offer of 26 March 1992 providing for a total of
$34,510,000 which included
an overdraft facility of $3,000,000 upon terms
requiring its reduction to $1,300,000 on 31 October 1992.  
<P>

409   	Wright's note to the bank in response to that draft is, I
think, significant in the light of the Wrights' evidence of discussions
with
Armitage at that time.  In relation to the proposal of a $1,700,000 temporary
overdraft until 15 April 1992, Wright's note was
"Require extension from
15.4.92 to Friday 1.5.92."  In general comments in the draft, Armitage had
included the following:
<P>

"If the Coles contract is not in place by 15 April 1992 the Bank reserves the
right to alter the above mentioned repayment schedule
ie. the Bank would look
to see over a 3 month period from 30/03/92 a reduction in facilities of up to
$3,000,000." 
<P>

410   	Wright's response was: 
<P>

"Extension from 15.4.92 to 1.5.92 per above
<P>

We presume that the reduction of $3,000,000 referred to is $1,700,000 over and
above the reduction to $1,300,000 referred to in
page 2 amount."
<P>

411   	A further proposed term was as follows:
<P>

"5.	The Customer to produce, by 15/04/92, revised Cash Flow Forecast for 12
months to 30/03/93 reflecting Coles contract/Kindon
operation.
<P>

6.	If Cash Flow Forecast cannot in the Banks opinion substantiate interest
serviceability, the customer agrees to liquidating sufficient
assets
(land/stock) by 30/6/93 to reduce total indebtedness to a level so that
interest serviceability and principal repayments can
be easily demonstrated.
<P>

	Assets that at this stage could be listed for sale are:
<P>

							<u>Directors Valuation</u>
<P>

Woodburn						  2,100,000
<P>

Yarrowyck						  3,800,000
<P>

Achill						  4,500,000
<P>

Forglen						  5,800,000
<P>

Stock on properties					<u>  4,400,000</u>
<P>

							20,600,000
<P>

The customer to advise order of assets to be liquidated should such be
necessary."
<P>

412   	Wright responded in the following terms:
<P>

"We feel that to dispose of the assets listed on page 7 would need to be
carefully marketed rather than simply sold.  We would propose
to sell Yarrowyck
and Woodburn plus associated livestock within the required time frame but would
prefer to have the flexibility
to continue the liquidation programme within the
next 12 months thus avoiding the risk of depressing land values in the Armidale
area through over supply.
<P>

It should be our object to market any real estate at the time of optimal
seasonal conditions."
<P>

413   	In his closing comment, Wright noted that the group had
ceased buying livestock for the Coles pipeline on 6 March 1992 "because
of
working capital restraints, thus creating a dangerous gap in supply of product
in the near future which could seriously jeopardise
(the) Coles relationship".
As considered later in these reasons, I am reasonably satisfied that the bank's
conduct did not cause
any breakdown in supply leading to the loss of the Coles
contract.  
<P>

414   	There followed a facsimile of 23 March 1992 from Armitage
to Wright as follows:
<P>

   "To assist with further progression of your finance extension, the following
will be appreciated
<P>

Current Creditors (As Per List)			$
<P>

<P>

Current OD Balance				<u>$		</u>
<P>

<P>

	Current Group OD Limit				$1,800,000
<P>

	Increase Sought					<u>$1,200,000	</u>
<P>

							$3,000,000	
<P>

    To facilitate recording an appropriate expiry date of facility increase
could you please advise expected reduction programme
through cattle sales.  ie
permanent reduction in facilities 
<P>

    David I would also assume that should Kindon be sold funds would be
utilised in debt reduction.  Also Cargills acquisition of
50% of Esrolem may
also see a reduction in borrowings of $1,500,000.
<P>

    It is also now imperative that the Coles contract be consumated (sic) as
soon as possible.  If no contract is forthcoming will
Coles allow run off of,
pipeline or could they simply stop buying?"
<P>

415   	That note reflected the importance to the bank of the
successful negotiation of a long term contract with Coles.  The bank's
facilities letter of 26 March 1992 provided the required overdraft assistance
of $3,000,000 with reduction by $1,700,000 deferred
until 31 October 1992.
<P>

416   	The Wrights' evidence of their dealings with the bank,
and in particular with Armitage, in the first half of 1992 is difficult
to
reconcile with the records.  It is the evidence of Wright and David Wright that
the terms of the facilities letter of 26 March
1992 unreasonably imposed upon
the group the need to sell some 6,036 females in order to effect the overdraft
reduction to $1,300,000
on 31 October 1992.  Wright's evidence is that on 16
March 1992 he had a telephone conversation with Armitage in which he
remonstrated
with Armitage over the unreasonableness of the proposed terms of
offer which had been sent in draft form by Armitage.  
<P>

417   	He gave evidence of a further telephone conversation with
Armitage on 26 March 1992 after receipt of the letter of offer
of that date in
which he insisted that the debt reduction required by October 1992 was
unreasonable and out of line with the group's
strategy which involved an
increased cashflow from the herd build-up in late 1993.  
<P>

418   	David Wright gave evidence to a similar effect.  It was
his evidence that as a result of the bank's requirement for the reduction
of
the overdraft, he provided the bank with two cashflow budgets on 18 May 1992
which reflected the need to sell some 6,036 females.

<P>

419   	The difficulty I have with the evidence of the Wrights
concerning the terms of the 26 March 1992 letter of offer is that
it is not
reflected in the remarks of Wright in his commentary of 17 March 1992
responding to Armitage's invitation to comment on
the draft letter of offer.
The only comment on the reduction in overdraft was to require an extension of
the time for reduction to
1 May 1992 and there is nothing in the terms of that
commentary to suggest that the proposed reduction would involve a forced sale
of part of the breeding herd.   
<P>

420   	Also, according to the evidence of Wright, upon his
receipt of the letter of offer of 26 March 1992, in a telephone conversation
with Armitage of that day, he challenged the October date for reduction of the
overdraft on the basis that until "the increased cashflow
from the herd buildup
beginning in late 1993 (the Wrights) cannot commit to the debt reduction
required by October 1992".  
<P>

421   	In my view, at that time, a strategy of herd build-up
which had been effected by large scale property and stock purchases
bore little
resemblance to the gradual increase in breeding herd under discussion in June
1988.  What was pertinent to the group's
financial position in March 1992 was
finalising negotiations involving Cargill and Coles.  I have little doubt that
the financial
welfare of the group depended upon the outcome of those
negotiations:  particularly amidst the cost impact of the continuing
drought.
<P>

422   	Further, all of the memoranda of Armitage to the credit
sector in that period reflected a banking officer striving to meet
the needs of
the customer and firmly opposing a strategy that would unreasonably deplete the
group's female herd.
<P>

423   	On 1 April 1992, the position of the group was dealt a
serious blow when Wright was informed by Coles that it was "not prepared
to
proceed further with negotiations for the proposed boxed beef supply
arrangement".  
<P>

424   	In that connection, Coles made the following proposal:
<P>

"We are aware that you have acquired stock anticipating the completion of our
negotiations and that you currently hold approximately
5,000 head of cattle.
In order to ensure that you are not unduly inconvenienced by our decision, we
are prepared to assist you in
clearing these cattle subject to you meeting our
quality and other specifications, over a period of time for Queensland and New
South
Wales stores."
<P>

425   	It is the evidence of David Wright that following this
termination letter, there were discussions with Coles that resulted
in a
facsimile of 10 April 1992 which confirmed a reduction in the price being paid
by Coles for the Esrolem product from $4.75 per
kilogram plus freight to $4.02
per kilogram delivered which involved a "substantial loss ... over the ensuing
period of approximately
three months".  That may, in part, explain the
inability of the group to reduce debt by retiring any part of the facility in
bill
line 3 which had been treated as basic to enable the group to supply beef
to Coles.
<P>

426   	It is difficult to see how the group could expect to
enjoy the continued treatment of the group account as though it consisted
of
basic facilities with the termination of the negotiations by Coles.  The
principal terminating lines had been converted to basic
on the strength of the
Coles one year contract and an anticipated long term arrangement with Coles.
The Deloitte report clearly put
in question the group's viability in the event
that the Coles supply arrangement fell down.  With the group's long term
viability
under a cloud with the termination of negotiations by Coles, there is
little or no room for criticising conduct of the bank aimed
at reduction of
debt, if necessary by a sale of some of the group's properties and
livestock.
<P>

427   	There was a meeting in Armidale on 5 May 1992 attended by
Wright, Phillip Wright, Hudson, Nicholls, Robertson, Vaughan and
Armitage which
considered the effect of the Coles rundown.  The diary note of that date
reflected the loss of confidence in the account.
 Under the heading
"<b>Cashflows</b>" there appeared the following:
<P>

"As a result of the above dynamic changes a new cashflow for the 12 month
period to June 1993 has not been prepared.
<P>

We have requested a 6 week cashflow detailing the run off of the Coles contract
ie. we expect facilities to reduce by approx $3m.
 This is to be available
prior to 15/05/92.
<P>

PAWS were also requested to begin urgent work on a 12 month budget for the
Pastoral operation which could later be overlaid by any
deal struck with
Cargill."
<P>

428   	The Wrights gave detailed evidence of this meeting.  In
the case of David Wright, in his affidavit sworn 14 November 1996,
he said that
he attended the meeting at which were present Wright, Phillip Wright, Nicholls,
Robertson, Hudson and, he thought, Vaughan.
 He gave detailed evidence of the
discussion between Armitage and Wright.  However, in his later evidence, he
recalled that he had
not attended that meeting and that he had received a
conference telephone call from Armidale in which he participated that day. 

<P>

429   	I think it is reasonably clear from the evidence of
Armitage that he had little recollection of the detail of that meeting
beyond
the bank's diary record.  In the absence of contemporaneous records of the
Wrights, I think the detail of the evidence given
by them of this meeting
should not be taken literally.  According to Wright, at that meeting he
informed Armitage that it would be
impossible to effect the reduction in the
overdraft in the face of the Coles development and that debt reduction would
involve the
sale of breeding cows.  Armitage's response, he said, was that the
bank was "absolutely determined" to have the debt reduction agreed
upon,
whether that meant the sale of breeding herd or not, and required the
submission of cashflows to demonstrate the sales required
to meet the debt
reduction in October 1992.  Armitage, while having no recollection of the
detail of discussion, denied any specific
discussion of the sale of the group's
breeding herd.  
<P>

430   	Robertson, Nicholls and Hudson all corroborate the fact
that at this meeting, Armitage had insisted on debt reduction, notwithstanding
the remonstrations of the Wrights that it would involve the sale of females.  I
have had no occasion to doubt the veracity of those
witnesses. 
<P>

431   	Given the admitted absence of recollection of this
discussion by Armitage, I accept that the bank did require the submission
of a
cashflow that supported the required debt reduction and that Armitage
acknowledged that if that involved the sale of part of
the breeding herd, then
that was the inevitable consequence of the need of the group to comply with the
terms of the facilities provided
by the bank.  In the face of the considerable
change in the group's anticipated cashflow which the loss of the Coles long
term contract
represented and Wright's statements that the October reduction in
overdraft would not be met, I would not regard the bank's insistence
upon
recourse to livestock sales, if necessary to enable the group to meet its
obligations to the bank, as unreasonable:  particularly
if one bears in mind
that the group's cattle livestock count in April 1992 was in the order of
36,500 head, of which approximately
21,500 were females.
<P>

432   	David Wright has identified the cashflow projections
submitted to the bank at Armitage's insistence as being those dated
variously
14 and 15 May 1992.  The cashflow comprised some 62 pages.  It disclosed sale
of the cattle for the period to December
1992.  However, it did not, in my
view, identify any breeding herd earmarked for sale.  It does not follow that
females forecast
for sales were part of any breeding herd numbers or
requirements.  The schedules contained forecasts for "normal season" and for
"drought case".
<P>

433   	The facsimile of Hudson to Armitage of 15 May 1992
accompanying those projections made no comment about the involvement of
the
breeding herd in the proposed sale of cattle and simply noted that Nicholls
would "`walk' (Armitage) through the two projection
sets ... and (would)
outline the various assumptions .. made".  That was followed by a facsimile of
Hudson to Armitage of 18 May
1992 enclosing a note "covering some of the
assumptions used in the forecasts" for the purpose of the meeting referred to
in the
earlier facsimile.  So far as is relevant, that note contained the
following:
<P>

"Some brief notes on the Cash Flow Forecasts.
<P>

1)	Nine weeks to June 26, 1992.
<P>

Receipts and payments are same under both scenarios with exception of early
receipts from sales of stock from N.E. Properties in
event of drought.
<P>

Both forecasts reflect close-down of Boning Room on cessation of Coles business
and outflow of termination payments approx $211,000
last week in June.
<P>

Payout of lease residual on sausage filler included as Capex in w/e 3 July.
<P>

2)	Six months ending December, 1992
<P>

Receipts and payments; comments same as above.
<P>

Both forecasts reflect remainder of cash inflow from Coles following closure of
Boning Room plus hides and fat &amp; bone $372,000,
as well as proceeds of
remainder of 'out of spec' feedlot stock $241,000.  Also, proceeds from sale of
surplus vehicles $23,000.
 Esrolem expenses represent payout of creditors
including feedlots.  Payout of residual on lease of panel van and on-going
lease
payments for 1 vehicle, conveyors and Computer systems for Boning
Room.
<P>

No costs, or income have been included for any Cargill business which may
eventuate in Brisbane, nor, any income from the existing
Cargill agistment
activity which is being managed by John Weston." 
<P>

434   	This strengthens my strong view that in evaluating the
evidence in this matter dealing with the details of discussions at
the numerous
meetings between the parties, it is preferable to distinguish between the
substance and the detail and to realise that
there may not have been the same
emphasis placed upon particular matters as the detailed evidence could now
convey.  I am satisfied
that Armitage was not indifferent to the
shortsightedness of requiring sale of part of the breeding herd that would
produce temporary
relief but impact adversely on later cashflows.
<P>

435   	In any event, a glance at the stock figures throughout
the remainder of 1992 does not suggest a blind sacrifice of the group's
breeding herd.  Although cattle numbers had dropped significantly from
approximately 34,000 in May to 25,000 in December (back to
29,000 in January
1993), the drop in the female numbers was only 3,900 (all approximate figures).
Part of that female decline was
represented by some 2,700 cows, some of whom,
presumably, would be CFA cows.  By year's end the properties were in the grip
of bad
drought conditions and figures of that kind, in my view, are not
particularly surprising.
<P>

436   	The Coles set back did not extinguish Wright's pursuit of
joint venture proposals to Smorgons.  On 17 June 1992, PAWS submitted
a
"Presentation" to Smorgons, described as a "strategic alliance" between the two
entities.  The proposal involved the acquisition
of six Queensland and Northern
Territory properties running some 85,000 head, at that time in the hands of the
Angliss group.  It
excluded from consideration three "Rockhampton properties".
It envisaged an acquisition cost of approximately $52,000,000.
<P>

437   	At about that time, the group's credibility in the eyes
of the bank was under considerable pressure.  That was reflected
in Vaughan's
facsimile to Wright of 10 June 1992 concerning an appointed meeting of 16 June
1992.  It included the following comments
on the "Coles rundown":
<P>

"Back in April/May 1990 some $5M was advanced to PAWS for additional cattle
purchases to assist with backgrounding of cattle on
Boonaldoon.
<P>

The agreement was for these funds to be repaid in November 1990.  At this time
repayment was deferred due to the start up of the
Esrolem/Coles supply
arrangement.  It was our understanding that these cattle would be part of the
Coles pipeline and that if the
Coles contract was ever terminated then the
rundown would be sufficient to generate the $4M repayment deferred from
November 1990.
<P>

It would appear from the cashflow provided that the run down in debt will not
be close to the $4M.  In fact on the normal seasons
cashflow the run off of
debt to 30 June 1992 is approx. nil from 30 March 1992."
<P>

438   	As I understand it, there had been several thousand
cattle in the Coles pipeline in 1992, so I think this comment had some
point.
The main problem seems to have been that sale of beef to Coles was being made
at a loss and sale on the open market was at
greatly depressed prices,
reflecting the effect of the drought.  The sale of the cattle dedicated to the
Coles supply, in better
times, should have permitted the Wrights, to retire at
least part of the $5,000,000 facility raised in 1990.  Originally, the facility
was provided as a temporary facility to fund an opportunistic purchase of
steers.  It was then converted into a basic facility to
service the supply of
cattle to Coles. 
<P>

439   	It appears that the proposed meeting between the Wrights
and the bank did not take place until later in June, either on 22
or 26 June.
It was held in Armidale and was attended by Wright, Phillip and David Wright,
Nicholls, Hudson, Robertson, Vaughan and
Armitage.  According to the evidence
of the Wrights, and in this respect they are supported by the evidence of
Hudson and Robertson,
David Wright took the opportunity to complain of the
forced sale of breeding herd and the adverse consequences to the long term
viability
of the group.  I think it is clear from the evidence of Armitage that
he has no independent recollection of that meeting beyond his
diary note.  That
note contained the following statement:  
<P>

"PAWS because of sound management practice have not compromised their livestock
production through a sell off of the breeding herd.
 This concept has since
been confirmed by Rick Wright and Peter McKeon of Chapman &amp; Eastway.
<P>

...
<P>

Optimum breeding herd size has now reduced from 25,000 to 19,500 head.  The
implication is that cashflow will be boosted one year
earlier (ie. 1993 rather
than 1994) because herd is at this level now.
<P>

By holding steers rather than increasing the breeding herd cashflow benefits
from the faster turnover.
<P>

...
<P>

Despite the fact PAWS have no firm cattle disposal arrangements in place at the
moment they have no intention of selling their cattle
through the open market
auction system.   To reduce costs and maximise value PAWS will in the future
sell stock by private treaty.
 They feel that to sell by any other means puts
them at risk to market forces which at the moment are depressed.  PAWS believe
because
of their large stock numbers they have the economies of scale, quality
of cattle and management/admin ability to make such a system
work."
<P>

440   	In referring to cashflow assumptions, the diary note was
to the following effect:
<P>

"Livestock sales are well spread.  The majority of the budgeted sales to March
1993 ($2.4m) were originally scheduled for late 1992
but due to seasonal
conditions have been pushed back.  October and November sales are budgeted to
aggregate $4.461m.  Significantly
higher cattle numbers available for sale
highlights the decision to hold the breeding herd at 19,500 head rather than
retain all
female stock to build up the numbers to 25,000."
<P>

441   	Quite clearly the meeting discussed the sale of female
cattle, some of which could have been retained to build-up the breeding
herd.
In the light of the facsimile communications of Hudson in May concerning
projected sales, I would not place too much emphasis
on the detail of this
meeting as evidenced by the Wrights, beyond accepting that the sale of cattle
under distressed market conditions
involved the sale of breeders. 
<P>

442   	The sale of property to effect a reduction of debt had
been a subject of discussion with the Wrights as earlier noted in
these reasons
and, at that time, it was in contemplation that Yarrowyck and Woodburn would be
suitable properties for sale.  However,
in 1992, the spotlight fell on Kindon.
The possible disposal of Kindon was built into budgets provided by the Wrights
to the bank
in June of 1992 and was the subject of a memorandum of Armitage to
Wright of 17 July 1992 which was in the following terms:
<P>

"-	Cashflow is dependent to a major degree on the sale of Kindon Station
(included in the budget to occur October 1992).  We understand
that no
arrangements for this sale are yet in place and therefore have severe doubts
that this forecast is achievable.
<P>

-	If Kindon is not sold PAW will require increased Bank assistance in December
1992 and January 1993.
<P>

-	Cashflow is based on a yet to be tested sales program of selling by private
treaty.
<P>

-	If continuation of severe seasonal conditions occurs this would seriously
adversely affect budgeted sales programming and income.
 Only minimum allowance
for this has been taken into account.
<P>

-	Sales programs forecast for calendar 1993 through to 1996 does not appear
sufficient to ensure interest serviceability when you
consider interest costs
are likely to approximate $3.0m (if Kindon is not sold) and property expenses
approx. $3.0m (includes fertilizer
expense)."
<P>

443   	September 1992 is a significant point in the
consideration of the conduct of the bank in relation to the orderly
rationalisation
of the group's activities.  In that month Rodricks submitted a
memorandum to the regional executive of business banking dated 4 September
1992.  The general tenor of the credit sector's memorandum was the seeking of
"the maximum reduction in ... debt from the sale of
assets, including `Kindon'
...".  The memorandum set out requirements for the granting of continued
financial assistance to the Wrights.
 
<P>

444   	Armitage's response to this was as follows:
<P>

"Overall, everyone agrees that PAWS's total gearing position is unsatisfactory
and must be reduced.  Given the current drought situation,
sale of additional
livestock will not provide sufficient breathing space in the short term without
impacting upon future serviceability.
 Accordingly, sale of Kindon/other assets
to reduce gearing should be pursued but within an orderly disposal time frame
so that returns
can be maximised."
<P>

445   	Armitage's diary note concluded with the following
"overview":
<P>

"It is obvious that the <u>short term poor outlook</u> for PAW does not sit
comfortably within the Bank and the restrictions to be imposed on the client
are a round about way of saying
that we do not want their business.
Accordingly account executive will actively pursue the termination of this
relationship."
<P>

446   	The approach adopted by Armitage was to submit a letter
to Wright of 11 September 1992 which set out the revised terms and
conditions
upon which the bank was prepared to provide facilities to the group.  Those
terms and conditions were introduced with
the comment that "[t]he revised
requirements of the Bank are likely to have a substantial impact on (the)
group's operations and
accordingly it is requested that you arrange to meet
with Mr. Buckley and (Armitage) at (the bank's) offices to discuss the contents
... at (Wright's) earliest convenience".
<P>

447   	The total facility offered was $34,510,000, which
included an overdraft of $3,000,000 reducing to $2,000,000 on 31 October
1992
as to which it was noted that "additional cattle sales will be required to
maintain account balance within limit availability".
 It was noted further that
excesses would "not be allowed and cheques (would) be dishonoured to control
the account".
<P>

448   	Among the conditions sought to be imposed was the
requirement that Kindon was to be sold, with a reservation of the right
of the
bank to implement a sale by auction after 31 December 1992 if the bank was not
satisfied with progress towards sale.  The
bank foreshadowed the need for a
principal debt reduction of $2,000,000 per annum from either trading or asset
divestment.  It nominated
Woodburn, Yarrowyck, Achill and Forglen as
appropriate properties to be sold along with stock holdings on those
properties.  Deferred
cattle sales of November/December 1991 were to be
effected by 31 October 1992.  A minimum security cover of 60% of market value
was
stipulated.  
<P>

449   	The requested meeting with Buckley and Armitage took
place on 25 September 1992 in the bank's office.  It was attended by
Wright,
David Wright, Robertson, Buckley, Armitage and Brian Davis (Davis), a manager
in business banking.  The diary note of that
meeting took the form of itemising
the various conditions in the bank's letter of 11 September and noted the
result of the meeting
in relation to each such item.
<P>

450   	In relation to the condition concerning the sale of
Kindon, it was noted that Wright objected to the manner of sale proposed
and
outlined an alternative offering by private negotiation which the bank
considered to be "practical and acceptable".  As to the
foreshadowed need to
dispose of assets to meet a yearly debt reduction of $2,000,000, the diary note
recorded an acceptance of this
condition by Wright with a proviso related to
the group's ability to revive the arrangement with Coles.  
<P>

451   	Of particular interest is the record of the requirement
to achieve "deferred cattle sales" by 31 October 1992.  The diary
note recorded
Wright as explaining that the deferment had been the result of the drought and
had nothing to do with the possibility
of resuming supplies to Coles and that
the cattle were at feedlots simply to improve quality prior to sale.  
<P>

452   	Armitage recorded that the bank agreed "to sale of cattle
in terms of cashflow presented at (the) last meeting ie. sale of
cattle by
06/11/92, subject overall to the confines of limit availability".  That record
is difficult to reconcile with the evidence
of that meeting by the group's
witnesses.  The diary note also recorded the presentation by the Wrights of a
cashflow forecast for
the period from October 1992 to December 1993 which
revealed that the group would not be able to operate within the bank's
arrangement
until April 1993 due mainly to the "continuation of the drought".
On that basis, Wright sought extension of facilities until April
1993.  
<P>

453   	The bank's response, as recorded, was that they would
"revert back early next week with (the) answer".  Wright's evidence
of this
meeting is in extraordinary detail and extends over some seven pages of his
first statement of evidence and consists almost
entirely of the details of the
discussion that took place.  Again, I think the only way that evidence should
be approached is by
not taking it literally but extracting the substance of the
material evidenced.  In that respect, the evidence of Wright is consistent
with
the diary record of the discussion concerning the sale of Kindon by private
negotiation.  He also evidenced the discussion of
the position of the cattle on
feedlots in southern Queensland and I think that is consistent with the diary
note of Armitage, particularly
in relation to the fact that the cattle were not
related to a possible resumption of supply to Coles and were there simply to
improve
their condition for sale.  
<P>

454   	Wright confirmed that Armitage agreed that "the cattle be
sold in line with the cashflow discussed in the last meeting that
is by the 6
November".  The outcome of the meeting was the subject of confirmation by
Armitage and Buckley in their jointly signed
letter to Wright of 30 September
1992 which was in terms similar to the contents of the diary note of Armitage.
In particular, in
relation to the proposed sale of cattle it was stated as
follows:
<P>

"You have since clarified that the deferment of cattle sales has resulted from
necessity due to drought conditions not for the purpose
of the Coles
venture.
<P>

Now that these cattle are at feedlots to improve quality of beasts prior to
sale, no further extensions should be encountered. 
The bank is agreeable to
sale of cattle in terms of cashflow presented at our last meeting ie. sale of
cattle by 06/11/92, subject
overall to the confines of limit availability."
<P>

455   	The response of Wright of 1 October 1992 in his letter to
Armitage sought further deferment of the sale of cattle until 31
December 1992
on the basis that the cattle, which he identified as some 2,500 yearlings and
300 bulls, were not ready for the market,
being drought affected and females
had only just commenced calving.  He estimated that the cost detriment of
adherence to the November
timetable was approximately $340,000.
<P>

456   	The bank's accommodation letter of 7 October 1992 to
Wright rejected this approach and if that attitude had persisted, it
would be
difficult to justify on grounds of reasonableness, as the considerations
presented in Wright's letter of 1 October 1992,
I think, were compelling.
However, the bank's position altered, following a meeting at the request of
Wright, with Fotheringham and
Brennan in Sydney on 9 October 1992. 
<P>

457   	Wright said that he took the opportunity at that meeting
to emphasise the "excellent" relations with Punch and Armitage in
the handling
of the group's account, and to criticise the pressure being imposed on credit
facilities which was likely to involve
a forced sale of "10,000 head of drought
affected cattle".  Wright said that he brought up the fact that the bank's
requirements
were "completely contrary to the assurances given (to the Wrights)
by (the) Bank when (the Wrights) proposed (their) long term 10
year programme
...".  
<P>

458   	Wright also said that he informed Fotheringham that the
Wrights had been informed by the bank that they "would not have to
repay
borrowings other than from cashflow during this 10 years", referring to the
long term program of the group.  Fotheringham did
not accept that those
statements were made at the meeting, basing his evidence on the terms of the
diary note of that meeting which
he signed and which contained no such
references.  However, I treat that inconsistency in their recollections as
attributable to
the different emphases placed upon those matters at the time as
distinct from the emphasis placed upon them in the detailed evidence
of the
Wrights.  I accept that it did not register with Fotheringham that the bank had
assured the Wrights that repayments of principal
or interest would only be
geared to available cashflow.  As earlier noted, however, it was clear in the
bank's own records and the
terms of facility offers that some repayment terms
were expressly related to the group's cashflow.  
<P>

459   	One matter referred to in an expert's report in evidence
in the group's case may call for special comment.  The report purported
to link
the changed attitude of the bank to the group's account with the pressure of
bad debts on the bank arising out of the them
prevailing recession.  I am
satisfied that there was no such link with the bank's treatment of the group
account.  That was the effect
of the evidence of Brennan.  At the same time I
would not require much convincing that the stringent economic times, in which
the
Australian economy was faltering, would have heightened the understanding
within the bank of the need to maintain a careful supervision
of its customer
accounts.  
<P>

460   	There followed a letter from Fotheringham to Wright of 21
October 1992 which, in relation to "Cattle Sales to Maintain Cash
Flow", stated
as follows:
<P>

"The Bank is prepared to allow P A Wright &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (PAW) sufficient
time to dispose of livestock in an orderly manner.
 This decision is based upon
cash flows presented being maintained and an overview thereof being undertaken
by independent accountants.
 Until the latter is received by the Bank, cheques
will need to be presented to the Bank for approval prior to their release.
Further
discussion will be required in light of the review of cash flows to
ensure the proper facilities are in place, or alternatively,
adjustments made
to the cash flows themselves."
<P>

461   	Fotheringham summarised the position as follows:
<P>

"In summary, the Bank's concerns over P A Wright &amp; Sons Pty Ltd Group level
of debt are again emphasised and your commitment
to achieve the proposed
reduction will be required.  Additionally, pending the outcome of the
independent accountant's overview of
cash flows and account operations
returning within agreed facilities, the Bank's prior approval will be required
to enable release
of the Company's paper.
<P>

There is obviously a need to continue discussions regarding the future cash
flows and asset sales, but I trust that you understand
the reasons for our
concerns and the urgent need for the Group's financial position to return to
more prudent levels." 
<P>

462   	I think it is difficult to criticise that general
approach as expressed by Fotheringham on behalf of the bank.  In theory,
at
this time it would have been possible for the Wrights to withdraw from the
expansion program undertaken in the previous two years.
 However, by mid 1992
the debt level was approximately $34,500,000 and had been at that level, or
thereabouts, for nearly 12 months.
 That included $5,000,000 temporary finance
for an opportunistic purchase of steers that had been turned into a revolving
facility
to enable the subject cattle to be used in the supply of beef to
Coles.  That purpose no longer endured.
<P>

463   	As I understand the financials of the group, the benefit
of that $5,000,000 to the group had been lost and, in addition,
there had been
an increase in debt from approximately $30,600,000, following the acquisition
of Boonaldoon and Thornleigh and the
additional livestock as at January 1991,
to an indebtedness of approximately $34,500,000 in mid 1992, which does not
appear to have
been reflected in any improvement in shareholders funds in the
group.  
<P>

464   	In my view, that deterioration in the financial position
of the group should not be laid at the door of the bank.  As frequently
referred to in these reasons, the operation was badly affected by a persisting
severe drought which also had the effect of depressing
market value of
properties and commodity prices of livestock.  I think from those factors alone
it was inevitable that disposal of
assets to reduce debt would not place the
group back in the position it had enjoyed prior to embarking upon the expansion
strategy
in 1990.  
<P>

465   	That poses the question whether the bank's requirement
for the disposal of assets, as that requirement emerged during 1992,
could be
said to have been consistent with the provision of facilities as "basic" in
January 1991.  In that context, any obligation
of the bank to provide short
term accommodation to meet the vicissitudes of the drought could not be
open-ended, nor could it be
required to defer reduction of debt by disposal of
assets until the effect of the drought had passed.  Particularly is that so
once
the Coles arrangement failed.  So much of the bank's support had been
promoted on the back of the outstanding potential benefit to
the group of the
Coles contract.  I am satisfied that the bank's willingness to convert the
$5,000,000 facilities to a revolving
loan and to convert the principle
indebtedness from terminating to basic in January 1991 was the result of the
bank's acceptance
of Wright's judgment that the Coles contract represented
considerable financial benefits to the group.
<P>

466   	Giving full expression to the obligations of the bank,
which I think flowed from the special relationship that had existed
between it
and its customer and to the terms of the facilities in place on 2 January 1991,
it is my firm view that the manner in
which the bank addressed the need to
dispose of assets during 1992 was reasonable and consistent with the facility
letter of 2 January
1991.
<P>

467   	In line with Fotheringham's letter of 21 October 1992,
the bank maintained considerable financial pressure upon the group
through the
introduction of what was described as a "50/50" arrangement whereby, for every
one dollar of income, PAWS was required
to apply fifty cents in reduction of
debt and fifty cents towards payment of "essential creditors", and meeting
operating expenditure.
 In practical terms that put the group on a hand to
mouth basis and gave rise to crisis situations, particularly towards the end
of
the calendar year, in satisfying trade creditors.  
<P>

468   	Further, while the credit memoranda of the bank noted the
safety of the lending, it is simplistic, in my view, to treat the
continuation
of that feature of the bank's lending as carrying the corollary that the bank
remained under obligation to maintain
or increase facilities as long as it held
sufficient security.
<P>

469   	For the purpose of obtaining an independent accountant's
overiew, Jeffrey James (James), a partner of Ernst &amp; Young,
was retained,
by letter of the bank of 26 October 1992.  James was to provide an analysis of
the group's cashflow budgets with the
view to reporting on the achievability of
the budgets for the purpose of enabling the bank to "implement appropriate
financial strategies
with PAW to ensure the group is able to continue with its
planned strategies but at levels of gearing that PAW can sustain given
the
vagaries of a pastoral operation".  Those comments of Armitage, in my view, are
not exceptionable.  
<P>

470   	In November, while the James investigation was underway,
there were three bank records which I think call for comment.  The
first is a
report from Armitage to the credit department of 24 November 1992 which
reflected the tight credit position the group
was forced to operate under with
trade creditors and other "accounts payable" amounting to approximately
$735,000, which, under the
50/50 arrangement, could not be paid out in full.
Of particular note, I think, is the following comment:
<P>

"Customer will (if necessary) commence selling part of his breeding herd but
this was not considered an option based on long term
impact on Customer and
subsequently led to Ernst &amp; Young being appointed to provide an independent
assessment of the total position.
<P>

NB.  Customer meeting with State Manager Business Banking (09/10/92) also
supported that "we did not wish to force excessive sale
of cattle which involve
decimation of their breeding herd"."
<P>

471   	The report was favourable to the Wrights in their
endeavour to meet the bank's requirements and recommended a relaxation
of the
50/50 arrangement pending receipt of the James report to allow payment of trade
creditors.  An indication of the hard-headedness
of credit was the refusal to
accede to that request and that was conveyed by Armitage in his letter to
Wright of 25 November 1992.
 
<P>

472   	The reasoning for this attitude is set out in the credit
department's memorandum of 25 November 1992.  It noted that, of
the $735,000
trade debts, there would remain outstanding approximately $100,000 after
approved payments had been made, and that planned
sales of livestock by the
group would soon attend to that indebtedness.  The regional credit executive
responsible for the memorandum
made it clear that "it (was) not (his) intention
to force sale of breeding herds, surplus property sales must take precedent,
but
these people must get on with it".
<P>

473   	In a further letter by Armitage to Wright of 27 November
1992, while adhering to his instructions, Armitage added a note
that "[s]hould
there be an urgent payment required to pay creditor(s) which may create
irreparable damage to ongoing trade transactions,
please advise full details to
this office for consideration on a case by case basis".  The letter ended with
an invitation to contact
the bank by phone.  
<P>

474   	The year ended with the group being left in a liquidity
crisis following a meeting of 8 December 1992 attended by Wright,
Nicholls,
Hudson, Armitage, Vaughan, Davis and, for a short time, Robertson.
<P>

475   	In order to alleviate this problem, Armitage suggested
converting the commercial bills to fully drawn advances which would
have the
effect of interest being paid in arrears rather than in advance.  Such a
facility was put in place on 19 January 1993. 

<P>

476   	The thrust of James' report of 27 January 1993 (the James
report) was a recommendation for the partial disposal of the group's
rural
holdings to reduce what James regarded as the unacceptably high level of the
group's debt and to enable the group to trade
in a way sufficient to service
its debt.  
<P>

477   	The history of the relationship between the group and the
bank, following that report until the termination of the facilities
in February
1996, is one of the bank pursuing that course with, I think, the co-operation
of the group. 
<P>

478   	The first sale of property did not take place until March
1994 with the exchange of contracts for Kindon, a transaction in
which the
other branch of the Wright family participated.  The only other divestment of
property prior to the parting of ways between
the group and the bank was the
sale of the coastal block at South West Rocks in May 1995.  Throughout that
time, in varying degrees,
the group's properties, livestock and the market
place continued to suffer from the debilitating effect of drought.  Ironically,
at the end of 1995 when Boonaldoon was on the market, inspections of the
property by possible purchasers were prevented by heavy
rain in the
district.
<P>

479   	The critical aspect of the James report, in my view, was
the conclusion reached by James that "the likely PAWS profitability
and cash
flow forecasts ... does not allow it to service current debt from operations in
a conservative environment or in the event
of drought (and that) PAWS
management, to an extent, recognise this fact as their cash flow budgets take
account of the need to sell
certain properties in order to reduce the group's
level of debt, namely the proposed sale of Boonaldoon, Woodburn, Yarrowyck and
Forglen ...".
<P>

480   	He further expressed the view that the PAWS cashflow
model was 
<P>

"<u>not</u> conservative and leaves no room for flexibility.  The main risk
factors being:- 
<P>

			&#183;	season - effect on livestock numbers 
<P>

		
<P>

			&#183;	cattle prices 
<P>

	
<P>

			&#183;	interest rates"
<P>

481   	In section 2.7 of the report the further opinion was
expressed as follows:
<P>

"To obtain an acceptable level of gearing to ensure continued viability of the
PAWS group it will be necessary to sell either Kindon
or Paradise, or possibly
both in addition to properties already proposed in the PAWS forecast."
<P>

482   	The contents of Annexure 3 to the James report should not
be overlooked in any consideration of the dispute between the parties
over
quantum issues relating to the state of the properties and the management
practices of the group.  Annexure 3 consisted of a
report of 19 November 1992
by NV McMichael (McMichael), an agricultural consultant retained by James to
report on the group's properties.
 He inspected Achill, Forglen, Conningdale,
Thorpleigh, Wallamumbi, Glenview, Boonaldoon, Kindon, Yarrowyck, Paradise and
Woodburn.
 
<P>

483   	In McMichael's overview, which he said was assisted by
the "full co-operation" of the Wrights and the group's managerial
staff, he
expressed opinions which were highly complimentary of the state of the
properties and the management skills employed. 
He referred to the state of
individual properties as "excellent", "very well managed", with "structural
assets ... in good to excellent
condition", fixtures "good", pastures
"principally improved" and the "[r]esults of aerial sowing on all properties
(being) outstanding'.
 One could understand the Wrights being well pleased with
McMichael's view of the state of the properties.  I think his views stand
in
surprising contrast with the criticism mounted in the bank's case of the
management shortcomings of the group and which were said
to have resulted in
the serious deterioration of the group's properties.
<P>

484   	There was no suggestion that the security position
endangered the bank's lending at that time.  However, in my view, that
report
alone would have provided sufficient basis for the bank to withdraw provision
of basic facilities at the review date and to
pursue a strategy of debt
reduction with the group.  
<P>

485   	I think the foregoing cast a spotlight on that aspect of
the group's case which contended that the conduct of the bank in
the second
half of 1991 and in 1992 had the effect of depriving the group of the
opportunity of establishing a stable, long term
and profitable supply
arrangement with Coles.  If that contention is not made good, then I see little
merit in the criticism leveled
at the bank in respect of its conduct between
1993 and 1996, for, without the benefit of the Coles contract, and fortified by
the
views expressed in the James report, the bank was entitled to act upon the
basis that the group's enterprise was not viable in the
long term without
reduction of debt by sale of properties.  
<P>

486   	In that respect, I think, from a legal standpoint, the
long relationship that had existed between the Wrights and the bank
had no
place of significance.  Nor do I think that the group could reasonably require
the bank to provide open-ended facilities for
working capital as required to
face the challenge of the continuing effect of adverse seasonal and market
conditions which were imposing
severe cost burdens upon the enterprise. 
<P>

487   	Where I think the group's case flounders is in the
failure to prove that its inability to conclude a long term supply arrangement
with Coles, either alone, or in joint venture with Cargill, was due to
unreasonable or unjustified conduct by the bank in the treatment
of the group's
facilities.  
<P>

488   	The group's case is that the June 1991 clamp down and
subsequent credit restrictions imposed by the bank created impossible
trading
conditions for the group on its dealings with Coles; that it caused gaps in the
supply of boxed beef to Coles; that, by insisting
upon the group's
participation in the independent investigation by Deloitte, the bank denied the
group the time required for the
successful completion of the negotiations with
Coles for a long term supply contract; that but for that conduct, such a
contract
would have been successfully negotiated prior to the departure
overseas in February 1992 of Noel Anthony Trinder (Trinder), the group
general
manager of merchandise and marketing of Coles Supermarkets in Australia, who
favoured such an arrangement;  that as a result
of the bank's insistence in
February 1992 that Wright seek an increase in the price of boxed beef to Coles
under the holding over
arrangement, then current negotiations with Coles were
irreparably damaged; that notwithstanding unresolved differences over the
proposed terms of the Coles long term contract, none of those differences would
have precluded agreement being reached between Coles
and the group. 
<P>

489   	I accept that negotiations between Coles and the group
were not assisted by the group's distraction from those negotiations
in
attending to the requirements of Skinner for the purpose of the Deloitte
report.  I am also prepared to accept that the requested
increase in price of
the supply of boxed beef made by the group in February 1992 would not have been
a positive factor in negotiations.
 Further, I accept that differences between
the solicitors for the group and Coles over the terms of the draft supply
agreement under
consideration in the first quarter of 1992 would have been
capable of resolution had Coles, in principle, been prepared to enter
into a
supply agreement with the group.  I am also satisfied that the group had
something of an ally within Coles in Trinder who
favoured pursuing negotiations
with the group for the supply of boxed beef to Coles.  
<P>

490   	The conclusion I have reached, however, is that none of
the matters relied upon in the group's case had any measurable causative
effect
on the ultimate breakdown of the negotiations.  In my view, that breakdown was
due to resistance to the group's proposal by
influential elements within the
Coles organisation, based upon the cost efficiency of the proposal in
comparison with the alternative
of carcass supply of beef.  There is no doubt
that Coles was interested in the concept of the supply of its requirements in
boxed
beef form.  However, I am satisfied that there remained an obstinate
element within Coles who refused to accept that the group's
proposal was cost
effective when compared with the cost of supply of carcass beef. 
<P>

491   	I am also satisfied that the bank was entitled, in the
circumstances prevailing in the second half of 1991, to seek comfort
in
relation to the group account by calling for a report of an independent
accountant.  To the extent that co-operation with that
accountant by the
Wrights in the preparation of that report distracted them temporarily from
negotiations with Coles, that was not
a matter in respect of which the bank
should be called to account.
<P>

492   	That is not to say that I have been unable to accept the
evidence of the Wrights as to their perception of the effect of
the conduct of
the bank upon those negotiations, or as to the basis of those views, so far as
they depended upon statements made
to them from time to time by Trinder.  
<P>

493   	I am satisfied that, in his dealings with the Wrights,
Trinder gave them reason to be optimistic about their prospects of
gaining the
long term supply contract sought from Coles.  However, I think the evidence
plainly showed that there was an influential
rumbling within Coles which was
never muted as to the adverse cost impact of the group's proposition.  
<P>

494   	Moreover, the group's cause was not assisted by
industrial resistance on the basis that the supply of boxed beef was perceived
to threaten the employment of workers engaged in the butchering of carcasses
under the standing beef supply conditions.
<P>

495   	It may have been the case that Trinder led the Wrights to
believe that the failure of the negotiations was due to the group's
delay in
submitting proposals to Coles in 1991, to the price increase triggered by the
group in 1992, or to the revelation that the
group had lost the support of the
bank.  The evidence did not establish that the breakdown was due to any of
those matters.  
<P>

496   	I think it is correct to say that contemporaneous records
were all one way in evidencing the basis for the breakdown of the
negotiations
as resting in the failure of the Wrights to satisfy Coles that their proposal
had substantial cost benefits when compared
with the supply of beef in carcass
form. 
<P>

497   	Consistently with that finding, I am satisfied that there
were, in fact, considerable merits in the supply of boxed beef
to Coles as
evidenced by the fact that, in later times, Coles resorted to the purchase of
beef in that form, although under significantly
different conditions from those
envisaged in the group's proposal.  
<P>

498   	Trinder gave evidence in the group's case and, so far as
I was able to evaluate his evidence from his demeanour in the witness
box,
there was nothing which would occasion me to doubt his veracity  There were
areas, however, where his reliability was in question.
 I was not satisfied
with the reliability of his evidence that there were gaps in supply of boxed
beef by the group which caused
concern within Coles. 
<P>

499   	In Trinder's oral evidence-in-chief, he was invited to
elaborate upon a telephone conversation he had with David Wright "about
mid
February 1992" as follows:
<P>

"Q.   If I could ask you to go to page 19 of your statement.  Down the bottom,
you make reference to a conversation between yourself
and Mr Wright Junior to
potential supply gaps looming or supply gaps looming; did that ever occur?
      
<P>

A.   Yes, it did.                                                
<P>

Q.   Can you tell us when?                              
<P>

A.   This concern about the supply gaps, this happened about March in terms of
the price increase.                           
<P>

Q.   So March when?                                             
<P>

A.   March 1992.                                                
<P>

Q.   You might not be able to but can you give us an idea about the supply gaps
that did occur?                           
<P>

A.   Once again the supply gaps began in around about August.   
<P>

Q.   August 1991?                                               
<P>

A.   1991, yes.  Then when we finally agreed on the price and the price was
reduced, I think, in January of 1992, all right, at
the $4.25 mark.  There were
some concerns about some supply gaps before I left, I think, for the States,
which was late February
1992."
<P>

(T588.5-27.)
<P>

500   	In my view, that evidence is without substance.  It is
not supported by contemporaneous records, nor by the evidence of other
Coles'
representatives, nor by the evidence of David Wright who was recalled
immediately after Trinder gave evidence.  David Wright
was questioned about the
cost impact on the group of the bank's requirement for the reduction of
facilities by $2,000,000 at mid
1991.  He explained the effect as follows:
<P>

"But, anyway, this question of the bank's requirement for us <u>to reduce the
$2m</u>, which would, in effect, have been other than out of cash flow,
<u>meant that there was a three to</u> <u>four-week gap in placement of cattle
on feed</u>, which is evident in one of the exhibits which was provided to your
Honour earlier on.                                          
    
<P>

The reason being that we didn't know - because we had this question of the
reduction of the $2m hanging over our head, we didn't
feel that we could commit
ourselves to additional expenses until that issue had been resolved.  But from
a supply point of view and
under our obligations with Coles Supermarkets we
had, if you like, held them to their side of the agreement earlier in the year.
We felt that if we were unable to maintain the full pipeline, that the areas
which we had been concerned about with Coles earlier
in the year might in fact
be turned around and put on us, and that Coles may in fact seek damages from us
if they ran out of meat
at the supermarket.
  
<P>

So that was a very major issue, and this question of the $2m continued
throughout the period until funding was finally - additional
funding in line
with cash flows which had been put to the bank on 1 August 1991 remained
outstanding until 31 October 11, and the
funding was actually put in place.
But the letter to which that funding related was not finally signed until 16
January 1992.  So
during the period from 30 June the question of the $2m
resulted in us contemplating something which we'd never ever contemplated
before, and that was to try and refinance with another bank, and we were in
fact refused that refinancing pending the outcome of
the Coles contract from
the National Australia Bank.                
<P>

Q.  Could I just stop you there, I was after the difficulty, if any, that had
this caused you.  You have outlined what happened
<u>in terms of the
facilities</u>; did this cause any difficulty? 
<P>

A.  Yes.  As this related to the operation of the supply contract this created
difficulties, and in particular, over the period
until the funding was put in
place with respect to the negotiations of the Coles contract, because on 31
July, Mr Noel Trinder had
asked us to put a national supply proposal to him by
the end of August.  We had an initial delay by reason of the Deloittes review
-- 
<P>

Q.  Could I ask you, <u>did this cause any difficulty in relation to
supply</u>? 
<P>

A.  Yes. 
<P>

Q.  What was that?                                              
<P>

A.  <u>It was by reason of this three week gap to which I'd already referred,
we had to put in place other supply arrangements whereby -
we had to endeavour
to put in place other supply arrangements whereby other people put cattle on
feed for us</u>, on the one hand -- 
<P>

Q.  <u>Was that successful in overcoming your commitments to Coles or not</u>?

<P>

A.  <u>To a certain extent this was</u>, and we had to address this in another
way; that <u>when the gaps actually arose out the other end of that three week
gap, we had to spend time in September and October filling those
gaps with
carcasses</u>.  So during this three-month period when we were endeavouring to
get the national supply proposal to Coles, we were focusing on doing
things in
running the business which, up until that time, had been running very smoothly.

<P>

(Emphasis added)
<P>

(T632.54-634.5)
<P>

501   	No other Coles' witnesses suggested that the decision of
Coles to terminate negotiations in April 1992 was motivated by any
dissatisfaction in the level of supply by the group of boxed beef.  I am
satisfied that there were no gaps of any significance in
the actual provision
of boxed beef to Coles.
<P>

502   	Turning to other aspects of the group's case relating to
the loss of the Coles supply arrangement, it was clear from the
evidence of
Trinder that he was favourably disposed to the purchase of beef in boxed form.
This arose out of his interest in the
manner in which the Woolworths retail
chain in Australia had followed this path at a time when Trinder was the
managing director
in New Zealand of the supermarket subsidiary of Coles known
as Foodtown.  That chain processed beef from carcass supplies from various
abattoirs in a fashion similar to Coles' operation in Australia.  
<P>

503   	Trinder described the benefits of the boxed beef form of
supply, some of which were plainly cost advantageous to Coles. 
In particular,
by supplying beef in boxed form, Coles would be able to take advantage of one
central processing operation rather
than utilising the multiple processing
units situated at its various retail stores.  It also provided a flexible
method of supply
which could provide selection of cuts which suited the market
pattern of a particular outlet, with the more expensive range being
favoured in
the more affluent locations in which Coles operated.  With those advantages
there were clearly cost saving potentials,
both in terms of avoidance of
wastage and in the best employment of its workforce.  Moreover, it was
Trinder's view that the provision
of beef in boxed form added to the shelf life
of the product when compared with the comparatively quick deterioration of meat
after
butchering the beef in carcass form.  
<P>

504   	It was also Trinder's view that the centralising of the
boning operation lent itself to a higher level of skill in performance
and
presentation than resulted from the butchering activities which Coles conducted
at its many outlets.  As a result of these views,
before coming to Australia
from New Zealand, Trinder had begun exploring the possibilities of purchasing
beef in boxed form.  
<P>

505   	In December 1990, he came to Australia to take up the
position as group general manager of merchandising and marketing for
Coles.
His managing director was Russell Stucki (Stucki).  Russell Ickeringill
(Ickeringill) was the head of finance and administration.
 John Whyte (Whyte)
was the general manager of the meat division and Ronald Stanley Moloney
(Moloney) was the accountant at Coles'
head office in Melbourne.  All were
involved in the consideration of meat supply and marketing, at least so far as
it involved the
group's proposal.  
<P>

506   	At the time of his arrival, the one year supply
arrangement between the group and Coles was in place.  That agreement had
been
concluded by Graeme Kelly (Kelly) who was the Coles director in marketing,
merchandise and development, as appears from his
letter to Wright of 2 August
1990.  That letter confirmed the result of discussions to the effect that Coles
would buy boned and
boxed beef and lamb from PAWS for its Queensland and New
South Wales stores:  that PAWS would secure and operate a boning facility
in
Brisbane:  that the level of supply would be 500 cattle and 5,000 lambs per
week with an intention to increase that quantity "as
desired":  that the
arrangement would be for one year, subject to the proviso that it was in their
respective interests.  The intention
was to "maintain and continue this
association".  At that stage, "operating details including the establishment of
fair and equitable
mechanisms for determining relevant prices and costs" were
yet to be determined.  (It may be noted that there were two identical
letters
from Kelly to Wright, the other being dated 31 July 1990.)
<P>

507   	When Trinder arrived on the scene, the prevailing view of
Stucki, Moloney and Whyte was that the arrangement with the group
was having an
adverse cost impact when compared with the cost of acquiring beef in carcass
form.  That much is evident from the evidence
of Moloney and the
contemporaneous documents.  
<P>

508   	Moloney had been called upon in June of 1990 to review
the group's proposal as set out in the submission of PAWS of 10 June
1990.  It
was his evidence that he formed the opinion that the proposed price per
kilogram of boxed beef, excluding freight, was
in excess of the equivalent
price per kilogram of beef in carcass form.
<P>

509   	Following Kelly's letter of 2 August 1990, Kelly set up a
"project team", which included Moloney, to investigate the "operating
details"
for the supply of beef by the group.  In Moloney's first memorandum on the
subject of 29 August 1990, prepared in conjunction
with Whyte, it was noted
that following discussions with the Wrights in relation to such matters, the
"issues still to be resolved"
included "how costs can be reduced to avoid net
additional costs to Coles of a minimum of $1.9 million per year".  In relation
to
the supply of beef as proposed by the group, it was noted that the
contemplated number of 500 carcasses represented only 60% of the
beef
requirement for Coles Queensland and New South Wales stores, which meant that
they would still be committed to the purchase
of beef from "another supplier in
either carton or carcass form" - clearly a significant consideration given the
need to achieve
cost savings by eliminating multiple butchering operations at
Coles' various stores.  
<P>

510   	Further consideration of the matter by Whyte and Moloney
led to their memorandum of 12 September 1990.  The covering note
to that
memorandum was far from propitious.  It noted the need to renegotiate price
and, further, that if renegotiation was unsuccessful,
then "the net extra costs
(including for a higher quality beef) could be as high as $1,560,000 for a half
year for New South Wales
and Queensland combined".  
<P>

511   	Further discussions took place with the Wrights which
involved Price Waterhouse examining costs aspects of the group's proposal.
 The
group's long term prospects were not helped by a report to Kelly, Ickeringill,
Whyte and another of 22 November 1990 reporting
on the "first complete period
of the boxed beef supply".  On the basis of the authors' cost analysis, the
report was less than flattering,
concluding that trading profit in the boxed
beef stores had declined over the subject period by 12.2% while trading in the
carcass
supplied stores had increased by 12.9%.  While it was noted that it was
"not intended to draw conclusions" at that point, the analysis
of Moloney of
the trading figures was that "the trading profit on meat sales from those
stores which had participated in boxed beef
had fallen substantially ... behind
the trading profit on meat sales from those stores which had continued with the
carcass supply".
 
<P>

512   	At that stage, Price Waterhouse recommended that a
further assessment be carried out, pointing out the problem that, while
the
supply of beef from a central boning and distribution point offered operational
savings, the opportunity of taking advantage
of those savings was compromised
by the "need to maintain a boning/slicing/wrapping facility at store level for
other meats".  
<P>

513   	It is clear that from the beginning of 1991 that these
concerns had reached the level where Coles was taking legal advice
on their
rights under the one year contract to terminate the agreement.  
<P>

514   	Comparative costs of supply of beef remained at the
centre of further discussions between Coles and the Wrights and the minutes
of
the meeting between those parties on 22 February 1991 demonstrated, I think,
the gap in their respective lines of thought.  Those
minutes record David
Wright's analysis of costs as showing, in the first instance, a cost benefit in
favour of boxed beef over carcass
beef of between $157 and $176 per carcass.
It was noted that the figure had been reduced in discussion to a little over
$110.  It
was recorded that a "joint costing" showed "a cost advantage <u>in
favour of carcass beef</u> of $84.22 per body or $2,189,720 per annum".  David
Wright was noted as not agreeing with those figures. 
<P>

515   	The upshot of the meeting was a requirement of Coles that
the group give consideration to a variation of the supply agreement.
 A lengthy
letter from Wright of 1 March 1991 covered most of the implications of that
proposal.
<P>

516   	It is clear from subsequent correspondence that Wright
did not agree with the accuracy of Coles' minutes of the meeting of
22
February.
<P>

517   	A further meeting took place on 6 March 1991 between the
Wrights and Coles which was unsuccessful in resolving the differences
of
opinion concerning the benefits of the supply arrangement to Coles and on 8
March 1991 Coles purported to confirm the outcome
of that meeting as embracing
an agreement that Coles would give three months notice of termination of the
supply agreement on 12
March 1991 on the understanding that in the three month
period up to termination, supply would continue.
<P>

518   	The facsimile of Coles to Wright of 8 March crossed with
Wright's facsimile to Coles from which it is clear that the two
parties had a
very different understanding of what had been agreed at the 6 March 1991
meeting.  This was set out in emphatic terms
in Wright's facsimile to Coles of
9 March.  
<P>

519   	There followed another meeting between the parties on 12
March which prompted Wright's facsimile to Coles of that day, proposing
a
review by Price Waterhouse of the "data relevant to boxes and carcases" pending
which the arrangement was to continue.  In that
facsimile, the following
observation was made:
<P>

"We emphasise that to date we have not had disclosed to us the basis of the
Coles' claim that boxed beef is losing them money. 
On the contrary Coles
figures given us clearly indicate the reverse is the case and therefore believe
this confusion can and should
be clarified by Price Waterhouse."
<P>

520   	Whether that be true or not, what is evident is that
there was considerable tension between Coles and the Wrights, if not
between
Trinder and the Wrights, over the claimed benefits to Coles of the supply
arrangement.  
<P>

521   	The further letter from David Wright to Coles of 15 March
1991, in my view, only emphasised the tension and lack of common
ground
existing between Coles and the Wrights over the cost benefits in the supply of
boxed beef.  
<P>

522   	As a consequence of Coles' dissatisfaction with the cost
of supply of boxed beef, Stucki gave notice of termination in his
letter to
Wright of 15 March 1991.  He required the termination of the supply of boxed
beef "as from 1st April, 1991" after which
supply was required in carcass form.
The reason given for that notice was expressed as follows:
<P>

"The supply of your beef in boxed form, as proven by the results of the project
to date, has not reduced costs and it does not offer
our company greater value
for money.  Therefore, the fundamental purpose of the arrangement is not being
achieved.  Consequently,
we now give you notice that as from two weeks from
Monday the 18th March 1991, our company will cease purchasing boxed beef from
your company.  We will continue to purchase from your company 500 bodies of
cattle in carcass form at the current agreed price of
$2.96 per kilo.  Delivery
of the carcasses will be to our stores in New South Wales and Queensland and we
will agree on a delivery
charge to our stores."
<P>

523   	In his facsimile of 19 March 1991, Wright rejected Coles'
right to terminate and foreshadowed claims for compensation.  The
notice of 15
March 1991 was not acted upon, largely, I think, as a result of the Wrights
prevailing upon Trinder to keep open the
examination of the comparative
benefits to Coles of the supply of beef in boxed or carcass form and the
unwillingness of Coles to
engage in litigation which threatened.  According to
Moloney, the withdrawal of the notice would have permitted the arrangement to
run until September 1991, when it was due to terminate in any event.  
<P>

524   	In relation to the contention that, but for the
distraction of involvement of the Wrights in the preparation of the Deloitte
report, they would have successfully concluded negotiations with Coles in late
1991, Trinder gave the following further evidence:
<P>

"HIGGS:   Q.   Mr Trinder, can I just take you with respect to your first
statement to paragraph 39 on page 14.  You recall, do
you, sending the notice
of termination referred to in that paragraph? 
<P>

A.   I do.  
<P>

Q.   Is that something that you did of your own volition or was it something
that was done at the request of someone else? 
<P>

A.   It was done after discussion with Russell Stucki, who was the managing
director. 
<P>

Q.   Is there any connection between the service of that notice of termination
and the delay in PAWS or the Wrights making a proposal
referred to earlier on
in your statement?  
<P>

A.   Yes, there was.  
<P>

Q.   What was the connection?                                    
<P>

A.   Well, firstly, I had been waiting for a proposal from the Wrights to renew
the agreement which, from memory, was to conclude
in September.  There were a
number of delays and there were some concerns that there was also a problem
with the ability to supply
stock and that was one of our major concerns.
Therefore we had no alternative at that point to serve notice. 
<P>

Q.   Are you able to say what the situation would have been had the proposal
been advanced at the time that it was initially scheduled
to be advanced?
               
<P>

A.   I think had the proposal been put forward --  
<P>

BARKER:  I object.   
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  I'll allow the question  
<P>

THE WITNESS:   Had the proposal been put forward in due time for us to be able
to complete negotiations before the end of the first
contract, I have every
belief that that contract would have been signed.  
<P>

HIGGS:   Q.   In relation to decisions of this type to serve a notice of the
type referred to in paragraph 39 of your statement,
whose responsibility was it
or how was that decision arrived at Coles?  
<P>

A.   Well, that decision would have been arrived at by me discussing that with
Russell Stucki and advising him of the situation
and the concerns about, once
again, the ability to fulfil our requirements to meet consumer demand and also
the concerns probably
that we were starting to get at that point in time about
the Wrights' ability to fulfil that demand."
<P>

(T586.34-587.34.)
<P>

525   	The "notice of termination" referred to was that of 1
October 1991, by Trinder, which gave three month's notice of Coles'
"intention
to cease purchasing boxed beef".  The reason given for that notice was that the
"fundamental objective" in the agreement
in principle of 2 August 1990, namely
that the supply of the boxed meat would either reduce cost or give greater
value for money
to Coles, had not been achieved.  
<P>

526   	The history of negotiations that took place between
Coles' two notices of termination of 15 March and 1 October 1991 and
the terms
of that later notice, in my view, give no support to Trinder's opinion.  
<P>

527   	It may well be that Stucki would have proved more
amenable to the Wrights' proposal at that time than Brian John Beattie
(Beattie) who succeeded him in February 1992.  However, I think one has to
treat with some circumspection the evidence of Trinder
that, on the one hand,
Stucki supported the Wrights' proposal whereas Beattie did not.  Trinder was
cross-examined about his written
statements of evidence and his explanation of
the support of his superiors in relation to the group's proposal was elaborated
as
follows:
<P>

"Q.  You say:                                                    
<P>

"Whilst before Beattie's appointment I had the support of the managing director
Russell Stucki to implement the change from carcasses
to boxed beef, Beattie
was not in favour of such a change due to its effect on profit." 
<P>

Just stopping there, this was after your return from the United States, wasn't
it? 
<P>

A.  Correct.                                                    
<P>

Q.  May I take you to paragraph 6 of your other statement where you say: 
<P>

"Upon my return to Australia in late March 1992 Mr Beattie was replacing Mr
Stucki as managing director."  
<P>

Then we go to paragraph 9 on page 3:   
<P>

"Beattie responded that he was keen to proceed with the boxed beef but was
concerned about the Wrights' problems with their bank."
 
<P>

On the one hand you say that Beattie was not in favour of such a change and on
the other you say that he said he was keen to proceed?
 
<P>

A.  That's understandable.  Firstly, Beattie was concerned - like Russell
Stucki was - about the margin erosion, and they had their
reasons for that.
But on the other hand he also was supportive to see us change and to move into
boxed beef.  In fact -- 
<P>

Q.  Mr Trinder, just pause there if you wouldn't mind.  You seem to say without
equivocation in your first statement that Beattie
was not in favour of such a
change, due to its effect on profit.  In your second statement you say Beattie
responded that he was
keen to proceed with boxed beef, but was concerned about
the Wrights' problem with their bank?  
<P>

A.  Absolutely.   
<P>

Q.  Do you say those two statements stand together?  
<P>

A.  Pretty well.  
<P>

Q.  On the one hand he was not in favour, and on the other hand he was keen to
proceed? 
<P>

A.  It was no different to Russell Stucki.  Russell Stucki was concerned about
the erosion of margin and was keen to proceed as
well, yes.  
<P>

Q.  He wasn't just concerned about the erosion of margin, according to -- 
<P>

A.  Obviously the problem --  
<P>

Q.  Your paragraph 49 - would you mind waiting for the question, please?  He
was not in favour of such a change, you said.   
<P>

HIGGS:  I object, that's not the whole --  
<P>

WITNESS:  He wasn't in favour of any change -- 
<P>

HIGGS:  Sorry, Mr Trinder, wait.  
<P>

BARKER:  Q.  He was not in favour of such a change due to its effect on profit;
you say there that he was not in favour of such
a change.  You say in the other
statement he was keen to proceed? 
<P>

A.  And if you read on in that paragraph on page 4, all right, they had only
just dropped their prices so Beattie had, I guess,
realised that the price was
coming down would tend to actually help offset the margin erosion.  And if you
read on, it says, "drop
the price", and he was concerned that it had been
increased again so quickly.  So, yes, he was concerned about the margin.
Secondly,
he was concerned about the banks, all right.  He didn't want to
proceed if the margin erosion was to continue, inevitably, but the
prices had
been dropped and I guess therefore he wasn't reluctant to proceed. 
<P>

Q.  You "guess therefore"?  
<P>

A.  I know, sir."
<P>

(T594.47 - 596.13.)
<P>

528   	Beattie was called to give evidence in the bank's case
and did not adopt the position adopted by Trinder.  Although I have
occasion to
criticise the reliability of Beattie's evidence, I am not prepared to accept
Trinder's view of the support of his superiors
in Coles for the group's
proposal as distinct from Coles' possible interest in the substitution of boxed
beef for beef in carcass
form.  
<P>

529   	There also remained within the Coles organisation a
resistance at worker level to the changes to operations at the various
Coles'
outlets involved in the group's proposal and there remained a distinct concern
on the part of influential elements within
Coles that the group's proposal
involved serious cost disadvantages to Coles.  
<P>

530   	The Coles interoffice memorandum of 28 June 1991, I
think, is worth reproducing to indicate something of the relationship
between
the Wrights and what I perceive to be those within Coles who either resisted or
were working against the group's proposal.
 The memorandum follows:
<P>

"My brief visit to Brisbane this week resulted in a meeting with <b>Andrew
Tregaskis</b>:  <b>Trevor Stevens</b>:  and <b>David Wright Jr</b> (Esrolem) to
finalise and sign-off the details of the trial.  Both Andrew and myself also
gave a cordial welcome to Mr Bill Timberlake,
the visiting USA meat expert
brought out here by Esrolem, who also attended the meeting.
<P>

At Wednesday's meeting we went through all details of the 12 Store/4 week
trial, to be run through Period 12.  All procedures, measurements,
and items to
be recorded were discussed in some detail.  Some enhancements were made, the
main one being a decision to place a "recorder"
in each Store to carry out the
recording tasks, thereby ensuring that 100% accuracy will occur.   The
"recorder" will have no other
tasks.  At the end of the lengthy meeting, David
Wright Jr and Bill Timberlake agreed that the trial was well-organised and
agreed
that the information to be obtained was valid and would provide the
answers.  They were (direct quote) "<b>very comfortable</b>" with our plans.
The meeting therefore concluded on a very positive note.
<P>

Unfortunately, the following morning David Wright Jr set us right back on our
heels by asserting that a 4-week trial was not long
enough!  This discussion
took place when Trevor Stevens and myself visited Esrolem's boning room (more
as a courtesy than anything
else).  David Wright Jr was firmly reminded that he
had endorsed the trial the previous afternoon:  that Coles traditionally
manages
and reports its business activities on a four or five week basis:  that
considerable extra resources were to be put into the trial,
at a cost to Coles:
and finally that the arrangements stand.
<P>

Regrettably, it seems a cast-iron certainty that unless the trial results are
wholly favourable to Esrolem, they will continue to
argue their case, strongly
and inflexibly.  We must therefore prepare for this probability.
<P>

Bill Timberlake's involvement in the trial and in our Stores was clarified, and
the protocol for his "back-room" visits was established.
<P>

I believe that the trial will be competently and professionally conducted.  It
has ceratinly (sic) been planned that way, with excellent
input from John
Chessher and Trevor Stevens over the past several weeks.  We should therefore
be able to very quickly reach a decision
based on thoroughly objective results
early in Period 1.
<P>

This may not be the end of this saga, but it may be the beginning of the
end."
<P>

531   	Of particular significance, I think, in the period
leading up to the 1 October 1991 notice of termination, was the summary
of the
group's proposal prepared by Moloney which, according to him, was circulated to
the project team appointed by Kelly in relation
to the proposal.  To say the
least, that report was less than favourable to the group's prospects.  It noted
that a trial to compare
costs of the alternative methods of beef supply
disclosed a loss in profit per annum in Queensland of approximately $7,460,000.
It
was Moloney's evidence that it was in that context that the 1 October 1991
notice was given.  Having regard to the terms of that
notice, I think that
evidence should be accepted.
<P>

532   	As earlier stated, I consider the bank was entitled to
require a review of the group by Deloitte in August 1991.  Although
not central
to my thinking on that issue, it is not without relevance that, from the
beginning of 1991, Wright had resisted the bank's
proposal that such a review
should be carried out.  I have had occasion to voice some distaste at the way
in which Buckley handled
the demand for the Deloitte review in the meeting of 1
August 1991.  However, that criticism does not touch upon the entitlement
of
the bank to insist upon the review.
<P>

533   	I accept the evidence of David Wright that he was delayed
in presenting a detailed proposal to Coles in the third quarter
of 1991 as a
result of the bank demanding the carrying out of the Deloitte review in that
period.  However, for the reasons given,
I doubt very much whether that delay
in submitting a proposal contributed to the group's failure to successfully
conclude negotiations
with Coles.  
<P>

534   	I think the salient points in the dealings between Coles
and the Wrights following the 1 October 1991 notice are to be found
in the 22
October 1991 submission of the group entitled "<b>Coles P.A. Wright &amp; Sons
Cargill strategic alliance</b>" and the response of Coles in Trinder's
facsimile of 11 November 1991 which set out the "fundamental
principles/objectives of the
new strategic alliance".  Those objectives were
identified as follows:
<P>

"*	Coles seeks to increase its market share of the total meat retail market.
The way to achieve this is by offering a superior product
at the same or better
price than our competitors.
<P>

*	That profit contribution be maintained at current levels and increased in
line with sales growth.
<P>

*	That the success of Prime Pac (new J.V. company) be directly linked to the
success of Coles i.e. Prime Pac's sales and profit
growth can only come from
the growth of Coles meat sales and not through a cost plus mentality which
seeks to increase margin.
<P>

*	That the new company (Prime Pac) be the sole and dedicated buying/processing
unit to Coles.  Ensuring a consistent quality and
service is provided at the
right cost to ensure Coles objectives are met.
<P>

*	Total dedication by Cargill and Wrights to work with Coles to make Coles the
most successful meat retailer in Australia.  Allocation
of resources and
expertise to help Coles make the transition and to develop the skills and
appropriate systems to improve efficiencies
in meat retailing.
<P>

*	Access to Cargills international resources in respect to new development in
technology and meat retailing opportunities to gain
a strategic advantage.
<P>

*	That Coles retains control in conjunction with Prime Pac on the entire cost
chain.  That Coles fully understands the costs associated
with the entire
process, from the purchase of raw materials through to the retail counter.
<P>

*	An open book policy which allows Coles to agree up front of the expected
profit margin of Prime Pac.
<P>

	Free access to fully audit the trail of all costs associated with the supply
chain.
<P>

*	That Coles retains control over the quality specifications for the product
and is given a full understanding of the entire quality
chain which must meet
with Coles approval.
<P>

*	That Coles will have no capital contribution to make to the alliance other
than to its own retail operations.
<P>

*	That Coles is indemnified and will accept no liability for the Prime Pac
operation.
<P>

*	That Coles retain the right at all times to terminate the agreement on
reasonable grounds should the principles/objectives of
the alliance not be
met."
<P>

In a note attached to that statement, Trinder recorded that amongst the issues
requiring consideration, the cost benefits to Coles
figured prominently.  
<P>

535   	Those documents, as I view the evidence, formed the
platform for discussions which followed between Coles and the Wrights
up to the
time of Coles' notice of termination of negotiations of 1 April 1992.  The 11
November 1991 facsimile of Trinder, setting
out the basis for further
discussion, reflected Trinder's continued interest in the possible benefits of
the supply of the beef in
boxed form.  The period between November 1991 and 1
April 1992, when the final notice of termination of negotiations was given by
Coles, calls for consideration of the group's case that the bank's insistence
upon triggering the price mechanism for an increase
in the price of the boxed
beef combined with the need to reveal to Coles that the group had lost the
support of the bank, contributed
to the failure of negotiations.  
<P>

536   	The bank has also raised an issue that the communications
between the solicitors for Coles and for the proposed joint venture
of Cargill
and the group had reached a point where there were insurmountable obstacles to
the joint venture becoming a national,
long term supplier to Coles.  
<P>

537   	I am unable to accept that any disclosure to Coles by the
Wrights of the loss of bank support for the group was a factor
that one should
have regard to in considering the responsibility of the bank for the failure of
the negotiations with Coles.  I fail
to see why it would have been necessary,
or even sensible, to convey to Coles the group's predicament with the bank.
There was a
perfectly legitimate basis for seeking a price increase:  the
prevailing price of supply had been calculated on a rate of supply
double that
of the then existing volume and, as a consequence, it represented a losing
proposition.  However, there is nothing in
the contemporaneous records to
support the group's case that this was a factor in Coles giving its 1 April
1992 notice.  It is not
supported by Beattie.  It may have been a factor in
Trinder's thinking.  However, I have significant difficulty in accepting that,
in light of his joint memorandum with Ickeringill to Beattie of 3 April 1992
outlining the history of the supply of boxed beef by
the group and the
circumstances which gave rise to the notice terminating negotiations.  There is
no mention of any consideration
of a lack of bank support for the group.  
<P>

538   	The joint memorandum was triggered by Wright's facsimile
to Trinder of 2 April 1992.  That communication challenged the entitlement
of
Coles to bring the supply arrangement to an end without compensating the group
for "the costs which (would) be incurred as a result
of termination".  I note,
in relation to that facsimile, that included in the costs was the effect
termination would have on the
"supply pipeline of approximately 5,000 cattle,
numbers subject to confirmation, in feedlots dedicated to Coles in accordance
with
the numbers required which (would) need to be cleared at the current
agreed price".  Other major costs of cancellation were identified
in that
facsimile.  My interest in that element of the cost is its incompatibility with
any suggestion that gaps in supply of boxed
beef had any role to play in Coles'
decision to call off further supply of boxed beef by the group.  
<P>

539   	The joint memorandum of Trinder and Ickeringill of 3
April 1992 explained the basis of the 1 April 1992 notice as sounding
purely in
the economics of the group's proposal as follows:
<P>

"In October 1991 renegotiations concentrated on expanding the weekly supply
delivered into store to:
<P>

300 head of Premium Brand to Queensland at $4.48 per Kg
<P>

500 head of Coles Brand to Queensland at $4.18 per Kg
<P>

300 head of Premium Brand to New South Wales at $4.22 per Kg
<P>

Extensive discussions were held to develop the basis of the strategic alliance
with P.A. Wrights and Cargill.  A Heads of Agreement
has been drafted but not
finalised.  The main point still to be resolved was how to set the purchase
price for the beef.
<P>

The new prices commenced in January but the supply remains at 250 head of
Premium per week into each of Queensland and New South
Wales.
<P>

If the prices were maintained and the volumes were increased from the current
500 head per week to 1,100 head per week the boxed-beef
would have cost $2.9
million per year more than carcass form beef.  After deducting the In-store
labour saving projected at $1.3
million the net additional cost would be $1.6
million per year.
<P>

The prices of boxed-beef were increased in March 1991 by 50 cents per Kg boned
to cover the increased costs of P.A. Wrights for
cattle and feedlot.  On this
basis and the proposed 1,100 per week, boxed-beef would cost an additional $6.1
million ($7.4 million
product cost less $1.3 million in labour saving) above
the cost of carcass beef in a full year.
<P>

<u>March Revised Proposal</u>
<P>

The revised proposal received from P.A. Wrights on 30/3/92 was for supply to
Queensland each week of:
<P>

	250 head of Premium Brand per week at $4.98 per Kg
<P>

	500 head of Coles Brand per week at $4.48 per Kg
<P>

The current prices for supply in carcass form in Queensland is Premium $2.84
per Kg and Coles of $2.61 per Kg.  On this basis the
cost of the proposal is
$4.6 million above the cost of carcass product less $0.9 million in labour
saving for a net additional cost
of $3.7 million.
<P>

<u>Conclusion</u>
<P>

As a result of the on going additional costs and their expected continuation in
the foreseeable future, it was decided to cease
the purchase of boxed-beef and
to revert to a carcass supply.
<P>

The United States experience suggests benefits from boxed-beef that we were not
able to achieve in our current environment.  It
has been decided, with your
agreement, that we will seek to reproduce these benefits in a two store trial
in Victoria that will limit
the cost of the exercise.
<P>

Currently we do not have an ongoing contractual arrangement with P.A. Wright
&amp; Sons.  Their supply is on a weekly basis with
the understanding that we
will purchase the stock that is in the `pipeline' (about 5,000 head) at the
current rate of approximately
500 head per week."
<P>

540   	While it may be accepted that the Wrights were left with
little choice by the bank other than to trigger a mechanism for
a price
increase in the arrangement with Coles and that the consequent price increase
did not help its cause with Coles, I think
it is clear from this memorandum
that Coles remained unconvinced, independently of that price increase, of the
cost benefits to it.
 Without that increase, it projected a net additional cost
of $1,600,000 per annum of acquiring and marketing boxed beef when compared
with the cost of the purchase of beef in carcass form.  
<P>

541   	David Wright has given evidence, which I accept, that
there were avenues for substantial cost savings through volume marketing,
new
industrial conditions and renegotiated contracts with suppliers to the group
which could have been shared by Coles and the joint
venture had the group's
proposal found favour with Coles.  I have no difficulty in accepting that
evidence.  However, I am unable
to accept that the price increase in February
1992 resulted, or played a measurable role, in the decision of Coles to
terminate supply
and further negotiations.  
<P>

542   	In my view, the facsimile of David Wright to Beattie of
31 March 1992 is an uncomfortable reminder that, almost from the
inception of
the group's dealings with Coles, there had been a wrangling over the proper
basis of costing the benefits of the group's
proposal and a final reminder that
the Wrights had been unable to convince Coles that their cost analyses were
correct.  According
to David Wright's detailed comparison, there was a net
benefit per head to Coles of $12.92 which, when translated into a supply chain
of 500 or 1,000 head per week, as envisaged, was not insignificant.  However,
it can be contrasted with the joint memorandum of Trinder
and Ickeringill to
Beattie of 3 April 1992.  
<P>

543   	As to the bank's case that the negotiations had faltered
at the legal level in terms of the exchange of draft agreements
between the
solicitors for Coles and for the proposed joint venture, I have little doubt
that, if the parties had been satisfied
as to the potential commercial benefits
to them of the proposal under discussion, legal impediments would have been
overcome.  I
accept that there was an absence of agreement upon important terms
which Coles' solicitors advised were non-negotiable.  I think
that states the
position at its highest.  Even so, I am satisfied that, given an acceptance of
the commercial benefits of the proposal
by the parties, the proposed joint
venture, or, for that matter, the group, would have been willing to accommodate
Coles' position.
 The evidence of David Wright on the group's willingness to
accommodate compromise with Coles on the legal terms of the agreement
should be
accepted.  
<P>

544   	The successful negotiation of a supply agreement with
Coles was, I think, critical to the ability of the Wrights to demonstrate
to
the bank the commercial integrity of the group in the long term.  
<P>

545   	Once the Coles supply arrangement collapsed, particularly
in the rural, seasonal and market conditions that then prevailed,
there were
few options open to the group to remedy its financial predicament.  Those
options, I think, were probably limited to an
orderly reduction of assets and
hence borrowings, or obtaining equity capital.
<P>

546   	The period following the 1 April 1992 notice for June
1992 was marked by some reasonably strong exchanges involving threat
of
litigation and an eventual resolution as noted in the facsimile of Coles to
Wright of 4 June 1992 which provided for cessation
of deliveries "of remaining
cattle" in the week ending 19 June 1992.  
<P>

547   	The run down of the supply pipeline in the months of
April to June 1992 did not see the end of the dealings between Coles
and the
Wrights.  Nothing, in my view, turns on the further efforts by the Wrights to
engage Coles in fruitful discussion aimed at
the resumption of negotiations for
the supply of boxed beef.  Those discussions took place between the Wrights,
Trinder and Beattie
and lasted until November 1992.  Perhaps the most
significant feature of that evidence is its utility in testing the reliability
of the evidence of Beattie.
<P>

548   	Beattie was the managing director of Coles Supermarkets,
taking up that position in February 1992 and remaining so employed
until June
1994 when he became Chief Executive of the Victoria Racing Club.  If one was to
look at his evidence-in-chief in isolation,
there would be no room for doubting
that the joint venture proposal failed on economic grounds.  Although Trinder
carried the responsibility
for negotiating an acceptable agreement with the
Wrights, Coles required the authorisation of its managing director to enter
into
any arrangement with the group or the joint venture.  
<P>

549   	According to his evidence-in-chief, at the outset, he
formed a jaundiced view of the group's proposal.  He recalled that
when he
joined Coles, the prevailing view within the organisation was "that the
Wrights' proposal should not proceed".  It was his
recollection that throughout
April 1992, following the notice of termination of negotiations and of supply,
he had endeavoured, unsuccessfully,
to convey to the Wrights that there was no
prospect of further negotiations.  So it was, he said:
<P>

"I then instructed Miss Halloran to prepare the letter to Mr Werksman dated 27
April 1992 to again make it clear that Coles was
not prepared to continue
negotiations in relation to the supply of boxed beef by the Wrights.  That was
the last time that I recall
the Wrights' proposal for the supply of boxed beef
being raised with Coles."
<P>

550   	As appears later in these reasons, it is quite apparent
that that recollection was extraordinarily faulty.  Yet he said:
<P>

"I believe that had there been any such negotiations or discussions they are
matters of which I would have been aware, both because
of my position within
the Coles organisation, and my previous involvement with the Wrights...".
<P>

551   	In general, his evidence contradicted that of Trinder in
which Trinder attributed to Beattie concern about the loss of confidence
of the
bank in the group.  It was his evidence that he was unaware of that
relationship.  He was not opposed, in principle, to the
purchase by Coles of
beef in boxed form.  His opposition to the Wrights' proposal stemmed from his
view that it "had proved to be
a financial disaster for all concerned".  He
said that he was "of the view that Coles should withdraw as quickly as possible
from
the Wrights' boxed beef proposal".  He said that was a view that was
shared by others, including Whyte, Moloney and Lawrence Watson.
 He further
expressed the view that "it would have been grossly incompetent of (him or
Trinder) to continue with negotiations with
the Wrights or to extend the
trial".  
<P>

552   	In that regard he said that although "the proposal would
not have proceeded ... if (Trinder) did not support it, it was ultimately
(Beattie's) decision as to whether Coles entered into any arrangement with the
Wrights".  He was not aware of any delay in the submission
of the group's
proposal as having any bearing upon the decision to terminate negotiations. He
also expressed the view that the change
in price in February 1992 was not a
matter that played any part in the decision to terminate negotiations.
<P>

553   	Beattie presented as a quite unsatisfactory witness.  His
answers often were not responsive.  He proved to be argumentative
and not in a
particularly enlightened way.  I came to the conclusion that his memory,
unaided by documents, was poor.
<P>

554   	I think that much is clear from the evidence which
established that in early and late July 1992, Beattie and Trinder were
engaged
in fairly substantial discussions with the Wrights, with the latter
endeavouring to convince Coles of the benefit of the
boxed beef proposal.
Subsequent to those discussions the Wrights submitted to Coles a quite detailed
and extensive cost analysis
called "<b>National Processing Facility costing
scenarios</b>" dated 12 September 1992.  
<P>

555   	There had been a meeting arranged between the parties in
October 1992 to review, among other things, Coles' analysis of a
ten store
trial of the group's boxed beef product.  A further quite detailed submission
was presented by the Wrights by facsimile
to Trinder in preparation for the
October meeting.
<P>

556   	The last evidence of communication between the Wrights
and Beattie was the facsimile of Wright to Beattie of 20 November
1992
described as "a last attempt to resurrect our proposition to Coles of a
"National Food Factory"."  The forlorn tone of that
introduction was explained
by the following:
<P>

"Late yesterday afternoon, after 22 months of supply, six months of excessive
losses plus five additional months of discussions
at a further cost of over
$200,000 to ourselves, we were advised that Coles would be proceeding with
boxed beef, commencing in Victoria
but would not be inviting V2V Primepac to
participate."
<P>

557   	In the light of that evidence, I think it is inescapable
that when it comes to detail, Beattie's evidence should be treated
as quite
unreliable, given his complete lack of recall of the 1992 post April
negotiations in which he was involved with the Wrights.
 However, his
cross-examination left me in no doubt that he had not favoured the group's
proposal, and that it would have been highly
unlikely for agreement to have
been reached with him in 1992.  I think that is emphasised by the position of
Moloney, as earlier
referred to.
<P>

558   	In my view, the group gains little comfort in its case
from the fact that Coles subsequently engaged in the marketing of
boxed beef.
The method by which that marketing is carried out was described by Moloney as
follows:
<P>

"Q.  Then lastly, compare and contrast the proposals which you reviewed from
PAWS, contrasted with the boxed beef purchasing strategies
which were
ultimately implemented, which are still current, would you tell us what
likenesses and differences there are?
<P>

A.  First of all in time difference, it is about six years or  so.
<P>

Q.  But why does that make a difference?
<P>

A.  Because we had to learn how to do it.  The proposal from PAWS was for beef,
lamb and pork, I checked last week, we were not
doing any pork with any bone in
it, there's some small parts of the boneless product is going into bags.  Not
doing lamb and we are
doing beef.
<P>

	So concentrating on the beef, we started off trialing with a small supplier in
Victoria where they had the boning function and
we went out, our livestock
buyers went to the farm and made the contracts with the farmers for the beef to
come from there.  So from
that way we were able to control all the way through
what the supply chain was and understood the quality, the scheduling to get
sufficient numbers each week, et cetera, and we developed the skills necessary
over that time because to do it not just in Victoria
but in New South Wales and
Queensland, we haven't done it in Western Australia or South Australia and we
haven't done it in Tassie,
although Tassie may not ever be done, Western
Australia and South Australia probably will be done shortly.
<P>

So the main thing is to have control over the full change and be able to keep
the costs down and most of that beef for the interstate
suppliers is sourced
out of Victoria and southern New South Wales, that's in Victoria, New South
Wales and when you go into South
Australia, the Queensland product is sourced
from Queensland, is my understanding of it.  As I am not in supermarkets now, I
am in
another role, I haven't got the exact sourcing all the time.
<P>

Q.  Anyway that's the difference that you are able to identify with your
present knowledge?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  Accompanying that control of the supply chain right through is the
associated record-keeping systems I assume?
<P>

A.  That's right.
<P>

(T1491 - 1492.8.)
<P>

559   	The significant differences in the present Coles
arrangement for supply of its boxed beef requirements in Eastern Australia,
when compared with the group's proposal, lies in the absence of dependence upon
any one supplier.  Cattle for processing into boxed
beef are purchased by
Coles' own buyers operating in the various cattle markets.  
<P>

560   	There are two general aspects of the Trinder evidence
that I think require comment.  The first aspect is that I think his
evidence
needs to be viewed in the context of the internal records of Coles which, in
some instances, if not all, sees him aligned
with those within Coles who were
critical of the Wright proposal on grounds of its adverse cost impact on Coles'
operations.  The
other aspect is his involvement with Stucki in a meeting with
Wright and David Wright in which, during the course of negotiations,
they
requested payment of $1,000,000.  
<P>

561   	The proposal has some unsatisfactory commercial overtones
and it is difficult to see why a price variation would not have
accommodated
Coles' requirements, if it was seen that the group's pricing mechanism was
structured at too high a rate.  As it happened,
the Wrights were not favourably
disposed to this proposal and, after some consultation between themselves,
offered an alternative
sum of $100,000.  That aspect of the negotiations did
not proceed further, so far as the evidence disclosed.  
<P>

562   	For those reasons, I have been left in little doubt that,
if the group was permitted to run a loss of expectation case notwithstanding
its failure to support that case by the filing of statements of evidence
quantifying such loss, that claim would fail. 
<P>

563   	There only remains to consider the issue of
unreasonableness sought to be raised in relation to the exercise of the bank's
express powers under the facility relied upon in the remaining period from 1993
following the James report.   
<P>

564   	Once the position had been reached that the Coles
contract had been lost, and, certainly, once the bank was in receipt of
the
James report, which seriously questioned the long term viability of the group
without reduction of debt through a judicious property
sale, I think the bank's
position was impregnable in so far as it sought a) to implement, in an orderly
way, a rationalising of the
group's enterprise by the sale of selected
properties with the object of reducing indebtedness to the bank and b) to
control deterioration
in the group account, at times, by requiring the sale of
livestock.
<P>

565   	The conclusion I have reached is that the bank's general
approach to the reduction of debt fell squarely within its entitlement
to
enforce the terms of its facilities, including the terms of the bank's facility
letter of 2 January 1991.  That view holds good
whether consideration is
directed to requirements of the sale of real estate or the sale of livestock
and whether or not there is
imported into the bank's exercise of those
entitlements, a requirement of reasonableness.
<P>

566   	It was the evidence of the Wrights that the bank's
conduct in this period continued to put pressure on the sale of part of
the
group's breeding herd.  However, I would not regard those consequences of the
bank's requirements as either unreasonable or in
any way particularly
exceptional, given the general plight of the rural industry which enveloped the
eastern states in that period.
 Throughout most of the time the individual
properties held by the group, for practical purposes, may be regarded as badly
affected
by drought and, in my view, the level of sales of livestock which
could be described as forced sales was not exceptional and may
have even
compared favourably with the experience of others.  
<P>

567   	Exhibit 5 was a stock count of the group to 30 June 1994
to which I have earlier made reference.  That showed the female
herd as
constant, in general, throughout 1993 and 1994.  If anything, there was an
increase of a thousand or two.  A similar observation
may be made of total
cattle numbers in that period.  In that regard, I note that there has been led
a substantial body of evidence
concerning the stocking practices of the group
to which reference is later made in these reasons.  What does come out of those
expert
views is that, on any view, the Wrights followed a grazing program which
saw the group's properties carrying high stock numbers and
using
interconnecting stock routes to augment the carrying capacity of those
properties.  With that program in place, there is little
doubt, in my view,
that the impact of drought would be intense.  
<P>

568   	I think the evidence disclosed that several of the bank's
representatives in their dealings with the Wrights in this period
were mindful
of the futility of requiring a forced sale of the breeding herd as a long term
strategy in reducing debt, having regard
to the dependence of the cashflow of
the group upon sale of progeny of the breeding herd.  
<P>

569   	The group responded in writing to the James report in two
letters of 11 and 12 February 1993.  That response, together with
the James
report, I think, formed the platform upon which the bank began thereafter to
address reduction of debt by orderly sale
of selected properties.  The Wrights
"revised the future strategy for (the group's) enterprise (which) resulted in
the production
of a far more viable proposal than the one under consideration
by" James.  In what was described as "Scenario 2", Wright identified
its
"salient features" as including the "immediate disposal of ... Kindon with a
substantial improvement in ... gearing levels" and
the "retention of all ...
NSW properties thus maintaining the current high level of (the) breeding herd".
It was said that this strategy
would enable the group to capitalise "on the
dynamic productivity of this large herd which (had then) nearly achieved the
state of
equilibrium targeted in 1988 ...".  It was said that the "herd (was)
poised ready to achieve (the group's) objectives".  
<P>

570   	With the Wright communication there were provided the
financial projections which were said to support the group's approach.
 Those
projections were predicated on a sale of Kindon in March 1993.  A backup to
those projections took the form of a cashflow
budget and a five year plan dated
15 February 1993, produced by the group for the period 1 January 1993 to 31
December 1997.  It
was a massive analysis with a remarkable collection of
detail.
<P>

571   	A meeting of account executives on 26 February 1993
attended by Peter Clarke, the state manager in credit, Buckley, Gregory
Pidcock
(Pidcock), the senior manager, credit, Armitage and Davis considered the group
account on the premise of a sale of Kindon.
 They agreed that, in the event of
sale not proceeding as planned, penalty rates would apply and expressed the
"preference to achieve
a regular principal repayment and in a shorter
timeframe" than that proposed by Wright.  The approach was endorsed by
Fotheringham.

<P>

572   	James was retained by the bank to further report on
questions raised by the group's proposal.  Although the group's projections
had
proceeded on the basis of a sale of Kindon by 31 March 1993, that was never, I
would have thought, a realistic proposal and so
it was that Wright wrote to
Armitage on 26 March with a request that the sale of Kindon be postponed to "a
more propitious time",
thought to be in August or in September.  
<P>

573   	James submitted a draft report, on 31 March, in which he
offered the view that Boonaldoon should also be sold.  This was
questioned by
Wright in a facsimile of 8 April 1993 to Armitage.  In observations regarding
the group's approach to the retention
of New South Wales properties, it is
noteworthy that Wright described the prevailing drought conditions as having
persisted for some
two years and was one of the "worst in history".  The final
report of James of 3 May 1993 (James' final report) showed that he was
unmoved
by the group's resistance to the sale of Boonaldoon.  
<P>

574   	An attack has been made by the bank in these proceedings
on the credibility of the group's representation case.  In particular,
it was
submitted that a thirty six page letter (settled in conference with senior
counsel) from Wright to the bank of 6 February
1996, in response to the bank's
letter of demand of 2 February 1996, raised no such case.  There is some
justification for that criticism
in so far as the body of the letter is silent
on the importance of the June meeting as presented in these proceedings.
However, at
page 22 of the letter, reference is made to Wright's letter to the
bank of 13 May 1993.   Its contents were apparently considered
important enough
to cause Wright to enclose a copy of it with his February 1996 letter.  In that
letter, Wright emphasised that "the
Bank had previously endorsed (the group's)
new enterprise strategy, initiated in 1988, to change (their) enterprise
direction from
a mixed breeding and fattening operation to a cow calf operation
only", noting that this involved "a short to medium term negative
impact on
cash flow".  Wright pointed to the benefit of this strategy reflected in the
increase of female numbers from 9,000 in 1988
to 21,500 by May 1993.  It was in
the 13 May letter that Wright commented on the proposed sale of property in
James' final report
in the following terms:
<P>

Whilst the Ernst and Young report contains many assumptions with which we
strongly disagree, we had already ourselves reached the
conclusion that the
properties Boonaldoon and Kindon should be disposed of as soon as possible when
market and seasonal circumstances
are appropriate."
<P>

575   	The credit memorandum of 20 May 1993 raised by Armitage
gave an extremely detailed review of the group account, primarily
aimed at
reviewing "in detail the events since ... 7 October 1992, in particular the
findings of Ernst &amp; Young ... (and) was
prepared as a result of ...
discussions ..." at meetings on 2 March and 13 May with the Wrights.  
<P>

576   	At the latter meeting, Wright raised with Armitage the
decision of the group to pursue equity capital for the group's enterprise.
This had been mooted by James in a discussion with Wright.  In James' facsimile
to Wright of 27 May 1993 he further outlined such
a possibility and named a
particular business interest located in the United Kingdom as a possible
interested equity participant.
 That business interest turned out to be one
represented by Derek Shaw (Shaw).  
<P>

577   	In my view, the credit memorandum of 20 May 1993 of
Armitage represented a reasonably balanced appraisal of the facilities
and the
banking relationship with the group.  It did not favour debt reduction through
"a simple herd reduction" and explored the
recent discussions concerning the
sale of Kindon and Boonaldoon.  Armitage acknowledged the change in herd
strategy dating back to
1988 and was mindful of the dilemma created by the
drought conditions current at the time of his memorandum.  He referred to the
possibility of the group obtaining an equity participant as: 
<P>

"not seen as another tactic of "changing the goal posts" once again, or buying
time but as a serious alternative to reduce debt
(substantially in one hit) and
retain the group's long term objective by maintaining its competitive
advantages by its size/economies
of scale and realising the benefits of years
that have been invested in building up to their optimum breeding herd
structure/size
which is the key to generating the group's profitability in the
medium to long term."
<P>

578   	The memorandum is in strong contrast to the hard line
reflected in Buckley's memorandum of 3 June 1993.  That was one which
I think
reflected much of Buckley's disenchantment with the group account.  Expressed
in ways in which I have had occasion to question,
he made a number of
observations which are uncomplimentary of Wright's conduct of the account.
<P>

579   	The general tone of Buckley's memorandum is in keeping
with Wright's evidence of his Sydney meeting with Fenton and Buckley
in early
June which, according to Wright, was held to discuss the "seriously
deteriorated relationship with the Bank".  
<P>

580   	Wright's complaint was that the bank's demands were
continuing to have the effect of a forced sale of the group's breeding
herd and
was at odds with the approach adopted by Fotheringham in the meeting with him.
According to Wright, that drew the response
from Buckley as follows:
<P>

"It will only be over my dead body that the Bank will give you any further
consideration."
<P>

581   	According to Wright, Fenton dissociated himself from that
remark.  I have no reason to doubt that something along those lines
was
expressed by Buckley, having regard to the contents of his memorandum to
Armitage of 3 June 1993 in which his recommendations
gave the group little room
to move and concluded with the following observation:
<P>

"We are not adverse to directors now making alternative banking
arrangements."
<P>

I think when Buckley wrote that he could not have been unaware that such an
alternative was no longer open to the group.  Buckley
had also recommended
capping the overdraft facility at $2,850,000.  That attitude did not prevail.
As a consequence of the credit
memorandum of 30 June 1993, the limit was
increased by $700,000.  
<P>

582   	This increase in facilities was gained as a result of
negotiations between the parties which included agreement upon completion
of
some sales of livestock by 30 September 1993 and planned sales in November and
December of that year.  Those sales did not eventuate,
at least, not as then
contemplated.  I think that much is evident from the monthly reports of Hudson.
His report for July 1993 recorded
the sale of 4,396 head, mainly weaner cattle,
the sale of which the group had been "decided to bring forward ... from
October" as
"Boonaldoon was not ready to receive the weaner cattle from the
Tablelands for value adding in late June".  The monthly report for
August
simply noted that those sales were "uplifted" in that month.  I do not regard
those as forced sales by reason of any unreasonable
conduct of the bank as
presently complained of by the group.  
<P>

583   	Hudson's facsimile of 15 October 1993 to the bank
submitted a revised cashflow forecast in what he described as the "Preferred
Case", which reflected a withholding of the sale of female cattle.  This had
followed a meeting with Wright, Phillip and David Wright,
Robertson, Nicholls,
Hudson, Buckley, Punch and Davis on 13 October 1993 at which a feasibility
study was presented to the bank in
relation to a joint venture proposal
involving Shaw.  I doubt whether anything turns on the detail of the discussion
that took place
at that meeting as to which there was some disagreement between
the witnesses for the bank and those called in the group's case.
<P>

584   	It was implicit in the group's joint venture proposal
involving Shaw that there would be no sale of the female herd until
"year end",
when the livestock would pass into the proposed joint venture.   
<P>

585   	The joint venture proposal was the subject of an overview
diary note of Davis of 20 October 1993.  It is clear, both from
the Wrights'
evidence of the meeting of 13 October and Davis' diary note of 20 October 1993,
that the joint venture proposal received
a favourable response from the bank's
representatives, with the business banking sector in favour of varying the
timeframe for debt
reduction to accommodate it.  
<P>

586   	The consequent credit memorandum of 4 November 1993 and
the bank's letter to Wright of 24 November 1993 reflected that response.
 The
bank deferred reduction of the overdraft to 31 January 1994 and approved an
increase in the overdraft of $1,050,000 pending
clearance from deferred cattle
sales.  It also extended the timeframe for property sales under consideration
to 31 January 1994.
<P>

587   	The diary note of Davis of 6 January 1994 noted
favourable variance from budget in relation to livestock sales and observed
that the "[r]eason for selling additional 634 head which partly represents
cattle earmarked for December sales is due to current
good prices being
achieved and feed at Boonaldoon is dwindling".
<P>

588   	Although the evidence disclosed that the group's
properties were being adversely affected by drought for most of the period
prior to the group's account being put into default, there were vicissitudes in
the weather pattern and, in the last quarter of 1993,
Boonaldoon was enjoying
favourable early summer seasonal conditions, in contrast with the tableland
properties which had not been
so favoured.  
<P>

589   	By year's end, the bank had become aware through sources
outside Wright's circle that Shaw was not immediately interested
in a joint
venture arrangement, although maintaining an interest in Kindon.  I doubt
whether Wright was fully aware of this.  However,
the dissolving of Shaw's
interest in the joint venture proposal could only have had an adverse impact on
the bank's attitude to the
deferral of property sale.  
<P>

590   	At the beginning of 1994, the group account came under
the administration of the department of the bank which was concerned
with
"asset management" with Daraius Bilimoria (Bilimoria) assuming responsibility
for the day to day dealings with the group account.
 He reported to Mark Sample
(Sample) who was the senior manager in asset management.  Bilimoria was
assisted by Pidcock and Malcolm
Ferdenanz.  The group account remained in that
administration within the bank until 10 May 1995 when it was transferred to the
corporate
banking department with Ralph Allen (Allen) becoming responsible for
its administration, reporting to the senior manager in business
banking,
Geoffrey Kevin Bond Pilley (Pilley).  The evidence of Sample as to the transfer
of the account to asset management, was
that this was a consequence of the
downgrading of the group account to "C2".  
<P>

591   	This period, during which the group account was under the
control of group credit management, was marked by prolonged negotiations
between the group and Bankers Trust Australia Ltd (Bankers Trust) aimed at
gaining access to equity capital and the reduction of
debt.  It involved the
transfer of the group's assets into a vehicle for the purpose of raising
capital by way of a public float
of shares.  
<P>

592   	The period opened with the Wrights' presentation of this
proposal to the bank, the Shaw negotiations having lapsed.  The
period ended
with the demise of the Bankers Trust proposal and its replacement in April 1995
with a similar proposal under the auspices
of Prudential-Bache Securities
(Australia) Ltd (Prudential-Bache) which involved "a private placement" with
Rural Property Trust
(the trust<b>)</b>.  That proposal involved the
`injection' of the group's assets into the trust and the undertaking of the
management of the trust's
rural assets by the Wrights.  It is, I think,
something of a tribute to the group's persistence that at the meeting of 10 May
1995
between Wright, David Wright, Pilley, Bilimoria, Allen and Pidcock, the
Wrights opened up the possibility of the bank financing the
group's acquisition
of units in the trust:  a proposal that met with no favour by the bank.  
<P>

593   	These negotiations were the basis upon which Wright
sought deferment of property and livestock sales, particularly any part
of the
breeding herd, so as not to jeopardise fulfilment of the proposals under
discussion.  There were numerous meetings between
the Wrights and the bank's
representatives during this period which I have found unnecessary to note in
any detail.  There is a lack
of accord in the evidence of the two camps upon
the content of those discussions, particularly in relation to references by the
Wrights
to the 1988 strategy, the failure of the bank to support the group and
the bank's requirement to sell cattle forming part of the
breeding herd.  I
prefer to treat those differences of recollection on the basis of the degree of
emphasis placed upon those matters
in discussions; the need to approach the
Wrights' evidence of conversations as conveying the substance of communications
rather than
the detail of them and the heavy dependence of the recollection of
bank officers upon contemporaneous records.  The period was marked
by the sale
of Kindon and efforts to dispose of the coastal property at South West Rocks.

<P>

594   	There is some support for the Wrights' evidence in David
Wright's letter to Bilimoria of 20 September 1994 which provided
the draft
financials for the 1994 year.  In that letter, he acknowledged the need for
debt reduction in the following terms:
<P>

"Accumulated losses in recent years and subsequent borrowing levels has
resulted in a situation where the gearing of the enterprise
means it is highly
vulnerable to movements in commodity prices, interest rates and the effect of
drought.  This fact has been apparent
to both ourselves and the ANZ for some
time.  As a consequence, major asset rationalisation has already occurred and
additional debt
reduction is necessary for the enterprise to safely service
it's (sic) liabilities and reduce debt through normal trading activity."
<P>

595   	The 1988 change in the group's strategy was described in
the following terms and does not appear to have been challenged
by the bank at
the time:
<P>

"A decision taken in 1988 to move from a breeding and fattening enterprise to
breeding only, has seen growth in breeding females
rise from 8500 at the
beginning of '88 to 20,000 at the end of this calendar year.  This decision,
made with the support of the Bank,
forecast a reduction in cashflow whilst
female offspring were retained to enable this growth to occur."
<P>

596   	Of further interest is David Wright's further comment in
relation to the breeding herd:  a comment which sits uncomfortably
beside a
forced sale of females as a result of the bank's debt reduction
requirements:
<P>

"Despite the effects of the drought and contrary to the majority of other
cattle operations, P.A. Wright &amp; Sons has been able
to maintain very high
fertility levels, achieve substantial market premiums for it's (sic) livestock
at the time of sale and has
significantly increased the size of it's (sic)
breeding herd."
<P>

597   	A further statement which I find difficult to reconcile
with a forced sale of the breeding herd is the comment by Hudson
in his letter
to Bilimoria of 10 November 1994, forwarding review of the group's cashflow
forecast which noted as follows:
<P>

"We should also point out at this time that despite some incidental losses as a
consequence of the drought, we have been fortunate
to have been able to
maintain our breeding herd intact.  We anticipate that once the drought breaks,
our breeding herd will be invaluable
due to the desire of others to restock
their properties ...".
<P>

598   	The bank's response to that communication was a facsimile
from Bilimoria of 14 November 1994 which sought information concerning
the
"Number of cattle (not including breeding herd) that are available for sale now
and approximate price".  I think that response
is indicative of the bank's
acknowledgment of the undesirability of forcing a sale of livestock including
productive females.  
<P>

599   	I am not satisfied that the bank specifically called upon
the sale of part of the group's breeding herd as distinct from
seeking to
obtain reduction of debt which necessarily involved a sale of livestock.  I
think it is reasonably clear from the evidence
that the business banking sector
was mindful of the futility of indiscriminate sale of female livestock to
reduce debt, having regard
to the adverse mid to long term impact on cashflow
through depleted sale of progeny.  
<P>

600   	In my view, the bank's treatment of the group account in
this period was reasonable, given the deferment of sales of properties
other
than Kindon and South West Rocks and the granting of additional overdraft
facilities in the third quarter of the year of $1,200,000
until 15 February
1995.  
<P>

601   	I think, so far as it was consistent with his duties to
the bank, Bilimoria supported the group's objectives.  The Wrights
acknowledged
that on a number of occasions. 
<P>

602   	David Wright observed to the bank on 8 May 1994 that with
"the bank's support, and despite the impact of drought and resulting
impact on
profitability, the enterprise is now one of the 20 largest beef cattle
producer's (sic) in Australia and arguably has the
most fertile and productive
herd".
<P>

603   	In David Wright's letter of 20 September 1994, referred
to above, he concluded with the following remark:
<P>

"To date and fortunately for us, the Bank has always taken a long term view of
our business, the quality of the assets and the integrity
of the
principals."
<P>

604   	In his further letter to the bank of 23 September 1994 he
commented in the following terms:
<P>

"We wish to sincerely thank you for the flexibility and support provided by the
Bank during this difficult time and are most pleased
to accept your offer of a
temporary increase in Overdraft Facility ...  We cannot emphasise enough how
grateful we are for the Bank's
understanding under the current circumstances.
We are fully aware of the issues you have raised in your letter ... Once again
thankyou
for your invaluable support and cooperation."
<P>

605   	Much the same sentiments were expressed by Wright in his
letter of 21 December 1994 as follows:
<P>

"First of all, let me say how appreciative we are of your cooperation and the
Bank's continuing support to the organisation during
these difficult times."
<P>

606   	They were "difficult times", for the most part severely
affected by drought.  The difficulties were exacerbated by the failure
of the
Kindon winter crop.  
<P>

607   	Further, on 25 January 1995, Wright responded to
Bilimoria's letter of 23 December 1994 by once again expressing the group's
"gratitude for the continued cooperation and support from the Bank" emphasising
his "determination to substantially reduce debt levels
over the course of
1995".  
<P>

608   	Although I think it would be unreasonable to take those
statements literally, given the financially precarious position of
the group, I
do think that they are an indication of the tone of the approach by the Wrights
to the bank in meetings during this
period which may go a long way to
explaining the failure of the bank's officers to recall some of the more
critical comments made
by Wright during those meetings in relation to the
bank's support of the group in the previous two or three years.  
<P>

609   	I think the relationship between the bank and the group
during this period is captured in Sample's handwritten comment on
Bilimoria's
diary note of 7 June 1994 in which the latter recommended an extension of the
time for the reduction of the overdraft
facility to July 1994.  Sample's
comment follows:
<P>

"Extension to 15/7 <u>NOT</u> to be advised to PAWS - Pressure to be kept
<u>ON</u>."
<P>

610   	Briefly tracing the history of dealings between the
parties in that period of control of the group account by group credit
management:  the bank submitted a draft of proposed facilities letter on 14
February 1994 and followed that up with a formal letter
of 4 March 1994 which
confirmed an increase in the overdraft of $900,000 essentially on the strength
of the then current discussions
with Bankers Trust which had confirmed its
interest in merging operations with the Wright group by letter of 7 March 1994.
In line
with that approach, the bank agreed to a revised timetable for the
planned sale of Boonaldoon and some 7,000 head.  
<P>

611   	Wright's letter of 24 March 1994 confirmed that strategy
and anticipated that board approval of the proposed Bankers Trust
float "should
be available by 31.5.94 at the latest".  As I read that letter, it envisaged
the sale by the end of June or early July
of 7,900 head which did not include
any females required for breeding.  The letter concluded with a caveat on that
program that the
group would need to be convinced that the float option did not
remain a possibility in the short to medium term.  Given the escape
hatch that
that caveat represented to a program of sale of assets, I think it was a little
surprising that it was accepted by the
bank as "a suitable letter" and "as per
(the bank's) requirements".  
<P>

612   	On 28 April 1994 the Kindon property passed into the
hands of Bankers Trust.  In mid 1994, another proposal presented to
the bank by
Wright involved the transfer of the group's assets into the trust with a
request for the bank to provide additional facilities
in the form of bridging
finance to enable the group to purchase sufficient units in the trust to head
off any other competitor in
the market.  The outcome of that proposal was, I
think, predictable.  The trust proposal was said to have "evolved over the past
six months with the encouragement of Prudential-Bache".  Bankers Trust was also
said to be interested in this proposal.
<P>

613   	The asset management strategy report of 8 July 1994
reviewed the then current strategy, noting it as one partly agreed with
the
group.  It recorded the sale of Kindon, the failure to sell the South West
Rocks property at auction and outlined a scheme which
gave the group until the
end of July to pursue the Bankers Trust proposals.  
<P>

614   	Hudson's monthly report dated 14 July 1994, reporting for
the month of May, referred to the sale of some 1,669 head at prices
averaging
$333.30 per head.  In like terms was his report of 10 August 1994 for the month
of June, noting the sale of 2,109 head
averaging $311.99.  A follow-up letter
of Hudson of 24 August 1994, after a meeting with the Wrights and the bank in
Armidale on
18 August, enclosed the group's forecast cashflows.  In commenting
on those forecasts, Hudson noted that "the 3,299 empty cows scheduled
for sale
in February, 1995 following the planned sale of Boonaldoon (were) not included
in the Sales Forecast ... These females (were)
currently unjoined and almost
unsaleable owing to drought.  It (was) intended to mate them prior to their
proposed sale in February,
thereby more than doubling their current value".
These forecasts he observed were "in the unlikely event that the BT proposal
...
does not proceed".  
<P>

615   	It was at this time that the bank became aware that the
Bankers Trust interest in the proposal under discussion with the
Wrights had
waned.  In addition, the pressure upon the group was heightened by the severe
drought conditions which were noted, in
relation to Boonaldoon, as involving
the lowest annual rainfall for 120 years.
<P>

616   	Bilimoria's diary note of 30 August 1994 recorded his
acceptance of the fact that the "ability (of the group) to generate
cashflows
and future profitability (was) wholly dependent upon maintaining their breeding
herd".  His recommendation was that the
bank "assist the customer" and he
observed that the bank "would not wish to be seen to be forcing cattle sales
under the present
circumstances".   His recommendation involved increasing the
overdraft by $1,200,000 up to mid February 1995, a recommendation which
was
accepted by the credit sector.  The negotiations with Bankers Trust collapsed
with a letter from Bankers Trust to Wright of 10
October 1994.
<P>

617   	In the following month, there was an inspection by bank
officers of Boonaldoon which underlined the struggle the group faced
with the
prevailing drought conditions.  It was noted that the property was barren and
that there were some 1,100 head of cattle
and 5,000 sheep being handfed and
2,500 head on the stock route.  Hudson's letter to the bank of 18 November 1994
recorded that the
drought affected the New England properties along with
Boonaldoon.
<P>

618   	I think of particular interest in that letter is Hudson's
recognition of the need to dispose of stock in the face of continuing
drought
conditions given the cost of handfeeding.  He expressed the opinion that
"should the drought not be over in (the New England)
region by the end of
March, 1995, when the New England Tablelands growing season normally finishes,
we would not have sufficient
grass to carry all the stock through the late
Autumn and Winter months.  We would be forced to substantially destock the
properties
irrespective of the price and condition of stock".  He anticipated
that this "decision (would) be reached well before the end of
June, and (the
group) would commence a selling program from late March".  
<P>

619   	In the knowledge that drought conditions did persist in
1995, the sale of livestock in that year should, in my view, be considered
in
the context of that opinion.
<P>

620   	I endeavoured to elicit from Wright whether the group
possessed a rule of thumb policy in relation to the retention of stock
in the
face of mounting and continuing cost effects of drought.  I was unsuccessful in
eliciting any clear evidence of such a policy.
 However, I think, as a matter
of logic, there has to come a time in an enterprise such as that conducted by
the group, when the
cost of maintaining a herd in drought conditions outweighs
any other consideration so as to dictate recourse to forced sales.  In
expressing that view, I am mindful of the evidence that the group had developed
a core herd which was considered to be superior to
that available from the
group's competitors.  That factor, I think, may only be taken so far.
<P>

621   	Hudson's monthly report for December recorded no sales of
any consequence and I think by year's end the group had successfully
managed to
defer sales of further properties and to avoid excessive forced sale of
livestock, notwithstanding severe drought conditions.
 However, in the bank's
letter of 15 December 1994 varying the facilities by the provision of a
temporary increase in the overdraft
of $1,000,000, it was noted in relation to
Boonaldoon that the bank "would wish to see the property placed on the market
as soon
as improvement in conditions (was) evident."  
<P>

622   	The period from December 1994 to the end of group credit
management's control of the group account was marked by a series
of revisions
by the bank of facility requirements.  That ending coincided with a meeting
held on 10 May 1995 in which the Wrights
brought forward an inauspicious
proposal that the bank provide further funding of $3,100,000 to permit the
group to invest in the
trust proposal advanced by Prudential-Bache.  It appears
that the bank was prepared to take cognisance of the proposal to the extent
that it accepted that Boonaldoon may not be sold prior to mid year, while
cautioning that the Prudential-Bache proposal "should not
be used to delay any
cattle sales past June and consequent debt reduction by 30/6".  
<P>

623   	Given the strategy of asset sales, including sale of
Boonaldoon, recommended in the James reports and the group's acceptance,
in
principle, of that situation, the group had successfully staved off sale on the
strength of negotiations involving Bankers Trust
and Prudential-Bache and by
gaining bank recognition of the difficulty of marketing Boonaldoon in the depth
of drought conditions.
<P>

624   	Between 10 May 1995 and 2 February 1996 the group account
came back to business banking when the day to day administration
of the account
became the responsibility of Allen, who reported directly to Pilley.  At that
time credit restrictions on the group
account were subject to the control of
Ron Miller (Miller) who was regional credit executive.  He assumed conduct of
the accounts
as the senior officer to Pilley and Allen.  
<P>

625   	The group account was put into default with the group's
inability to comply with the bank's demand of 2 February 1996 to
pay the
interest instalment of $242,934.34 due on 5 February 1996.  At the time of that
notice, the group's overdraft facility was
in an excess position and the group
had little prospect of meeting the demand.  
<P>

626   	During this period, notwithstanding an agreed strategy to
reduce debt by orderly sale of assets, the only property sale that
was effected
was the sale of South West Rocks for $550,000, settled on 18 May 1995.  For the
most part during this period the group
struggled under the continued
debilitating effect of drought upon the rural property market, upon the market
value of livestock and
upon the physical condition of both livestock and
properties.  
<P>

627   	There were numerous meetings between the parties during
this time.  The subject matter of discussion at those meetings in
my view was
not particularly noteworthy in the context of the issues in this case.  The
group successfully staved off the sale of
Boonaldoon, the principal target for
sale, largely by recourse to dealings with Rabobank with the objective of
refinancing the group's
borrowings and by continuation of proposals involving
the group's investment in the trust.
<P>

628   	In relation to the Rabobank negotiations, it appears that
in mid 1995 those approaches looked like resulting in the provision
of a long
term facility of $36,000,000.  However, by mid July 1995, that proposal appears
to have fallen down.  
<P>

629   	The Wrights also retained consultants, Bird Cameron
Partners, who explored alternative asset disposal propositions on behalf
of the
group.  I think it is an understatement to say that their efforts were singly
unattractive to those bank officers engaged
in overseeing some debt reduction
strategy. 
<P>

630   	Although a tight rein was held by the bank over the
group's finances during this period, the bank, nevertheless, provided
temporary
increases in overdraft at various times during the year and progressively
extended times for reduction of overdraft.  By
year's end, the overdraft
facility had increased to $5,700,000.  
<P>

631   	It is evident from the diary note of Allen of 22 May 1995
that there was a growing hardening of the bank's attitude to the
group account
and to the deferral of asset sales.  The diary note was circulated to Pilley,
Miller, Buckley and Lucas.  In relation
to Allen's proposal to adopt a "firmer
tone", Miller noted "I would suggest an iron fist".  At the same time, I think
it is clear
from Allen's diary note and the comments upon it by other bank
officers that the aim was "to leave the group with a viable operation
based
around the "home" properties".  At that stage, the core assets were seen as
consisting of "Wallamumbi, Forglen/Conningdale/part
Thorpleigh" with an
estimated realisation on sales of $30,000,000.  Other records suggested that
the core assets included Achill.
 However, of that strategy it was generally
recognised that "while a sell down to a viable structure (was) possible, it
(was) not
certain, due to the erosion of equity that has taken place while the
client has resisted taking action."  To that Miller had noted:
 "However sell
down is now necessary".  
<P>

632   	The general position of the bank was summarised as
follows:
<P>

"<u>Summary</u>
<P>

The credit has deteriorated and is no longer an automatic "hold".
<P>

The Bank thus far has not taken any meaningful steps to protect its position.
We do not wish to increase our exposure on speculative
ventures such as
investment in RPT units.
<P>

A structured sales programme may leave a viable operation based around the core
properties.
<P>

This should be reconfirmed by Geoff James of Ernst &amp; Young.
<P>

Split banking that leaves us with the same risk profile is unacceptable.
<P>

The Bank should indicate its continued willingness to support the client
through a sales programme but indicate it is a firm requirement.
 If the group
does not wish to proceed along this path, it should seek refinance and/or we
will undertake legal process."
<P>

633   	Allen's concern with the viability of the proposed "sell
down programme ... over an extended period" was that "if the current
conditions
(prevailed, the bank) could be faced with further increases in debt of at least
$1M p.a. and no certainty in the properties
being sold and at acceptable
prices".  
<P>

634   	Allen saw the strategy of selected asset sales in the
context of the James reports in the following terms:
<P>

"It is noted that we hold investigating accountant's reports which clearly show
that the group is not viable given volatilities
in price, seasons and interest
rates; over the past twelve months debt has escalated substantially."
<P>

635   	I think the significance in the change of control of the
group account in May 1995 is caught in the following comment of
Allen in
relation to the bank's strategy under consideration:
<P>

"To this end as a new team without any loyalties to the client we can insist on
a workout strategy which must meet agreed targets."
<P>

636   	The strategy was taken up in the letter from the bank to
Wright of 24 May 1995 which envisaged the sale of Boonaldoon by
31 August and
with the property being "placed formally with an agent by 30th June".  As
earlier noted, that sale was progressively
deferred during 1995.  
<P>

637   	In keeping with Wright's strategy of deferring property
sale pending the outcome of the group's proposals involving third
parties, the
group achieved deferment of cattle sales in mid year.  Forecast sales provided
for only 313 head being sold in July
with further sales deferred to
August/September.  Miller's response to the deferment of sale was recorded in
his note of 25 July
1995 which included the following:
<P>

"The essential reason why little has been achieved on the debt reduction side
is failure to set and stick to deadlines and face
the hard options when the
borrowers ignored conditions.  Customers have been left to control the
situation and us.
<P>

Whilst it makes no sense to force sales at the wrong time of the year or in
drought conditions where large capital losses result,
it does make sense to
test the market formally when conditions are suitable.  The latter is the case
now with Boonaldoon and Yarrowyck
and we must not let borrowers off the hook
this time.  A tender is appropriate here not an auction in the first instance
as it is
more flexible and likely to bring out genuine buyers.  The option of
unlimited time to achieve ... sales is not on!"
<P>

638   	Increased overdraft facilities were provided in the
bank's letter of offer of 31 August 1995 which increased the overdraft
to
$5,000,000.  It was at about this time that Bird Cameron Partners appeared on
the scene and as far as I have been able to ascertain,
they remained until
shortly prior to the bank's letter of demand in February 1996.
<P>

639   	As previously noted, it was somewhat ironic that the
attempted marketing of Boonaldoon was frustrated in late 1995 with the
incidence of rain in November causing an extension of the sale date to 22
December 1995.  There was a further delay in the sale of
Boonaldoon attributed
to the failure to clear with the authorities approval of certain development
activities considered necessary
to enhance the value of Boonaldoon.  That was
referred to as the "SEPP 46" submission which was required to obtain approval
for land
clearing, in this instance for cropping purposes.
<P>

640   	The relationship closed on a sour note.  A meeting of 24
January 1996 was arranged at the request of Wright between consultants
retained
by the group, Beerworth &amp; Partners Ltd, Allen and Buckley to explore the
possibility of repayment of the bank debt "at
a discount to its face value" or
"to see if there was a possibility of pursuing ... other refinancing options".
In the course of
the approach, the consultants apparently submitted a document
described as "Investment Opportunity" which was dismissed by Buckley
on the
basis that the consultants' "time would be better spent "practising (their)
golf swing"."  
<P>

641   	Much the same attitude was adopted by Buckley in the very
little time that he afforded the Wrights at their requested meeting
with him
and Allen on the afternoon of 5 February 1996.  There may be some disagreement
as to the comments that passed on that occasion,
but there was little
disagreement, I think, in terms of the attitude adopted by Buckley to the
Wrights.  
<P>

642   	It was following that meeting that the bank notified the
group by letter of 6 February 1996 of an `Event of Default' requiring
the group
to remedy the default by 8 February 1996, failing which, the group was notified
that the bank would be entitled to terminate
the bank's obligations and declare
all outstanding amounts due and payable.
<P>

643   	I think it should be recognised that the approach I have
adopted to the issues in this matter embrace what I consider is
the most
favourable basis for examination of the group's case, howsoever pleaded.  For
the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that
no case of actionable representation
sounding in equitable compensation or damages has been substantiated by the
group.  Further,
I am satisfied that the group suffered no expectation losses
which call for quantification and that any amendment of the group's
pleadings
to found a case in contract, would be futile.
<P>

644   	In relation to quantum issues, there may be some utility
in the identification of the approaches which should be adopted
had different
conclusions on liability been reached.  
<P>

645   	An underlying problem in addressing those issues arises
out of the fact that at the commencement of the proceedings the parties
were
still in the process of preparing statements of evidence on quantum. 
<P>

646   	To forestall some of the difficulties related to that
situation, directions were given on 9 September 1998 in the following
terms:
<P>

"In the case of the subject matter of the reports of Messrs James, Black and
Cox, I direct the experts to confer forthwith and to
produce by 4pm, 14
September 1998 a joint report including the following:
<P>

1.	Accepting the assumptions the other has made, the experts are to identify
their agreement upon the accuracy or validity of the
calculations and
conclusions so  reached and where there is disagreement identifying that
disagreement and the reason therefore;
<P>

2.	In respect of assumptions made or methodology adopted by the other, each
expert should identify the areas of agreement in relation
to those matters, and
where there is disagreement identifying that disagreement and the reasons
therefore;
<P>

3.	Finally, in bullet form, a schedule should be produced identifying the
perceived deficiencies in each other's reports and the
consequences of those
deficiencies, including monetary consequences when it is practicable to do
so.
<P>

In the case of Messrs Guinness, Black, Hatton and Evans, I direct that a joint
report is produced in the same manner and form as
that set out in relation to
the joint report of Messrs James, Black and Cox, noting that it will not be
necessary for the final reports
of each of those experts to be available prior
to the commencement of joint conferencing which, as I have directed, is to take
place
forthwith.
<P>

By way of explanation, I think it is preferable to proceed to a joint report,
notwithstanding the incompletion of the preparation
of opinion evidence by one
or other of the experts, particularly where the form of the joint report
envisaged will overtake the necessity,
I think, to produce final reports other
than the joint report.
<P>

In the case of Messrs Fitzgerald and Watson, I give similar directions to the
foregoing.
<P>

In the case of Messrs Gardiner and Stewart, the same.
<P>

In the case of Messrs Button and Rowlands the same, noting that the latter's
report is the only in draft stage."
<P>

647   	That direction resulted in several joint reports being
incorporated into what became Ex AS and Ex 59.  I think that exercise
of joint
reporting was of considerable assistance in the evaluation of points of
differences in the respective approaches adopted
by the parties' experts.
Where it was unsuccessful was in the failure to head off the tendering of
further reports by both parties
after the preparation of Ex AS. 
<P>

648   	That resulted in objection being taken by the bank to
some of the statements of evidence tendered in the group's case  on
the basis
of prejudice arising out of the lateness of serving those statements.  There
were several such statements objected to and
the procedure I adopted was to
admit the statements with the view to reconsidering the objection in the light
of any prejudice to
the bank that survived my reasons for judgment.  I am
satisfied that there is no prejudice to the bank in the admitting of those
statements, given my findings on liability.  If it should ever become necessary
to revisit quantum issues, the bank will have ample
opportunity to meet the
subject evidence admitted in the group's case.  That approach, however,
precludes me from making ultimate
findings which are dependent upon that
material.  
<P>

649   	Furthermore, I think the nature of the group's case makes
it impractical to second guess which of the permutations or combinations
of
claims may ever require further examination:  particularly where there is
interrelationship amongst the major elements of claim.
<P>

650   	The group's losses were quantified as the minimum equity
to which the group was entitled.  The `minimum equity' was measured
on the
premise that the group would not have embarked upon its expansion plan and
change in herd strategy, with the attendant ballooning
of debt, had the bank
not represented that repayment would be governed by the group's cashflow and
its maintenance of an adequate
security cover.  
<P>

651   	The claimed relief was summarised as follows:
<P>

"<b><i>Summary</i></b>
<P>

Capital loss on Boonaldoon plant
<P>

    and equipment						       $ 777,318
<P>

Expenditure on improving Boonaldoon			       $ 257,739
<P>

Loss resulting from the acquisition of Melrose			    $ 1,663,794
<P>

Cost of borrowing with respect to the 
<P>

   post-1988 strategy					  $ 20,380,131
<P>

Loss of profits						    $ 4,294,849
<P>

Loss arising from the sale of South West Rocks
<P>

   and Kindon						       $ 440,065
<P>

Cost of restoration of the PAWS' properties			  $ 12,572,000
<P>

Loss arising from entering fixed-rate loan 
<P>

   for Boonaldoon						    $ 1,333,481
<P>

Total							  $ 41,796,685
<P>

<b><u>Plus</u></b>
<P>

Damages comprising expectation loss with respect
<P>

   to the Coles' contract - to be ascertained; and interest 
<P>

   on the above losses where appropriate."
<P>

652   	The claim for "[l]oss arising from entering fixed-rate
loan" is without any merit, in my view, and little was heard of it
at the
conclusion of the case.  It was based upon the bank's allegedly negligent
advice that favoured the provision of a fixed rate
of interest loan, as opposed
to a variable rate, to assist in the acquisition of Boonaldoon.  
<P>

653   	Earlier in these reasons I have noted the extensive
business activities of Wright, his comparatively wide business experience
beyond the narrow confines of a grazing enterprise and his recourse to
consultants and social contacts of commercial prominence to
assist him in the
formulation of views about such things as movement in interest rates.  
<P>

654   	Wright acknowledged, during the course of his evidence,
the vagaries of the interest rate market.  While it is clear that
the bank
provided Wright with information concerning that market, I think it is
unrealistic to seek to impose upon the bank the adverse
consequences of a
commercial decision by the group based upon a prediction of the possible
movement in the cost of borrowing.  
<P>

655   	In the quantification of loss, the group, initially,
sought compensation on what may be described as a complete indemnity
basis,
making no allowance for an analysis based upon a reduction of debt within a
reasonable time of becoming aware that the bank
support upon which it relied
was no longer available to it.  
<P>

656   	James, in his report of 20 July 1998 (the James 20 July
report), raised an issue of importance in the proceedings by making
an
assumption that, upon the group being made aware of the bank's attitude to the
group account in the first half of 1991, it should
have acted immediately to
reduce debt by the sale of Boonaldoon, together with its related stock, plant
and machinery.  On this basis,
he reduced the claim for cost of borrowing to
$3,010,147 and allowed nothing in respect of the claim for lost profit.
<P>

657   	As I think I indicated to James during the course of his
evidence, the bail out date of 30 June 1991 was quite unrealistic
on any
reasonable approach to the evidence.  However, I am equally satisfied that in
the face of the communication by the bank of
21 June 1991, and the
confrontation with Buckley of 1 August 1991, the group could not have been left
in any doubt that the bank
support, as they understood it, was no longer
available to it.  
<P>

658   	The most obvious step to be taken involved the disposal
of Boonaldoon and its related livestock and plant and equipment.
 A consequence
of that action, as a matter of practicality, I think, involved pulling out of
negotiations with Coles at the end of
the one year supply contract, or, at
least, treating the supply arrangement as at an end as at 1 April 1992, leaving
only the sale
of livestock in the Coles pipeline to be completed.  
<P>

659   	Partly, I think, at my instigation during the course of
the proceedings, a series of analyses were then carried out by James
and Stuart
Alexander Black (Black), a partner in a firm of chartered accountants
practising as Chapman &amp; Eastway.  On a variety
of bases, these analyses
assumed sales as at 30 June 1992 and other dates through to the actual sale of
Boonaldoon in 1996.  It was
what the Black analyses described as scenarios 3.2,
3-2A, 3.3 and 3-3A which drew the objection of the bank on the grounds of
prejudice
arising out of their late formulation.  The report was admitted as Ex
72 on the basis earlier noted that I would re-examine the question
of prejudice
in the context of my findings on the issue of liability.
<P>

660   	While no prejudice has resulted to the bank in the
admitting of that evidence, it is clear that no ultimate findings should
be
made as to quantum based on that material prior to the bank being given the
opportunity of addressing that material.  However,
I think it is open to me to
say that I consider the Black analyses, noted as versions 4, 6, 3.2 and 3-2A,
indicate the range of analyses
indicative of the effect of a minimum bail out
which I consider the Wrights were obliged to undertake, they being analyses
predicated
on the sale of Boonaldoon in 1992, adjusted for the actual sales of
Kindon and South West Rocks (analysis 4); a similar bail out
with Boonaldoon
being sold in mid 1993 (analysis 4, 3.2 and 3-2A).  On each of those bases,
Black estimated that the earning before
interest and taxation would have been
increased and he estimated the debt level in relation to the value of security
as being within
reasonable limits.  
<P>

661   	However, in carrying out those analyses, Black relied
upon the valuations of George Bruce Gunning (Gunning) and of Terrence
Stewart
(Stewart).  In the case of the Stewart valuation, Ex AS, the joint report
provided a comparison between his valuations of
the group's New England
properties and the valuations of Robin Gardiner (Gardiner).  Stewart's
valuations were approximately double
those of Gardiner, if one was to take into
account Stewart's "premium" which he applied to the "total holding" of the
group.  That
brought his total valuation to $34,500,000 compared with
Gardiner's total of $17,075,000.
<P>

662   	I think it is sufficient to say that of the two
valuations, Stewart's were the most favourable that could be placed upon
the
group's properties, ascribing to those valuations the full effect of the
claimed DSE capacity of the properties.  That can be
measured by his use of a
DSE equivalent of 219,670 as compared with Gardiner's 128,450.  I think the
group's estimated DSE involved
considerable stock pressure on the group's
properties which would be capable of supporting that capacity only through
vigilant improvement
of pastures.  While those estimates were on the high side,
I would be prepared to act on the group's estimate of the carrying capacity
of
its properties.
<P>

663   	Moreover, I think Stewart has probably placed too high a
value on the DSE value of the properties which has resulted in a
valuation
range of $1,299 to $1,945 per hectare for Wallamumbi.  In substance, those
valuations are not supported by comparable sales.
 At the same time, if it came
to the point of assessing the group's loss, I would favour the general approach
of Stewart based on
the enhanced carrying capacity of the group's properties
and reflecting, in part, the status of the group's properties and of its
livestock in the industry.  Still, a significant discount would be called for
to give some expression to what I think is the extreme
of the range of
reasonable valuations which his valuations represent.  I would not regard 20%
as too heavy a discount, given the
range of property sales evidenced by
Gardiner.  
<P>

664   	When that discount is built into the Black analyses, I
think it would bring into question the capacity of the enterprise
to sustain
the operation at the reduced level of debt as hypothesised by Black.  James has
not prepared an analysis which can be
compared directly with Black's analyses
3.2 or 3-2A, for the reasons earlier referred to.  He has prepared analyses
which may be
compared with analyses 4 and 6.  To the extent that different
modelling techniques have been used by those two experts, I prefer
to make no
finding, given the absence of a reasonable opportunity for the bank to fully
examine Black's modelling computer aid.
<P>

665   	While it is clear that the James' model, in principle, is
a reliable tool for an exercise of this kind, I have some difficulty
with the
comparative inflexibility of it as a "Steady State" model.  Further, I think
there are deficiencies in the model in terms
of the data base adopted by James
in using that computer tool, as more particularly identified in the joint
report, Ex AS.  
<P>

666   	In any revisiting of the quantum issues seeking
compensation in relation to cost of borrowing or loss of profits, I anticipate
a significant issue may arise as to the true cost of the group's dealings with
Coles.  If, contrary to my finding, it was held that
the group embarked upon
that commercial arrangement in reliance upon bank representations of financial
support as alleged by the
group, it is still difficult to see how that led to
any quantifiable loss during 1990 and 1991.  If one assumes that the commercial
arrangement was financially beneficial to the group, there should have been no
loss attributable to the bank's conduct.  As at the
end of 1991, the Wrights
should have been in a position to retire borrowings which had been obtained for
the purpose of purchasing
livestock for the Coles supply agreement.  The
persistence in negotiations after the one year supply agreement and any
decision involving
the supply of boxed beef to Coles at an unprofitable price,
were commercial decisions which, I think, are solely the responsibility
of the
group.  
<P>

667   	The restoration costs represent a major area of claim.
However, it is my view that, in the event that the group established
some bank
liability for the group's losses, the group still faces a considerable hurdle
in recovering restoration costs.  Essentially,
that is a claim based upon
several years of depletion and destruction of pastures and deterioration of
property and improvements
said to have been occasioned by the withdrawal of the
bank's support which resulted in the group being deprived of financial
resources
necessary for the maintenance and improvement of those properties.

<P>

668   	The difficulty with that aspect of the case lies in my
conclusion that by mid 1992, or at the latest mid 1993, the group
should have
effected a recovery of its expansion strategy by reverting, as far as
practicable, to its pre 1988 strategy.  
<P>

669   	On that basis, it is difficult to see what serious
deterioration of property and improvements would have been sustained.
 A
general and gradual catch up in maintenance works should have overcome any drop
in maintenance works that occurred in 1992-1993.
 I think that consideration
applies particularly to the application of fertiliser and seed for pasture
improvement. 
<P>

670   	In that context, I note that there is a conflict of
evidence of the discussion at the meeting between the Wrights and the
bank of
22 June 1992 concerning planned fertiliser application to the group's
properties.  It was the evidence of Wright that the
expenditure for fertiliser
had been dropped from the group's forecast at the suggestion of the bank.  The
diary note of that meeting
recorded the following:
<P>

"1993 budget does not include fertiliser expense which is 1992 cost, $662,000.
PAWS believe the super levels are satisfactory and
therefore to over super in
seasonally unfavourable conditions is uneconomic."
<P>

671   	Whatever the circumstance of the omission of the
application of fertiliser in the 1993 budget, the effect of that omission
would
have been readily redressed in the following year or years.  I think the
evidence is reasonably clear that the pastures were
doing reasonably well in
the dry conditions that were prevailing at the time of that meeting, such as to
avoid supplementary feeding
of livestock.  
<P>

672   	The principal witness in the group's case on restoration
costs was Dennis Leslie Watson (Watson), a highly qualified rural
consultant
who was retained to estimate the costs of restoring the group's properties to a
condition they would have been in had
they been subjected to prudent
maintenance and operating expenditures in the years following 1991.  In making
his assessment, Watson
relied upon the evidence of John Godby Weston (Weston),
who had extensive personal knowledge of the group's practices and testified
to
the high standard of management and maintenance adopted by the group.  I think
Weston's evidence should be accepted.  There has
been an attack on those
standards in the bank's case which, I think, lies very uncomfortably beside the
various reports obtained
by the bank from inspection of the group's properties
in years past, including very favourable observations in McMichael's report
to
James of 19 November 1992 following his inspection of the group's
properties.
<P>

673   	While I think the evidence leaves little room for doubt
that the group tested the capacity of its holdings to support livestock,
and
made shrewd use of the `long paddock', I am satisfied that the group's
properties were highly improved and capable of sustaining
an above average
carrying capacity.  As a corollary to that method of operation, I think it
follows that the properties stood to
be hard hit by a prolonged drought.
However, as reported by McMichael towards the end of 1992, the properties were
surviving well.
 Watson did not address improvements in the nature of buildings
or the condition of plant and equipment.  
<P>

674   	A builder, Paul Marquardt (Marquardt) reported on the
cost of restoration of improvements.  Marquardt's evidence bordered
on the
useless, not because of any failings of Marquardt as an expert, but by reason
of the irrelevant basis upon which he was retained
to carry out his costing
report.
<P>

675   	Watson's total estimated costs of restoration was
$16,113,200.  After allowance for maintenance costs which would have been
incurred in the ordinary course, the figure came down to $12,572,000.  Dr R D
Fitzgerald (Fitzgerald), an agricultural consultant
with considerable
experience in agricultural research, mainly in the field of pastures, made a
like analysis which allowed restoration
costs in the sum of $5,385,726, before
allowing for an adjustment for agistment, which brought his net costing down to
$3,825,726.
 
<P>

676   	The points of difference between the two are precisely
stated in appendix B to Ex AS.  In general terms, I think the significant
observation of Fitzgerald is that Watson's quantification amounts to $791 per
hectare which rather confirms the strong impression
given during the course of
Watson's evidence that his method of quantification reflected a `Rolls Royce'
approach to the task.  
<P>

677   	The bank relied upon the evidence of Dr Brian J Button
(Button), a professor in earth observation systems, whose counterpart
in the
group's case was Dr Nick Rollings, who possessed expertise in the field of
remote sensing techniques.  Both used satellite
imaging of the group's
properties to express views as to their state at the time of inspection of
analysis. 
<P>

678   	The bank's case was further supported by Anthony Jack
Guinness (Guinness), a rural management consultant with extensive experience
in
rural management.  His counterpart in the group's case was Dr David Evans.  The
approach of Guinness to the depleted state of
the group's properties is
reflected in the following passage from his report of 16 July 1998:
<P>

"It is acknowledged that PAWS were concerned about having to reduce expenditure
on fertiliser.  However, if it were a condition
of the Bank to reduce
discretionary expenditure - and fertiliser was viewed by PAWS in that
category, they had a number of options,
including (but not exhaustively):-
<P>

1)	Continuing to run 20,000 females and turning off young stock would have
required fertiliser/seed inputs.  As such it would be
reasonable to expect
PAWS, as a prudent manager, to advise the Bank that fertiliser was <u>an
essential</u>, and should not be treated as a discretionary expense.
<P>

2)	Reduce the program to the pre-1988 strategy and use part of all of the
proceeds from reduction in numbers to fund a fertiliser/seed
program.  (It is
noted that PAWS claimed that the value of the herd increased as a result of
implementing the strategy).
<P>

3)	Reduce the program to a point where there is equilibrium between pastures
and livestock which would require some maintenance
fertiliser applications.
<P>

From the evidence in the livestock analysis, PAWS continued their strategy of
20,000 cows.  In my opinion, this management decision
was fundamentally flawed
in that it had no regard to the obvious consequence of degradation of pastures
and ultimately economic unsustainability,
in a climatic environment which is
extremely variable."
<P>

679   	In my view, there is little difference between the
opposing sets of experts as to the state of the group's properties in
1998.
Fitzgerald, who conducted a three day inspection of the properties in June
1998, noticed that the pastures were "short, ranging
from almost bare ground
with only a cover of lichens", with a particularly low estimated yield of dry
and green matter.  This was
consistent with the evidence drawn from satellite
images.  I think the essential difference in approach reflected in the two
cases
lies in the attribution by the bank's experts of the degradation to
severe overgrazing, the result of poor management practices of
overstocking
during a prolonged drought.  In principle, I think the Guinness approach is
correct, in that there must come a time
in prolonged drought when it is
uneconomical to retain livestock.  To that extent, restoration costs as
assessed by Watson would
have to be discounted.
<P>

680   	While recognising that the above average quality of its
commercial herd may have dictated a decision by the group to retain
livestock,
I think the retention of the group's herd through a severe and prolonged
drought was dictated mainly by a combination
of a misplaced anticipation of an
early end to the drought and the desirability of retaining the herd while the
group endeavoured
to explore the availability of equity capital to relieve debt
pressure.  To that extent, property degradation should not be attributed
to the
conduct of the bank.  
<P>

681   	For those reasons, I am of the view that the relevant
time for considering any entitlement to restoration costs would be
limited to
the period ended 30 June 1993 at the latest:  that any degradation of pasture,
property or improvements could be gradually
accommodated in following years:
that the retention of the herd through the drought, though an understandable
commercial decision
by the group, nevertheless, was one the consequences of
which must rest with the group.
<P>

682   	The claim for capital loss and expenditure in relation to
the purchase and sale of Boonaldoon was predicated in the group's
case on the
assumption that the 1996 sale of Boonaldoon was the time when it was reasonable
for the group to divest itself of that
property and its related stock, plant
and equipment.  The claim is quantified on the basis that the group is entitled
to a "complete
indemnity" in relation to that loss.  However, as in the case of
the claim for restoration costs, I am of the view that any entitlement
to loss
arising out of the purchase and sale of Boonaldoon and its related stock and
equipment should be measured by a sale by 30
June 1992 or, at the latest, mid
1993.  
<P>

683   	This head of loss was supported by the evidence of
Phillip Charles Edmond Cox (Cox), a chartered accountant of considerable
experience in his profession.  He assessed the loss at $777,318, in addition to
$257,739 in the nature of unrecouped expenditure
by the group on Boonaldoon.
James accepted the methodology adopted for this calculation of loss and the
accuracy of the calculation.
 
<P>

684   	In the James 20 July report, James concluded that any
capital loss was attributable to the general decline in land values
in the
Moree district and to the effect of overstocking.  As at mid 1992, and possibly
1993, it is doubtful whether any devaluation
through overstocking would have
been in evidence or played a part in the sale price of Boonaldoon.  There was
evidence of a general
decline in values of wheat properties in the Moree
district of between 15% and 20% between 1990 and 1992.  However, I think the
approach
adopted by Cox is correct in comparing the total price on purchase and
sale, in each case, on the `walk in, walk out' basis.  In
the way in which the
group presented its `minimum equity' case, I would have regarded the movement
in land values evidenced by James
as no basis for discounting the loss as
calculated by Cox. 
<P>

685   	The Wrights' unrecouped expenditure on Boonaldoon falls
into a similar category.  James maintained that costs of that nature
should be
discounted on the basis that those expenses would be treated "as an outright
deduction or as depreciation" for taxation
purposes.  However, I do not regard
that as a factor to be taken into account in any assessment of compensation.

<P>

686   	The claim in respect of the Melrose loss, I think, is
insupportable.  The group's initial investment in Melrose took place
in 1987
prior to any change in group strategy.  In my view, the move by the group to
total shareholding in 1988 and 1989 was a decision
which flowed from that
initial involvement and was, in part, dictated by the commercial disadvantage
of having a minority shareholding
in an enterprise that was struggling
financially.  
<P>

687   	The evidence disclosed that from the Melrose financial
statements for the year ended 30 June 1988, and from losses recorded
in
management accounts to January 1989, there was a deficiency in shareholders'
funds of over $700,000 and trading losses were showing
no real signs of
abatement.  Clearly, I think the group made a commercial decision to stem that
flow by taking control of the business
substratum of the share investment. 
<P>

688   	The assessment of loss said to have been associated with
the sale of South West Rocks and Kindon is in a different category
to the sale
of Boonaldoon, in my view.  In substance, the Wrights' case is that the net
selling price of those interests is to be
measured against valuations of those
properties.  However, Cox, in his assessment of loss, used directors'
valuations.  In the case
of Kindon, the directors' valuation was said to be
based upon an "Independent Valuation 19 May 1991".  There was no such expressed
basis for the directors' evaluation of the South West Rocks property and I
would not regard that valuation as an acceptable measuring
stick for any loss
said to have been suffered by the group on sale.
<P>

689   	I have considerable doubt about that method of evaluation
of loss.  The group advanced a case of loss through forced sale.
 However, I
think that would call for some evidence of the long term value of these
properties against which could be measured the
prices obtained by the group
upon their sale.  
<P>

690   	In the case of Kindon, the 1991 valuation valued the
group's interest at $5,391,060 against which the contract price for
the group's
share represented $5,325,000.  In those circumstances, I would treat the sale
price as reflecting no measurable loss
attributable to a concept of forced
sale.
<P>

691   	I have referred to the manner in which I have treated the
admissibility of the Black report, Ex 72.  In the same category
is the
affidavit of Wright sworn 27 October  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%20Exch%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1998, Ex 62</a>, Watson's report of 30 October
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%20Exch%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1998, Ex 61</a>, and the report of Bruce Gunning of 18 September  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%20Exch%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1998, Ex 66.</a>
Without examining any element of prejudice that may have existed in the late
admission of that material, in the face of my findings
on liability, I am
satisfied that there was no surviving element of prejudice to the bank in the
manner in which that material has
been admitted.
<P>

692   	Accordingly, there is to be a judgment for the plaintiff
in the sum of $31,911,666.40, together with interest thereon.  I
will hear
argument, if necessary, on the date from which and the rate at which interest
is to be calculated.  
<P>

693   	The cross-claim is dismissed.  The defendants are to pay
the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings and of the cross-claim.
 I will hear
argument, if necessary, on the basis upon which costs are to be assessed.
<P>

694   	I make orders in terms of paragraphs 5, 5A, 6 and 7 of
the claims in the plaintiff's second amended summons, save that, in
relation to
paragraph 7, execution of any such writ shall be stayed pending the making of
final orders in relation to interest and
costs.  The parties are requested to
bring in short minutes of order in accordance with these reasons, together with
submissions
in respect of any outstanding matters.
