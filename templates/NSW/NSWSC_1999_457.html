<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore, revised 13 May 1999)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1	These matters have come before the Court by two summonses.  The first, in
matter 1984 of 1999, is a summons for orders with respect
to two proposed
schemes of arrangement relating to the plaintiff, Mirvac Limited (`Mirvac').
The second summons, in proceedings 2038
of 1999, is an application by Mirvac
Funds Limited (`MFL')  and Capital Property Management Limited (`CPML') for
judicial advice
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 63</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a> (NSW) with
respect to proposed amendments to the trust instruments of two unit trusts of
which those entities are respectively responsible
entities under the
Corporations Law. 
<P>

2	The two matters are connected because the two schemes of arrangement by
Mirvac and the amendments to the trust instruments relating
to MFL and CPML are
components of an overall proposal under which shareholders of Mirvac and
unitholders in the two trusts will either
become the holders of stapled
securities each comprising a consolidated share and a consolidated unit of each
trust, or they will
be cashed out in the process of implementation of the
proposal. Given the close connection between the two proceedings, I directed
yesterday that the proceedings be heard together and that evidence in each be
evidence in the other.
<P>

3	Mirvac has secured listing rule waivers from the Australian Stock Exchange
(`ASX'), by three letters dated 28 April 1999 which
are in evidence.  It has
given ASIC the opportunity to review the documentation in the manner required
by section 411(2) of the Corporations
Law.  ASIC has responded, by letter dated
yesterday, in a manner which satisfies me that it has had reasonable
opportunity to consider
the terms of the proposed schemes and the draft
explanatory memorandum, and to make submissions to the Court.  In fact the
letter
signifies that ASIC has chosen not to appear at the present hearing.
<P>

4	The two matters came before me yesterday ex parte (as one would expect), and
on an urgent basis. The parties wish to implement
the overall proposal by 30
June 1999, subject to the approval of shareholders and unitholders and (as
regards the schemes) the Court.
 In order to meet their timetable, the parties
asked the Court to make orders yesterday and I did so, after having the
opportunity
to consider the applications, and on the basis that I would deliver
my reasons for judgment this morning.
<P>

5	I propose to describe the overall proposal, then deal with the schemes of
arrangement for Mirvac and then the application for
judicial advice by the two
responsible entities.
<P>

	<b>Overall proposal</b>
<P>

6	Mirvac is an Australian listed company incorporated in New South Wales. It
has on issue approximately 218.8 million ordinary shares
and some variable
priced options which I will refer to as the VPOs.  Mirvac proposes two schemes,
one relating to its shares and
the other relating to the VPOs.
<P>

7	MFL and CPML are the responsible entities of two trusts, namely, , the Mirvac
Property Trust (`MPT') and the Capital Property
Trust (`CPT').  Mirvac, MPT and
CPT are proposing a merger by stapling securities of the three entities to form
the Mirvac Group.
In this context the stapling of securities means that the
constitutional documents of Mirvac and the two trusts will be amended in
such a
way that their securities cannot be transferred separately from one another,
and new securities cannot be created of one entity
without a matching creation
of securities of the other entities.   The `stapling' will have the effect that
each transfer of Mirvac
consolidated shares must be accompanied by a transfer
of an equal number of consolidated units in MPT and an equal number of
consolidated
units in CPT. In order to achieve that outcome, it is necessary to
restructure the securities of each entity so as to produce an
appropriate
weighting of each to the others.   This entails converting the existing
securities into new securities which are referred
to as `consolidated
securities' in the explanatory memorandum, and in the proposed amendments to
the constitutions by which stapling
is to be achieved.  The stapling will
remain in place until the first to occur of:
<P>

	(a) the commencement of the winding up of Mirvac, CPT or MPT;
<P>

	(b) Mirvac, CPT or MPT resolving by special resolution in general meeting and
in accordance with its constitution to terminate
the arrangement.
<P>

8	As a practical matter, this `merger' by the stapling of securities will have
the effect that instead of there being three entities
listed separately on the
ASX, connected by virtue of the fact that the responsible entity for each of
the two trusts is a subsidiary
of Mirvac, there will be a single economic
entity for listing purposes, namely Mirvac Group, and a single quoted security,
namely
the stapled security comprising a consolidated Mirvac share and a
consolidated trust unit of each of the two trusts.
<P>

9	The main implementation steps are as follows:
<P>

	(a) existing shares in Mirvac will be consolidated into new consolidated
shares, and contemporaneously existing units in CPT and
MPT will be
consolidated;
<P>

	(b) new consolidated securities will be issued by each of the three entities
to their security holders so that on completion of
the merger, each security
holder will hold an equal number of securities in each of Mirvac, CPT and MPT
respectively;
<P>

	(c) the three consolidated securities will be stapled to each other by means
of constitutional amendments in the manner which I
have described and the
composite stapled security will be quoted and traded on the ASX;
<P>

	(d) shareholders in Mirvac, and also unitholders in CPT and MPT, who elect not
to hold Mirvac Group stapled securities, or who
do not vote at the appropriate
shareholders' or unitholders' meetings, or who have registered addresses
outside Australia and New
Zealand, will receive cash for their existing
securities.
<P>

	<b>Share scheme</b>
<P>

10	As far as Mirvac and its shareholders are concerned, the proposal is to
achieve the merger by scheme of arrangement under section
411 of the
Corporations Law, because of the need to bind shareholders into an election
between stapled securities and cash, and the
perceived logistical and
administrative needs to deal with shareholders who do not respond or who have
addresses outside Australia
and New Zealand by providing them with cash only.
In concept, this is an appropriate case for the scheme mechanism to be used.
<P>

11	As one would except, there is an implementation deed to give effect to the
scheme and in this case the implementation deed covers
other aspects of the
merger relating to the two trusts.  Additionally in this case, there is a deed
of co-operation whereby Mirvac
and the two responsible entities agree with
respect to the future management of the merged entities.  
<P>

12	There is also an explanatory memorandum which serves (inter alia) as part of
the explanatory statement for the scheme.  The explanatory
memorandum includes
information about the VPO scheme as well as information about the restructure
of the two trusts. Somewhat unusually
there are three shorter documents which
are referred to as the overview documents for each of Mirvac and the two
trusts. These are
also in evidence. It is intended that each shareholder will
receive the explanatory memorandum together with the Mirvac overview,
and that
the two documents together will constitute the explanatory statement for the
share scheme. Unitholders of the respective
trusts will receive the explanatory
memorandum and the overview relevant to their trust. Unitholders in the VPO
scheme will receive
the explanatory memorandum and a separate VPO explanatory
memorandum, together constituting the explanatory statement for the VPO
scheme.
<P>

13	The explanatory memorandum sets out in detail some arrangements with respect
to the funding of the merged entities, which I shall
briefly describe below
when dealing with the VPO scheme, and arrangements for the sale of stapled
securities in order to pay out
those security holders who have opted for or are
required to take the cash alternative.
<P>

14	In this respect there is in evidence a cash alternative nominee deed poll
whereby Warburg Dillon Read Australian Equities Limited
agrees to act as a
nominee for the  purposes of the selling process.  I have reviewed the deed
poll and I am satisfied that it meets
the requirements briefly referred to by
Young J in <i>Re RGC Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2029%20ACSR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 29 ACSR 445</a>, 447. 
<P>

15	The selling process involves a procedure set out in the explanatory
memorandum and also in two bidding procedure manuals, both
of which are in
evidence.  The procedure involves what is colloquially referred to as a
`bookbuild'.  The evidence indicates that
 Warburg Dillon Read Australia
Limited has been appointed as the lead manager and bookrunner with respect to
the offer of Mirvac
Group stapled securities under the selling arrangements,
while ABN Amro Rothschild has been appointed co-manager of that offer.
<P>

16	Additionally the explanatory memorandum and associated documents contain
detailed information with respect to the calculation
of price for the purpose
of the selling arrangements and the paying out of security holders who opt for,
or are required to take,
cash.
<P>

17	Finally, I should note that the explanatory memorandum contains
prospectus-like disclosure with respect to the  business of the
merging
entities and the merged group, including, as is now common in such
transactions, pro forma accounts of the consolidated group,
earning and
distribution forecasts for the unmerged entities and an earning and
distribution forecast for the merged economic entity.
 There is evidence that a
due diligence investigation has been conducted for the purpose of verifying the
information contained in
the explanatory memorandum.  
<P>

18	The explanatory memorandum is supported by an investigating accountant's
report on the historical and forecast financial statements
preferred jointly by
PricewaterhouseCoopers and PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities Limited (which
holds a dealers licence under the
Corporations Law).  It is also supported by
an independent expert's report by Grant Samuel &amp; Associates which relates
to the
VPO scheme and the proposal as it affects unitholders, as well as the
share scheme. Grant Samuel concludes that the merger is in
the best interests
of Mirvac shareholders and optionholders, and also in the best interests of the
unit holders of CPT and MPT. There
is also a taxation report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities Limited which deals amongst other things with
the taxation position
of holders of stapled securities.
<P>

19	Enough has been said by me to indicate that the share scheme and the wider
proposal to which it relates are quite complex in
matters of detail. Counsel
for Mirvac has acknowledged that in this matter the paperwork is voluminous but
he submits that the devil
is in the detail rather that the concept. I agree
with him.
<P>

20	In my opinion the application for orders convening a shareholders meeting to
approve the share scheme in this case falls within
the established law and
practice of this Court relating to schemes for corporate reconstruction. The
complexity arises because not
only is there a parallel option scheme (not
uncommon with listed entities) but also there are parallel reconstruction
proposals for
the two trusts and an ultimate stapling of securities.  
<P>

21	As far as the share scheme is concerned, there are just a few matters upon
which I should specifically comment. First, as I have
indicated, the
explanatory statement which the Corporations Law and Regulations require for
such a scheme is both the explanatory
memorandum (which also covers the VPO
scheme, the trust restructuring and other matters outlined above) and the
Mirvac overview.
 In my opinion, it would be undesirable to produce separate
explanatory statements for each scheme and the trust restructuring. This
is
because, although the share scheme itself will apply only to that part of the
overall proposal which binds the company and its
shareholders, it is properly
to be seen as a component in the larger transaction.  The complexity of detail
makes it appropriate
to place the information which is common to each proposal
in a single document, while also supplying a simple overview document to
the
shareholders who are to consider the share scheme.  Nothing in the Corporations
Law and Regulations prohibits the distribution
of an explanatory statement
comprising two documents.  The overview makes it clear that full disclosure is
not intended to be achieved
through that document alone.  The overview is
endorsed with advice to the recipient to read both documents carefully before
deciding
how to vote on the resolutions which are proposed. Given the
complexity of the transaction, in my opinion the approach taken by the
production of separate overview documents is a sensible one.  Production of a
simple explanatory document is encouraged by the policy
reflected in proposals
to amend the Corporations Law in the Corporations Law Economic Reform Bill 1998
and with modifications granted
by the Commission in respect of other major
transactions such as the partial privatisation of Telstra Corporation and the
demutualisation
of the AMP Society;  although in each of those examples the
further document was not distributed except on request.
<P>

22	Secondly, the share scheme meeting is to be followed by a meeting of the
company in which various resolutions will be proposed
to give effect to the
overall proposal including a resolution to adopt a new corporate constitution.
Meetings of unitholders of the
two trusts are also proposed at which amendments
to their constitutions are intended to be adopted. In none of the three cases
is
it proposed that the documents sent to security holders will include the
full text of the relevant constitution as affected by the
resolution. Instead,
in each case the explanatory memorandum purports to give a summary of the
substantial effect of the adoption
of the resolution, and states that the full
text of the constitution as amended can be inspected at a specified place or
obtained
upon request.
<P>

23	In my opinion it is not necessary in the present case to add to the burden
of paper by distributing the full text of the relevant
new constitution. Having
inspected the three constitutions, I doubt that they would convey much useful
information to the lay reader,
given their predictable length and complexity.
Instead it is much more useful, consistently with principles frequently
enunciated
by the Courts with respect to disclosure in a notice of meeting (see
for example, <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452)</a> to give a
concise and clear summary of the effect of the changes which is materially
comprehensive.  I do not say that such an approach
is always justifiable, but
rather that it is clearly justifiable here in view of the overall complexity of
the proposals and the
particular complexity of the constitutional changes which
are necessary to implement them. It is implied from what I have said, however,
that those responsible for convening a meeting at which constitutional changes
are proposed must be scrupulously careful, if they
are to use the disclosure
technique used in this case, that the summary of the effects of changes is
accurate and complete in all
material respects.
<P>

24	Thirdly, one specific matter to which counsel drew my attention relates to
the period for receipt of notice of meetings.  In
this case the timetable has
been completed in such a manner as to allow three days.  This has been adopted
as a practical approach,
though counsel notes that the legal position has been
rendered uncertain by amendments to the Corporations Law introduced by the
Company Law Review Act which took effect on 1 July 1998. 
<P>

25	Prior to that date the  situation was relatively clear.  Section 247(4) of
the Corporations Law had the effect that the constitution
of a company could
specify the point of time at which notice of a meeting is deemed to have been
received by shareholders, but in
the absence of such provision, the `default
rule' was that stated in the Table A articles. Section 247(4) was repealed by
the Company
Law Review Act. 
<P>

26	Now section 249H(1) states, without relevant qualifications, that at least
twenty-one days notice must be given of a meeting
of a company's members,
though the constitution may specify a longer minimum period.  In the case of a
listed company section 249HA(1)
demands that at least twenty-eight days notice
be given. Neither of these provisions gives any guidance as to the point of
time at
which the period of notice commences to run. 
<P>

27	In <i>Re RGC Limited</i>, cited above, Young J referred very briefly to the
problem. He appears to have taken the view that the corporate constitution
cannot
determine the commencement point for notice because neither section
249H(1) nor section 249HA(1) makes any specific allowance for
the constitution
to do so. Young J expressed the opinion that in the circumstances, the period
of notice must be computed under section
249J(4). That provision states that a
notice of meeting sent by post is taken to be given three days after it is
posted, while if
sent by fax or other electronic means, notice is taken to be
given on the business day after it is sent.
<P>

28	Young J's conclusion has been criticised:  See R L Barrett  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJ
178.</a>   The basis of the criticism is that section 249J(4) is stated to be a
replaceable rule, which under section 135 applies only to
a company registered
on or after 1 July 1998 or a company which after that date repeals its
constitution.  Obviously at the present
time there will be very few companies
to which the replaceable rules adopted by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/clra1998210/" class="autolink_findacts">Company Law Review Act 1998</a> will
have any application.  Mr Barrett speculates that in those circumstances the
correct method of computing the commencement point
should be derived from
section 109Y, which has the effect that notice is taken to have been given at
the time when the document is
delivered in the ordinary course of post.
However, as he notes, the language of section 109Y is not obviously appropriate
to deal
with notice of a meeting, because it purports to apply only `where a
provision of this Law authorises or requires any document to
be served by
post', and subparagraph 109Y(a) uses language which appears to be particularly
inappropriate.
<P>

29	It appears to me that section 249J(4) provides a partial solution to the
problem, though only indirectly.  One can extract from
section 249J(4), when
read in context with section 135(2), a legislative intention to allow a
constitutional provision governing
computation of the commencement point to be
operative.  That view appears to draw support from the explanatory memorandum
to the
Company Law Review Bill, which states: 
<P>

	`A replaceable rule provides that notices sent by post will be taken to be
given 3 days after they are sent and that notices sent
by fax or electronically
will be taken to be given on the business day after they are sent (Bill s
249J(4)).  These time periods
are consistent with those generally adopted in
current practice.  However, a company will be able to replace them if they wish
to
adopted different time periods.' 
<P>

30	This implies that there was no legislative intention to change the previous
law under which the computation provisions of the
corporate constitution were
effective.  It would follow that section 109Y would have application, if at
all, only in the event that
the corporate constitution is silent on the
question of computing the commencement point.
<P>

31	In the present case, there is no practical problem because of the cautious
approach taken by those who have framed the proposal,
which allows for the
period of three days contained in Young J's judgment rather than relying on the
provisions of article 20 of
Mirvac's constitution, which would permit a shorter
period.
<P>

	<b>VPO scheme</b>
<P>

32	It is proposed that at the time of the merger $100 million in additional
capital will be raised by the Mirvac Group. The new
capital is intended to be
raised by way of restructure of the existing VPOs which were issued by Mirvac
in 1997 and are quoted on
the ASX.
<P>

33	When they were issued in 1997 the terms of the VPOs enabled Mirvac to raise
$100 million by two tranches of $50 million each
up to June 2001.  As part of
the restructuring, it is proposed that the terms of issue of VPOs be amended so
that they will be delisted
and the full value of $100 million will be callable
shortly after the merger. As one would expect, this proposal assumes a minimum
value for the Mirvac Group stapled securities.  On the exercise of the VPOs,
stapled securities rather than shares will be issued.
 If the merger proceeds
but the restructure of VPOs is not approved, then Mirvac will purchase them in
accordance with the original
terms of issue and additional capital will be
raised by way of placements of stapled securities.
<P>

	<b>Judicial advice</b>
<P>

34	In proceedings 2038 of 1999 MFL and CPML seek judicial advice under section
63 of the Trustees Act (NSW) 1925. That section provides
certain limited
protection to a trustee who acts in accordance with the advice given by the
Court.
<P>

35	The application for advice is supported by a statement on behalf of those
two entities. The statement sets out the restructure
proposal for each of the
two trusts.  It is unnecessary for me to give any further or fuller
descriptions of the proposals at this
stage in view of the matters which I have
set out earlier in this judgment.  Importantly, as far as unitholders are
concerned, the
proposed merger will be achieved not by any Court-approved
scheme of reconstruction but rather by the adoption of constitutional
amendments.  
<P>

36	In that context the two responsible entities have sought the opinion, advice
and directions of the Court in relation to the following
matters:
<P>

	(a) whether each of MFL and CPML is justified in convening meetings of their
respective unitholders to consider the resolution
set out in the explanatory
memorandum;
<P>

	(b) whether either of them is justified in amending their respective
constitutions in the manner proposed;  and
<P>

	(c) whether, if the amended constitutions are accepted for lodgment in the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission, each
of them is justified in
effecting and implementing the proposal in the explanatory memorandum.
<P>

37	The proposed amendments to the constitutions of the two trusts are contained
in draft supplementary deed polls, each of which
is expressed to be governed by
the law of New South Wales. The MPT constitution states that it is governed by
the law of New South
Wales.  As I have indicated, Mirvac was incorporated in
this State. CPT's constitution states, however, that it is governed by the
law
of the Australian Capital Territory.
<P>

38	In my opinion this Court has jurisdiction to provide judicial advice to the
responsible entities of the two trusts as trustees
notwithstanding that the
trust instrument for one of the trusts is expressed to be governed by a law
other than the law of New South
Wales.  The question of jurisdiction was
referred to by McLelland CJ in Eq in <i>Permanent Trustee Co Limited v National
Australia Managers Ltd </i> (unreported, 8 August 1994).  His Honour concluded
in that case that it was appropriate for him to exercise jurisdiction under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a> of New South Wales to give judicial advice notwithstanding that the
proper law of one of the trusts was the law of Victoria.
<P>

39	In my opinion it is unlikely that the proper law governing the merger as it
affects the CPT is the law of the Australian Capital
Territory rather than the
law of New South Wales. However, even if it is the law of the Australian
Capital Territory, I am persuaded
that it is appropriate in the circumstances
of this case to provide judicial advice to the trustees of both trusts
concurrently,
of the kind which I propose to provide under the New South Wales
Act. If it were necessary to do so, I would rely on the Jurisdiction
of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Acts of the Commonwealth and New South Wales as a source of
jurisdiction.
<P>

40	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 63</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a> of New South Wales judicial advice may
be given to a `trustee'.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> says that `trustee' has a meaning
corresponding with that of trust.  `Trust' is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a>, inter alia,
to include implied and constructive trusts and cases where the trustee has a
beneficial interest in the trust property.
<P>

41	In the present case steps have been taken pursuant to Chapter 5C of the
Corporations Law and the relevant transitional provisions
for MFL and CPML,
which were formerly managers of the respective trusts, to become the
responsible entities.  That having occurred,
section 601FC(2) states that the
responsible entity holds scheme property (in this case the property of the
respective trusts) on
trust for scheme members (in this case the respective
unitholders).  There are therefore express trusts here and each responsible
entity clearly falls within the definition of the `trustee' for the purposes of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 63.</a> I see nothing in Chapter 5C of the Corporations Law to suggest that
it is intended to exclude the Court's jurisdiction to provide
judicial advice
to a responsible entity under general trustee legislation.  I therefore
conclude that I have  jurisdiction to provide
appropriate advice in this
case.
<P>

42	As I have indicated, the central proposal in respect of each of the two
trusts is that very substantial changes will be made
to their constitutions
having the effect of implementing the stapling arrangements;  and also there
will be a redemption of units
in order to pay out unitholders who do not wish
to take stapled securities or are excluded from doing so under the terms of the
arrangement.
 The amendments also permit the consolidation of units and deal
with the mechanics of stapling. 
<P>

43	Under the constitutions of the respective trusts, which are not materially
different, there are powers of amendment.  They are
to be found in clause 29 in
the case of MPT and clause 62, when read in conjunction with clause 59, in the
case of CPT. In each of
those cases, the constitution authorises the trustee
and manager, effectively now the responsible entity, to alter or amend the
constitution
by supplemental deed. Several grounds for doing so are set out,
one of which is in each case simply that the amendment is approved
by special
resolution of unitholders. The amendments proposed in the present case are to
be adopted by special resolution of unitholders.
 Now that each of the trusts
is a managed investment scheme under Chapter 5C of the Corporations Law,
amendments to the constitutions
are governed by section 601GC. Subsection
601GC(1) states that the constitution of a registered scheme may be modified
by, inter
alia, special resolution of the members of the scheme.
<P>

44	Section 601GC is not entirely consistent with the alteration provisions
contained in the constitutions.  This is because the
section implies that the
passing of the special resolution is the operative event, whereas the
constitutional provisions proceed
upon the basis that the amendment is effected
by the responsible entity executing a supplemental deed after the special
resolution
has been passed. It is unnecessary to resolve any tension arising
from a comparison of the constitutions with the section because
what is
proposed here is that the special resolutions approving the amendments will be
closely followed by the execution of the supplemental
deeds.
<P>

45	In the <i>Permanent Trustee</i> case to which I have referred, McLelland CJ
in Eq was asked to consider whether a provision in a trust deed similar to the
alteration
in this case was effective to permit the adoption of a scheme of
reconstitution not entirely dissimilar from the present proposal.
He expressed
the view that the alteration power was very wide and was in quite unlimited
terms. He rejected an argument to the effect
that the alteration power was to
be confined to amendments which could reasonably have been foreseen at the time
when the deed was
made, or that there was some limit by reference to
destruction of substratum. In his opinion the only relevant limitation was that
the power of amendment was to be used only for the purpose for which it was
conferred. He took the view that the evident purpose
of the wide power before
him was to ensure maximum flexibility.  Unitholders would have the protection
of the requirement of a special
resolution and the requirement that the manager
must act in good faith in what it perceives to be the interests the
unitholders.
 He concluded that an amendment which had the effect of bringing
the trust to an end by the cancellation of units was authorised
by the amending
power.
<P>

46	I am content to adopt and apply McLelland CJ in Eq's reasoning with respect
to the similarly worded powers of amendment before
me in this case, and to
apply the same reasoning to the statutory power of amendment contained in
section 601GC. I therefore conclude
that notwithstanding the significance of
the amendments in the present case and notwithstanding that they will produce
the consequence
of compulsorily requiring that certain unitholders be cashed
out, they are authorised by the statute supplemented by the provisions
of the
two constitutions.
<P>

47	In the circumstances presented to me, I therefore have no hesitation in
providing judicial advice, similar to the advice provided
by McLelland CJ in
Eq, to the effect that the two responsible entities would be justified in
proceeding on the basis that the making
of the amendments which are proposed,
following approval by special resolution of unitholders, would be within the
powers of alteration
which they possess.  In those same circumstances I also
have no hesitation in providing judicial advice to the effect that the
responsible
entities are justified in convening meetings to consider the
proposals which are to be put to the unitholders.
<P>

48	The application also seeks judicial advice which would go further by stating
that the responsible entities would be justified
in giving effect to and
implementing the proposals set out in the explanatory memorandum. In my opinion
it would be unwise to give
advice of that kind at the present stage.  In this
case, the matter comes before me ex parte in conjunction with the scheme
proposals
which I have described.  Those proposals will be put to meetings of
shareholders, optionholders and unitholders respectively for
consideration.
There is bound to be a further hearing with respect to the two schemes of
arrangement, and in the present proceedings
I am asked to make orders having
the effect that any unitholder who wishes to make any application may do so
when the matters return
to the Court. In those circumstances judicial advice
broadly to the effect that all implementation steps may be taken seems to be
premature and too widely expressed.
<P>

49	In reaching that conclusion I have been influenced by another judgment of
McLelland CJ in Eq. in <i>Re J W Murphy &amp; P C Allen; re BPTC (in liq)</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%20569" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19 ACSR 569.</a> In that case his Honour envisaged that certain kinds of
advice, such as advice with respect to the performance of a contract, might
be
sought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/index.html#p68" class="autolink_findacts">Part 68</a> Rule 2(4) of the Supreme Court Rules rather than under
section 63. While the circumstances before me are different from the
circumstances
in that case, it seems to me that a broad judicial commendation
of the course of conduct to be embarked upon in circumstances which
cannot
presently be known but which may come to be known to the Court at a later
stage, would be an unwise exercise of the Court's
power under section 63.
<P>

	<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

50	I have therefore made orders for the convening of the meetings for the two
schemes and orders providing judicial advice to the
extent indicated in these
reasons.
