<P>

1	<b>ADAMS J:  </b>The plaintiff seeks a declaration that a search warrant
issued by a Justice pursuant to s 27 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
Act</i> 1979</a> (the Act)  and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">part 3</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/" class="autolink_findacts">Search Warrants Act</i> 1985</a>
granted on 22 September 1998 and executed the following day should be declared
invalid and of no effect together with consequential
relief.  On 29 March 1999,
when this matter came on for hearing before me, I delivered a judgment on the
primary question to the
effect that the warrant is invalid on its face.  In
purported exercise of the warrant certain animals, documents, and things were
seized.  Subject to certain conditions, I ordered the return of the documents
and things leaving for later decision a determination
of the appropriate relief
concerning the animals.  
<P>

2	In determining the appropriate relief, it has been submitted to me by Mr
Lancaster, counsel for the first and third defendants,
that ss 26 and 26A of
the Act permitted the officers to enter the plaintiff's premises and take the
animals which were removed together
with those documents and things that will
afford evidence of the commission of an offence under the Act or regulations
whether committed
or for which there are reasonable grounds for believing it
has been committed.  Section 26(1) of the Act is in the following terms
-
<P>

	Where an officer who is the holder of a prescribed authority suspects, on
reasonable grounds, that an offence against Part 2 is
being, has been or is
about to be committed in respect of an animal, the officer may:
<P>

	(a)	take possession of the animal,
<P>

	(b)	remove the animal to such place as he thinks fit, and
<P>

	(c)	retain possession of the animal:
<P>

	(i)	except as provided in subparagraph (ii)-for a period not exceeding 30 days
from the date upon which the officer takes possession
of the animal under
paragraph (a), or
<P>

	(ii)	where, within the period referred to in subparagraph (i), proceedings are
commenced in respect of the offence, and unless
the court before which the
proceedings are being taken otherwise directs - until the proceedings are
finally determined,
<P>

	but nothing in this subsection limits the operation of subsections (2)-(5).
<P>

Sub-sections (2) and (3) permit possession and removal of an animal where, in
the opinion of the relevant officer, it had not been
provided with proper and
sufficient food or drink during the previous 24 hours and is not being provided
with that sustenance and
where the animal is so severely injured, diseased or
in such a physical condition as to require veterinary treatment which is not
being provided.  Section 26(4) permits removal of an animal which is in such a
state that it is cruel to keep it alive in order that
it be humanely killed and
s 26(5) permits a relevant officer who suspects on reasonable grounds that the
conditions in subsections
(1) (2) (3) and (4) have been satisfied to inspect
and examine the animal in question.  Section 26(7) provides as follows -
<P>

	An officer who is the holder of a prescribed authority may, for the purpose of
exercising a power conferred upon him by subsection
(1)-(5), enter or remain in
or on premises and, where he does so enter or remain, shall produce the
authority, if requested to do
so by an occupier of the premises, for inspection
by that occupier.
<P>

In this case the RSPCA officers entered the premises forcibly, the plaintiff
then (as it happened) being absent in Newcastle.  If
the warrant had been
valid, then such entry would have been lawfully authorised by it.  Counsel for
the plaintiff, Mr Papayanni,
submitted that because the defendants purported to
enter pursuant to the warrant, the mere fact that there may have been an
independent
power of forcible entry is irrelevant as they were not purporting
to exercise that power.  He also submitted that, at all events,
the power of
entry conferred by s 26(7) did not permit entry into private property or a
dwelling house on private property without
the permission of the owner or
occupier.
<P>

3	In <i>Egg Marketing Board v Cassar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 90</a>, the question arose
whether the Board was authorised to forcibly enter and search certain premises
pursuant to regulations made under
the <i>Marketing of Primary Products Act
</i>1927 which provided as follows -
<P>

	34(1)   For the purposes and subject to the provisions of the Act any officer,
employee or servant of the Board duly authorised
by the Board in that behalf
may at all reasonable times upon production of such authority enter and search
any land, premises . .
. in or upon which eggs are being, or are suspected of
being, produced . . . and may inspect any eggs. . . and may take samples of
eggs . . . and may inspect any books . . . or writings therein . . .
<P>

Waddell J, following <i>Grove v Eastern Gas Board</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%201%20KB%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] 1 KB 77</a> and
<i>Fowler v Taylor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1957/85.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] VicRp 85</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%20VR%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] VR 593</a>, held that if a right of entry is given by
statute, prima facie, that includes a right to make a forcible entry and the
officer authorised
to enter is entitled to use whatever force is reasonably
necessary in order to effect an entry.  The requirement to produce the
authority
did not mean that a person must be present on the premises to whom it
could be produced, rather that the document should be produced,
if required.

<P>

4	I am of the view that <i>Egg Marketing Board v Cassar</i> is correctly
decided and that I should apply the rule of construction adopted by Waddell J
to the interpretation of s 26(7) of the
Act.  The observation by Deane J in
<i>Fowler v Taylor</i> [1957] VR at 596 that if the officer could enter only
with the consent of the occupier, no statutory authorisation would be required
and the power of entry given by the Act would be otiose, is, with respect,
obviously correct.
<P>

5	It was submitted that the provision in s 27 of a power to obtain and issue
search warrants indicates that s 26(7) should be read
down since otherwise the
former provision would be unnecessary.  However, s 27 seems to me to cover
quite different ground to that
covered in s 26.  First, the application for a
search warrant may be made by any person and is not confined to a relevant
officer
and this difference remains significant despite s 27(3) authorising the
issue of a search warrant only to a relevant officer, since
the prerequisite
for the application is that the person has reasonable grounds for believing
that there is, in or on any premises,
an animal in respect of which an offence
against the Act or regulation is, inter alia, suspected of being committed
whilst the officer
authorised by the search warrant to enter and search
premises and inspect and examine animals or registers is not required to have
any reasonable grounds for any belief.  Second, the warrant authorises entry
and search, inspection and examination in connexion
with the suspected offence,
whilst the powers pursuant to which the authority to enter conferred by s 26(7)
are limited to animals
where, in the opinion of the relevant officer, specified
adverse conditions are demonstrated and particular courses of action permitted.

<P>

6	I am therefore of the view that the powers given by s 26(7) of the Act are
not abrogated merely because the first defendant purported
to act pursuant to a
warrant obtained under s 27 which was, as it happened, invalid.  The plaintiff
submits, however, that even if
s 26 would have authorized entry and seizure of
the animals, as the powers given by its provisions were not actually relied on
by
the first defendant but rather reliance was placed on the invalid warrant,
these acts remain unlawful.  
<P>

7	As a matter of construction, there is nothing to show that the powers
provided by s 26 are abrogated or qualified in the manner
suggested.  In
particular, the officer is not required to state to any occupier that the entry
is made pursuant to s 26 for the purposes
of sub-sections (1) to (5) or any of
them although his or her prescribed authority must be produced if requested (s
26(7)).  In my
view that the section makes specific reference to what is to be
produced on request, falling short of a statement of grounds for
the entry,
strengthens the conclusion that such a statement is not a prerequisite to
permissible forcible entry.  As it happens,
no request was made for inspection
of the first defendant's authority or for the reasons for entry.  Of course, no
person was present
at the time of entry, the plaintiff returning to the
premises after the first defendant had been there for many hours.  A failure
to
state any grounds for entry onto the property or for remaining there at that
time could not render these acts unlawful at all
events.  Nor to my mind did
remaining on the property and removing the animals become unlawful merely
because (on the plaintiff's
account) she demanded that the animals not be
taken.  At all events, as the plaintiff admits, she was handed the Occupiers'
Notice
shortly after her arrival that referred, although under cover of the
warrant, to the exercise by the first defendant of "all such
powers under
section 25 and 26 of" the Act.  Although a failure to sufficiently state the
reasons for entry and remaining on the
property and removal of animals may
provide a defence to obstruction under s 28 of the Act, I am of the view that,
providing those
acts fall within s 26, they are not unlawful even though such a
statement is not made.  Mr Papayanni of counsel for the plaintiff
submitted
that the opposite conclusion was compelled by <i>Christie v Leachinsky</i>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1947/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%20AC%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) AC 573.</a>  In that case constables arrested the plaintiff in purported
exercise of a right of arrest for a particular offence which, however,
was not,
in the circumstances, one for which a person could be arrested and sought,
later, to justify the arrest by evidence that
they suspected him of another
offence for which he could be arrested but which they did not mention at the
time.  The House of Lords
decided that, at common law, any arrest on suspicion
of the commission of a crime was not lawful unless, at the time of the arrest,
the person was informed of its reason, unless the general nature of the alleged
offence for which he is detained must otherwise have
been made known to him
(see eg [1947] AC per Viscount Simon at 587).  I am of the view that, in the
circumstances, the plaintiff
must have known of the general nature of the
reasons for which the first defendant had entered and remained on her premises
and why
the animals were being removed, even on her own account.  At all
events, as s 26 does not require for the lawful exercise of the
powers it
grants that the occupier of the premises or the owner of the animals be
informed of the grounds for their exercise, <i>Christie v Leachinsky</i> is
distinguishable.
<P>

8	Accordingly, providing the prerequisites for entry under s 26(7) are
satisfied, forcible entry by the relevant officer was in
this case authorised
by the Act.  Before moving to consider whether those prerequisites were
satisfied, I should deal with s 26A
of the Act.  Section 26A(1) provides -
<P>

	An officer who is the holder of a prescribed authority and who is lawfully in
any place investigating a suspected breach of this
Act or the regulations may
seize:
<P>

	(a)	a thing with respect to which an offence has been committed, or
<P>

	(b)	a thing that will accord evidence of the commission of an offence, or
<P>

	(c)	a thing that was used, or is intended to be used, for the purpose of
committing an offence.
<P>

9	The powers conferred on a relevant officer by subs 26(1) to (5), which give
rise to the power to enter premises under s 26(7)
do not include a power to
investigate a suspected breach of the Act or regulations.  To my mind, such a
power can only be exercised
pursuant to a search warrant obtained under s 27.
Consequently, the prerequisite for seizure under s 26A is not satisfied here,
there
being no valid warrant.  Thus, the officer cannot rely on s 26A to
authorise the seizure or retention of the things and documents
purportedly
seized and retained pursuant to the warrant obtained by her.  I have already
made orders as to these items and it is
unnecessary to deal further with this
issue for present purposes.
<P>

10	In this case, the relevant officer is the first defendant, Ms Leanne
Hackett.  "Officer" is defined relevantly in s 4 as being
"an officer of an
approved charitable organisation who is a special constable within the meaning
of the <i>Police Offences Act</i> 1901".  Such an organisation means "a
charitable organisation for the time being approved by the Minister".  Ms
Hackett discloses
in her affidavits that she was at the material time an
inspector employed by the third defendant which was approved by the Minister
on
15 April 1998 (NSW Government Gazette No 71, 24 April 1998).  On 29 August 1995
Ms Hackett was appointed a special constable and,
at a date which is uncertain
but covered the material times, she was authorised by the Minister to exercise
the powers conferred
by s 25(1) and s 26 of the Act.
<P>

11	Accordingly, I am satisfied that at the material times Ms Hackett was "an
officer who is the holder of a prescribed authority"
within the meaning of s
26.  The next question is whether the prerequisite for the exercise of the
powers conferred by subs 26(1)
to (5) were satisfied in the circumstances.  
<P>

12	Taking first the requirements of s 26(1), the officer must suspect on
reasonable grounds that an offence against Part 2 of the
Act is being, has been
or is about to be committed in respect of an animal.
<P>

13	Ms Hackett deposed that on 22 May 1998, she spoke to one Alex Brittain, an
employee of Denistone Veterinary Clinic.  Mr Brittain
told her that the
plaintiff regularly brought cats and kittens into the surgery requiring
veterinary treatment, that he had seen
a number of her cats recently which had
to be euthanased because it was cruel to keep them alive and that pathology
results on cats
brought by the plaintiff to the surgery demonstrated a number
of infectious diseases namely FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis),
FIV (Feline
Immune-deficiency Virus), FELV (a form of leukemia) and FTLV (a feline
respiratory disease).  
<P>

14	Mr Brittain told Ms Hackett that the plaintiff's address was 84 Gurney Road,
Villawood and that he understood the plaintiff to
have over fifty cats.  Ms
Hackett attended the premises on 10 June, 15 June and 16 June 1998 but no one
was present on these occasions.
 On the last of these days, the plaintiff
telephoned her and asked why she was making enquiries.  The plaintiff asserted
that nothing
was wrong with her cats and that she was too busy to allow Ms
Hackett to come to her premises to inspect them, saying that she would
not be
available for two weeks.  On the assumption, and I think that it is reasonable
to infer, that most, if not all, of the  cats
at the plaintiff's premises on 23
September 1998 were also there on 1 July 1998, the statement that there was
nothing wrong with
them was untrue.  On that date, Ms Hackett attended the
plaintiff's premises with RSPCA Inspector James Paton.  She saw a cattery
which
was a large shed about the size of a double garage, in which there were about
seventy cats.  Many cats and kittens were coughing
and sneezing with runny
noses and weepy eyes.  Although they were generally not skinny, many displayed
flu-like symptoms and some
appeared to be missing an eye.  Many cats were
running free between the cattery and the house in which were more cats, one of
which
was a tortoiseshell three or four months old kitten, which was very thin
and had very watery eyes and scabs on its head.  
<P>

15	The plaintiff told Ms Hackett that most of the cats had been rescued from
fires two years previously, that the cats were all
desexed, that she was not
aware of the codes of practise that existed for operating a cattery, that she
had no records showing which
cats were ill and which were being treated and at
all events, there were no names enabling identification.  The plaintiff
implicitly
accepted that some of her cats had FIP and other diseases but
commented that simply because "you've been diagnosed with a terminal
illness
doesn't mean you should be put to sleep".  
<P>

16	On or about 4 or 5 September 1998, Ms Hackett spoke to one Cathy O'Neill,
the veterinarian consulted by the plaintiff.  Ms O'Neill
told Ms Hackett that,
following the visit to which I have referred, in July the plaintiff had told
her that she had removed a lot
of cats out of the premises and cleaned them up.
Ms O'Neill stated that she had been dealing with the plaintiff for some time
and
there had not been any problem with her animals until the last eighteen
months, ever since she took possession of a colony of cats
seized by Animal
Welfare and given to her.  She said that the plaintiff took cats in from a
variety of places, including intercepting
cats at the RSPCA carpark before they
were surrendered into the shelter.  Ms O'Neill said that the plaintiff brought
cats to her
when they became sick and diseased and that this happened every
week, sometimes only a couple and sometimes ten or more.  She said
that they
were brought in for a number of conditions and that an increasing number of the
plaintiff's cats and kittens had to be
euthanased because they had debilitating
illnesses.  Ms O'Neill said that she did not routinely vaccinate the
plaintiff's cats because,
as she thought, there were such a number that the
plaintiff could not afford it.  
<P>

17	Several days later, Ms Hackett attended at Ms O'Neill's veterinary clinic
and was provided with copies of various veterinary
notes and records which were
annexed to her affidavit.  Amongst other things, Ms O'Neill told her that the
plaintiff had recently
brought in a male ginger kitten with a growth or polyp
in its ear requiring further treatment and investigation but that it had not
been returned and that she had also seen a cat with a fractured jaw which she
suspected was caused by the application of physical
force by the plaintiff.  (I
interpolate here that neither Ms O'Neill nor the plaintiff gave evidence about
this and I do not regard
this statement as evidence of the truth of the matter;
on the other hand, it was material which Ms Hackett was entitled to consider
in
connexion with, at least, the reasonable suspicion referred to in s 26(1) of
the Act.)  
<P>

18	About a week later, an officer of the RSPCA, in response to an advertisement
in a newspaper, attended the plaintiff's premises
to purchase a cat, without
disclosing his identity.  The plaintiff provided the officer, together with the
cat purchased, a feline
vaccination record which, it was reasonable to suspect,
was a forgery.
<P>

19	Ms Hackett deposes that as a result of the matters which I have set out
above, she believed that in or on 84 Gurney Road, Villawood,
the plaintiff's
premises, there was an animal or there were animals "in respect of which an
offence against the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act</i> 1979</a> or
regulations had been or may have been committed or was about to be committed".
In particular, she "believed or suspected at the
time of making the Application
for . . . [the] search warrant" that -
<P>

	(i)	the occupant of 84 Gurney Road, Villawood was committing offences against
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5(3)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979</a>;  and
<P>

	(ii)	the occupant of 84 Gurney Road, Villawood was or may have been committing
offences against the Act, the Regulations and/or
the Code of Practice relating
to the care and management of breeding cats.
<P>

Section 5(3)(c) of the Act reads as follows -
<P>

	(3)	A person in charge of an animal shall not fail at any time:
<P>

	(c)	where it is necessary for the animal to be provided with veterinary
treatment, whether or not over a period of time, to provide
it with that
treatment.
<P>

Having regard to the material deposed to by Ms Hackett as having been in her
possession at the time of the issue of the warrant
and, also, at the time of
entry into the premises, there can be no doubt that the prerequisites for
exercising the power under s
26(1) were satisfied.  The mere fact that it was
not possible before entry to identify a particular animal as requiring removal
is
immaterial to the exercise of the right of entry conferred by s 26(7).
Accordingly, Ms Hackett was entitled to enter for that purpose.
<P>

20	Ms Hackett said, in a report prepared for her superior on 30 March 1999,
verified by affidavit -
<P>

	On 23rd September 1998, 176 cats were seized from 84 Gurney Rd, Villawood.  At
the time of the RSPCA inspection of the premises
it is estimated in excess of
200 cats were present on the property.  The cats on the property were contained
within the dwelling,
running free in the rear yard and verandah area, with the
majority housed in an enclosed garage.  I observed cats on the premises
at the
time of the inspection to be displaying symptoms of extensive hair loss,
respiratory difficulties including watery eyes and
running noses.  I observed
cats with ulcerated eyes and eyes missing.  I observed cats in poor to
emaciated body condition.  There
was diarrhoea and vomit throughout the house
and enclosed garage area.  A large portion of the cats seized from the premises
were
feral.  I estimate a minimum of 20 cats were left behind at the premises
as they were not contained and were unable to be caught
due to their feral
nature.  
<P>

In her evidence before me Ms Hackett said that, as each cat was placed in a
container, it was inspected by her, photographed and
tagged.  She said that her
opinion was that none of the cats were in good health, each one having at least
three conditions (such
as fleas, ear mites and lice) but most had up to six.
She was unable to establish which cats were under veterinary treatment but
was
of the opinion that a large number of them required such treatment.  It was
also Ms Hackett's opinion that numerous animals had
not been provided with
sufficient food in the previous 24 hours, inferring this from their body
condition which ranged from poor
to emaciated.  It was also her opinion that
there was a large number of animals that were in such a condition that it would
be cruel
for them to be kept alive.  Some support is provided for these
opinions by the fact that of the 175 live cats seized from the premises,
88
were shortly after euthanased by RSPCA veterinarians.
<P>

21	Mr Lancaster for the defendants read the affidavit of Christine Cole, a
veterinary surgeon employed by the RSPCA.  Amongst other
things, Ms Cole says
that on first examination 50% of the cats demonstrated respiratory disease
(conjunctivitis, nasal discharges),
20% were underweight, 60% had a skin
disease due to lice, fleas and flea allergy dermatitis, bacterial pyodermasis,
miliary dermatitis,
allergy and ringworm, 38% had ear mites, 14% had dental
problems, 37% gingivitis, 8% ear infections and, although not all animals
had
obvious skin disease, all had lice and fleas present to some extent and each
required treatment.
<P>

22	As Ms Cole said -
<P>

	As recurrent respiratory viral disease exists within this population, and many
individuals are "carriers" They require a well ventilated,
clean and uncrowded
environment where stress is avoided.  Daily individual observation is required.
Clinically affected (ie symptomatic)
individuals need to be isolated during the
course of their disease.  NO new individuals should be introduced to this
population as
endemic diseases within this population, such as FIV (aids),
respiratory viruses, feline infectious peritonitis etc are likely to
be
transmitted.  All individuals should be tested at 6 monthly intervals for FIV
and affected individuals should be housed separately.
<P>

23	Even if reasonable grounds are necessary for the opinions specified in subs
26 (2)-(5), which may be doubted, I consider that,
taking the circumstances as
a whole, and the appearance of the cats on the occasion of their seizure, Ms
Hackett did have the opinions
which she asserted she had and that there were
reasonable grounds for them.
<P>

24	The plaintiff did not dispute that the cats suffered from the conditions
which I have described.  Her attitude is, perhaps, summed
up in the following
evidence -
<P>

	Q.	Would you tell his Honour why do you want these cats back?
<P>

	A.	Because they were my cats;  because I love them and I can look after them.
I know they have a deadly disease but they don't
go anywhere.  They stay in the
run.  I know how to treat them.  I just love them and I know they are dying and
I want to be there
as they die and be able to say goodbye to them, hold their
paw or do whatever is necessary as they live out the rest of their life.
 They
. . .
<P>

	Q.	Other than the material requirements as to food and so on, do you give them
any affection?
<P>

	A.	I sit in the run. I nurse them. I spend most of my day in the run.  When
they were there I stayed in the run hosing it out,
playing with them.  Just
being with them.
<P>

	Q.	Does that occupy the whole of your life?
<P>

	A.	That's my whole life.
<P>

Regrettably, however, it appears that despite her no doubt sincere intentions,
the plaintiff was unable adequately to care for this
large number of cats, a
conclusion which I think is inevitable having regard to the reports to which I
have referred.  However, even
if the plaintiff was genuinely of the opinion
that none of the pre-requisites for the exercise of the powers in subs
26(2)-(5) existed,
that is not material to whether Ms Hackett was of the
relevant opinion;  neither does it follow that there were no reasonable grounds
for Ms Hackett to hold those opinions.  I should mention here, because this was
a subject of some controversy before me, that I consider
that the "veterinary
treatment" referred to in s 26(3) does not include veterinary examination,
alone:  see the definition of "veterinary
treatment" in s 4 of the Act.
<P>

25	I therefore conclude that, in addition to lawfully entering upon the
plaintiff's premises, the first defendant lawfully remained
on them and
lawfully removed the animals, the subject of the plaintiff's claim.
<P>

26	The summons seeks an order that the animals seized under the warrant be
returned within such period as determined by the Court.
 Section 26(1) of the
Act provides that the relevant officer may -
<P>

	(c)	retain possession of the animal:
<P>

	(i)	except as provided in subparagraph (ii) - for a period not exceeding 30
days from the date upon which the officer takes possession
of the animal under
paragraph (a), or
<P>

	(ii)	where, within the period referred to in subparagraph (i), proceedings are
commenced in respect of the offence, and unless
the court before which the
proceedings are being taken otherwise directs - until the proceedings are
finally determined, . . .
<P>

It was agreed at first by concession of the plaintiff that relevant proceedings
commenced within 30 days from 23 September 1998
namely on 22 October 1998.
However, informations were tendered before me by the plaintiff following the
concession, which was in
effect withdrawn.  Except with regard to one cat and
one dog,  the informations allege offences respectively concerning 12, 14, 25
and 36 cats.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 57</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act </i>1902</a> requires that every
information shall be for one offence only and not for two or more offences.  I
do not think that it can be seriously
maintained that these informations comply
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57.</a>  This is not a mere matter of form, as may be demonstrated by
<i>Johnson v Miller</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%2059%20CLR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 59 CLR 467.</a>  Mr Papayanni for the plaintiff
submits that those informations being invalid, relevant proceedings in relation
to the cats to which
they refer have not been taken within the meaning of s
26(1).  There is at all events some difficulty in relating the cats referred
to
in the informations to the cats presently alive and in the possession of the
third defendant, although I would be minded to find
that they do cover those
animals.  If the time limit specified by s 26(1) has not been complied with the
question arises whether
I should in the exercise of my discretion order return
of the animals, or some of them. 
<P>

27	The time element imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 56</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i> has now expired
so that fresh proceedings cannot now be commenced.  It follows that, except as
to the informations which refer to
only one animal and the one animal to which
at an appropriate time each of the other informations will be amended to refer
to, the
Local Court will have no power under s 26(1) to make orders as to
disposition pending the outcome of the proceedings.
<P>

28	Section 31 of the Act permits a court which has convicted a person in charge
of an animal of an offence against the Act to make
orders regarding disposal.
The advantage of such a court is that it can make those orders having regard to
the evidence before it
in respect of each animal which has been the subject of
an offence.  Taking the circumstances as a whole I am of the view that to
the
extent that I have any residual discretion concerning disposal of the animals
to which the informations do, or in due course,
will refer, I would not be
minded to exercise it.  Of course, four of the animals are as yet
unidentified.
<P>

29	As to the other powers of removal and retention specified in s 26(2)-(4),
that retention is permitted to continue only for the
purpose specified.  It is
obvious, in respect of s 26(2) that the animals have been provided with all
necessary sustenance and I
think that the evidence as to animals falling within
s 26(4) is that that those which it was cruel to keep alive have now been
destroyed.
 
<P>

30	Many of the remaining animals no longer require continuing treatment.  Of
the cats presently held by the RSPCA, the 15 housed
at Somersby do not
presently need veterinary treatment nor have they over the last month but they
do require some specific individual
attention from animal attendants for
afflictions such as runny eyes, small injuries and over-grooming of hair;  the
14 cats held
at the Katoomba shelter do not appear to be sick and generally
appeared to be in good health when they were placed there in mid October
last
year and, accordingly, did not require any veterinary treatment, one died of
natural causes shortly after being taken in and,
when some of them began
sneezing, the remaining 13 cats were given a broad-spectrum antibiotic with no
other treatment apparently
being necessary;  19 cats were sent to the Orange
shelter, some exhibiting symptoms of runny eyes and noses, sneezing, ear
infections
and dull coats, one was euthanased on being diagnosed with renal
failure and the cats as at 30 March 1999 otherwise appear to be
healthy and
happy.  
<P>

31	It has been submitted that the remaining animals, at all events, are
required for the purpose of evidence in the criminal proceedings
preferred
against the plaintiff and reliance is placed on the principle in <i>Puglisi
&amp; Anor v Australian Fisheries Management Authority &amp;</i> <i>Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=148%20ALR%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">148
ALR 393</a> at 405, to which I have already referred in connexion with the
documents and things seized.  However, it seems to me that the requirements
of
the prosecutions are adequately met by appropriate recording of the conditions
of the relevant animals.  At all events, it seems
almost inevitable that the
intervening veterinary treatment and other care provided by the RSPCA since
seizure has so materially
affected the animals that little if anything would be
gained by producing them even if, as seems most unlikely, such a course were
sought to be undertaken.  Accordingly, I would not be disposed to make orders
for retention based upon this consideration.  The court
dealing with the
charges laid under the Act has the necessary power to make appropriate orders
regarding the disposal of animals.
 It was suggested in evidence that the RSPCA
might find other homes for the healthy animals, but I do not see in the Act any
unilateral
power to do so.  However, this is not a matter which I need to
determine since, in the circumstances of this case, future disposition
of the
animals should await any appropriate orders that may be made under s 26.  
<P>

32	On the whole of the evidence, including my substantial doubts whether the
plaintiff is able to care for a large number of cats,
especially if they were
or might be affected with the viral diseases to which I have adverted, I would
not think it appropriate (even
if I had the power to do so) that I should order
a return of them and pre-empt the court's powers conferred by ss 26 and 31 of
the
Act.  I should, however, make it clear that that Court will need to
consider the exercise of its discretion in accordance with the
evidence adduced
before it and should not be influenced by any opinion which I have expressed as
to the adequacy of care provided
or able to be provided by the plaintiff.
<P>

33	Also seized on the occasion of the execution of the Warrant was an alsatian
dog which had flea allergy dermatitis, fly bitten
ears, patches of alopecia all
over its body, otitis, ear mites, fleas and lice.  I have been informed by Mr
Lancaster that that animal
is well and being kept in the RSPCA shelter at
Yagoona.  Accordingly, the principal relief sought by the plaintiff in these
proceedings
is refused.  In relation to the other matters of relief rather than
having them dealt with by orders it has been agreed between the
parties that
undertakings will be sufficient.
<P>

34	As I have mentioned, I consider that the animals were lawfully removed from
the possession of the plaintiff and I am of the view
that she is unable
adequately to care for them.  I do not therefore consider it appropriate to
exercise my discretion in her favour
in these proceedings to order a return of
the animals which are not covered by the current prosecutions, and I consider
that any
application for injunctive or other relief would for the same reasons
be refused, even if sought in proceedings which depended upon
the rights of
ownership of the plaintiff. 
<P>

35	I do not have to determine for present purposes what other action may be
available to the plaintiff to vindicate that right,
and I do not intend to
imply that those rights of property have as a matter of law in the present
circumstances at all events survived.
 In the circumstances, except so far as
the declaration concerning invalidity of the warrant is concerned, I do not
think that further
relief as requested by the plaintiff should be granted.
However, in the circumstances, I think I should make the following orders:
<P>

	No animal seized from the plaintiff's premises at 84 Gurney Road, Chester Hill
on 23 September 1998 now in the custody of the third
defendant can be
euthanased without giving 24 hours notice orally or in writing to the plaintiff
or the solicitors for the plaintiff
and, if requested, providing an opportunity
to the plaintiff to inspect the animal with an independent veterinary surgeon,
although
this order does not apply to an animal in such a condition that it
would, in the opinion of those charged with the care of the animal,
be cruel to
keep the animal alive during the 24 hour notice period.
<P>

36	[After hearing argument.]  In the circumstances, I think the appropriate
order is that there should be no order as to costs.
<P>
