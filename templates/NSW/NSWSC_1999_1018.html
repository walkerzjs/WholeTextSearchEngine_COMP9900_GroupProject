<b>L00009/93-  DAVID JACK GLEN</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

JUDGMENT<b> - On application for redetermination of Life Sentence</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The applicant seeks a redetermination of a life
sentence imposed upon him by me on 22 December 1986 following his
conviction
for murder.  He has now served 14 years of that sentence, calculated from the
time of his arrest.  The present application
was filed on 12 October 1993,
within days of the eighth anniversary of his arrest, from which time his
custody began.
<P>

2  	Although he is not to be criticised for seeking to exercise his
legal rights, the filing of an application upon that date, in
a case involving
the hideous circumstances of the present offence, does provide some measure of
his lack of insight and remorse at
that time.
<P>

<b>APPLICATION FOR ADJOURNMENT</b>
<P>

3  	The date of that application, however, has an additional
relevance, since it is his primary application today that the proceedings
be
adjourned until about June 2000, in order to allow him to complete the full
SORT (Sexual Offenders Redirectional Training) programme.
<P>

4  	It is accepted by counsel for the applicant that the position
still is in a state of fluidity, so far as his rehabilitation
and
responsiveness to the psychological counselling and sexual offender
diversionary training is concerned, and will remain so until
he completes the
full SORT programme.
<P>

5  	In the alternative to the proceedings being, and in the event of
the application being dismissed, it is Mr Ramage's submission
that the time for
a further application be reduced to something less than the period of two years
which would otherwise be applicable.
<P>

6  	Having regard to the circumstances which will be outlined later
in these reasons, I am of the view that it is inappropriate
for the application
to be further adjourned.  It has now been with the Court for almost six years,
during which period it was called
over twice in 1988 and for a third occasion
in May of this year.  On those first two occasions, the matter was stood over
upon the
basis that the application was not ready to be listed.  On the third
occasion, a similar application was made, but refused by the
List Judge.
<P>

7  	It is the fact that as late as March of this year, the applicant
was resisting the encouragement, which had been offered to
him, to engage in
psychological counselling and to participate in a sexual offenders diversionary
programme.  It was only after the
last call over that it became  apparent that
his attitude was changing and that the possibility of his entry into the SORT
programme
was a reality.
<P>

8  	I am of the view that it is utterly inappropriate for an
application of this kind to remain in limbo for six years, and that
the time
has arisen for it to be determined today.  Accordingly, I refuse the
application for an adjournment.
<P>

<b>THE OFFENCE</b>
<P>

9  	The applicant was 19 years old at the time of the offence.  He
had recently been separated from his wife and their daughter.
 The victim,
Kylie Corbett, was his 10 year old cousin to whom he had been recently
introduced.
<P>

10  	On the day of her murder, 10 October 1985, Kylie left home with
her six year old sister to walk to school.  She had with her
a bag of old
clothes for a school charity collection.  Whilst on their way to school, the
children met the applicant.  He invited
Kylie, but not her sister, back to his
flat where he said he had some clothes which she could add to her
collection.
<P>

11  	In his bedroom, he seized the girl by the neck and threatened
her with a knife.  After pushing her onto the bed, he directed
her to remove
her clothes.  He inserted a finger into her vagina, he said, as far as it would
go.  He then tied her up with a rope
around her hands, neck and feet and left
her on the bed while he went to the Westfield Shopping Centre for something to
eat and then
onto Church Street, Parramatta, to play the pinball machines.
<P>

12  	On his return to the flat, he repeated the assault and then took
the girl to the shower to wash the blood from her vagina and
from a tear that
stretched across the perineum. He permitted her to return to the main bedroom
where he cut the bonds from her hands
and invited her to read her school books.
He re-tied her hands and legs, leaving her to read the books by turning the
pages with
her mouth.
<P>

13  	After 10 minutes or so, he picked up a 20 inch military-style
baton and sitting athwart the girl, thrust it under her chin,
choking her until
she lost consciousness.  He partially dressed her, tied a cotton belt around
her neck and hung her from a bar in
the wardrobe partially supported by a
chair.  He then left the premises.
<P>

14  	When police gained access to his unit later that day, they
discovered the body of the girl, by now deceased, in the wardrobe.
<P>

15  	The post-mortem examination revealed constriction rings and
contusions around her neck, forearms and legs consistent with the
girl having
been tied in the manner described.  It also revealed that her vaginal walls
were contused and lacerated; the vaginal
orifice was gaping; the anal verge was
torn with abrasions present; and the anus was dilated and gaping.  Kylie had
obviously been
penetrated with considerable force with some object larger than
the single finger which the applicant claimed he had used in this
offence.
<P>

16  	Dr Malouf was of the opinion that the direct cause of death was
asphyxia due to hanging and the contributing cause was shock
due to trauma.
<P>

17  	The applicant was arrested on return to the unit. Although in a
recorded interview he admitted to placing one  finger in the
girl's vagina "for
something to do", he denied any further invasion of her vagina or anus.  When
asked whether he had intended to
kill her with a baton, he replied:
<P>

"No, I did not intend to kill her with a baton, I was going to kill her with a
knife but I couldn't get the courage up to stab her,
so I then took to the
baton and choked her."
<P>

18  	The applicant was first remand in custody was on 18 October
1985.  When he appeared before me for trial, he pleaded not guilty
of murder
but guilty of manslaughter. That plea was not accepted by the Crown.  The
applicant did not give evidence at his trial,
but he made an unsworn statement
in which he said:
<P>

"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am not guilty of murder.  I am sorry about
what has happened.  As I said in my record of interview,
I wish this hadn't
happened at all.
<P>

When I asked Kylie around to my flat I didn't have any intentions to hurt her.
I just wanted to give my wife's maternity clothes
to her because my wife left
me 12 days before and I thought I wouldn't see her or my daughter again.  I
don't know why I sexually
harassed Kylie.  I didn't plan for that to happen.
<P>

 
<P>

After I did that, I didn't know what to do, that's why I tied her up.  I didn't
want to hurt Kylie in any way, even though I said
&#180;If you scream or cry,
I'll kill you'.
<P>

 
<P>

I had a knife, but I didn't use it to hurt her, but just to cut the rope when
she said it was too tight.  I didn't put any part
of my body or anything into
her anus.
<P>

 
<P>

When I put the baton on her neck I didn't want to kill her or hurt her badly.
In fact, I don't know why I did that at the time and
I don't now know.
<P>

 
<P>

When I put Kylie into the wardrobe, I tied the cotton belt around her neck to
stop her falling off the chair as she was unconscious
at that time.  I didn't
do that to hurt her, to kill her.  I didn't think it would cause her any more
harm.
<P>

 
<P>

All I can say is I'm truly sorry for what I have done.  I mean that, but I have
done what I have done and there is nothing I can
say, but to say that I am
sorry and I don't know how it happened.  Thank you."
<P>

 
<P>

19  	While waiting for trial, the applicant sent a somewhat callous
letter to Kylie's mother in the following terms:
<P>

"Dear Auntie Barbara,
<P>

Hi.  I'm just writing to say that I'm truly sorry about what has happened, that
all I can do is time inside, that is in gaol.  Well,
I know it might be hard
for you, but it is hard for me too because I've lost my freedom, you I know I
have to do time for what I
have done.  Well, as you know, I go for trial on the
15th of December this year and at the  trial I'm going to plead not guilty to
the murder charge and for the sexual assault and I'm going to say a dock
statement.  Well, not much more I can say but that I'm truly
sorry about what
has happened, and I mean that, Auntie Barb. Well, it's bye, and I will see you
at court.  Love from David."
<P>

 
<P>

20  	While it may be that this letter was an attempt to express some
remorse, its timing and its terms demonstrate, beyond question,
the extent to
which the applicant was totally lacking in his appreciation of the seriousness
of his criminality, and of any remorse
for what he had done.
<P>

21  	When sentencing the applicant, I described it in the my reasons
as a `hideous killing'.  I remain of that view.  In fact, I
regard this as the
worst case of murder over which I have presided in my time on the bench since
1984.  No matter was then advanced
in mitigation of the criminality of the
applicant, nor has any now been advanced.  It remains an episode of a
sustained, deliberate
and sadistic violation of an innocent young girl for
which no rational explanation exists.
<P>

22  	While it may be that the applicant took Kylie to his flat on
impulse, what he did to her over the succeeding six hours or so
was deliberate
and controlled.  The case falls objectively in the category of the most serious
case of murder for which the prisoner
showed little, if any, remorse or
appreciation, at the time that he appeared for sentence, or for many years
thereafter.
<P>

23  	In my concluding remarks on sentence, I made the following
observations:
<P>

"Next, I wish to have recorded that the sentence I regard as appropriate for
the prisoner is such as to require very careful consideration
by the
authorities in relation to his future custody and in particular as to whether
he should be, at any time in the future, returned
back to the community. My
assessment in this regard is based upon the most careful and dispassionate
analysis of the crime charged
and the prisoner's personal profile.
<P>

 
<P>

There are matters in this case which I regard as of very great concern.  They
include the total lack of contrition expressed by
the prisoner, his callous
attitude towards the parents of his victim and his obvious lack of insight into
and acceptance of his wrongdoing.
<P>

 
<P>

Additionally, there is his refusal to discuss with the psychologists and
psychiatrists the matter concerning his sexual attitudes
and his state of mind
in that regard, when carrying out the sexual violation of his victim.  The
material available leaves me with
the view that this prisoner at this time
presents a very grave danger to the community, in particular to young
children.
<P>

 
<P>

While, once again, I do not mean by these remarks to fetter the discretion of
any relevant Board entrusted with a decision as to
the future release of him
back to the community, I would be remiss in my duty not to have these
observations recorded, since I have
had a special opportunity  to assess the
prisoner at the time he comes up for sentence.
<P>

 
<P>

It may be that after a lengthy period of imprisonment and counselling, a
fundamental change in his personality and ability to modify
his behaviour,
together with an acceptance of his criminality, may emerge.  Hopefully, that
will be the case and it is proper that
he be given the advantage of further
psychiatric counselling and assistance while he serves his sentence."
<P>

 
<P>

<b>SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES</b>
<P>

24  	The applicant had a disturbed childhood, with a criminal history
beginning at the age of eight years, comprising some 18 or
so entries for
offences such as burglary, malicious injury, stealing, shoplifting, absconding
and attempt to steal motor vehicle.
 He had been committed to child welfare
departments and to institutions in Victoria and New South Wales.
<P>

25  	His mother, who had nine other children, separated from his
father when he was very young.  On his account, he suffered from
periodic acts
of violence at the hands of his father, including an attempt at drowning and
the burning of his hands with ignited
lighter fluid.
<P>

26  	His schooling finished at year 8 after an unsatisfactory history
of truancy and fighting.  He had been on unemployment benefits
from the age of
16 years, although he had worked for a time earlier as a stable hand and
labourer.  He was an occasional user of
alcohol, cannabis and LSD.
<P>

27  	Before appearing for sentence he had been examined by three
psychiatrists, Doctors Milton, Barclay and Robertson, and by two
psychologists,
Anita Duffy and Greta Goldberg.  None detected any form of mental illness or
abnormality of the mind that may have
diminished his criminal responsibility,
although he was assessed as being of low/average intelligence.  Dr Milton
thought him to
be a personality limited with respect to intellect and in coping
with life.  The most probable explanation for the offence, he thought,
was that
the applicant sought an outlet for the stress occasioned by the separation, and
then murdered Kylie when he became frightened
over what he had done. 
<P>

28  	Dr Robertson suspected him to have a sociopathic personality
disorder based upon his history of antisocial behaviour.
<P>

29  	Miss Goldberg attributed his criminality, partly to depression
related to his separation, and partly to long-standing sexual
deviance as well
as a need to cover up the sexual assault.  She noted that it was likely that
irrational thoughts and behaviour on
his part could occur again.
<P>

30  	Dr Barclay, similar to Dr Robertson, thought that the applicant
had displayed the characteristics of an antisocial personality
disorder.   He
said:
<P>

"There is no truly logical explanation for the offence, except to say that it
is just another sad chapter in the prisoner's long
criminal record caused by
the impulsive behaviour for which he can provide no adequate explanation."
<P>

31  	The applicant is now aged 33 years.  His current classification
is B and he is held as a prisoner at the Junee Correctional
Centre.  Initially,
he was held in the Protection Centre of Long Bay until he was moved, in 1987,
for a short time to Maitland and
then to Goulburn.
<P>

32  	He was returned to Long Bay in June 1989 following
unsubstantiated suspicions of an escape plot by some life sentence prisoners.
While there, he remained on strict protection with consequent loss of
opportunity for education and employment.
<P>

33  	From about October 1989, repeated attempts have been made for
him to seek assistance from a psychologist to address the issues
related to his
offence and, in more recent years, to join a sexual offenders programme.  Until
very recently, on the face of the
prison files, he has resisted all of that
encouragement.
<P>

34  	After returning to Goulburn in 1990, he made some progress in so
far as he enrolled in an adult education course and sought
employment in the
tailoring shop.  Since then, he has completed other courses and has been in
fairly regular work in the tailoring
shop at various of the prisons, as well as
in their libraries and kitchens.
<P>

35  	In 1993, he was transferred to the Cooma Correctional Centre
with a B classification.  His performance deteriorated some time
after this
move, in the sense that he discontinued his educational courses and was sacked
from his position in the prison library,
when he became involved with a
transsexual inmate.  He did, however, later take up work in the kitchen and he
began a cooking course.
<P>

36  	He declined to participate in the sexual offenders SOAP (Sexual
Offenders Assessment Programme) programme at Cooma, because
he claimed that his
offence was not sexual but rather to do with anger, his cousin being a
substitute for his wife.
<P>

37  	In 1994, he was transferred to Parramatta Correctional Centre
before moving back to Goulburn in January 1995 when the protection
facilities
at Parramatta were closed.
<P>

38  	In February 1995, the Review Council transferred his management
to the Serious Offenders Management Committee, which recommended
his transfer
to Junee in anticipation of the establishment of a sex offenders programme at
that centre. The programme did not, however,
materialise at that time.
<P>

39  	In a letter dated 5 June 1995, the applicant did indicate, for
the first time, it would seem, an interest in undertaking the
SOAP programme
and, for that purpose, requested a transfer to Cooma.  The reason for the
request was expressed in the following terms:
<P>

"I wish to undertake the assessment because I have my determination of sentence
coming up soon and believe this course will help
me in my rehabilitation."
<P>

40  	Following this letter, the Case Manager prepared a programme
pathway providing some goals for him to aim at, on the way to
rehabilitation.
These goals included consultation with a psychologist, completion of an anger
management course and admission to
SOAP.
<P>

41  	The conclusion of the Serious Offenders Review Council as at 22
September 1995, is encapsulated in the following  paragraph
of its report,
which was prepared in anticipation of this application coming on for
hearing:
<P>

"Glen's behaviour in custody has, for the most part, been satisfactory.  There
is concern, however, that he lacks the capacity to
tackle the issues which were
raised by the sentencing judge, especially his lack of insight into the nature
of his offence and lack
of remorse and its implications for those who must
decide if, and when, he should be returned to the community.
<P>

42  	 
<P>

The Review Council, while not making any comment on the minimum sentence, if
any, the Court might consider appropriate, is of the
view that Glen has not
been rehabilitated and nothing can be said at this stage as to when, if ever,
he will be fit for release.
 He has failed at all material times to take
advantage of psychological assistance within the department.
<P>

 
<P>

It is observed that the Case Management Officer at Junee was not optimistic
that Glen would cooperate in the carrying out of the
programme prepared for
him."
<P>

43  	Additionally, in anticipation of the application coming on for
hearing, the applicant was reviewed by Dr. Westmore in March
1996.   His
opinion, at that time, is encapsulated in the following passage of his
report:
<P>

"This man has evidence of an antisocial personality disorder dating from an
early age. There is no evidence that he suffers from
a  mental illness.  He
certainly, at a verbal level, is expressing appropriate regret and remorse
regarding his actions, although
acknowledges that he has some difficulty in
expressing emotions regarding his behaviour or about any of the difficulties he
encountered
in his early life.  He needs continued and extensive psychological
and psychiatric support and indeed this was recommended by the
judge, it has
been recommended by others and is recommended now by myself.
<P>

	Until this is done I fear that it is very difficult to predict even at
general level his future risk to the community.  The nature
of his offending
behaviour, the quality of his behaviour is of major concern.  I think that we
would need to know a great deal more
about this young man, his psychosexual
development and his general levels of psychological adjustment and adaptation
before one could
comfortably make any predictions regarding his future risk to
the community".
<P>

44  	The supplementary report of SORC, dated 21 April 1999, discloses
that in November 1995, the applicant declined to be included
in a Sex Offenders
Redirection Programme (SORT) when it was introduced to the Junee Correctional
Centre, and that he was not cooperating
with the efforts which had been made to
get him to see a psychologist for assistance.
<P>

45  	When the opportunity arose for him to take a place in an
introductory pre-SORT program me in March 1999, he declined to participate,
even though he had earlier expressed a desire to do so.  The opinion of the
Review Council, at this stage, is expressed in the following
paragraph of its
report:
<P>

"While Glen's custodial reports and behaviour are excellent, he still refuses
to participate in any Sex Offenders counselling program.
 The Council will
continue to urge Glen to participate in suitable counselling while in
custody.
<P>

In the event that the Supreme Court grants Glen's application for the
redetermination of his sentence, then the Serious Offenders
Review Council will
develop a plan for his management during the remainder of any minimum term
imposed.  If Glen is prepared to co-operate
with the plan developed for him he
will be progressively reduced in security classification.  When he attains a C3
classification
he will be eligible to participate in unsupervised Day Leave and
Work Release programs in preparation for his eventual return into
the
community."
<P>

46  	Some further material has been placed before me since that last
assessment by the Council in the form of a further psychiatric
report from Dr
Bruce Westmore, a psychological report from Associate Professor Susan Hayes and
a report of Dr Roger Blake, together
with attached documentation concerning the
participation of the applicant in a preparatory SORT programme this year.  That
programme
was one which lasted a period of 8 weeks, comprising 24 hours, and it
led to a certificate of completion dated July 2, 1999.
<P>

47  	To that document and a more recent assessment I will return.
However, I should note that Dr Bruce Westmore, who reviewed the
applicant in
August 1999, noted that the applicant had informed him that he had previously
believed that he had no need for treatment,
and that he had only gone onto the
pre SORT programme because of this application.  He noted, however, that the
applicant had said
that having started the course, he felt that he had
benefited and had more understanding about how to avoid situations such as that
which had got him into gaol.
<P>

48  	He thought that the applicant needed more intensive work in
relation to several matters.  They included development of greater
insight into
his criminality, preparation for a move from institutionalisation to the
community, the provision of psychosexual education
and support, further
occupational training, and development of a social network to assist him in
gaining employment and in re-establishing
social contact outside the
correctional system.
<P>

49  	Dr Westmore's opinion was expressed as follows:
<P>

 "There is evidence this man has made some progress since my assessment of him
in 1996.  He is certainly appearing more willing
to attend the Sex Offenders
Programme and seems keen to have further counselling in this regard.  Once
again, I think it is too early
to indicate what current risk he represents to
the general community as he really has not had any extended counselling.  He
certainly
requires psychiatric and psychological support and, as notified
earlier in this report, this should extend while in the community.
 I have
identified a number of other areas which I think are significant in terms of
his eventual ability or otherwise to cope while
in the community and unless he
is provided with support and assistance while in custody; and unless this
support and assistance is
extended when he returns to the community, then this
man would, again, be vulnerable to psychological stress and perhaps a further
behavioural breakdown.
<P>

 
<P>

I note that prior to the homicide he was under stress, having separated from
his wife and apparently not dealing with that situation.
 He talked about anger
and &#180;having to take it out on somebody and the victim was the recipient of
that anger'."
<P>

50  	Associate Professor Hayes undertook a psychological assessment
of the applicant, also in August 1999.  She obtained a similar
history to that
previously noted concerning the applicant's earlier lack of motive for
psychosexual counselling, the reason for his
late entry into the preparatory
stage of the SORT programme and his wish to complete the further tiers.  Her
testing confirmed that
he was of low/average intelligence and free of clinical
symptoms of mental illness.  As to his propensity for further violence, she
noted that, apart from the one horrific and violent murder for which he is
serving the life sentence, he had no recent or other history
of violence and
had shown a significant change in his attitude and circumstances, as well as in
his personality traits.
<P>

51  	Her report concluded:
<P>

 "It is vital that Mr. Glen be given the opportunity to participate in
therapeutic programmes and in my opinion his involvement
in the Special Care
Unit would be a good idea.  Mr. Glen realises that he is destined to spend many
more years in prison, and indeed
that he may not be released at all;  he
himself states that he wants to ensure that he uses this time so that in the
event that he
is eventually released, he will be able to cope and will not be a
further danger to society.  One of the major difficulties in preparing
him for
release is his protection classification, which is no doubt necessary, given
the nature of his crime.  It is difficult gradually
to lessen his security
classification, given the need for protection.  Therefore, within the
restrictions imposed by being on protection,
Mr. Glen needs to engage in
whatever programmes are available.  Any programmes in which Mr. Glen is engaged
should take cognisance
of the significant discrepancy between his verbal and
non-verbal reasoning skills.  This is a source of great frustration to Mr.
Glen
because he knows he functions well in some arenas, but he finds it extremely
difficult to reason verbally and to express himself
verbally.  This results in
awkward and inarticulate expression of his feelings, which can readily be
misinterpreted as lack of cooperation
or lack of insight. He needs practice in
developing his verbal skills, as well as his writing skills.
<P>

Given appropriate, consistent and prolonged engagement in therapy, both group
and individual, and involvement in programmes for
increasing living skills,
self esteem, and coping skills, as well as a suitable and gradual lessening of
security classification,
Mr. Glen will have adequate opportunity to demonstrate
that he really is capable of making progress.  In these circumstances, it
is my
opinion that he is capable of being re-integrated back into the community with
minimal risk."
<P>

52  	The matter has been further updated, by the report of Dr Roger
Blake, a psychologist who reviewed the applicant at the request
of the Review
Council, following his entry into the pre SORT programme.  Of significance, Dr
Blake notes:
<P>

"In the writer's opinion, much of Mr Glen's request for  psychological
assistance seems to involve a need for amelioration of his
own sense of
suffering and ostracism within the system because of his crime.  It is
speculative at this point in time as to whether
Mr Glen has any real insight
into the feelings of guilt, shame or empathy, and clearly closer scrutiny and
assessment is needed.".
<P>

53  	Dr Blake noted, at the time of this report, that the applicant
was in week 4 of the preparatory programme, that he had joined
the group under
great duress, and that he had projected anxiety about the group process.  He
noted:
<P>

"At this point, the writer is not convinced that a strong motivation to embrace
treatment in any rehabilitatory context exists.
 While it is conjecture, the
satisfying of SORC requests may be his major motivation for joining the
Introductory Sex Offender Redirection
Training Programme. Despite these
factors, the writer concedes that Mr Glen is meeting all attendances and
homework requirements
of this preparatory programme."
<P>

54  	The self report inventory conducted by Dr. Blake led him to the
view that within the range of items covered, the applicant
"presents as being
within the very high risk category" in regard to his potential to engage in
further sexual violence.  Such factors
related to:  Evidence of sexual
deviation, previous substance abuse problems, physical harm to victim, negative
attitude towards
intervention, and evidence of personality disorder.
<P>

55  	It was his opinion that:
<P>

 "No major decisions should be made concerning Mr Glen's status within the
system until such time as a more complete risk assessment
can be conducted.
The optimal time for such assessment would be at the completion of the 17 week
SORT programme..."
<P>

56  	That programme the applicant could join in early 2000, if so
motivated.
<P>

57  	In conclusion, Dr Blake noted that it was his belief that Mr
Glen was "certainly a high risk individual".  He added:
<P>

"Accordingly, he should be viewed and assessed over an extended period of time
in a range of treatment contexts before any firm
judgment on his future risk
status or rehabilitation potential could be offered."
<P>

58  	In relation to the Pre SORT programme, I notice that his
assessment in areas of participation and motivation were at the lower
level of
"satisfactory," and that of attendance in the medium assessment of "good".
<P>

59  	It is the fact that the applicant has generally proved
cooperative within the general prison system, subject to the requirements
of
being on strict protection, and has not been a problem inmate.  His
disciplinary record in the prison is minimal and is not of
the kind to suggest
that he has been accustomed to behaving in a violent fashion, or otherwise in a
way which would suggest any significant
ongoing behavioural problems, within
the strict confines of that environment.
<P>

<b>RESOLUTION OF THIS APPLICATION</b>
<P>

60  	The case is one of some difficulty, having regard to the
relative youth of the applicant at the time of committing an offence
of such
hideousness as to place it in the most serious category, and also having regard
to the fact that there was no apparent justification
or reason for him to
behave in this fashion.  Moreover, his case has proved to be of some difficulty
in assessment by the psychiatrists.
 I am, in these circumstances, left with
some concern as to whether he has ever at any time been entirely frank when
discussing the
offence with them, or for that matter, with anyone else.
However, there have been no ongoing signs of mental disorder of any significant
kind other than the antisocial personality disorder previously diagnosed.
<P>

61  	The problem that I face is that until very recently, the
applicant has simply failed to appreciate the seriousness of his criminality
and has offered very little by way of remorse.  Additionally, for many years,
he has turned his back on the many attempts which have
been made to encourage
him to seek psychological assistance, or to join one or other of the sexual
offender diversionary programmes.
 His attitude seems to have consistently been
one of denial; although, in very recent times, at face value, he has begun to
express
remorse and greater insight, as well as having undertaken the step of
entering the preparatory SORT programme.  Whether that step
was taken to
enhance this application or was a step genuinely motivated by remorse and
insight, remains to be tested.
<P>

62  	But for the possible emergence of the encouraging signs
mentioned, and his greater maturity, this is a case where a life sentence
would
indubitably still be appropriate.  The signs now being somewhat more positive,
although subject to testing, I am of the view
that the application should, at
this stage, be dismissed, but that the time for reapplication should be reduced
to a period of 18
months.  Within that period, the applicant will have the
opportunity of undertaking the remainder of the SORT programme, as well
as the
other programmes which Dr Westmore thinks appropriate.  Until those programmes
have been completed, the extent of the  dedication
or commitment of the
applicant to his rehabilitation and the extent to which he presents a
continuing danger to the community, cannot
properly and independently be
assessed.  I consider that it would be inappropriate in the interests of the
community, and unfair
for the applicant, for any determination to be made
today, involving the imposition of a minimum and additional term, and so dealt
with as to preclude or limit the later possibility of fixing a sentence other
than a life sentence..
<P>

63  	In that regard, I have taken into account a number of matters,
including the circumstance that the protection of the society
is an element of
consequence to be considered, along with the point made in decisions such as
<b>Cribb</b>, Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1994,  <u>Lanigan</u> (Court
of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 31 August 1992) and <u>Dennis</u> (Court of
Criminal Appeal New South Wales 28 October 1992), that an application of this
kind should not normally be refused unless
the appropriate sentence is one for
the remainder of the applicant's natural life, and that its dismissal should
not result in the
offender being required to serve a longer period in gaol than
the commission of the offence requires.
<P>

64  	I have similarly taken into account the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17(1)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>; and in particular have not overlooked the demarcation
between the powers of the Supreme Court under s 13A, and those of the Parole
Board under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17(1).</a>
<P>

65  	The present case is one displaying exceptional circumstances,
having regard to the very recent and yet to be tested change
in the applicant,
from an attitude of denial and resistance to rehabilitation, in a worst case of
murder, to one of possible hope
for the future.
<P>

66  	It also has some similarly to the recent decision of Grove J
in<b> Martin Kluska</b>, 18 December 1998, unreported, in so far as his Honour
there considered it appropriate to take into account the likely minimum term,
which could be imposed if all of the matters in issue turned out in a way which
was wholly favourable for the applicant.  In that
regard, I am more than
satisfied that to delay a redetermination of the matter, for a period of 18
months from today, would not operate
to the applicant's disadvantage.  If it
becomes appropriate, in the light of his further progress, for a determinate
sentence should
be imposed, then it is improbable in the extreme that the
minimum term fixed would be one which would expire prior to any date upon
which
a fresh application could be brought before this court.
<P>

67  	Accordingly, in these special circumstances, I will dismiss this
application, but I will direct that the applicant may present
a fresh
application under s 13A at a date not earlier than a date 18 months from today.
To that extent the period of two years otherwise
applicable is reduced.
