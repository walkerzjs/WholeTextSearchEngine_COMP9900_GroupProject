<P>

<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	The prisoners, Aaron Lee Martin and Sean Leigh Cushman,
appear for sentence following their convictions by a jury on 16 July
1999.
Martin was convicted of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily
harm on Brian Hagland with intent to do so. 
Cushman was convicted on a charge
of being an accessory after the fact of Martin's offence.
<P>

2   	Martin was arraigned on an indictment containing three
counts, of which the second and third were alternative to the first,
but
cumulative upon one another.  The principal charge against him was that, on 7
September 1996, he murdered Brian Hagland.  The
two alternative charges were
that he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Mr Hagland with intent to
cause such harm.  One
of these involved an allegation that Martin engaged in an
act of strangling Mr Hagland.  The other involved an allegation that he
kicked
Mr Hagland.  Also left to the jury were the further alternatives of
manslaughter and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily
harm but without the
specific intent to cause such harm.  The jury having convicted of the offence
which included the element of
specific intent of specific intent, it was
unnecessary to proceed to the statutory alternative.  
<P>

3   	At the end of the Crown case in respect of the count of
maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent by kicking,
I directed
the jury to return a verdict of not guilty which the jury duly did.  After
deliberation the jury found Martin not guilty
of murder and not guilty of
manslaughter but guilty of the surviving charge of maliciously inflicting
grievous bodily harm with intent
to do so.
<P>

4   	Cushman was arraigned on a single charge that he was an
accessory after Martin's malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm
with
intent and was convicted on that count.  Although an alternative charge that he
was an accessory after the fact of the malicious
infliction of grievous bodily
harm (but without specific intent) was left to the jury, having regard to its
verdict on the principal
charge, it was unnecessary for the jury further to
consider that alternative or to return a verdict with respect to it.
<P>

5   	It is now my task for sentencing purposes to determine the
facts of the offences, consistent with the jury's verdicts.  The
circumstances
of the charges, the acquittals, and the verdicts of guilty present a complex
fact finding exercise.  It is necessary
to delineate with some particularity
the facts I find as the basis for sentence.  At the outset it is necessary to
repeat that the
offence for which I have to sentence Martin is the single
offence on which he was convicted by the jury.  It is no part of my sentencing
function to punish him because the events which I am about to recount resulted
in the death of Mr Hagland.  While it is impossible
to forget the tragic
outcome of these events, it is to be steadily borne in mind that the jury, who
heard the whole of the evidence
and who deliberated for some days, found him
not guilty of the major offences.  Nor is it any part of my function - or that
of anybody
else - to question the jury's verdict, or to attempt to discern the
basis on which they reached that verdict.  It may be that different
members of
the jury arrived at the same verdict by different means.  In any event the fact
is that the jury were not satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that Martin was
guilty of any offence causing death.
<P>

6   	It was the Crown case that on the evening of 7 September
1996, Martin, together with some associates including Cushman, was
drinking at
the North Bondi RSL Club.  Martin was intoxicated and became progressively more
aggressive as the evening wore on.  He
engaged in a significant act of
vandalism at the Club, breaking the glass pane of a toilet door with his fist,
and threatened to
throw a stool at the bar.  His behaviour led Cushman to take
him from the Club, intending to help him into a taxi to take him home,
before
himself returning to the Club.  En route from the Club, Martin engaged in many
additional acts of vandalism and aggression.
 His hand was bleeding from the
injury he had suffered in smashing the glass in the door at the Club and he
smeared blood on buildings
through which he and Cushman passed.  He broke the
glass door of a restaurant which they passed.  He behaved aggressively towards
individuals the two encountered.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
for a sustained period he was in a belligerent and
antagonistic mood, and that
this mood was reflected in his general behaviour.
<P>

7   	Near Campbell Parade, Cushman and Martin encountered Mr
Hagland and his companion, Ms Connie Casey.  Martin and Mr Hagland
quickly
became embroiled in a serious physical fight.  At one point Mr Hagland was on
the ground, the whites of his eyes showing,
with Martin's hands around his
neck, strangling him.  This was the act that constituted the offence of
maliciously inflicting grievous
bodily harm with intent, on which the jury
convicted.  Later, the two men were standing, locked together physically in
something
like a wrestling position.  Mr Hagland was able to bite into Mr
Martin's chest, inflicting a wound of considerable seriousness. 
Precisely what
happened thereafter can only be determined by inference, there being no eye
witness who could give an accurate account.
 What is clear, however, is that Mr
Hagland was struck by a bus, and sustained massive multiple injuries that
caused his death. 
The Crown case in support of the charge of murder and the
alternative of manslaughter was that Martin deliberately and knowingly
threw Mr
Hagland into the path of the bus.
<P>

8   	Cushman remained on the periphery.  He played no part in
these events.   A little while after, he met Martin in a nearby park,
hailed a
taxi and directed the driver to take Martin home.  It was this assistance that
constituted the accessorial offence alleged
against him and which the jury
found to have been proved.
<P>

9   	It was alleged in the Crown case, and denied by Cushman,
that Cushman gave the driver money for the fare.  It is unnecessary
to resolve
this conflict since it makes not the slightest difference for sentencing
purposes.
<P>

10   	The Crown has invited me to find that Martin's behaviour
that night constituted a vicious, sustained and unremitting attack,
late at
night, in a public place, on a complete stranger, by a drunken man who had a
history of being violent after consuming alcohol;
 and that the assault was
committed with intent to cause very serious injury to Mr Hagland;  and that
such injury was in fact caused.
 Some of these facts are necessarily implicit
in the jury's verdict.
<P>

11   	In order to determine whether this series of propositions
(and which of them) can be sustained it is necessary to examine,
firstly, the
evidence concerning the commencement of the encounter between the two men.
<P>

12   	I am satisfied that Martin was in a very intoxicated
state, and his intoxication manifested itself in the aggressive and
uncontrolled
behaviour I have already described.
<P>

13   	A significant issue concerns the circumstances in which Mr
Hagland and Mr Martin came into physical conflict.  The Crown has
urged that I
should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Martin was the sole aggressor
and  that he launched an attack on Mr
Hagland that was entirely unprovoked.
The nearest eye witness at the confrontation was Ms Casey.  As she described
the encounter,
Martin came towards Mr Hagland, moving aggressively, his eyes
staring wildly.  She described the movement as like shadow boxing,
Martin
dancing on the balls of his feet.  His behaviour prompted her to tell Mr
Hagland not to look at him, and to endeavour to walk
past the men without any
trouble.  She said Mr Hagland said that he did not want any trouble, he was
just going home.  She said Martin
punched out at the top of Mr Hagland's chest,
Mr Hagland tried to push him away, and the two shortly after were lying on the
ground
with Mr Hagland's head in the gutter.  She said Martin then was pressing
down on Mr Hagland who was a very big, healthy, fit man
but, who was
nonetheless overcome by Martin. 
<P>

14   	In contrast, evidence was given by two other witnesses who
observed the commencement of the confrontation.  Mr Paul Green
saw the two men
as they passed each other and saw them turn around.  He heard Mr Hagland twice
ask Martin to repeat what he had said
although Mr Green had not heard any
remark from Martin.  He gave no evidence of observing the behaviour described
by Ms Casey on
the part of Martin.  Mr Green crossed to the other side of the
road and heard a loud thumping sound, turned around and saw the two
men lying
on the ground.  
<P>

15   	Mr Khufu Amon Ra happened to be looking out of the window
of his nearby second floor flat when he saw the two men meet.  He
did not hear
any words but observed what was apparently an exchange of words, with Mr
Hagland turning around to say something.  Mr
Amon Ra moved away for a few
minutes and then returned to the window and saw the two men scuffling and
fighting.  He also heard Ms
Casey say something to the effect of "Let's just
go".  He said the fight started by the two men grabbing each other somewhere
around
their coats or shirts in the chest or lapel area, and both were pushing
and shoving.  He said that the fight was like wrestling,
each man trying to get
the advantage of the other.   He did not see Martin dancing on the balls of his
feet, or shadow boxing.
<P>

16   	Martin gave a quite different account of the commencement
of the encounter.  He described walking with Cushman from the Club,
and coming
across Mr Hagland and Ms Casey.  He said he made an offensive remark about Ms
Casey which provoked Mr Hagland to ask him
to repeat what he had said, followed
by an invitation to a fight.  Martin claimed that he, that is Martin, said
something to the
effect of: "Do you want to dance?" or "Let's have a go".  He
said that Mr Hagland then put down the items he was carrying and took
a step.
Martin was not sure then who grabbed who first, but he thought the two acted
almost simultaneously.  He denied having moved
in front of Mr Hagland with his
fists up.  He said he was responding to some sort of challenge issued by Mr
Hagland.  
<P>

17   	Cushman also gave evidence in this respect and said that
he heard Mr Hagland asked Martin to repeat what he had said.
<P>

18   	It will be seen that there is significant variance between
the account given by Ms Casey on the one hand, and the accounts
given by the
remaining four witnesses on the other.  On Ms Casey's account, no aggression or
provocation or, indeed, participation,
could be attributed to Mr Hagland before
Martin descended upon him in an entirely unprovoked physical assault.  The
accounts of the
other four witnesses do not support that description.  These
attribute a modest, and I repeat modest, level of involvement at an
early stage
to Mr Hagland.  
<P>

19   	The Crown invited the jury, as it has invited me, to
prefer the description given by Ms Casey to that of the two prisoners
and the
witnesses, Messrs Green and Amon Ra.  It was put that, as  Ms Casey was closer
to what was happening, and was more intimately
involved, she was therefore more
likely to be an accurate observer.  There is a certain amount of logic in that
proposition, but
it is not the whole of the story.  I do not think it is
possible to accept it in its entirety and certainly not to the standard
necessary
for a finding of fact adverse to Martin for sentencing purposes,
which must be a finding beyond reasonable doubt.  The accounts given
by Martin,
Cushman, Messrs Green and Amon Ra interlock in a fashion that excludes a
finding beyond reasonable doubt of the contrary
proposition.  In this respect
the evidence of the independent witnesses is most significant.  Messrs Green
and Amon Ra were uninvolved
and may be taken to have an objectivity that cannot
be attributed to any of the other three.  I accept that Ms Casey was closer to
what was happening, but her intimate involvement and her obvious fear at the
time tinges her account in a way that makes it  necessary
to give careful
attention to the evidence of the two independent observers.  In my opinion, the
most likely scenario is that Martin
did indeed make the offensive remark of
which he gave evidence and that this was a provocative event, inciting a
response from Mr
Hagland of the kind described, and that the two men thereupon
mutually and virtually simultaneously became involved in a physical
fight which
rapidly escalated and went out of control.
<P>

20   	It is next necessary to consider the act of maliciously
inflicting grievous bodily harm.  This, as I have said, was constituted
by  the
attempt to strangle Mr Hagland.  In this respect the only direct evidence is
that of Ms Casey and of Martin.  Ms Casey described
this event in the following
way:
<P>

"I could see his back and his arms.  Basically it was like he was doing some
sort of press-up, he was holding his upper body up
on Brian and the hands were
going backwards and forwards.  Brian was flat out underneath him.  The only
thing I could see moving
of Brian was his feet at that point.  Still trying to
move his legs off him." 
<P>

21   	Martin also described this event.  He said that the two
men grabbed each other, they hit the ground and were rolling around,
wrestling.
He said that he knew that if he did not do something Mr Hagland would cause him
serious injury.  He said:
<P>

"I think that's when I put my hands around his neck and tried, sort of tried to
get the better of him and then I felt something
on me back, I think that was
the lady with the handbag..."      (T 853)
<P>

22   	He said that Mr Hagland continued to punch and kick at him
during this time.  He denied that he was attempting to cause Mr
Hagland's
death.
<P>

23   	I do not think there is any material discrepancy between
the two accounts of what Martin did, from an objective point of view.
 In any
event, the jury, by its verdict, found that he did engage in an act of
strangling, and that he did so with intent to inflict
grievous bodily harm and
that he did in fact cause such harm.  It is no part of the offence of which he
stands convicted that he
intended any more serious consequence than that.
<P>

24   	A relevant consideration, however, is the extent of the
injury actually inflicted.  This is not easy to determine, having
regard to
what later happened.
<P>

25   	Isolating the effect of the strangulation is not easy
because of subsequent events, but is necessary because it is for that
offence,
and that offence only that Martin stands for sentence today. There were bruises
to Mr Hagland's neck and there was substantial
medical evidence on this
subject.   
<P>

26   	It will be remembered that Ms Casey said that she could
see the whites of Mr Hagland's eyes during the strangulation.  Dr
Cala, who
gave evidence for the Crown, said that this would suggest that Mr Hagland's
level of consciousness was not normal and that
he was approaching "a near coma
type level of unconsciousness" or a "quite severely diminished level of
consciousness".  He thought
this description was consistent with the bruising
observed to Mr Hagland's neck , although he added that other explanations may
have
existed to account for part of the bruising.  These explanations included
injuries inflicted by the bus at a later point.  However,
Dr Cala thought that
the bulk of the bleeding that caused the bruising could have been due to the
attempts at strangulation. 
<P>

27   	Dr Cala's opinion in this respect was slightly complicated
by the fact that he believed that, on the assumption that Mr Hagland
had been
injured as described, it would be unlikely that he would make a full and rapid
recovery to the condition he was in before
the strangling.  He did not think it
likely Mr Hagland would have been able to fight back as hard as the evidence
shows that he did.
 In this respect the fact that he was able to inflict a very
serious bite on Martin is of some significance.   Moreover, Mr Hagland
was,
after the strangling incident, in a standing and wrestling position with
Martin.  Dr Cala considered that this did not necessarily
indicate an ability
to stand, move, and fight unaided, but may have meant that he gained the
strength to do so by clinging to Martin.
<P>

28   	It is not possible to determine with any degree of
accuracy precisely what injury was inflicted on Mr Hagland as a consequence
of
the strangulation by Martin, but exclude the later events which are not
relevant for sentencing purposes.  What is clear is that
it was a very serious
incident during the course of the fight.
<P>

29   	On behalf of the Crown it was accepted that, for the
purpose of this determination, no regard can be paid to the more serious
injuries subsequently suffered by Mr Hagland.  The enquiry as to the objective
circumstances of the offence with which I am dealing
stops at the point where
Martin's hands were removed from Mr Hagland's neck.  Thereafter, Mr Hagland was
able to rise to his feet,
although it may have been with the assistance of
Martin in grappling with him.
<P>

30   	As I have said, it is plain that the offence is a very
serious one.  One indication of its seriousness is that the legislature
has
seen fit to prescribe a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty-five
years.  
<P>

31   	It is necessary to consider some other matters.  The Crown
argued that Martin's intoxication ought be seen, for the purpose
of sentencing,
as an aggravating factor.  It is well established that intoxication may, in
some circumstances be an aggravating feature,
and in others a mitigating
factor.  What is plain here is that Martin's level of intoxication contributed
to the events which preceded
and gave rise to the offence.  Moreover, this was
not the first time alcohol had played a part in leading him into criminal
behaviour,
a matter to which I will return.
<P>

32   	In the present case I accept the submission on the part of
the Crown that Martin's intoxication is a matter of aggravation.
<P>

33   	Martin was born on 9 January 1974.  He was twenty-two
years of age at the time of the offence.  He is now twenty-five years
of age.
His criminal history commenced in 1987 when he was but thirteen years of age
and he was charged in the Children's Court with
possession of implements
capable of entering a conveyance.  Thereafter he was back before the Children's
Court on a number of occasions
in respect of offences of dishonesty and on one
occasion of assault.  As an adult he has appeared before the Local Court on a
charge
of malicious damage, offences associated with the use of motor vehicles,
assault and dishonesty.
<P>

34   	Significantly, in August 1993 he pleaded guilty to and was
convicted on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
 For this
offence he was sentenced to a term of penal servitude of fifteen months, made
up of a minimum term of six months and an
additional term of nine months.  He
was then nineteen years of age.  The Crown urged that considerable weight
should be given to
that offence as it bears disturbing similarities to the
present.  The Crown sought to adduce evidence of the offence in the trial.
 I
rejected the evidence for that purpose, but that does not mean that it is not
relevant to be taken into account for sentencing
purposes.
<P>

35   	The offence was committed in the early hours of Saturday
26 September 1992.  The victim was walking on a suburban road when
he was
approached by Martin who grabbed the headphones of the radio he was listening
to, pulled them off his head, and demanded to
know what the victim was laughing
at.  Martin then punched him in the face causing his nose to bleed and the
victim to fall.   While
the victim was on the ground Martin kicked him in the
head with his knees several times, pulled the victim's jacket over his head
and
went through his pockets and demanded the victim's money.  
<P>

36   	Martin was arrested and pleaded guilty to the charge of
assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  As I have said, that offence
has some
disturbing similarities with that of which he now stands convicted.  
<P>

I have the benefit of a pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the
Probation and Parole Service.  It is plain that Martin
has had little stability
in his life and has not developed the necessary discipline to cope with
frustrations of daily life.  He
is reported to have been perceived from an
early age as an angry and frustrated person who would occasionally act
aggressively, and
who would on occasions harm himself to gain attention;  and
also as passive and shy and with little self confidence.  He was the
second
youngest of seven siblings who were raised by their mother after their parents
separated in 1979, when he was five years of
age.  His behaviour was such that
at thirteen he was sent to live with his father as his mother was unable to
control him.  There
were regular instances of truancy from school, and at one
time he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.  No professional
assistance was sought on his behalf.  
<P>

37   	His mother has had her own difficulties apparently with
alcohol abuse and psychiatric illness.
<P>

38   	In addition to the pre-sentence report, there was a
comprehensive report from Ms Robilliard, a psychologist.  This report
was of
considerable significance because Ms Robilliard saw Martin in relation to the
1992 offence and reported to the District Court
judge who sentenced him on that
occasion.  In addition to other psychiatric conditions, Ms Robilliard
identified symptoms of Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder related to the events of
7 September 1996.  
<P>

39   	She was able to make a comparison with her assessment in
1992.  She thought that now Martin was able to offer much greater
insight and
understanding than previously and she gave some details of this.  She considers
that he needs help to control his anger.
 
<P>

40   	He is now in a de facto relationship of ten years
standing, but this may not be altogether a constructive relationship.  Both
he
and his de facto abuse alcohol and use illegal drugs.  This relationship too,
has lacked stability and has been marked by periods
of separation.  There are
two children of the relationship, now aged six years and twenty months.
<P>

41   	There are some positive signs.  Martin was, for a period,
on bail pending trial.  He is said to have improved his behaviour,
and to have
restricted his alcohol intake and become a regular attender at Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings.
<P>

42   	He has expressed contrition for the offence.  I have no
reason not to accept this as genuine.  He gave that evidence during
the trial
and while a certain amount of scepticism is justified in those circumstances,
there are signs that the expression of regret
is genuine.  
<P>

43   	Although he was initially granted bail, it was revoked on
20 August 1998 and he remained in custody thereafter.  A report
from the
Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre records that he has attended
counselling sessions and alcohol and other drug groups
whilst in custody.  He
has also attended educational courses and his literacy has improved.  He would
formerly have been classified
as illiterate and is now able to read and write
to an extent.
<P>

44   	He gave evidence both in the trial and in the sentencing
proceedings.  Much of his evidence on sentencing was to explain the
conduct
which resulted in the revocation of bail.  However, he reiterated his regret
for the events for which he was involved, and
for the loss of Mr Hagland's
life.  He said he has not consumed alcohol since that evening.  He regularly
attends Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings.
<P>

45   	He has spent almost fourteen months in custody referable
to this offence.  Prior to that while on bail he was subject to unusually
stringent conditions.  On his behalf it was suggested that the conditions were
so strict as to amount almost to home detention or
house arrest.  I agree that
the conditions were sufficiently onerous to be taken into account as a factor
in mitigation of sentence.
 On his behalf it was put that he should be given
credit, not only for that period of time in actual custody, but also for the
period
of time on bail when he was subject to significantly restrictive
conditions.  He was, in effect, largely confined to his home and,
indeed, it
was for breach of that condition that his bail was ultimately revoked.  
<P>

46   	I accept that he is to be given some recognition for this
in the sentence to be imposed and I propose to do so.
<P>

47   	Another factor to be taken into account in his favour is
that, on learning of the death of Mr Hagland, he presented himself
to the
police and acknowledged his part in the events of that night.  The account he
then gave was substantially similar to the account
he gave to the jury.
<P>

48   	It is a matter for the utmost regret that it has taken a
tragedy of these proportions to bring this still young man to his
senses.
However, I am satisfied that it is more probable than not that this has
happened and that Martin now has reasonable prospects
for rehabilitation.  He
has taken significant steps towards overcoming his alcohol addiction;  he has
taken significant steps towards
improving his literacy and his educational
attainments;  he has recognised the need for professional help in coping with
the legacy
of his disturbed and his dysfunctional childhood and adolescence.

<P>

49   	After argument I admitted into evidence a statement made
by Ms Casey.  Ms Casey, I understood, was not in Australia at the
time of the
sentencing proceedings and was not available to be questioned about her
statement.  Her statement is compelling.  It
is hardly surprising that she
spoke of the continuing emotional effects upon her of the events of 7 September
1996.  However, there
are a number of reasons why the statement can be given
little weight for sentencing purposes.  One of these is her unavailability
to
expand upon or explain what she has said.  Another is that, understandably,
much of what she wrote was related to Mr Hagland's
death and must, for reasons
already given, be excluded from consideration.
<P>

50   	While I sympathise with Ms Casey, the law does not permit
me, in sentencing, to attribute weight to the matters she has raised
in her
statement.  
<P>

51   	On Martin's behalf it was urged upon me that, taking into
account the two years in which he was subject to the extremely onerous
and
restrictive bail conditions that I have mentioned, and a little over one year
in actual custody, he has effectively served at
least the minimum term of any
sentence which it would be appropriate to impose.  I reiterate that it is
necessary to exclude from
consideration for sentencing purposes the tragic
consequences to Mr Hagland and to Ms Casey.
<P>

52   	In sentencing Martin I must bear in mind only the events
preceding the encounter with Mr Hagland, the physical encounter between
the two
men up to and including the act of strangling for which he has been convicted,
and the effects of that act so far as they
can be determined.  However, as I
have said earlier, that was in itself a very serious offence.  
<P>

53   	For the purpose of sentencing I was referred to a number
of authorities.  Most, if not all, concerned Crown appeals following
inadequate
sentences for offences against s 33. 
<P>

54   	Having regard to the contents of the reports to which I
have already referred, to Martin's clear need for a great deal of
assistance in
relation to his emotional condition and his abuse of alcohol, I find that there
are special circumstances within s
5(2) of the <i>Sentencing Act 1959</i>
justifying a longer than usual additional term.  In the sentence I am about to
impose I take into account the extensive time spent
on bail under stringent and
restrictive conditions.
<P>

55   	I have come to the view that the appropriate sentence is
one of penal servitude for five years, to date from 20 August 1998.
 I propose
to divide that term into a minimum term of two years and three months and an
additional term of two years and nine months.
<P>

56   	I repeat that that sentence is imposed in respect of the
offence for which he was found guilty by the jury.  He is not to
be sentenced
for the death of Mr Hagland.  The jury's verdicts on all charges are to be
accorded due respect.
<P>

57   	I turn now to Sean Lee Cushman.  The part played by
Cushman has been outlined earlier and was relatively small.  Nevertheless,
the
jury found that he was guilty of the offence of being an accessory, and it is
implicit in the verdict that he was aware that
Martin had committed the offence
of which he was convicted.
<P>

58   	It was not contested on behalf of the Crown that up until
the time Martin encountered Mr Hagland, Cushman was behaving responsibly
in
seeking to take his intoxicated friend to a taxi so he would go home.  I am
satisfied in Cushman's favour that he was in fact
acting responsibly until that
time.  The evidence in the trial, including that given by Cushman, establishes
to my satisfaction that
Cushman in fact became irritated by Martin's behaviour,
even after leaving the Club, and at one stage sought to abandon him.  
<P>

59   	Sean Cushman was born on 14 July 1973.  He was
twenty-three years of age at the time of the offence.  He is now twenty-six.
He has a record for offences of dishonesty and motor vehicle offences.  At the
time of this offence he was subject to a recognizance
to be of good behaviour,
imposed on 21 June 1995 and current for the following three years. 
<P>

60   	Cushman did not give evidence in the sentencing
proceedings.  There was before me a pre-sentence report.  He was born in Canada
and with his family migrated to Australia as a child.
<P>

61   	His background had some instability but less than is
frequently seen in this court.  He has been in a de facto relationship
for ten
years and has a son aged six.  The relationship appears to be stable and
supportive.  Despite his apparently stable home
he experienced difficulties at
school and was placed in a psychiatric unit for adolescents.  He has abused
alcohol and has used marijuana.
 
<P>

62   	He has been on relatively stringent bail conditions from
the date of his arrest.  Like Martin, he presented himself to police
and
co-operated in the investigation that followed.  It was pointed out on his
behalf, and I accept, that it was only at a very late
stage that the Crown
indicated its intention to proceed on a charge of accessory after the fact of
maliciously inflicting grievous
bodily harm with intent, as distinct from the
original charge of accessory after the fact of murder.  He had been subject to
the
stress of the original charge for three years.  
<P>

63   	Cushman and his de facto wife and child plan to move to
Wyong where a Housing Commission property is available for them, and
work is
available.
<P>

64   	In my opinion all these circumstances justify my taking a
course that will not subject Cushman to any term of imprisonment.
 I propose to
subject him to a further recognizance subject to conditions.
<P>

65   	<b>Aaron Lee Martin: </b> you are convicted.  You are
sentenced to penal servitude for five years, made up of a minimum term of two
years and three months
commencing on 20 August 1998 and expiring on 19 November
2000, and an additional term of two years and nine months  commencing on
20
November 2000 and expiring on 19 August 2003.
<P>

66   	<b>Sean Leigh Cushman</b>:  you are convicted of the
offence of being an accessory after the fact of the malicious infliction of
grievous bodily harm with
intent.  I defer passing sentence upon you and order
that you be released on recognizance in the sum of $5,000 to be of good
behaviour
for a period of five years and to appear for sentence if called upon
during that time to do so.  It is a further condition of the
recognizance that
you accept the supervision and guidance of the NSW Probation and Parole Service
and in particular that you participate
in any drug and alcohol intervention
program offered or recommended by that Service, and to participate in any other
programme of
counselling offered or recommended by that Service.
<P>
