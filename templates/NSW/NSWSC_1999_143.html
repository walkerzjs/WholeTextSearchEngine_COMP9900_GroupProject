sought an order referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The
respondents argued that (a) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 13A</a> did not apply to summary offences; (b) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt

(2) 	<u>Whether power is an administrative power:</u>
<P>

(a) 	An inquiry directed pursuant to s 474E(1)(a) "by a prescribed person",
following application under s474D(1), is not judicial
in nature (it is a power

<P>

(b) Consideration of an application, referred under Section 474E(1)(b), by the
Court of Criminal Appeal and dealt with as an appeal,
does involve the exercise
of a judicial power, and consideration of an application for referral under
such provision may properly
 be regarded as incidental to the exercise of
judicial power; and hence it is picked up by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary

not s 474(1)(a), this does not give an "altered meaning" to the State

<P>

<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	<b>WOOD CJ at CL:</b>  A preliminary point has arisen in this matter, going
to the jurisdiction of the Court to consider an application made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, for an inquiry into a conviction for an offence arising under
federal law.
<P>

	<b>BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

2	The matter has a long and chequered history.  The Applicants, Neil Pearson
and Neil Pearson &amp; Company Pty Limited, are importers
of commercial laundry
washer-extractors.  A dispute concerning the appropriate customs tariff
classification, and the rate of customs
duty, applicable to the machines
imported by them, came before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and was
determined on 1st August
1989.  This was followed by an information, charging
the applicants with various offences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/s234.html" class="autolink_findacts">S234</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a> (Cth),
that was laid in the Local Court.
<P>

3	Before that matter came on for hearing, appeals to the Federal Court, and to
the Full Federal Court, from the decision in the
Administrative Appeals
Tribunal, were heard and determined on 27 June 1990, and 8 March
1991,respectively.
<P>

4	The information came on for hearing, before Magistrate Gould, in
August/September 1991.  The applicants were convicted, in respect
of fourteen
charges, on 11 September 1991, and pecuniary penalties were imposed.  They then
appealed to the District Court, pursuant
to s122 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.
<P>

5	The de novo appeal came before Hosking DCJ, and was heard by him, over
several days, during August 1993 and March 1994.   In June
1994, Hosking DCJ
was requested to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  On 1 December
1995, the decision of that Court
was handed down.
<P>

6	The proceedings came back before Hosking DCJ on 2 February 1996.  On that
occasion, after declining applications by Mr. Pearson
and his company, to
reopen their case, and then to state a further case for the Court of Criminal
Appeal, his Honour found the offences
proved and confirmed the convictions that
had been recorded in the Local Court.
<P>

7	On 3 May 1996, an application, in the nature of a certiorari, came before the
Court of Appeal in respect of the rulings made by
Hosking DCJ.  On 12 July
1996, that application was dismissed.  A subsequent application to the High
Court for special leave to appeal
was refused.
<P>

8	It may be taken that in dealing with the offences, the Local Court, and the
District Court, were exercising Federal jurisdiction
conferred pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">SS
39(2)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a>(2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth).
<P>

9	The applicants have now brought an application to this Court pursuant to S
474D of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, for an inquiry into their conviction.  The order
they seek is that the Court refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to
be dealt with as an appeal under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a>  (S474E(1)(b) and
S474 L).
<P>

10	The Attorney General for New South Wales and the Collector of Customs were
notified of the application.  Each foreshadowed an
objection, upon the ground
that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an application of this
kind, where it is brought
by a person convicted of an offence arising under
Commonwealth law.  I determined that it was appropriate to hear argument upon
that
point,, before embarking upon any consideration of the application upon
its merits.  By following this course, I do not regard any
of the parties to
have submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court, or to have otherwise waived
any right to argue the matter, on
the merits, should it be held that this Court
does have jurisdiction to entertain the application.  As the jurisdictional
question
involved a matter arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, notice has been
given to all other States and Territories under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 78B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>.  No
other State or Territory has sought leave to intervene.
<P>

11	The question which arises for determination is whether a person convicted
and sentenced in New South Wales, in respect of a summary
offence under Federal
law, can bring an application for an inquiry into such conviction or sentence,
under Division  3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.
<P>

12	Relevantly, Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> contains the following provisions:
<P>

	"474D	(1)	An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be
made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person
or by another person on
behalf of the convicted person.
<P>

	(2) ... 
<P>

	474E	(1)	After considering an application under section 474D or on its own
motion:
<P>

	(a)	the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a prescribed
person into the conviction or sentence, or
<P>

	(b)	the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal
Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a>.
<P>

	(2)	Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is
a doubt or question as to the convicted person's
guilt, as to any mitigating
circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

	(3)	The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an
application.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme
Court may refuse to
consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

	(i)	has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction
or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from
the conviction or sentence),
or
<P>

	(ii)	has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the repealed
provisions, and
<P>

	(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special
circumstances that justify the taking of further
action.

Supreme Court may consider any written submissions
made by the Crown with
respect to an application.

	(5)	The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to
the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme
Court under this section
(including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).

13	The procedure for, and the action to be taken upon completion of any inquiry
conducted following a direction made under S 474E

<P>

	474H (1)	On completing an inquiry under this Division, the prescribed person
must cause a report on the results of the inquiry
(incorporating a transcript
of the depositions given in the course of the inquiry) to be sent to:
<P>

	(a)	the Governor, in the case of an inquiry held on the direction of the
Governor; or
<P>

	(b)	the Chief Justice, in the case of an inquiry held on the direction of the
Supreme Court.
<P>

	(2) 	The prescribed person may also refer the matter (together with a copy of
the report) to the Court of Criminal Appeal:
<P>

	(a)	for consideration of the question whether the conviction should be quashed
(in any case in which the prescribed person is of
the opinion that there is a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the convicted person), or
<P>

	(b)	for review of the sentence imposed on the convicted person (in any case in
which the prescribed person is of the opinion that
there is a reasonable doubt
as to any matter that may have affected the nature or severity of the
sentence).
<P>

	(3)	After considering a report furnished to the Chief Justice under this
section, the Supreme Court must cause its own report on
the matter (together
with a copy of the prescribed person's report) to be sent to the Governor.
<P>

	(4)	The Governor may then dispose of the matter in such manner as to the
Governor appears just."
<P>

14	In addition, Division 5 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1923224/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> makes provision in relation to matters
referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, as follows:
<P>

	"474L  On receiving a reference under S 474C(1)(b) or 474E (1)(b), the Court
is to deal with the case so referred in the same way
as if the convicted person
had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act
1912</a>, and the Act applies accordingly."
<P>

15	In summary, the points sought to be argued on behalf of the Collector for
Customs, (who took up the matter on behalf of the Commonwealth),
and the State
of New South Wales, are as follows:
<P>

(a)	As a matter of statutory interpretation, the power  to refer a case to the
Court of Criminal Appeal under S 474 E(1)(b) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> is confined to
matters in respect of which an appeal would otherwise lie to that Court, and
hence is not applicable to a case of
the present kind where the applicants were
convicted of a summary offence;
<P>

(b)	As a matter of statutory interpretation, Division 3 of Part 13A <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a> applies only to persons convicted under State laws, and not to Federal
offenders.
<P>

(c)	The power exercised under S 474E(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> is not a judicial
power, or a power incidental or ancillary to such a power, and hence is not
available to be exercised by a State
Court, in respect of a Federal offence, by
reason of the <u>Boilermakers Case</u>  (<u>R v Kirby</u>: ex parte
Boilermakers Society of Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2094%20CLR%20254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 94 CLR 254).</a>
<P>

16	I shall deal with these points in turn, noting before I do that the
Commonwealth does not have a statutory scheme for inquiring
into convictions or
sentences for Federal offences.   <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part VII</a> C of the Crimes Act (Cth) which
deals with pardons, the quashing of convictions and spent convictions, does not
provide any analogous
mechanism for inquiry into convictions for federal
offences,  or any right to seek a review post conviction.

	<b><u>APPLICATION OF DIVISON 3 OF PART 13A OF <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">CRIMES ACT 1900</a> TO OFFENCES
DEALT WITH SUMMARILY</u></b>
<P>

17	It was submitted that, by reason of the existence of the power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
13A</a> (both under S 474C(1)(b) and S 474E(1)(b)), to refer a case to the Court of
Criminal Appeal "to be dealt with <i>as an appeal</i> under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal
Act 1912</a>", it was implicit that the Part can only have application to persons
convicted on indictment, in the District Court or in the Supreme
Court.  This
submission was based on the circumstance that an appeal does not lie to the
Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of convictions
for summary offences dealt
with by Magistrates, or by Judges of the District Court on appeal from
Magistrates, (S 146 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>) (NSW).
<P>

18	Attention was drawn additionally, to the existence of a mechanism, under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>, whereby, after inquiry, the Local Court is
now given jurisdiction to annul  convictions, penalties and orders in summary
proceedings,
upon application by a person, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100d.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 100D)</a> or upon referral by the
Minister, where the holder of that office is "satisfied that a question or
doubt has arisen as to the guilt
of the person or the person's liability for a
penalty." <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S100</a> G).  The existence of such a jurisdiction, it was submitted, is
inconsistent with any legislative intent that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> should extend
to permit an inquiry into convictions for summary offences, whether entered in
the Local Court or in the District Court,
after a hearing de novo following
appeal to that Court.
<P>

19	In reply, the applicants submitted that there was no warrant for reading
down <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> in this fashion.  In advancing this proposition, it was pointed
out that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">S3</a> of the  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, states  that the Sections mentioned in the
Second Schedule, which include the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, "so far as their
provisions can be applied, shall be in force with respect to <i>all</i>
offences ... and in <i>whatsoever Court</i> tried".   Had there been a
legislative intent to limit the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, in the manner
contended, then so it was submitted, it might have been expected that in the
definition section to that Part, (S 474A)
or otherwise, the Act would have so
provided.
<P>

20	This submission was said to derive support from the legislative history,
which in 1992 saw an amendment made to the forerunner
to Part 13A (S475 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act 1900</a>), which had replaced the procedure for post conviction inquiries
introduced by the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1883 (ss 383 and
384), so as to
insert the words "in any Court" into S 475(1).  It then read "whenever, after
the conviction <i>in any Court</i> of any person, any doubt or question arises
as to his guilt...".   The explanatory note to the amending provision stated in
part:
<P>

	"The proposed amendments will enable the Supreme Court to give such a
direction or application by or on behalf of any convicted
person, making it
clear that such a direction may be given in respect of a conviction <i>in any
Court</i> and enable such a direction to be given to <i>any judicial
officer</i>."
<P>

21	When S 475 was itself replaced by Part 13A upon enactment of the Crimes
Legislation (Review of Convictions) Amendment Act 1993,
it was submitted, there
was no manifestation of any intention to do anything other than to broaden (and
not to narrow) the review
procedure:  See the Explanatory note to the Bill and
the Second Reading Speech, Hansard, Legislative Council, 27 October 1993 pp
4487-4488).   
<P>

22	This Act, it may be noted, amended the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal
Act 1912</a>, with the effect of, inter alia, broadening the powers of the person
conducting the inquiry, and of enabling that person to refer
a case to the
Court of Criminal Appeal, for review by it, if that person was of the opinion
that there was a reasonable doubt as
to the guilt of the accused person.  
<P>

23	The 1993 Act, it may be also noted, was further amended by the Crimes
Amendment (Review of Convictions and Sentences) Act 1996,
which amended S 474E
(1) to provide that, after considering an application for an Inquiry into a
conviction, the Court could refer
the whole case to the Court of Criminal
Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal, and to extend the Section to sentences,
as well as
to the proceedings giving rise to conviction and sentence.  Its
obvious purpose was to clarify and improve the procedure for review
(see the
Second Reading Speech, Hansard, Legislative Council 12 September 1996, pp
4095-4096).
<P>

24	In relation to the existence of the review mechanism under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act
1902</a>, it was submitted, that those provisions had no application where the
conviction was entered in the District Court, following a rehearing,
since the
Part was prescribed as applicable to "review procedures for convictions,
penalties and orders made <u>by magistrates</u> in summary proceedings." <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S
100A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>)  
<P>

25	Even if this Part could apply to permit a magistrate to review a conviction
for a summary offence, confirmed in the District
Court, then it was submitted,
this would not necessarily bar review by the Supreme Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A.</a>
Being a remedial provision, it was argued, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> should be interpreted
beneficially (<u>Varley v Attorney General </u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2024%20A%20CrimR%20413" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 24 A CrimR 413</a> at 428) so
as to afford the utmost relief which the fair meaning of its language would
allow:  see also <u>The Pieve Superiore: Giovanni Dapueto v Wyllie &amp; Co</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%20LR%205%20PC%20482" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) L.R. 5 P.C. 482</a> at   492;  cited with approval by Street CJ in
<u>Fleming v White</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20719" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 719</a> at 722, where his Honour also
observed, relevantly for the submission earlier noted, that "a Court of Petty
Sessions is in every
sense a Court:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>, S 5" (ibid)
<P>

26	In the <u>Application of Mathews</u> (Supreme Court of New South Wales 10
June 1994, unreported) Abadee J, did in fact entertain an application under S
474D of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, in relation to a summary conviction in the Local Court
upon a charge of offensive conduct.  No question as to jurisdiction was raised,
the application being dismissed upon the basis that no doubt or question as to
jurisdiction was raised.
<P>

27	The extension of jurisdiction to summary offences was not the subject of
express discussion in the explanatory notes, or in the
Parliamentary debates,
at the time of the various amendments, save so far as the width of the
expressions variously employed might
suggest that the legislature intended to
include those offences in the review procedure.  The point at issue is a
significant one,
since if the applicant's submission is correct then the reach
of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> is exceedingly wide.
<P>

28	That it was intended to be so wide is by no means clear.  By reason of the
nature of the right of appeal to the District Court,
conferred in relation to
summary offences (Division 4 of Part 5 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> and see also S 132C), and
the limitations upon removal of such matters to, or intervention by, the
Supreme Court (see Divisions 1
to 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a>, of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>, and also <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s146.html" class="autolink_findacts">S
146</a> of that Act)   it is at least  questionable whether Part 13A should be
constructed so as to apply to summary offences, thereby permitting
an
additional means of review by a Court, which clearly was not intended to act as
a court of criminal review for summary matters,
save to a limited extent.
<P>

29	The discretion to refer a matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal,
exercisable by the Minister in response to a petition made
to the Governor (S
474C (1)(b) and (c)), by a Supreme Court Justice ( S 474E(1)(b), and by a
prescribed person following inquiry
under Division 4 (S 474H (2)), is a central
element of Part 13A.  The fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no
independent jurisdiction
to entertain appeals from convictions or sentences in
summary matters, or to intervene in relation to such matters save upon a
limited
basis, might tend to suggest that the Part was intended to be confined
to convictions and sentences entered upon indictment, which
are amenable to
appeal in that Court, and if appropriate, to an order that any such conviction
or sentence be quashed or varied.
  Upon that basis, it might well be said that
the relevant provisions "<i>can(</i><cite>not)</cite> be applied" in relation
to summary offences <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>).
<P>

30	Further it is certainly well arguable that the introduction of a specific
regime for the review of convictions, penalties and
orders by magistrates in
summary proceedings <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s4a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Part 4A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>) is consistent with a legislative
understanding and intention that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> does not apply to summary
offences.  In this regard it may be noted that S 100P  of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>
provides:
<P>

	"An application may not be made by a person under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s4a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Part 4A)</a> if an appeal or an
application for leave to appeal has been made by the person under this Act to
the Supreme Court, the District
Court or the Land and Environment Court".
<P>

31	It may also be noted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 111</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> provides:
<P>

	"(1) Any person who appeals under the provisions of this Division against any
determination of a Justice or Justices from which
he might appeal to the
District Court or the Land and Environment Court shall be taken to have
abandoned such last mentioned right
of appeal.
<P>

The reference to an appeal "under the provisions of this Division" is a
reference to an appeal by way of case stated to the Supreme
Court.
<P>

32	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 111</a> continues:
<P>

	(2)	Nothing herein shall in any way interfere with, curtail or limit the
powers of any person to apply for an order of prohibition
against the
determination of any Justice or Justices."
<P>

33	Where a conviction is recorded following an appeal to, and hearing de novo
in, the District Court, such Court has power, inter
alia, "by its order" to
"<i>confirm</i> ... the conviction, order, sentence or adjudication appealed
against" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 125</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>)  Additionally, S 130 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> provides:
<P>

	"Where any such appeal has been decided in favour of the respondent any
Justice may issue his warrant of commitment <i>as if no appeal has been
brought</i>".
<P>

34	These provisions provide some support for the proposition that, in relation
to summary offences, the Legislature intended to
limit the extent of potential
review post conviction, and in particular to provide those aggrieved by a
conviction, with a choice
between an application to the Supreme Court by way of
a Stated Case <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 101)</a> or by way of statutory prohibition <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s112.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 112)</a>; or
application to the District Court by way of a hearing de novo <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 122)</a>;  or
application for a review by a Local Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100d.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 100D</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100g.html" class="autolink_findacts">100G</a>).   This would be
consistent with a legislative intention that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> was not
to apply to convictions or sentences in respect to summary offences, whether
recorded or passed in the Local Court or <i>confirmed</i> on appeal in the
District Court.
<P>

35	Additionally, it is arguable that S 474E(1)(b) can be invoked only in
relation to those cases which, from the outset, were capable
of being taken to
the Court of Criminal Appeal.    As I have observed, no right of appeal lies
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>, to the Court of Criminal Appeal, from a summary
conviction that has been entered in the Local Court, or confirmed on appeal by
the
District Court;nor does any such right arise under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act
1912</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of that Act, which provides for a general right of appeal,
confines such right to persons convicted "on indictment".  So far as the
Act
permits appeal in relation to cases decided by Courts in "their summary
jurisdiction", that right is confined to matters heard
in the Supreme Court (S
5AA),  the Land and Environment Court (S 5AB), or the  Court of Coal Mines
Regulation (S 5AC).  Otherwise
the Act extends an appeal right for summary
offences only where they were dealt with as matters "related to" an indictable
offence
in the Supreme Court or in the District Court (S 5AD).  
<P>

36	A matter of the kind the subject of the present application is not a matter
that could ordinarily be dealt with by the Court
of Criminal Appeal, "as an
appeal", as contemplated by S 474E(1)(b).  By its nature it is not justiciable
in the Court of Criminal
Appeal, and any appeal to that Court would have to be
dismissed for want of jurisdiction. 
<P>

37	On the other hand, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> in conjunction with the Second
Schedule does make it clear that the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> "So far as these
provisions can be applied, shall be in force with respect to <i>all
offences</i> ... and in <i> whatsoever Court</i> tried".   S 474L is capable of
being read as empowering, and directing, the Court of Criminal Appeal to deal
with a matter referred
to it "in the same way" <i>as if</i> it were an appeal
that was justiciable in that Court.  In that sense it can be regarded as a
source of jurisdiction, enlivened once
a matter is referred under the Part.
<P>

38	Having regard to the matters outlined, it may be somewhat burdensome, if not
excessive, for  there to be an additional and independent
right to seek review
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, in relation to summary offences.  I am not ,
however, persuaded that the words of general ambit in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 3</a> and in the Second
Schedule to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, can be lightly disregarded, or that this ground of
objection to jurisdiction has been made good.

<P>

39	There has been some precedent for the review under legislation analogous to

federal offences, eg <u>The Queen v Collie</u> (Court of Appeal, Victoria, 18
December 1992 unreported, and <u>Perrier v Kerr</u>, Ryan J, Federal Court of
Australia, 19 August 1997 unreported.
<P>

40	These decisions were, however, concerned with applications for referral,
based upon petitions for mercy presented under S 584
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> (Vic)
1958, which provides:

	"Nothing in this Part shall effect the prerogative of mercy, but the

indictment or to the sentence passed on a person so convicted, may, if he
thinks
fit, at any time either -

	(a)	refer the whole case to the Full Court and the case shall then be heard

furnish the Attorney-General with their opinion thereon accordingly."
<P>

41	In <u>Perrier v Kerr</u> the Court was concerned with the question whether
the refusal of the Minister, to refer the applicant's petition for mercy to the
Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, was reviewable under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative

	"It was the submission of Counsel for the applicant and not by Counsel for the

to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a sentence imposed by the

<P>

42	In <u>Collie</u> the applicant's petition for mercy was referred by the
Attorney General (Commonwealth) to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to
S
584.  In the judgment of that Court it was noted that:
<P>

	"Counsel for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (who adopted the
role of respondent upon the hearing of the referred
petition) expressly
conceded that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the reference of the
Commonwealth Attorney-General:  <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68(2)"</a>
<P>

In <u>Saxon</u> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 21 April 1998
unreported) the Commonwealth conceded that, subject to referral by the
Minister, the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales could entertain a
matter, involving a conviction upon indictment for a
federal offence, initiated
under Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, at least so far as S 474C(1)(a) and (b) were
concerned.
<P>

43	By reason of the concession made in these cases, and by reason of the
difference in the basis upon which the jurisdiction was
sought to be enlivened,
they provide only limited assistance in relation to the present case, and in
particular in relation to the
question whether Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> should be
read down as confined to convictions arising under State law.
<P>

44	The submission in this regard was expressly confined to Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
13A</a>, since the exercise of the administrative power, that is required
preparatory for a reference under Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, is vested in an
individual, and not in a Court or Judicial Officer (S 474C(1)).
<P>

45	Reference was made to the decision of Barr J, in the Application of <u>James
William Shepherd</u> (New South Wales Supreme Court, 13 September 1996
unreported).  The application in that case was for an inquiry into a sentence.
It failed for two reasons:  first, by reason of his Honour's conclusion that,
as a matter of construction, Division 3 as it was then
enacted, before the 1996
amendments), was concerned only with inquiries into convictions and not into
sentences;  and secondly, by
reason of the conclusion that the "scheme set
forth in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> (was) intended to enable applicants to apply only in respect
of Sate convictions".  
<P>

46	In dealing with this second ground, his Honour said, 
<P>

	at pp 6-7:
<P>

	"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 12(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act 1987</a> provides that in any Act reference
to a locality, jurisdiction or other matter or thing is a reference to such
locality, jurisdiction
or other matter or thing in and of New South Wales.  The
intention of s 12(1)(b) is to provide the natural limit of legislation so
that
it applies in its subject matter to those situations which have a nexus with
New South Wales:  <u>O'Connor v Healey</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2069%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 69 SR (NSW) 110</a> per Jacobs J
at 114 (where his Honour was discussing s 17, Interpretation Act, 1897, an
earlier version of the rule).  Pt13A lacks
any specific indication of an
intention to apply to a conviction for a Commonwealth offence and that in my
view is sufficient to
lead to the conclusion that it does not so apply:
<u>Grollo v Bates</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2053%20FCR%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 53 FCR 218</a> at 242.  It seems to me therefore that
the word `conviction' as used ins 474D must mean conviction for a New South
Wales offence.
<P>

	This construction seems consistent with the scheme of Pt 13A which, like its
predecessors, operates as a statutory means open to
a convicted person to apply
to the Crown for the exercise of the prerogative of mercy.  See <u>White v The
King</u>;  <u>Varley v Attorney General</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 30.</a>  It is the
Governor who has power to receive reports and consider whether to pardon - see
s 474H(3), (4).  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> "Governor" means, except in
respect of the exercise of the pardoning power, the Governor with the advice of
the Executive Council.
 See also Interpretation Act s 14.  It does not appear
why it should be any business of the Governor of New South Wales to be
pardoning
offences other than New South Wales offences.
<P>

	S 474E(4) provides that this Court might consider any written submissions made
by the Crown with respect to an application.  By
s13(b) of the Interpretation
Act this means the Crown in the right of New South Wales, not of the
Commonwealth of Australia.
<P>

	For these reasons it seems to me that the scheme set forth in Pt 13A is
intended to enable applicants to apply only in respect
of State
convictions."
<P>

47	The reasons so expressed were embraced by the objectors in this case.
Additionally, Counsel argued that the reference to "the
Minister," in S
474E(5), was to be read as a reference to the Minister administering the Act,
namely the relevant State Minister
- S 15(2)(a) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act 1987</a> (NSW).

<P>

48	Reliance was also placed upon the fact that in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 4(1)</a>, and in
the Interpretation Act (NSW) (S14), the "Governor" was defined as  "the
Governor,  with the advice of the Executive Council",
which Council is itself
defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 21</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</a>, to mean "the Executive Council of
New South Wales".  
<P>

49	The question whether Part 13A of the Crimes Act (NSW) was made applicable to
federal offences, by reason of s 68 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth), was expressly not
considered in <u>Shepherd</u>, having regard to the first basis upon which the
application was found to be not justiciable.  Accordingly, it does not stand as
an authority in the way of the applicants.
<P>

50	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> provides (so far as relevant):

is conferred on the several
Courts of that State or Territory by this
section.

	(2)	The several Courts of a State or Territory exercising jurisdiction with

charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.
<P>

51	It was submitted by the applicants that the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> of the

of any ... conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith" (s
68(1)(d) and hence constitute a "law of a State"
as contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68(1)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>.  It was further submitted that reference to the New South
Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</a> was of no assistance in determining the applicability
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> to federal offenders, since the relevant legislative intent was
that of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The real question, so it was
submitted,
was whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> was one of the statutory laws of a State that was
contemplated, as being taken up by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>.
<P>

52	In response to the submission that found favour in <u>Shepherd</u>, it was
argued by the applicants that it was appropriate to adapt, analogously, the
relevant State law to the context of a Commonwealth
offence, since to do
otherwise would be to deprive <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of any meaning.  So it was that in

	`... is read as meaning that the jurisdiction is to be restricted to hearing
appeals by persons designated by the State Act, it
becomes nugatory, because
neither persons convicted on New South Wales indictments nor the Attorney
General of New South Wales could
have any concern with appeals arising out of
trials or convictions for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth'
<P>

	This provides a sound reason for concluding that in the application of s 68(2)

(<i>Williams v The King

54	<u>Peel</u> was applied in <u>Rohde</u> (by Gibbs CJ, Mason and Wilson JJ at
629, and by Brennan J at 630)  in holding that in the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68(2)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>, in relation to S 567A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1958</a> (Vic), the
adoption of the State law proceeded by analogy.  In the absence of an express
power conferred on the Commonwealth Director
of Public Prosecutions with
respect to appeals, the appropriate analogy to the Victorian Director of Public
Prosecutions was held
to be the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth.  The
right to appeal under S 567A(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> (Vic) 1958 was accordingly
invested in the holder of that office, and indirectly in the Commonwealth

<P>

57	It was conceded by the applicants that, in order to make good the claim to
jurisdiction, it was necessary for them to show that
the jurisdiction to
conduct an inquiry, under Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, falls within the expression
"the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or
conviction or out of any
proceedings connected therewith", as that expression
appears in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68(1)(d)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>.  It was accepted that
the remaining paragraphs (a) to (c)of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68(1)</a> were of no assistance.
<P>

58	An inquiry under this Part, or more specifically an application for an
Inquiry, does not comfortably fall within the relevant
expression.  Such an
inquiry or application would not, in normal usage of the language, involve a
"hearing or determination of an
appeal" arising out of any ... trial or
conviction, or out of any proceedings connected therewith".  
<P>

59	The question which arises, however, is whether for the purposes of the
present exercise, the extended definition of "appeal"
contained in S3 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>, makes a difference.  By that Section, "appeal" is defined to
include: 
<P>

	"an application for a new trial and any proceeding to <i>review</i> or <i>call
in question</i> the proceedings decision or jurisdiction of any Court or
Judge." 
<P>

60	This calls for consideration of the meaning of the expression "proceeding to
review or call in question ...", and in particular
whether in the definition
Section, the Legislature had in mind an application of the kind now before the
Court.    The expression
"proceeding" has been given a wide meaning to include
for example any step in an action (<u>Pryor v City Office Co</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2010%20QBD%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 10 QBD
504</a> at 507-508 per Brett MR), or a method permitted by law for moving a Court
or Judicial Officer to some authorised act (<u>Cheney v Spooner</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1929/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2041%20CLR%20532" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 41

<P>

61	In <u>Federated Amalgamated Government Railway and Tramway Service
Association v New South Wales Railway Traffic Employees Association</u> (1906)
4 CLR 488 Griffith CJ said at 494 :
<P>

	"The word `proceeding' is a term of very wide appreciation.  In my opinion the
term `proceeding before the Court' (as used in S
31(2)  of the Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904) includes every matter brought before the
president in the exercise
of the Judicial functions conferred upon him by the
Act."
<P>

62	In <u>Colpitts v Australian Telecommunications Commission</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2070%20ALR%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 70 ALR
554</a> Burchett J, at 565-566, interpreted the expression `review' as involving as
an integral element the power to alter the result.  
<P>

63	The initial consideration of an application  under S 474D by a Supreme Court
Justice does not include the exercise of any such
power to alter the result.
Such consideration is of a preliminary kind, and is designed to sieve out those
applications that should
be refused and those that should be moved forward.
However, upon reference to it, the Court of Criminal Appeal would have such
power.
  Additionally, it could legitimately be said that the purpose of an
application under Division 3, Part 13A is to "call in question"
 the relevant
decision.  This brings me to the constitutional question.
<P>

64	The objectors submitted that, as a matter of constitutional law, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a> cannot pick up Division 3, of  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, because the nature of
the power or function conferred by that Division is one of an administrative
rather than a judicial kind.
 The applicant's response was that the power under
S 474E involves a power "incidental to a judicial function", and hence its
adoption
was not beyond power.
<P>

65	It is clear that no power other than a judicial power, or a power or
function incidental to it, may be lawfully conferred by
the Commonwealth
Parliament on State Courts:  <u>British Medical Association v The Commonwealth

135;  and <u>Gould v Brown</u> (1988) 72 ALJR 375.
<P>

66	The question whether or not a function is "incidental to" the exercise of
the Judicial power of the Commonwealth, has been held
to depend upon
considerations such as whether the suggested incidental function has a
"sufficient relation to the principal or judicial
function or purpose to which
it may be thought to be accessory":  <u>R v Kirby</u>; <u>ex parte Boilermakers
Society of Australia</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2094%20CLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 94 CLR 243</a> at 278;  and "whether the incidental
function is `inconsistent with the co-existence of judicial power'":  <u>R v
Federal Court of Bankruptcy;  ex parte Lowenstein</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2059%20CLR%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 59 CLR 556</a> at
567.
<P>

67	The line is not easy to draw.  In <u>The Queen v Davison</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2090%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 90 CLR
353</a>, where it was held that the making, by a Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy, of
voluntary sequestration orders was an impermissible exercise
of judicial power,
Dixon CJ and McTiernan J, in a joint judgment, observed (at 368-369):
<P>

	"The legislature may commit some functions to courts falling within Chapter
III although much the same function might be performed
administratively.  In
the judgment of this Court in <u>Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital v
Thornton</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1953/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1953] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%2087%20CLR%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 87 CLR 144</a>, the observation occurs:
<P>

	`Many functions perhaps may be committed to a court which are not themselves
exclusively judicial, that is to say which considered
independently might
belong to an administrator.  But that is because they are not independent
functions but form incidents in the
exercise of strictly judicial powers.'
<P>

	It is this double aspect which some acts or functions may bear that makes it
so difficult to define the judicial power."
<P>

68	In the present case, it is important that S 474E(4) expressly provides that
"proceedings under this Section are not judicial
proceedings":  see also
<u>Varley v Attorney General</u> (NSW)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1987%208%20NSWLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1987 8 NSWLR 30</a> at 49 and <u>Rendell</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2032%20A%20CrimR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 32 A CrimR 243</a> at 244, where the administrative nature of a post
conviction review was affirmed.  The applicants accepted that the power arising
under S 474(1)(a) is not a judicial power, or one which is incidental to such a
power.  Any inquiry ordered under that sub section
is of an administrative
nature.   
<P>

69	This because the power of a "prescribed person" conducting an inquiry is one
to inquire (S 474G), and to report (S 474H) into
doubts concerning the
convicted person's guilt:  <u>New South Wales v Canellis</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 309</a>
at 330.  The prescribed person conducting the inquiry has no power to decide or
determine the application, a power that has been
regarded as the hallmark of
judicial power:  <u>Lockwood v The Commonwealth</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2090%20CLR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 90 CLR 177</a> at
180.
<P>

70	The determination whether to "direct that an inquiry be conducted by a
<i>prescribed person</i>", in respect of an application brought under S 474D(1)
accordingly does not involve the exercise of a power incidental to a judicial
power.  It follows, as was conceded by the applicants, that the Supreme Court
would be precluded from directing an inquiry under
S 474E(1)(a) in the present
case.  
<P>

71	The question which remains is whether S 474E(1)(b) may yet be validly picked
up by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>.   It may be accepted, as I have observed
earlier, that the power exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal to deal with
a case referred
to it "as an appeal under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a>" does
involve the exercise of judicial power.  Does it follow that the determination
whether to refer an application, brought under
S 474D to that Court (pursuant
to S 474E(1)(b)) may properly be regarded as involving the exercise of a power
incidental to a judicial
power, and hence picked up. 
<P>

72	The exercise to be undertaken by the Supreme Court, in relation to an
application, made under S 474D involves three possible
outcomes:
<P>

	(i)	a direction for an inquiry by a prescribed person (S 474E (1)(a);
<P>

	(ii)	a reference of the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal "to be
dealt with as an appeal" (S 474E (1)(b); or
<P>

	(iii)	a refusal to consider or to otherwise deal with the application (S
474E(3).
<P>

73	By analogy with the principles established in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 79</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>, it would be inappropriate to apply <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68</a> so as to pick up some,
but not all of the otherwise applicable terms, of Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> if to
do so would be to give an altered meaning to the State legislation:  <u>The
Commonwealth v Mewett </u>(1997) 71 ALJR 1102 at 1141 per Gummow and Kirby JJ;
citing <u>Maguire v Simpson</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 362</a> at 376.
<P>

74	It was submitted by the objectors, in this regard, that the Supreme Court
either has jurisdiction or not, and that the constitutional
validity of the
application of Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a> could not depend upon the fact that,
after examining the application,  the Justice considers it appropriate to refer
the matter to
the Court of Criminal  Appeal.  To find constitutional validity
upon so narrow a basis, for what is in essence a preliminary consideration
of
an application, without authority to consider, or to exercise the remaining
option was,  it was argued, contrary to principle.
 
<P>

75	I am not persuaded that to pick up S 474(1)(b) but not S 474E(1)(a), in the
present context is to give the State legislation
an "altered meaning".  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
68(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a> permits the application of State laws "so far as
they are applicable."   Additionally, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act 1987</a> (NSW)
requires that New South Wales legislation be "construed as operating to the
full extent of but not so as to exceed, the legislative
power of Parliament"
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S31(1)).</a>   It further requires that, where a provision of an Act, or the
application of any  such provision, would be construed as being in
excess of
the legislative power of Parliament, then it is to be treated as "a valid
provision to the extent to which it is not in
excess of that power," and the
remainder of the Act, and the application of the provision "shall not be
affected,"  (S 31(2)).
<P>

76	I finally observe in this context, that the decisions in <u>Kesavarajah v
The Queen</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20230" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 230</a>, <u>Brown v R</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 171</a> and
<u>Cheatle v R</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 541</a> provide  examples of the partial picking
up of State laws.  
<P>

77	In <u>Kesavarajah</u>, a question arose as to the fitness of an accused to
be tried for a Commonwealth offence.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1914</a> (Cth) contains
provisions concerning the disposition of an accused who had been found unfit to
be tried, but no provision  as to
the procedure by which the issue of fitness
was to be tried.  It was held that the State law regulating the method of
determining
that issue was picked up by S 68, but the consequences remained to
be determined by Commonwealth law. There was an inconsistency
between the State
and Commonwealth laws concerning that aspect, so that the latter prevailed.
Otherwise the procedural provisions
that were lacking under Commonwealth law
were made applicable through <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 68</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">79</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>. 
<P>

78	In <u>Brown</u>  the Court was concerned with the election that an accused
had under State law <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ja192797/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ja192797/" class="autolink_findacts">Juries Act 1927</a> (SA)) to trial by Judge alone.
By  reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 80</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> it was held by a majority (Brennan,
Deane and Dawson JJ;   Gibbs CJ and Wilson J dissenting) that the State Supreme
Court must sit
with a jury when it exercised federal jurisdiction.  To that
extent, only part of the State legislation was lifted by an application
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>, and there was a difference in the mode of trial
potentially available for State and federal offenders respectively. 
<P>

79	 <u>Cheatle</u> is to like effect so far as it was held by the High Court
that the provisions of a State Act could not, consistently with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 80</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, operate to authorise the conviction of the appellants by majority
jury verdict, in a trial on indictment  for an offence against
a Commonwealth
law.   The effect of the decision was that the relevant State law <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 57(1)</a>
Juries act 1927 (SA) did not apply in relation to the trial of Commonwealth
offences.  The Court expressed its conclusion in the
following terms:
<P>

	"... history, principle and authority combine to compel the conclusion that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
80's</a> guarantee of trial by jury precludes a verdict of guilty being returned in
a trial upon indictment of an offence against a law of
the Commonwealth
otherwise than by the agreement or consensus of all the jurors.   That being
so, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ja192797/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 57</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ja192797/" class="autolink_findacts">Juries Act 1927</a> (SA) cannot, consistently with s 80, operate to
authorise the conviction of either of the appellants by a majority verdict.
Their
convictions were unconstitutional and must be set aside.
<P>

	The conclusion that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ja192797/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> cannot validly apply to authorise the return of a
majority verdict of guilty in the trial on indictment of an offence against a
law
of the Commonwealth does not mean that the South Australian Courts lack
jurisdiction to entertain such trials.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/aia1915230/s22a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22a(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/aia1915230/" class="autolink_findacts">Acts
Interpretation Act 1915</a> (SA) requires that every provision of every Act of the
Parliament of South Australia "be construed so as not to exceed the legislative
power of the State".  In compliance with that directive, the provisions of s 57
must be read down so as not to purport to apply,
of their own force, to the
trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.  The
guarantee of trial by jury contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> does not
preclude the relevant provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth) from otherwise
operating to vest jurisdiction in respect of trials on indictment of offences
against laws of the Commonwealth
and the South Australian Supreme and District
Criminal Courts constituted by a judge and jury.
<P>

80	This decision provides a further example of portion only of a power or
procedure of a State Supreme Court being picked up when
dealing with a federal
offence, compared with its power when dealing with a State offence.
<P>

81	In my view, similar considerations apply in the present case, and that
picking up S 474(1)(b), without S 474(1)(a) does not give
any altered meaning
or application to the State legislation.  The only difference lies in the fact
that, if the Court determines
that an application is suitable for an inquiry,
then, in the case of a conviction or sentence arising under federal law, the
way
in which it is to be determined is limited to that provided in S
474E(1)(b).  Parliament may be taken to have adopted, in this regard,
one of
the modes for determination of the remedy or procedure, which State law
provides, for its  analogous jurisdiction concerning
convictions under State
law.  To that extent the difference is procedural, and not unlike that seen in
<u>Brown</u> and <u>Cheatle</u>, where the State legislation was taken up, but
with restrictions as to the mode of trial, precluding majority verdicts and
trial
by judge alone.  In the present case, if the Court considers that an
application merits review, then one of the two ways prescribed
for its
determination is taken up.
<P>

82	A further question that arises is whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 68(2)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a> should be
read down in this case, so as to avoid a construction that would empower the
Commonwealth to impose upon a State Supreme
Court an obligation to conduct a
function, on its behalf, without the legislative consent of the State in
accordance with the principles
discussed in  <u>R v Humby</u>;  <u>Ex parte
Rooney</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 231</a> at 239 per McTiernan J, and at 240 per Gibbs J,
and at 245-246 per Stephen J. 
<P>

83	It may be recognised that a function or power to consider and conduct a post
conviction inquiry, other than by way of appeal,
does constitute an additional
burden for a State Court.  Such a function or power has no equivalent in the
Common Law of pardon (<u>Varley</u> at 414);  it does not fall within any
inherent jurisdiction; and it depends upon a statutory grant of power.
Although this point
was not fully argued, I am not persuaded that, in accepting
federal jurisdiction in relation to criminal prosecutions, and appeals
generally,  Legislative consent has not also been extended to review of the
kind here under consideration.
<P>

84	In this regard, I observe that some precedent already exists which assumes
the acceptance by State Supreme Courts of jurisdiction
in respect of matters
referred by the Minister under  Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p13a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13A</a>, (<u>R v Lloyd
Saxon</u>, Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 1 April 1998 unreported)
or under analogous provisions in other States.  (see paras 41
and 42 above).
The concession made in Saxon also accepted the partial picking up of S 474C of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> (S 474C(1)(a) and (b) but not (c)).
<P>

85	 For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the Court lacks jurisdiction to
entertain the application made by the applicants
under S 474D (1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act 1900</a>.  I shall hear the parties in relation to any order that may be sought
for costs, or for any deferral of further consideration by
me of the question
whether the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pending
appeal from this judgment.
