<i>Thursday, 10 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1525/94	DEAGOL PTY LIMITED   -v-   HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT OF AUSTRALIA PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before the Court a notice
of motion filed by the defendants, Hospital Equipment of Australia, Paul Graeme
John
Thompson and Wendy McTackett on 4 June 1999.  The respondent to that
notice of motion is the plaintiff, Deagol Pty Ltd.
<P>

2   	Although the notice of motion seeks substantively an order
that the statement of claim be struck out, the hearing of the applicant
proceeded upon the basis that it was not merely the pleading which was the
subject of the plaintiff's application but that the plaintiff
also sought that
the proceedings themselves be dismissed.  The grounds for the application were
threefold: 
<P>

(1)  	That since the plaintiff company was deregistered by the Australian
Securities and Investment Commission on 8 December 1995
the company no longer
has any legal existence and thus does not have the legal capability to maintain
the present proceedings.  
<P>

(2) 	That the proceedings should be dismissed for want of prosecution on the
part of the plaintiff.  
<P>

(3) 	 That no reasonable cause of action is disclosed.
<P>

3   	At the outset, Counsel for the plaintiff made application
for an adjournment of the hearing of the notice of motion.  The ground
for that
adjournment application was that there has been made an application by Robert
Francis Doyle, the principal of the plaintiff
company, for reinstatement of the
plaintiff pursuant to the provisions of section 601AH of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>.  That application for reinstatement has been made by way of summons
filed on 2 June 1999, that is, a little over one week ago. 
The summons is
returnable on 17 June 1999.
<P>

4   	As I understand it, the ground for the adjournment
application was that if the summons for reinstatement of the plaintiff is
successful, then one of the three grounds upon which the defendants rely for
the dismissal of the present proceedings will be removed.
 
<P>

5   	Without finally determining the application for an
adjournment, I adopted the course that I should embark upon the hearing
of the
defendants' notice of motion for dismissal, and that if I reached the
conclusion that, in any event, the proceedings should
be dismissed then, of
course, there would be no purpose in the reinstatement application of the
plaintiff, and that, therefore, I
would not grant the adjournment. If, however,
I arrived at the view that apart from the status of the plaintiff the
proceedings should
not at this stage be dismissed, then I would grant such an
adjournment.  
<P>

6   	It should here be recorded that the evidence discloses that
the only purpose for which Mr Doyle is making the application for
reinstatement
of the plaintiff company is to enable the present proceedings to remain on
foot.  
<P>

7   	I should also here observe that there is, in fact, a
logical and conceptual problem concerning the representation of the plaintiff
in the hearing of the present application, since the plaintiff is not, of
course, in a position to give instructions to a Solicitor
or to authorise
Counsel to be retained on its behalf.  No point, however, was taken by the
defendants upon the hearing of the present
application to challenge the
retainer of Counsel who announced his appearance for the plaintiff.  
<P>

8   	It seems to me, that the proper course has been followed of
allowing Counsel to present the arguments in resistance to the
defendants'
notice of motion.  That Counsel could be regarded as appearing for the
plaintiff, if such be possible, or (probably more
accurately) as Counsel
representing the interests of Mr Doyle.
<P>

9   	The substantive proceedings were instituted by summons
filed on 28 February 1994.  That summons sought injunctive and other
relief.
Subsequently, a statement of claim was filed on 18 April 1994. That statement
of claim alleged breaches by the second defendant
Graeme John Thompson of his
fiduciary duty as a director of the plaintiff company in setting up a business
in competition with the
plaintiff, and also alleged unauthorised payment of
personal expenses with cheques drawn upon the plaintiff company, and further
alleged misuse of confidential information.
<P>

10   	The first defendant appears to have been established by
the second and third defendants.  The third defendant is asserted
in the
statement of claim as having participated in the activities of the first and
second defendants.  
<P>

11   	The defendants, with reasonable promptitude, filed their
defences on 22 May 1994.  The plaintiff did not (as was required
by the Supreme
Court Rules: Part 33 rule 6(1)) set the proceedings down for trial.  The
plaintiff, however, either through itself
or through Mr Doyle personally, had
by then instigated a criminal prosecution against the second defendant, Mr
Thompson.
<P>

12   	Those criminal proceedings against Mr Thompson were heard
in the Local Court at Gosford on 30 and 31 March 1995, and the charges
against
Mr Thompson were dismissed.  In the meantime, however, the plaintiff had been
informed by the Australian Securities Commission
on 8 March 1995 that
deregistration action which the Commission was in the process of taking against
the plaintiff for its failure
to comply with the statutory requirements of
lodging returns had, upon the application of the plaintiff, been deferred for
180 days
from the date of that notice.
<P>

13   	Subsequently, on 16 August 1995 the Australian Securities
Commission gave formal notification to the plaintiff that its registration
would be cancelled and the plaintiff company would be dissolved at the end of
three months from the date of that notice unless cause
be shown to the
contrary.  There is some evidence of telephonic communications between Mr Doyle
and somebody not identified, except
as to gender, at the Australian Securities
Commission.  
<P>

14   	At all events, on 8 December 1995 the plaintiff was
deregistered for failing to file annual returns.  It is said by Mr Doyle
in his
evidence that he was unaware of the fact of that deregistration until, in May
of this year, the solicitors for the defendants,
who had obtained an up to date
company search in respect of the plaintiff, communicated that fact to the
solicitors for the plaintiff.
 The plaintiff had chosen not to file any returns
not only for some years before the deregistration in December 1995 (thus giving
rise to the deregistration action by the Australian Securities Commission) but
for the next three years after that date. 
<P>

15   	The Court must look therefore somewhat askance at the
suggestion by Mr Doyle that he had no idea that the plaintiff company
had been
deregistered on 8 December 1995.  Nevertheless, whether or not Mr Doyle was
aware of that fact, the company had done nothing
in the present proceedings
since it had filed its statement of claim on 18 April 1994, apart from
purporting to serve a notice of
discovery on 17 January 1996.  That notice of
discovery, since the company no longer existed in January 1996, was, of course,
of
no legal effect. The defendants on 1 February 1996 although unaware of the
deregistration of the plaintiff some two months earlier,
objected to the notice
of discovery being served upon them, and the plaintiff did nothing further in
that regard.  
<P>

16   	It was only after the communication of the deregistration
of the plaintiff by the solicitors for the defendants in the letter
of 10 May
1999, to which I have referred, that Mr Doyle made the application returnable
on 10 June 1999 to have the plaintiff reinstated.
<P>

17   	Evidence has been placed before the Court by affidavit of
Richard Michael Barraclough, the solicitor for the plaintiff, sworn
9 June
1999, concerning the conduct of the proceedings (or, more accurately, the lack
of conduct of the proceedings) on the part
of the plaintiff and its legal
advisers.  I do not consider that the material in that letter adequately
explains the very lengthy
delays which have occurred.  
<P>

18   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that
there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay in the conduct of these
proceedings on the part of the plaintiff.  I am in agreement with that
submission.  Part 33 rule 6 (to which I have earlier made
reference) provides,
in subrule (1), that:
<P>

Where a plaintiff does not, within six weeks after the pleadings are closed,
set the proceedings down for trial, the Court, on motion
by any other party,
may, on terms, dismiss the proceedings or make such other order as the Court
thinks fit.
<P>

19   	Some suggestion was made on behalf of the plaintiff that
the plaintiff was justified in not setting the matter down for trial
within six
weeks of the close of pleadings, the pleadings having closed by about mid-June
or late June 1994.  Thus the six week period
had elapsed no later than the end
of August or early September 1994.  The reason proffered as justification for
the plaintiff not
having set the proceedings down for trial by that time was
the criminal proceedings instigated by the plaintiff, or by Mr Doyle,
against
the second defendant, which were not disposed of until the end of March of the
following year.
<P>

20   	I do not regard the pendency of those criminal proceedings
as constituting any sufficient explanation for the conduct of the
plaintiff in
not setting the matter down for trial by, at the latest, September 1994. But
even if there were, contrary to that view,
sufficient excuse for the plaintiff
not setting the matter down for trial until the disposition of the criminal
proceedings against
Mr Thompson, there is no explanation whatsoever as to why
the plaintiff did not take any step to set the proceedings down for trial
for a
period of more than four years after the disposal of the criminal
proceedings.
<P>

21   	The plaintiff was requested in correspondence from the
solicitors for the defendants, by letter dated 25 October 1995 ---
that is more
than six months after the disposition of the criminal proceedings --- to set
the matter down for trial.  They were asked
when they proposed to do so.  They
were asked to provide that information as a matter of urgency, and a mere
holding response was
sent by them. More than four years elapsed before the
plaintiff chose to set the matter down for trial, on 14 April 1999.
<P>

22   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
inordinate and inexcusable delay (which I do not consider has in
any way been
adequately explained by the evidence) also constitutes an abuse of the process
of the Court.  It may well be that when
a party chooses to delay the matter
without any reason for such a period that such conduct does constitute abuse of
the process of
the Court.  However, in the light of the ultimate conclusions
which I have reached upon the present application, it is not necessary
for me
to express any final view as to whether or not the conduct of the plaintiff in
the instant case does constitute such an abuse
of the process of the Court.
<P>

23   	It will be appreciated that this inordinate and
inexcusable delay of itself merely attracts the discretion of the Court to
dismiss the proceedings.  It does not make such dismissal inevitable.  Part 33
rule 6(2) provides:
<P>

Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or direction as to
the conduct of the proceedings, or does not prosecute
the proceedings with due
despatch, the Court may, on application by any party or of its own motion, stay
or dismiss the proceedings.
<P>

24   	I am under no doubt that the conduct of the plaintiff
constitutes conduct falling within the description that the plaintiff
"does not
prosecute the proceedings with due dispatch".  Accordingly, it becomes
necessary for the Court to consider whether the
discretion to dismiss the
proceedings should be exercised in the instant case.  I have been taken to
various authorities concerning
the way in which Courts on various occasions
have exercised that discretion.  Each case must be decided upon its own facts
and its
own merits.  The Court must do justice between the parties.
<P>

25   	The plaintiffs have submitted that if the proceedings are
dismissed at this stage there will be prejudice to the plaintiff
as a result of
the expiry of a relevant limitation period in relation to various cheques which
are the subject of the substantive
proceedings.  The value of those cheques
totals $29,000. In consequence, even if the plaintiff achieved reinstatement
and were to
institute fresh proceedings, it would be defeated, as a result of
the expiry of the relevant limitation period, in respect to its
claim for
reimbursement relating to cheques of the plaintiff allegedly used for personal
purposes of the second defendant.
<P>

26   	The defendants point to the prejudice caused to them by
the delay.  They refer to evidentiary problems which must inevitably
follow
from delay where the plaintiff has done nothing to advance the progress of the
litigation for a period of more than five years.
Those evidentiary problems
relate to the obtaining of bank records and to attempts to locate former
customers of the plaintiff whose
evidence would be material in resisting the
claim of the plaintiff concerning the breach of fiduciary duty asserted against
the second
defendant in setting up the first defendant in competition with the
plaintiff.
<P>

27   	I have reached the conclusion that, on account of the
inexcusable and inordinate delay, it is proper in this case that the
proceedings should be dismissed, and I propose so to order.  
<P>

28   	I will, however, for completeness make reference to the
third ground upon which the defendants have brought the present application:
that no cause of action is disclosed.
<P>

29   	The defendants refer in particular to the allegation in
the statement of claim in relation to the setting up of the first
defendant in
competition to the plaintiff in the early part of July 1993, and to the fact
that the evidence of Mr Doyle himself disclosed
that the plaintiff ceased
trading on 31 July 1993.  It is not for the Court on an application for summary
dismissal to decide the
merits of the case.  If the Court in the present
application were dealing with the application summary dismissal only upon the
ground
that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, it seems to me that it
could not be said that the claim of the plaintiff was hopeless
or that it was
inevitable that the plaintiff's claim would be unsuccessful, with the
consequence that the plaintiff should be deprived
of the opportunity of having
its claim heard by the appropriate tribunal at a full trial of the
proceedings.
<P>

30   	Accordingly, I would not propose, upon the third of the
grounds relied upon by the applicant defendants, to dismiss the proceedings
in
a summary fashion.  
<P>

31   	Having expressed, however, my view that the proceedings
should be dismissed for want to prosecution on the part of the plaintiff,
it
then becomes necessary for me to return to a consideration of the adjournment
application which was made by the plaintiff on the
ground of the pending
application by the plaintiff for its reinstatement.  
<P>

32   	Since I have arrived at the conclusion that the
proceedings should be dismissed for want of prosecution and since the evidence
discloses that the only purpose for which the plaintiff, or Mr Doyle, is
seeking a reinstatement of the plaintiff is to enable it
to pursue the present
proceedings, it seems to me, that there is no purpose to be served in
adjourning the defendants' notice of
motion, to enable the hearing of the claim
for the reinstatement of the plaintiff, in circumstances where the present
proceedings
should be dismissed on the ground of want of prosecution on the
part of the plaintiff.  
<P>

33   	Therefore, I formally now refuse the application for
adjournment which was made by the plaintiff at the outset of the hearing
of
today's application.  
<P>

34   	I summarise as follows my foregoing conclusions. The
proceedings must be dismissed, firstly, because the plaintiff does not
exist
and has no standing to maintain the proceedings.  Even if the plaintiff were in
existence, the proceedings would be dismissed
because the plaintiff has not
prosecuted them with due dispatch and has been, in my conclusion, guilty of
inordinate and inexcusable
delay.  
<P>

35   	The defendants are seeking an order that Mr Doyle pay the
costs on the party and party basis up to and including 10 May 1999
and that
thereafter he pay the costs on the indemnity basis.
<P>

36   	(Mr Dalgleish objected to an indemnity costs order.)
<P>

37   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1)	I order that the proceedings be and hereby are dismissed.
<P>

2)	I make orders as in paragraphs 3 and 4 in the notice of motion filed by the
defendants on 4 June 1999.
<P>

3)	I order that the costs of the aforesaid notice of motion be included in the
costs referred to in paragraph 4 in the said notice
of motion.
