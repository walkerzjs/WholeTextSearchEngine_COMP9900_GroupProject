<b>20334/98   -   ALEXANDER PRESTON  v  </b>
<P>

<b>STAR CITY PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Strike out statement of claim)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b> By notice of motion filed 15 December 1998 the
defendant seeks to have the statement of claim struck out or alternatively that
paras
(5), (6), (8) and (9) of the statement of claim be struck out pursuant to
Part 15 r 26 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  The argument is essentially a
legal one.
<P>

2  	By statement of claim filed 8 September 1998 the plaintiff
alleges that he was a patron of the casinos operated by the defendant
trading
as Sydney Harbour Casino and Star City Casino between about November 1996 to
approximately March 1998.  
<P>

3  	Between January 1997 and approximately March 1998 the plaintiff
alleges that the defendant breached its statutory duties and
was negligent by
inducing the plaintiff to gamble in its casino particularly when he was
intoxicated.   The particulars given for
the breaches of duty of care and/or
negligence and offering of inducements are similar.  The inducements are
alleged to be informing
the plaintiff that if he remained a "high roller"
patron of the casino the defendant would make available to the plaintiff or his
nominees business contracts for the benefit of the plaintiff in the form of a
contract for designs of merchandise bearing the logo
of Star City and other
designs;  a contract for the purchase of works of art for Star City premises;
a contract for supply of a painting;
 a Christmas gift package for all VIP
members (approximately 12,000 to 15,000);  appointment as a licensee to
manufacture and sell
products bearing the logo of Star City;  supplying
complimentary products, services and privileges to the plaintiff and supplying
a cheque cashing facility for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff claims that he
suffered gambling losses of in excess of $3,000,000 (although
this amount does
not appear in the statement of claim it has been particularised), depression
and anxiety.  In addition, he claims
aggravated and exemplary damages and
interest.  No defence has been filed.
<P>

4  	Part 15 r 26 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where a pleading -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the pleading;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings, or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the
whole or any part of the pleadings be struck out.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an
order under subrule (1)."</b>
<P>

5  	In <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for
Railways</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> Barwick CJ, who heard the application
alone, at p 29 stated: 
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

6  	Barwick CJ referred to Dixon J's passage quoted at p 130.
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  `be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense."</b>
<P>

7  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to
remind himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway
Commissioners</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%2d49%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948-49) 78 CLR 62</a>, <b><u>General Steel</u></b> and

<P>

8  	Master Allen (as he then was) in <b><u>Contribution Fund of
Australia v Hunt</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2044%20ALR%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 44 ALR 365</a> at pp 373-374  said:
<P>

<b>"...It is not by any means rare in the history of the development of the
common law that a high appellate court, in enunciating a
novel development in
the law, albeit one avowedly based on a miscellany of old cases, has chosen to
use general words of imprecise
limits in meaning to facilitate the arrival, in
later cases, of the final form of the development without the need to overrule
what
earlier had been stated.  That being so I am of opinion that a court at
first instance should be particularly astute not to risk
stifling that
development of the law by summarily throwing out of court actions in respect of
which there is a reasonable possibility
that it will be found, in the
development of the law, still embryonic, that a cause of action does lie.  The
risk of injustice to
the plaintiff, which summary termination of his claim
would entail, is real.  One cannot predict, with firm assurance, what the
future
holds as the final formulation of the new development."</b>
<P>

9  	This passage was quoted with approval by Justice Badgery-Parker
in <b><u>Gibson v Parkes District Hospital</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d92%29%2026%20NSWLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-92) 26 NSWLR 9</a> at p
35.
<P>

10  	The defendant submitted that the plaintiff's claim for breaches
of statutory duty should be struck out.  According to the defendant,
the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1992166/" class="autolink_findacts">Casino Control Act</a></b> 1992 (NSW) (the Act) operates to make lawful the
conduct of gaming in a casino.  This is done on the basis that there is only
one
casino, the <b>Casino Control</b> <b>Authority</b> (the Authority) is paid
casino duty, and a casino benefit levy, and extensive and minute controls are
imposed on all aspects of the
casino.  The objects of the Authority are set out
in s 140 of the Act (to which I will refer later in this judgment) and the
functions
of the Authority are set out in s 141 of the Act.  Section 141 (4)
specifically states that the Authority in the exercise of its
functions is not
required to observe the rules of natural justice (except to the extent that it
is specifically required to do so
by the Act).  However, the <b>Authority</b>
has wider obligations to report to Parliament that do most statutory
authorities - see s 154.  
<P>

11  	According to the defendant the Act is unique.  The extent to
which the courts have power to intervene in the operations of
the casino has
been referred to in the Act.  The court can grant an injunction, at the suit of
the Authority, concerning contraventions
of the Act, or contraventions of a
condition of the licence.  There is no specific power for an individual to seek
damages.  According
to the defendant, the powers of the Authority are so
extensive, and the nature of the legal obligations that are imposed on the
casino
operator are so closely defined that the statute cannot be constructed
as intending to give a private right of action for damages
in addition to any
obligation which are expressly imposed on the operator.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff has specifically pleaded two breaches of statutory
duty namely breaches of ss 70 and 163 of the Act.
<P>

13  	In relation to the law as to whether a breach of the statutory
duty gives rise to a private right the parties referred me to
<b><u>Sovar v
Henry Lane Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%2d67%29%20116%20CLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966-67) 116 CLR 397</a> and <b><u>Stubbs v NRMA
Insurance Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 550.</a>  In <b><u>Sovar</u></b> Kitto J at p
405 stated:
<P>

<b>"...The intention that such a private right shall exist is not ... conjured
up by judges to give effect to their own ideas of policy
and then `imputed' to
the legislature.  The legitimate endeavour of the courts is to determine what
inference really arises, on a
balance of considerations, from the nature, which
it is directed, the nature of the conduct prescribed, the pre-existing state of
the law, and, generally, the whole range of circumstances relevant upon a
question of statutory interpretation."</b>
<P>

14  	The above quote was cited with approval in <b><u>Stubbs</u></b>
at p 555.
<P>

15  	The plaintiff submitted that in ascertaining whether the
breaches of statutory duties confer private rights is to be considered
in the
light of policy decisions made in relation to the Act.  The plaintiff's counsel
referred me to portions of the report entitled
"<b>Inquiry into the
Establishment and Operation of Legal Casinos in New South Wales" </b>by<b> The
Honourable Sir Laurence Street AC KCMG</b> dated 27 November 1991 (the report)
and the second reading speech in relation to the <b>Casino Control Bill</b> in
the Legislative Assembly on 5 March 1992 (the second reading speech).  At para
4.4.23 of the report, Sir Laurence Street referred
to the impact of problem
gambling on individuals and families.  There was evidence made available to him
which revealed that the
impact of problem gambling on individuals and families
is significant.  Numerous submissions from churches and other institutions
and
individuals also expressed strong views regarding the consequences of
introducing casinos.  Some were opposed to casinos on moral
grounds alone.
Many were concerned about the social harm caused by gambling in the community.
Sir Laurence Street, after having discussions
with counsellors, Gamblers
Anonymous and Gam-Anon members, and obtaining evidence from other experts and
from the academic literature
took heed of these expressions of concern.  Sir
Laurence Street referred to and was satisfied that for the problem gambler, for
his
or her family and close associates and for society at large, there are
serious human costs.  
<P>

16  	At p 69 at paras 4.6.12 and 4.6.13 Sir Laurence Street refers to
junkets and other inducements.  At para 4.6.13 he says that
many casinos
provide inducements to gamblers to attract them to casinos or, keep them there
or once there to keep them gambling.
 These include free transportation, free
meals, drinks and accommodation.  Concerns had been raised that these
inducements play on
a problems gambler's delusions of grandeur and assist in
the loss of control.  Gamblers Anonymous members confirmed that casinos
would
go to great lengths to hold onto a "good loser".  Sir Laurence Street suggested
that these were strong reasons for developing
guidelines in regard to the
provision of inducements generally and he recommended that the Authority give
consideration to this.
<P>

17  	At para 4.7 Sir Laurence Street commented upon the statutory
objects of the Authority.  He said that the draft Bill conferred
extensive
powers on the Authority.  He commented that there was no express reference to
what may be called the humanitarian aspects
of operating casinos.  He suggested
that the objects of the Authority be extended to include ensuring that the
consumer protection
initiatives be introduced, and that all reasonable steps
should be taken to contain and control the potential of casinos to cause
harm
to the public interest and to individuals and families.  It can be argued that
as a result of Sir Laurence Street's recommendation,
s 140(d) was included in
the Act.
<P>

18  	At p 516 of the <b>Hansard Report</b> Mrs Cohen who was the then
Chief Secretary and Minister for Administrative Services (Chief Secretary)
referred to benefits to the
community that the casino would bring.  She
referred to employment opportunities both through the construction and
operation of casinos
and she said that one could see that the casino would be
of value to New South Wales.  However, she recorded that the government
had
been concerned about the social impact of the legal casino gambling and the
very fact that it established the public inquiry
was testimony to this.  She
acknowledged that gambling related problems exist in our community and that is
the unfortunate reality.
 
<P>

19  	The Chief Secretary referred to Sir Laurence Street's
recommendation that the draft legislation be amended to widen the objects
of
the proposed Authority to ensure that all reasonable steps be taken to contain
and control the potential of casinos to cause harm
to the publics' interests
and to individuals and families.  She predicted that whilst it was impossible
to estimate the exact numbers
that would be affected the introduction of legal
casinos would increase the number of problem gamblers and increase the demand
for
social and related services.  The Chief Secretary suggested that this was a
logical conclusion for Sir Laurence to draw and that
the government did not shy
away from that reality and was prepared to tackle the problems.  She listed the
steps to be taken including
the introduction of guidelines to cover inducements
provided by casino to gamblers.  The plaintiff also referred to an article
written
by Robert Solomon and John Payne entitled "<b>Alcohol Liability in
Canada and Australia:  Sell, Serve and be Sued"</b> which was published in
<b>Tort Law Review</b> November 1996 at p 188.
<P>

20  	Firstly I turn to consider s 163 of the Act.  The relevant parts
of that section state:
<P>

<b>"163	Conduct in casino</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A casino operator must not:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	permit intoxication within the gaming area of the casino , or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	permit any indecent, violent or quarrelsome conduct within the gaming
area of the casino , or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	permit an intoxicated person to gamble in the casino.</b>
<P>

<b>Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A member of the staff of a casino must not:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	sell or supply liquor to an intoxicated person who is in the gaming area
of the casino, or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	permit an intoxicated person to gamble in the casino .</b>
<P>

<b>Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	If a person within the gaming area of a casino is intoxicated, the
casino operator is taken to have permitted intoxication within
the gaming area
unless it is proved that the casino operator took all reasonable steps to
prevent intoxication  within the gaming
area."</b>
<P>

21  	As previously stated s 140 sets out the objects of the
Authority.  One of the objects of the Authority is to obtain and administer
systems for the licensing, supervision and control of the a casino.  Subsection
140(d) places an obligation on the Authority to contain
and control the
potential of a casino to cause harm to the public interest and to individuals
and families.  Regulation 20 provides:
<P>

<b>"20	Certain inducements prohibited</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A casino operator, a casino employee or an agent of the casino operator
must not provide a casino patron with liquor free of charge
(or at a
substantial discount) unless the liquor is provided in accordance with any
direction that the Authority may from time to
time give to the casino operator
for the purposes of this clause.</b>
<P>

<b>Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Subclause (1) does not apply in respect of liquor provided to a casino
patron in:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	an area of the casino designated (in the plans, diagrams and
specifications for the time being approved by the Authority under
section 65 of
the Act) as other than the general casino area, or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	a part of the general casino area that is for the time being reserved
(as indicated by means of ropes and signs) for the use of
certain casino
patrons only."</b>
<P>

22  	The statement of claim as currently pleaded does not allege a
breach of Regulation 20.
<P>

23  	The defendant submitted that even if it were to be accepted that
the purpose of s 163 included protecting the intoxicated person
from financial
loss, it does not follow that a private right of action is to be implied.  The
defendant suggested that the circumstances
where the courts have recognised an
implied right to bring an action for damages for breach of statutory duty have
mainly been in
the area of regulation of standards of work where employees
suffer physical injury.  According to the defendant where a casino is
open to
the public there are no particular class of persons who are sought to be
protected by s 163.  This is a requirement for the
existence of an action for
breach of statutory duty.  On the other hand the plaintiff submitted that
proper construction of s 163
is not directed only at patrons of the casino but
is plainly intended to be for the benefit and protection of a particular class
of persons namely those who gamble or continue to gamble while intoxicated.

<P>

24  	The defendant asserted that an analogous provision to s 163 is s
125(3) of the <b>Liquor Act</b> 1982 (NSW) which states "a person (whether or
not he or she is a licensee) shall not, on licensed premises, sell or supply
liquor
to any person who is at the time, in a state of intoxication."  Section
125(3) is similar to s 46 of the <b>Liquor Act</b> 1912 (NSW) which provided
"If any licensee permits drunkenness ... to take place in his licensed premises
he should be liable ...
to a penalty."  
<P>

25  	The defendant referred to the authorities of <b><u>Chordas v
Bryant (Wellington) Pty Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/462.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 462</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2020%20FCR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 20 FCR 91</a> at 102 and
<b><u>Soutter v P &amp; O Resorts Pty Limited &amp; Anor</u></b> (unreported,
Court of Appeal, Queensland 13 March 1998).  In <b><u>Chordas</u></b> the full
Federal Court considered whether s 79 of the <b>Liquor Ordinance</b> conferred
a private right of action for damages.  The Federal Court of Appeal referred to
<b><u>Sovar</u></b> and then said that s 79 appeared in an ordinance which was
intended to protect the public interest by regulating the sale of intoxicating
liquor, so as to protect those who by over indulgence or because of youth or
mental ill-health are at risk from its abuse.  The court
referred to
<b><u>Abela v Giew</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%2065%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 65 SR (NSW) 185</a> where it was held that a
breach of like regulations, those made under the <b>Motor Traffic Act</b> 1909
(NSW), did not confer any private right of action upon persons injured by
reason of a breach thereof.  The court concluded that
for similar reasons s 79
did not confer a private right of action for damages resulting from its breach.
Section 79 was enacted in
the general public interest not for the protection
for persons who may be injured by the conduct of intoxicated persons.  
<P>

26  	In <b><u>Soutter</u></b> the court interpreted s 78 of the
<b>Liquor Act 1912 (Queensland)</b>.  The appellant was struck while standing
on a dance floor by an energetic dancer.  It held that in the present case it
may well
have been reasonable to treat the statute as intended to protect a
particular class of persons, namely the respectable patrons of
the licensed
premises, from harm or annoyance as may be caused by the presence of
disreputable characters, thieves drunkards and
so forth.  But the court held
that it appeared a difficult step to go further to say that one should impute
to the legislature an
intention to grant a civil cause of action.  One of the
reasons for the reluctance to do so was that the categories of people who
are
to be kept off the premises are rather broadly indicated and that it was hardly
to be expected a licensee would be able to discern
without considerable
investigation whether any of the customers on the premises from time to time
might fall within one of the categories
and it held that the provision in
question did not rise to a civil action for its breach.  
<P>

27  	The plaintiff alleges that he became intoxicated to such an
extent that he was physically sick in the toilets and fell over
in the VIP
room.  It is my view that it is arguable that the liquor cases can be
distinguished in that the liquor legislation is
concerned with the consumption
of alcohol not problems that can be caused when the consumption of alcohol is
combined with gambling
in a casino.  It can also be argued that s 163 is
directed to a particular class of persons namely those gamblers who are
intoxicated
and not the public at large.  The difficulties experienced by an
intoxicated gambler have been referred to in policy documents and
the second
reading speech relating to the Act.  
<P>

28  	As to whether a breach of s 163 gives rise to a private right,
it is necessary to consider s 163 in the light of the other
provisions of the
Act including s 143(d) which specifically refers to one of the objects of the
Authority as being to contain and
control the potential of the casino to cause
harm to the public interest and to individuals and families.  Section 163 (and
s 70)
of the Act may be considered in the light of the policy considerations
such as the second reading speech and the report that gave
rise to those
provisions (see s 34 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</a> </b>1987 (NSW)). Also, an
intention to create a private right may arise on a balance of considerations
and a whole range of circumstances.
 Without those facts and circumstances and
the conduct of the parties being known, I cannot conclude that the plaintiff's
argument
in relation to s 163 action is untenable.  Further, the obligation and
responsibilities that casino operators and the Authority to
have towards
patrons particularly in circumstances where the patrons become intoxicated and
continue to gamble have not been the
subject of judicial determination.  For
these reasons, the argument that a breach of s 163 may give rise to a private
right should
be permitted to go to trial
<P>

29  	I turn now to s 70 of the Act which provides:
<P>

<b>"70	Conduct of gaming</b>
<P>

<b>  (1)	It is a condition of a casino licence that the following provisions
are complied with in the casino and the casino operator
is to be considered to
have contravened that condition if they are not complied with:</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	a person who is at or in the vicinity of the casino and is an agent of
the casino operator or a casino employee must not induce
patrons to enter the
casino or take part in gaming in the casino..."</b>
<P>

30  	Section 70 creates an obligation on the holders of the casino
licence not to induce patrons to take part in gambling at the
casino and
failure to do so will be considered a contravention of a condition of the
licence.  It does not seem that this section
is intended to apply to persons
who attend the casino and are subject to inducements but rather it is intended
to establish whether
a casino operator has complied with the conditions of its
licence and if it hasn't it is liable to a penalty.  Section 70 may be
considered with regulation 20.  While the plaintiff's case in relation to s 70
is weak, I cannot conclude that it is untenable or
hopeless.  For the reasons
given in para (28) of my judgment, it is my view that the plaintiff's claim in
respect of s 70 of the
Act should not be struck out and it should be allowed to
proceed to trial.
<P>

31  	The defendants submitted that the claim in negligence is for
pure economic loss and there is no recognised category of case
which
establishes that a duty of care exists and on this basis the statement of claim
should be struck out.  According to the defendant,
because the loss is pure
economic loss, the fact that it is foreseeable that someone who gambles money
at a casino might lose money
is insufficient to impose a duty of care.
According to the defendant, there has to be something more than the
foreseeability of loss
from the plaintiff being a patron at the casino to
establish a duty of care.  It could be argued by the plaintiff that he claims
not only economic loss in the sense referred to by the defendant but by reason
of his psychiatric condition has suffered loss of
commissions or wages.  If
that be the case, it has not been pleaded properly.  The plaintiff is not just
claiming purely economic
loss but also alleges that his anxiety and depression
was caused by the defendant's alleged negligence.
<P>

32  	In relation to a claim for economic loss caused by negligence
the High Court in  <b><u>Bryan v Maloney</u></b> (1995) 182 CLR 609, (Mason CJ,
Dean and Gauldron JJ) at p 618 held: 
<P>

<b>"...the field of liability for mere economic loss is a comparatively new and
developing area of the law of negligence.  In that area,
the question whether
the requisite relationship of proximity exists in a particular category of case
is more likely to be unresolved
by previous binding Authority with the
consequence that the "notion of proximity ... is of vital importance".  As
Stephen J indicated
in <i>Caltex Oil (Australia Pty Ltd v The Dredge
"Willemstad"</i>, it is the "articulation", in the different categories of
case, "of circumstances which denote sufficient proximity" with respect
to mere
economic loss, including "policy considerations", which will gradually provide
"a body of precedent productive of the necessary
certainty".  Inevitably, the
policy considerations which are legitimately taken into account in determining
whether sufficient proximity
exists in a novel category will be influenced by
the courts' assessment of community standards and demands.</b>
<P>

<b>One policy consideration which may militate against recognition of a
relationship of proximity in a category of case involving mere
economic loss is
the law's concern to avoid the imposition of liability "in an indeterminate
amount for an indeterminate time to
an indeterminate class".  Another
consideration is the perception that, in a competitive world where one person's
economic gain is
commonly another's loss, a duty to take reasonable care to
avoid causing mere economic loss to another's person or property, may
be
inconsistent with community standards in relation to what is ordinarily
legitimate in the pursuit of personal advantage.  The
combined effect of those
two distinct policy considerations is that the categories of case in which the
requisite relationship of
proximity with respect to mere economic loss is to be
found are properly to be seen as special.  Commonly, but not necessarily, they
will involve an identified element of known reliance (or dependence) or the
assumption of responsibility or a combination of the
two."</b>
<P>

33  	In <b><u>Hill v Van Erp</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%20188%20CLR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 188 CLR 159</a>, the High
Court considered the concept of proximity where the loss was an economic one.
The concept of proximity as an identifier
of a duty of care at common law has
been subject to recent judicial criticism - see Kirby J in <b><u>Pyrenees Shire
Council v Day</u></b> (1998) 192 CLR 431.
<P>

34  	In relation to whether it can be argued that there is proximity
between the parties, this enquiry is directed to the relationship
between the
parties.  It involves the notion of nearness or closeness, and embraces
physical proximity (in  the sense of space and
time) between the person or
property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant,
circumstantial proximity and causal
proximity.  The plaintiff submitted that on
the facts pleaded in this case the requirement of proximity in the relationship
between
the plaintiff and the defendant is satisfied.  According to the
plaintiff, at the times when the tort is alleged to have occurred
there was
undoubtedly physical proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant, its
servants or agents.  The plaintiff was gambling
in premises under the exclusive
care, control and management of the defendant.  The defendant through its
servants or agents is alleged
to have induced the plaintiff by speaking to him,
physically supplying him with complimentary products, services and privileges
and
providing a cheque cashing facility and alcohol at the premises in
question.  
<P>

35  	According to the plaintiff circumstantial proximity is also
present on the facts pleaded in the statement of claim.  At the
relevant time
there was a relationship between the casino as provider of gambling facilities,
services and alcohol on the one hand
and the plaintiff as a consumer of such
facilities, services and alcohol on the other.  The plaintiff submitted that
there are causal
connections between the acts of the defendant complained of in
the statement of claim (namely inducing the plaintiff to gamble and
allowing
him to gamble whilst intoxicated from alcohol provided by the defendant to him
on its premises) on the one hand and the
injuries and economic loss which he
suffered in consequence of such acts on the other.
<P>

36  	The plaintiff also submitted that another factor in favour of
the existence of the necessary proximity on the facts pleaded
is the
circumstance that the class of persons (of which the plaintiff is one) to whom
the duty is owed by the operator of the casino
is readily ascertainable;  it
consists of all patrons who are permitted entry to the casino in question.
According to the plaintiff
even if this were a case of pure economic loss the
fact that the defendant through its servants or agents, as the controller and
manager of the casino had the knowledge or means of knowledge that the
plaintiff as a particular person, not merely as a member of
an unascertained
class, would be likely to suffer economic loss as a consequence of the casino's
negligence, would be a factor in
favour of the recovery of damages for pure
economic loss.
<P>

37  	I accept that from the plaintiff's submissions referred to
above, it is arguable and that there is a relationship of proximity
that can be
seen as special as between the casino licence operator and the gambler who is
offered with inducements in excess of that
which can be expected in the
commercial world and allows or encourages a gambler to continue to gamble while
he is intoxicated.
<P>

38  	The defendant also submitted that there is no arguable duty of
care and no breach concerning the offering of inducements. 
According to the
defendant the offering of inducements is an ordinary part of commercial
activity and there is no duty of care on
a casino operator to refrain from
inducing people to come to the premises to gamble there.  This in my view does
not take into account
the duty of care a casino operator may owe to a person
who is intoxicated and induced to gamble.  Regulation 20 prohibits certain
inducements and specifically refers to the provision of liquor free of charge.
The defendant may owe a greater duty of care where
the patron is heavily
intoxicated, his reasoning is impaired and he does not appreciate the
consequences of offering inducements
where the defendant knows the plaintiff is
heavily intoxicated maybe considered to go beyond ordinary commercial
activity.
<P>

39  	It can also be argued that the risk of a psychiatric injury and
economic loss to a patron of the defendant's casino as a result
of a failure to
take reasonable care by the casino operator was reasonably foreseeable by a
reasonable person in the position of
the defendant.  It can also be argued that
the risk of injury was not far fetched or fanciful.  
<P>

40  	It is my view that the plaintiff's claim in negligence cannot be
said to be hopeless or untenable and it should be permitted
to proceed to
trial.
<P>

41  	Finally the defendant submitted that para (8)(c) of the
statement of claim which refers to the inducement of supplying a cheque
cashing
facility for the plaintiff, should be struck out because s 75 permits such a
facility.  Section 75 does permit a cheque cashing
facility but it is argued
that this facility although permitted, is one of the factors that formed part
of the inducement.  It should
be allowed to go to trial.
<P>

42  	In the light of Brennan J's comment in <b><u>Maloney</u></b>
that liability for mere economic loss is a comparatively new and developing
area of the law in negligence and Master Allen's (as
he then was) comments in
<b><u>Contribution Fund of Australia</u></b>, I take into account the court
should be particularly astute not to risk stifling the development of the law
and this is a further
reason why the claim should be permitted to go to
trial.
<P>

43  	I turn now to the defendant's submission in relation to the
inadequacy of the pleading. The onus is on the plaintiff in the
statement of
claim to set out the facts upon which the defendants can become aware of the
precise allegations made against them and
hence what is it that they have to
meet.  If a fact is material, it must be pleaded and not merely referred to in
particulars - see
<b><u>H 1976 Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli Ltd &amp; Quarries
Ltd</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1979/74.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] FCA 74</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2030%20ALR%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 30 ALR 181</a> at 186 and 187.
<P>

44  	In relation to the pleading of negligence, the defendant
submitted that the pleading of duty of care in para (10) of the statement
of
claim was inadequate.  The defendant also submitted that para (13) as currently
pleaded is inadequate because no factual basis
has been pleaded for the award
of aggravated damages and these damages are generally not available in
negligence.  Also the defendant
submitted that facts which found the claim for
exemplary damages (also in para (13) of the statement of claim) should be
pleaded.
 In relation to interest the defendant says that the plaintiff's claim
for interest on the whole of the awards from 1 January 1997
to date of judgment
is not supported by any facts and should be struck out.
<P>

45  	In relation to whether the duty of care is sufficient,
paragraphs (1) to (4) of the statement of claim pleads that the defendant
carries on business as the operator of a casino licence and in 1996 and 1997
operated premises trading as Sydney Harbour Casino and
as from about November
1997 it operated from Pyrmont trading as Star City.  Paragraph (7) pleads that
the plaintiff was a patron
of both the Harbour Casino and the Star City Casino.
It is clear that the alleged duty of care that is pleaded is one arising
between
the operator of a casino licence and a patron.  Whether such a duty of
care exists is a matter for legal argument.  Paragraph (10)
is properly
pleaded.
<P>

46  	I turn to the difference between aggravated and exemplary
damages which was discussed in <b><u>Uren v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty
Ltd</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20117%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 117 CLR 118</a> at 149 Windeyer J said:
<P>

<b>"aggravated damages are given to compensate the plaintiff when the harm done
to him by a wrongful act was aggravated by the manner
in which the act was
done:  exemplary damages, on the other hand, are intended to punish the
defendant, and presumably to serve one
or more of the objects of punishment -
moral retribution or deterrence."</b>
<P>

47  	In relation to aggravated damages, the defendant referred to a
passage in <b>Halsbury's Laws of Australia</b> ((1999) edition Reed
International Books trading as Butterworths at para 135-595).  This passage
states that aggravated damages are
recoverable in trespass, defamation,
conspiracy, malicious prosecution and inducing breach of contract.  It does not
refer to breach
of statutory duty but in a recent Court of Appeal decision
<b><u>Collings Constructions Co Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v ACCC</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20131" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43
NSWLR 131</a> (referred to later in this judgment) it was held that aggravated
damages can be awarded for breach of statutory duty.  However Halsbury
states
that the absence of any element of damage at large will generally exclude an
award of aggravated damages in negligence. 
<P>

48  	The passage cites <b><u>Kralje &amp; Anor v McGrath &amp;
Anor</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20All%20ER%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 All ER 54</a> as authority for this proposition.
<b><u>Kralje</u></b> concerned an obstetrician who negligently delivered the
plaintiff's baby who was a twin.  The baby Daniel died as a result of injuries
9 weeks after birth.  At p 61 Woolf J (as he then was) held that it would be
wholly inappropriate to introduce into claims for breach
of contract and
negligence the concept of aggravated damages.  His Honour's reasoning was as
follows.  If aggravated damages were
to apply in this situation of a doctor not
treating a patient in accordance with his duty, whether under contract or in
tort, then
he would consider that it must apply in other situations where a
person is under a duty to exercise care.  It would be difficult
to see why it
could not even extend to cases where damages are brought for personal injuries
in respect of driving.  If the principle
is right, a higher award of damages
would be appropriate in a case of reckless driving which caused injury than
would be appropriate
in cases where careless driving caused identical injuries.
Such a result seemed to him to be wholly inconsistent with the general
approach
to damages in this area, which is to compensate the plaintiff for the loss that
she had actually suffered, so far as it
is possible to do so, by the award of
monetary compensation and not to treat those damages as being a matter which
reflects the degree
of negligence or breach of duty of the defendant.  Thus it
would appear that aggravated damages are not available in claim for
negligence.
<P>

49  	In order for the defendant to meet the plaintiff's claim for
exemplary damages the matters which found this claim should be
pleaded.  The
claim for exemplary damages as currently pleaded cannot be sustained and should
be struck out.  However it is my view
that the plaintiff should be afforded a
further opportunity to replead these claims for damages provided he included
the alleged
factual bases for the alleged entitlement.
<P>

50  	Aggravated damages can be awarded for breach of statutory duty
but as previously stated it depends on the wording of the statute
as to whether
a breach will found an action and whether the remedy is available.  If the
statute does supply a remedy, the presumption
is to use the remedy supplied
(<b>Halsbury's Law of Australia</b> (1996) (Butterworths Vol 124 at para
385-580).
<P>

51  	In <b><u>Collings</u></b>, the Court of Appeal awarded
aggravated damages for breach of statutory duty because s 87 of the <b>Trade
Practices Act</b> 1974 (Cth) should not be narrowly interpreted as a measure of
damages in tort or contract, but provided for compensatory damages
and
aggravated damages are compensatory in nature (see Cole JA with whom Stein JA
and Sheppard AJA agreed at p 156G).  The nature
of s 87 of the <b>Trade
Practices Act</b> is very different from that of ss 70 and 163 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1992166/" class="autolink_findacts">Casino
Control Act</a></b>.  
<P>

52  	As the claim for aggravated damages is currently pleaded, it is
difficult to see how this claim can be sustained and it should
be struck out.
Perhaps the plaintiff is alleging that the actions of the defendant in allowing
the plaintiff to continue to gamble
while intoxicated and suffer further losses
aggravated his psychiatric condition.  If this is the case, it should be
pleaded.
<P>

53  	Lastly, in relation to interest it is claimed from 1 January
1997 which dates from about the time that the plaintiff first
attended the
casino.  The defendant does not know whether the interest is claiming for
gambling losses or some other loss eg., past
loss of wages or commissions due
to the plaintiff's alleged psychiatric condition, nor does it know at what
rates interest is claimed,
whether it is at Supreme Court rates in accordance
with Schedule J or market rates.  It is my view the claim in relation to
interest
as currently pleaded should be struck out.  The plaintiff should be
given a further opportunity properly plead its claim in relation
to
interest.
<P>

54  	It is also my view that the plaintiff should properly plead the
amount of the gambling loss and how this amount is calculated.
 Accordingly,
paragraphs (12)(a), (13) and (14)(b) of the statement of claim filed 8
September 1998 should be struck out.  The plaintiff
should be given a further
opportunity to properly replead these paragraphs in an amended statement of
claim.
<P>

55  	The defendant was unsuccessful in relation to its attempt to
have the plaintiff's claim for breaches of statutory duty and
negligence struck
out.  It was legal argument directed to the strike out that took most of the
court's time.  However, the defendant
has had a small measure of success as the
plaintiff has been ordered to replead certain paragraphs of the statement of
claim.  In
these circumstances it is my view that the appropriate order for
costs is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

56  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The defendant's notice of motion filed 15 December 1998 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	Paragraphs (12)(a), (13) and (14)(b) of the statement of claim are struck
out.  The plaintiff has a further opportunity to replead
his claims in respect
of aggravated and exemplary damages, interest and gambling losses.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff is to file and serve an amended statement of claim within 28
days.
<P>

(4)	Costs of the motion are costs in the cause.
<P>
