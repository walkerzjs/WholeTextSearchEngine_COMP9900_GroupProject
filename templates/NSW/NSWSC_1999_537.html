<b>1619/97	GOSFORD QUARRIES LIMITED &amp; 3 ORS   -v-   ROY LOVELL GOUGH &amp;
4 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> By notice of motion filed 13 April 1999 the
plaintiffs, Gosford Quarries Limited, Gosford Quarries Projects Pty Ltd,
Gosford Quarries
NSW Pty Ltd and Sandstones of Australia Pty Ltd, seek orders
that the various defendants give discovery in relation to the classes
of
documents referred to in the schedules to the notice of motion.
<P>

2   	The hearing before me has been confined to the discovery
which the plaintiffs say should be made by the first and third defendants
and
by the fourth and fifth defendants.  The application for discovery is brought
pursuant to the provisions of Part 23 of the Supreme
Court Rules and, in
particular, rule 3 of that part.
<P>

3   	I have during the course of the submissions by Counsel for
the plaintiffs and by Counsel for the first and third defendants
and the fourth
and fifth defendants, indicated at least my provisional view concerning the
various documents in relation to which
the plaintiffs seek discovery from those
defendants.  In respect to discovery  by the first and third defendants in
accordance with
Schedule 1 annexed to the notice of motion those defendants
agree to discovery with respect to items (v) and (vi).  They oppose discovery
in the terms sought in respect to the other items.
<P>

4   	It is submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
material sought in items (i), (ii) and (iii) is too wide and that it is
material (which except, for example,  in item (i) in relation to timing) which
does not go to matters in issue between the parties
and that the financing of
the purchases referred to in items (ii) and (iii) is not relevant to the issues
between the parties.
<P>

5   	I am satisfied, however, that the entirety of the material
sought in items (i), (ii) and (iii) should be discovered by the
first and
second defendants.
<P>

6   	Again, it is submitted on behalf of those defendants that
item (iv) is too wide.  The plaintiffs agree that the word "written"
should
appear in the final line of that item before the words "service contract".
Subject to the insertion of that word, I am of
the view that the defendants
should make discovery of the material in that item.
<P>

7   	I have already recorded that the defendants are agreeable
to make discovery in respect to items (v) and (vi).
<P>

8   	The defendants submit that whilst the discovery should be
made of the diary or diaries referred to in item (vii), the period
is too wide.
I am in agreement that it is too wide.  It seems to me that the commencing date
for that material should be the date
of tender of the earliest project, being
the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority Project dated 1 January 1991. Although
the defendants
have submitted that the final date should be the end of 1996,
that being the end of the period when competition business appears
to have been
obtained, I, nevertheless, am in agreement with the submission made on behalf
of the plaintiffs in relation not merely
to this item but to various other
items, that the defendants have not put on affidavit evidence addressing
matters in issue with
specificity, but rely essentially upon the express
denials made in their defence.
<P>

9   	In those circumstances therefore I consider that the final
date should be the date of the commencement of the present proceedings,
which
is 7 March 1997.
<P>

10   	Item (viii) as to dates will follow item (vii).  I have
already, during submissions, expressed the view that the plaintiffs
are not
entitled to item (xi).  That item is premature, since it is relevant to relief
in the nature of an account of profits.  It
is necessary at the substantive
hearing for the plaintiffs to establish only that they have suffered loss; it
is not necessary for
them to condescend into details of the calculation of that
loss.  It is in respect to that calculation that item (ix) may ultimately
become relevant.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs are not entitled to item (ix).
<P>

11   	I have already indicated in respect to item (x) that that
item should be limited as to time, being to the commencement of
the proceedings
on 7 March 1997, and also should be limited to the various projects referred to
in the statement of claim.  It has
been submitted on behalf of the defendants
that item (x) should also be limited to the involvement of the second
defendant.  I have
already adverted to the fact that the defendants have not
put on any affidavit evidence which would allow that question of involvement
to
be asserted with a degree of specificity.  In those circumstances, therefore, I
am not disposed to limit item (x) in the way in
which the defendants submit.
It will be limited only as to the projects and as to the date in the manner to
which I have already
referred.
<P>

12   	Item (xi) relates to the cause of action in conversion.  I
am in agreement with the submission of the defendants that the
time period is
far too wide.  It should be limited to commence at a date some time before the
first delivery; that delivery appears
to have occurred in about mid-1992.  The
defendants suggest 1 March 1992.  The plaintiffs, however, point to the fact
that once again
the areas of dispute in this regard are not defined in the
pleadings and that no affidavits have been filed in this regard by the
defendants, and they suggest that a more appropriate date is 1 January 1991.  I
am in agreement with that submission. So the commencement
date in respect to
item (xi) will be 1 January 1991.
<P>

13   	The final date will be 31 December 1993, having regard to
the fact that the last delivery was made on 14 December 1993.
<P>

14   	Item (xii) will follow item (xi) so far as dates are
concerned.  
<P>

15   	Item (xiii) should be subject to a time limit.  It has
been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the commencing time
limit
should be the date of the commencement of negotiations between the plaintiffs
and the third defendant in October 1993.  However,
it would appear that the
first defendant in his affidavit evidence referred to having some prior
knowledge of the tests. In those
circumstances, I consider that it would be
appropriate that the commencing date should be 1 January 1993.
<P>

16   	The final date was submitted on behalf of the defendants
to be the date of completion of the sale of the shares on 19 October
1994. But
it would appear that tests were continuing for about a year after the date of
that sale of shares before appropriate results
were obtained.  Therefore the
final date for item (xiii) should be 31 December 1995.
<P>

17   	As to item (xiv), the defendants submitted that that item
should be limited to the involvement of the second defendant, since
that item
is relevant to the cause of action in unlawful interference.  For the reasons
in relation to item (x), upon which I rejected
a similar submission by the
defendants, I do not consider that item (xiv) should be limited to the
involvement of the second defendant.
<P>

18   	In respect to Schedule 2 and the various items sought by
the plaintiffs to be discovered by the fourth and fifth defendants,
items (i),
(ii) and (iii) will, for the reasons which I expressed in relation to the first
and third defendants, be ordered to be
discovered by the fourth and fifth
defendants.
<P>

19   	Item (iv) should be limited as to time.  The appropriate
time, in my view, should commence on 1 October 1993 and should be
limited to
conclude on 1 December 1994, for the reasons referred to during the course of
submissions.
<P>

20   	Although it was submitted on behalf of the fourth and
fifth defendants in respect to item (v) that the fifth defendant is
in effect a
stranger to the claim in relation to which this item is sought and should,
therefore, not be required to make discovery,
nevertheless it appears that, to
the extent that there is a cause of action asserted against her of having
knowingly participated
in a breach by the first defendant of his fiduciary
duty, the material sought in item (v) in relation to vendors under the purchase
is a matter in which the fifth defendant should, in my view, be required to
make discovery. Accordingly, I propose to order as in
item (v), omitting
therefrom the words "the second defendant and".
<P>

21   	The plaintiffs no longer seek the material in items (vi)
and (vii) of the schedule. 
<P>

22   	I propose to stand this matter over to an appropriate
time, or date, to allow the parties to bring in a written document reflecting
the results which I have just expressed. 
<P>

23   	I stand the matter over to Wednesday 2 June 1999 for the
bringing in of short minutes and for argument as to costs.
<P>
