<b>JUDGMENT (Applications to dismiss actions for want of prosecution)</b>
<P>

<b>Gill v Eatts &amp; Nationwide News Pty Limited (19472/86)</b>
<P>

1   	The applicants seek the dismissal of the plaintiff's action
for want of prosecution.  The plaintiff's action for defamation
was instituted
on 26 September 1986 by the filing on that date of a Statement of Claim.  It
relates to a publication in <i>The Weekend Australian </i>published on 24-25
May 1986.  The evidence upon which the applicants rely is constituted by two
affidavits of the applicants' solicitors,
P J Campion, sworn 26 June 1998, 1
September 1998;  Exhibit A being an affidavit of Claire Alice Birabello sworn
on 23 January 1992;
 that affidavit was filed on behalf of the plaintiff in an
action brought by him in the Administrative Law Division against the Department
of Public Prosecutions which ultimately was successful in having stayed certain
criminal proceedings sought to be instituted against
the plaintiff.  The Court
of Appeal dismissed the DPP's appeal from the Orders made by Allen J on 2
October 1992.  Exhibit B is constituted
by Volumes II and IV of the Report of
<i>"Royal Commission into Deep Sleep Therapy</i>".  Exhibit C is a letter from
the Registry of this Court dated 22 April 1998 to be solicitors for the
plaintiff advising of a callover
on 7 May 1998 of "<i>dormant" </i>causes in
which this action was listed.
<P>

2   	Evidence for the plaintiff in opposition to the Motion was
constituted by an affidavit of D. A. G. Geddes sworn 6 May 1998
(solicitor for
the plaintiff) and an affidavit of the plaintiff sworn 24 June 1998.  The
plaintiff was cross-examined.
<P>

3   	The article complained of was concerned with allegations as
to the conduct of a number of doctors (including the plaintiff)
whilst at
Chelmsford Private Hospital.  In particular the article stated "<i>an inquest
into Podio's death found a prima facie of criminal negligence against Dr Bailey
and Dr Herron and psychiatrist Dr Ian Donald
Russell Gardiner who both gave
Podio shock treatment and a Director of Chelmsford, General Practitioner, Dr
john Ewan MacDonald Gill,
who also attended Podio".</i>
<P>

4   	The original Statement of Claim pleaded five imputations
arising from the whole of the article written by the first defendant
(Eatts)
and published by the second defendant (News).  
<P>

5   	From the material arising from the affidavits and other
documents by way of submissions a chronology can be constructed as
follows:
<P>

24 May 1986	Publication of article complained of
<P>

14 June 1986	Publication by defendants of apology:  "<i>The Weekend Australian
of 24 May stated that an inquest into the death of Miriam </i>(sic)
<i>Podium</i> (sic)<i> had found a prima facie case of criminal negligence
against John Ewan MacDonald Gill.  There has never been a finding of a prima
facie case of criminal negligence against Dr Gill at any inquest, tribunal,
Court (either formal or informal) or of any kind.  Any
suggestion to the
contrary is totally false.  The Weekend Australian retracts any such suggestion
and sincerely apologises to Dr
Gill for the error".</i>
<P>

26 September 1986	Statement of Claim filed together with Notice of Motion for
directions.
<P>

3 November 1986	Amended Statement of Claim filed.
<P>

4 November 1986	Notice of Appearance by News.
<P>

14 November 1986	Directions.
<P>

11 December 1986	Notice of Motion by News (re capacity).
<P>

6 February 1987	Plaintiff given leave to Amend Statement of Claim by Hunt J.
<P>

17 February 1987	Further Amended Statement of Claim filed by plaintiff pleading
two imputations:  
<P>

(a) that he had so misconducted himself as to warrant his being put on trial
for criminal negligence in respect of the death of
Miriam Podio.
<P>

(b) that he was a person who had a case to answer in respect of the death of
Miriam Podio.
<P>

20 February 1987		Directions by Hunt J.

<P>

<P>

<P>

22 February 1989	Letter from plaintiff's solicitors requesting re-relisting of
the matter to have it stood out of the List pending
the outcome of the Royal
Commission.
<P>

17 March 1989	Matter stood over generally with liberty to apply. 
<P>

March 1990		Royal Commission hearings end.
<P>

17 October 1990	Plaintiff's solicitors to defendants solicitors re discovery
and dispensing with the formalities thereof in relation
to Royal Commission
documents.
<P>

17 December 1990	Royal Commission report issues.
<P>

12 July 1991	Follow-up letter from plaintiff's solicitors to defendants
solicitors.
<P>

30 July 1991	Defendants solicitors to plaintiff's advising, <i>inter alia</i>,
of attempts to contact to Eatts in relation to any documents in her possession
and advising that News had had no access to her documents
in the Royal
Commission.
<P>

28 August 1991	Defendants solicitors to plaintiff's solicitors advising that
neither Eatts nor News were represented during the
course of the Royal
Commission though the former had been subpoenaed to produce documents.  News
did not have access to material
produced in the Commission.  It is stated that
only the plaintiff "<i>should discover the additional material in his
possession and control"</i>.
<P>

17 April 1998	Matter listed for call-over on 7 May 1998.
<P>

27 April 1998	Notice of change of address for service by plaintiff.
<P>

6 May 1998		Affidavit of plaintiff's solicitor re delay.
<P>

7 May 1998		Stood over by Levine J to a date to be fixed.
<P>

29 May 1998	Stood over to Defamation List on 26 June 1998 with Directions as to
any Notice of Motion for dismissal for want of prosecution.
<P>

23 June 1998		Notice of Motion by defendants filed.
<P>

4September 1998		Applications heard.
<P>

6   	At this point several salient matters are to be noted:
first, until the Royal Commission was foreshadowed the action in the
Defamation
List had been proceeding unremarkably.  Secondly, upon the Royal Commission
being announced the plaintiff made a conscious
decision not to prosecute the
defamation action and had it stood out of the List.  With propriety the
defendants and of course the
Court were notified.  Thirdly, prior to the
publication of the Report of the Royal Commission the plaintiff's solicitors in
the letter
dated 17 October 1990 indicated their client's intention to bring
the matter on for hearing.  Thereafter there was the exchange of
correspondence
to which I have referred and which is annexed to Mr Geddes affidavit of 6 May
1998.  That correspondence indicates
"<i>activity</i>" between the solicitors
for the parties up until August 1991, that is, some nine months after the issue
of the Report of the Royal
Commission.  On its face what appears to have
triggered the "<i>revival</i>" of activity in this action was the listing of
the action in the Dormant Causes List on 7 May (see Exhibit C).
<P>

7   	Thus, there is the gap between 28 August 1991 and 22 April
1998 - 6 years and 8 months. 
<P>

8   	What was the position of the defendants during this
period?
<P>

9   	In his affidavit of 22 June 1998 Mr Campion solicitor for
the defendants (he was not cross-examined), deals with the last exchange
of
correspondence to which I have referred.  He deposes to the plaintiff not
responding to his letter of 28 August 1991 and his subsequent
forming the view
that the matter would not proceed.  He closed the file and put it into storage
and did not pursue the question of
discovery.  Mr Campion also deposes to
having sought to locate the first defendant (Eatts) upon the notification of
the re-listing
of the matter in May 1998.  He has been unable to contact her
and does not know her present whereabouts.
<P>

10   	In paragraph 12 of his affidavit Mr Campion deposes to the
effect that during the course of the proceedings of the Royal Commission
evidence was revealed which "<i>made available to the defendant defences under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i>".  I understand from that
paragraph that that <i>"evidence at that time</i>" made available those
defences to his clients.  He goes on to say that such evidence would have
"<i>established the truth of the following imputations: </i>
<P>

<i>(1)	that the plaintiff, as a medical practitioner, had so conducted himself
in relation to the treatment of patients at Chelmsford
Hospital that he ought
to be suspended or de-registered as a medical practitioner;</i>
<P>

<i>(2) 	the plaintiff was so involved in the death of Miriam Podio that he
ought to be suspended or de-registered from medical practice;</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	that there was sufficient evidence concerning the plaintiff's role as a
medical practitioner in the death of a patient to warrant
him being charged
with criminal negligence".</i>
<P>

11   	Mr Campion deposes to the Royal Commission making findings
concerning the plaintiff's involvement in the death of Miriam Podio
and John
Adams in 1977.  He then goes on to say (paragraph 14):
<P>

<i>"Had the plaintiff revived the claim in 1991 it may have been possible for
the second defendant to have access to and to preserve
that evidence in support
of its case at any trial".</i>
<P>

12   	This statement is a little curious.  As at "<i>1991</i>",
certainly up until 28 August, it cannot be said that the plaintiff had
abandoned the action.  Arguably it was open to the defendant
<i>then</i>, to
seek to amend its Defence to plead these contextual imputations.  As I
understand the defendants' position in this application
it is that by reason of
the six year plus delay and the events occurring in excess of 20 years ago, the
defendant is prejudiced in
terms of its access to documents at the very least.
This position of the defendants is reinforced in submissions by reliance upon
the affidavit sworn on 23 July 1992, (that is, less than one year after there
was still some activity between the parties in the
defamation action), of Ms
Mirabello in the plaintiff's stay application against the Department of Public
Prosecutions which stay
application was successful in the light of evidence
contained in paragraphs 112 and 113 of Ms Mirabello's affidavit as to the
actual
prejudice suffered by the plaintiff in 1992 in what I consider to be the
same areas of the proposed contextual imputations the defendants
raised in 1998
as having been available to be proved by evidence in 1991.  This paradoxical
situation is relevant, in my view, to
both fault, if any, on the part of the
defendants' and the discrete question of prejudice itself.  
<P>

13   	In his affidavit of 1 September 1998 Mr Campion deposes to
inquiries being made of the Nurses Registration Board of this State
as to then
current whereabouts of nurses who appear from various records to have attended
Ms Podio during the period 28 July 1977
to 12 August 1977.  A letter from the
Board is annexed to the affidavit which appears to indicate that of the
thirteen nominated
nurses as at August 1998 six only are recorded as still
being registered and in respect of two of whom there is some doubt as to
identity.  
<P>

14   	In his first affidavit Mr Campion refers to certain
adverse findings recorded by the Royal Commission against the plaintiff
and
widespread publicity attending such findings during 1990 and 1991.  This, as I
understand it, is tendered as evidence to found
the belief in the defendants'
that after August 1991 the plaintiff no longer wanted to prosecute the claim.
It is asserted that as
a consequence the defendants' have lost the opportunity
of access to evidence which would enable it to defend a claim or to enable
a
fair trial.  
<P>

15   	What was the plaintiff's position during this six year
plus gap, by reference to the affidavits? (I shall refer to his oral
evidence
below).
<P>

16   	The affidavit seeks to show Dr Gill to have been very busy
indeed.  The progress of the defamation action has been referred
to above.
From his affidavit sworn on 24 June 1998 it appears the following events
impinged upon Dr Gill's life.  The Royal Commission
report was delivered on 24
December 1990.  In or about March 1991 the plaintiff was the subject of a
complaint to the Medical Tribunal
in relation to a Ms Adams.  In the same month
he received notification from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions
that
he was to face charges and additionally, a further complaint was lodged
against him in the Medical Tribunal in April.
<P>

17   	On 21 June a summons was filed in the Court of Appeal
seeking a stay of the Medical Tribunal complaints;  a judgment was delivered
on
19 November 1991 in the plaintiff's favour.
<P>

18   	In or about February 1992 eight or ten civil claims were
instituted against Dr Gill.  
<P>

19   	On 16 April 1992 two informations were laid against him by
the DPP.  Allen J stayed these informations on 2 October 1992,
that stay was
affirmed by the Court of Appeal in March 1993 and by the High Court in April
1993.  
<P>

20   	The final judgment of the Court of Appeal permanently
staying the criminal proceedings was given on Thursday 20 May 1993.
<P>

21   	In June 1993 the solicitor for the DPP advised the
plaintiff that no further action relating to criminal matters was to be
taken.
Thus by June 1993 both criminal and disciplinary proceedings were at an end.
Between March 1991 and June 1993 Dr Gill stated
that he was totally preoccupied
and involved in defending himself in relation to both the disciplinary and
criminal proceedings.
 His legal advisers advised him not to take any further
steps in relation to any "<i>other</i>" proceedings whilst those matters were
on foot.
<P>

22   	In August 1993 approximately 100 civil actions were
commenced in this Court in about 60 of which the plaintiff was a defendant.
Annexed to the affidavit is a schedule of these proceedings.
<P>

23   	Dr Gill swore that prior to August 1993 he had sought
advice about continuing the defamation proceedings but before any steps
could
be taken he was as-it-were inundated with the civil litigation.
<P>

24   	Dr Gill then deposes to various procedural steps taken by
him during the course of the progress of this civil litigation in
which he was
not the sole defendant and in which, as I understand it, conflicts arose as
between defendants.  From December 1994
steps were taken by Dr Gill as
defendant to have the civil proceedings against him disposed of.  This appears
to have been achieved
with a remarkable degree of success to the point that the
only outstanding matter at the time of the hearing of this present application
was a matter in respect of which there was a <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i> application
to be heard in the District Court.
<P>

25   	He deposes to press coverage of the Royal Commission and
steps taken after the Royal Commission by the Department of Health
seeking to
restrict his involvement in other investments which has lead, I gather, to
further litigation.
<P>

26   	He states that at no stage since 1989 has any defendant in
the proceedings sought to have the matter re-listed or sought to
bring the
matter on for hearing or have written to the plaintiff requesting that the
matter be resolved or be listed for hearing.
 Obviously of course at no stage
since at least 1991 has the plaintiff taken any such step either.
<P>

27   	He refers to Mr Campion's deposing to certain findings of
the Royal Commission and in paragraph 51 of his affidavit Dr Gill
states that
the findings of the Royal Commission and the evidence involved in those
proceedings are matters about which the defendant
can seek admissions by way of
Notice to Admit or by way of interrogatories.  He then goes on to say "<i>the
only person who could be prejudiced by those proceedings or by the existence of
the Royal Commission findings will be any person
seeking to disprove those
findings"</i>.  This is a curious sentence.  One construction of it is that the
plaintiff, Dr Gill, would be prejudiced by seeking to disprove
the adverse
findings of the Royal Commission by reason of the very matters of prejudice
upon which he relied in 1992, presumably,
for example.  I frankly do not quite
understand what the plaintiff is driving at in this sentence.  Whether it can
be taken that
he would not dispute the findings of Royal Commission is
uncertain.
<P>

28   	Annexed to the plaintiff's affidavit is a communication
with the Archives Authority of New South Wales but no response thereto
other
than by the plaintiff deposing to receiving information that whilst the
Archives Authority holds the documents a "<i>listing cannot be made available
... due to the provision of the Privacy Act".</i>  It is stated that
nonetheless apparently, during the course of the other civil proceedings Royal
Commission documents were the subject
of subpoenas.
<P>

29   	In paragraph 42 of his affidavit Dr Gill explains
significantly that the reason for the sending of the letter in February
1989 to
have the matter removed from the Defamation List was it the then anticipation
that the hearing of the defamation actions
would clash with the hearing of the
Royal Commission and the prosecutions said to be under way.
<P>

30   	This in general outline is the position of the parties on
the affidavit evidence in this action.  I shall refer to the significant
oral
evidence arising from the cross-examination of Dr Gill in due course.
<P>

<b>Gill v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Nast &amp; McEwin
(21926/86)</b>
<P>

31   	The Further Amended Statement of Claim (amended by
consent) filed in June 1987 is structured in this way:  the first defendant
(ABC) is sued in respect of a series of broadcasts from 26 October 1985 to 31
November 1985.  Six imputations are pleaded.
<P>

32   	The second defendant (Nast) and the third defendant
(McEwin) are sued as publishers of the words attributed to them to the
ABC and
as being responsible for the re-publication by the ABC.  The plaintiff
allocates to the second and third defendants various
of the imputations pleaded
globally against the ABC.  It is to be noted that in respect of the second
defendant there is no material
in the schedule in the Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim identifying her as to the person to whom particular words
were attributed.
 She may be the former matron to whom reference is made;  in
her defence she makes no admission as to the publication of the words
but the
denies intention of further publication by the ABC.  This is a technical defect
in the plaintiff's pleading that I merely
mention in passing.
<P>

33   	A chronology appears to be as follows:
<P>

October - November 1985	Publication of the matter complained of.
<P>

3 December 1986	Statement of Claim together with Notice of Motion for
directions.
<P>

17 February 1987		Amended Statement of Claim filed.

<P>

9 May 1988				Plaintiff serves interrogatories.
<P>

7 September 1988		Second defendant's List of Documents.
<P>

34   	Thereafter there follows the course of the history
involving the appointment and hearing of the Royal Commission and notice
given
by the plaintiff to the defendants of his intention to stand the defamation
matter out of the List generally.
<P>

35   	Each of the defendants (separately represented) moves the
Court that the proceedings be struck out for want of prosecution.
<P>

36   	For the ABC an affidavit was sworn on 28 June 1998 by Ms
Judith Walker, solicitor.  She sets out the chronology referred to
above and
deposes to having examined copies of hospital notes covering the treatment of
Ms Podio at Chelmsford for the period July
- August 1977.  Dr Bailey is now
deceased, he was the treating psychiatrist and the notes also indicated
treatment by Doctors Herron,
Gardiner and Gill.  Nursing staff are identified
as having assisted in the treatment of Ms Podio with the second defendant (not
presently
in Australia) and there is other named persons.  Ms Walker has made
inquiries of the Nurses Registration Board of the ten nurses
of which three
only were registered in 1998, three of whom have addresses in 1986, 1987 and
1982.  
<P>

37   	This defendant states that if the action is to proceed it
will seek leave to amend the Defence by pleading a series of contextual
imputations as follows:
<P>

<i>"(i)	The plaintiff's conduct as a medical practitioner at the Chelmsford
Private Hospital had been such as to result in the bringing
of proceedings
against the plaintiff by the NSW Department of Health before an Investigating
Committee established under the </i><cite>Medical Practitioners Act</cite><i>,
1938.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	The plaintiff administered deep sleep therapy to patients at Chelmsford
Private Hospital in circumstances where the plaintiff
knew that this treatment
was highly dangerous.</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	The plaintiff administered deep sleep therapy to patients at
Chelmsford Private Hospital in circumstances where the plaintiff
ought too have
known that this treatment was highly dangerous.</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	The plaintiff allowed the administration of deep sleep therapy to
patients at Chelmsford Private Hospital in circumstances where
the plaintiff
knew that this treatment was highly dangerous.</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	The plaintiff allowed the administration of deep sleep therapy to
patients at Chelmsford Private Hospital in circumstances where
the plaintiff
ought to have known that this treatment was highly dangerous".</i>
<P>

38   	It is said that this gives rise potentially to issues at
trial including the administration of deep sleep therapy over the
period 1963
to 1979 and the circumstances surrounding the deaths of seventeen people.
Presumably this is relied upon as an allegation
of prejudice, insofar as it
implies that, at such a time distance, the obtaining of evidence to support
these further contextual
imputations would be an onerous endeavour.  It is
arguably prejudice.  It can be apprehended that the reason why this material is
only now being sought to be introduced is the report of the Royal Commission.
The position of the ABC is not dissimilar to that of
News.  If that be the case
then the plaintiff can hardly be held to blame for the fact that the ABC finds
it difficult to prove events
from the late 60s and early 70s.  The plaintiff
can legitimately ask what further prejudice has been occasioned in the passage
of
time from 1990 when the report came out.  The difference here of course is
that there is no evidence to indicate that there was any
inter parties activity
at or after the time the Royal Commission report was issued, as was the case
with News.
<P>

39   	The ABC has defended the proceedings on the basis of a
defence of s 15 in relation to 3 of the imputations and pleaded 4 contextual
imputations in respect of which the contextual imputations set out would be
sought to be in substitution.  The originally pleaded
contextual imputations
are as follows:
<P>

<i>"(a)	related to matters of public interest and were published contextually
to the following imputations:</i>
<P>

<i>The plaintiff's conduct as a medical practitioner at the Chelmsford Private
Hospital had been such as to result in the bringing of
proceedings against the
plaintiff in October 1985 and February, 1986 by the NSW Department of Health
before an Investigating Committee
established under the Medical Practitioners
Act, 1938 in relation to the treatment of Miriam Podio and John Adams
respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>	(which was a matter of substantial truth and also related to matters of
public interest) and by reason of the substantial truth of
the said contextual
imputation the said imputations in question did not further injure the
reputation of the plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	related to matters of public interest and were published contextually to
the following imputation:</i>
<P>

<i>The plaintiff's conduct as a medical practitioner at the Chelmsford Private
Hospital had been such as to result in the bringing of
proceedings against the
plaintiff in October 1985 and February, 1986 by the NSW Department of Health
before an Investigating Committee
established under the Medical Practitioners
Act, 1938 in relation to the treatment of Miriam Podio and John Adams
respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>	(which was a matter of substantial truth and published under qualified
privilege) and by reason of the substantial truth of the said
contextual
imputation; the said imputations in question did not further inure the
reputation of the plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	were published under qualified privilege and contextually to the
following imputation:</i>
<P>

<i>The plaintiff's conduct as a medical practitioner at the Chelmsford Private
Hospital had been such as to result in the bringing of
proceedings against the
plaintiff in October 1985 and February, 1986 by the NSW Department of Health
before an Investigating Committee
established under the Medical Practitioners
Act, 1938 in relation to the treatment of Miriam Podio and John Adams
respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>	(which was a matter of substantial truth and related to matters of public
interest) and by reason of the substantial truth of the
said contextual
imputation the said imputations in question did not further injure the
reputation of the plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	were published under qualified privilege and contextually to the
following imputation:</i>
<P>

<i>	The plaintiff's conduct as a medical practitioner at the Chelmsford Private
Hospital had been such as to result in the bringing of
proceedings against the
plaintiff in October 1985 and February, 1986 by the NSW Department of Health
before an Investigating Committee
established under the Medical Practitioners
Act, 1938 in relation to the treatment of Miriam Podio and John Adams
respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>	(which was a matter of substantial truth and published under qualified
privilege) and by reason of the substantial truth of the said
contextual
imputation the said imputations in question did not further injure the
reputation of the plaintiff".</i>
<P>

40   	The second defendant (represented by the Legal Aid
Commission of New South Wales) is out of the country.  An affidavit sworn
28
August 1998 by C N Grey, solicitor sets out a chronology relevant to his client
and indicates that the last contact his office
had had from the plaintiff's
solicitors was a letter dated 6 February 1991 dealing with discovery.  That
letter is not annexed. 
In any event, after the matter was restored to the List
on 7 May 1998, a letter was sent to the second defendant's last known address
in Tasmania, no reply was received.  A conversation with the second defendant's
daughter-in-law in May 1998 indicated that the second
defendant was travelling
overseas.  A telephone conversation took place between the second defendant who
was then in London and the
deponent on 24 June 1998 in which he was instructed
that she had resigned and had left Australia indefinitely and had obtained
employment
with a nursing agency in London, that it would cause her financial
hardship to have to return to Australia for a hearing and she
was not in
contact with nor was she aware of the whereabouts of any of her colleagues from
Chelmsford Hospital.
<P>

41   	The third defendant, Dr Roderick McEwin was Chairman of
the New South Wales Health Commission in the period 1975 to 1978 according
to
his affidavit sworn on 28 August 1998 at which time he was 77 years of age.  He
retired from the NSW Health Commission in 1982.
  The plaintiff alleges against
the third defendant that the words attributed to him in the matter complained
of convey the imputation
that the plaintiff was "<i>guilty of professional
negligence in respect of the prescription of sedative drugs for patients at the
Chelmsford Private Hospital</i>".
<P>

42   	This imputation is in the Further Amended Statement of
Claim filed in June 1987.  The pleaded imputation was the subject of
a judgment
of Hunt J on 3 September 1987 in which his Honour allowed that imputation to go
to the jury.  By his Defence Dr McEwin
justifies pursuant to s 15 and pleads
contextual imputations pursuant to s 16 (see Defence of third defendant filed
on 9 February
1988).  Defences of qualified privilege have also been filed on
behalf of this defendant and interrogatories answered especially
in relation
thereto.  Dr McEwin is in the position of having justified prior to the
findings of the Royal Commission and it is difficult
at this point to see on
his evidence what the particular prejudice is save for the passage of time.  In
his affidavit Dr McEwin refers
to what I will simply call memory problems in
relation to issues raised in the plaintiff's Reply particularly in terms of the
information
he had at the time of the publication complained of and any
inquiries he made.  The position of the plaintiff in relation to Dr McEwin's
difficulties with memory is of course that on 1 November 1988 Dr McEwin was
able to answer the interrogatories delivered by the plaintiff
on these
subjects.
<P>

43   	The second defendant as I understand it has pleaded
comment only, as a substantive defence.  
<P>

44   	Thus in relation to the three defendants, save as to the
reference in the affidavit of the solicitor for the second defendant
to some
communication in relation to the discovery in 1991, it otherwise appears that
these matters were ready to be set down after
progressing through the
Defamation List until the time came for the plaintiff to take the step to have
the matter stood over generally
by reason of the Royal Commission.
<P>

45   	The "<i>gap"</i> of six years plus referred to in the News
Limited matter is explained in this action in similar terms by Dr Gill in an
affidavit
sworn on 24 June 1998.  This affidavit appears to be directed to the
evidence filed in support of the application by the ABC.  Again
the plaintiff
appears to be relying upon the existence of records of the Royal Commission and
the examination of the Miriam Podio
case.  He again asserts that "<i>the only
person who could now be prejudiced by the existence of those findings (adverse
to the plaintiff) will be a purpose seeking
to disprove them"</i> (paragraph
51).  The same proposition is asserted in paragraph 57 with respect to the
findings of the Royal Commission generally.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Evidence </b>
<P>

46   	The plaintiff was cross-examined by Mr Sexton for the ABC
and Mr Nicholas Q.C. for News.
<P>

47   	I was unimpressed by Dr Gill as a witness.  I did not and
do not consider him to have been a witness of candour or reliability.
<P>

48   	In relation to the history of the proceedings upon the
conclusion of the disciplinary and criminal matters the following evidence
was
given:
<P>

<i>"Q.	 At that stage in June 1993 with the end of the criminal and the
disciplinary proceedings, what was your attitude in relation
to this defamation
action against the ABC?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Well, as set out in the affidavit in early 1989 I, on the advice of a
solicitor, he had asked that it be set aside - sorry, not
set aside, put on
hold indefinitely or until a more opportune time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	What I was asking was when the criminal and disciplinary proceedings
came to a conclusion in June 1993 did you look forward to
re-starting the
action against the ABC?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	At that stage I had some 60 or 70 or a large number of civil proceedings
which were of great concern to me.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	Did you raise this matter with your solicitors?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I believe so, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	As to whether the action against the ABC could be usefully re-started at
that time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I raised it, it was discussed as to what should be done about it.  I took
the advice I was given. </i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	I won't ask you what that advice was at the moment except to say, did
you ask your solicitors whether it was possible to re-commence
the proceedings
against the ABC?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	It would have been part of the discussion.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	When you say part of the discussion did you ask that question?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I cannot recall the nature of the discussion but the matter arose and it
was decided to take the course I took.  I cannot recall
whether I asked the
question or whether it was put to me or I was told.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	There is a period, you would see, from your own affidavit of two months
at July/August 1993, between the cessation of the civil
and criminal
proceedings and, seemingly, the commencement of the civil proceedings, do you
accept that?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	There had been a number of civil proceedings commenced earlier than
that. I am not sure if my affidavit made that clear and a
number commenced as
late as September 1993.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	Do  I take it though from your affidavit in par 27, that at the end of
August 1993 there was a large block of civil proceedings
filed?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	100-odd and 60 of them with yourself named as a defendant?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	What I was asking was whether in that two months of July/August 1993 you
considered re-starting the defamation action against
the ABC?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I think we have some problems in that I worded par 27 inaccurately in
the sense that I don't know that the whole of these proceedings
were started on
or about 29 August but there were proceedings on foot that had commenced as
early as 1990 and I apologise for not
making that clear in that
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	You said you cannot recall whether you specifically raised the question
of re-starting with your solicitors but you said there
were some discussions
about the subject?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	The matter was raised on various occasions over various times,
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	When you say at various times prior to the conclusion of the criminal
and disciplinary proceedings?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I don't think it was seriously considered prior to that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	But at the end of this it was seriously considered?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I don't know that it was seriously considered until the civil
proceedings were disposed of".</i>
<P>

49   	The last answer is surprising insofar as it reflects
either a poor memory or indifference to a very critical consideration.
 It
makes it difficult to come to a view as to whether the plaintiff seriously
sought advice during the period governed by this exchange
or was given any as
the plaintiff would have the Court believe and if so, what its nature was.  At
the end Dr Gill simply did not
know whether the revival of the action against
the ABC was seriously considered until the civil proceedings were disposed of -
he
civil proceedings, the sixty or so of them were disposed of without a
hearing on the merits as to liability or damages and on Dr
Gill's own
initiative in most cases, as I understand it.  At the time of the hearing of
the present application there was only outstanding
a limitations application in
relation Kahn.  
<P>

50   	The basis for at the very least uncertainty if not
rejection of the plaintiff's position in this matter is reinforced by the
following:
<P>

<i>"Q. 	My question was, what steps if any did you take in August 1997 to
re-start the proceedings against the ABC?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I think the matter was raised at some appropriate time and I on advice,
or my solicitors did not do anything at that time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	Did you ask them to?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	The matter was discussed I think and -</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	I am sorry?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	The matter was raised and the action we took was the result of the
advice or what was decided.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	Who was it raised by?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I am not sure whether it was my self or my solicitors.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	You are saying that you may not have even raised it yourself?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Well, if I didn't they did and it was discussed.  If you are asking me
who initiated it, I cannot recall whether it was them or
I.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	Did you say "Why can't we re-start this action?"</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	I would have asked about whether we should and why we should not and
listen to the answers.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	What reason was there as far as you were concerned?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	There were still these unresolved matters between myself, as I outlined
before, and also the Kahn matter.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	The Kahn matter still has not been resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	The Kahn matter was to come to hearing in May and then was to come to
hearing in August and has now been set for hearing in October.
 So, you are
asking me what was my view of the Kahn matter in September 1997 and I presumed,
I thought it would come to hearing in
May 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	What I am suggesting is in August 1997 you did not take any steps to
re-start the action against the ABC?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Other than to take advice on the matter.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	You did not evince any enthusiasm for re-starting the action against the
ABC, you were not interested in it at that stage?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	That is quite right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. 	Did you still plan at that stage to take it up some time later?</i>
<P>

<i>A. 	Yes".</i>
<P>

51   	With respect to the matter being called up by the Court in
May 1998 Dr Gill said his reaction was that the matter should go
ahead and he
instructed his solicitor.  He said that he did have it in mind even if it had
not been called up to restart as soon
as the matter Kahn matter had been
finished which he said had been put off on a "<i>three month by three month
basis</i>".  He asserted a difficulty in resources and time "<i>at what my
lawyers advise me to do and what they think is appropriate</i>" in running the
residue of the Kahn matter and the ABC matter.  The "<i>bottom line</i>" of the
advice presumably given at the time the Court called the matter up was to
commence these defamation actions with "<i>full force as soon as the Kahn
matter had been resolved"</i>.  When it was suggested that running both actions
at the same time would give rise to some problem, Dr Gill said, "<i>I don't
recall any suggestion of legal hindrance.  There is a problem in maintaining
many actions simultaneously</i>".  Dr Gill was asked:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Can I suggest to you again that if the Court had not called this matter
up it would never have been re-started?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  As I outlined to you that was written long after.  It was my
intention when the Kahn matter was finished, it may have been
May, it may have
been October".</i>
<P>

52   	I do not accept this answer.
<P>

53   	Mr Sexton went on to ask:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Do I take it from what you have said that you won't be able to prosecute
the defamation action until the Kahn proceedings are
completed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If I have to I will.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If you have to why couldn't you do that in August 1997?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As I said it would put particular strains on and on the advice which is
to take the course I did.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Because you did not chose to do it in August 1997?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because I chose to take the course I took".</i>
<P>

54   	What is clear is that the decision in 1989 to have the
matter removed from the List by reason of the then pending Royal Commission
was
a deliberate choice.  I understand as far as I am able from Dr Gill's evidence
that it was his choice to take the course he took
in August 1997.  As to what
that course is, I am not persuaded on the probabilities that it was that
ventured by the witness, namely,
to prosecute with full vigour after the
settlement of the Kahn case or its resolution.  At this point I can make it
abundantly clear
that I am of the view that had the Court not called the matter
up as a dormant cause, no step would have been taken by this plaintiff
to
prosecute his actions against any of the defendants.
<P>

55   	In cross-examination by Mr Nicholas Q.C. Dr Gill said that
until he was given such advice to proceed the conclusion of the
Kahn litigation
it was not his intention to proceed.
<P>

56   	This seems to be more available as a finding by reason of
the following exchange:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Just to clear up something that you said in answer to my question, we
can take it can't we, that had your solicitor not contacted
you and given you
that advice you would have taken no step to revive these defamation action
until such time as to the Kahn matters
had been concluded?  That is correct is
it not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct".</i>
<P>

57   	Pertinently Dr Gill went on to volunteer that the sixty
civil matters were financially overwhelming to him and the "<i>defamation may
have raised matters that somehow put me at risk</i>".  This became clear in the
concluding exchange between the cross-examiner and this witness:
<P>

<i>"Q.	What is the nature of the risk?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The risk is that I be involved in cross-examination and make statements
which no doubt the plaintiff's solicitors in the other
matters would pore over
and seek to use to my disadvantage which would be a financially crippling
matter.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It would be tactically disadvantageous to you in the conduct of your
other litigation to revive the defamation proceedings?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is more than that because the other litigation was extraordinary
threatening".</i>
<P>

58   	Thus, at this point, I can summarise as follows:
<P>

(a) 	in 1989 there was a conscious decision not to proceed with any of the
defamation actions by reason of the pending Royal Commission;
 this decision
was conveyed to the defendants by the application to have the matter removed
generally from the Defamation List;
<P>

(b)  	after the Royal Commission the plaintiff in fact did not proceed with the
defamation actions and in two instances, namely,
News and the second defendant
in the ABC matter there was some degree of "life" in the actions on the part of
the defendants relating
in some way to discovery;
<P>

(c)  	after the disciplinary and criminal proceedings had been disposed of the
plaintiff did not proceed
<P>

(d)	during and toward the end of the sixty-odd civil proceedings the plaintiff
did not proceed.
<P>

59   	All of these failures to proceed, as far as one can
gather, appear to have been conscious decisions on the part of the
plaintiff.
<P>

(e)	of critical importance during the course of the civil proceedings it
appears that the consciousness of the decisions not to
proceed with the
defamation actions was based upon tactical risk avoidance measures by the
plaintiff as a defendant in those proceedings;
<P>

(f)	I am satisfied that but for the matters being called up by the Court the
plaintiff would not have consciously decided to proceed
at all let alone at the
end of the Kahn matter.  I simply do not believe the plaintiff's testimony to
the contrary.
<P>

60   	Reviewing the chronology one of course can find periods of
unexplained gaps.  The most glaring is the delay between the publication
by the
ABC and the institution of proceedings.  That has not been explained nor was
the plaintiff cross-examined on it.
<P>

61   	The principles applicable to an application of this kind
have, with respect, been usefully summarised (since the argument
of these
applications) by Simpson J in <b><i>Hoser v Hartcher</i></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/527.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 527</a>,
2 June 1999.  The solicitors for the plaintiff reminded me in post-hearing
correspondence of this decision.  Her Honour articulates
the relevant
considerations in paragraphs 20-30 (pages 9 to 14).
<P>

62   	It is important to note that the circumstances of this
present application are quite different to those with which her Honour
was
concerned and, indeed, are different to those with which I was concerned in
<b><i>McBride v Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i></b> (unreported, 6
November 1998).  The interesting and important factor that attends the current
litigation is that as at 1989 when
the matter was removed from the list, save
for I suppose unremarkable lapses of time excepting the delay in the initiating
of proceedings
in the ABC case, the litigation had progressed to the point
where discovery and interrogatories had been effected and delivered and
answered.  In other words both sides had with a degree of diligence attended to
interlocutory steps to enable the matters otherwise
to be listed for hearing.
This is not a case where a charge can be levelled, for example, against the
defendants for not having put
on defences.  The issue is the failure of the
plaintiff to prosecute defamation proceedings which as at 1989 were in reality
ready
then for hearing but which were not listed by reason of the conscious
decision of the plaintiff to have his litigation removed from
the Defamation
List.
<P>

63   	As was pointed out in <b><i>Stollznow v Calvert</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 749</a> at 752 an application to strike out proceedings for want of
prosecution and an application for an extension of a limitation period
involved
similar considerations and similar principles.  It was submitted for the
defendants by Mr Nicholas that at issue in both
cases is a recognition of the
right of a citizen to a speedy hearing of an action that has been commenced:
<b><i>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR
541</a> at 552 per McHugh J;  <b><i>Herrron v McGregor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 246</a>
at 253.
<P>

64   	The requirement for the speedy hearing of an action arises
from the following considerations:  as time goes by relevant evidence
is likely
to be lost;  it is oppressive to have an action being pursued long after the
circumstances which gave rise to it have passed;
 there is a need for litigants
to order their affairs and it is in the public interest that disputes be
resolved as quickly as possible
(<b><i>Taylor</i></b> <i>(supra) </i>at
552-553).  
<P>

65   	Where there is a delay the whole "<i>quality</i>" of
justice deteriorates (<b><i>Taylor </i></b>at 551).  The deterioration in
quality may be palpable, for example, the loss of documents, the unavailability
of witnesses and the
dimming of memory (<b><i>Taylor </i></b>at 541;
<b><i>Stollznow</i></b> at 745D).  Prejudice may exist without the parties or
anyone else realising that it exists.  Evidence may disappear without anybody
knowing that it "<i>ever existed".</i>  Time will often diminish the
significance of a known fact or circumstance because its relationship to the
cause of action no longer
is apparent as it was when the cause of action arose
(<b><i>Taylor</i></b> at 551).  The general principle to be applied is whether
or not on balance justice demands that the action should be dismissed (see,
for
example, <b><i>Witten v Lombard Australia Limited</i></b> (1968) 88 WN(Pt 1)
NSW 405 at 412 per Walsh JA as applied in <b><i>Stollznow</i></b> at 751;  see
also <b><i>Spitfire Nominees Pty Limited v Ducco</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20VR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1 VR 242</a> at
246).
<P>

66   	A defendant, it is submitted, prima facie would be
entitled to have proceedings dismissed where, as it is submitted in this
case,
there has been a long delay (this cannot be questioned) which has given rise to
a substantial risk that it is not possible
to have a fair trial of the issues
in the actions or is otherwise likely to cause or to have caused serious
prejudice to the defendants.
 It is submitted that such circumstances have
arisen in the present litigation and to permit the proceedings to continue is
to permit
an unacceptable deterioration in the "<i>quality</i>" of justice.
This may not necessarily depend upon proving or identifying unavailable
witnesses or documents (<b><i>Masel v Transport Industries Insurance Co
Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1995/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] VicRp 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%202%20VR%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 2 VR 328</a> at 345;  <b><i>Spitfire Nominees</i></b> at
246;  <b><i>Burkett v James </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 297</a> at 318).  In this case the
relevant events took place in 1977;  the plaintiff in 1986 was able to
demonstrate prejudice to him in
part by the passage of time and in 1991, was
able to demonstrate that he himself had been put to significant disadvantage by
reason
of the elapse of time (<b><i>Gill v Walton</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 190</a>
at 200B).  In the News Limited case the whereabouts of the first defendant is
unknown.  In the ABC case the second defendant is clearly
unable to be
contacted and would be prejudiced in the communication of any matters of
instructions let alone attendance in this State.
 It is quite clear that the
whereabouts of certain of the witnesses, particularly nurses, is not known.
<P>

67   	I accept these submissions.  If looked at in strict
isolation the question of prejudice in relation to the defendants would
arguably be found not to be as serious as might arise in other cases.  There
are the absences of witnesses referred.  The third defendant
in the ABC
litigation has not unnaturally, memory difficulties relating to events said to
arise from the allegations in the plaintiff's
Reply that precede 1982.
Arguably the defendants are no worse off 9 years down the track than they were
in 1989 at which time the
defences including the defence of justification were
in fact on the record.  The plaintiff argues that all relevant testimony was
recorded by Coronial inquiries and the Royal Commission and are matters of
record and are susceptible to submissions and subpoenas.
 As to the former of
course Notices to Admit can be delivered but the plaintiff has given no
indication at all as to whether any
appropriate admissions would be made. 
<P>

68   	The plaintiff's statement in his affidavit that the only
person likely to be prejudiced by the findings adverse to him of
the Royal
Commission is anyone seeking to disprove is, as I have remarked, a very curious
one.  Having sworn to that proposition
on oath (he was not cross-examined on
it), the defendant must be seen to be in at least a position of a dilemma.  Is
the plaintiff
asserting that the defendants are not prejudiced because the
defendants are not going to dispute the findings?  Is the plaintiff
asserting
that he would accommodate the defendants in the quest for the truth of the
findings or the admissibility of evidence giving
rise to them by making
requisite admissions?
<P>

69   	As was submitted by Mr Lynch of counsel for the second
defendant in the ABC matter on the plaintiff's own evidence the purpose
of him
not prosecuting the proceedings was to secure an advantage to himself, to gain
a strategic benefit by not exposing himself
to cross-examination in the
defamation proceedings until the civil proceedings were resolved to his
satisfaction.  That was a conscious
and intentional act which he chose to
follow and put the defendants in the position of thinking that the proceedings
(ready for trial
in 1989) were effectively at an end.
<P>

70   	I agree with the submission that the delay was plainly
inordinate.  I reject what was plainly offered as an excuse.  The purported
excuses in the plaintiff's affidavit and oral evidence cannot be seen to be
excuses or explanations at all relevantly acceptable
when they are
characterised as deliberate choices on his part to secure tactical advantages
as a litigant in other causes - criminal,
disciplinary, Royal Commission and
civil actions.
<P>

71   	As was submitted by Mr Sexton the plaintiff deliberately
chose to avoid a forensic risk by prosecuting these proceedings vis-a-vis
the
other proceedings in which he was involved.  The delay involved a choice by the
plaintiff as to the way in which he might be
disadvantaged in one set of
proceedings notwithstanding the disadvantage caused to the defendants in other
proceedings.
<P>

72   	Submissions along these lines, which I accept, fall with
the statements of policy made in the speeches in the House of Lords
in
<b><i>Grovit v Doctor &amp; Ors</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] UKHL 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%201%20WLR%20640" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 1 WLR 640</a> and I am of the view
that the conduct of this litigation and the explanations that the plaintiff
sought to give for the inordinate
delay could (though I do not so decide),
amount to that kind of abuse of process to which their Lordships referred.
<P>

73   	In this instance the plaintiff as at 1989 had viable
defamation actions ready to be listed for hearing;  he chose not to pursue
that
course.  Thereafter he elected for tactical reasons not to pursue these
defamation actions to the obtain the advantages to which
reference has been
made in the submissions which I have rehearsed above.  He did not give credible
oral evidence before me to the
extent that I simply do not accept that it was
his intention to prosecute these actions and would have done so even if the
Supreme
Court had not called them up to be dealt with in the Dormant Cases
Callover.
<P>

74   	The prejudice to the defendants exists though not to a
very great degree and such that it is, and such that it was in 1989,
can only
have been aggravated by the lapse of time consequent upon the deliberate choice
made by the plaintiff.  Even though in the
light of the plaintiff's response to
the defendants' complaint about access to documents and records and its
curiously equivocal
nature, any prejudice the defendants have suffered is not
thereby ameliorated.  In my view, it is further aggravated.  
<P>

75   	All these factors sufficiently accord with principle to
warrant the success of the defendants' applications. 
<P>

76   	The formal orders are that in respect of each of the
Notices of Motion in both actions filed by the defendants the plaintiff's
action is dismissed for want of prosecution.
<P>

77   	The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the defendants of the
action and of the application.
<P>

78   	The exhibits are to be returned to the second defendant,
News.
