<b><u>70069/95 - REGINA  v  Scott Tikao LEWIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>ON SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>	On 15 February last Mr. Scott Tikao Lewis, ["the
prisoner"], was presented in this Court for trial upon an indictment containing
five counts. The first count in the indictment charged that the prisoner had
murdered, on 4 February 1994 at Campbelltown in this
State, one Damon Dennis,
["the victim"]. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against
him in the first count of
the indictment; but he offered a plea of guilty of
the manslaughter of the victim. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge
of the entire indictment. It becomes, therefore, unnecessary to consider the
remaining contents of the indictment as originally presented.
<P>

2	The prisoner was convicted formally of the manslaughter of the victim, and
was remanded thereupon in custody to Monday of last
week, 22 February, for the
commencement of proceedings on sentence. Those proceedings continued
intermittently throughout the whole
of last week. 
<P>

3	The prisoner was first arrested and charged on 8 February 1995. He was then
charged with the murder of the victim. In due course,
and during 1996, the
prisoner was tried upon indictment, and before Dowd J of this Court and a jury,
for the alleged murder of the
victim. The jury found the prisoner guilty as
charged, and he was sentenced subsequently to a substantial term of penal
servitude.
Later still, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed that conviction
and sentence, and ordered the prisoner's re-trial. It was that
re-trial order
that brought the prisoner before this Court on 15 February last. The prisoner
has been in unbroken custody since 8
February 1995.
<P>

4	During the course of the proceedings on sentence, the prisoner himself gave
extensive sworn evidence. This evidence contains,
among other things, the only
discursive narrative put before the Court as to the facts and circumstances
surrounding the death of
the victim. 
<P>

5	According to that version of the prisoner, he was at the material times a
member of a motor cycle club known as "The Rebels".
The prisoner says that he
went in company with a number of other members of the club, and at or shortly
after midnight on 4 February
1994, to the Mawson Park Tavern at Campbelltown.
He was standing alone on one of a number of steps leading from the street into
the
tavern. While standing in that position, and leaning against a nearby
handrail, the prisoner heard a commotion behind him. He turned
around and saw
the victim being pulled through the doorway of one of the tavern bars by a
member of the security staff known only
as "B.J". "B.J." apparently had some
difficulty in handling the victim, with the result that the victim hit the door
jamb and dropped
onto the landing near the prisoner. The victim's body was, the
prisoner thought, about half inside and half outside the relevant
doorway as he
lay on the ground after having been dropped by "B.J".
<P>

6	The prisoner says that he then saw another club member, known colloquially as
"Redeye", come upon the scene. "B.J." and "Redeye"
picked the victim up off the
floor and, in effect, dragged him down the steps towards the outside street
pavement. The victim was
calling out loudly in grossly abusive language. As the
three men passed by the place where the prisoner was standing, the prisoner
took hold of the victim's hair, which was curly shoulder-length hair. The
prisoner said that he did this in order to avoid the victim's
head striking the
steps should he be dropped on them by "B.J" and "Redeye". What in fact happened
was that the prisoner, "B.J" and
"Redeye", holding the victim, went down the
stairs onto the footpath outside the tavern premises; turned to the right; and
began
to move along the pavement and towards a large planter box standing
between the stairs of which I have been speaking and the driveway
of a drive-in
bottle shop forming part of the Mawson Park Tavern premises. The prisoner
released the victim's hair and "B.J" and
"Redeye" hauled the victim over to the
planter box and sat him on it. "B.J" then returned to the inside of the tavern
premises, leaving
"Redeye" standing near the victim; and leaving the prisoner
standing further away and towards the stairs giving out onto the foot-path
from
the interior of the tavern premises.
<P>

7	According to the prisoner, he said to "Redeye": <i>"Don't fucking leave him
there, he will start again"</i>. Thereupon, the prisoner and "Redeye" took hold
of the victim, each supporting the victim under the latter's armpit; and moved
around
the side of the planter box and into the bottle shop driveway. They
there manoeuvred the victim into such a position that he was
more or less
standing, slumped against the edge of the driveway wall closest to the planter
box. The prisoner then moved to return
to the tavern premises. As he did so, he
heard "Redeye" call to him for assistance; and the prisoner upon turning back
to see what
was happening with "Redeye" and the victim, saw the latter two men
grappling with each other. The prisoner walked over to where the
two men were
grappling, and <i>"elbowed (the victim) in the back of the head"</i>.
Thereafter, the prisoner tried once or twice, and unsuccessfully, to pin the
victim's arms behind his back; and then elbowed him
again in the back of the
head, more or less at the junction of the head and the neck. The prisoner then
<i>"hit (the victim) with the left fist twice on the side of the head"</i>.
This caused the victim to fall to the surface of the driveway. He was lying
face down on the surface of the driveway. The prisoner
thereupon <i>"laid the
boot into him a few times"</i>, probably five or six times. While these
assaults had been in train, three, and perhaps four, other members of the motor
cycle club
had come upon the scene and joined in a group assault of the victim.
The prisoner saw these additional assailants "stomping" on the
victim, that is
to say, stamping down on the victim with the soles of their shoes. 
<P>

8	According to the prisoner, he left the scene of this group assault while the
assault was still in progress; and very shortly thereafter
returned to the club
house of "The Rebels".
<P>

9	It is necessary to add to the foregoing version given by the prisoner a
number of other facts and circumstances that are established
by the
evidence.
<P>

10	<i>First</i>, the victim was a complete stranger to the prisoner. It is not
suggested that, apart from some passages of drunken and vulgar verbal
abuse,
the victim said anything to the prisoner, or that the victim did anything to
the prisoner, that might have provoked, or otherwise
explained, the prisoner's
participation in the assaulting of the victim.
<P>

11	<i>Secondly</i>, it is clear that, in addition to the beating, kicking and
"stomping" to which the prisoner's own evidence refers, some one or more
of the
victim's assailants stabbed the victim in the upper rear portion of each of the
victim's legs. The proceedings in connection
with the prisoner's sentencing
have been conducted on all sides upon the basis that the prisoner did not
inflict either of the two
stab wounds; did not see either of the wounds
actually inflicted; and saw nothing to make him aware at the time that either
or both
wounds had been inflicted in fact.
<P>

12	It remains the case, however, that the stab wounds were inflicted at some
time and by some person or persons, during the course
of the group assault of
the victim. And it is clear, in my opinion, that the end effect of the stab
wounds was to bring about the
death of the victim. Part of Exhibit C in the
present proceedings is evidence given by Dr. Bogdan Hulewicz on 1 July 1996,
and during
the course of the prisoner's first trial. According to Dr. Hulewicz
the immediate cause of death was <i>"multi-organ failure, this arising as a
consequence of haemorrhagic shock, and the haemorrhagic shock occurring as a
consequence of
stab wounds to the legs"</i>. Dr. Hulewicz explained
"haemorrhagic shock" as being <i>"shock occurring as a result of blood
loss"</i>.
<P>

13	Dr. Hulewicz's evidence details a large number of other injuries discovered
on post-mortem examination. Any present assessment
of this evidence needs to be
made with some care, because the victim did not die until 17 February 1994;
that is to say, until almost
a fortnight after the occurrence of the assaults
as I have earlier described them. Allowance needs to be made, - and Dr.
Hulewicz's
evidence does, indeed, make specific allowance, - for incidental
bruising caused by the handling in hospital of the victim's body.
All those
just qualifications made, it remains, in my opinion, a reasonable inference,
which I draw, that the assaults carried out
upon the victim outside the Mawson
Park Tavern were not trivial, but were both serious and sustained.
<P>

14	<i>Thirdly,</i> the prisoner's own participation in the assaults carried out
on the victim was aggravated by the fact that the prisoner was, at the
time of
his participation, in breach of parole, and was on conditional bail, in respect
of antecedent criminal offences.
<P>

15	The relevant facts in that regard are as follows: On 29 April 1988 the
prisoner was convicted in the District Court at Sydney,
of malicious wounding
with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The incident in question had
involved, so far as is at present particularly
relevant, the stabbing by the
prisoner of a young man with whom he had been having an altercation and a
fist-fight. The prisoner
was sentenced, according to the practice prior to the
coming into operation of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> (NSW)</b>, to penal
servitude for 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Both the head
sentence and the non-parole period were dated
from 31 March 1988. Following the
coming into operation of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>, the prisoner's sentence was
re-determined into the form of a minimum sentence of penal servitude for 1 year
11 months and 24 days
to date from 31 March 1988, and an additional term of 3
years 1 month and 20 days expiring on 14 May 1993. The minimum term thus
set
expired on 24 March 1990 and the prisoner was released to parole on 25 March
1990. The parole order pursuant to which the prisoner
was thus released, was
due to expire on 14 May 1993.
<P>

16	On 14 August 1991, the prisoner was convicted in the Bankstown Local Court
of having driven a motor vehicle while disqualified;
and of having given a
false name to the investigating police. In respect of the former matter, he was
sentenced to a fixed term of
imprisonment of six months. He immediately lodged
an appeal to the District Court. He was granted bail until such time as the
District
Court appeal might be disposed of. On 20 August 1991, the prisoner's
parole order was revoked. The prisoner's record with the New
South Wales Police
Service suggests that the District Court appeal was dismissed, in the
prisoner's absence, on 8.November 1991.
That same document also suggests,
however, that the same appeal was dismissed on 16 February 1995. I cannot find
in the evidence
before this Court any clear explanation of these two,
apparently inconsistent, entries in the Police Service record.
<P>

17	The prisoner's own evidence dealt with aspects of his criminal antecedents.
The evidence is not entirely clear as to the prisoner's
understanding as to the
operation of his parole order, and as to the effect upon it of his subsequent
Local Court convictions. Having
watched and listened to the prisoner as he gave
his evidence, I do not have any doubt that the prisoner understood the
obligations
that rested upon him in virtue of his parole order; that he
understood that his Local Court convictions gave rise to a real risk,
to say
the very least, that his parole would be revoked and that he would be returned
thereupon to his former custody; that he appealed
to the District Court in
order to put off that evil day; and that he understood that his bail pending
the resolution of his District
Court appeal was conditioned upon his in fact
prosecuting his appeal in the District Court. I am strengthened in those
conclusions
by the following evidence given by the prisoner during the course
of his re-examination:
<P>

	"Q.	When you left Sydney for Adelaide after the Mawson Tavern incident, the
assault on Mr. Dennis, were you aware whether or not
Mr. Dennis had at that
stage died?
<P>

	A.	No, I was not.
<P>

	Q.	Why did you go to Adelaide?
<P>

	A.	By being at the tavern and the assault took place, I assumed the police
would want to speak to me. My parole had been breached,
and I would have gone
to gaol. 
<P>

	Q.	Had you previously been told by a departmental officer, probation officer,
at some time earlier, that your parole had been breached?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I had.
<P>

	Q.	Were you aware, I take it then, that you were effectively giving yourself
up for some period of time.
<P>

	A.	That's correct.
<P>

	Q.	Following your kicking of Mr. Dennis at the Mawson Tavern, is it the fact
you went to Adelaide a number of weeks later?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	And at the time were you seeking to avoid arrest for breach of parole or
questioning concerning that kicking of Mr. Dennis?
<P>

	A.	Yes I was."
<P>

18	It should be added that the prisoner, having gone to Adelaide, there assumed
a false identity behind which he lived and worked
up until the time of his
surrender to the police in Adelaide on 8 February 1995.
<P>

19	It is now appropriate to explain the conclusions to which I have come
concerning the objective gravity of the offence of manslaughter
to which the
prisoner pleaded guilty. 
<P>

20	The prisoner pleaded guilty, and has been formally convicted, of
manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The relevant
law for Australia
is established by the High Court of Australia in <b>Wilson v The Queen
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20174%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 174 CLR 313.</a> The essential principles are stated as follows in the
relevant portion of the head note of the report of the decision:
<P>

	"For a person to be guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act,
the circumstances must be such that a reasonable man
in the accused's position
would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an
appreciable risk of serious injury.
It is not sufficient that there was a risk
of some harm resulting, albeit not serious harm."
<P>

21	The prisoner's plea is to be taken as admitting every essential element of
the offence in respect of which the plea has been
entered. That must entail,
having regard to the way in which both the Crown case and the prisoner's case
have been framed in connection
with the present proceedings on sentence, that
it is accepted by the prisoner that he was party to a group assault of the
victim
at a time when he knew that some, at least, of his fellow assailants
were armed with knives; and that the atmosphere and incidents
of the joint
assault were such that a reasonable person in his, the prisoner's, then
position would have realised that to participate
in such an assault in such
circumstances exposed the victim to an appreciable risk of serious injury by
stabbing.
<P>

22	Learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner did not contend that the prisoner's
participation in the assault which led to the death
of the victim could be
regarded as anything other than a serious case of manslaughter by an unlawful
and dangerous act. Counsel did
contend strenuously, however, that the
prisoner's offence could not be classified as the most serious kind of case of
manslaughter
by unlawful and dangerous act. I accept that submission; but I
think, nevertheless, that the present offence can only be regarded,
when looked
at sensibly as to its objective criminality, as a most serious criminal
offence. In that regard, I will make but two
particular points. 
<P>

23	<i>First</i>, a view of the facts most favourable to the prisoner shows an
assault upon a single victim by a group of four or five assailants.
Those odds
are, to put the point bluntly, coward's odds.
<P>

24	<i>Secondly</i>, a view of the facts most favourable to the prisoner
suggests that the victim had been making something of a nuisance of himself
both inside and outside the tavern premises. The evidence suggests that the
victim was well under the influence of alcohol and was
abusive and
obstreperous. None of that behaviour, it must be said plainly and firmly, made
the victim some kind of outlaw who could
be set upon with impunity by people
like the prisoner and the prisoner's fellow club members; and ill-treated, or
worse, in the supposed
interest of teaching him a supposedly necessary lesson.
The essential point cannot be put better, in my respectful opinion, than
was
done by Lord Templeman in <b>Regina v Brown and ors.</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20AC%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 AC 212</a> at
237:
<P>

	"Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence.
Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an
evil thing. Cruelty is
uncivilised."
<P>

25	It is necessary, now, to turn to matters personal and particular to the
prisoner.
<P>

26	The prisoner was born on 28 September 1968. He was aged, thus, about 25-1/2
years at the time of the attack that led ultimately
to the death of the victim.
He is aged now about 30-1/2 years.
<P>

27	The prisoner was married on 16 February 1996. His wife gave evidence in his
case on sentence. I found her a forthright and impressive
witness and I accept
her evidence. I accept that Mrs. Lewis has given her husband as much support as
she can during his current imprisonment;
and I accept that, after his eventual
release back into the general community, she will continue to support him in a
sensible and
practical way such as might reasonably be expected to enhance the
prisoner's prospects of eventual rehabilitation. 
<P>

28	I heard evidence, also, from the prisoner's brother-in-law; and that
evidence, also, I accept. The practical effect of that evidence
can be
summarised, I think, by saying that the prisoner is fortunate enough to have
available to him upon his eventual release, positive
family support that should
be effective to assist him to re-establish himself in the community in some
form of lawful and gainful
employment.
<P>

29	I did not hear evidence from other members of the prisoner's family; but I
noted their presence in Court throughout the proceedings;
and I am satisfied
that, his wife and brother-in-law apart, the prisoner has available to him a
body of family support which strengthens
his prospects of eventual
rehabilitation.
<P>

30	In addition to the foregoing matters, I am satisfied that there are other
indicators of the prisoner's good prospects of future
rehabilitation. The
prisoner presents as an intelligent and reasonably articulate man who has
significant creative, manual skills.
He has not wasted his time in prison, but
has used it to develop, as best he can, those skills. He has been trusted, in
that regard,
to have at his disposal a range of tools, some of which are such
as would certainly not have been made available to him had he been
regarded by
the prison authorities as still liable to outbursts of aggressive violence. In
terms of his own behaviour while in custody,
the prisoner does not appear to
have been a management problem.
<P>

31	There is one qualification to what I see, otherwise, as being the prisoner's
good prospects of future rehabilitation. It concerns
the risk of the prisoner's
resuming his motor cycle club activities and contacts. The prisoner himself
asserts that he has severed
all ties with "The Rebels"; and that he is resolved
to turn his back on that kind of gang culture. His wife, certainly, is
determined
to ensure as best she can that the prisoner does remain hereafter
free of such entanglements. I think, however, that it would be
imprudent not to
keep sensibly in mind that the prisoner has had a long association in the past
with motor cycle clubs; and that
he has been exposed, for much of his young
life, to the influences, frequently anti-social and not infrequently unlawful,
for which
motor cycle clubs are notorious. There is some slight evidence in the
present proceedings to the effect that the prisoner has received
visits from
former motor cycle club associates. I accept, of course, that the mere fact of
those visits does not establish that they
occurred on the initiative of the
prisoner rather than that of the visitors; or that the mere fact of the visits
discredits what
the prisoner himself said in his evidence as to his future
intentions with regard to ongoing motor cycle club contacts. My present
point
is, simply, that the prisoner is not yet completely at arms-length from his
former unwholesome associations; and it would be
wise, I think, for the
relevant custodial authorities to keep an eye on this aspect of the prisoner's
future management. I accept
that the Court itself cannot now do very much about
that matter, except to draw attention to it and to suggest that it is something
that the Serious Offenders Review Council might wish to consider when the
prisoner's minimum term has expired.
<P>

32	The prisoner is entitled, in accordance with well established principles
which need no extensive discussion, to some appropriate
consideration on
account of his plea of guilty. The plea saved a hearing of some six to eight
weeks' likely duration. I have taken
that into account. I have taken account of
the plea, also, in connection with the matter of the prisoner's remorse for his
offence
and its consequences. Remorse is, of course, almost always something
that is extremely difficult to judge rationally and confidently.
I have given
the prisoner some credit for remorse; but it is a sceptical, and therefore
modest, credit.
<P>

33	There remains one matter of particular importance in the case of the present
prisoner. It is the matter of the conditions under
which he will serve any
sentence now passed upon him. 
<P>

34	There is clear evidence, unchallenged and uncontradicted, that the prisoner
has been, while in his present custody, savagely
assaulted by other inmates and
on two separate occasions. One such assault involved an attack by a group of
assailants which resulted
in serious and permanent injuries being inflicted
upon the prisoner's right eye with the bottom of a can with which the eye was
struck
so forcefully as to leave an indentation following the shape of a large
portion of the base of the can. The second assault, also,
was a group assault;
and it involved the deliberate and repeated stabbing of the prisoner in a way
which left him very seriously
wounded, and might very well have caused his
death. The prisoner continues, and will continue, to suffer adverse physical
and emotional
consequences of these incidents.
<P>

35	The background to these assaults is established by the evidence in terms
that are of great concern to this Court. Put shortly,
I am satisfied that the
prisoner's wife has given, in the recent past, evidence that has been
instrumental in bringing to justice
persons guilty of a homicide. The persons
concerned were young offenders and have a particular racial and cultural
identity. I am
satisfied that prison inmates of the same racial and cultural
identity as those young offenders are responsible for the carrying
out of the
assaults of which I have earlier spoken. I am satisfied that it will be, if not
quite literally impossible, at least extremely
difficult, to imprison the
present prisoner in such a way as will ensure that he does not continue to be
at some risk of further
attacks motivated by racial and cultural revenge.
<P>

36	This is not by any means an easy problem for this Court. It is no part of
the proper function of the Court to interfere, or to
attempt to interfere, with
the proper and lawful maintenance of good order and discipline in the prisons
of this State. Responsibility
for those matters of prison administration and
management and security rests with the Corrective Services establishment. By
the same
token, the Court cannot, in my opinion, simply wash its hands of any
concern about intra-mural assaults, of whatsoever kind, committed
by prison
inmates upon one of their number. It is, I think, worth recalling some remarks
of Street CJ, speaking for the Court of
Criminal Appeal, in <b>Regina v George
and Price</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%204%20A%20Crim%20R%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 4 A Crim R 12.</a> The Chief Justice gave express approval to
some observations that had been made on a previous occasion, and by the Court
of Criminal
Appeal, in an unreported decision: <b>Regina v Glasby and
Hines</b>: unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 December 1976. In that
earlier decision, the Court of Criminal Appeal said:
<P>

	"It is necessary to make clear to all inmates of penal institutions that the
perpetration of violence on fellow inmates will be
firmly put down. This is but
one aspect of the whole policy of the law which is aimed at improving the
conditions in prisons and
which is not to be deflected by taking a lenient
approach in circumstances where there has been, as here, so gross an invasion
of
the personal dignity and rights of another prisoner."
<P>

37	It is, of course, the case that in each of the two decisions to which I have
referred, the Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing
with prison inmates who had
been identified, prosecuted to conviction, and sentenced in respect of offences
committed against a fellow
inmate. The assaults committed upon the present
prisoner have not resulted in the identification and proper punishment of the
assailants.
That does not weaken, however, the relevance, or the authority, of
the observations made by the Court of Criminal Appeal; nor does
it lessen, in
my view, the responsibility of this Court to bring to the attention of the
relevant correctional authorities, the past
experiences of the prisoner, as I
have described them, and the imperative need to take urgent and continuing care
to ensure that
every practicable precaution is taken to prevent a recurrence of
these deplorable incidents.
<P>

38	All that said, it must at once be added that this Court cannot treat the
prisoner's experiences in custody, and his reasonable
future apprehensions in
that regard, as simply cancelling out any and every other relevant
consideration, so as to permit of his
being discharged almost immediately from
any continuing imprisonment. The conditions under which the prisoner has
served, and may
well have to serve, his imprisonment must be taken properly
into account; but that accounting must always take place in the proper
context,
which is that the prisoner admits to having been involved in a criminal offence
which resulted in the death of another human
being.
<P>

39	Before coming to an overall assessment of the relevant objective and
subjective matters as I have discussed them, it is necessary
to take account
also of two victim-impact statements that were tendered as part of the Crown
case. The Court is required to receive
such statements, and to acknowledge that
it has so received them. The Court may comment upon the statements if it sees
fit to do
so. The Court is not empowered to take the statements into account
when setting the particular sentence, unless the Court is persuaded
that it
would be appropriate to do so. As to the proposition last stated, I agree with
what was said by Hunt CJ at CL in <b>Regina v Previtera </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R
76</a>; see in particular at 84-87.
<P>

40	I would like, however, to assure the family members who provided the
statements: that I have read them carefully; that I acknowledge
the reality to
them of the grief, pain and sense of loss of which the statements speak; that I
respect the strength of the feelings
which the statements express; and that I
hope very much that it will have given the family members concerned, and will
continue to
give them, at least a measure of comfort and satisfaction to have
had the opportunity of placing before the Court in their own words
all that
they have wished to say to the Court in connection with their sad loss.
<P>

41	It is now necessary to draw together all of the factors, objective and
subjective, that I have previously discussed. I was referred
by both counsel to
a large number of cases, both reported and unreported, which were suggested as
appropriate for consideration in
connection with the present prisoner's
particular case. I was referred, also, to a deal of material in the form of
computer-generated
diagrammatic graphs of what were submitted to be relevant
sentencing patterns.
<P>

42	It is trite that any particular case must be dealt with strictly in
accordance with the demonstrated facts and circumstances
relevant to that case;
and that it will be, at the best, a most unusual circumstance where an earlier
decision will be found that
matches exactly the demonstrated facts and
circumstances of an instant case. There are, however, two decisions among those
that were
cited to me which I have found of particular assistance in my present
task. They are a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered
on 13 July
1993 in the matter of <b>Regina v Brown</b>; and a decision of<b> </b> Graham
Barr J delivered on 3 September 1997 in the matter of <b>Regina v Newman</b>. I
do not suggest that either of those cases is an identical fit with the present
matter; but, as I have said, I think that there
are sufficient similarities to
make those two earlier decisions of some practical present value.
<P>

43	In each of <b>Brown</b> and <b>Newman</b>, an effective head sentence of 9
years was either imposed at first instance or upheld on appeal. I have come to
the conclusion that
such would be an appropriate aggregate sentence in the
present case. On any view of the relevant facts and circumstances, the present
case is, in my opinion, a very serious manslaughter.
<P>

44	It is then necessary to apportion that aggregate sentence between a minimum
term actually to be served; and an additional term
for which the prisoner will
be eligible to be considered for parole. It is not necessary, strictly
speaking, to come to the question
of "special circumstances" as envisaged by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>, unless a contemplated apportionment as
between minimum and additional terms would yield an additional term greater
than one-third
of the minimum term. In the case of the present prisoner, I am
satisfied that there do exist special circumstances of such a character
as
would warrant an apportionment of the aggregate sentence, such as would produce
an additional term greater than one-third of the
minimum term. 
<P>

45	Almost any of the subjective matters to which I have earlier referred would
be capable of constituting such special circumstances;
but there are, in my
opinion, two particular matters proper to be taken into account as special
circumstances.
<P>

46	The first of them is the need to avoid such a sentence as would be likely,
due regard being had to what goes on in the real world
in this respect, to
imperil the prisoner's marriage to his present wife. As I have earlier said, I
thought that Mrs. Lewis was a
forthright and impressive witness. I see it as
being very important to the ultimate rehabilitation of the prisoner that he
have available
to him the encouragement and support of his wife. 
<P>

47	The second matter concerns the question, which I have earlier discussed at
some length, of the proper protection of the prisoner
from further revenge
attacks by fellow inmates. I think that it is important to structure, as best
this can be done in a practical
way, such a sentence as will permit of the
prisoner's being re-classified urgently, and of his transfer to a prison where
there is
the least risk of the prisoner's health and safety being wrongfully
compromised. 
<P>

48	I have come to the conclusion that it would be a just apportionment of the
proposed aggregate sentence to divide it between a
minimum term of 6 years and
an additional term of 3 years. The minimum term will be back-dated so as to
give the prisoner proper
credit for the period of 4 years or thereabouts
already served in full-time custody. The practical result of such an approach
ought
to be that the two particular objectives of which I have latterly spoken
will be possible of practical achievement. 
<P>

49	Scott Tikao Lewis, for the crime of manslaughter of which you have been
convicted, you are sentenced to penal servitude for 9
years. The sentence is
apportioned between a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 3
years. The minimum term will commence
on 8 February 1995 and will expire on 7
February 2001. You will become eligible for parole on 8 February 2001, on and
from which
date the additional term will run. 
<P>

50	The Court recommends that urgent consideration be given to the
reclassification of the prisoner and to the taking of all other
such steps as
will maximise his physical protection, and his necessary medical treatment,
while he continues in custody.
<P>

51	The exhibits may be returned.
