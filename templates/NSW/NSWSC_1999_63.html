<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES </b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>MONDAY, 15 FEBRUARY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>11507/98   -   BERNARD JOHN DUFFY &amp; 2 ORS	</b>
<P>

<b>			KEVIN MICHAEL DUFFY &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Indemnity costs)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff seeks an order that the first defendant pay
their costs on an indemnity basis.  They do not seek this order in respect
of
the first defendant's wife, Sandra Ann Duffy, the second defendant.  The first
defendant was unrepresented at the previous hearing.
 On 28 October 1998 I
delivered judgment and made the following orders:
<P>

2	(1)	The first defendant's defence filed on 24 July 1998 was struck out.
<P>

(2)	Judgment was entered that the plaintiffs be entitled to possession 	of the
land comprised in Lot 2 of Deposited Plan 586210
in the 	Shire of Cabonne
Parish of Borenore and County of Wellington 	and Lots 171 and 184 in Deposited
Plan 756869 in the Shire
of 	Cabonne Parish of Borenore and County of
Wellington.
<P>

(3)	The first defendant was to pay the plaintiff's costs of the notice of
motion filed 21 August 1998.
<P>

(4)	The defendants were to pay the costs of the proceedings.
<P>

(5)	Leave was granted to issue a writ of possession, such writ not to 	issue
before 25 November 1998.
<P>

3	The plaintiffs have sought that their costs be paid on an indemnity basis
because the first defendant's actions were an unnecessary
burden on the estate,
were taken to frustrate the trustees efforts to administer the estate and delay
the beneficiaries receiving
their entitlements.  The plaintiffs submitted that
the law has developed so that an obstructive approach is no longer a
pre-requisite
to an order for indemnity costs and even if the law has not
developed to such an extent the first defendant's actions were obstructive.
<P>

4	The first defendant's solicitor submitted that the first defendant's conduct
had not been unreasonable.  He had made offers of
compromise which included
buying the property and had he not been able to raise the finance within 45
days (later reduced to 30 days),
he would have consented to the issue of a writ
of possession and vacated the property.  In addition, the first defendant has
vacated
the property by the date set out in my earlier judgment.
<P>

5	I turn to give a short history of the relevant matters in relation to costs.

<P>

6	On 20 February 1998, the plaintiffs wrote to the second defendant offering to
issue to the defendants a contract to purchase the
land.  On 17 March 1998, the
plaintiffs agreed to extend the time for exchange to 5.00 pm on that day.  The
defendants did not proceed
to exchange contracts by that date.  The first
plaintiff believed that the defendants were unable to raise the necessary
finance
to proceed with the purchase.
<P>

7	On 8 May 1998, the plaintiffs' solicitor wrote to the first defendant's
solicitors and advised that in relation to the proposal
that the first
defendant purchase 70 acres of the property they had been instructed that their
clients were not prepared to subdivide
the property and that their clients
would not contemplate such action unless they had clear support of all the
beneficiaries but
this was plainly not the case.  The plaintiffs' solicitor
wrote that he was instructed to press for confirmation that the first defendant
would vacate the property by 22 May 1998 and would not take any steps to upset
a sale.
<P>

8	The plaintiffs' agent erected "For Sale" signs outside the property (the
subject of the will and where the first and second defendants
and their
children were residing).  On 22 May 1998, a large sign had been erected on the
fence adjacent to the agents notice which
read "Inspection of the house and
curtilage unavailable".  Each time the agent called to arrange for an
inspection of the residence,
the first defendant informed the agent that it was
not convenient.  Because of the first defendant's actions, the auction was
cancelled.
 By letter dated June 1998, the plaintiffs once again asked the
defendants to vacate the property by 16 Jun 1998 and informed the
first
defendant that they would take legal proceedings including damages.
<P>

9	On 12 August 1998, the first defendant made a further offer (not specified to
be an offer of compromise) to buy the property and
stated that their client
acknowledged that there was no guarantee he would be able to raise the
necessary finances within 30 days
to exchange contracts, however, if this
proposal was accepted by the plaintiffs then the matter would be resolved
within 30 days.
<P>

10	On 1 September 1998, the plaintiffs wrote a letter saying that if a notice
of motion for summary judgment went to a hearing they
would be seeking
indemnity costs.  It should be noted that the first defendant was legally
represented when the offer was made and
when the defence was filed.
<P>

11	A court awarding costs has an "absolute and unfettered" discretion.  The
normal order for costs is that costs follow the event
on a party/party basis
(Part 52A r 11).  There is inherent jurisdiction of the court to award payment
of costs on an indemnity basis
(see s 76 of SCA 1970).  The plaintiff referred
me to <b><u>Rouse v Shepherd (No 2)</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 277</a>;
<b><u>Hurstville Municipal Council v Connor &amp; Anor</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR
724</a> and <b><u>Ettinhausen v Australian Consolidated Press Limited </u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR 404.</a>  
<P>

12	In <b><u>Colgate Palmolive Pty Limited v Cussons</u> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/536.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 536</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2046%20FCR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 46 FCR 225</a>
Sheppard J<b> </b>reviewed the relevant common law principles and said:
<P>

	<b>"In consequence of the settled practice which exists, the court ought not
usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis
other than the
party and party basis.  The circumstances of the case must be such as to
warrant the court in departing from the usual
course."</b>
<P>

13	This passage was cited with approval by <b>Badgery-Parker J</b> in
<b><u>Rouse v Shepherd (No 2)</u></b>.  Sheppard J refers to some of the
circumstances that have warranted departure from the usual course.  They do not
purport to cover
all the circumstances.  The circumstances include where an
allegation of fraud was made when it was known that the allegation was

<P>

false, where an action was continued which had no chance of success or
continued for some other purpose or where there was the wilful
disregard of the
known facts or clearly established law or where a party had been morally or
ethically delinquent.
<P>

14	In <b><u>Connor</u></b>, Loveday J referred to Fountain Selected Meats
(Sales) Pty Limited v International Produce Merchants Pty Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/202.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 202</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2081%20ALR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 81 ALR
397</a> where Woodward J stated:
<P>

	<b>"`...It is appropriate to consider awarding ... `indemnity' costs, whenever
it appears that an action has been commenced or continued
in circumstances
where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he had no chance
of success.  In such cases the action
must be presumed to have been commenced
or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of
the known facts
or the clearly established law.  Such cases are, fortunately,
rare.'</b>
<P>

<b>	In the result he ordered that portion of the costs be paid in that case on
a party and party basis and portion being those costs
incurred after
publication of a High Court decision, on an indemnity basis...'"</b>
<P>

15	Loveday J noted that <b><u>Fountain</u></b> was followed and an order for
indemnity costs made in favour of the plaintiff by Hunt J in <b><u>Blackburn v
State of New South Wales</u></b> (Hunt J, 9 August 1991, unreported) in respect
of a cross claim which the defendant should have known had no chance of
success. 
In that case however the defendant had been warned by the 
<P>

plaintiff that there was no basis for the cross claim and that indemnity costs
would be sought.  Notwithstanding this warning and
notwithstanding views
expressed by Hunt J the defendant had continued to press the cross claim.
<P>

16	Badgery-Parker J in <b><u>Rouse (No2)</u></b> referred to <b><u>Maitland
Hospital v Fisher (No 2)</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20NSWLR%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) NSWLR 723</a> where he referred to the
objects of the rules of court on indemnity costs as being (a)  encourage
savings of private costs and avoidance
of the inherent risks, delays and
uncertainties of litigation;  (b)  to save the public costs which are
necessarily incurred in litigation
which events demonstrate to have been
unnecessary and (c) to indemnify the plaintiff where notionally the real cause
and occasion
of the litigation is the attitude adopted by the defendant.
Indemnity costs can be awarded where a party pursues a case that has
no chance
of success.
<P>

17	Do the circumstances of this case warrant the court in departing from the
usual order that costs be payable on a party/party
basis?  While some sympathy
can be afforded to the first defendant who resided in the family home and was
called upon to sell it,
it is my view that his behaviour in obstructing the
sale of the property and refusing to vacate the property in the circumstances
outlined earlier in this judgment, was unreasonable.  He also was given two
opportunities to buy the property and failed to do so.
 He also received the
benefit of legal advice when proceedings were commenced and he elected to take
an unrealistic stance.  The
plaintiffs are trustees and the delay caused by the
first defendant has meant that the beneficiaries have to wait longer for the
estate to be administered.  Taking these circumstances into account it is my
view that the first defendant should pay the plaintiffs'
costs on an indemnity
basis.
<P>

18	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The first defendant is to pay the plaintiffs' costs on an indemnity 	basis
(including the costs of today).
