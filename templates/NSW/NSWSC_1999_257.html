<b>1746/99	GEORGE THOMAS SHAW v OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT - on application for adjournment
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

1	This matter came before me yesterday.  It is a summons for the extension of a
caveat which will otherwise lapse by reason of the
service of a lapsing notice.
The parties to the proceedings yesterday were the plaintiff, whose interest is
set out in the subject
caveat, being caveat 5505510J, as follows:
<P>

"Nature of the estate or interest in the land/registered dealing
<P>

I am a previous registered proprietor who claims a continuance of 50 per cent
equity in the property, and therefore the right to
veto any transaction
concerning the property (in particular, sale).
<P>

By virtue of the instrument referred to below
<P>

Nature of Instrument:  Caveat
<P>

Date:  14/12/1998
<P>

Parties:  Lily Shaw
<P>

By virtue of the facts stated below
<P>

Restitution of a debt was the basis of claim to the property of the current
registered proprietor, the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy.
 But that debt is
null and void under natural law, &amp; so, there is the proprietorship."
<P>

2	The necessity of extending the caveat arose, as I have said, from the service
of a lapsing notice.  The lapsing notice is in evidence.
 It names the
applicant for the lapsing notice as the Westpac Banking Corporation and there
is no doubt that it was the Westpac Banking
Corporation that, having procured
the lapsing notice, served it upon the caveator.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 74K(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act 1900</a> ("the RPA") provides as follows:
<P>

"(3)  Unless the Supreme Court has made an order dispensing with service it may
not hear an application made under subsection (1)
[to extend operation of a
caveat] unless it is satisfied that all interested parties disclosed by the
notice which gave rise to the
application have been served with copies of the
application before the hearing."
<P>

It is clear from the face of the notice that the Westpac Banking Corporation
falls within the category of "interested parties disclosed
by the notice which
gave rise to the application".  The subsection, by its terms, precludes the
making of an order unless a copy
of the application has been served on those
parties.  In those circumstances I yesterday directed the addition of Westpac
Banking
Corporation as a second defendant to the proceedings and provided for
the summons to be served on it.  The proceedings were adjourned
until this
afternoon. 
<P>

3	This afternoon, Mr Thomas Shaw, the plaintiff's son, who by leave granted by
consent appears on behalf of the plaintiff, applies
for a further adjournment
of the matter and objects to the matter proceeding on the basis that the Court
may not hear the application
to extend the caveat because it will not be
satisfied that all interested parties disclosed by the notice have been served.
He says
that this is so because the Westpac Banking Corporation, as the
applicant for the notice, is described as "being a person entitled
to an estate
or interest in the above land by virtue of Dealing No 5531077".  No further
particular of that dealing is given in the
notice itself.  That dealing is also
in evidence and, if one adverts to that dealing, it is plain that the situation
is that Westpac
Banking Corporation is an incoming mortgagee to facilitate the
purchase of the property by two persons named Fallato, who took the
property
under transfer 5531076 which has also been lodged in the Land Titles Office and
who obviously, on completion of their purchase,
granted mortgage 5531077 to
Westpac Banking Corporation.  In some circumstances, of course, the persons
referred to in a particular
document have been held by the courts to include
persons by reference, being persons who are named not in the document itself
but
in a document to which the first document makes reference.  Bearing in
mind, however, the terms and the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K</a> of the RPA, I am of the view
that the words "all interested parties disclosed by the notice which gave rise
to the application" ought
not be construed in that way.  The words should be
limited to parties who are actually disclosed as having an interest on the face
of the lapsing notice.  The point made on behalf of the plaintiff is not
without logical force, but is deprived of efficacy by the
view which I have
just stated of the correct interpretation of the subsection (and see
<b>Strasburger Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cadomet Pty Ltd</b>, 18 March 1993, NSWSC,
Hodgson J, unreported).
<P>

4	The joinder or service of the Fallatos as purchasers under the transfer is
not, therefore, necessitated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K</a> before the Court can act under the
section.  Of couse, whatever the section provides, general principles require
the joinder of all
intersted parties if their rights may be affected by the
adjudication:  <b>Ryu v Lee</b> (1996) 7 BPR 14,678.  However, I do not, in all
the circumstances of the matter, and, in particular, the clear invalidity of
the
caveat on its face, propose as a matter of discretion to order the joinder
of the Fallatos as parties to the proceedings before I
deal with them.  The
application for an adjournment is, therefore, refused.
