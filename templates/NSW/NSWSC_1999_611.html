<P>

<b>APPLICATION OF NEIL HAROLD PEARSON</b>
<P>

<b>Re:		COSTS</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:	  Following my determination that I had jurisdiction
to entertain the application which was brought under S 474D
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a>, a question arises as to the costs occasioned in relation to the
objections that were raised in that regard.
<P>

2  	The primary objection to jurisdiction was taken by the Australian
Government Solicitor on behalf of the Chief Executive Officer
of Customs
("Customs"), who prosecuted Mr Pearson and Neil Pearson &amp; Company Pty
Limited.  Following the service of notices under
S 78B of the Judiciary Act,
the Attorney General for New South Wales ("The Attorney") intervened.  There
was no other intervention.
 I adopted the course of listing the matter for oral
argument, because of the importance of the issues raised in the written
submissions
received, and its potential application to a range of similar
prosecutions, brought under federal laws and determined, at first instance,
either summarily in Local Courts, or upon indictment in the District Court or
Supreme Court.  
<P>

3  	After handing down my decision, an order for costs in relation to
the preliminary issue was sought by the applicants.
<P>

4  	This application was pressed in reliance upon S 76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act 1970</a>, which relevantly provides:
<P>

"76(1) (a)	Costs shall be in the discretion of the Court,
<P>

	(b)	the Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent
costs are to be paid, and
<P>

		(c)	...
<P>

	(2)	In subsection (1) the expression costs includes:
<P>

 (a)	Costs of or incidental to proceedings in the Court, including the
administration of estates and trusts,
<P>

(b)	in the case of an appeal to the Court, the costs of or incidental to the
proceedings giving rise to the appeal, as well as the
costs of or incidental to
the appeal, and
<P>

		(c) ..."
<P>

5  	It was resisted by Customs which contended that I had no power to
award costs for the reasons that:
<P>

(a)	the application was not a "proceeding" in the Court within the meaning of S
76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>, and that
<P>

(b)	if they were proceedings then the Chief Executive Officer of Customs was
not a "party" to them.
<P>

6  	It is clear from the terms of S 76(1) that the Court has a wide
power to order costs.  Moreover, as noted in my earlier judgment,
the
expression "proceedings" has been given a wide meaning, and includes any step
in an action.  The power to order costs in relation
to preliminary or
interlocutory stages of a proceeding is established:  <u>Parker v Parker</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2016%20Fam%20LR%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 16 Fam LR 458.</a>
<P>

7  	I am of the view that an application under S 474D of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act 1900</a> comfortably fits within the legislative framework that permits costs
orders to be made in relation to proceedings, or to any step
in them.  The
purpose of the application was to have the matter referred to the Court of
Criminal Appeal Act to be dealt with as
an appeal under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act
1912</a>.  The application was in my view properly to be regarded as a proceeding
in the Court, being an "application ... to the Supreme Court"
permitted under
Statute.  Determination of an objection going to my jurisdiction to make such a
referral was, at the least, a matter
incidental to those proceedings.
<P>

8  	This disposes of the first ground of objection.
<P>

9  	I am unable to accept that by the course taken, Customs is not a
party to the proceeding.  Not only was it the prosecuting authority
upon whom,
in accordance with practice, notice was given of the application, but it has
actively intervened not only to contest the
application on jurisdictional
grounds, but also to advance reasons why, on the merits, it should be refused.
It is simply not accurate
to assert, as was done, that the appearance of
Customs was "to assist the Court" on the jurisdictional question.  Its
opposition
was positive as is demonstrated by the submissions in writing that
were provided.  At the least, it submitted to the jurisdiction,
in order to
argue the question of jurisdiction.
<P>

10  	In any event, the jurisdiction to make costs orders under
analogous legislation (S58 of the Supreme Court Act 1867 (Qld)) has
been held
not to be confined to the parties to proceedings:  <u>Knight v FP Special
Assets Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20174%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 174 CLR 178.</a>
<P>

11  	Having failed in its jurisdictional objection, which extended
well beyond the constitutional question, the pressing of which
has occasioned
the applicants in additional costs, I see no reason why an order for costs
should not be made against Customs.
<P>

12  	The Attorney submitted that any costs order made against him
could be made only as provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78a.html" class="autolink_findacts">S78A(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a>.   That
Section is in the following terms:
<P>

"(1)	The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and the Attorney-General of a
State may, on behalf of the State, intervene in proceedings
before the High
Court or any other federal court or any court of a State or Territory, being
proceedings that relate to a <u>matter</u> arising under <u>the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></u> or involving its interpretation.
<P>

(2)	Where the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of a State intervenes in
proceedings in a court under this section, the court
may, in the proceedings,
make such order as to costs against the Commonwealth or the State, as the case
may be, as the court thinks
fit."
<P>

13  	The submissions of the Attorney were limited to the
constitutional question identified in my earlier reasons.  There is no
usual
principle that costs follow the event for constitutional interveners as is
indicated by a series of recent decisions of the
High Court in:
<P>

<u>Egan v Willis</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) HCA 71</a>
<P>

<u>Re East ex party Nguyen</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) HCA 73</a>
<P>

<u>Northern Territory v GPA0</u>	(1999) HCA 8
<P>

<u>Bass &amp; Permanent Trustee Co Ltd</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 9</a>
<P>

<u>Telstra Corporation v Worthing</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 12</a>
<P>

<u>Abebe v The Commonwealth</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) HCA 14</a>
<P>

14  	In <u>O'Toole v Charles David Pty Ltd</u> (1991) 171 CLR 232,
the High Court said at 311:
<P>

"It is only in special circumstances that it is appropriate for the Court to
make an order for costs against an intervener or, at
all events, an order which
would have the result that an intervener pay to one of the parties more than
the amount by which the costs
of that party have been increased by the
intervention.  However, it appears to us that such special circumstances exist
in the present
case.  As has been said, it was the Commonwealth which obtained
the removal of the cause into this Court so that it could intervene
and
challenge the correctness of the answers favouring the respondent.  It has
failed in that challenge."
<P>

The special circumstance there identified is not present here.
<P>

15  	In <u>Leroy v Victoria</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20579" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 579</a> and <u>Lange v
Australia Broadcasting Commission</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 520</a>, costs orders were
made, it would seem, by reference to fact that the submissions made by the
interveners extended the time taken
for the hearing.  Similar considerations,
relating to the additional exposure of the applicant or plaintiff, for costs
attributable
to intervention, appear to rest behind the decision in
<u>Australia Postal Commission v Dao (No.2)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 497</a> to order
costs against interveners.
<P>

16  	In the present case the intervention by the Attorney did not
relevantly extend the hearing, or occasion additional costs to
the applicants.
The constitutional point had already been taken by Customs, and I would regard
the intervention by the Attorney to
have been of assistance in clarifying and
dealing with that issue.
<P>

17  	Accordingly, and in the absence of special circumstances, I
consider it appropriate to follow the more usual practice of not
making an
order against the Attorney.
<P>

18  	The formal order I make is that Customs pay the applicant's
costs of the objection to jurisdiction.
