<b>3827/99	PRIVATE HEALTH GROUP PTY LIMITED (ACN 085 398 116)  v  EPPING
PRIVATE HOSPITAL PTY LIMITED (ACN 068 228 482) &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	During the weekend I granted an ex parte injunction in this
matter up to and including today to prevent the retaking of possession
of
premises (`'the premises'') on which a medical centre business is conducted at
Neutral Bay.  That business was the subject of
one of four interdependent
contracts for sale between the defendants and the plaintiff.  The defendants
claim that one of the four
contracts has been validly terminated by reason of
non-compliance with a notice to complete, that all the contracts are thereby at
an end and that the defendants are therefore entitled to take possession of the
premises.  They, indeed, commenced to take possession
of the premises
physically late on Friday afternoon and continued to do so during Saturday,
which led to the grant of the ex parte
injunction that I have mentioned.
<P>

2   	Mr A S Martin of counsel, who now appears for the
defendants, declares himself ready for a fully contested interlocutory hearing
this afternoon.  Mr Campbell of Queen's Counsel, who now appears with Mr Lo
Surdo for the plaintiff, says that he is not ready for
such a hearing and asks
for the extension of the injunction for a short finite period.  Next Tuesday,
14 September, is suggested
as being a suitable time by which both parties
should be fully ready for a fully contested interlocutory hearing, if that
should
prove necessary.  Mr Martin contends that one contract has clearly been
terminated and that the others are therefore clearly at an
end so that not even
this short period of further relief should be given.
<P>

3   	However, the matter does not appear to me to be so clear.
Various arguments have been raised, including arguments that there
was not
readiness, willingness and ability on the part of the defendants to complete
all four of the interdependent contracts, in
that there had not been compliance
with the terms of the contracts by the vendor at the time the notice to
complete was given and
expired.  Mr Martin says this matters not, because lack
of readiness or breach in relation to the other three contracts did not affect
the defendants' right to terminate the contract for the sale of land, which is
said to be the one in respect of which there was a
clear right of termination.
The situation, therefore has complexities.  I do not think that it is
immediately clear at all that there
was a right to effect a termination which
brought all of the contracts to an end, if there were breach or lack of
readiness to complete
in respect of one or more of them, quite apart from other
aspects of this somewhat complicated matter which may be brought out if
a short
time for preparation is allowed.
<P>

4   	Doubts are raised as to the plaintiff's financial
viability, and this is put as a ground for noncontinuation of the injunction.
I have granted the defendants leave to file in Court today a notice of motion
seeking security for any undertaking as to damages
that is accepted by the
Court and also security for costs.  I should put on public record that, when
obtaining the ex parte injunction
during the weekend, counsel properly and
frankly told me that the plaintiff did not immediately have available finance
to complete
the contracts.  It does not, of course, necessarily follow from
that that the plaintiff is impecunious.
<P>

5   	The question of the balance of convenience obviously
arises.  Just as the plaintiff is at present conducting the premises as
a
medical centre, the defendants or one of them did so prior to the plaintiff
being let into possession under the relevant contract
for sale, and that
defendant would seek again to conduct upon the premises a medical centre if it
regained possession.  I think,
bearing in mind the shortness of the adjournment
that I propose to grant with covering injunctive relief, that what would be
most
highly inconvenient would be for possession of this centre to shift more
often than necessary between the contesting bodies of doctors
who seek
possession of it.  In those circumstances, I think that the best course is,
against a continuing undertaking as to damages
given on the plaintiff's part,
to continue the existing injunction up to and including Tuesday, 14 September
1999.
<P>

6   	I make the following orders.
<P>

(1)	I adjourn both the principal proceedings and the notice of motion which has
been filed today to 14 September 1999 at 9.30 am
before the Registrar.  
<P>

(2)	Upon the plaintiff by its counsel giving to the Court the usual undertaking
as to damages I continue up to and including 14
September 1999 the existing
injunction.  
<P>

(3)	I reserve the costs of today.
<P>

(4)	I direct that the plaintiff on or before 10 September 1999 file and serve
any affidavits on which it intends to rely. 
<P>

(5)	I direct that the defendants file any further affidavits on which they
intend to rely on or before 10 September 1999 and any
affidavits in answer to
the plaintiff's material on or before 13 September 1999.  
<P>

(6)	I appoint Thursday, 9 September 1999 for the return of subpoenas or notices
to produce such subpoenas or notices to be served
by noon on 8 September
1999.
<P>
