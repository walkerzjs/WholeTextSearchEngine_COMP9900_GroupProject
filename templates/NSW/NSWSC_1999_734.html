MENNEGA v LANE COVE FITNESS CENTRE
<P>

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	The plaintiff, John Martin Mennega, brought this action against
the first, second and third defendants,  in respect of injuries
the plaintiff
sustained whilst operating gymnasium equipment at the fitness centre operated
by first defendant. Breach of duty of
care was admitted by the first and second
defendants.
<P>

2  	The first and second defendants as cross-claimants commenced an
action against the third defendant as cross-defendant in contract
and tort,
seeking indemnity. That cross-claim was stood over by me at the commencement of
the hearing and was not the subject of
these proceedings.   
<P>

3  	The plaintiff claims damages for the injuries and his loss of
earning capacity. The first and second defendants conceded that
the plaintiff
suffered the injuries and that he had suffered damage as a result of the
injuries sustained.  However, the extent of
damages was at issue.
<P>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

4  	At about 6.30 pm on 6 January 1995 the plaintiff, during the
course of his exercise session at the fitness centre, was operating
a piece of
equipment, known as a "Hi-Lo pulley weight training Machine ("Hi-Lo Machine"),
by pulling down a handle which caused a
weight in the equipment to rise via a
cable and pulley. As the plaintiff was using the equipment the Hi-Lo Machine
came away from
the floor and fell on top of the plaintiff, causing severe
injury to the plaintiff's back, head and shoulders.
<P>

5  	At the time the machine came away from the floor the plaintiff,
who was standing in front facing the machine, was moving about
80 to 100 kg in
weight. The plaintiff described the accident as being very sudden and of the
two big bars on the outside of the machine
catching his shoulder and squashing
him to the ground. The two thin bars which the individual weights move up and
down, hit the plaintiff
on the head. The plaintiff was not rendered unconscious
but was unable to move, obliging other people in the gymnasium to have to
 lift
the machine off him in order that he could be freed.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff, who was in severe pain from the lower back injury
as well as the injuries to his right shoulder and collar bone,
was taken to
Royal North Shore Hospital and admitted to the orthopaedic ward where he
remained for some 13 days until discharge on
19 January 1995. The plaintiff
then returned home where he was looked after by his wife, being unable to
routinely look after himself.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Background</b>
<P>

7  	The plaintiff, who was born in Holland, is now about 52 years
old. He is married with a daughter, aged nine years, and currently
resides at
Lane Cove, although not with his wife. He is an Australian citizen, having
migrated with his family in 1952 at the age
of four. The plaintiff is currently
employed as Head of Client Services for IPAC Portfolio Management. 
<P>

8  	The relationship between the plaintiff and his wife has not
however  been without its problems, and in fact at one stage around
1993 the
plaintiff moved out of the matrimonial home and lived for a period of three
days a week at an apartment in the city close
to the gym where he used to
train. 
<P>

9  	The plaintiff attended Kempsey High School, passing the Leaving
Certificate in the mid 60s and then attended the University
of NSW where he
graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in 1971. The plaintiff thereafter
completed a post graduate Diploma in Industrial
Engineering, an MBA from the
University of NSW and a Diploma in Investment and Financial Management from the
Securities Institute
of Australia.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff has spent most of his life working in the
financial field. His first graduate employment was as a professional
engineer
at Overseas Telecommunications, where he worked from January 1972 to March
1975. From March 1975, whilst doing his MBA,
the plaintiff worked for Citibank,
initially as Operations Manager and then as Credit Control Manager. As Credit
Control Manager
the plaintiff had responsibility for introducing mechanisms
into Australia such as credit scoring and other methodologies for managing
consumer credit. 
<P>

11  	The plaintiff worked at Citibank for some four years, leaving in
August 1979 to commence employment with Morrow Australia,
initially to develop
the superannuation business of the company and then as  Director of Marketing.
The plaintiff's job involved
promoting the company's ability to manage funds,
fiducially as well as for investment purposes. After working at Morrow for some
time the plaintiff decided that he wanted to work in a business where he had a
propriety interest and to that end he, along with
a number of other persons,
established a company called Eastcorp Pty Limited. Eastcorp was primarily
involved in managing the financial
investments and superannuation of clients.
Eastcorp was also involved in providing life and business insurance and finance
broking.
The company grew in its early years employing 45 people and having
around 200 licensed dealer representatives, and in May 1984 the
plaintiff
became Managing Director of Eastcorp Pty Ltd. 
<P>

12  	Eastcorp Pty Limited was appointed by the Australian Investment
Planners Association to be the company which was to provide
the educational
resources for persons wishing to obtain dealer representative licences. The
plaintiff consequently began to lecture
those seeking to acquire those
qualifications and the plaintiff became a principal lecturer at the Securities
Institute. In addition
to teaching the course the plaintiff also wrote some of
the materials. The plaintiff during this period was also involved in the
management of a business that his wife operated, called the Pine Street
Kindergarten.
<P>

13  	The plaintiff was Managing Director of Eastcorp throughout the
80s until about 1989 when the company ceased to operate due
to difficulties,
including the October 1987 stock market crash. Once the company ceased to
operate, part of its activities were transferred
to another company called
Monitor Money, a subsidiary of Lendlease. 
<P>

14  	In about June 1989 the plaintiff commenced employment with
Monitor Money on a consultancy basis on a base salary of $150,000.00.
The
plaintiff stayed at Monitor Money for about two years until he was head-hunted
to commence employment with AMP Investments Australia
as the Head of Wholesale
and Head of Retail. The plaintiff was paid a base salary of $170,000.00 and
received a range of other incentives
such as a significant bonus potential,
superannuation, complementary carparking, life and accident insurance, health
benefits as
well as other small ancillary benefits. The plaintiff was employed
at AMP from April 1989 to October 1994. He was made redundant
approximately
three months before the accident.
<P>

15  	During the time the plaintiff was at AMP his role had expanded
to include a greater responsibility for product design and input
and he became
responsible for full support of AMP Australia. Prior to being retrenched from
AMP the plaintiff received a bonus in
July of $31,450.00 on a base salary of
$198,000.00, totalling about $230,000.00. In addition to that amount the
plaintiff also received
non-cash benefits by way of superannuation of about
$25,000.00, as well as carparking, discounts on insurance and medical benefits.

<P>

16  	In the period before being retrenched the plaintiff had been
involved in product design and manufacture, requiring him to provide
investment
details to enable products to be appropriately positioned and costed.  He had
about thirty five employees under his supervision
and control. However, with
the restructuring of the organisation this job was no longer required. On
redundancy the plaintiff was
paid a further amount of $59,228.00 called an
eligible termination payment. 
<P>

17  	Between leaving AMP in October 1994 and the accident on 6
January 1995 the plaintiff had been speaking to a number of search
agencies,
but was advised to leave his C.V. with them until January because it was a
quiet time of the year and there was nothing
much happening. The plaintiff had
written to about a half a dozen firms aside from engaging the help of a
recruitment agent, and
was seeking a position with a package of about
$250,000.00. Had the accident not occurred the plaintiff was of the opinion
that he
would have had quite an good opportunity of finding work. 
<P>

18  	On 21 August 1995 the plaintiff did return to work obtaining a
short term position as Head of Business Services at the Colonial
State Bank, an
appointment that was Sydney based. He commenced on a salary of about
$180,000.00 which included bonuses, superannuation
and insurance perks. Soon
after his appointment the plaintiff was promoted and had an increase in salary
of $30,000.00. In August
1996 the plaintiff was paid a bonus of $15,000.00. The
plaintiff remained with the State Bank until December 1996 when the position
he
held ceased to exist due to a restructuring. 
<P>

19  	After retrenchment by the Colonial State Bank the plaintiff by
chance renewed his association with Mr Morrow, joining his operation
in May
1997 as a consultant. He was not paid a fee until about August when he was paid
a monthly consulting fee of $6,250.00, an
amount considerably less than his
prior earnings. The plaintiff consulted for Mr Morrow until November 1997,
obtaining employment
thereafter with IPAC Financial Services Limited ("IPAC"),
a financial services organisation that provides financial advice and money
management services.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff now has been working for IPAC in Sydney since 1
December 1997 for part of the company known as IPAC Portfolio
Management, where
he is responsible for the company's large institutional and corporate clients.
The plaintiff is also chairman of
the company's management committee, and a
member of the corporate HR committee. 
<P>

21  	The plaintiff's salary when he first commenced employment with
IPAC was $165,000.00 which was increased to $180,000.00 from
1 July 1998. The
plaintiff has in addition been paid the amount of $31,759.00 by way of bonus.

<P>

22  	Prior to the accident the plaintiff's work had required him
travel both locally and interstate. His evidence was that whilst
working at AMP
over a period of 4 years he went on one overseas trip and about 30 to 40
percent of his time was spent travelling
interstate.
<P>

23  	Since the accident however the plaintiff has found such travel
difficult, and has chosen to pursue employment where there is
little or no
requirement to travel. The plaintiff says that he has a lot of difficulty
sitting and standing in an upright position,
including travelling in the car
and on planes, causing him to have to take medication to deal with the pain.

<P>

24  	The plaintiff gave further evidence that such back pain also
affects his concentration and often finds the need to get up and
walk around or
leave a business meeting if the pain becomes too intense. Over the last couple
of months the plaintiff has had to
take off approximately one day a month
because of the pain. 
<P>

25  	The plaintiff gave evidence that he has also had other
restrictions since the accident, such as trouble with carrying his daughter,
or
carrying anything heavy. 
<P>

26  	At the time of the accident the plaintiff was a very fitness
conscious individual. He exercised at the gymnasium five or six
times a week
and swam, cycled, ran or rowed for 45 minutes a day every day. His evidence was
that he had always loved exercising
and sport and believed that it was
important to be healthy. 
<P>

27  	The plaintiff has now had to modify these activities. He now
does exercise to minimise the effect of the back injury. The plaintiff,
since
the accident, has been able to get back to doing some walking, although he has
not been able to jog. He has been doing some
swimming, although he can only now
swim for a shortened period. An attempt to cycle  caused him pain. 
<P>

28  	The plaintiff had also attempted to go skiing on a number of
occasions, a sport in which he was once an expert, but found it
difficult. In
1996 he took the family down to Thredbo for three days but was unable to ski
because it hurt too much when he tried
to put the skis on. In 1997 he went down
again to Thredbo after purchasing a new set of skis but told the Court he still
had the
same problems. His evidence was that on the first day he could only ski
for about three hours and on the second day he could only
ski for about an hour
in the morning.
<P>

29  	As to exercising at the gymnasium his evidence was that he does
regular stretching exercises and will use the gymnasium sporadically.
He is
unable to lift the amount of weights he once used to prior to the accident. He
has not resumed rowing either on the gym machine
or on the water, an activity
he once used to do regularly, since the accident. He is currently a member of a
gymnasium located in
close proximity to his work.
<P>

30  	The plaintiff has had chondromalacia patellae of both the right
and left knees for eleven years. He has not had any serious
operation. The
plaintiff has no known allergies, took no medication, did not smoke and only
occasionally took alcohol.  
<P>

<b>The injuries</b>
<P>

31  	On his admission to the Royal North Shore Hospital the plaintiff
came under the care of Dr Stephen Ruff, Orthopaedic Surgeon.
X-rays taken of
the plaintiff's back and shoulder on the day of the accident revealed a
compression fracture of two lumbar vertebrae
and injury to the rotator cuff,
trapezius and rhomboid.  The plaintiff had also sustained an abrasion to his
forehead, a blow to
the right side of his jaw and injury to his ribs. The
plaintiff was treated with pethadine injections for nearly a week and was
sedated
for the pain. The plaintiff was unable to drink liquids for four days
and was on a drip for five days after his admission. 
<P>

32  	The plaintiff initially required physiotherapy and the use of a
standing frame. Toward the end of his stay the plaintiff was
able to move
around by using a walking frame and was subsequently fitted with a talus brace,
that is a brace which goes over his
shoulders and around his lumbar region. 
<P>

33  	On discharge the plaintiff, although mobile, was required to
continue to wear the talus brace, and was on bed rest at home
resting for
approximately 22 hours per day. He was, after some time, gradually able to walk
within the confines of his home, although
initially with great difficulty. The
plaintiff was confined to his house for about one month. 
<P>

34  	The plaintiff's wife gave evidence that for the first few months
until the brace came off, he heavily relied on her helping
him get out of bed,
get dressed, go down to the kitchen and prepare breakfast, and shower and dress
him. This routine would commence
at 8.00 am and continue until about 10.00 when
he would lie on the floor for the rest of the day and watch videos. She would
also
prepare his lunch and dinner and assist him with going to the bathroom. In
addition to this routine she would also take him to medical
appointments, and
estimated that she was spending about 38 hours a week looking after him. By the
time the plaintiff had resumed
employment in August 1995, the plaintiff's wife
was spending about two hours a week caring for him.  
<P>

35  	By mid-February the plaintiff had gradually begun to increase
his activities but continued to wear the brace for some three
and a half months
thereafter. The plaintiff was also supported with medication for pain relief
and attended physiotherapy as an outpatient
at the hospital. After discharge as
an outpatient the plaintiff attended physiotherapy at the Hunters Hill
Physiotherapy &amp; Rehabilitation
Centre where he was treated by Helen Care.

<P>

36  	When the plaintiff was first assessed by Helen Care on 22 May
1995 the plaintiff, who complained of lack of lumbar mobility,
difficulty in
changing positions and pain following periods of sitting, appeared to be
experiencing significant limitation of lumbar
extension and right side flexion.
He was given a home program of mobility exercises, Ms Care opining that manual
therapy was inappropriate
at that point. 
<P>

37  	On 5 July 1995 the plaintiff, who continued to complain of
considerable pain at the site of his injury, in particular when
sitting or
driving for a prolonged period, was examined by his G.P., Dr Timothy David.  Dr
David in his report of 10 July 1995 opined
that there was clearly an ongoing
need for treatment for the injuries, and that such treatment should be in the
form of physiotherapy
and pain relief medication. Dr David was unable to give a
prognosis of the future effect of the plaintiff's injuries.
<P>

38  	On 24 November 1995 the plaintiff was examined by a Consultant
Surgeon, Dr David Wilcox, who observed the plaintiff to have
discomfort when
sitting and rising, and found on examination pronounced knuckle kyphosis at L1
and tenderness over L1 and L4, as
well as a flattened lumbar lordotic curve of
the thoraco lumbar spine. Dr Wilcox was of the view that surgery was not a
viable option
at this stage and that the plaintiff should continue attending
physiotherapy. According to Dr Wilcox, although the pain will never
completely
subside the plaintiff should find that the activities he undertakes will become
less uncomfortable over the next 2 to
3 years. 
<P>

39  	On 5 March 1996, some thirteen months after the accident, the
plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Ruff continuing to complain of back
pain,
hamstring tightness and right shoulder pain. Examination of the plaintiff
revealed some tenderness in the axial skeleton and
marked retro-patellar
tenderness in the left knee. The plaintiff had a full range of motion at his
shoulders and his peripheral perfusion
was normal. According to Dr Ruff,
although the plaintiff had made some further improvement, his progress remained
only satisfactory.
Dr Ruff anticipated a gradual return to full function with
minimal long term disability.
<P>

40  	On 28 January 1997 the plaintiff was examined by Dr Stephen
Buckley, Consultant in Rehabilitation Medicine, at the request
of his
solicitors. Dr Buckley's examination revealed that the compression fractures of
the two lumbar vertebra(L1 and L4) though
fully healed, caused the plaintiff
minor mechanical disadvantage and back pain. Dr Buckley opined that the
plaintiff should undergo
six physiotherapy treatments every second year for the
management of back pain, and should consult an orthopaedic surgeon once every
five years for the management of any severe exacerbations. Dr Buckley
considered the plaintiff fit to work in the financial industry
without any
restriction, although an addition of one week of sick leave may be required
every second year to take account of exacerbations
of back pain.
<P>

41  	On 8 May 1997 the plaintiff, continuing to complain of pain in
his back, right shoulder and in his knees, was examined by Dr
Scougall,
Orthopaedic Surgeon. Dr Scougall's examination of the plaintiff revealed
restricted back movement and some tenderness over
all spinous processes from
the lower thoracic area to the sacrum.  As to the plaintiff's prognosis Dr
Scougall found in May 1997:
<P>

"He has significant impairment of function from his back injury and that
impairment is now permanent. He will always have back pain,
as outlined in my
report, causing him disability. This will permanently limit his work and
recreational activities and his ability
to maintain his house. His back pain is
always aggravated by travel in cars and aeroplanes, and the pain so caused, not
only limits
his ability to be involved in travel, but disturbs his
concentration at the meetings that he is required to go to. It is to his credit
and a tribute to his work ethic, that he has been able to go to work, in spite
of the very significant disability that he has."
<P>

42  	Dr Scougall commented further in a letter of 20 June 1997, in
respect of the likelihood of any form of degenerative changes
occurring, that
although the plaintiff's right shoulder and knee will not be prone to any such
degenerative changes, the plaintiff's
spine will be prone to increased
degenerative changes. Dr Scougall opined that the plaintiff will experience
difficulties in coping
with activities such as bending and lifting, and
travelling in cars and aeroplanes, and that the increasing back disability will
pose increasing problems with his ability to work.
<P>

43  	When Dr Buckley reviewed the plaintiff on 6 January 1998 he had
found little change in the plaintiff's condition from that
of the previous
twelve months. Examination of the plaintiff revealed prominent posterior
vertebral process at the upper lumbar level,
which was tender, and lateral
rotation causing pain. Dr Buckley opined that the plaintiff was markedly
limited in his ability to
travel either by car or by aeroplane and that his
work prospects are altered negatively by his fractures. 
<P>

44  	Dr Scougall also came to the same conclusion, that there had
been no fundamental change in the plaintiff's underlying condition,
when he
examined the plaintiff on 6 July 1998. As to the plaintiff's prognosis Dr
Scougall opined that the plaintiff's present symptoms
and disabilities remained
as outlined in his report of 20 June 1997, being that the plaintiff will
experience difficulties in coping
with various activities, including travel,
and that his back problems are likely to cause him difficulties with his
working ability.
<P>

45  	The plaintiff continues to experience sensitivity at the site of
the L1 and L4 fracture and has ongoing pain, weakness and
restriction of
movement throughout his lumbar spine. The plaintiff is unable to bend, lift and
carry without distress, and is unable
to sit, stand or walk for protracted
periods without discomfort. As a result of the pain and discomfort the
plaintiff said that he
experiences feelings of hopelessness.
<P>

46  	Dr. Bodel, Orthopaedic Surgeon, after examining the plaintiff,
found that the plaintiff had been able to return to daily workouts,
but had not
been able to return to his pre-injury level of condition.  He was of the view
that the plaintiff's condition had stabilised,
but he had ongoing pain, and
therefore the plaintiff's ability to lead a normal life had been quite
compromised.    Surgery was not
indicated.  Dr. Bodel opined that the plaintiff
would require analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication to optimise his back
function,
and that he should continue with his exercise program.  
<P>

47  	On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that he as a result
of the accident suffers from a significant pain disorder associated
with
psychological symptoms as well as insomnia, depression and anxiety. It is also
claimed that the plaintiff's ability to participate
in pre-accident work has
decreased, as have his social, sexual, domestic and recreational activities.

<P>

48  	The plaintiff was psychologically examined by Dr. David Isaacs,
a medical practitioner qualified in examining depression and
other psychiatric
conditions, who found that the plaintiff had suffered a reactive depression in
the form of a modified grief reaction
as a result of the accident.  This
depression was aggravated by existing life stresses.  He was of the opinion
that the depression
would resolve spontaneously without residual disability,
but that that resolution could be accelerated by counselling and stress
management techniques.
<P>

49  	Malcolm Dent, Consultant Psychiatrist, also examined him in
August 1995, shortly after his return to employment.  He found
that the
plaintiff suffered considerable pain from his disabilities but found no
evidence of a post traumatic stress disorder, but
that he has associated
psychological symptoms as a consequence of the significant pain disorder from
which he suffers, related to
the physical injury that he sustained.  This has
resulted in an adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features, and some
social
and working inhibition.  In a later report on 28 January 1998 Dr. Dent
adhered to that diagnosis, noting that the plaintiff continued
to suffer from
symptoms of chronic pain disorder, and expressed the view that treatment for
pain is now available, such as through
multidisciplinary pain management,
particularly at Royal North Shore Hospital, to relieve the effect of that
disorder.
<P>

50  	On behalf of the defendant Dr. William Rowe, a medico-legal
consultant, examined the plaintiff and was of the view that the
plaintiff did
not have any psychiatric condition, and that he had had a number of problems
before the accident that he could cope
with, without outside help.  He found
that the plaintiff had improved considerably since obtaining his present job,
and was of the
view that it was the underlying organic damage to the
plaintiff's back which was causing any problems which he now suffered.
<P>

51  	There is not a large degree of difference between the various
medical experts.  I accept the evidence of Dr. Ruff and Dr. Wilcox
and Dr.
Scougall as to the plaintiff's medical condition, and I accept Dr. Stephen
Buckley as to not only his medical conclusion
but the need for physiotherapy
treatment.  I also accept Dr. Isaacs and Dr. Dent in their assessment of his
mental condition.  That
is not to say that that is necessarily in conflict with
Dr. William Rowe, but I prefer the evidence of Doctors Dent and Isaacs. 

<P>

52  	The plaintiff suffered a very painful and shocking physical
injury as a result of the negligence of the first and second defendants,
he
then being an extremely fit, healthy and agile man of his years.  The  pain
that he suffered, both in the bruising of his ribs,
the necessity to get around
with and without a back brace, the loss of  sleep, and the pain that he
suffered in the initial weeks
in terms of jolting and movement in car trips,
were extremely painful.  The laceration to the head resolved itself fairly
promptly,
and the right shoulder took a few more weeks to settle down, and
continued to be painful to a lesser extent over a period of eight
or nine
months.   The bruising to his ribs resolved within four or five weeks, leaving
the problem of the injury to his back as an
ongoing problem.
<P>

53  	The plaintiff's disabilities prevented him carrying out his
normal life activities, and he required considerable assistance,
during
considerable pain,  to perform elementary things such as getting up from the
floor and getting down to the floor, where he
spent much of his time during the
rehabilitation period.  It took until August of 1995 for him to be fully
independent in terms of
getting up and down, and other movements.  He has been
restricted from the pleasure of mowing his lawn, and carrying his daughter
up
the stairs, and moving objects around his house, it being a four-storey
townhouse.  The injury to his lumbar spine is an ongoing
and painful process,
requiring medication to reduce that pain.
<P>

54  	The plaintiff was for a long time prevented from carrying around
his young daughter, and was restricted in carrying out play
and other
activities with her, and was unable to do the shopping.
<P>

55  	The plaintiff has made a remarkable recovery, particularly
because of his fitness program, and his continuation with a fitness
program
will allow him to continue a higher degree of fitness than another person less
motivated to improve and maintain his physical
fitness.  I do consider that the
plaintiff was such as would have kept his physical fitness and fitness program
in any event.
<P>

56  	The plaintiff now suffers recurring pain in the lumbar region,
particularly preventing him from sitting and driving for long
periods, and in
aeroplane travel, and is now considerably restricted in his sporting
activities.
<P>

57  	The plaintiff has made, particularly because of his physical
fitness and his continuation with a fitness program, a remarkable
recovery from
his injuries.  
<P>

58  	Pain is fairly difficult to assess, even with medical
practitioners assessing complaints as to pain, since there is a tendency
for an
assessing doctor to have to accept the truthfulness of the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff is believed by most of those doctors
who have assessed him, and
clearly he has made a genuine attempt to regain his fitness, which is to his
credit.  However, the plaintiff
and his wife have both somewhat exaggerated the
number of hours of assistance given to the plaintiff after the initial period.
I
will deal with this under the heading below dealing with gratuitous domestic
assistance.  I do however accept generally that the
plaintiff has been
truthful, and that he in fact is suffering, from time to time, considerable
pain which requires management.  
<P>

59  	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the claim is
worth some $120,000, and on behalf of the first and second defendants
that the
claim is worth between $60,000 and $80,000.  I think that the extent of
restriction of life style and physical fitness enjoyment
and capacity to carry
out the plaintiff's work has been significantly impaired.  This is very
difficult for a person who has gone
to more trouble than most of the community
in keeping fit.  I also have taken into account that although I do not think
the plaintiff
has clinical depression, the plaintiff does have an adjustment
disorder with some mixed emotional features, and some social and work
inhibition.  This has made it, and will make it, more difficult for him to cope
with the process of ageing, and a marriage which
had, prior to the injuries, a
shaky and difficult past.  The plaintiff's sex life, both in past and present,
is significantly impaired.
<P>

60  	I consider that the extent of the existing pain and suffering
and loss of amenity of life, and the likely future loss, is of
some magnitude,
considerably more than that contended by the first and second defendants, and I
assess the plaintiff's general damages
at $110,000, and I allow that figure.
<P>

<b>Interest on Damages</b>
<P>

61  	I consider that the plaintiff is entitled to the interest on
those general damages, and that a proper basis for assessing the
shorter period
of greater pain and discomfort in the past, as against the longer period of the
likely future, considerably less pain
and discomfort,  that it is proper to
attribute 50% to the past accruing evenly, and 50% to the future.  I
accordingly assess interest
on damages at $55,000 times 4% per annum, times 50%
times four and a half years, making the sum of $4,950.00, which I allow.
<P>

<b>Out of Pocket Expenses</b>
<P>

62  	The parties have agreed on calculation and entitlement at
$4,330.00, which sum I allow, reserving to the parties to add to
this figure
any further sum which may have been incurred.
<P>

<b>Past Gratuitous Domestic Assistance</b>
<P>

63  	The first and second defendants concede the need for domestic
care from the time of the plaintiff's release from hospital until
August 1995.
As I previously indicated, I do not consider that the number of hours contended
is a proper reflection of the time spent
by the plaintiff's wife.  I believe
both the plaintiff and the plaintiff's wife have exaggerated to the extent that
much of the duties
contended would be in fairly short time frames.  However,
the extent of the claim is not disputed until 1 August 1995, and I therefore
allow the claim from 19 January 1995 to 6 April 1995 at $6,270.00;  for the
period from 8 April 1995 to 1 July 1995 at $5,400.00,
and the sum of $1,500.00
for the period from 2 July 1995 to 1 August 1995.  I do not consider that the
extent of the domestic assistance
claimed from that time until the time of the
hearing is two hours per week, but that assistance would be needed generally of
some
two hours per fortnight for heavier cleaning and lifting, and I therefore
allow 198 weeks at one hour per week, and I allow the sum
of $2,970.00 to date
of hearing.  The total past claim is therefore $16,140.
<P>

<b>Future Domestic Assistance</b>
<P>

64  	I consider that the plaintiff will have an ongoing need for
domestic assistance for heavier cleaning and housework of the order
of two
hours per fortnight, and I therefore allow one hour per week at a multiplier of
970.6 less 15% for vicissitudes, and I therefore
allow the sum of
$14,559.00.
<P>

<b>Physiotherapy</b>
<P>

65  	I accept the uncontested evidence of Dr. Buckley that the
plaintiff will need six treatments bi-annually at $55.00 and thereafter
at
$45.00, and I calculate this at the multiplier of 970.6 less 15% vicissitudes
at $2,530.00, which I allow.
<P>

<b>Future Medical Care</b>
<P>

I accept the evidence of Dr. Stephen Buckley as to need and cost of a general
practitioner and orthopaedic surgeon, which on the
appropriate multiplier less
a discount for vicissitudes, I allow at $750.00.
<P>

<b>Pain Management</b>
<P>

66  	Based on the evidence of Dr. Dent, and accepting the nature of
the plaintiff, I consider that it is likely that the plaintiff
will not avail
himself of the full psychological pain management treatment, but will have a
need for some part of that treatment,
and I therefore allow the sum of $4,
000.00.
<P>

<b>Gymnasium Expenses</b>
<P>

67  	I consider that the plaintiff's lifestyle is such that he would
in any event have continued his gymnasium expenses for the
likely period that
he would need them post-accident, therefore I do not allow any sum for this.
<P>

<b>Future Sundry Expenses</b>
<P>

68  	The claim to cover future medications, back braces, supports and
increased premiums is claimed at $5,000.00.  In my view this
is a proper
assessment of likely needs, and I therefore allow the sum of $5,000.00.
<P>

<b>Past Wage Loss Superannuation</b>
<P>

69  	I have left till last this most difficult area of these
proceedings.  As submitted by the first and second defendants, the
plaintiff
did not call specific evidence from the various recruitment agencies who might
have given evidence as to the available
market, and an assessment of the
plaintiff's worth.  The wage that the plaintiff was earning prior to his
retrenchment is some evidence
of his worth, but the onus is on the plaintiff to
show the continuation of that worth, since prima facie the wage that a person
earns
may not necessarily be what he is worth; it is merely evidence of it.
<P>

70  	I do consider that the plaintiff would have gained employment
prior to his employment with the State Bank, although I do not
think, in the
fairly leisurely way in which the plaintiff was proceeding towards that
employment, at what is conceded to be a quiet
time of the year, that he would
necessarily have commenced employment by 1st March, but consider that 1st April
would be a more appropriate
starting date.
<P>

71  	I consider that the plaintiff's history of employment since the
accident was not entirely referable to that accident, and underlines
the
fragile nature of the plaintiff's industry in terms of the certainty of
continuous employment at a precise wage.  
<P>

72  	I accept the plaintiff's submission in relying on Medlin v. SGIO
(1995) 182 CLR1:
<P>

"A plaintiff is to be compensated not for loss of wages, but for the loss of an
asset, namely a capacity to earn income."
<P>

73  	I accept the submission on behalf of the plaintiff that there
has been a diminution in earning capacity, as a first step, and
that that
diminution is productive of financial loss.  
<P>

74  	I also accept that the plaintiff's ongoing physical restrictions
impair his capacity to attend lengthy meetings and sitting
for lengthy periods,
and the difficulties that will come from the need to visit people on a face to
face basis, and oblige him to
travel considerable distances.  There is in my
view an impaired capacity to bring in business.
<P>

75  	I also accept the submission of the plaintiff that precise
quantification of loss of earning capacity is difficult, and that
precision is
not possible.
<P>

76  	The plaintiff's calculations, which are agreed as to mathematics
only as to past wage loss, are based on a loss of $247,000
earning capacity,
less $150,000 gross capacity, multiplied by 51.5%.  The plaintiff's
calculations come to $210,315, to which I add
a further $8,000 from date of
hearing to judgment, making in all a figure which I round up to $218.000.  
<P>

77  	I consider that a proper figure for the plaintiff's earning
capacity, based on the examination of the evidence and his actual
work history,
and taking into account the salary from which he was retrenched, that a proper
earning capacity is the sum of $220,000,
and that that should commence from the
1st April 1995.  I accept the mathematics of the amounts to be deducted from
that gross salary,
and dorect the parties to carry out the calculations
thereon.  I consider that the submission of the plaintiff as to interest on
past wage loss on which calculation has been agreed, is a correct basis for the
calculation of interest, and I direct the parties
to submit calculations as to
the amounts to be allowed, that is accepting the calculations except for the
gross figure.
<P>

78  	  I consider that the period of employment with Mr. Morrow is
part of the evidence I have taken into account in assessing the
plaintiff's
capacity to earn income.
<P>

<b>Future Wage Loss Superannuation</b>
<P>

79  	For reasons I have outlined, I consider that the plaintiff has
an income earning capacity which is a reduction on his former
pre-accident
earning capacity.  The restrictions in his movements through pain and
difficulty in travel will inevitably result in
a reduction in income earning
capacity, and consequent superannuation.  It is very difficult, with such a
very high income in a market
where the plaintiff is handling amounts of money
in the nature of telephone numbers, to precisely calculate the loss.  His
inability
to travel as much will reduce his value as an employee, and reduce
his earning capacity.
<P>

80  	I do however consider that there is a clear loss of income and
superannuation entitlements, which I calculate at $30,000.00
per annum, which
when multiplied by 51.3% by the multiplier to age of retirement, 598.3 times
85% to take into account vicissitudes,
I calculate that sum at $150,323.000.

<P>

81  	Accordingly I allow the following amounts and make the following
orders:-
<P>

82  	1.  Verdict for the plaintiff against the first and second
defendants.
<P>

83  	2.   The cross action is stood out of the list.
<P>

84  	3.  The action against the third defendant is also stood out of
the list.
<P>

85  	I allow general damages of $110.00.00.  I allow interest on
general damages of $4,950.00.  I allow out of pocket expenses of
$4,330.00.  I
allow past gratuitous domestic assistance of $16,140.00.  I allow future
domestic assistance of $14,559.00.  I allow
physiotherapy of $2,530.00.  I
allow future medical practitioner expenses of $750.00.  I allow future pain
management of $4,000.00.
 I allow future sundry expenses of $5,000.00.  I allow
a sum for past wage loss and interest thereon to be calculated by the parties.
I allow future wage loss of $150,373.00.  I grant the parties liberty to apply
to complete any calculations and to file formal orders.
<P>

86  	I reserve costs.
