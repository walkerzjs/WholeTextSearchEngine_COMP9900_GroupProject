<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - form - capacity - difference in susbtance)</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff commenced proceedings on 23 July this year
against the defendants in relation to a publication in <i>The Sydney Morning
Herald</i> on 20 July.
<P>

2   	The article, on pages 1 and 4, bears the headline
"<i>Nightmare on Struggle Street for Former AMP Boss"</i>.  It bears the
by-line of the second defendant.
<P>

3   	The first three paragraphs (including the lead-in) set the
relevant theme:
<P>

<i>"As the banks were deciding yesterday to terminate their $1.2 million deal
for favourable treatment from John Laws, details emerged
of another corporate
deal involving Law's radio colleague, Alan Jones.  David Leser reports.</i>
<P>

<i>The former chief executive of the AMP turned a blind eye to a secret deal
between the company and the broadcaster Alan Jones in the
early 1990s in which
it agreed to a $7 million debt refinancing scheme for South Sydney Leagues
Club, of which Jones was then director
of football.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Ian Salmon believed the deal was designed to stop Jones's damaging on-air
attacks on the AMP but said he made `an absolute point
of not knowing
...because sometimes it is best if things are taken out of your hands'".</i>
<P>

4   	From the whole of the matter complained of the plaintiff
contends the ordinary reasonable reader would understand it to be
carrying the
following imputations in its natural and ordinary meaning:  
<P>

<i>"5(a)	The plaintiff was a dishonest broadcaster in that he secretly agreed
with the AMP society that he would cease to criticise the
AMP Society on air in
return for the AMP Society agreeing to provide a substantial benefit to the
South Sydney Rugby League Club
of which he was Director of Football.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The plaintiff behaved unprofessionally as a broadcaster in that he
secretly agreed with the AMP Society that he would cease to
criticise the AMP
Society on air in return for the AMP Society agreeing to provide a substantial
benefit to the South Sydney Rugby
League Club of which he was Director of
Football".</i>
<P>

5   	In respect of imputation (a), it is argued for the
defendant that it is defective in form.  It is submitted that the nature
of the
alleged dishonesty does not seem to be adequately explained or appropriately
formulated.  The explanatory words namely, <i>"in the that he ... director of
football</i>" do not seem in themselves, and without more, necessarily to
encapsulate any notion of dishonesty at all.  The defendants in its
correspondence through its solicitors with those of the plaintiff, suggested
that the imputation ought to be re-cast to make the
nature of the alleged
dishonesty abundantly clear.  In development of this complaint Mr Sackar Q.C.
for the defendant submitted that
the imputation does not really explain in a
way that is synonymous or an amplification of the notion of dishonesty unless,
for example,
it was suggested that what the plaintiff was doing was ceasing to
express his honest views in favour of views which were not honestly
held and
that he ceased to do so by reason of the secret deal.  The precise notion of
dishonesty is not "<i>distilled</i>", it was submitted.
<P>

6   	Mr Blackburn for the plaintiff took the robust approach in
submitting that the criticism made of imputation (a) "<i>wore an air of great
unreality"</i>.  As Gleeson CJ said in <b><i>Drummoyne Municipal Council v
Australian Broadcasting Corporation </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 135</a> at 137B
"<i>Almost any attribution of an act or condition to a person is capable of
both further refinement and further generalisation.  In any
given case a
judgment needs to be made as to the degree of particularity or generality which
is appropriate to the occasion and as
to what constitutes the necessary
specificity.  If a problem arises, the solution will usually be found in
considerations of practical
justice rather than philology".</i>  The imputation
it is submitted for the plaintiff does capture the sting, requires no further
refinement and no issue arises as to
the discernment of the meaning of it.  It
is fanciful to suggest that even an "<i>obtuse</i>" jury would have any
difficulty in being able to discern that the matter complained of carries an
imputation with that <i>"sting</i>" and substance.
<P>

7   	Upon consideration I am of the view in the end that the
imputation does capture the sting.  The dishonesty in the plaintiff
was
constituted by the entering into by him of the secret agreement with the AMP
founding the cessation of his criticism on air.
 Mr Blackburn agreed that the
imputation could have been re-casted to the effect that the plaintiff was a
dishonest broadcaster in
that he had been relentlessly critical of the
management of the AMP Society and had secretly agreed to moderate or suppress
those
criticisms upon the South Sydney Football Club receiving a commercial
benefit from the AMP.  That would mean the same thing.
<P>

8   	I am of the view that the imputation is proper in form;  it
is inherently consistent in its structure by identifying the condition
of the
plaintiff as "<i>dishonest</i>" and the reason therefor.  On any reasonable
basis both components do hang together.  I am also of the view that the
imputation as
a matter of law is also capable of being carried by the matter
complained of and is capable of being defamatory.
<P>

9   	Imputation (a) therefore will go to the jury.
<P>

10   	As to imputation (b), this imputation suffers, it is said
by the defendant, from the same defect as imputation (a) and/or
is incapable of
arising from the natural and ordinary meaning of the matter complained of
(although it may possibly be available
as a true innuendo) or does not differ
in substance from imputation (a) and thus contravenes SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p67" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 67</a> r 11 (3).
<P>

11   	With regard to form, this imputation is structurally sound
in the sense that the act of the plaintiff (behaved unprofessionally)
is
identified and the basis therefor is set out in the imputation.  
<P>

12   	The real problem as to "<i>form</i>" is what is to be
understood by the word "<i>unprofessionally</i>"?  It is submitted for the
plaintiff that the word is used in a "<i>colloquial</i>" sense and recourse was
had to the Macquarie Thesaurus which discloses "<i>unprofessional</i>" as a
word cognate with "<i>unworthy</i>" (and <i>"irregular"</i> and
<i>"unchristian</i>").  The use of a thesaurus has been criticised as a
mechanism for the proliferation of imputations (<b><i>Grubb v Bristol United
Press</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%201%20QB%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 1 QB 309</a> at 329 per Holroyd Pearce LJ).  The use of a
thesaurus to identify how a word would be understood in a colloquial sense is
equally
discouraged not for the least reason that it points to the very flaw
identified by the defendant and discouraged by the Court of
Appeal
(<b><i>Singleton &amp; Anor v Ffrench &amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 425)</a>
namely, the exposure of uncertainty as to what the word means.  I do not
consider that any comfort is available to the plaintiff
from what I held in
<b><i>Trevethan v Bhagat</i></b> (unreported, 27 February 1996) in relation to
the expression "<i>blatant breach of trust</i>" when determining the
availability of a contextual imputation.  In that case I held that there is no
embarrassment to the plaintiff
by reason of what I considered to be the
abundant clarity of what the proposed contextual imputation was stating.
<P>

13   	I am not persuaded of the clarity of the meaning to be
given to the word "<i>unprofessionally</i>" as used in this imputation.  It is
thus defective in form and amenable to being struck out.
<P>

14   	Being of uncertain meaning the imputation presently does
not lend itself to the consideration of the issue of whether it differs
in
substance from imputation (a).  Arguably, I suppose, a person can be
"<i>unprofessional</i>" (in some sense of that word) without being
"<i>dishonest</i>".  But difficulty is encountered when that which identifies
the quality of <i>"unprofessional</i>" (or some other word) is the very matter
that founds the identification of the quality of "<i>dishonesty</i>".
<P>

15   	Further, within the context of the <i>"colloquial</i>"
connotation to be attached to the use of the word "<i>unprofessional</i>" I am
simply unable to come to the view that the matter complained of is capable, as
a matter of law, of giving rise to such a proposition.
<P>

16   	Imputation (b) will be struck out.  
<P>

17   	I am of the view that the plaintiff should be given an
opportunity to re-plead a second imputation.  This case however is
of
comparative simplicity.  The article is short, the first imputation is clear,
it is serious and is capable of being conveyed.
 This matter lends itself to
orders and directions being given for the separate determination by the jury of
the issue reserved to
that tribunal by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a></i> (as amended).  
<P>

18   	The plaintiff should promptly attend to the question of
re-pleading and indicate without delay to the defendants whether he
proposes so
to do and if he does, in what manner.  If the plaintiff does propose to
re-plead, the defendant will be required promptly
to inform the plaintiff of
any objection to the proposed new imputation so that it can be adjudged with a
view to the rapid referral
of the matter to the Holding List for the early
determination of the threshold issue.  The defendants will also be required to
state
their position on the issue of publication;  in that regard I trust that
there would be no issue at all and that the relevant admissions
will be
made.
<P>

19   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputation (a) will go to the jury.
<P>

2.	Imputation (b) is struck out with leave to replead.
<P>

3.	Within 14 days the plaintiff is to inform the defendants either that he does
not propose to re-plead or, if he does, the nature
and form of the re-pleaded
imputation.
<P>

4.	Within 7 days of the plaintiff indicating an intention to re-plead as per
Order 3, the defendants are to notify the nature of
any objection they take to
the proposed new imputation.
<P>

5.	In the event of the plaintiff either not re-pleading or proposing to
re-plead, within the period of 7 days referred to in Order
4, the defendants
are to notify the plaintiff as to whether or not there is any issue as to
publication as alleged in paragraph 4
of the Statement of Claim.
<P>

6.	Each party is to pay its own costs of the application heard on 27 August
1999.
<P>

7.	The matter is listed for further directions and, if necessary, argument on 8
October 1999.
