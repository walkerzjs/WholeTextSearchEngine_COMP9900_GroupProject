<P>

11844/93	<b>TC by his tutor Kris Sabatino   v   THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH
WALES</b> 
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : The hearing of this matter concluded on 16 October 1998, subject
to counsel for the plaintiff then being permitted
to present written
submissions in reply.  Those submissions, and they were extensive, were not
received until mid December 1998.
 Through its solicitor the defendant then
requested that judgment be deferred until the defendant considered the
plaintiff's submissions
and responded to them if need be. The final submissions
from the defendant were not received until 29 January 1999.  Inevitably
therefore
the delivery of this judgment has been delayed, but I express my
appreciation to counsel for both parties for the assistance given
to the Court
in this most difficult case.
<P>

2	Throughout these proceedings the plaintiff has been referred to as "TC", his
father as "HF" and his mother as "HM".  I shall use
those titles in the course
of this judgment.
<P>

3	TC began proceedings by his tutor HF seeking damages from the State of New
South Wales as first defendant, Marrickville Women's
Refuge Limited as second
defendant, Pamela Dahl-Helm as third defendant, Brent Waters as fourth
defendant and John McCourt as fifth
defendant.  The hearing of the cause
commenced before me on 14 October 1997.  There were a number of interruptions
which it is unnecessary
for present purposes to address, except for those
interruptions which led to the proceedings against the second, the fourth and
the
fifth defendants being finalised and which led to the replacement of HF as
tutor.
<P>

4	On 4 November 1997 Mr Shand of Queen's Counsel, appearing for the plaintiff,
sought and was granted an adjournment in order to
pursue an application (for
obvious reasons, before another judge of this Court) for an order for the
removal of HF as tutor and for
the appointment of another tutor.  Sperling J
made an order for the removal of HF and then the hearing of this cause was
delayed
to afford an opportunity for appeal against that order.  Kris Sabatino
was appointed as tutor for TC in place of HF, and on 23 January
1998 Simos J
ordered that Mr Sabatino's appointment continue "until further order".  The
order of Simos J remains in force.
<P>

5	On 19 December 1997 compromises of TC's claims against the second, the fourth
and the fifth defendants were approved by Master
Malpass.
<P>

6	The third defendant at no stage appeared, and Mr Shand did not seek to prove
a case against her.  Ultimately he did not seek to
assert that the evidence
established a case against the third defendant.  Plainly it does not, and I
propose to direct the entry
of judgment in her favour.
<P>

7	Thus it is that eventually the plaintiff pursued his claim by his present
tutor only against the first defendant.
<P>

8	On 28 October 1997, that is at a time when the second, fourth and fifth
defendants were parties to the cause, I ordered that there
be a separate trial
on the issue of liability.  The precise orders which I made at that time were
these:
<P>

	<i>"1.	That the issues of liability and damages against all defendants be
tried separately.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	That to the extent that proof of loss or damage is or forms any part of
the plaintiff's causes of action against any of the defendants,
the question of
causation of any loss or damage to the plaintiff by an alleged act or default
on the part of any of the defendants
be tried together with the issue of
damages."</i>
<P>

9	The orders were so expressed in anticipation that the question of causation
could be dealt with conveniently with the issue of
damages should fault be
proved.
<P>

10	So it is that the hearing has been limited to the issue of liability and it
is therefore that issue which is the subject of this
judgment.
<P>

	<b><u>The cause of action outlined</u></b>
<P>

11	The plaintiff has sued the first defendant in negligence.  I shall presently
address the claim closely but by way of introduction
and in the broadest of
terms, the cause could be said to be one in which the plaintiff has sued the
defendant in respect of the acts
and/or omissions of officers of the Department
of Youth and Community Services (YACS).  In consequence of their failure to act
appropriately
to protect him in his tender years, the plaintiff claims to have
suffered harm, both physical and psychological. "Intentional unlawful
conduct"
by the first defendant has also been pleaded.  Precisely what the pleader
intended in such added expression of the cause
of action is not immediately
clear, but in the course of his final submissions Mr Shand made it plain that
the plaintiff's claim
was based solely in negligence.  I observe at this point
that Mr Shand did not contend that the plaintiff had available a statutory
cause of action, although reliance was placed upon the <i>Child Welfare Act</i>
for the purposes of the common law claim in a manner to which I shall refer
later.  In its final form the amended statement of claim
particularised the
negligence "and intentional and unlawful conduct" of the first defendant as
follows:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	Failure to conduct an independent, impartial, prompt and reasonable
investigation of the allegations of physical abuse, sexual
abuse and neglect of
the Plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Failure properly to investigate the allegations made by the
father.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Blindly and loyally supporting the claims of the mother to custody of
the Plaintiff on ideological grounds, which precluded appropriate
consideration
of the need for further investigations, or of the best interests of the
Plaintiff, or of the need to give the Plaintiff
the protection he needed from
the mother, or from those to whom her custody exposed him or of the risk of
injury.</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	Embarking upon a campaign to prevent the father from successfully
challenging the continuing custody of the Plaintiff by the
mother, regardless
of the true merits of the case or of the true needs of the Plaintiff for
protection.</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	Endeavouring to disrupt prevent and discourage continuing effective
legal representation of the father in his attempts to secure
custody of the
Plaintiff, and in his attempts between mid 1982 and July 1986 to protect the
Plaintiff from physical abuse, sexual
abuse and neglect whilst in the custody
of the mother.</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	Preventing and diverting the New South Wales Police Force, by its Child
Mistreatment Unit, from conducting its own investigation
by incorrectly
assuring that Unit that the Department had conducted its own proper and
thorough investigation of the alleged facts
and found the allegations by the
father to be without basis, and thus causing the Police Department to neglect
their duty.</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)	Preventing the full facts bearing upon the risk to the Plaintiff from
being made known, whether promptly or at all, to the Family
Court, the
Children's Court, the Child Mistreatment Unit of the New South Wales Police
Force and the Fourth Defendant, by failing
to give each of those Courts, bodies
or persons necessary access to the full facts which were in the possession of
the Department
or its servants or agents on reasonably capable of being
discovered by them by the necessary investigations.</i>
<P>

<i>	(h)	Engaging in a campaign against the father with a view to discrediting
and discouraging him and thereby impeding his prospects
of ever securing the
degree of custody and access or removing the Plaintiff into a safe environment
which he sought in order to protect
the Plaintiff against physical and
psychological injury and diminishing his prospects of preventing the mother
from continuing to
have the custody of the Plaintiff."</i>
<P>

12	Mr Shand did not rely upon the negligence as pleaded, and I shall not dwell
upon the deficiencies of the statement of claim.
 Ultimately in the course of
his final submissions Mr Shand identified the alleged acts and omissions relied
upon as supporting the
plaintiff's case and I shall consider the thrust of that
case in due course.
<P>

13	The first defendant has denied negligence.  The existence of a duty of care
has been denied, and so too has the breach of any
duty of care if found to
exist.  The defence also pleads reliance upon s 158 of the <i>Child Welfare
Act</i>.
<P>

14	The hearing of this cause occupied sixty-four days and the evidence was very
extensive.  Fifteen witnesses were called in the
plaintiff's case and fourteen
witnesses in the defendant's case.  In addition there were over 330 exhibits,
consisting largely of
documents produced by YACS upon discovery.  The
transcript of proceedings extended to well over 3000 pages.  I mention these
raw
statistics at the outset simply to emphasise the volume of evidence that
was introduced.  I do not propose to refer to all the evidence
in close detail;
this would not be a helpful exercise, even if the task was a practicable one,
which it is not.  I propose now to
record something of TC's background before
outlining how YACS became involved in TC's life.
<P>

	<b><u>TC's family history</u></b>
<P>

15	TC was born on 10 February 1980.  His parents had married in Syria in May
1978.  HM was only 15&#189; years old at the time of
marriage and was unable to
speak any English when she came with her husband HF to live in Australia.  It
is clear from the evidence
that the marriage was troubled from the start.  This
was no doubt due in part to the arduous lifestyle of TC's parents.  HF was
industrious
and worked long hours, firstly as a carpet cleaner but subsequently
in the conduct of a pizza shop and two other food outlets in
which HM assisted
him.
<P>

16	In August 1979, that is during her pregnancy, HM was admitted to Mount St
Margaret Hospital, Ryde under the care of Dr Roxanas.
 Dr Roxanas diagnosed HM
to be suffering from a condition of manic depressive psychosis which he
described in evidence as being a
chemical disorder.  This was a condition that
could be treated effectively in the doctor's opinion, but absent appropriate
medication
HM's condition could fluctuate.  HM discharged herself from hospital
without the approval of Dr Roxanas.  Later in her pregnancy
HM returned to
hospital, this time to Gladesville.  Dr Roxanas said that he was not aware of
her condition when she was discharged
from that hospital and there was no later
evidence of complaints or treatment attributable to that psychotic condition.
However Dr
Waters, in assessing HM in 1984, spoke with Dr Atreya, who had
treated HM in Gladesville Hospital in 1979, and Dr Waters recorded
in his
report of 1 November 1984 that Dr Atreya considered HM's psychosis to have been
a reaction to cultural isolation and considerable
stress.  Dr Atreya said that
following treatment HM <i>"returned to a level of complete sanity with no
evidence of psychosis"</i>.  From his point of view, Dr Waters, having assessed
HM in 1984, found no evidence then of psychosis.
<P>

17	TC was born prematurely but from the time he came home from hospital there
was friction between his parents, much of it surrounding
the care of the child.
HM left HF for the first time in November 1980 and went to a refuge at Como and
on 21 November 1980 appeared
in the Sutherland Court of Petty Sessions seeking
and obtaining an order for the custody of TC.  Following those proceedings HM
and
HF became reconciled but the reconciliation did not last.  HM left HF
finally in February 1982 and went to live at the Marrickville
refuge where she
remained until November 1982 at which time she obtained accommodation in a flat
at Waterloo.  Subsequently HM moved
to The Rocks and she was living there when
proceedings in the Family Court came to their conclusion in 1986.
<P>

18	Following their final separation in February 1982, HM and HF were
continually engaged in litigation in the Family Court until
the middle of 1986
and the course of this litigation assumes much significance by way of
background in this cause.  Particulars of
the various applications, hearings
and orders in the Family Court are to be found in Exhibit 9.
<P>

19	After the final separation and before Family Court litigation began there
were proceedings in the Children's Court where HM sought
custody of TC and
maintenance. That court made an order on 28 April 1982 restraining HF from
assaulting, molesting, harassing or
otherwise interfering with HM and TC and
adjourned proceedings to 12 May 1982, for mention on that date.  On the night
of 28 April
1982 HM went to a club with some other residents of the
Marrickville refuge and whilst she was there a petrol bomb exploded in the
premises.  HM was seriously injured and admitted to Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital where she remained until August 1982.  Whilst HM
was hospitalised, an
order was made in the Children's Court on 3 May 1982 granting custody of the
child to the third defendant. 
That same day Dovey J made an order in the
Family Court in the third defendant's favour.  On 5 May 1982 Dovey J granted
custody to
the third defendant until further order, giving HF access two days
per week.
<P>

20	I do not propose to review here every one of the many applications recorded
in Exhibit 9, but after HM was released from hospital,
Dovey J made an order on
25 August 1982 whereunder HM was to have care and control of TC and HF access
three days per week.  There
was some later variation to the days of access and
there was regular dispute between HF and HM concerning the handing over of TC
for access purposes and concerning his return after access.
<P>

21	In August 1983 Pawley J pronounced a decree nisi for the dissolution of the
marriage between HM and HF, the decree being made
absolute on 16 August 1983.
Two weeks later, on 30 August 1983, Pawley J varied the earlier order for
custody, ordering joint custody
to HF and HM with HF to have TC from Friday to
Sunday and HM for the remainder of the week.  HF agreed in cross examination
that
on no less than six occasions thereafter he refused to return TC after
access.
<P>

22	The fact that there was a joint order for custody led to the dismissal of an
application for the issue of a warrant on one occasion
when HF failed to
deliver TC to HM on an appointed date.  This prompted further proceedings
before Pawley J who on 20 January 1984
ordered that HM and HF have joint
guardianship of TC, but his Honour ordered custody to HM with access to HF.

<P>

23	Exhibit 9 records that there followed many applications to the Family Court
concerning TC.  The next noteworthy proceedings were
heard by Ellis J on 30 May
1984 when his Honour dismissed HF's application for custody and guardianship
and ordered that the child
be surrendered to HM.  
<P>

24	Then on 27 July 1984 HF made a further application, this time for custody
and interim custody.  Alternatively he applied for
an order that TC be placed
in custody at Dalmar Homes.  HF sought that HM be denied access.  He sought an
order for short service
of his application, but Ellis J refused short service
on that same date.  HF did not have access to TC again, other than when he
saw
him with Dr Waters in September 1984, and on a further occasion at Montrose in
1986, until proceedings commenced before Bulley
J in April 1986.  The decision
of Ellis J on 30 May 1984 was the subject of appeal but of particular
significance in this cause was
an application made by the Director General of
the Department of Youth and Community Services to intervene in the proceedings
then
pending before the Family Court concerning the custody of TC.  On 28
September 1984 Hogan J granted leave to the Director General
to intervene.  By
that time the department wanted TC to be placed at Montrose for assessment
having regard to allegations that TC
had been exposed to sexual abuse.  Then on
19 December 1984 an order was made for the expedition of the Director General's
application.
<P>

25	On 12 April 1985 the Director General's application for interim custody was
refused.  It will be necessary to return to the subject
of the Director
General's intervention when considering the allegations of negligence made by
the plaintiff, but I record the fact
of the intervention and the outcome of the
application in this short background narrative of proceedings in the Family
Court.
<P>

26	When refusing the intervention application, Ellis J set the hearing of the
substantive application involving HF, HM and TC down
for hearing before Hogan J
on 24 June 1985.  On that date HF did not appear, being absent in Syria, and
the matter was accordingly
adjourned and refixed for hearing before Hogan J on
18 November 1985.  His Honour embarked upon the hearing in November 1985 but
on
27 November 1985 disqualified himself from proceeding with the cause.  
<P>

27	Thus a new date had to be fixed and the competing applications for
guardianship and custody were ultimately fixed for hearing
before Bulley J.
His Honour began to hear the applications in April 1986 and the hearing
concluded in June 1986.  Finally, on 31
July 1986, Bulley J ordered that HF
have sole guardianship and custody of TC, with no access to HM.
<P>

28	Prior to those proceedings before Bulley J HM had remarried, and whilst she
was absent from Australia visiting a sick parent
in Syria, TC was physically
abused at a time when he was being cared for by HM's then husband.  This abuse
had led to the making
of an order in the Children's Court at Yasmar in March
1986 for TC's placement in a place of safety with foster parents.  He had
been
so placed when HM returned from Syria, and he did not return to HM at any time
before Bulley J made his final orders.  I observe
that an officer of YACS laid
the complaint in the Children's Court on which that court made the placement
order in March 1986.
<P>

	<b><u>The involvement of YACS</u></b>
<P>

29	Sufficient has I think been said by way of introduction to proceed to
outline the evidence as to how and when YACS became involved
in entertaining
what proved to be a great number of complaints that were made as to the alleged
ill treatment of TC whilst in his
mother's care up to March 1986.  The
complaints initially concerned alleged physical ill treatment and verbal abuse.
The first of
the complaints appears to have been in November 1980, but their
frequency increased with the passage of time.  Later on there were
complaints
concerning alleged sexual abuse.  When complaints of this nature were first
made to YACS I shall address shortly.
<P>

30	In essence it is contended that the officers of YACS who became involved in
the case did not investigate the complaints properly,
and that eventually there
was a failure to remove TC from his mother's care when circumstances called for
this to occur.
<P>

31	I propose to identify the officers of YACS who became involved in TC's case
and the periods of their involvement.
<P>

32	HF first approached YACS expressing concern about TC in November 1980.
Exhibit A(a) records that HF saw Ms Medus on 25 November
1980, just after HM
and HF separated for the first time.  Ms Medus recorded that her inquiries led
her to conclude that TC was being
adequately cared for by HM, and the records
disclose that no action was considered by YACS to be necessary then; and, of
course,
HM and HF subsequently became reconciled, unhappily only for a
relatively short period.
<P>

33	On 14 December 1981 Ms Medus made a home visit, again in response to
complaints by HF that TC was being neglected.  Ms Medus
apparently saw HM on
that visit, and she also saw TC, who she wrote <i>"looked healthy and appeared
to be receiving adequate care"</i>.  It is clear that Ms Medus considered no
action was warranted at that time.  Ms Medus is deceased.
<P>

34	In identifying the officers of YACS who were allegedly negligent, Mr Shand
has focussed on the period from October 1982 until
July 1986.  However from
March 1986 TC was not with HM, because of the order made in the Children's
Court at that time, so strictly
the period to be considered ends with the date
of that order in the Children's Court.
<P>

35	No complaint is made about the conduct of Ms Medus (although Mr Male
recorded HF's dissatisfaction with the behaviour of Ms Medus
in October 1982:
see Exhibit A(e)) and it will not be necessary to revisit the period prior to
October 1982.  Suffice it to say that
I am satisfied the evidence does not
establish any act or omission of an officer of YACS in the period 1980 to
October 1982 which
could be regarded as constituting negligence, even assuming
a private duty of care.
<P>

36	I propose in the paragraphs that follow to number those paragraphs which
introduce the various officers of YACS against whom
an allegation of negligence
is made in the plaintiff's case.
<P>

(i)	The first of the officers complained of is Mr Plater who was a field
officer at the Stanmore office in October 1982.  By that
time HF and HM had
separated for the last time and indeed they had been separated since February
1982.  HM was then living at the
Marrickville refuge and HF visited the Sydney
office of YACS on 11 October 1982 where he saw Mr Male.  To Mr Male he
complained that
HM went out every night <i>"having a good time with the
men"</i> and leaving TC tied to the bed at the women's refuge.  Mr Male
referred that complaint to the Stanmore office and here the complaint
was
assigned to Mr Plater for investigation.
<P>

The results of Mr Plater's investigations are recorded in Exhibit A (g) and
Exhibit A(h).  For the present I summarise the outcome
of his investigations
briefly.  According to Mr Plater, he visited the refuge where he spoke to HM
and to a refuge worker.  They
both denied any neglect or abuse by HM and Mr
Plater concluded no intervention by YACS was warranted.
<P>

Further inquiries by Mr Plater in December 1982 appear to have satisfied him
that YACS should not intervene.  He recorded on 13
December 1982 that he had
contacted Dr Condon and the doctor advised him that HF brought TC to his
surgery when he had access to
TC and that the doctor saw no evidence of abuse
or neglect of the child.  Mr Plater also recorded in Exhibit A(j) that inquiry
at
the Tempe refuge revealed HM and TC had moved, but he advised Mr Hulbert HM
was to phone Mr Hulbert to indicate whether TC's immunisation
had been
completed.
<P>

(ii)	Mr Hulbert was the assistant senior district officer at Stanmore at the
end of 1982 and he responded to an inquiry by the Director
General following a
complaint by HF to the Minister that HM was neglecting TC.  Mr Hulbert's
involvement is reflected in his memo,
Exhibit A(k).  In that memo, directed to
the Director General, he wrote that:
<P>

	<i>"There has been a span of two years of investigation in this case and on
each occasion there has been no substance in the allegations."</i>
<P>

Mr Hulbert also compiled Exhibit A(m) and Exhibit A(n) to which I shall refer
later.
<P>

(iii)	Mr Finch was at the Stanmore office as the senior district officer from
September 1982 until September 1983.  Whilst he was
there he met HF.  I note at
this point that HF asserted that he had met Mr Finch earlier in 1980 but Mr
Finch denied having done
so and denied having the conversations then attributed
to him by HF.  Indeed Mr Finch was not at Stanmore in 1980.  Weighing those
denials by Mr Finch, I do not find that Mr Finch met HF prior to January
1983.
<P>

However Mr Finch did meet HF when he visited the Stanmore office on 28 January
1983.  HF then complained that his child was being
ill treated by HM and he
asked Mr Finch to look at the bruising which the child exhibited as a
consequence of such abuse.  According
to Mr Finch he saw no bruises, although
he did examine the child.
<P>

Several days later, on 2 February 1983, Mr Finch again saw HF, this time
accompanied by Mrs Denley.  On this occasion three affidavits
were produced by
HF which referred to an episode when TC was tied to a cot in March 1982.  I
shall return to consider the complaint
about TC being tied to the cot in closer
detail but for the present I record that this complaint was made at this time
to Mr Finch.
 As Exhibit A(o) records, Mr Finch determined that the complaint
the subject of the affidavits would be <i>"re-examined"</i> and Mr Finch
himself went to the refuge and spoke to two workers there.  According to Mr
Finch these workers denied the neglect alleged
of HM.
<P>

The memo prepared by Mr Finch, Exhibit A(o) was directed to the Sydney office
because by then HM and the child were living at Waterloo.
 The forwarding of
this memo led to the involvement of Mrs Burgess and Mr Hanrahan.  Mrs Burgess,
having received the memo Exhibit
A(o), referred the subject matter to Mr
Hanrahan for his attention.
<P>

Mr Finch was later involved in events in 1984 when consideration was being
given by YACS to allegations of sexual abuse of TC. 
Mr Finch presided over a
case conference on 23 August 1984 when there was discussion as to what action
YACS should take in respect
of the child.
<P>

(iv)	Mr Hanrahan's involvement, commencing with the referral by Mrs Burgess of
the subject matter of Exhibit A(o), extended until
November 1983.  He made a
home visit on 10 February 1983 but HM was then in hospital being treated for
the effects of her burns.
 Subsequent attempted home visits were made by Mr
Hanrahan on 18 February and 23 February 1983.  He did see HM and TC on 25
February
1983 and again on 7 March 1983.  He recorded in Exhibit A(aa) that
<P>

	<i> "There appears nothing to suggest there was anything but a normal happy
relationship between the child and his mother."</i>
<P>

Subsequent complaints, including complaints that HM had inflicted scratches on
TC, were investigated by Mr Hanrahan, whose involvement
ended with his file
note dated 21 November 1983 (see Exhibit A(zz)).
<P>

(v)	Mrs Burgess had occasion to consider TC's case over a longer period than Mr
Hanrahan.  Whilst Mrs Burgess was absent from work
between 22 June and 19 July
1983, she returned to the Sydney office then until September 1983.  There was a
further period of absence
on other duties, conducting a staff developmental
programme until July 1984, but thereafter Mrs Burgess had a further period of
involvement
with TC's case until the end of October 1984.
<P>

(vi)	Mr Langshaw was the Director General of YACS when in March 1983 the then
Shadow Minister for Health and Youth and Community
Services forwarded to him a
deal of material raising allegations of mistreatment and neglect of TC by HM.
The allegation made against
Mr Langshaw, which I shall return to consider
later, is that he did not react appropriately to the receipt of that material
from
Mrs Foot.
<P>

(vii)	Ms Louise Boulter was posted to the Sydney district office as a child
protection worker in March 1982 and she remained there
until the middle of
1984.  Ms Boulter was transferred to the Central Metropolitan Regional Office
in about June 1984.
<P>

Ms Boulter became active in TC's case in May 1983 when she made inquiry as to
the child's well being at the kindergarten he was
then attending.  Thereafter
Ms Boulter made a number of home visits to see HM and TC, the last of which
appears to have been on 28
June 1984 (see Exhibit A(abp)).  Ms Boulter was
inter alia called upon to investigate a complaint that HM had scratched TC, she
made
arrangements for HM to take voluntary work and she became aware in May
1984 of the allegation of sexual abuse on TC.  Ms Boulter
was later involved in
case conferences to determine what action YACS should take as to the issue of
the alleged sexual abuse.
<P>

(vii)	Mr Chris Lungley, then a district officer of YACS, became involved in the
matter of TC in 1984.  Exhibit A(abl) records that
on 12 April 1984 he attended
on a home visit with Ms Boulter to the home of HM and TC, they having then
recently moved to new accommodation
at Cumberland Street, The Rocks.  Shortly
thereafter a complaint made by HF was recorded by Mr Lungley in Exhibit A(abp)
as to the
alleged sexual abuse of his son by HM.  Mr Lungley had continuing
involvement in the matter through the months of 1984 and (inter
alia) he
attended with a child protection worker, Ms Ralston, on an interview with Mr
and Mrs Tiba to inquire as to the alleged sexual
misconduct by TC towards their
daughter (see Exhibit A(acl)).  Mr Lungley attended on HM to investigate the
allegations of her sexual
abuse of her son and he also attended on the
conferences concerning TC on 21 May 1984, 23 August 1984 (see Exhibit A(abg))
and subsequently
(see Exhibit A(ade)).
<P>

(ix)	Mr Bruce Callaghan was the regional director for the Central Metropolitan
Region in August 1984 and he still held that position
in January 1985.  It is
alleged that he was negligent in the discharge of his responsibilities in this
period but I will return to
consider that issue in due course.  Mr Callaghan
considered the material supplied to him by HF on 21 August 1984, concluding
that
there was evidence that TC
<P>

	<i>"was involved in sexual activities which he alleges he learnt from his
mother and a friend of hers called Judith."</i>
<P>

(See Exhibit A(abf)).  Mr Callaghan further concluded, as evidenced in that
exhibit, that
<P>

	<i>"There appears to be a strong prima facie case that the child has been
abused."</i>
<P>

Mr Callaghan was later involved in the decision making process that led
ultimately to YACS making application to intervene in proceedings
in the Family
Court (see Exhibit A(acj)).
<P>

(x)	Ms Judith Withers (also known as Parker), a psychologist, and Ms Leigh
Ralston, a child protection worker, both of whom were
attached to YACS, became
involved in TC's case.  On 21 August 1984 they went to the child care centre at
Tempe where TC was then
attending.  They discussed TC with the director of the
centre and with TC's teacher and his "special person".  They observed the
child's behaviour at the centre and they also interviewed him.  Later they
visited his mother on 22 August 1984 when HM was questioned
about the
allegations of sexual abuse.  Ms Withers and Ms Ralston were the joint authors
of a lengthy report dated 3 September 1984
(Exhibit A(abj)) in which the
conclusion was expressed that TC
<P>

	<i>"is an emotionally deprived little boy who has been sexually abused and who
has been exposed to adult sexual behaviour."</i>
<P>

Both Ms Withers and Ms Ralston swore affidavits subsequently to support the
application made in the Family Court for the intervention
by YACS in the
proceedings then current between HM and HF.
<P>

(xi)	The legal officers of YACS became involved in the decision making process
in 1984 as to whether YACS should take action in
the Children's Court or seek
to intervene in the Family Court.
<P>

Mr James Heagney, now a magistrate, was in August 1984 the senior legal officer
for YACS and as his memorandum to Mr Callaghan dated
31 August 1984 discloses
(Exhibit A(abr)), Mr Heagney's opinion then was that proceedings should not be
taken in the Children's Court
but rather YACS should make available to TC's
separate legal representative such material as YACS had.  Subsequently, as
Exhibit
A(adi) records, Mr Heagney instructed the State Crown Solicitor to make
application to the Family Court for leave for the Director
General to intervene
in proceedings in that court for the purpose of seeking an interim order for
custody of the child for thirty
days so as to permit of a psychiatric
assessment.
<P>

Mr Heagney did have some prior involvement in this matter in March 1983 when he
forwarded to the regional director of the Central
Metropolitan Region
affidavits that had been by that time filed in the Family Court concerning the
custody of TC.  He had found those
affidavits on his desk and, as Exhibit H
records, he forwarded those documents to Mr Callaghan.
<P>

Mr David Croke was the second legal officer of YACS to become involved in the
matter.  In January 1985 when Mr Heagney went on leave
Mr Croke assumed his
responsibilities and Mr Heagney resigned shortly after his return from leave.
Mr Croke was then his successor
as senior legal officer and as such he was
involved in the application of YACS in the Family Court.
<P>

37	It is clear from the evidence that at no time prior to the surfacing of the
allegations of sexual abuse did any officer of YACS
ever consider that TC's
circumstances warranted intervention by YACS in order to remove the child from
his mother's care.  Certainly
at no time was it considered that there had been
physical or verbal abuse such as called for this to be done.
<P>

38	Mr Callaghan's note referred to earlier (Exhibit A(abf)) reflects real
concern for TC in his then circumstances, which included
by that time the
serious allegations of sexual abuse and evidence that supported such
allegations.
<P>

	<b><u>Sexual abuse:  The evidence assessed</u></b>
<P>

39		I propose now to identify the evidence as to sexual abuse, to evaluate it
and to determine when it was that knowledge of relevant
evidence on the issue
reached YACS.
<P>

40		On 11 March 1983 HF made a statutory declaration, Exhibit A(t), in which he
referred to two occasions on which HF was purchasing
fruit when TC took a
carrot and 
<P>

	<i>"made certain motions with it between his legs, saying `That is very nice
just here.'"</i>
<P>

41	The evidence does not satisfy me that the declaration came to the knowledge
of any officer of YACS at about the time it was made
but the account of the two
incidents referred to in the declaration is to be contrasted with what HF swore
in his affidavit in the
Family Court on 24 July 1984, which affidavit became
Exhibit R before me.  In paragraph 10 of the affidavit, sworn some sixteen
months
after the statutory declaration, HF said:
<P>

	<i>"I first became aware of [TC's] sexual behaviour early in 1983 when, in a
food shop with me, he picked up a carrot and rubbed it between
his legs and
said `That is nice just here'.  I was very embarrassed and took away the carrot
and said `How do you know about this'.
 He replied `Mummy, Judith, Karen and
Cassie, they do that, it is very nice Daddy.'"</i>
<P>

42	It is to be observed that there are very significant differences in the
extracts from the declaration and the affidavit referred
to above.  In
particular, there is absent from the declaration any allegation of the
involvement of the child's mother, Judith, Karen
or Cassie in any activity with
a carrot.  I find myself unable to accept at face value the assertion as to the
child's conduct contained
in the declaration of 11 March 1983.  
<P>

43	However, in any event even if that description of behaviour was acceptable
as a description of what occurred, it is not necessarily
behaviour indicative
of sexual abuse.  Indeed, I accept the evidence which Dr Scott gave about this
at pp 1867-1868:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Would you agree that that behaviour, on the assumption that the child
had indulged in it, could well be regarded as evidence
of the child being
subjected to sexual abuse?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, it could equally be seen as what is within normal limits for young
children in terms of their sexual behaviour.  It is sometimes
difficult to
determine the spectrum or continuum when the normal sexuality and curiosity and
sex play of preschool age children begins
and ends.  That type of behaviour one
would see in many creches, kindergartens, in many families, and I would not
draw the conclusion
from that in relation to sexual abuse.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Coupled with the information that you have as to the signs later which
we have been through in detail, would you think that the
connection between
sexual abuse and that behaviour in paragraph 7 could not be ignored?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I wouldn't put great weight on it in the same way that there are
descriptions of sexualised play at the kindergarten in which
other children are
much more active than the child in question and there is some margin or
participation by the child.  I really
wouldn't put weight on this behaviour as
indicative of sexual abuse.  I will give it low weight.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Low weight?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  But perhaps better than low weight if one connected it with later
behaviour conveyed by the information that you have which indicates
to you that
sexual abuse has occurred?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  It's a possibility, but I wouldn't want to draw a conclusion about
it.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  To a responsible officer of a department such as the Youth and
Community Services, would you consider that that information ought
to put the
officer on guard as to the possibility of sexual abuse?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Not really, no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Not at all you would say, would you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I wouldn't say not at all.  I would say not really, no.   That type of
behaviour is extraordinarily common amongst preschool
aged children who are
sexually curious and, within certain limits, active.  That is the sort of
behaviour one would see, as I said,
in a kindergarten, children playing with
bananas, making little jokes, often as a result of children's contact with
other children
and the games they play.  I would not put salience on
that."</i>
<P>

44	Accordingly I am not satisfied by Exhibit A(t), or HF's evidence about it,
that TC was exposed to sexual abuse in 1983.
<P>

45	Of course, the affidavit of July 1984 makes an assertion which, if true,
would amount to improper behaviour by HM and those other
persons named in
paragraph 10, but by then allegations of sexual abuse had already arisen.
<P>

46	On 7 May 1984 HF had telephoned Ms Poppy Harris at the Royal Alexandra
Hospital for Children and told her that TC had asked him
to <i>"suck his
cock"</i>, and that HM and her friend did this (see Exhibit 10D). The
allegations made to Ms Harris were repeated to Dr Younan, to whom HF
took his
son on 7 May 1984.  Dr Younan had by then seen HF and TC many times, the first
of which was on 14 October 1983.  It was
on this last visit on 7 May 1984 that
HF first said that the child behaved in the manner already described to Ms
Harris.  On the
following day HF complained of sexual abuse of TC by HM at the
Bankstown Area Health Central (Exhibit 10J).  On 11 May 1984 Ms Harris
alerted
YACS, prompting the completion of a "Child at Risk Notification" (see Exhibit
A(mmm)).  
<P>

47	HF also took his son to a social worker, Mr Malak, on 7 May 1984.  Mr
Malak's report of 9 May 1984 became part of Exhibit A(eee).
 Mr Malak had seen
TC twice in late 1983 and no allegations of a sexual nature arose then but when
HF took TC to Mr Malak on 7 May,
TC told Mr Malak that he asked HF to <i>"lick
his dickie"</i>.  TC told Mr Malak that his mother and Judith did that to him.
Mr Malak was unsuccessful in arranging to see HM but nevertheless
reported on 9
May that he was certain that the child had been <i>"exposed to the practice of
oral sexual act"</i>.
<P>

48	Dr Waters was very critical of Mr Malak's report of 9 May and said he gave
it very little weight.  Indeed, the doctor said in
the course of his evidence
(at T2146):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  What reliance did you place upon the second report of Mr Malak?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well, I gave it very little weight.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Why was that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well I think there were three - there are three things - firstly he
makes what seems to be a final conclusion about the matter
in terms of a
certainty that he has been abused in the way described or alleged based on just
having seen TC and the father and not
having had the opportunity to see the
mother, and bear in mind the nature of the problems between the two of them as
well.  So that's
the first thing.  The second thing is that the questioning
even as it is set out in the second report - I haven't got the second
report
here - the questioning even as it is set out in the second report indicates a
very leading line of questioning with the child
basically affirming
propositions put to the child.  It also appears as if the father was in the
room at the time.  That method of
questioning is simply invalid.  It is no more
valued with children than it is with adults.  Then the third reason is that Mr
Malak
doesn't consider any other possibilities.  I mean, for instance, the
incidents that he mainly questions about occurred in the shower
and children in
the shower - children, parents in bathing situations, there is often things
happen between children and parents in
bathing situations that have nothing to
do with sexual abuse.  They are in the form of play and curiosity from
children, and he doesn't
seem to have explored the possibility that the
behaviour that went on may have had another explanation.  So I think for all of
those
reasons unfortunately it doesn't represent a comprehensive and objective
account."</i>
<P>

49	In my opinion those considerations expressed by Dr Waters are persuasive.
<P>

50	Dr Scott was also critical of Mr Malak and made three points:
<P>

(i)	that Mr Malak's conclusion that he was certain TC had been exposed to oral
sexual acts was not the opinion a person skilled
in child sex abuse would
reach;
<P>

(ii)	that it was very unusual to reach such a confident opinion on the word of
such a young child;
<P>

(iii)	his report indicated a leading nature of questioning of the child.
<P>

51	Dr Scott regarded the Malak report as <i>"very inadequate"</i> and said she
could not place weight on his conclusions (T1870).
<P>

52	Whatever criticisms might be levelled at the quality and reliability of Mr
Malak's assessment in May 1984, Ms Goldberg's assessment
is, I find, on a
different footing.
<P>

53	Ms Goldberg had seen the plaintiff in her capacity as a clinical
psychologist in October 1982 and at that time no complaint was
made of any
sexual abuse.  However Ms Goldberg saw the plaintiff again on 12 May 1984, the
appointment having been arranged by HF's
solicitors.  HF told Ms Goldberg what
he had told Mr Malak some days before but then, whilst Ms Goldberg was testing
TC in her personality
assessment, TC behaved inappropriately as Ms Goldberg
later recorded:
<P>

	<i>"With very young children it is usual practise, as with [TC], to structure
the test as an informal game and in this instance the psychologist
was seated
on the floor with [TC] while he was looking at each card.  In this informal
unstructured context [TC] moved restlessly
around the room and although he gave
cursory responses to picture cards it was clear that none of them could hold
his attention.
 One card however did attract him.  It showed a small puppy dog
laid out on the lap of an older dog sitting on a bathtub with toilet
in the
background.</i>
<P>

<i>	[TC] seemed very interested in this card, but instead of responding to it
as requested he took the card and placed it like a bridge
over his leg and the
psychologist's knee.  He then explained that this was a bridge and that we
would have a game in which [TC] was
to call out certain instructions after the
writer asked certain questions.  The game was called `How do you get to Luna
Park' and
the writer was told to ask this question to which [TC] answered `you
go down here and up there and over to the bridge then across
the bridge and up
there---`</i>
<P>

<i>	As he chanted these directions with his finger he traced the imaginary
route up and down his own leg - across the `card' bridge over
to the writer's
knee and up the leg.  Asked to explain the purpose of the game and what he
would do when he got there [TC] replied
with growing excitement that we would
see what was inside the writer's pants.  He became quite inappropriate and
distracted at this
stage and was climbing and tugging in an aggressive way at
the writer's belt saying `take them off, take them off.'  When asked why,
he
replied `to see your dickie' - `What for' - `to see if you've got a ladies - `
and when asked what would you do then, he replied
`lick it'.  Asked if this is
something he has done before he replied `yes, it is nice'.</i>
<P>

<i>	All this with heightened excitement and reduced impulse control to a degree
that had the boy been older and bigger the scene could
resemble an
assault."</i>
<P>

54	Ms Goldberg's opinion was that TC had been sexually abused by some
experienced female person.  I quote from p 7 of her report:
<P>

	<i>"Normal psychosexual development in an advanced four year old does not
preclude an active interest in their own genitals and that
of others male and
female, child or adult and so the genital interest and preoccupation is of
itself of no significance.  Knowledge
of adult sexual practises such as
intercourse and oral sex is also not exceptional, and can be learnt from
observing or from other
children.</i>
<P>

<i>	What is both unusual and significant is the child's interest in actively
performing cunnilingus, which by itself is not directly
sexually stimulating to
the doer and therefore this sort of interest or behaviour cannot have been
incidentally learnt, and must
have been acquired through active coaching and
encouraging reward by some experienced female person, and probably one older
than
the child."</i>
<P>

55	Ms Goldberg further opined that the Luna Park game was one which TC had
probably played many times before.
<P>

56	TC told Ms Goldberg that he had played the game with <i>"Mummy and
Judith"</i>, but Ms Goldberg made it plain in her evidence that she did not
seek to determine whether TC's accusation as to the wrongdoers' identity
was
factual.
<P>

57	Ms Goldberg gave evidence before me and I accept the evidence that she gave.
There is nothing elsewhere in the evidence given
by other qualified experts in
this case which disturbs my assessment of Ms Goldberg's evidence.
<P>

58	Dr Waters, then the Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Children's
Hospital, was asked to assess HM, HF and TC in circumstances
I shall later
consider.  He carried out such assessments in September and October 1984 and
these are dealt with in the doctor's lengthy
report of 1 November 1984.  Whilst
Dr Waters did not agree with all that Ms Goldberg had to say, he did agree with
her that the way
in which TC misbehaved in her rooms indicated that <i>"at some
point"</i> the sexual activities he then engaged in had formed part of his
experience.  Dr Waters agreed that TC could not simply have been
coached to
present in that way, and he agreed that the behaviour did not reflect
<i>"normal childish sexual exploration"</i>.  Dr Waters concluded that TC had
<i>"probably been the object of at least one incident of inappropriate sexual
activity"</i>.
<P>

59	Ms Goldberg's evidence is also supported by Ms Withers and Ms Ralston; I
referred earlier to their joint conclusion in September
1984 that TC had been
exposed to adult sexual behaviour.
<P>

60	I find that TC was sexually abused by a female or females at some time or
times prior to Ms Goldberg's assessment in May 1984.
 The evidence does not
permit me to determine when or where or how often abuse took place.
<P>

61	Who was involved in such activity?
<P>

62	TC told both Ms Goldberg and Mr Malak that HM and Judith were responsible
but I am not persuaded that such evidence is reliable.
 Ms Goldberg did not
regard TC's assertion to her as to the identity of the culprits as probative
(T470-471), and I have above reviewed
the criticisms of Mr Malak's assessment,
which criticisms I regard as valid.
<P>

63	TC gave evidence in this Court, and I have not found it easy to determine
what reliance can properly be placed upon his evidence.
 TC is now a young man
eighteen years of age who was being asked to recount what had occurred to him
at the tender age of four years
or thereabouts.
<P>

64	Mr Shand called a psychologist, Ms Milne, who interviewed TC in October
1993.  TC told her at that interview that he remember
that HM and Judith had
done <i>"naughty things"</i> to him, but he gave no details.  Ms Milne said
that she perceived no inconsistencies in TC's presentation at that interview.
Ms Milne
professed no expertise in the area of <i>"recovered memory"</i> but
recognised that much care was required in assessment where memory increase
occurs from the time of initial assessment.  I have
read Ms Milne's evidence
closely but I do not find that it helps me to evaluate TC's evidence.  I add,
however, that Ms Milne said
that for the purposes of her interview with TC she
was provided with a document in TC's handwriting dealing with his recollection.
That document was tendered as Exhibit FF.  It emerged in cross examination that
Ms Milne was not provided with the complete document
that had been prepared by
TC.  The complete document had an earlier page and TC acknowledged in the
course of his evidence that the
whole document he had prepared over a couple of
days.  I set out the content of TC's document comprising both Exhibit FF and
Exhibit
5:
<P>

65	(Exhibit 5)
<P>

	<i>"I Remember...</i>
<P>

<i>	*	Ashraff beating me with a cricket bat, for being late from school.  I was
curled up into a ball between cuboard [sic] &amp; wall
&amp; bed.</i>
<P>

<i>	*	an episode where, in the care of Judice (with her watching at the time),
a male friend of Jidice asked me, with errect [sic] penis,
to enter the bath
&amp; play with him.</i>
<P>

<i>	*	I remember a doctor (Dr Waters) told me (on two seperate occations [sic])
to not say anything about Mummy that I remember</i>
<P>

<i>	*	One time I dropped a glass of milk (strawberry flavoured quick) all over
my pants.  [HM] went beserk [sic] and grabbed the nearest
thing she could get
her hands on, a hammer, and threw it at my leg.  I moved my leg, the hammer
smashed a tile and she ran at me,
took my arm (right) &amp; bit it leaving
teeth marks, with blood oozing out of some of the indentations</i>
<P>

<i>	*	I remember another time when I broke the TV (the light bulb inside blew
up).  She looked at me, her eyes very wide, then she rushed
me, took my arm
&amp; bit me.</i>
<P>

<i>	*	I remember one time at pre-school, a young friend (male) &amp; a little
girl &amp; I hid in a cubby house.  I seduced her &amp;
licked her
vagina.</i>
<P>

<i>	*	Another time a different little girl &amp; I were having a bath, with
Judice looking after us.  We licked each others genitals.
 Judice said that it
was good."</i>
<P>

(Exhibit FF)
<P>

	<i>"I remember Dr Waters giving me a biscuit and a cup of cordial and telling
me not to tell anyone the naughty things Mummy did to me.
 I also remember
sitting in a room with someone watching over me and [HM] coming in and
whispering `Tell the people that you want
to stay with Mummy or I'll kill
you.'"</i>
<P>

66	It is to be observed that the document comprised of Exhibit FF and Exhibit 5
does not contain any assertion of sexual impropriety
against HM but it does
against <i>"Judice"</i>.
<P>

67	In his oral evidence TC said that he remembered telling Mr Malak that he had
oral sex with Judith and his mother but although
that is what he told Mr Malak
he could now only clearly remember having oral sex with Judith.  He said he now
has no recollection
of doing this with his mother.
<P>

68	When asked whether he presently had a recollection of any conduct on the
part of HM of a sexual kind, TC's response was:
<P>

	<i>"I don't clearly remember any incident, although I do get </i><cite>an
impression</cite><i> that something of that nature occurred."</i>
<P>

69	TC's evidence, as I assess it, would not warrant a finding that he was
sexually abused by HM.
<P>

70	For her part, HM consistently denied being involved in the sexual abuse of
her child when she was interviewed and she again denied
any such misconduct in
the evidence that she gave in these proceedings.  Dr Waters was engaged
specifically for the purpose of assessing
TC and it was hoped that that
assessment might enable him to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators.  That
hope was not fulfilled
but eventually Dr Waters concluded that he was
<i>"certain"</i> that HM had not sexually abused her son.  He was equally
confident that HF was not involved in any activity of sexual abuse.  TC
did not
identify his mother as having done what he told Mr Malak she had done.  Dr
Waters was not, of course, in a position to assess
the issue of any wrongdoing
by Judith Curran, and that person was not called in the proceedings before this
Court.  
<P>

71	Evidence was introduced during the course of the hearing that indicated that
Judith Curran evaded service of a subpoena issued
on the defendant's initiative
in an endeavour to bring her before this Court.  I do not consider it would be
proper to draw the inference
from that evidence however that that person was
evading service through a consciousness of guilt.  It seems to me that her
reluctance
may well have been altogether innocent.
<P>

72	I am not satisfied, having reflected on all the evidence in point in this
case, that the perpetrator or perpetrators of the sexual
abuse has or have been
identified.
<P>

73	When did YACS become aware of the allegations of sexual abuse that emerged
in May 1984?
<P>

74	Mr Lungley's file note written on 22 August 1984 (Exhibit A(abp)) records
that Ms Goldberg's reports together with that of Mr
Malak were received at the
Sydney office of YACS on or about 11 July 1984.  Prior to that time of course
the Child at Risk Notification
had been received on 11 May 1984 (Exhibit
A(mmm)).  The receipt of that notification prompted the making of inquiries
about sexual
abuse in advance of the receipt of the persuasive report of Ms
Goldberg.  The nature of the response of YACS to the knowledge of
sexual abuse
that emerged and developed from May 1984 onwards is an issue I will address
later.
<P>

75	Mr Shand submitted however that I should find that YACS was on notice of
allegations of sexual abuse during the year 1983 and
in this respect he relies
in particular upon handwritten statements attributed to Mr and Mrs Blevnik.
<P>

76	Mrs Carolyn Blevnik swore an affidavit in the Family Court proceedings dated
15 August 1983.  That affidavit contained no allegations
as to any sexually
inappropriate behaviour by TC.  However a handwritten statement by her dated 2
August 1983 referred to physical
ill-treatment by HM of her son and to other
disturbing behaviour of TC.  Mrs Blevnik wrote:
<P>

	<i>"One night I was minding [TC] and he was sitting on the bed and I was lying
on the bed watching the television when he got off the
bed and took his pants
off, I thought he was going to the toilet.  He got back up and sat on top of
me, pulling his penis towards
me, touching me on the breasts and trying to
touch me down below.  He was acting out the sex act..."</i>
<P>

77	In that same statement Mrs Blevnik said that she had seen HM tongue kissing
TC.  
<P>

78	That handwritten statement found its way into evidence as part of Exhibit K
and it formed part of the material produced by the
defendant upon discovery.
Mr Shand submitted that the inference ought to be drawn that the department
became aware of that handwritten
statement at about the date which it bears.
He submitted that that inference was appropriate in the absence of any evidence
to explain
how or when YACS came into possession of that document.
<P>

79	Further Mr Shand drew attention to Mr Lungley's report, Exhibit A(xxx).  In
that document Mr Lungley recorded on p 4 inter alia:
<P>

	<i>"The allegations of sexual abuse which [HF] has been claiming occurred
since August 1983...are only substantiated insofar as [TC]
has made statements
to Greta Goldberg, psychologist, and Nabil Malak..."</i>
<P>

80	Mr Shand submitted that, whilst Mr Lungley was not called, the inference
arose from what he wrote in Exhibit A(xxx) on 31 July
1984 that YACS must have
been aware that HF had been alleging sexual abuse of TC to the knowledge of the
department as far back as
August 1983. Mr McAlary submitted to the contrary.
<P>

81	Exhibit MM is a report prepared by a YACS officer, Liz Lorschy.  It records
an interview with a Debbie Howarth who had had some
association with HF and TC.
Ms Howarth told Ms Lorschy that on an occasion <i>"around Christmas 1983"</i>
TC said to her:  <i>"Where's your dick, I want to play with it." </i> According
to Ms Howarth he also tried to put his tongue in her mouth.  That information
was not conveyed to YACS in December 1983.
 The note makes it plain that Ms
Lorschy elicited the information from Ms Howarth when she saw her in January
1985.
<P>

82	Returning to the question as to when it was that YACS became aware of the
content of the Blevnik handwritten statement, it is
plain that Mrs Burgess
learnt what Mrs Blevnik could say in an interview in August 1984.  
<P>

83	Mrs Burgess gave evidence which I accept that she did not see the Blevnik
letter dated 2 August 1983 until during the course
of the hearing in this
Court.  The Blevniks were referred to Mrs Burgess by an emergency assistance
officer on 13 August 1984.  At
that time as neighbours of HM they complained
they were being harassed and they wanted alternative accommodation away from
the Waterloo
flats where they were neighbours of HM.
<P>

84	In the course of the interview which Mrs Burgess conducted with Mr and Mrs
Blevnik, Mrs Blevnik provided information consistent
with the content of the
statement of 2 August 1983 so the evidence establishes that on 13 August 1984
YACS became aware of the substance
of the Blevnik document dated 2 August 1983.
This leaves open the question whether any other officer of YACS knew of the
Blevnik
statement of 2 August 1983 before that time.
<P>

85	I find no record in all the documents emanating from the department file
which indicates to me that YACS did receive the handwritten
Blevnik statements
at any time prior to the interview which Mrs Burgess conducted in August 1984.

<P>

86	The second August 1983 document handwritten by Mrs Blevnik carries a date of
12 August 1983.  It refers to Mrs Blevnik accompanying
her husband and HF to
the Child Abuse Prevention Centre (CAPS) and the document asserts that Mrs
Blevnik gave to a woman from YACS
a six page report which, by inference, is the
earlier handwritten document of 2 August 1983.  However the Blevniks did not
give evidence
before this Court and I am not persuaded by what Mrs Blevnik
wrote in Exhibit K on 12 August 1983 that it was an officer of YACS
to whom she
gave the six page report.  Mrs Blevnik could well have been mistaken about
this.  There is simply no indication elsewhere
in the papers as to who any such
officer may have been and the person referred to may well have been an officer
of CAPS.
<P>

87	No evidence was called from CAPS in relation to any attendance there by Mrs
Blevnik in August 1983 and no documentary material
has been produced from CAPS
either.
<P>

88	On 31 July 1984 Mr Lungley wrote a detailed report tracing the history of
YACS involvement with TC and the first specific mention
of any sexual
impropriety there recorded relates to HF's complaint to Ms Harris on 7 May
1984.  Had the Blevnik statement of August
1983 been in the department's
possession at the time Mr Lungley wrote this report, I would have expected to
find reference to it
in that document.
<P>

89	HF gave evidence that he took the Blevnik statements of 2 and 12 August 1983
to YACS, visiting both the Sydney office and the
Parramatta office for that
purpose, but I accept the submission advanced by the defendant that the conduct
of HF was not consistent
with his having copies of the statements at that time.
(The material that HF gave Mr Callaghan did not include the Blevnik
statements.)
 Mr McAlary has drawn attention to twenty occasions upon which HF
spoke to doctors or psychologists between 9 August 1983 and 16
March 1984
without referring to any allegation of sexual abuse:
<P>

(i)	on 9 August 1983 HF took TC to the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital
where Dr Falk was consulted;
<P>

(ii)	on 16 August 1983 HF contacted Ms Poppy Harris;
<P>

(iii)	on 19 August 1983 HF spoke with the court counsellor, Jill Burrett;
<P>

(iv)	on 26 August 1983 Ms Harris saw HF and TC at the hospital;
<P>

(v)	on 26 October 1983 HF saw Dr Younan with TC.  Dr Younan saw HF and TC on a
further six occasions prior to the date of his report
of 29 December 1983
(Exhibit A(ddd)).  Dr Younan conducted a further interview in January 1984 but
it was not until the last interview
in May 1984 that any concern about sexual
abuse was raised with the doctor;
<P>

(vi)	there was an attendance upon Mr Goard on 22 November 1983 and there were
further attendances on 25 November, and 2 and 9 December;
<P>

(vii)	then Mr Malak conducted interviews with TC in the presence of HF on 25
November 1983 in Mr Malak's office and subsequently
on 2 December 1983 on a
home visit without any allegation arising about sexual abuse;
<P>

(viii)	on 19 December 1983 HF arranged for TC to be seen at the Bankstown Area
Health Centre and both father and son were psychologically
assessed on that
day.  No complaint was made of sexual abuse then, and the first complaint at
the Area Health Centre of that nature,
was made on 8 May 1984;
<P>

(ix)	on 9 January 1984 HF saw Mr Ford, social worker at the Children's Hospital
at Camperdown expressing concerns about the safety
and welfare of TC.  He told
Mr Ford then that he had decided not to take TC back to HM because of the
<i>"mental abuse"</i> of TC by HM.
<P>

90	When consideration is given to the purpose of the visits above referred to,
Mr McAlary submitted that one might have expected
HF to have alerted each of
the above doctors or psychologists to the behaviour described by Mrs Blevnik if
HF was then aware of it.
 I agree.
<P>

91	Mrs Blevnik made an affidavit for the purpose of the proceedings in the
Family Court.  This affidavit was sworn on 15 August
1983, but it contains no
reference to the sexually inappropriate behaviour described in the handwritten
statement, so that the affidavit,
even had YACS been aware of its contents at
about the time it was sworn, would not have alerted the department to the
child's behaviour
not mentioned in it.
<P>

92	I have concluded that the evidence does not warrant a finding that any
officer of YACS became aware of what Mrs Blevnik wrote
in August 1983 and that
the first officer to become aware of the substance of what was then written was
Mrs Burgess on her interview
with Mrs Blevnik in August 1984.
<P>

93	Accordingly I do not find that any officer of YACS was alerted to
allegations that TC had been sexually abused or was behaving
in a sexually
inappropriate way prior to May 1984.
<P>

	<b><u>Was there a duty of care in YACS capable of founding a private</u>
</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>cause of action?</u></b>
<P>

94	This case demands consideration of questions of much complexity on the issue
of liability.  The first such question is whether
YACS owed to TC a duty of
care, the breach of which would enable TC to maintain a claim for damages.  I
have had the benefit of receiving
detailed submissions from counsel on this
issue.  I do not propose to embark upon an exhaustive review of those
submissions but I
have given them close consideration.
<P>

95	Generally speaking, the common law has not imposed a duty upon one citizen
to come to the aid of another.
<P>

96	In <i>Hargrave v Goldman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20110%20CLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 110 CLR 40</a> at 65-66 Windeyer J said,
referring to Lord Atkins' judgment in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20532" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC 532</a>
at 580-581:
<P>

	<i>"Lord Atkin's well-known generalization explains the scope of a duty of
care, that is to say it states who can complain of a lack
of care when an
obligation of care exists.  But I venture to think that it is a mistake to
treat it as providing always a complete
and conclusive test of whether, in a
given situation, one person has a legal duty either to act or to refrain from
acting in the
interests of others.  The very allusion shows that it has not
this universal application.  The priest and the Levite, when they saw
the
wounded man by the road, passed by on the other side.  He obviously was a
person whom they had in contemplation and who was closely
and directly affected
by their action.  Yet the common law does not require a man to act as the
Samaritan did.  The lawyer's question
must therefore be given a more restricted
reply than is provided by asking simply who was, or ought to have been, in
contemplation
when something is done.  The dictates of charity and of
compassion do not constitute a duty of care.  The law casts no duty upon
a man
to go to the aid of another who is in peril or distress, not caused by him.
The call of common humanity may lead him to the
rescue.  This the law
recognizes, for it gives the rescuer its protection when he answers that call.
But it does not require that
he do so.  There is no general duty to help a
neighbour whose house is on fire."</i>
<P>

97	Thirty-five years later in <i>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%2d98%5d%20192%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997-98] 192
CLR 330</a> at 368 McHugh J said:
<P>

	<i>"101.	As I pointed out in Lutz ((1988)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20NSWLR%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 NSWLR 293</a> at 326), from the time
of the Year Books, the common law has drawn a distinction between causing
damage by a positive act and `causing'
damage by a failure to act.  The early
forms of action gave no remedy for failure to prevent harm.  The writ of
trespass, historically
the most important of the early writs for remedying
wrongs, was available only for direct or forcible injury.  Not until the action
on the case was developed did the common law provide a remedy for omissions.
Initially, both contractual and tortious wrongs were
remedied by the action on
the case because the distinction betweens `rights ex contractu and ex delicto
was by no means clear' (Sutton,
Personal Actions at Common Law (1929) p 26).
When tort and contract separated, contractual wrongs came to be identified with
the
action on the case.  Speaking generally, remedies for omissions were
henceforth seen as remediable by the action in assumpsit, not
case.  Absent
consideration or its equivalent, the common law generally imposed no obligation
on a person to protect or help another.
 As Windeyer J pointed out in Hargrave
v Goldman ((1963) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=110%20CLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">110 CLR 40</a> at 66), `the common law does not require a man to
act as the Samaritan did'.  For that reason in most cases, the occupier of
property
owes no duty to a neighbour to secure the property so as to prevent
thieves gaining access to the property for the purpose of robbing
the
neighbour's premises (P Perl (Exporters) Ltd v Camden London Borough Council
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1983/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] EWCA Civ 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20QB%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] QB 342</a> at 357-8, 359-60).  The `general rule' said Dixon J in Smith v
Leurs ((1945) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=70%20CLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">70 CLR 256</a> at 262), `is that one man is under no duty of
controlling another man to prevent his doing damage to a third'.  Nor does the
common
law generally impose any duty on a person to take steps to prevent harm,
even very serious harm, befalling another.  Thus, absent
a statutory duty, a
highway authority owes no duty to motorists to improve the visibility on a
dangerous corner even though it is
aware of the danger created by the poor
visibility (Stovin v Wise  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20AC%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] AC 923).</a>  The careless or malevolent person,
who stands mute and still while another heads for disaster, generally incurs no
liability for
the damage that the latter suffers.  Harsh though the common law
may seem to be, there are nevertheless strong political, moral and
economic
arguments that justify its approach, as Lord Hoffmann pointed out in Stovin v
Wise ([1996) AC 923 at 943-4)."</i>
<P>

98	There has been no decision directly determining whether or not a private
cause of action may arise under the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> and Mr McAlary
submitted that hitherto the common law has not recognised as a category of
relationship giving rise to a private duty
of care the relationship between a
welfare worker and a child needing help.  Indeed, the House of Lords recently
had occasion to
consider the liability of a council under welfare legislation
in <i>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 633.</a>  In that
case five young plaintiffs were seeking to recover damages from the council.
They alleged by statement of claim that they
had suffered from parental neglect
and in consequence sustained personal injury.  They sued the council alleging
breach of statutory
duty and negligence.  It was pleaded that the council had
received reports of such parental abuse and neglect but had failed to
investigate
adequately or to protect the plaintiffs from further harm.
<P>

99	The statements of claim were struck out as disclosing no cause of action and
that decision was upheld in the Court of Appeal
and again in the House of
Lords.  It was held that the English legislation gave rise neither to an action
for breach of statutory
duty nor to an action for negligence.
<P>

100	In a sense therefore the plaintiff is treading fresh ground in this cause,
and the principle that there is the need to proceed
incrementally in increasing
categories of negligence is not to be ignored.  That principle was referred to
in <i>Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 157 CLR 424</a> by
Brennan J at 481 where his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"It is preferable, in my view, that the law should develop novel categories
of negligence incrementally and by analogy with established
categories, rather
than by a massive extension of a prima facie duty of care restrained only by
indefinable `considerations which
ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the
scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed.'"</i>
<P>

(See also <i>Hill v Van Erp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%2d97%5d%20188%20CLR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995-97] 188 CLR 159</a> per Dawson J at
178-179.)
<P>

101	Then in the <i>Pyrenees</i> case (supra), Kirby J (at 420) referred to
<i>"the incremental approach accepted by this court"</i>.  
<P>

102	See also the <i>Bedfordshire</i> case (supra) per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at
751, and earlier in the Court of Appeal the judgment of Peter Gibson LJ at
680.
<P>

103	In this context Mr McAlary also drew attention to a variety of situations
in which no duty of care was held to exist:
<P>

(i)	in <i>Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire</i> [1989] AC 53 the House
of Lords determined that police officers owed no general duty of care to
identify or apprehend an unknown
criminal.  It was contrary to public policy
for the police to be liable in negligence for their activities in the
investigation of
crime;
<P>

(ii)	in <i>Elguzouli-Daf v The Commissioner of Police</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] EWCA Civ 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20QB%20335" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] QB 335</a> it was
held that there was no general duty of care owed by a prosecuting authority
towards a defendant and that there were policy
considerations against the
recognition of such a duty;
<P>

(iii)	in <i>Capital and Counties PLC v Hampshire County Council</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/3091.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">(1997) EWCA Civ 3091</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20QB%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] QB
1004</a> it was held that no common law duty was imposed upon a fire brigade to
answer a call for help (see in particular the judgment of
the Court of Appeal
at pp 1026-1030).
<P>

104	A review of recent authority on the law of negligence in Australia begins
with <i>Jaensch v Coffey</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%2d85%5d%20155%20CLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984-85] 155 CLR 549.</a>  In that case Deane J
considered the interrelationship of the concepts of reasonable foreseeability
and of proximity in confining
<i>"the frontiers of negligence"</i>.  His Honour
said at 579-580:
<P>

	<i>"The notions of reasonable foreseeability and of proximity of relationship
which were enunciated in Lord Atkins' speech in Donoghue
v Stevenson are
related.  The fact that an act of one person can be reasonably foreseen as
`likely to injure' another is an indication,
and, as will be seen, sometimes an
adequate indication, that the requirement of `proximity' is satisfied.  At the
same time, the
overall proximity of the relationship between the person or
property of the plaintiff and that of the defendant or between the allegedly
negligent act and its effect may be relevant to the question whether injury to
the plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable.  Lord Atkin's
`restricted reply' to
the common lawyer's question `who is my neighbour?' was not, however, couched
in the unqualified terms of reasonable
foreseeability which would, in the
context, have served merely to provide a diversionary circuity of reasoning.
The `neighbour' requirement
(`this necessary qualification' [1932] AC at 582)
was a substantive and independent one which was deliberately and expressly
introduced
to limit or control the test of reasonable foreseeability.  As
explained and expanded in terms of `proximity' (`the relation being
so close
that the duty arises' and `so close as to create a duty': [1932] AC at 582,
599), it differed in nature from the test of
reasonable foreseeability in that
it involved both an evaluation of the closeness of the relationship and a
judgment of the legal
consequences of that evaluation."</i>
<P>

105	His Honour addressed the significance of policy considerations in a
subsequent passage at 583:
<P>

	<i>"It is not and never has been the common law that the reasonable
foreseeability of risk of injury to another automatically means that
there is a
duty to take reasonable care with regard to that risk of injury: cf. per du
Parcq LJ, Deyong v Shenburn  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1946%5d%20KB%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1946] KB 227</a>, at 233; Edwards v West Herts. Group

Reasonable foreseeability on its
own indicates no more than that such a duty of care will exist if, and to the
extent that,
it is not precluded or modified by some applicable overriding
requirement or limitation.  It is to do little more than to state a
truism to
say that the essential function of such requirements or limitations is to
confine the existence of a duty to take reasonable
care to avoid reasonably
foreseeable injury to the circumstances or classes of case in which it is the
policy of the law to admit
it.  Such overriding requirements or limitations
shape the frontiers of the common law of negligence."</i>
<P>

106	The concept of proximity has been addressed in many cases in the High Court
in recent times:  see <i>Heyman</i> (supra) and in particular the judgment of
Deane J at 497-498; <i>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%2d94%5d%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992-94] 179 CLR 520</a> at 542-543; and <i>Bryan v Maloney</i> [1995] 182 CLR
609.  In their joint judgment in that case Mason CJ, Deane J and Gaudron J said
at 617-618:
<P>

	<i>"The cases in this Court establish that a duty of care arises under the
common law of negligence of this country only where there
exists a relationship
of proximity between the parties with respect to both the relevant class of act
or omission and the relevant
kind of damage.  In more settled areas of the law
of negligence concerned with ordinary physical injury to the person or property
of a plaintiff caused by some act of the defendant, reasonable foreseeability
of such injury will commonly suffice to establish that
the facts fall into a
category which has already been recognized as involving a relationship of
proximity between the parties with
respect to such an act and such damage and
as `attracting a duty of care, the scope of which is settled' (Sutherland Shire
Council
v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR at 441, per Gibbs CJ and see also pp 495, 501;
Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge `Willemstad' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 136 CLR 529</a>, at

In contrast, the
field of liability for mere economic loss is a comparatively new and developing
area of the law of
negligence.  In that area, the question whether the
requisite relationship of proximity exists in a particular category of case is
more likely to be unresolved by previous binding authority with the consequence
that the `notion of proximity...is of vital importance
(San Sebastian Pty Ltd v
The Minister <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/68.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 68</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%20340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 340</a> at 355, per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson
JJ).  As Stephen J indicated in Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge
`Willemstad'
((1976) 136 CLR at 575), it is the `articulation', in the
different categories of case, `of circumstances which denote sufficient
proximity' with respect to the mere economic loss, including `policy
considerations', which will gradually provide `a body of precedent
productive
of the necessary certainty'.  Inevitably, the policy considerations which are
legitimately taken into account in determining
whether sufficient proximity
exists in a novel category will be influenced by the courts' assessment of
community standards and demands
(see, e.g. Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd v Heller
&amp; Partners Ltd <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465</a> at 536; Dorset Yacht Co. v Home Office <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970]

(1985)
157 CLR at 497)."</i>
<P>

107	More recently there have been reservations expressed as to the usefulness
of proximity as a guiding principle:  see, for instance,
<i>Hill v Van Erp</i>
(supra) and the judgment of Gummow J at 237-238; <i>Pyrenees</i> (supra) per
Kirby J at 215; <i>Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern
Territory</i> [1998] 72 ALJR 208 per Gaudron J at 222 (and the dicta in other
cases there referred to); the discussion by Mason P in <i>W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills
(Aust.) Ltd v SRA</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%2043%20NSWLR%20338" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 43 NSWLR 338</a> at 350-351; and the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in <i>Hyde v Agar &amp; Ors</i> (unreported, 19 October 1998,
at pp 55-56).
<P>

108	<i>Pyrenees</i> is notable as marking, in the decisions of the majority of
the court, the abandonment of "general reliance" as a determinant of the
existence of a duty of care.
<P>

109	Whatever be the shortcomings of the concept of proximity, it remains, as I
understand the modern authorities, a touchstone for
determining whether there
exists in a particular situation a relationship that gives rise to a duty of
care.  In <i>Hill v Van Erp</i> (supra) Dawson J, in addressing the usefulness
of proximity (at 178-179) said:
<P>

	<i>"Reasonable foreseeability of harm does not, of itself, always give rise to
a duty to take care.  Something more is required according
to the category of
the case in question, and that something more is called proximity.  Where a new
category is suggested, regard
should be had in the first place to the
established categories which may be helpful by way of analogy in determining
whether to recognise
a duty of care.  That is how incremental development takes
place (see Dorset Yacht Co v Home Office <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] AC 1004</a> at 1058-1059, per Lord
Diplock).  The process is affected by relevant policy considerations, such as
the need to avoid indeterminate
liability of the placing of impediments in the
way of ordinary commercial activity.  It is also important that the tort of
negligence
should not be regarded as providing an all-enveloping remedy,
supplanting `other torts, contractual obligations, statutory duties
or
equitable rules in relation to every kind of damage including economic loss'
(see Downsview Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993]
AC 295 at 316).  In the
end, policy considerations will set the outer limits of the tort."</i>
<P>

110	In <i>Caparo Industries v Dickman</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 AC 605</a>, in the context of
considering the responsibility of an auditor with statutory duties, Lord Bridge
of Harwich (having identified
a number of decisions since <i>Anns v Merton
London Borough Council</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 728)</a> said at 617-618:
<P>

	<i>"What emerges is that, in addition to the foreseeability of damage,
necessary ingredients in any situation giving rise to a duty of
care are that
there should exist between the party owing the duty and the party to whom it is
owed a relationship characterised by
the law as one in which the court
considers it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of a
given scope upon
the one party for the benefit of the other.  But it is
implicit in the passages referred to that the concepts of proximity and
fairness
embodied in these additional ingredients are not susceptible of any
such precise definition as would be necessary to give them utility
as practical
tests, but amount in effect to little more than convenient labels to attach to
the features of different specific situations
which, on a detailed examination
of all the circumstances, the law recognises pragmatically as giving rise to a
duty of care of a
given scope."</i>
<P>

111	Whether the concept of "fairness, justice and reasonableness" is to be
regarded as an element of proximity or as a third discrete
element of criteria
for determining the existence of a duty of care, probably matters not.  Toohey
J in <i>Pyrenees</i> at 360-361[76] regarded the concept as embraced in the
notion of proximity whereas Kirby J recognised the concept as a third element
when in <i>Pyrenees</i> (at 419-420) he adopted the three stage test in
<i>Caparo</i>:
<P>

	<i>"I would therefore adopt as the approach to be taken in Australia the
three-stage test expressed by the House of Lords in Caparo.
 To decide whether
a legal duty of care exists the decision-maker must ask three questions:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.  Was it reasonably foreseeable to the alleged wrong-doer that particular
conduct or an omission on its part would be likely to
cause harm to the person
who has suffered damage or a person in the same position? (Australian Safeway
Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna 
<a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a> at 488;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20ALR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 ALR 615</a> applying

<P>

<i>	2.  Does there exist between the alleged wrong-doer and such person a
relationship characterised by the law as one of `proximity'
or `neighbourhood'?
(Whereas some authorities treat proximity and foreseeability as substantially
synonymous, the differentiation
reflects the long history of the common law in
which foreseeability of the risk of harm to another is insufficient of itself
to impose
a legal duty to act to avoid consequences to that other; cf McHugh,
`Neighbourhood, Proximity and Reliance' in Finn (ed) Essays on
Torts (1989) 5
at 17.)</i>
<P>

<i>	3.  If so, is it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a
duty of a given scope upon the alleged wrong-doer for the
benefit of such
person? (This tripartite test is to be preferred to simplistic tests which
impose undue work to be done by the notions
of proximity and foreseeabillity;
cf Dugdale, `Public Authority Liability:  To What Standard'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%202%20Tort%20Law%20Review%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 2 Tort Law
Review 143</a> at 156.)"</i>
<P>

112	Mr Shand placed much reliance upon the <i>Pyrenees case</i>, one of four
recent decisions concerning the liability of local councils with statutory
powers to which he referred.  The other cases
cited in this connection were
<i>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</i> (supra), <i>Parramatta City Council v
Lutz</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%2012%20NSWLR%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 12 NSWLR 293</a> and <i>Avenhouse v Hornsby Shire Council</i>
(unreported, NSWCA, 15 May 1988).
<P>

113	Whilst each of these four cases concerned the relationship of a council to
a party with an interest in property within the confines
of the council's
geographic area, Mr Shand submitted that the decisions in these cases, in
particular those in <i>Heyman</i> and <i>Pyrenees, </i>were more far reaching.
He submitted that <i>Pyrenees</i> stands as general authority for the way in
which a private right of action may arise from the terms of a statute and the
claimant's
membership of a class which the statute is intended to protect.  I
accept that to be so.  The decision also illustrates that foreseeability,
proximity and policy considerations play their role in determining whether a
cause of action can arise in a statutory setting.
<P>

114	In <i>Pyrenees</i>, the Council was found to owe a duty of care to property
owners whose premises were damaged by fire.  The council had inspected the
chimney in one of two adjacent properties and had found it to be defective.  It
directed the then occupier of the relevant premises
not to use the fireplace
until it was repaired but the council then failed to follow the matter up.  The
subsequent occupier used
the fireplace unaware of the council's direction and
fire damaged each of the two properties.  The relevant statutory provision was
s 695(1A) of the Victorian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a>:
<P>

	<i>"For the purpose of preventing fires the owner or occupier of any land upon
which is erected any chimney or fire-place which is constructed
of inflammable
material or which is not adequately protected so as to prevent an ignition of
other adjacent material of an inflammable
nature may by notice in writing be
directed by the counsel of the municipality within the municipal district of
which such land is
situated to alter the fire-place or chimney so as to make it
safe for use as a fireplace or chimney, as the case may be."</i>
<P>

115	Each of the judges in this case gave separate judgments with Toohey and
McHugh JJ dissenting from the majority view that the
concept of general
reliance had no role to play in determining whether a duty of care was owed.  A
consideration of the various decisions
in this case however emphasises the
importance of the terms of the statute in determining whether it can give rise
to a private cause
of action.
<P>

116	I do not propose to here review in close detail what was said in
<i>Pyrenees</i> but in the course of his judgment the Chief Justice said at p
347:
<P>

	<i>[24]	Thus a duty to exercise a power may arise from particular
circumstances, and may be enforceable by a public law remedy.  Where
a purpose
for which a power is conferred is the protection of the person or property of a
class of individuals and the circumstances
are such that the repository of the
power is under a public law duty to exercise the power, the duty is, or in
relevant respects
is analogous to, a statutory duty imposed for the benefit of
a class, breach of which gives rise to an action for damages by a member
of the
class who suffers loss in consequence of a failure to discharge the duty.  The
general principles of public law establish
the existence of the statutory duty
to exercise the power and the statute prescribes the class of individuals for
whose benefit the
power is to be exercised.</i>
<P>

<i>	[25]	Where the power is a power to control `conduct or activities which may
foreseeably give rise to a risk of harm to an individual'
(to use a criterion
stated by McHugh JA in Parramatta City Council v Lutz  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%2012%20NSWLR%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 12 NSWLR 293</a> at
328) and the power is conferred for the purpose of avoiding such a risk, the
awarding of compensation for loss caused by a failure
to exercise the power
when there is a duty to do so is in accordance with the policy of the statute.
An individual who is among the
class whose interests are intended to be
protected by exercise of the power has both locus standi to seek a public law
remedy (Onus

<P>

117	Gummow J emphasised at p 377 [126] <i>"the primary requirement of analysis
of any legislation which is in point and the positions occupied by the parties
on the facts as
found at trial"</i>.  His Honour later went on (p 388 [166]) to
identify three general propositions of importance, citing the judgment of Dixon
J in
<i>Shaw Savill and Albion Co Ltd v Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1940/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%2066%20CLR%20344" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] 66 CLR 344:</a>
<P>

	<i>(i)	"The obligation of due care to avoid harm to others, though a general
duty arises out of the situation occupied by the person
incurring it or the
circumstances in which he is placed."</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	"Where what is alleged against [the defendant] is failure to fulfil an
obligation of care, the character in which he acted,
together, no doubt, with
the nature of the duties he was in the course of performing, may determine the
extent of the duty of care."</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	"In the application of the other propositions, regard is to be had
both `to reason and to policy'".</i>
<P>

118	Later still at p 391-392 [177] his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"The general rule is that `when statutory powers are conferred they must be
exercised with reasonable care, so that if those who exercise
them could by
reasonable precaution have prevented an injury which has been occasioned, and
was likely to be occasioned, by their
exercise, damages for negligence may be
recovered" (Caledonian Collieries Ltd v Speirs <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1957/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2097%20CLR%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 97 CLR 202</a> at 220;

1).</a>  A public authority which enters upon the exercise of statutory powers with
respect to a particular subject matter may place itself
in a relationship to
others which imports a common law duty to take care which is to be discharged
by the continuation or additional
exercise of those powers (Sutherland Shire
Council v Heyman <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 424</a> at 459-60; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=60%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">60 ALR 1).</a>  Any absence of
further exercise of the interconnected statutory powers may be difficult to
separate from the exercise which has
already occurred and that exercise may
then be said to have been performed negligently (cf Sutherland Shire Council v

<P>

<i>119	</i>I referred earlier to the approach of Kirby J in adopting the three
stage test in <i>Caparo</i>.  In considering the third stage his Honour
addressed policy considerations (see paras 249-253 of his Honour's
judgment).
<P>

<i>120	</i>McHugh J did not consider it was reasonable for those interested in
the premises in which the defective chimney was located and from
which the fire
spread to take advantage of the general reliance doctrine against the council
and considered therefore that no duty
of care was owed to those parties.
However, his Honour did say at p 373 [119]:
<P>

<i>	"I fully accept that the circumstances may require a power such as that
conferred by s 695 (1A) to be exercised and that the failure
to exercise the
power may give rise to a breach of duty under the statute and to an action for
damages at common law..."</i>
<P>

121	I turn now to consider the provisions of the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> of
1939.  Whilst this Act was later repealed, it is common ground that this was
the governing statute for the period with which this
cause is concerned,
because it was the governing statute for so long as HM had the care of TC.
<P>

122	Part II identifies the authority responsible for the administration of the
Act.  The Act empowered the appointment of a Director
as the permanent head of
the Department of Youth and Community Services and <i>"such other officers and
employees as are necessary for the administration of this Act"</i> (s 5).  It
made provision for the Minister to become the guardian of any young person who
became a ward (s 9) and charged the Minister
with the care of all wards except
in periods defined in s 10.  Section 10A empowered the Minister to delegate to
any specified officer
of YACS the exercise or performance <i>"of such of the
powers, authorities, duties or functions conferred"</i> under the Act.
<P>

123	Part III provided for the establishment of Children's Courts.
<P>

124	Part IV provided for the establishment of depots, homes and hospitals.
<P>

125	Part V defined the Minister as being the authority to admit a child to
State control and thereafter to make any of the provisions
contemplated in s 23
in relation to such a child.  These included providing for his accommodation
and maintenance, the payment of
foster parents, the boarding out of a ward and
the approval of people applying for custody of wards.
<P>

126	Part VI empowered the Minister to grant allowances for the support of
destitute children and young people in the circumstances
identified in that
Part.
<P>

127	Part VII provided for the licensing of child care centres, children's
depots, homes and hostels and private foster homes.
<P>

128	Part VIII concerned lying-in homes, that is homes where women were received
for confinement.
<P>

129	Part IX made certain provisions for intellectually handicapped persons.
<P>

130	There is no need for present purposes to refer to any of the detail of
Parts VII, VIII or IX.
<P>

131	Part X provided for the establishment of institutions and schools for young
persons and for them to be controlled by the Minister
(ss 49 and 50).  Sections
53 and 54 empowered the Minister to determine in what particular institution a
child might be placed and
to make decisions for the transfer of a child from
one place to another and for the discharge of a child from an institution and
to restore the child to the custody of his parent or some other suitable
person.
<P>

132	Part XI was concerned with the punishment of inmates in institutions and
does not call for examination here.
<P>

133	Neither do Parts XII or XIII which deal with the maintenance of children by
their relatives and the employment of children.
<P>

134	Part XIV made provision for the committal inter alia of neglected children.
Section 72 defined a <i>"neglected child"</i> as including a child:
<P>

	<i>"(d)	who...is ill-treated or exposed...</i>
<P>

<i>	(j)	who, in the opinion of the court, is under incompetent or improper
guardianship...</i>
<P>

<i>	(n)	who is falling into bad associations or is exposed to moral
danger..."</i>
<P>

135	Section 73 empowered a justice <i>"upon oath being made before him by an
officer authorised by the Minister in that behalf..."</i> to summons any child
to appear before the court if, after due inquiry, he believes that child to be
neglected.
<P>

136	Section 74 empowered any officer authorised by the Minister to apprehend a
child for whose apprehension a warrant had been issued
under s 73, even if that
person did not have the warrant in his possession.
<P>

137	Section 78 provided that where a child had been apprehended as a neglected
child he was to be taken to a shelter and thereafter
brought before the court
as soon as practicable.
<P>

138	Section 81 dealt with the procedure when the child was brought before the
court.  This section and ss 82 and 83 which concern
the powers of the court do
not require close reference at this particular point although I will return to
them later when addressing
the negligence alleged against the defendant in
failing to bring TC before the Children's Court.
<P>

139	It is appropriate to pass now to Part XVII of the Act.  Section 148 created
offences for those who neglected to provide for
children in their care and s
149 created offences for those who assaulted or ill-treated children.  Section
132 provided for the
maximum penalties to be imposed upon those guilty of
offences under the Act which were punishable summarily.
<P>

140	Under s 135 any officer authorised by the Minister or a police officer was
empowered to take a child in respect of whom it was
believed that an offence
had been committed to a shelter where he could be detained until brought before
a court.
<P>

141	Under s 146 any person might lay an information before a magistrate upon
which the magistrate who believed there was reasonable
cause to suspect that a
child was a neglected child as defined might issue a warrant for the purpose of
having the child taken to
a place of safety until he could be brought before a
court.
<P>

142	Section 148B provided for a statutory scheme of notification of the
Director and this provision assumes particular significance
in the present
context.  It defined, in sub-s (1), a <i>"prescribed person"</i> as meaning:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	a medical practitioner; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a person who is a member of any class of persons prescribed for the
purposes of this paragraph, being a person who follows a
profession, calling or
vocation, other than a solicitor or barrister in the course of his profession,
so prescribed, or who holds
any office so prescribed."</i>
<P>

143	Section (2) provided for notification by those other than prescribed
persons:
<P>

	<i>"(2)	Any person who forms the belief upon reasonable grounds that a child
-</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	has been assaulted; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	is a neglected child within the meaning of Part XIV</i>
<P>

<i>	may</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	notify the Director of his belief and the grounds thereof either orally
or in writing; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	cause the Director to be so notified."</i>
<P>

144	Sub-section (3) imposed an obligation of notification on prescribed persons
and sub-s (4) provided for a penalty for breach
of this obligation:
<P>

	<i>"(3)	A prescribed person who in the course of practising his profession,
calling or vocation, or in exercising the functions of his
office, as the case
may be, has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child has been assaulted,
ill-treated or exposed, shall -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	notify the Director of the name or a description of the child and those
grounds either orally or in writing; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	cause the Director to be so notified promptly after those grounds
arise.</i>
<P>

<i>	(4)	A prescribed person who fails to comply with sub-section (3) shall be
guilty of an offence against this Act."</i>
<P>

145	Sub-section (5) concerned the Director:
<P>

	<i>"(5)	Where the Director has been notified under sub-section (2) or (3) he
shall -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	promptly cause an investigation to be made into the matters notified to
him; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	if he is satisfied that the child in respect of whom he was notified
may have been assaulted, ill-treated or exposed, take such
action as he
believes appropriate, which may include reporting those matters to a constable
of police."</i>
<P>

146	Section 148C provided machinery for the Director or a constable of police
to have a medical examination of a child where it
was believed on reasonable
grounds that the child had suffered injury by reason of having been assaulted
or ill-treated.
<P>

147	Section 158 was referred to earlier as being a section relied upon in the
defence pleaded.  This section provided, in sub-s
(1):
<P>

	<i>"(1)	No suit or action shall lie against the Minister or any officer or
employee of the Department of Youth and Community Services
for or on account of
any act, matter or thing done or commanded to be done by him and purporting to
be done for the purpose of carrying
out the provisions of this Act, if the
Minister or the officer or employee has acted in good faith and with reasonable
care.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	[Repealed].</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)	Proceedings in such suit or action as aforesaid may, on application to
the court in which such suit or action was commenced,
be stayed upon such terms
as to costs or otherwise as the court may think fit, if the court is satisfied
that there is no reasonable
ground for alleging want of good faith or
reasonable care."</i>
<P>

148	Section 148B was added to the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> by Act No. 29 of
1977 and it was plainly added in the interests of children with a need for
protection, as the Second Reading Speech
by the then Minister for Youth and
Community Services emphasised:
<P>

	<i>"The main object of this legislation is to ensure that children who are ill
treated or abused by their parents receive prompt attention,
that parents be
provided with access to professional help at the earliest possible moment and
that such cases be systematically identified..."</i>
<P>

149	The procedure of notification to the director was made available for any
person forming the belief addressed in sub-s (2), but
the procedure of
notification was made compulsory in the case of a prescribed person coming
within sub-s (3).
<P>

150	Once a notification was given to the director, s 148B(5) was enlivened and
he thereupon became obliged to promptly cause an
investigation into the subject
matter of the notification.  Moreover, if the director was satisfied that the
child the subject of
the notification <i>"may have been assaulted, ill treated
or exposed"</i>, he became obliged to take such action as he believed
appropriate, which may include reporting those matters to a constable of
police.
<P>

151	It is to be observed that the need to cause a prompt investigation was
mandatory, as was the need to act if investigation satisfied
the director the
child may have been assaulted, ill treated or exposed but the action the
director was then to take involved an element
of discretion.
<P>

152	That the director had a discretion concerning the action he was obliged to
take, if satisfied of the possibility of assault
or ill treatment or exposure,
did not of itself preclude the existence of a common law duty of care.  Indeed,
there are statements
to the contrary to be found in <i>Pyrenees</i>.  In his
judgment in that case Brennan CJ said at 346 [23]:
<P>

	<i>"But the existence of a discretion to exercise a power is not necessarily
inconsistent with a duty to exercise it.  As Earl Cairns
LC said in Julius v
Lord Bishop of Oxford  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%205%20AC%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 5 App Cas 214</a> at 222-3:</i>
<P>

<i>	[t]here may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to be done,
something in the object for which it is to be done, something
in the conditions
under which it is to be done, something in the title of the person or persons
for whose benefit the power is to
be exercised, which may couple the power with
a duty, and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed, to
exercise
that power when called upon to do so.</i>
<P>

<i>	In Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ([1968] AC 997 at
1033), Lord Reid cited this passage and proceeded:</i>
<P>

<i>	Lord Penzance said that the true question was whether regard being had to
the person enabled, to the subject matter, to be general
objects of the statute
and to the person or class of persons for whose benefit the power was intended
to be conferred, the words
do or do not create a duty ((1880) 5 App Cas 214 at
229-30), and Lord Selborne said that the question was whether it could be shown
from any particular words in the Act or from the general scope and objects of
the statute that there was a duty ((1880) 5 App Cas
214 at 235).  So there is
ample authority for going behind the words which confer the power to the
general scope and objects of the
Act in order to find what was
intended."</i>
<P>

153	McHugh J in his judgment said at 371 [110]:
<P>

	<i>"There is nothing novel in the proposition that, despite the conferment of
a discretionary power, particular circumstances may require
the power to be
exercised.  To hold that the existence of the power can give rise to a common
law duty to take reasonable care to
exercise it is therefore not inconsistent
with the existence of the discretion."</i>
<P>

154	Gummow J, at p 376 [124], referred to <i>Heyman</i>, saying:
<P>

	<i>"Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman established that the circumstance that a
public authority is the repository of a statutory discretion
does not prevent
the application of the ordinary principles of the law of negligence."</i>
<P>

155	The fact that s 695(1A) conferred a discretionary power upon the council in
<i>Pyrenees</i> did not preclude the existence of a breach of duty giving rise
to a claim for damages in that case.  Indeed, in that case Gummow
J, having
acknowledged the defendant's statutory powers, said at 389 [168]:
<P>

	<i>"This statutory enablement of the shire `facilitate[d] the existence of a
common law duty of care', [again citing Heyman] but the
touchstone of what I
would hold to be its duty was the shire's measure of control of the situation,
including its knowledge."</i>
<P>

156	In Kirby J's analysis in <i>Pyrenees</i> at p 427-428 [255], the law did
impose a duty of care on the shire for the benefit of the Days:
<P>

	<i>"The scope of the duty was to oblige the shire to consider and effectively
to exercise the powers which it had under s 695(1A) of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government
Act</a>.  It also required the shire to follow up action under that
sub-section."</i>
<P>

157	It is not contended in the present case of course that the <i>Child Welfare
Act</i> gave rise to a statutory cause of action.  However, the absence of a
statutory cause of action does not prevent the creation of a
common law duty of
care.  Indeed, <i>Pyrenees</i> is itself illustrative of this, and see the
judgment of Kirby J at 422 [250].  See also the judgment of Mason J in
<i>Heyman</i> (supra) at 459.
<P>

158	I am satisfied that this legislation, and in particular s 148B, was
introduced for the protection of a limited class, namely
children at risk.  I
find no pointer in the statute that parliament did not intend to create a
source of a private cause of action.
 Indeed, s 158 may be regarded as an
indicator that parliament intended that a private duty could arise under the
statute.
<P>

159	Section 158 was in the Act prior to the addition of s 148B.  It was amended
however by Act No. 19 of 1977, the <i>Notice of Action and Other Privileges
Abolition Act</i>.  That Act, as its title indicates, addressed limitation
provisions then to be found in many acts.  It repealed s 158(2) which had
required any action to be commenced within six months <i>"after the alleged
cause of action"</i>, and it amended s 158(3), again by eliminating the six
month limitation period referred to therein.  Hence this Act removed
restrictions
formerly affecting a remedy contemplated by s 158(1).
<P>

160	Section 158 was considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>Minister for Youth
and Community Services v Health and Research Employees Association</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%2010%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987]
10 NSWLR 543.</a>  It is unnecessary to refer to the facts in that case, far
removed from those presently under consideration.  However, McHugh JA
said of
the section at 561:
<P>

	<i>"Section 158 in my opinion is directed to suits or actions in tort or in
quasi contract type situations such as actions for money
had and received and
so on."</i>
<P>

161	I respectfully adopt the analysis of s 158 expressed by McHugh JA, as he
then was.  Section 158 contemplated that liability
could arise in tort 
<P>

	<i>"for or on account of any act, matter or thing done or commanded to be
done...and purporting to be done for the purpose of carrying
out the provisions
of this Act..."</i>
<P>

162	Mr McAlary acknowledged that the section could have work to do after
intervention by the defendant and the removal of a child
from his former
environment, but submitted that the presence of s 158 was entirely consistent
with the absence of any tortious exposure
before intervention of that
nature.
<P>

163	Upon reflection I am not attracted by that submission.  Under s 148B an
obligation to act was triggered by notification, which
notification imposed
mandatory requirements.  It follows that what was done in response to any
notification was contemplated by s
158, whether a decision to remove the child
was implemented or not.  It seems to me that viewing s 148B in conjunction with
s 158,
the latter section had possible application even as early as the
investigation stage referred to in s 148B(5)(a).
<P>

164	I observe that s 148B(5) had no real counterpart in the legislation
considered in the <i>Bedfordshire</i> case, in which case Lord
Browne-Wilkinson, with whose speech the other members of the House of Lords
agreed, observed at 739:
<P>

	<i>"...the question whether there is such a common law duty and if so its
ambit, must be profoundly influenced by the statutory framework
within which
the acts complained of were done."</i>
<P>

165	Against the above background and with the provisions of the Act in mind, I
now approach the task of determining whether in the
present case the defendant
owed to the plaintiff a duty of care at common law.  I do so adopting, with
respect, the three stage approach
employed by Kirby J in <i>Pyrenees</i> (see
para 111 above).
<P>

166	Following the introduction of s 148B into the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> in
1977 the defendant introduced a set of instructions which became Exhibit L:
<P>

	<i>"In conjunction with recent legislation it is proposed to establish a
Central Index of cases of child abuse known to or notified to
the Department,
in the Child Life Protection Unit being established.</i>
<P>

<i>	The basis for this central index will be the cases previously referred to
the Stanmore District Office under existing circular instructions,
plus other
cases known to the Department and under supervision, but not previously
notified to Stanmore.</i>
<P>

<i>	It will therefore be necessary to immediately review all current Family
Casework Files (and any appropriate Local Files) and to extract
appropriate
data from these case records. It is proposed that this task be shared between
Field staff and Specialist Child Abuse
personnel.</i>
<P>

<i>	The cases concerned are those which fall within the following definition
-</i>
<P>

<i>	`Any child under the age of 16 years who has sustained non accidental
injury as a result of actions on the part of a parent having
his or her care,
these actions usually being associated with a degree of violence on the part of
such a person.'"</i>
<P>

167	On a further sheet of Exhibit L there was recorded the following concerning
notification procedure:
<P>

	<i>"The notification procedures establish the basis for intake, assessment,
case planning and management, and review.  These procedures
are important to
the safety of the child; and they aim to give additional protection to the
children through the Central Register.</i>
<P>

<i>	All cases of suspected child abuse and neglect which come to the notice of
a Departmental Officer </i><cite>MUST</cite><i> be officially notified to the
Montrose Family Crisis Service.</i>
<P>

<i>	At the time of notification a Departmental Officer is nominated as Case
Co-ordinator.  He/she is responsible for ensuring that action
to obtain
assessment is taken.</i>
<P>

<i>	Assessment is a critical process in the management of child protection
cases.  Poor or inadequate assessment may:</i>
<P>

<i>	-	lead to an insufficient response to the family which, in turn, might more
likely result in failure to take such action or offer
such assistance as may be
needed to help those caregivers responsible for the `at risk' child, to avoid
situations where further
injury or neglect occurs;</i>
<P>

<i>	-	result in continued involvement of officers that is wasteful of scarce
resources of the Department, and an unnecessary invasion
of family privacy,
when intervention is not justified; or</i>
<P>

<i>	-	result in unnecessary and wasteful contention between the professionals
and other service deliverers involved in the case.</i>
<P>

<i>	An initial assessment must take place as soon as possible after initial
notification.  Further assessment, however, needs to canvass
all the relevant
issues outlined in Form 2; not necessarily in one or even two interviews.  The
Form is not a substitute for a thorough
written assessment."</i>
<P>

168	The content of Exhibit L has obvious relevance when considering questions
of foreseeability and proximity.
<P>

169	I am satisfied that the requirement of reasonable foreseeability has been
proved in this case.  It is plain that it was reasonably
foreseeable that any
failure by YACS to respond appropriately to a notification under s 148B could
result in harm to the child concerned.
 A statutory notification inevitably
alerted YACS to the risk of harm.
<P>

170	I am also satisfied that the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> created the necessary
proximity for a duty of care to arise.  The statutory scheme established a
particular relationship once a notification
under s 148B was received, thereby
imposing the mandatory requirements upon the director earlier considered.  The
vulnerability of
a young child considered to be at risk is self evident.
<P>

171	Is it fair, just and reasonable that the common law should impose a duty of
care upon the defendant for the benefit of the plaintiff?
<P>

172	This, of course, calls for attention to policy considerations and it is
convenient to return to the <i>Bedfordshire</i> case where Lord
Browne-Wilkinson addressed this very issue at 749-751:
<P>

	<i>"Is it, then, just and reasonable to superimpose a common law duty of care
on the local authority in relation to the performance of
its statutory duties
to protect children?  In my judgment it is not.  Sir Thomas Bingham MR took the
view, with which I agree, that
the public policy consideration which has first
claim on the loyalty of the court is that wrongs should be remedied and that
very
potent counter considerations are required to override that policy ante,
p. 663C-D.  However, in my judgment there are such considerations
in this
case.</i>
<P>

<i>	First, in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole
statutory system set up for the protection of children
at risk.  As a result of
the ministerial directions contained in `Working Together' the protection of
such children is not the exclusive
territory of the local authority's social
services.  The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the
police,
educational bodies, doctors and others.  At all stages the system
involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions.
 The key
organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi-disciplinary body
which decides whether to place the child on the
Child Protection Register.
This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is
good practice, but because
it is required by guidance, having statutory force
binding on the local authority.  The guidance is extremely detailed and
extensive:
the current edition of `Working Together' runs to 126 pages.  To
introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable
against only
one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair.  To impose such
liability on all the participant bodies would
lead to almost impossible
problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both
primary and by way of contribution,
of each for reaching a decision found to be
negligent.</i>
<P>

<i>	Second, the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with
children at risk is extraordinarily delicate.  Legislation
requires the local
authority to have regard not only to the physical wellbeing of the child but
also to the advantages of not disrupting
the child's family environment: see,
for example, section 17 of the Act of 1989.  In one of the child abuse cases,
the local authority
is blamed for removing the child precipitately: in the
other, for failing to remove the children from their mother.  As the Report
of
the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987 (Cm. 412) said, at p.244:</i>
<P>

<i>	`It is a delicate and difficult line to read between taking action too soon
and not taking it soon enough.  Social services whilst
putting the needs of the
child first must respect the rights of the parents; they also must work if
possible with the parents for
the benefit of the children.  These parents
themselves are often in need of help.  Inevitably a degree of conflict develops
between
those objectives.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Next, if a liability in damages were to be imposed, it might well be that
local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive
approach to their
duties.  For example, as the Cleveland Report makes clear, on occasions the
speedy decision to remove the child
is sometimes vital.  If the authority is to
be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child (such
negligence
lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations)
there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such
a decision
until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete
facts.  Not only would the child in fact being
abused be prejudiced by such
delay: the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would
reduce the time available
to deal with other cases and other children.</i>
<P>

<i>	The relationship between the social worker and the child's parents is
frequently one of conflict, the parent wishing to retain care
of the child, the
social worker having to consider whether to remove it.  This is fertile ground
in which to breed ill feeling and
litigation, often hopeless, the cost of which
both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the
performance of
the social service for which they were provided.  The spectre of
vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not
imposing a
legal duty.  But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the
risk a very high one which cannot be ignored.</i>
<P>

<i>	If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system
for the protection of children, it would provide substantial
argument for
imposing a duty of care.  But the statutory complaints procedures contained in
section 76 of the Act of 1980 and the
much fuller procedures now available
under the Act of 1989 provide a means to have grievances investigated, though
not to recover
compensation.  Further, it was submitted (and not controverted)
that the local authorities Ombudsman would have power to investigate
cases such
as these."</i>
<P>

173	It is to be observed that his Lordship regarded the public policy
consideration as having first claim on the loyalty of the
courts was that
wrongs should be remedied.
<P>

174	It is further to be observed that the first of the <i>"very potent counter
considerations"</i> to the imposition of a duty of care identified by his
Lordship was a statutory scheme which is not to be found in the <i>Child
Welfare Act</i> in this State.
<P>

175	It seems to me that the weight to be attached to the remaining factors
identified by his Lordship is tempered, when considering
their application to
the Director's statutory obligations under s 148B(5), by the mandatory nature
of those obligations.
<P>

176	As to the last of the counter considerations addressed in the above speech,
I observe that the only possible remedies in the
event of a public authority
declining to exercise its power or to perform its function in New South Wales
would be mandamus and resort
to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/oa114/" class="autolink_findacts">Ombudsman Act</a></i>.  There are obvious
limitations in the nature of the relief that would be available by resort to
either of these avenues.
<P>

177	Mr McAlary drew attention to a number of cases in which <i>Bedfordshire</i>
was applied in England:<i> Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20WLR%20628" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997]
3 WLR 628</a>; <i>O'Rourke v Camden London Borough Council</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] UKHL 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 188</a>;
<i>Harris v Evans</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/709.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] EWCA Civ 709</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%201285" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 1285</a>; <i>W v Essex County Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%203%20WLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998]
3 WLR 534.</a>  However, once again in each of these cases the legislation differed
from the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> significantly and it would not be useful to
refer to the detail of those cases for the purposes of this judgment.
<P>

178	Mr McAlary also referred to a decision in South Australia where
<i>Bedfordshire </i>was applied:  <i>Hillman v Black</i>, a decision of Duggan
J at first instance (unreported) and of the Full Court on appeal ([1996] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1996/6275.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] SASC 5941</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=67%20SASR%20490" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">67
SASR 490).</a>  <i>Hillman</i> was a very different case from the present.  It was
held there that no duty of care was owed to the parent by the Department of
Community
Welfare under South Australian legislation following upon an
accusation that a father had sexually abused his daughter.  Once again
the
legislation in South Australia differs in what I perceive to be significant
respects from the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> with which the present case is
concerned.
<P>

179	I was also referred to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in
Victoria in <i>Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee v Crimmins</i>
(unreported) in which the Victorian Court of Appeal decided that a stevedoring
authority vested with statutory powers had no duty
of care to a waterside
worker injured through the inhalation of asbestos fibres.  Here again of
central importance to the decision
was the statutory framework upon which the
plaintiff sought to rely and it bore no resemblance to the statute with which I
am concerned.
<P>

180	Ultimately therefore I have not been much assisted by consideration of the
above cases decided since the <i>Bedfordshire </i>case.
<P>

181	My attention has also been drawn to a recent decision of the Court of
Appeal in New Zealand in <i>Attorney General v Prince and Gardner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20NZLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1
NZLR 262.</a>  In that case the plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of social
welfare officers in the failure to properly investigate a complaint
concerning
his ill treatment that had been made under the <i>Children and Young Persons
Act</i>, 1974.  The Court of Appeal (by majority, with Henry J dissenting)
determined that the claim should not be struck out but that it
ought to proceed
to trial.
<P>

182	Under s 5 of the New Zealand statute the obligation was imposed upon the
Director General in these terms:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	It shall be the duty of the Director-General to take positive action
and such steps under this Act as in his opinion may assist
in preventing
children or young persons from being exposed to unnecessary suffering or
deprivation or from becoming seriously disturbed
or from committing
offences.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	In pursuance of the duty imposed on him by subsection (1) of this
section the Director-General shall arrange -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	For prompt inquiry where he knows or has reason to suspect that any
child or young person is -</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	Suffering or likely to suffer from ill-treatment or from inadequate
care or control; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	By reason of his behaviour, causing serious concern to his parents,
guardians, or teachers..."</i>
<P>

183	The <i>Bedfordshire</i> case was considered by the New Zealand Court of
Appeal, as were policy considerations perceived to be relevant.  In the joint
judgment
of Richardson P, Thomas and Keith JJ, their Honours said at 284:
<P>

	<i>"The question is whether it is just and reasonable to superimpose a common
law duty of care on the department in relation to the performance
of its
statutory responsibilities for the protection and care of children and young
persons.  But, given the conclusion that proximity
is satisfied, the statutory
framework within which the department and its social workers act is consistent
with the imposition of
a common law duty of care.  The narrow argument is that
liability may arise where the person charged with the responsibility either
unreasonably fails to carry out the duty to consider the matter or reaches a
conclusion so unreasonable as to show failure to do
its duty.</i>
<P>

<i>	Given the important features of the 1974 Act which we have been
emphasising, it cannot be said that a common law duty of care in
these terms
would cut across the whole statutory scheme. At that early triggering step a
specific positive duty rests on the Director-General.
 At that step it does not
require participation with other agencies.  The duty suggested does not
conflict with any other duty by
the department and its officers.  On the
contrary it enhances it.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the Bedfordshire case Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 739 emphasised that the
question whether there is a common law duty, and if so
its ambit, must be
profoundly influenced by the statutory framework within which the acts
complained of were done.  In the various
respects we have been discussing the
Children and Young <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1974120/" class="autolink_findacts">Persons Act 1974</a> is clearly distinguishable from the
statutes before the House of Lords in the Bedfordshire case and the statutes
under consideration
in the large number of cases (but few in the child
protection field) canvassed in argument.  Little is to be gained from a
point-by-point
comparison.  Also, the rescue cases are not comparable because
in those cases any statutory framework was very different from the
1974
Act.</i>
<P>

<i>	There are other policy considerations to be considered although we would
not weigh them as heavily in this case as the scheme and
policy of the 1974
Act.  First, the difficulty and delicacy of the social worker's task and its
judgmental nature are relevant. 
Intrusion into the family has to be handled
with tact in the interests of the child or young person.  The social worker
must also
have regard to the advantages of not disrupting the family
environment and to the advantages and disadvantages of other options for
the
care of the young person.  Clearly a plaintiff would have difficulty in
establishing that an assessment made by a social worker
fell outside the bounds
sanctioned by professional opinion.  Nevertheless considerations of that kind
cannot absolve the department
and social workers from the responsibility of
considering and responding to specific complaints with professional skill and
care.</i>
<P>

<i>	Next, the Solicitor-General submitted that the imposition of a duty would
or could cause the department and social workers to adopt
a more cautious and
defensive approach to their duties.  He drew our attention to a considerable
body of professional literature
on that point and to the recognition of it in
the Bedfordshire case (see also Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20WLR%20628" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997]
3 WLR 628</a> at pp 636 and 638).  But like lawyers and doctors, social workers are
professionals.  At that triggering step (and at other steps)
they should be
expected to have shouldered willingly a standard of reasonable skill and care
that their private sector counterparts
were expected to discharge.  And in the
absence of any data as to potential claims based on the roles and
responsibilities of the
department and social workers under the 1974 Act, which
was replaced eight years ago by a very different legislative scheme, it would
be unwise to give any particular weight to the resource implications of
allowing for a common law duty of care.</i>
<P>

<i>	Finally, and as pointing against the imposition of a duty, there are the
obvious difficulties of reaching conclusions as to causation
and damages.
Clearly any such claims would be very difficult to establish.  That in itself
cannot, we think, be adequate justification
for ruling out the possibility of
any claim for negligence whatever the circumstances."</i>
<P>

184	Once again the framework of the legislation in the New Zealand case differs
from that in the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> but the sort of policy considerations
identified in the extract from the judgment set out above arise for
consideration here.  Plainly
regard must be had to considerations such as those
set out in the above extract, and in particular to those matters addressed in
the three paragraphs last cited above.  Nor can it be ignored that the
resources of YACS are limited, and that doubtless many demands
are made upon
those resources.  However, in my opinion contrary considerations do not
outweigh those factors supportive of a duty
of care, at the forefront of which
is the statutory framework itself and the recognition in s 148B of the need to
protect the limited
class there contemplated, namely children at risk in one or
other of the ways identified in the section.  The vulnerability of the
members
of that class is a most important and weighty consideration.
<P>

185	I have reached the conclusion that it is fair, just and reasonable in all
the circumstances for the common law to impose a duty
of care upon the
defendant towards this plaintiff, and accordingly I do conclude that the
defendant did owe such a duty towards TC.
<P>

186	What is the measure of that duty?
<P>

187	Mr McAlary submitted that at its highest the duty of the Director could
only be regarded as a duty to consider exercising the
power of apprehending the
plaintiff to bring him before the court, and this involved the exercise of a
discretion.  Therefore, Mr
McAlary argued, the power could not be regarded as
imposing a duty unless failure to exercise the power was irrational.  He
referred
to <i>Stovin v Wise</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 923</a> and in particular to the speech
of Lord Hoffmann at 953 and to the judgment of Brennan CJ in <i>Pyrenees</i> at
345 [21].  As indicated earlier in the context of considering the significance
of s 158, I do not accept that the exposure in
tort could only arise once the
placement of the child was disturbed by the department.  As I see it, there was
a duty commencing
at the mandatory investigation stage.  
<P>

188	In <i>Pyrenees</i> Kirby J said at 423 [252]:
<P>

	<i>"It is settled law that where a public authority enters upon the exercise
of its powers, it must do so carefully."</i>
<P>

189	His Honour cited <i>Heyman</i> (supra) and the judgment of Mason J at 459
in support of that proposition.  Later at p 426 [253] Kirby P referred to the
speech of
Lord Hoffmann in <i>Stovin v Wise</i> relied upon by Mr McAlary in
this passage:
<P>

	<i>"The extent of the risk necessary to convert a statutory power into an
obligation to act in particular circumstances has been various
described.  In
Stovin, Lord Hoffmann suggested that a consideration would be whether it could
be said to be `irrational' for the
authority not to exercise its powers (Stovin
v Wise <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 923</a> at 958).  Although such a test might have the attraction
of reconciling principles of the law of negligence and administrative law,
it
would impose on a claimant a burden more onerous than the law of negligence
typically does.  It may be `fair, just and reasonable'
to impose on a public
authority a duty of care to exercise relevant statutory powers in given
circumstances although a refusal to
do so would not have attracted the epithet
`irrational'.  This would be especially so where the beneficiaries of the power
`could
not guard themselves' (Stovin v Wise <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 923</a> at 954) or where the
defects said to call forth the exercise of the power are dangerous and even
life-threatening (Winnipeg Condo
Corp v Bird Construction Co  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1995/1995scr1-85/1995scr1-85.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 SCR 85</a>;
 <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1995/1995scr1-85/1995scr1-85.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 121 DLR (4th) 193</a>; cf Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609 at 649-50; 128
ALR 163 per Brennan J; see also comment in Wallace `The Murphy Saga in
Australia:
Bryan in Difficulties?'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20113%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 113 Law Quarterly Review 355</a> at
355)."</i>
<P>

190	I referred earlier to that passage in the judgment of Gummow J in
<i>Pyrenees</i> (at p 391 [177]) where he expressed the general rule as
requiring that statutory powers should be exercised with reasonable care.
<P>

191	Assisted as I am by what was said in <i>Pyrenees</i>, it seems to me that
the measure of the duty imposed upon the department by the receipt of
notifications was a duty to exercise reasonable
care in the discharge of the
mandatory requirements of s 148B.
<P>

	
<P>

<b><u>The reliability of HF and HM as witnesses</u></b>
<P>

192	Before proceeding to consider the complaints made on behalf of TC and the
responses YACS made to them, it is desirable that
I address the reliability of
TC's parents as witnesses.
<P>

	<b>HF</b>
<P>

193	HF was born in Syria and when he gave evidence in October 1997 he was
forty-nine years of age.  He came to Australia to settle
in 1972 and he worked
generally in the food industry.  Apart from a period during which he was a
cleaning contractor, he worked in
and conducted a number of take-away food
businesses.  As I observed earlier, following his marriage he was conducting
two take-away
food businesses and a pizzeria.  His subsequent marital problems
and his concerns about TC appear to have impaired HF's ability to
work.  His
evidence was (T425) that he could not continue with his businesses after 1982
because he was "tense, worried, confused
and involved in the litigation".  The
litigation in the Family Court, as I have observed, continued until 1986 and
the present proceedings
in this court have been on foot since 1993.  HF is at
present unemployed, finding support in pension benefits.
<P>

194	In the course of these proceedings HF spent a lengthy period in the witness
box.  His evidence began on the fourth day of the
hearing and it continued,
albeit with interruptions when other witnesses were interposed, until the
fourteenth hearing day.  HF was
extensively cross examined and I had ample
opportunity to observe and to assess him.
<P>

195	I have no doubt whatsoever that HF has a deep attachment for TC and that
from TC's infancy HF has been concerned to act in what
he has perceived to be
his son's best interests.  Clearly HF regarded his son's best interests as
requiring that HF should be his
custodian and this, it seems to me, accounts in
large part for the protracted litigation in the Family Court.
<P>

196	HF presented as a highly excitable and volatile witness who, as the
transcript records, often expressed himself in extravagant
language.  I
illustrate this by just a few examples from the transcript:
<P>

(i)	When HF was being cross examined by Mr McAlary he was asked about the
representations he made to various politicians concerning
what he perceived to
be the lack of appropriate action taken by officers of the Department of Youth
and Community Services.  In the
course of this cross examination HF agreed that
he complained to Mrs Foot, who was then the Shadow Minister for Health and
Youth
and Community Services.  Mr McAlary asked this question and HF gave this
answer (T344):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  I am putting to you that you went and saw Mrs Foot and put all these
complaints to her in a way that would suggest that you were
being badly treated
and the boy was being badly treated so that she would raise these complaints in
Parliament to the detriment of
the Minister?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well, the reason I have contacted her for one purpose to eliminate
suffering of my son and stop the corruption in the department.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Stop the corruption?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The corruption and aiding and abetting child abuser in the department.
That my aim, to save my son.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  To stop aiding and abetting child molesters, are you saying these
officers of the department were corrupt?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Beyond any doubt.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. And that they were aiding and abetting child abusers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes and my son as well."</i>
<P>

(ii)	Later in cross-examination HF was asked about an occasion when he took TC
to the departmental office and saw Mr Finch who HF
said looked at TC.  I
earlier observed that there was a conflict of evidence between HF and Mr Finch,
the latter saying that he did
examine the boy but, contrary to HF's assertion,
saw no bruises.  Mr McAlary asked HF the following questions and elicited the
following
responses at T352:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  All right.  But Mr Finch looked at the child on those
occasions?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, he did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did he say he could see no bruises where you claimed there were
bruises?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  This is absolute crazy and malicious."</i>
<P>

(iii)	HF asserted in his evidence before this Court (T356) that in the Family
Court proceedings witnesses were <i>"manipulated"</i> by his solicitor in the
course of a hearing before Pawley J.
<P>

(iv)	Later on in the cross examination of HF, Mr McAlary questioned the witness
about certain evidence which he gave in proceedings
before Ellis J in the
Family Court.  In the course of those proceedings it appears that HF withdrew
his instructions from the solicitor
he was then retaining and in relation to
that he was asked the following question and gave the following answer at
T382:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  You got rid of the solicitor?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The solicitor, the criminal negligence, he was criminal against my
case, yes."</i>
<P>

(v)	HF claimed that in the proceedings before Ellis J his own solicitor
deliberately refrained from calling witnesses so that TC
would be left with the
people who had been molesting him (T432-433).
<P>

(vi)	Elsewhere (T506) HF described his barrister and his solicitor representing
him before Ellis J in April 1985 as <i>"shameful"</i>, and the proceedings
themselves (T505) as <i>"shameful, it was disgraceful hearing".</i>
<P>

197	I observe at this point that HF agreed in cross examination (T343) that he
had contacted more than twenty solicitors at various
stages, although he would
not agree that he had had twenty solicitors who had acted for him.
<P>

198	It is apparent over the years since the birth of TC that HF has developed a
deep distrust of many people he has encountered
in various walks of life as he
has pursued his concerns about his son.
<P>

199	His dissatisfaction with the legal profession is evidenced in the above
transcript references and the many changes of solicitors
he has made reflects
this distrust.  Nor have those who have acted for TC on the hearing of this
cause enjoyed HF's trust.  During
the hearing there were a number of occasions
upon which HF was outspoken in his criticism of the conduct of counsel and,
indeed,
he has made the most serious allegations against them.  HF was present
in Court during most of the long hearing and his animosity
towards counsel
appearing for TC was made obvious.  He interrupted proceedings more than once.

<P>

200	On 9 July 1998, as the transcript records at T1938, HF presented a letter
which contained allegations of impropriety against
senior counsel appearing for
both the plaintiff and the first defendant.  I adverted to that incident in my
remarks recorded on the
following day (T1992-3) and I will not repeat what was
there recorded.  
<P>

201	Then on 20 July 1998 a communication was received in my chambers which was
addressed to me.  This purported to be a copy of
a communication to senior
counsel for the plaintiff.  The further hearing of the cause had been adjourned
on 17 July 1998 until 3
August 1998 but the receipt of this most improper
communication prompted the listing of the matter on what was the first
available
opportunity, namely 22 July 1998, for the purposes of alerting
counsel to what had occurred.  I will not repeat what the transcript
records
was said on that occasion, nor will I repeat the remarks which I made and which
were recorded, except to repeat the observation
that HF's behaviour in sending
this communication to the judge hearing the cause in which HF attacked the
integrity not only of counsel
but of a witness who had given evidence was
grossly improper.
<P>

202	It is apparent that HF's antagonism, not proved by the evidence to have
been well founded, was not focussed only upon TC's lawyers.
 It has, for
example, been reflected in his association with Ms Goldberg, Dr Waters and
various officers from YACS.
<P>

203	HF distrusted Ms Goldberg.  Having indicated his belief that his solicitor
had concealed from the Family Court on 29 May 1984
the names of the
perpetrators of the sexual abuse upon TC, HF then expressed a belief that Ms
Goldberg acted intentionally.  HF's
belief was apparently that Ms Goldberg so
acted to protect these perpetrators.  HF was asked these questions and gave
these answers
at T438:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  At the time when she prepared that report she deliberately omitted the
vital evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Beyond any doubt of my mind, my own belief from what is happening.  It
was intentionally left out for reasons unknown to me but
most probably to - to
keep untouched.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Most probably to?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  To perpetrate keep unknown to.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Can you say that again?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  To keep the perpetrator in the clear."</i>
<P>

204	When Dr Waters saw HF for the purposes of making the assessment he was
engaged to make in 1984, the doctor observed that HF's
attitude could change
rapidly from ingratiating to being enraged and abusive.  Dr Waters said HF
conveyed: 
<P>

	<i>"a fixed belief that his wife is surrounded by lesbians, including female
YACS officers to the extent that he denied they had any
positive
attributes."</i>
<P>

205	The doctor also recorded that HF was verbally abusive of him and other
members of the doctor's staff whilst he was waiting for
the preparation of the
doctor's report.
<P>

206	So far as YACS is concerned, HF was sweeping in his condemnation of its
officers.  For example, he said (T516):
<P>

	<i>"My view is the Department controlled by child abusers.  I certainly said
it and I certainly have a view of it today and I have said
it a couple of days
ago.  The Department Family Community Services, on what they have done to my
son, regards his safety and well
being but no doubt in my mind they have been
protecting and encouraging child abusers from 80's until today, yes I am of the
view."</i>
<P>

207	Mrs Burgess gave evidence, which I accept, that when HF spoke to her he
called her <i>"a fucking lesbian"</i> (T1692-3).  Ms Boulter gave evidence,
which again I accept, that HF screamed abuse at her and slammed the desk in her
office.
<P>

208	HF speaks imperfect English and I must make due allowance for this.  I must
also make due allowance for the concern he has for
his son which has, no doubt,
motivated much of his conduct in the last eighteen years.  Nevertheless, my
task ultimately is to determine
what of his evidence I should accept and in
this respect I am primarily concerned with the reliability of his evidence.
Having had
such ample opportunity to observe him during the course of his
evidence and the course of the hearing, and having had ample opportunity
to
consider and reflect upon his evidence in the context of other evidence in this
case, and in particular evidence that I do accept,
I have concluded that I must
approach his evidence with much caution and I find that I can accept his
evidence only where it is supported
by other evidence in the case that I find
to be satisfactory.  Indeed, counsel for the plaintiff have not submitted that
I should
take a contrary approach.
<P>

	<b>HM</b>
<P>

209	I traced earlier the background of this witness.  Whilst there has plainly
been animosity between HM and HF from the time they
last separated, I accept
the evidence of HM that she loved her child.
<P>

210	I do not find that she was guilty of sexually abusing TC nor do I find that
she participated in any sexually inappropriate behaviour
with anyone else in
the presence of TC.  I express my reasons for this conclusion elsewhere in the
judgment.
<P>

211	It does not follow from the above conclusions that HM had no shortcomings
as a mother, nor do I regard her credibility as unshaken
in any respect.  
<P>

212	There are some aspects of the evidence of HM which I found unsatisfactory.
In particular:
<P>

(i)	There was a teapot incident in respect of which HM's evidence in the Family
Court is inconsistent with her evidence in this
Court (T2649-2653).
<P>

This episode occurred when TC was about nine months old and the contents of a
pot of tea were spilt causing a burn injury to one
of TC's feet.  HM said
before this Court that TC was sitting on HF's lap.  She said that she put the
pot on the table and then had
her back to it.  She next heard TC screaming and
she saw the broken teapot on the floor.  She said she did not see the teapot in
TC's hands.  However HM was then reminded of different evidence that she gave
in the Family Court in July 1983:
<P>

	<i>"When the child was on his father's lap, he was very strong baby, and he
picked up the pot of tea in two hands."</i>
<P>

HM agreed she probably gave that account in the Family Court but explained in
cross examination here that that was what HF had told
her had happened.  She
went on to say that she did not see TC do anything with the teapot before the
accident.  However, at this
point of her cross examination HM was reminded of
the further evidence she had given in the Family Court which was plainly
inconsistent:
<P>

	<i>"When the child was on his father's lap, he was very strong baby, and he
picked up the pot of tea in two hands and I said to Mr HF,
`Please [HF] watch
it, TC have the teapot in his hand."</i>
<P>

(ii)	Her evidence that nobody told her about TC's sexual behaviour with Mrs
Blevnik.  Ms Ralston's report (Exhibit A(acl)) appears
comprehensive and
records an interview which that child protection worker had with Ms Withers,
psychologist, and with HM at her flat
on 22 August 1984.  Ms Wither's version
is found in Exhibit A(abj).  Those documents satisfy me that these two officers
did interview
HM about the Blevnik allegations on that date.  I would add that
that interview followed closely after Mrs Burgess interviewed the
Blevniks on
13 August 1984 and heard Mrs Blevnik's account of the matters raised in Mrs
Blevnik's handwritten notes forming part
of Exhibit K.  Mrs Burgess' record of
that interview also forms part of Exhibit K.  I do not accept HM's evidence
that nobody discussed
the Blevnik allegations with her, accepting as I do what
the above exhibits (A(acl) and A(abj)), indicate to the contrary.
<P>

(iii)	HM gave evidence that apart from an occasional night <i>"every so
often"</i> TC was not left overnight with friends once she was discharged from
hospital in August 1982 (for example, T2729).  However, I accept
from Exhibit
A(abj) that HM told Ms Withers TC stayed away overnight more frequently.  It is
recorded in Exhibit A(abj) that HM told
the author <i>"[TC] is used to being
left at friends' places approximately once per week"</i>, and the author noted
that in the past week, that is the week prior to 3 September 1984, there were
two such occasions.
<P>

213	The evidence of HM is to be assessed with much caution.
<P>

	<b><u>Complaints of ill-treatment of TC and the responses by YACS</u></b>
<P>

<b>	Pre February 1983</b>
<P>

214	Earlier I expressed my conclusion that, although YACS did have some
involvement with TC prior to that point of time, I considered
there was no
failure by YACS to respond appropriately to complaints made before October
1982.  I observed that Mr Shand focussed
on the period from October 1982
onwards, as reflected in the particulars of negligence ultimately produced in
the plaintiff's case.
<P>

215	Chronologically speaking, the first acts of negligence alleged in the
relevant period were in October 1982 and the officers
identified were Mr
Plater, Mr Finch, Mrs Burgess and Mr Hulbert.  Earlier, under the heading
<i>"The involvement of YACS",</i> I recorded how those officers became involved
in TC's case and I will not repeat what I wrote earlier.
<P>

216	So far as Mr Plater is concerned, he became involved because HM and TC were
living at Tempe, which was in the jurisdiction of
the Stanmore office of YACS
and at the relevant time Mr Plater was a district officer attached to that
office.  Mr Plater's involvement
did not extend to interviewing HF, because HF
was not living in the Stanmore area, so that, in accordance with YACS' policy,
any
interview of HF was the responsibility of another office.  Indeed HF had
been interviewed to the knowledge of Mr Plater because his
interview had been
the occasion of the making of the complaint recorded by Mr Male in Exhibit
A(e).  
<P>

217	I have considered the evidence Mr Plater gave in Court.  He said that when
he interviewed HM he had the opportunity of seeing
her with TC.  He observed TC
to be very happy on his mother's lap and he formed the conclusion that the
child was not at risk.  Mr
Plater said that the refuge worker to whom he spoke
had no concerns as to how HM was looking after TC.  In cross examination Mr
Plater
acknowledged the need in his position to be objective and the need to
take complaints seriously, but he did not consider that it
was necessary for
him to speak to anyone at the refuge apart from the worker to whom he had
spoken.
<P>

218	Mr Plater's involvement in this matter ceased in mid December 1982.  He did
not see the affidavits that supported the assertion
that TC had been tied to a
cot, nor was he aware of their existence at the time he was making his
inquiries in 1982.  The various
affidavits in Exhibit G, which I shall shortly
consider in some detail, were made for the purposes of proceedings in the
Family Court,
and whilst several of those affidavits were sworn in October
1982, I accept that Mr Plater did not then become aware of them and,
assessing
all the evidence, I do not find that the existence of any one of the affidavits
in Exhibit G was within the knowledge of
an officer of YACS at any time in
1982.
<P>

219	I have considered the various omissions which Mr Shand has particularised
as against this witness.  Whilst Mr Plater could have
made the additional
inquiries suggested, I am not persuaded that Mr Plater's behaviour in the
course of his involvement in TC's case
evidenced a failure to exercise
reasonable care.
<P>

220	It has been submitted that Mr Plater was biased and partial, but I do not
find this submission to have been established.  Indeed,
I formed a favourable
impression of Mr Plater as a witness, and I regarded his evidence as having
been reasonably reliable.  Whilst
in Exhibit A(e), Mr Male had recorded a very
unfavourable opinion of HF, and whilst no doubt Mr Plater read this, having
considered
what Mr Plater wrote in 1982 and his evidence in this Court, I am
satisfied that he did what he considered was appropriate by way
of response to
HF's complaint.
<P>

221	Mr Hulbert's involvement, and I referred to it earlier, was confined to the
month of December 1982.  He did not give oral evidence
but Mr Shand has
submitted he should not have written what appeared in Exhibit A(k) and (m).
Specifically, it is submitted, he should
not have written in December 1982:
<P>

	<i>"There has been a span of two years of investigations in this case and on
each occasion there has been no substance to [HF's] allegations.
 </i><cite>It
seems that in his efforts to gain custody of his child [HF] has used this
Department to harass his wife.</cite><i>"</i>
<P>

222	It is further contended that Mr Hulbert should not have recommended in that
same document <i>"that no further investigations be made from allegations made
by [HF] against his wife's caring of their child".</i>
<P>

223	The basis for these submissions is that Mr Hulbert did not satisfy himself
by interviewing witnesses that there was no substance
to HF's inquiries.  He
wrote what he wrote relying upon others.
<P>

224	Exhibits A(k) and (m) are to be considered in the same way.  Each is a
communication addressed to the Director General in response
to a call for a
report which the Director General was prompted to make upon inquiry from the
Minister for Consumer Affairs.  The
Minister's concern was apparently enlivened
by HF's complaints.
<P>

225	It is apparent from a reading of both documents, (k) and (m), that the
author did not purport to have been personally involved
in the investigations
that had been made.  The documents acknowledged that the recent inquiries had
been made by Mr Plater, and they
seem to contain an accurate summary of what
was already in the file.  I would not infer that the allegations of HF that
prompted
the Minister to intervene were fresh in the sense of having content
additional to that which Mr Plater had so recently considered
in October
1982.
<P>

226	Subject to one qualification, it does not seem to me that it was necessary
for the author of (k) and (m) to have personally
involved himself in
investigations before writing what appears in those two exhibits.  However, the
qualification I express concerns
(m).  The language of the recommendation which
I have set out above in para 222 is ambiguous.  One possible interpretation of
what
is written is that Mr Hulbert was recommending that if HF made later
complaints they should not be investigated.  If that was what
Mr Hulbert
intended to convey, that would have been very improper.  However it seems to me
that the document is equally open to the
interpretation that all the author was
intending to do was to confine his recommendation to the allegations already
made, and in
this context the recommendation is not to be regarded as having
been unreasonable.  This Court would not be justified, as a matter
of
construction, in attributing to Mr Hulbert an intention to convey the improper
recommendation.  Certainly if that was his intention
it was not acted upon,
because the evidence reveals that YACS received and responded to many more
complaints by HF after 14 December
1982.
<P>

227	The further submission is made that what Mr Hulbert wrote establishes he
was biased.  Mr Shand has placed emphasis upon the
extract from Exhibit A(k)
underlined above in support of this submission.  Certainly this was an
expression of opinion that was unfavourable
to HF, but I do not infer it was
not an opinion the author reached without attempting to make a fair assessment
of the information
before him.
<P>

228	This brings me to the involvement of Mr Finch.  I earlier expressed my
finding that Mr Finch first met HF at the Stanmore office
on 28 January 1983
when HF presented with TC.  On that occasion Mr Finch said he saw no bruises on
TC although HF was claiming they
were there.  I prefer the evidence that Mr
Finch gave to that of HF on this issue.  In particular, I found the following
passage
in Mr Finch's evidence to be convincing:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Did he bring his son with him?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  He did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you see the son?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Is this the only time you saw the son?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The only time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  When you spoke to the father, did he make some request of you in
relation to the son?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. What was that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  He asked me to examine the boy's arm and legs, and asked me to look at
the bruises and scratches that were there.  I examined
his arms and legs
carefully, and didn't see any bruises, marks or scratches.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Have you a recollection of this?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, I have a recollection of that.  That has stood out in my memory,
because that was a unique experience for me.</i>
<P>

<i>	HIS HONOUR:  Q.  What was, having somebody bring a child in like
that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Having somebody bring a child to me and saying, `Look at those bruises
and scratches' and when I looked, there were no bruises
or marks
whatsoever."</i>
<P>

229	This experience was one which could justifiably have influenced Mr Finch
when later required to consider HF's reliability when
making complaints,
although a professional approach required that any complaint received be
assessed objectively.
<P>

	<b>Affidavits and other material produced in February/March 1983</b>
<P>

230	On 2 February 1983 HF returned to the Stanmore office, this time with Mrs
Denley, and this visit led to the preparation by Mr
Finch of Exhibit A(o).  The
document was the focus of much attention during the hearing and I set out that
part of the exhibit which
records what happened on 2 February 1983 and what Mr
Finch did the following day:
<P>

	<i>"[HF] was again interviewed on February 2 at the office, accompanied by Mrs
Margaret Denley who said she resided at - 33/4 Henry Kendall
Drive, Mascot, and
was a friend of [HM].  Mrs Denley spoke derogatorily of [HM] as a mother but
was vague about specific instances
of ill-treatment.  She did mention that the
mother was seen `recently' to slap [TC] around the face.</i>
<P>

<i>	Three affidavits were produced by [HF], two of which refer to an incident
in March 1982 where [TC] was allegedly roped to a cot whilst
the mother was
out.  One of the affidavits was completed by Ms Papakenstantinou [sic] who has
now left Australia.  Mrs Denley is
now living in her house.</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] said that his wife regularly went out at night leaving [TC] in the
care of friends, often in the care of Mrs Denley.  He admitted
that he had no
evidence of [TC] being left alone.  On February 3, [HM] is to enter hospital
for an indeterminate period and in response
to [HF's] request I informed him
that this Department could not place the child in his care for this time.  He
then asked could we
investigate the circumstances of the person who is to care
for [TC] as he had heard that her house was `filthy'.  In the absence
of any
real complaint I declined to intervene.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is a custody application before the Family Law Court at present and
[HM] has temporary custody with access rights to [HF].
 Since leaving the
refuge [HM] has tried to prevent [HF] from finding her current address; on
`access days' she takes [TC] to the
refuge where he is collected and
subsequently returned by [HF].  Unfortunately for [HM] her erstwhile friend Mrs
Denley gave her
new address to [HF].</i>
<P>

<i>	I spoke to two workers at Marrickville Women's Refuge on February 3 and
they reiterated that [HM] had not neglected [TC] at the refuge
and they refuted
claims that he had been tied to a cot.  Both workers have submitted affidavits
to [HM's] solicitor to this effect.</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] visited the Minister's office last week and no doubt a report will be
called for.  He appears quite determined to remove [TC]
from his wife's care
and I believe he will make repeated representations to this end.  [HF] has no
objections to either this Department
or the Salvation Army caring for
[TC].</i>
<P>

<i>	I informed [HF] that in the light of the affidavits produced the matter
will be re-examined and he will be advised.  He declined
to give me his address
and asked that he be contacted via his solicitor, Mr Smith on - 559-2022.  One
of the Marrickville workers
told me that he is now living with Mrs Denley,
probably at the Mascot address.</i>
<P>

<i>	Referred for information and any action deemed necessary."</i>
<P>

231	I am satisfied that the above document is a reasonably accurate record of
what occurred and of what Mr Finch did.  Mr Finch
said that he did not retain
the affidavits presented by HF, but he was aware of their content when he
prepared Exhibit A(o).  He
said he did not envisage interviewing the deponents,
and he did not make use of the photocopying facilities in the office to make
copies of those affidavits.
<P>

232	What Mr Finch did was to visit the refuge before he wrote his report.  He
did not take the names of the two refuge workers he
saw however.  Mr Finch said
he regarded the cot allegation as unsubstantiated despite the affidavits HF had
presented.  However he
expected that his report, Exhibit A(o), would be
followed up by Sydney office and that HM would be interviewed.
<P>

233	Although Mr Finch did not copy the affidavits he saw, it is clear that they
reached the department subsequently when Mrs Foot,
the Shadow Minister for
Health and Youth and Community Services, forwarded them to the Director General
on 3 March 1983.  Exactly
what happened to the documents then is not altogether
clear, but they came into Mr Heagney's possession and he forwarded them to
the
regional director of YACS on 16 March 1983 (see Exhibit H).  Mr Finch had been
shown only three affidavits but the material supplied
by Mrs Foot included a
statement from Penny Tokatlidis and an affidavit by Peggy Brunner.
<P>

234	I now pause to refer to the content of the affidavits which HF had brought
to the notice of YACS and which was added to by Mrs
Foot in the following
month:
<P>

(i)	The affidavit of Margaret Denley was sworn on 1 February 1983.  In that
affidavit Mrs Denley said she lived at the Marrickville
Women's Refuge between
July 1982 and September 1982.  Her affidavit evidenced several allegations of
ill-treatment of TC by HM. 
The deponent referred to occasions when HM smacked
TC with an open hand across his face, his back and his legs, and of an occasion
when HM was restrained from hitting TC with a rubber thong.  She also stated
that HM very often went out at night whilst she was
living at the refuge,
leaving TC in his room there.  The affidavit contained no reference to TC being
tied to a cot.
<P>

(ii)	The affidavit of Georgina Daskalopoulos was sworn on 12 October 1982.
This deponent stayed at the refuge over the Greek Easter
in March 1982.  She
stated there was an occasion then when she found a baby in a cot, with <i>"a
rope tied around its waist with the ends of that rope tied to either side of
the cot."</i>  Later she said HM returned to the refuge and to the child.
<P>

(iii)	Joanna Papakonstantinou also swore an affidavit of 12 October 1982.  She
said that she lived at the refuge in February and
March 1982 and recalled HM as
a resident there then.  She said HM left her child in the refuge at night on a
frequent basis and she
said she recalled an occasion when she observed TC
<i>"lying in the cot with a rope tied around his stomach and torso with the
ends of the rope being tied to the sides of the cot."</i>  She said HM offered
no explanation for tying the child to the cot when asked to do so.
<P>

(iv)	The affidavit of Penny Tokatlidis was not sworn until July 1983.  The
deponent's earlier statement prepared, on or after 4
February 1983, was however
provided to the department by Mrs Foot in March 1983.  The statement and the
affidavit from this source
cover much the same ground when the two documents
are compared, and each contained a number of allegations against HM in the way
she mistreated TC at the refuge.  This deponent said that she lived at the
refuge in 1980 and 1981.  She said that she saw HM hitting
TC very hard on the
head and other parts of his body.  She said she also saw HM kick TC and throw
things at him.  She also spoke
of the Greek Easter incident.  Mrs Tokatlidis
claims she observed TC tied to his cot with a thick rope:  <i>"One end of the
rope was held around the side of the cot and the other end had been tied around
[TC's] waist."</i>
<P>

(v)	The affidavit of Peggy Brunner was sworn on 7 February 1983, a matter of
days after HF and Mrs Denley had attended on Mr Finch.
 Again this affidavit
contained an assertion that during the Greek Easter period of 1982 this witness
saw TC tied in his cot at night
on an occasion after HM had gone out.  Mrs
Brunner lived at the refuge between January and June 1982 and in her affidavit
she asserted
she had seen episodes of physical abuse of TC by HM in that time.
She asserted she had seen HM slap TC repeatedly across the face
and use abusive
language in addressing him.
<P>

235	The allegations coming from the sources identified, (i) to (v)  above, were
serious allegations and the response of YACS to
the information it undoubtedly
received, first through HF and Mrs Denley on 2 February 1983 and one month or
so later through Mrs
Foot, merits scrutiny.  This involves consideration of the
conduct of Mr Finch, Mr Hanrahan and Mrs Burgess.
<P>

236	The response of Mr Finch was less than complete.  His assessment of Mrs
Denley was, as he recorded it, that she was vague about
specific instances of
ill-treatment.  The deponent Joanna Papakonstantinou was unavailable to be
interviewed because she had left
Australia.  Mr Finch was not aware in February
1983 of what Mrs Tokatlidis could say, because he did not then have her
statement,
nor was he then aware of Mrs Brunner's affidavit, but this left Mrs
Daskalopoulos, for whom Mr Finch had an available address.  The
affidavit
disclosed that she lived at an address at Padstow, or at the very least that
she had done so as recently as 12 October
1982.  In my opinion the seriousness
of the allegation that TC had been tied to a cot made it desirable that she be
interviewed but
this was not done.
<P>

237	What Mr Finch did was to go to the refuge where he spoke to several
workers.  In his evidence before this Court Mr Finch said
that he asked those
workers whether the ill-treatment claimed by Mrs Denley was true, and also
whether it was true that the child
had been tied to a cot during Easter a year
before.  He said the refuge workers denied any ill-treatment of TC by HM and
that they
denied TC had been tied to a cot.  Mr Finch said (T2230) he believed
the refuge had a good reputation with YACS and he believed that
what he was
being told by the workers was reliable.
<P>

238	That was the extent of Mr Finch's personal inquiries, but he submitted his
report, Exhibit A(o), to the Sydney District Office
for attention, because HM
and TC were then living in the region covered by that office.  I am satisfied
Mr Finch contemplated that
the matter would be followed up by the Sydney
office.
<P>

239	So it was.  Mrs Burgess was the Sydney District Officer manager in February
1983.  In that role, having received Exhibit A(o),
she asked Mr Hanrahan, then
an experienced officer of YACS, to make inquiries.
<P>

240	I have touched upon Mr Hanrahan's involvement earlier .  What he did was to
interview HM, after her release from hospital, on
two occasions, namely 25
February 1983 and 7 March 1983.  What he recorded in Exhibit A(aa) indicates he
was satisfied with what
he saw.  He gave evidence about his visits to which I
now refer (at T1228):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  What did you see when you got there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I saw the mother and the child home and I saw a child in a loving
relationship with his mother.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What did you see?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  A little boy, bright, smiling face, bright eyes interested in his
mother in the sense he would go up to her and talk to her and
say `Hello Mum'
and I am there watching him, trying to find out what was wrong with him and
their relationship and he was not afraid
of me.</i>
<P>

<i>	I walked into the house and he was playing as a child of that age is
accustomed to play with one of his toys.  He was certainly a
lively fellow.  He
showed no fear or reluctance whatsoever.  I have written that down here.  No
reluctance or fear of his mother.
 She attended to him, touching him, doing up
his shoes fixing his clothes or giving him something to eat.</i>
<P>

<i>	Once he was playing near the window sill and he was part way out the window
and she said, `Come down out of the window', so he came
down straight away and
he responded quite happily to her directions.  He was suitably dressed and
there was no evidence of any abuse
of him in so far as any marks could be seen
on him at all...</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You had two visits, one on 25 February and then on 7 March.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You had no different conclusion on the second visit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No.  I need to add something.  I asked the mother did she ever leave
him on his own at home.  I said, `Do you ever leave him
on his own?'  And she
said, `No'.  I accepted what she said.  She seemed to be sincere and genuine
and I had no reason not to believe
her."</i>
<P>

241	Mr Hanrahan did not see the affidavits (i), (ii) or (iii) which I
identified earlier, nor did he have the statement of Mrs Tokatlidis.
 Nor does
it appear that he saw the affidavit of Mrs Brunner.  He said in cross
examination that he would not have regarded the content
of those affidavits, in
referring to events then twelve months past, as important, because his concern
was with the present (T1240).
<P>

242	Later however he was shown the Tokatlidis statement and he said it
described appalling conduct, and that had he been aware of
it he would have
considered it called for immediate investigation and probably the interview of
the author (T1309-1310).
<P>

243	Mrs Burgess did not conduct any interviews in relation to the substance of
the affidavits (i), (ii) or (iii) or in relation
to the Tokatlidis statement or
in relation to the Brunner affidavit.  She explained that as manager she would
not ordinarily be involved
in interviewing unless supervising a junior officer.
Mrs Burgess acknowledged that she did not seek to see the affidavits Mr Finch
had referred to in Exhibit A(o).  As I understand her evidence there were a
number of reasons for this:
<P>

(i)	the affidavits referred to events that were a year old (T1437);
<P>

(ii)	it was difficult to test affidavits outside the court processes
(T1448);
<P>

(iii)	the affidavits were going to be tested in the Family Court (T1437);
<P>

(iv)	Mrs Denley was unfavourably known to her (T1453, 1933).
<P>

244	When one considers the combined responses of Mr Plater, Mr Finch, Mr
Hanrahan and Mrs Burgess to the various allegations covered
by sources (i) to
(v), it seems to me that in aggregate those responses were less than complete
and less than satisfactory.
<P>

245	Mr Plater did not investigate the affidavits because he never saw them;
they emerged after his involvement in the matter had
ceased.  Mr Finch was
seemingly satisfied by his own inquiries and an awareness that Mr Plater had
investigated the cot claim in
October 1982.  Mr Finch stated he was satisfied
that Mr Plater's report (Exhibit A(g)) covered the cot incident although
neither
Exhibit A(g) nor Exhibit A(h) specifically refers to it, because he had
referred that allegation recorded in Exhibit A(e) to Mr Plater
for
investigation.
<P>

246	Mr Hanrahan did not see the affidavits and plainly did not see it as his
role to pursue any of the deponents.
<P>

247	Each of these officers of YACS impressed me as being an honest witness, and
I did not conclude, generally speaking, that any
one of them was other than
conscientious.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that complete investigation into
the evidence presented by
HF and Mrs Denley on 2 February 1983 warranted the
interview of the remaining available witness, Mrs Daskalopoulos, and the
interview
of HM, in which the deponents (i), (ii) and (iii) were identified to
her and the assertions each of those deponents made were expressed,
in order to
obtain HM's specific response.
<P>

248	Then later on, when YACS received the Tokatlidis statement and the
affidavit of Mrs Brunner, again having regard to the serious
matters raised,
their substance warranted the interview of these witnesses, and also further
interview with HM concerning such substance.
 That, of course, was not done.
<P>

249	It does not seem to me that the dates of the events referred to in the
affidavit material justified the failure to further investigate
in the manner I
have identified.
<P>

250	True it is that the age of the allegations when they came to the notice of
YACS was a relevant matter, because if a child was
brought before the
Children's Court under Part XIV of the <i>Child Welfare Act</i>, it was
necessary to prove that the child was at that time a<i> "neglected child".</i>
The language of the statute, and I have referred to the relevant provisions
earlier, directs the court to consider the present position.
<P>

251	Section 82 requires the court to make a finding in terms that use the
present tense.  The court may do one or other of the things
that it is
empowered to do under sub-s (1) if it <i>"finds that a
child...</i><cite>is</cite><i> a neglected...child..."</i>.
<P>

252	However it does not follow from the language of the Act that an act of
mistreatment that occurred twelve months before a child
came before the
Children's Court would necessarily be irrelevant.  Any mistreatment could be
indicative of systematic abuse, and
in any event it seems to me that the more
serious an episode of abuse, the more widespread the need for investigation.
Indeed, <i>Whale v Tonkins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20Fam%20LR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(9 Fam LR 410)</a> is authority which is in point.
In that case the Court of Appeal determined that a magistrate was in error in
rejecting evidence
from a child's school teacher that had been gathered over a
period of several months prior to the matter coming before the court.
 In a
judgment with which the other members of the court agreed, Hutley JA said at
411:
<P>

	<i>"Guardianship is a continuing state.  When the court is enquiring whether a
child is under incompetent or improper guardianship, though
it has to find that
existing at a certain date, it is in no way concerned with events close to that
date; it is concerned with all
evidence which is relevant, that is, evidence
which can make more probable or less probable a finding as to the kind of
guardianship
the child is experiencing.  The enquiry may cover years."</i>
<P>

253	(I suspect there is a typographical error in the above passage and that
<i>"no way"</i> should read "<i>not only"</i>.)
<P>

254	It is to be recognised that YACS may well have faced difficulties in
assessing the material available had there been a complete
investigation.
<P>

255	Each of the affidavits above referred to was prepared for the purposes of
the proceedings which at all relevant times were pending
in the Family Court.
Mrs Burgess was aware of those pending proceedings and I consider Mrs Burgess
was realistic in acknowledging
the difficulty of testing affidavit material
outside the court processes.
<P>

256	Indeed the difficulties which Mrs Burgess perceived in assessing the
reliability of affidavits <i>"outside the court process"</i> were encountered
inside that process by the judges who heard the matter in the Family Court.
The various deponents gave evidence
before Pawley J. (Peggy Brunner's affidavit
was introduced in the current proceedings as Exhibit T.)  His Honour, in the
course of
his judgment delivered on 30 August 1983 (part of Exhibit 9 in these
proceedings), said he found those witnesses <i>"unsatisfactory"</i> and that he
<i>"would hesitate to place reliance on their evidence"</i>.  Having reviewed
their evidence about the cot episode, the judge said that he found it <i>"quite
impossible to know where the truth of this matter lies"</i>.
<P>

257	Later in the ultimate proceedings in the Family Court before Bulley J, his
Honour, after hearing evidence from Mrs Tokatlidis
and from Mrs Brunner,
assessed their evidence thus (at p 123 of his judgment) -
<P>

Mrs Tokatlidis (Jackas):
<P>

	<i>"I was not impressed by this witness.  I felt she was far from careful in
giving her evidence, her demeanour was poor, her recollection
did not seem to
be reliable.  I consider it unsafe to place credence on her testimony."</i>
<P>

Mrs Morund (formerly Brunner):
<P>

	<i>"She had virtually no recollection of the events at the refuge in relation
to which she was called to testify.  Again I consider it
unsafe to rely upon
her affidavit at all."</i>
<P>

258	I do not regard those judicial findings as binding me as the tribunal of
fact in this case, but I refer to them by way of emphasis
of the difficulties
that would or may have been experienced by YACS officers called upon to assess
conflicting statements without
the benefit of court process.  I accept that Mrs
Burgess perceived the difficulties of assessment that she expressed and that
those
difficulties may have influenced the extent of the investigation
undertaken.
<P>

259	However, whatever difficulties of evaluation of such evidence may have
confronted the officers of YACS, the allegations contained
in the sources
identified in para 234 (i) to (v) were of such a serious nature I find that
they should have been further investigated
in the various respects I have
identified.  The failure to do so was not excusable because of the time that
had elapsed since the
events asserted were alleged to have occurred nor was
such failure excusable on any other basis.  I find that the shortcomings in
the
investigation of such serious allegations amounted to a failure to exercise
reasonable care.
<P>

260	Even though the misconduct alleged against HM in the material that was made
available to YACS in the first quarter of 1983 related
to events that had
occurred up to twelve months previously, I accept, as Professor Oates opined,
that conduct of the nature alleged,
if it did occur, was only occasionally of a
"one-off" nature.  Hence the need for a complete investigation and that need
was not
met.
<P>

261	To whom is that failure to be attributed?
<P>

262	When Mr Finch was conducting his inquiries he had no evidence from Mrs
Tokatlidis nor from Mrs Brunner.  However I have indicated
what other inquiries
that should at that time have been made in para 247. When the Tokatlidis
statement and the Brunner affidavit
came to the department, those persons
should have been interviewed and their allegations should have been put to HM.
I am satisfied
that Mr Langshaw received material from Mrs Foot under cover of
her letter of 1 March 1983 which included the Tokatlidis statement
and the
Brunner affidavit.  That material should have been passed on to Mrs Burgess for
follow up.  Mr Hanrahan said he did not see
that material and I accept his
evidence to that effect.  Mrs Burgess was very vague about when she saw the
relevant material, although
she said that to the best of her knowledge she had
not seen it before 21 August 1984 (T1506).  Either Mrs Burgess is mistaken in
this recollection or Mr Langshaw did not pass it on to her for investigation.
Either way an officer of YACS failed to ensure that
the appropriate measures
were taken because if Mr Langshaw did pass the material on to Mrs Burgess, Mrs
Burgess should have had the
necessary interviews carried out, and they were
not.
<P>

263	Another possibility is that Mr Langshaw did not pass the material on
because he was told that it was not new and had already
been investigated.
Indeed, the note in Mr Langshaw's handwriting in Exhibit A(adb) suggests this
may have been what occurred:
<P>

	<i>"Mrs Foot's Private Secretary recently phoned to notify that [HF] had
complained to Mrs Foot and that she had received a statement
about the
Department's inaction.  I asked for whatever evidence Mrs Foot had because
Department inquiries had not revealed that the
child was at risk and that he
seemed to be well cared for.  These papers have now arrived.  They do not
contain fresh material."</i>
<P>

264	If Mr Langshaw was advised that the papers contained no fresh material,
that was wrong because the material was certainly fresh.
 If such advice was
given it can only have been given by some officer of the department, and, if
so, in giving that advice that officer
could not have exercised reasonable
care.
<P>

265	Ultimately it does not matter how it came about that the matter was not
sufficiently investigated, because it is clear that
the responsibility for the
inadequacies of investigation lies with YACS.  It was the officers of YACS who
failed to do what the exercise
of reasonable care required.
<P>

266	I should add that if such investigation had achieved nothing more, it may
well have prompted the investigating officer to record
that he was unable to
determine whether the misconduct alleged had happened or not; in a sense an
open finding.  Such a record could
potentially have been more helpful to those
later reviewing the history of the matter.  For instance, Ms Boulter referred
in Exhibit
A(jj), (kk) and (ww) to <i>"unsubstantiated"</i> complaints and in
Exhibit A(xxx) Mr Lungley recorded <i>"On no occasion has there been
</i><cite>any evidence</cite><i> to substantiate the allegations"</i>.  This
latter entry was plainly inaccurate.
<P>

267	Nevertheless I do not find established by the evidence an occasion on which
an officer of YACS failed to address a fresh complaint
because of the history
recorded in the YACS file.
<P>

	<b>Assessment by this Court of material as to alleged physical</b>
<P>

<b>	 abuse of TC</b>
<P>

268	It is appropriate that I now record my assessment of and findings on the
evidence of physical abuse of TC by HM.
<P>

269	In this Court all the affidavit evidence provided to YACS by March 1983 was
tendered, but the only witnesses who were called
and who gave evidence as to
the cot episode were Mrs Jackas (formerly Tokatlidis) and HM.  In addition TC
gave evidence as to some
measure of ill treatment by HM, and Mrs Gray was
called by the defendant.
<P>

270	It is extremely difficult at this point of time to determine where the
truth lies as to the events that are alleged to have
occurred so long ago.  I
must proceed cautiously in assessing the probative value of the affidavits of
those deponents who have not
been called.  In the case of Mrs Blevnik I would
add that the affidavit which she swore in the Family Court proceedings did not
cover
the serious matters of ill treatment mentioned in the statements
attributed to her forming part of Exhibit K, even though the statements
and the
affidavit appear to have come into existence in the same month, namely August
1983.
<P>

271	Mrs Jackas did give evidence in this Court not only about the cot episode
but about other episodes of ill treatment of TC by
HM.  
<P>

272	TC gave some evidence about ill treatment, but I referred earlier to the
difficulties I have experienced in the assessment of
the reliability of his
evidence.  I would add that one incident of ill treatment to which TC referred
in Exhibit 5 concerned an occasion
when he said he damaged a TV set.  In that
document TC said HM responded by taking his arm and biting him, but in his oral
evidence
TC said that HM responded by back-handing him across the face (T874).
There are other features of concern I should mention.  In that
statement,
Exhibit 5, TC said that he recollected Dr Waters telling him twice <i>"to not
say anything about Mummy that I remember"</i>.  This, of course, would have
been most improper conduct on the doctor's part, bearing upon the credibility
of his evidence and his
assessment stated in his report of 1 November 1984.
However, it was not put to Dr Waters in cross examination that he had given any
such direction to TC and I do not find it credible that the doctor would have
acted in such a fashion.  I say in this context that
I was impressed by Dr
Waters as a witness and I accept the evidence that he gave.  There is the
further feature affecting TC's evidence
that he had access to and considered
material that his father has collected touching upon the subject matter of
these proceedings
(T887-888).  The reading of this material may well have added
to any real recollection TC had of events that occurred so long ago.
<P>

273	For her part HM denied tying TC to the cot and she denied the allegations
made in the various affidavits under consideration.
 I regarded her evidence
about the cot episode as unsatisfactory and I have earlier referred to my
reservations about HM as a witness.
 Those reservations impact upon my
assessment of her evidence in general.
<P>

274	Mrs Gray gave evidence of her association with HM and of her opportunities
to see HM with TC at the refuge and subsequently.
 Her evidence was that she
heard HM yell at TC but she never saw HM ill treat the plaintiff.
<P>

275	I am, of course, mindful of the observations of the officers of YACS on the
various occasions of home visits when TC and HM
were observed in each other's
company, seemingly enjoying an appropriate relationship.  I accept the evidence
given by the YACS officers
as to what they said they observed on the occasions
of the various home visits.
<P>

276	After reflection, I find myself unable to determine where the truth lies on
the various episodes the subject of the affidavits
in Exhibits G, J, K and T,
and the added material in Exhibit K.  It follows that the physical mistreatment
of TC by HM the subject
of this evidentiary material has not been proved on the
balance of probabilities.
<P>

	<b>Complaints as to scratches in March and May 1983</b>
<P>

277	I turn now to consider evidence that TC suffered scratches.
<P>

278	Two separate complaints concerning scratches sustained by TC were made in
the first half of 1983.
<P>

279	On 18 March 1983 Dr Grunseit saw TC at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children at Camperdown.  Dr Grunseit was then the head
of the hospital's Child
Protection Unit.  He had no recall of the events when he gave evidence before
this Court, but the hospital
records disclose that Dr Grunseit examined TC, he
said probably at the request of another doctor at the hospital.  The hospital
records
(Exhibit W) indicate that TC had been brought into the hospital by HF
because of scratches and also because the father felt the child
was not well.
The hospital record concerning the scratches is in these terms:
<P>

	<i>"[TC] says he got the facial marks `when Mummy scratched him.'</i>
<P>

<i>	He also says the linear healed lesions on his legs were obtained `when
Mummy scratched him.'"</i>
<P>

280	The examination findings were as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Several scratch marks to both sides of face, on cheeks and around eyes,
from half a centimetre to two centimetres.</i>
<P>

<i>	Bruising around left eye.</i>
<P>

<i>	2 centimetre heeled linear lesion right arm.</i>
<P>

<i>	Linear healed lesions (x 4).</i>
<P>

<i>	(R) lower leg about 2&#189; centimetres long</i>
<P>

<i>	1&#189; centimetres linear ... (L) lower leg.</i>
<P>

<i>	Bruising around both knees."</i>
<P>

281	There is a further hospital notation in these terms:
<P>

	<i>"Happy cheerful boy.  Relates well.</i>
<P>

<i>	Prendergast (the name of the doctor at the hospital).  </i>
<P>

<i>	The child has a number of linear scratches on his face and under the right
eye - due to fingernails.  He tells me they were done
by his mother.  Cannot
elaborate - custody dispute."</i>
<P>

282	From evidence that Dr Grunseit gave and from the records themselves, it
seems fairly clear that on 18 March 1983 TC was seen
at the hospital and
complained that the scratches described in the notes had been inflicted by his
mother.
<P>

283	YACS was duly notified (see Exhibit A(x)) and it was Mr Hanrahan who
investigated this complaint.  He had made a home visit
to HM and TC only two
days before but he visited HM and TC again on 30 March 1983 and he made a
record about these two visits (see
Exhibit A(ee)).  The explanation which HM
gave Mr Hanrahan for the scratches was that the child had received the facial
scratches
at the refuge when a little girl scratched him whilst TC and another
small boy, Michael, had been fighting over a bike.  On the other
hand TC told
Mr Hanrahan that it was the boy, Michael, who scratched his face.  Mr Hanrahan
wrote as to this discrepancy:
<P>

	<i>"Now whether it was the little girl or the little boy who scratched him may
be beside the point, however [TC] by no means said that
his mother had
scratched him."</i>
<P>

284	Mr Hanrahan also recorded that he asked HM about the scratches on TC's legs
and she said he had fallen off his bike riding it
at Waterloo.  He wrote
that:
<P>

	<i>"The marks on the legs appeared to be consistent with the type of marks
little boys of this age receive from falls."</i>
<P>

285	According to Exhibit A(ee) Mr Hanrahan considered at the time that HM's
explanation had the ring of truth about it, and that
TC appeared to be happy
and content with his mother, showing no indication he was afraid of her.
<P>

286	Mr Hanrahan visited HM and TC again on 14 April 1983 and he recorded in
Exhibit A(ff) that on that occasion:
<P>

	<i>"Both seemed happy and well as before, I could not see anything amiss in
regard to [TC] - such as marks or scratches on his face,
arms or legs."</i>
<P>

287	Mr Hanrahan gave evidence consistent with what he had written in Exhibit
A(ee) and he said he considered HM's explanation for
the scratches <i>"sounded
honest and truthful"</i> and he <i>"had no reason not to believe her"</i>
(T1229).
<P>

288	I accept that was the conclusion which Mr Hanrahan reached at the time.
<P>

289	It has been submitted that Mr Hanrahan was negligent in his investigation
of the complaint of the scratches the subject of the
notification by Dr
Grunseit:
<P>

(a)	in failing to take into account the different explanations for them given
by TC and HM;
<P>

(b)	in failing to interview Dr Grunseit about them;
<P>

(c)	in failing to make a reasonable and impartial investigation of the
scratches.
<P>

290	I do not consider that submission to have substance.  Mr Hanrahan was alert
to the different explanations as what he wrote evidences,
but it does not seem
to me that his inquiry would have been advanced by seeing Dr Grunseit. Nor am I
persuaded that in the inquiry
which Mr Hanrahan made he acted other than with
impartiality.  I consider his response to the complaint to have been entirely
reasonable.
<P>

291	Because of the number of complaints HF was making about HM's treatment of
TC, Mr Hanrahan saw the need for another opinion and
he discussed TC's case
with Mrs Burgess.  This resulted in the decision being taken on 20 April 1983
to involve Ms Louise Boulter.
 I find that was a decision taken
conscientiously; Ms Boulter was called in, I am satisfied, because of her
specialised training
in child protection.
<P>

292	A further notification about scratches was received from Dr Kakakios from
the Children's Hospital on 17 May 1983.  Dr Kakakios
spoke to Ms Boulter and I
find that the substance of what he said was recorded by Ms Boulter in Exhibit
A(jj).  The doctor told Ms
Boulter that HF had brought TC to casualty that
morning and that the child had a scratch and a bruise on his nose and a linear
graze
on the right shin, <i>"all of which looked accidental"</i>.  The doctor
went on, as Ms Boulter has recorded the conversation:
<P>

	<i>"Father insisted mother injured child though [TC] told doctor he had fallen
at the beach."</i>
<P>

293	The doctor told Ms Boulter that HF was <i>"full of complaints"</i> and that
he impressed the doctor as <i>"a bit odd"</i>.  The doctor said that he
considered the child to be reasonably well cared for.
<P>

294	In response to this notification Ms Boulter and Mr Hanrahan visited HM and
TC on 18 May 1983 and this visit led to a lengthy
file note compiled by Ms
Boulter (Exhibit A(kk)).  I do not propose to repeat all that Ms Boulter then
wrote but the note discloses
that the visit was of nearly an hour's duration.
Ms Boulter recorded under the heading <i>"Mother - Son relationship"</i> that

<P>

	<i>"there were no indications that [TC] is ill-treated by his mother.  The
mark visible on [TC's] nose was explained by him (and then
his mother) as
gained from a fall which seemed consistent with the injury.  Other marks on his
legs were consistent with normal injuries
sustained by active pre-schoolers.
[TC] related quite strongly to his mother, showing neither hesitancy to make
requests, or to demand
reinstatement of something confiscated.  This latter
behaviour arose after his mother quietly removed a battery from his toy car
(which he was driving around the room) and hence eliminated the very loud siren
noise.  Her action appeared quite reasonable and
[HM] maintained a consistent
response in the face of [TC's] immediate temper-tantrum.  This, however,
declined quickly with [TC]
seeming to understand his limits.  On several
occasions, [TC] spontaneously approached his mother who responded warmly and
appropriately."</i>
<P>

295	Later Ms Boulter added:
<P>

	<i>"In terms of her relationship with [TC] nothing of concern was noted and
the mother - son dynamic was normal, with warmth and responsiveness
shown and
normal limits being set.  [TC] himself exhibited no fear of his mother.  He
exhibits very active behaviour, possibly with
a manic, though not
uncontrollable, component.  He related in a lively manner to the officers and
there is a question of a lack of
discrimination.  This may relate to a lot of
time spent with adults to whom he seems to relate readily.  [TC] would no doubt
benefit
from additional pre-school hours.  Although his temper tantrum was
short-lived and handled well by his mother, [TC] may well be already
learning
techniques to gain attention and/or to play off one parent against the other.
If his father continues to accuse his mother
of abuse and or neglect in [TC's]
presence, it is probable that the child will learn he is in a powerful position
and may well be
damaged emotionally by the conflict.  In view of the father's
current practice of taking [TC] for regular medical checks on access
days a
reassessment of his access may be worthwhile, especially since the child's
increased attendance at pre-school would be to
his advantage.  Apparently,
although he is able to have [TC] on weekends, [HF] presently prefers the 3
weekdays."</i>
<P>

296	Mr Hanrahan gave evidence about this home visit.  He agreed with Ms
Boulter's record of it.  He added that the explanation that
had been given for
the state of the nose and for the marks on his legs was that the child had had
a fall at the beach.  He said as
to the interaction of mother and child on that
interview that what he observed was 
<P>

	<i>"a loving relationship between the child and his mother and she responded,
I mean he responded warmly to her.  This is what Louise
has got here.  That is
correct.  They looked good together."</i>
<P>

297	I accept that the observations made by Ms Boulter and Mr Hanrahan on this
home visit were as evidenced by these two witnesses,
and their evidence
satisfies me that adequate consideration was given to the notification by Dr
Kakakios.
<P>

	<b>The period from mid 1983-May 1984 reviewed</b>
<P>

298	TC was never categorised as an abused child by YACS, but it appears the
case was placed in the "C" register following Ms Boulter's
recommendation on 17
June 1983 (see Exhibit A(kk)).  This meant, as I understand the evidence, that
a file was kept in acknowledgment
of an ongoing family case.  In any event,
there was ongoing activity in the case.
<P>

299	Ms Boulter made a home visit with Mr Hanrahan on 16 June 1983, on which
occasion both HM and TC were seen.  That same day there
followed an interview
in the office of YACS with HF (see Exhibit A(pp)).  
<P>

300	There was another home visit by Ms Boulter on 21 June 1983 when Ms Boulter
saw HM and, following his return from access with
HF, she also saw TC (see
Exhibit A(rr)).  It is noteworthy that on the occasion of this visit Ms Boulter
saw the child leaving his
father's car on return from access.  TC claimed that
HF had pushed him out of the car.  This was contrary to Ms Boulter's
observation.
 This prompted the recording by Ms Boulter:
<P>

	<i>"The distinct impression gained was that [TC] reiterated what his mother
had said and what he thought she wanted to hear and that,
like many young
children caught in a conflictual marital situation, he was supporting the
parent present."</i>
<P>

301	This was a factor acknowledged by experts called in the case and I accept
that it was a factor making the various tasks of assessment
of complaints more
difficult for the various officers of YACS involved in this case.
<P>

302	Indeed Mr Goard, to whom Dr Younan first referred the plaintiff for
assessment towards the end of 1983, identified this feature
as being present in
this case.  Mr Goard saw TC on a number of occasions, including an occasion in
January 1984 following an order
made by Pawley J that TC be seen with HM.
Following the January 1984 visit Mr Goard reported on 17 January 1984 (part of
Exhibit
Y):
<P>

	<i>"[TC] is an extremely intelligent child who is remarkably manipulative for
his age.  He freely attempts to play one parent off against
the other, for
example, with tales of maltreatment and complaints.  At one point his mother
challenged him mildly when he said his
father smacks him all the time and [TC]
readily admitted he was lying and then laughed."</i>
<P>

303	Then on 27 June HF attended the office of YACS and saw Ms Boulter.  He
requested that YACS interview those who had made affidavits
(and this
presumably was a reference to the affidavits first produced to Mr Finch).  He
was told that the Family Court was the appropriate
place for those affidavits
to be considered.  I note that at this time the hearing before Pawley J at
which the deponents to those
affidavits were called as witnesses was imminent.

<P>

304	On 28 June 1983 a home visit was made by Mr Hanrahan and by Ms Boulter.  HM
was not at home but whilst the YACS officers were
present HF arrived to return
TC.  Ms Boulter said that on both 27 and 28 June 1983 HF was abusive and on the
earlier of those two
occasions he called her a lesbian.  I accept the evidence
which Ms Boulter gave as to this.
<P>

305	On 4 July 1983 Ms Boulter made a home visit, seeing both TC and HM.
<P>

306	Another home visit was made on 12 July 1983 and both mother and child were
seen.
<P>

307	Then again on 21 July Ms Boulter made a home visit, again seeing mother and
child.
<P>

308	On 10 August and 15 August 1983 Mr Hanrahan attended the plaintiff's home
but was unsuccessful in seeing mother or child there.
 Mr Hanrahan did, on the
second occasion, go to the Waterloo Pre School and there he discussed the
child's progress with the director.
<P>

309	A further home visit was made by Mr Hanrahan on 22 August 1983 and on this
occasion he saw HM.
<P>

310	Then on 18 November 1983 Mr Hanrahan endeavoured unsuccessfully to speak
with HM on the telephone.  He did speak thereafter
to TC's teacher at pre
school and he recorded on his report, Exhibit A(zz), what the teacher had to
say.  She reported that HF had
visited the pre school and inter alia had said
that TC was displaying suggestive acts towards women.  It has been alleged that
Mr
Hanrahan's failure to follow up the receipt of that information by
investigation constituted negligence on his part.  I do not consider
that Mr
Hanrahan had an obligation to take any positive action about the information
relayed to him in that fashion.  At the time
of writing the report Mr Hanrahan
was about to cease his involvement in this case and to go to the Burwood
office.  He regarded it
as important enough to record what the teacher had told
him for the benefit of those who were to follow him in dealing with the case,
and it seems to me that that was appropriate behaviour then.
<P>

311	Before passing from Mr Hanrahan's involvement, it is convenient to address
a submission made by Mr Shand that the officers of
YACS were deflected from
their task by an asserted agreement with the Family Court.  The source of this
submission is to be found
in Exhibit A(s), a file note in the handwriting of Mr
Hanrahan dated 23 February 1983.  In that note the author recorded the
circumstances
in which he rang Mr Bevan, a counsellor at the Family Court, for
details as to the custody and access arrangements concerning TC.
 Mr Hanrahan
recorded that Mr Bevan told him there was an agreement that YACS <i>"would only
intervene in dire circumstances in such cases as those which were before the
Family Court"</i> and that Mr Bevan did not consider the case warranted such
intervention.  The note then concluded:
<P>

	<i>"In view of what Mr Bevan says does the DG wish us to continue our efforts
to see [HM]?  Message left with Mr Langshaw's secretary
in his absence."</i>
<P>

312	Exhibit A(aa) records that Mr Hanrahan proceeded to interview HM with TC
two days later and then again on 7 March 1983.  It
was Mr Hanrahan's
recollection that he made those visits at Mr Langshaw's request, which
indicates that the response to the query
he had raised at the end of Exhibit
A(s) was in the affirmative.
<P>

313	I have reviewed above the nature and extent of Mr Hanrahan's involvement in
this case thereafter.
<P>

314	I am not satisfied that there was any such agreement as Mr Bevan appears to
have asserted.  Certainly Mrs Burgess was aware
of no such agreement (T 1398).
Heeding the conduct of the officers of YACS, including the conduct of Mr
Hanrahan after the conversation
referred to in Exhibit A(s), I am not persuaded
that such officers were deflected from their responsibilities by reason of any
notion
of any agreement that Mr Bevan may have advanced.
<P>

315	Between October 1983 and January 1984 there were many specialist
assessments of TC undertaken, on HF's initiative.  There were
the attendances
upon Dr Younan, Mr Goard and Mr Malak to which I referred earlier in this
judgment.  HF also took his son to see
a social worker, Mr Ford, at the
Children's Hospital on 9 January 1984.
<P>

316	Then on 12 January 1984 the court counsellor, Mr Lutzyk, saw the plaintiff,
his father and his mother following a direction
by Pawley J on the previous
day.  The counsellor's report was ordered and was to be focussed particularly
on the suggestion that
TC was afraid of HM.  Mr Lutzyk's report became Exhibit
8.  The counsellor assessed the interaction of HM and TC to be <i>"spontaneous,
warm and happy"</i>.  The order for joint guardianship followed on 20 January
1984.  HF appealed from the making of that order and there followed a flurry
of
activity in the Family Court which is conveniently recorded in the chronology
forming part of Exhibit 9.  
<P>

317	Looking at the involvement of YACS in the early part of 1984, there was
little activity.  Ms Boulter endeavoured to undertake
a home visit on 5 January
1984 but there was no-one home.  Ms Boulter ascertained that HM had been
staying at the Marrickville refuge
when she inquired there a week later.  Then
on 12 April 1984 Ms Boulter and Mr Lungley made a home visit where both mother
and child
were seen together (see Exhibit A(abl) and (ade)).  By this time, as
Ms Boulter recorded in Exhibit A(abl), HM had moved to the unit
at The Rocks.
Ms Boulter recorded that throughout the visit the mother/son relationship
<i>"presented as normal"</i>.  Her assessment then was that there were no
indications during the visit that HM was abusing or ill-treating the child.
<P>

	<b>The May 1984 notification of sexual abuse and the response by</b>
<P>

<b>	 YACS</b>
<P>

318	This brings me to a consideration of the responses of YACS once the
allegations concerning the sexual abuse of TC had come to
its notice.
<P>

319	I drew attention earlier to HF's complaint to Ms Harris on 7 May 1984 that
TC had asked him to <i>"suck his cock"</i> and that HM and her friend did this.
That complaint was immediately followed by the histories taken by Dr Younan and
by Mr Malak
to which I also referred earlier.  The evidence satisfies me that
Ms Harris alerted YACS and that a Child at Risk Notification was
received at
the Sydney office of YACS on 11 May 1984 (see Exhibit A(mmm); see also Exhibit
A(abp)).
<P>

320	The notification of 11 May 1984 of course introduced a new and serious
allegation and I therefore propose to examine in some
detail what was done by
YACS thereafter.
<P>

321	On 11 May 1984 Ms Boulter also received a call from Mr Hampson, a social
worker at Prince of Wales Hospital, advising that HF
had attended that hospital
as well, making a like complaint.  This complaint received by Mr Hampson was
recorded by Ms Boulter in
Exhibit A(jjj) and it is convenient to address two
criticisms of Ms Boulter arising out of what she there wrote.
<P>

322	The first criticism concerns the decision then taken that Mr Hampson would
not assess TC.  In my opinion that criticism is not
justified.  Ms Boulter was
correct to perceive that another assessment by another social worker was
inappropriate, and properly considered
that any further assessment should be
undertaken at the Children's Hospital where TC had been assessed already.
<P>

323	The second criticism is that Ms Boulter did not recognise the seriousness
of the allegation.  I do not regard that criticism
as well founded.  This was
the first notice this witness had of any allegation of sexual abuse.  It does
not seem to me that Ms Boulter
is to be criticised for having been sceptical as
to the allegation at this stage.  It must be borne in mind that Ms Boulter had
had
ample opportunity to assess HM, and moreover Ms Boulter's own professional
experience had been that she had encountered only one
case of sexual abuse of a
child by his mother in ten years work (T2092).  At this time all Ms Boulter had
was a second-hand account
of a complaint made by HF.
<P>

324	It was on the day after YACS had been first alerted to the allegations of
sexual abuse that Ms Goldberg saw HF and TC again
on 12 May 1984.  She reached
the conclusion to which I referred earlier, and which conclusion I accept, that
TC had been sexually
abused by some experienced female person.
<P>

325	On 14 May 1984 Mr Lungley, who by this time, according to Ms Boulter
(T2093), had taken over the day to day handling of TC's
case, spoke to HM by
telephone.  HM advised Mr Lungley she was aware of HF's allegations because he
had made them at the Family Court
that day when the court had ordered that HF
return TC to HM by 7.00 pm.  I note that on 14 May Pawley J made an order for
separate
representation for TC.
<P>

326	On 16 May 1984 Mr Lungley telephoned Mr Malak who informed him that TC had
described certain sexual practices to him which Mr
Malak was not prepared to
specify over the telephone.  On the same day arrangements were put in place for
a case conference concerning
TC to be held at the Children's Hospital on 21 May
1984.  The minutes of that case conference were admitted into evidence as
Exhibit
A(ppp).  Concern was expressed at this conference as to the lack of
coordination because so many agencies had been involved through
HF's
initiative.  That involvement is reflected by those present at the conference:
Ms Harris, the psychologist from the Children's
Hospital was present, as was Ms
Goard from the Child Care Centre, Dr Gallyot and Dr Steal from the Bankstown
Area Health Service
and Mr Lungley, Ms Boulter and Ms Curtis from YACS.  It was
resolved to arrange for TC's assessment by a child psychiatrist and that
that
assessment should be organised by the Children's Hospital (I presume by Ms
Harris) and by the Bankstown Area Health Service.
 Mr Lungley was appointed the
case coordinator and a further case conference was arranged for 9 July 1984 at
the Children's Hospital.
 I should add that it was resolved that both HM and HF
should be interviewed by the psychiatrist in the course of and for the purposes
of the contemplated assessment.
<P>

327	On 22 May Mr Lungley spoke again with HM about the allegations of her
sexual abuse of her son.  Mr Lungley has recorded in Exhibit
A(abp) that HM
strenuously denied those allegations and maintained that the only Judith of her
acquaintance was a Judith Curran who
was a woman in her fifties, with four
grown-up children, who had cared for TC when HM was in hospital in February
1983.  HM told
Mr Lungley that Judith Curran was not a lesbian and that she had
no cause to suspect her of having a sexual interest in children.
 She also told
Mr Lungley that she had not seen Ms Curran since December 1983.  (As to this,
HF gave evidence that Judith Curran
attended Dr Waters rooms in 1984 with Ms
Morris when HF and TC were present, and this would suggest an ongoing
association between
HM and Judith Curran until that time.  However Mrs Gray
said she was the person who with Ms Morris attended on that occasion and
I
accept the evidence of Mrs Gray on this point.)
<P>

328	On 31 May 1984 Mr Lungley spoke with Mr McCourt, the solicitor by then
representing TC in the Family Court proceedings.  Mr
McCourt was agreeable to
the proposed assessment.  By 22 June 1984 the necessary consent for that
assessment was obtained from HF.
 On that day it seems that HF showed Mr Ryan a
copy of the Goldberg report and Mr Ryan relayed some of the details in that
report
to Mr Lungley.  This prompted a home visit by Mr Lungley when he saw HM
and TC.  The issue of sexual abuse was raised and Mr Lungley
has recorded HM's
denial, again in Exhibit A(abp).
<P>

329	At the case conference on 9 July 1984 it was determined that Dr Waters
would conduct the psychiatric assessment.  I pause here
to observe that no
justifiable criticism of Dr Waters' selection could be maintained having regard
to his professional standing.
 It was determined that reports from those
agencies that had been involved in TC's case would be forwarded to Dr Waters
and Dr Waters
wrote to Mr Lungley on 16 July 1984 requesting all previous
relevant reports and assessments and any other documents that Mr Lungley
believed might assist the doctor in his assessment task.
<P>

330	On 1 August 1984 the Sydney District Office of YACS received from Mr
Samways, the district manager of Bankstown, copies of affidavits
of HF and
Penny Tokatlidis together with a copy of Ms Goldberg's report.  On that same
day Mr Lungley sent off to Dr Waters a report
which he prepared on 31 July 1984
(Exhibit A(xxx)), together with copies of Ms Goldberg's report, Mr Malak's
report, a report from
Dr Rose, and Ms Boulter's report of 17 June 1983 (Ex
A(part of (kk)).
<P>

331	It is recorded in Exhibit A(abp) that YACS first received the important
report written by Ms Goldberg on 11 July 1984 when it
had been decided, after
discussion between Mr Lungley and Mr Long, the assistant district manager, that
its receipt warranted no
additional step before the outcome of Dr Waters'
assessment was known.
<P>

332	I note that Mrs Burgess, who resumed her duties as district manager in the
Sydney office in July 1984, endorsed her approval
on Exhibit A(xxx) on 9 August
1984 but she also recorded:
<P>

	<i>"I am seriously concerned about the emotional welfare of this child and
wish to discuss this with the Regional Director next week."</i>
<P>

333	On 14 August 1984 Mrs Burgess interviewed the Blevniks and I have already
recorded the substance of what she was then told.
 On the same day Mrs Burgess
prepared a document, Exhibit A(abc), which reviewed her assessment of the
matter.  At that time she
was under the mistaken belief apparently that all the
material then available to the department had been considered by a judge of
the
Family Court.  That is incorrect, as Mrs Burgess herself apparently
subsequently discovered (see Exhibit A(acd)).  Mrs Burgess
expressed her
opinion in this document of 14 August, acknowledging the continuing involvement
of the Family Court:
<P>

	<i>"I don't question the Family Court's judgment on legal matters, nor its
counsellors' expertise in family problems.  I am unconvinced,
however, in their
expertise in abuse - particularly sexual abuse.</i>
<P>

<i>	The various psychologists' reports, which do not explain the leaps from
observed behaviour to conjecture, at least do indicate a
deterioration in
[TC].</i>
<P>

<i>	I believe it is imperative that the Department be granted leave to
intervene/appear in this matter."</i>
<P>

334	Mr Callaghan, the regional director, had discussions with Mr Finch, Mrs
Burgess and others before seeing HF on 21 August 1984.
 It appears from Exhibit
A(abf) that HF provided for Mr Callaghan, inter alia, a copy of his affidavit,
a copy of Ms Goldberg's affidavit,
copies of the affidavits of Peggy Brunner
and Joanna Papakonstantinou, a statutory declaration from Penny Tokatlidis, an
affidavit
from Theresia Wolf, and reports from Mr Malak and Dr Younan.  I
observe that this is the first record in the documentary exhibits,
so far as I
can see, which records any study of the declaration of Penny Tokatlidis.  As
far as the affidavit of Theresia Wolf is
concerned this would appear to be the
first occasion that any officer of YACS became aware of it.  It was only sworn
on 25 July 1984
and it referred to an incident at the airport on 18 May 1984
when TC had behaved in an inappropriate fashion, pressing his mouth
against the
deponent's pubic area.
<P>

335	It is evident that what Mr Callaghan had read, coupled presumably with the
earlier discussions to which he referred in Exhibit
A(abf), caused Mr Callaghan
concern as to TC's welfare.  He recorded in his document of 21 August 1984 the
following:
<P>

	<i>"2.	Some of these documents have been prepared by professional workers and
it appears that they corroborate [HF's] contention that
his child is at risk in
the care of his mother.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	It seems that there is medical evidence that the child's face was either
slapped or scratched by an adult and this occurred while
he was in the care of
his mother.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	There is evidence that the child is involved in sexual activities which
he alleges that he learnt from his mother and a friend
of hers called
Judith.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	There is evidence that workers at the refuge alleged that [HM] has not
properly cared for the child while at the refuge.  The
statement that the child
was tied to its bed is of itself a matter of grave concern.</i>
<P>

<i>	Irrespective of the criticisms which may apply to [HF], on the material
submitted to me, there seems to be a strong prima facie case
that the child has
been abused and there are indications that this Department should take action
to take him into care.</i>
<P>

<i>	I am aware that I have not fully studied the case but I would wish to
submit this information to the case conference.  I am convinced
that action
should be taken on the matter, unless other facts which are not known to me,
would support another course of action."</i>
<P>

336	On the same day as Mr Callaghan saw HF, Ms Withers and Ms Ralston attended
the child care centre at Tempe, and I referred earlier
to what they did on that
and the subsequent day.  I have also recorded the conclusions which they
expressed in their report, Exhibit
A(abj).
<P>

337	On 23 August 1984 both Ms Withers and Ms Ralston attended a case conference
chaired by Mr Finch and at which the director of
the child care centre at Tempe
and Mr Lungley were also in attendance.  The outcome of that meeting was that
there was a general
agreement that court action was required but that first
some legal advice should be taken.
<P>

338	The case conference chaired by Mr Finch was followed by the involvement of
Mr Heagney to which I referred earlier.  In Exhibit
A(abr) Mr Heagney stated
his reasons for advising against initiating proceedings in the Children's
Court.  Because it is alleged
that the defendant was negligent in not going to
the Children's Court, it is appropriate that I here record what Mr Heagney had
to
say when advising the regional director on 31 August 1984:
<P>

	<i>"As I indicated to Mr Finch, I would advise against initiating proceedings
at this stage under the Child Welfare Act.  The evidence
which is available to
support a complaint under s.72 of that Act has in the main already been put in
evidence before the Family Court
- and there denied by [HM].  It seems also
that Ms Goldberg's report of her consultation with [HF] on the 12th May, 1984
was placed
before the Family Court on the 29th May, 1984, although it may not,
at that stage, have been supported by an affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	This being the case, it seems to me that to begin proceedings in the
Children's Court would only duplicate the proceedings which
are already before
the Family Court and which have occupied so much time there.  [HM] will deny in
the Children's Court, as she has
in the Family Court, the truth of the
allegations which are made by [HF].  The report of Ms Goldberg is untested in
cross examination
and in any event as she expressly says in paragraph 13 of her
affidavit of the 26th July, 1984, she made no attempt to discover the
identity
of the person or persons from whom [TC] learnt the behaviour which she
witnessed.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility
that [TC] was instructed
in this behaviour by [HF].</i>
<P>

<i>	The situation is obviously a worrying one but, unless other and compelling
evidence becomes available, I would advise against initiating
proceedings in
the Children's Court.  It is imperative that the assessment of the family which
is to be done by Dr Waters be completed
as soon as possible.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the event that proceedings before a Children's Court are not instituted,
the best way to proceed, it seems to me, is to make available
to [TC's]
separate legal representative any material which we may wish to put before the
Family Court.  If I understand Mr Finch
correctly, however, the only
information available to the Department which is not also generally available
is the conversation with
the Blevniks on the 14th August, 1984 and a
psychologist's report (which neither I nor Mr Finch have seen)."</i>
<P>

339	I observe that before so advising the regional director Mr Heagney had had
a discussion with TC's solicitor, Mr McCourt, on
24 August 1984 who had
conveyed to Mr Heagney he was not in favour of action being taken by the
department in the Children's Court.
<P>

340	A further case conference was held on 4 September 1984 involving Mr Finch,
Mrs Burgess, Ms Boulter, Ms Withers and Ms Ralston.
 This was followed by yet
another case conference on 5 September 1984 attended by Mr Callaghan, Mr Finch,
Mrs Burgess and Ms Boulter.
 It seems that there was a further discussion that
involved Mr Callaghan on 9 September 1984.  The outcome of these discussions
was
that a decision was taken to become a party in the Family Court
proceedings.
<P>

341	I note YACS received a letter from the solicitors then acting for HF,
Spooner Anderson, dated 6 September 1984 urging in the
interests of expedition
that proceedings be taken in the Children's Court.  I cannot determine whether
this was considered before
9 September or not.
<P>

342	On 9 September 1984 Mr Lungley and Ms Ralston interviewed Mr and Mrs Tiba
seeking information as to TC's behaviour towards their
daughter at a time when
HF was living in a flat at the Tiba residence and when TC used to visit on
weekends.  This was when the two
children were approximately three years of
age, either in 1983 or 1984.  I have been unable to determine when or how YACS
became
aware of the evidence the Tibas may be able to provide but through an
interpreter both Mr and Mrs Tiba were spoken to and Exhibit
A(acl) purports to
record the information supplied to the YACS officers that day.  (I observe that
Mrs Tiba gave evidence in the
proceedings before this Court and whilst the
content of Exhibit A(acl) would indicate, if taken at face value, that more was
involved,
as indeed does the evidence of TC, when Mrs Tiba gave evidence in
this Court she said only that her daughter twice complained TC
had scratched
her leg and that there was a third incident when he followed her into the
toilet.)
<P>

343	On 12 September 1984 Mr Heagney by letter (Exhibit A(adi)) instructed the
State Crown Solicitor to act for the department and
to seek to intervene in the
proceedings pending in the Family Court.  The Crown Solicitor was instructed to
intervene with a view
to seeking an interim custody order for the Director
General so as to permit of a thirty day psychiatric assessment of TC, it being
proposed that the child would live at Brougham during the assessment period.
<P>

344	The next event to be recorded was that on 13 September 1984 Mr Callaghan
wrote to Mr Finch urging that the pursuit of an application
in the Family Court
be given <i>"absolute priority"</i> (see Exhibit A(acj)).  On the same date Mr
Callaghan issued an instruction (Exhibit A(ack)) directed at Mr Finch:
<P>

	<i>"Further to discussions with you on 11 September 1984 and subsequent
discussions with Mr Ken Finch, Acting Operations Manager, Central
Metropolitan
Region, I wish to confirm my instructions that this Department should seek to
intervene as a party in this case before
the Family Law Court as soon as
possible.</i>
<P>

<i>	I have made this decision after careful consideration of the facts,
discussions with the Director-General and lengthy consultations
with officers
from this Region.</i>
<P>

<i>	As I believe the child may be at risk, I suggest that the matter should be
put before the Court with all reasonable haste and the
Crown Solicitor briefed
to act on the Department's behalf on this matter."</i>
<P>

345	Then on 15 September Mr Lungley spoke with Dr Waters, in effect obtaining a
progress report on the awaited assessment.
<P>

346	On 28 September Hogan J granted the Director General leave to intervene in
the proceedings in the Family Court and the parties
were ordered to file their
affidavits.  No hearing date could be appointed until the affidavits required
of all the parties were
filed.  
<P>

347	On 1 November 1984 the long awaited assessment by Dr Waters came to hand
and the doctor made it clear in that report that he
regarded it as being
disadvantageous for TC to be taken from his mother's care.
<P>

348	On 28 November 1984 the State Crown Solicitor advised YACS by letter
(Exhibit A(aes)) against Children's Court proceedings,
and I quote from the
letter:
<P>

	<i>"I further advise that Ms Boulter sought advice from my officer as to the
immediate institution of Children's Court proceedings, having
regard to the
fact that even an expedited hearing of the Department's application would not
take place before March, 1985.</i>
<P>

<i>	I advise that Counsel's advice on this question is unchanged from the last
occasion this was raised (when the Department initially
forwarded instructions
to this office to act on its behalf in this matter).  Such advice remains that
Children's Court proceedings
should not be instituted because </i>
<P>

<i>	1)	the Children's Court will only intervene in a custody dispute in the
Family Court in the clearest circumstances justifying, for
example, the
immediate removal of the child in circumstances of extreme danger.  In this
case there does not appear to be unequivocal
evidence sufficient to justify
such action.</i>
<P>

<i>	2)	[HM] would be able to apply for injunctive relief preventing the hearing
of any Children's Court application, having regard to
the fact that all the
evidence and issues are already before the Family Court."</i>
<P>

349	On 13 December 1984 there was a case conference attended by Mr Callaghan,
Mr Finch, Mrs Burgess, Ms Boulter, Mr Lungley, Ms
Lorschy and Mr Heagney.  It
was noted that there appeared to be agreement amongst the professional
witnesses whose opinions had been
sought that TC had been sexually assaulted
but it was not known by whom.  It was also noted at this conference that Dr
Waters was
not in favour of TC being removed from the care of his mother.  Some
concern was voiced at this meeting about when the case would
be heard in the
Family Court.  The information then available was that it would not be heard
until March and that the hearing could
be spread over a period of months and
this time factor led to further consideration about bringing proceedings before
the Children's
Court.  Mr Heagney advised against this and he stated reasons
which are recorded in Exhibit A(aeg).  Those reasons may be summarised
as
follows:
<P>

(i)	that resolution could be delayed by procedural or jurisdictional
problems;
<P>

(ii)	the action should only be taken if TC was believed to be in
<u>immediate</u> danger.
<P>

350	Mr Heagney pointed out that in advising against the Children's Court he had
the supporting opinions of counsel and of the Crown
Solicitor.
<P>

351	On 2 January 1985 Mr Callaghan again raised the question of withdrawal from
the Family Court proceedings and the institution
of proceedings in the
Children's Court (Exhibit A(afn)).
<P>

352	Mr Croke assumed the role of Mr Heagney in January 1985, first whilst Mr
Heagney was on leave and subsequently following Mr
Heagney's replacement and Mr
Croke's appointment as the senior legal officer for YACS.  Mr Croke spoke to Mr
Callaghan about the
question of changing courts and he advised both Mr
Callaghan and Mr Finch against such a course, expressing the opinion that it
was
preferable to remain in the Family Court.
<P>

353	On 7 January 1985 the Family Court granted the application by YACS for
expedition.  On that date Mr Croke advised Mr Callaghan
and Mr Finch that he
did not consider it would be appropriate to proceed in the Children's Court
because of problems in establishing
a complaint (see Exhibit A(agq)).  That
advice was confirmed in a lengthy memo written by Mr Croke to Mr Callaghan on
17 January
1985 (Exhibit A(aft)) in which Mr Croke concluded:
<P>

	<i>".	The delay in the Children's Courts in having the matter heard is
estimated at at least six months.  If we succeeded in that Court
I would
suggest it is unlikely that the child would be removed from the mother and
point out that this is really a casework matter
which would have to be looked
at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Even with the delay in the Family Court we can have expedition of hearing
of assessment.  If we get our assessment hopefully we
are further advanced if
not then we have not lost anything.  If we do not get our assessment then the
matter must still be determined
in the Family Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The Family Court is just as capable of dealing with the matter as the
Children's Court and the Department can fulfil its obligation
to the children
better I would suggest at this stage in the Family Court than it can in the
Children's Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	It must be remembered too that the Children's Court could not order any
assessment until the complaint is established unless the
parties agree."</i>
<P>

354	So it was that the proceedings remained in the Family Court where on 12
April 1985 Ellis J made an order dismissing the Director
General's application
for interim custody.  That order did not conclude the department's involvement
in the Family Court proceedings.
 Ellis J noted an undertaking given by HM that
she would co-operate with and remain under the close supervision of YACS, and
that
she would allow the department to supervise TC until the determination of
the custody applications.
<P>

355	Mr Dziedzic, the solicitor with the conduct of the matter in the State
Crown Solicitor's Office and the author of the letter
Exhibit A(aes), gave
evidence that the decision was taken for the department to remain a party in
the proceedings, notwithstanding
that the application had been refused by Ellis
J, because there was the possibility that the court might order that a third
party
assume control of TC and this could involve YACS.  Moreover, Mr Dziedzic
said that the court seemed favourably disposed <i>"to the moderating influence
which the department brought into the case"</i> (T1943).
<P>

356	So it was that the department was represented by counsel when Bulley J
ultimately determined the litigation on 31 July 1986.
 The reasons for the
delay between April 1985 and July 1985 I recorded earlier.
<P>

357	After the failure of its application in April 1985 YACS reviewed TC's
situation:
<P>

(i)	On 10 May 1985 a home visit was made by Ms Ralston and District Officer
Shelston.  Ms Ralston recorded a very positive change
in TC's presentation from
when she had first met him in August 1984 and the file note of the visit
(Exhibit A(ahh)) records TC as
being relaxed and happy in his mother's
company.
<P>

(ii)	Inquiries of the headmaster of Fort Street Primary School on 19 June 1985
indicated TC's behaviour at school was improving
(Exhibit A(ahi)).  The
headmaster reported that TC was displaying no abnormal or inappropriate sexual
behaviour at school.
<P>

(iii)	Home visits were made and TC was seen again on 22 July and 23 July 1985,
by Ms Ralston (see Exhibit A(ahl)).
<P>

(iv)	Mr Shelston visited TC at home on 7 August 1985.  Mr Shelston recorded in
Exhibit A(ahm) that TC was observed to be happy and
content in his mother's
care.
<P>

(v)	On 15 October 1985 Mr Shelston spoke to the headmaster who reported
continuing improvement in TC's behaviour at school.
<P>

(vi)	Mr Shelston made a further home visit on 17 October 1985, seeing TC and
HM, and he recorded <i>"The relationship between mother and child is
emotionally and physically appropriate"</i> (Exhibit A(ahm)).
<P>

(vii)	The next YACS action followed the notification by the headmaster of TC's
school on 11 March 1986 that TC had arrived at school
with many bruises.  On
the same day Mr Shelston interviewed the child who complained his <i>"new
dad"</i> had struck him.  That person was interviewed the following day and on
12 March 1986 a complaint was laid under the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> in the
Children's Court that TC was a neglected child.  He was placed at Montrose that
same day and he went into a foster home on
7 April 1986 where he remained until
Bulley J delivered judgment.
<P>

358	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that once there was
evidence before YACS that supported the allegation that
TC had been sexually
abused, YACS should have acted to remove TC from his mother's care by taking
proceedings in the Children's Court.
 Mr Shand argued that the defendant was
negligent in opting to intervene in the Family Court instead.
<P>

359	I am satisfied that consideration was given by Mr Callaghan, Mr Finch, Mrs
Burgess, Ms Boulter and the other officers of YACS
I have identified in the
review of events above to the alternatives presented by proceeding in the
Family Court on the one hand or
in the Children's Court on the other hand.  I
am satisfied on the evidence that the decision taken to proceed by way of
intervention
in the Family Court was taken on the advice of Mr Heagney, Mr
Croke, Mr Dziedzic and Ms Lawrie of counsel and that it was taken after
due
consideration by the appropriate YACS officers.  The ultimate responsibility
was that of Mr Callaghan and the documents to which
I have referred make it
clear that whilst he seriously considered proceeding in the Children's Court he
eventually acted on the advice
given by the lawyers involved.  In my opinion he
was completely justified in doing so.
<P>

360	The advice of the various lawyers consulted is recorded in the exhibits to
which I recently referred:  Exhibit A(abr), (aes),
and (aft).
<P>

361	Mr Heagney, Mr Croke and Mr Dziedzic gave oral evidence before this Court.
I am satisfied each witness genuinely held the opinions
he expressed and I
accept the evidence that each of those witnesses gave.
<P>

362	Mr Heagney said his advice was to go to the Family Court rather than the
Children's Court although he considered that a better
course was simply to put
whatever information the department had before Mr McCourt for use in the Family
Court (T1599).
<P>

363	Mr Croke, in his oral evidence, elaborated upon what he had written as to
the difficulties of establishing the necessary complaint
in the Children's
Court (T 1702-1703):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Can you just amplify the problems you saw about establishing the
complaint?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The problems I saw was that there was evidence that the lad had been
subjected to some form of inappropriate sexual activity
at sometime in the
past.  It was not clear, in fact the evidence - I will take that back - it was
not clear from that evidence who
was responsible for that inappropriate sexual
inactivity.  There was also evidence in the past that there had been some
inappropriate
behaviour on the part of the mother, one instance it is alleged
that she had the boy tied in bed.  But by January of 1985 there was
no evidence
of inappropriate care for the child, either from a physical point of view, and
Dr Waters's assessment indicated that
he did not believe there was continuing
sexual activity - sorry, inappropriate sexual activity towards the boy - and
there was no
evidence to clearly indicate it was the mother.  So whatever had
been the case before by January of 1985 there was no current evidence
that the
boy was subjected to any abuse.  By that time the evidence in fact supported -
that is from Dr Waters and some of the department's
officers - supported the
child remaining with the mother.  For that reason I did not believe it was
appropriate to take the matter
before the Children's Court."</i>
<P>

364	It was Mr Croke's belief that the delay in the Family Court would be less
than in the Children's Court (T1772), and he considered
the time and
jurisdiction factors important in choosing the appropriate court (T1774).
<P>

365	Mr Dziedzic, the solicitor at the Crown Solicitor's Office with the conduct
of this matter, said that his letter of 28 November
1984 from which I quoted
earlier was preceded by oral evidence to the like effect.  Mr Dziedzic gave the
following responses to the
following questions in his evidence (T1941-1942):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Could you just tell us what that advice was?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That the only way in which proceedings could be successfully brought
would be to seek an assessment that is, would be through
proceeding in the
Family Court.  That was because there had to be some current danger to the
child in order for proceedings to be
brought in the Children's Court.  All the
advice that we obtained was that there was no absolutely current danger to the
child. 
The allegations were in relation to incidents that had occurred some
time previously and the advice consequently was that the proceedings
could only
be brought in the Family Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  In the Family Court it was possible to obtain an order which would
allow you to obtain an assessment of the child?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, yes, and in the Children's Court it was not the case that we could
obtain an order for assessment until the complaint had
been established that
the child was neglected.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  I thought you needed an affirmative finding of neglect?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, and at that time.  That the child was neglected at that time.
There being no evidence that the child was neglected at that
time there was no
prospect that the proceedings would be successful in the Children's
Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	The problem, also, was that we were aware that there had been protracted
proceedings in the Family Court.  Those proceedings had
involved numerous
affidavits as we subsequently found - well, had produced to us, which involved
many of the allegations that had
been already made by both HF and HM.  The
Family Court already being seized of the matter, having that material before
it, and the
mother having been left with custody of the child despite that
fact, it was thought that it was much more sensible to leave the matter
in the
Family Court.  And furthermore, that it would be, in fact, abusive of the child
to subject him to further possible assessments,
further set of proceedings in
the Children's Court in addition to what he had already been exposed to.  So it
really seemed to be
the only available course to proceed in the Family
Court."</i>
<P>

366	No expert witness was called in the plaintiff's case to contradict the
evidence given by Mr Heagney, Mr Croke and Mr Dziedzic.
 Mr Shand however
submitted that no expert evidence was required to be called since whether those
solicitors acted negligently was
a matter for the Court.  He referred to
<i>Midland Bank Trust v Hett Stubbs and Kemp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Ch%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Ch 374</a> and to dicta
of Oliver J at 402; and also to <i>Permanent Trustee Australia v Boulton</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%2033%20NSWLR%20735" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 33 NSWLR 735</a> and to dicta of Young J at 738.  I accept that
submission.
<P>

367	Mr Shand further submitted that I should find the advice given by each of
the solicitors to be deficient and indeed that it
was <i>"third rate to say the
least"</i> (T3014).  He submitted that it demonstrated <i>"an inadequate and
fundamentally erroneous knowledge of the law relating to the availability of
and the advantages of going to one
court or the other"</i> (T3014).
<P>

368	I do not consider that those submissions have been made good, and I am not
persuaded any one of these legal officers acted negligently
in giving the
advice which was given.  Plainly practical considerations and experience were
matters properly to be taken into account.
<P>

369	An important consideration was the need for expedition.  This was
recognised and it was considered that a decision would be
reached more quickly
in the Family Court than in the Children's Court.  I am not persuaded that that
assessment was erroneous.  It
would be wrong to determine that issue simply
with the benefit of hindsight.
<P>

370	The application by YACS was given an expedited hearing and was heard in
April 1995.  Ellis J set the cross applications down
for hearing for two weeks,
commencing 24 June 1985, and, but for HF's absence overseas by reason of which
the hearing of the custody
proceedings had to be adjourned, that hearing would
have occurred some twelve months earlier than proved to be the case.  Mr
Croke's
estimate of the delay in the Children's Court expressed in Exhibit
A(aft) (supra) was based upon advice from an officer of the Children's
Court
and I accept that Mr Croke acted responsibly in relying upon that estimate.
Indeed there is no evidence that persuades me that
the Children's Court could
have entertained a contested complaint any earlier than the available time
frame for proceedings in the
Family Court.
<P>

371	Any decision reached in the Children's Court would have been subject to
appeal under s 18 of the <i>Child Welfare Act</i>.  The statutory appeal was an
appeal to the District Court and would have been in the form of a hearing de
novo.  Mr Heagney identified
this, in my view correctly, as a disadvantage of
proceeding in the Children's Court (T1643).  The history of the many
proceedings
in the Family Court is a powerful indicator that either HM or HF,
if dissatisfied with the magistrate's decision, would have decided
to challenge
it.  It is, in my opinion, highly likely that either HF or HM would have
exercised the right of appeal from the decision
of a magistrate.  There is
another factor also affecting the finality of any decision of the Children's
Court and that is the prospect
of further proceedings in the Family Court.  I
shall consider this prospect shortly.
<P>

372	Having regard to the structure of the <i>Child Welfare Act</i>, before the
Children's Court would act under Part XIV it would have been necessary to
establish TC to be a neglected child as defined
under s 72 at the time the
proceedings were commenced in the Children's Court.  (That section I referred
to earlier at para 134.)
 Section 82 also requires the magistrate to address
the present position:
<P>

	<i>"82. (1) If a court finds that a child or young person is a neglected or
uncontrollable child or young person it may -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	admonish and discharge the child or young person; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	release the child or young person on probation upon such terms and
conditions as may be prescribed or as the court may, in any
special case, think
fit, and for such period of time (whether expiring before or after the date
upon which the child or young person
attains the age of eighteen years) as the
court may think fit; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	commit the child or young person to the care of some person who is
willing to undertake such care upon such terms and conditions
as may be
prescribed or as the court may, in any special case, think fit, and for such
period of time (whether expiring before or
after the date upon which the child
or young person attains the age of eighteen years) as the court may think fit;
or</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	commit the child or young person to the care of the Minister to be
dealt with as a ward admitted to State control; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	commit the child or young person to an institution, either generally or
for some specified term (whether expiring before or after
the date upon which
the child or young person attains the age of eighteen years) not exceeding
three years.</i>
<P>

<i>		(2)  If a court finds that a child is a neglected child it may release the
child -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	upon such terms and condition as the court may think fit and as are
willingly undertaken to be observed by the child's parents,
one of the child's
parents or another person approved by the court; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	for such period of time (whether expiring before or after the date upon
which the child attains the age of 16 years) as the court
may think
fit."</i>
<P>

373	Evidence establishing that TC had been sexually abused in the past would
not necessarily have been excluded in the proceedings
in the Children's Court.
Indeed, it seems to me that it would have been properly admissible evidence
(see <i>Whale v Tonkins,</i> supra).  Nevertheless the magistrate's task would
have been to address the child's current circumstances and it was correct of
the
lawyers advising YACS to recognise this.  Whilst absence of direct evidence
that sexual abuse was continuing at the commencement
of the proceedings in the
Children's Court need not inevitably have led to the failure of proceedings
before that court, such absence
presented a very real practical problem and one
which it was proper for those advising on the choice of the more appropriate
court
to take into account
<P>

374	In his written advice, before expressing the conclusions I have set out
already, Mr Croke reviewed the evidence available to
the department and
concluded <i>"that the prospects of having the complaint established are not
high"</i>.  In my opinion that was a responsible assessment.
<P>

375	In proceedings in the Family Court the time at which any sexual abuse
occurred did not assume the same emphasis.  In any proceedings
for custody or
access the Family Court is required to consider whether on the evidence there
is a risk of sexual abuse occurring
in the event that custody or access as the
case may be was to be granted and the court is required to assess the magnitude
of such
risk:  see <i>M and M</i> (1988) FLC 77,076 and in particular the joint
judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 77,081.
<P>

376	At the time a choice of courts was being contemplated YACS wanted to have
interim custody to permit the thirty day assessment
of TC.  An assessment could
only be ordered in the Children's Court after the magistrate was satisfied that
a prima facie case had
been established.  Section 89 provided:
<P>

	<i>"89. (1)  Where a child or young person is charged before a court with any
offence, or is brought before a court as a neglected or
uncontrollable child or
young person the court, if satisfied that a prima facie case has been made out,
shall give the child or young
person or his parent an opportunity to call
evidence, and shall hear any evidence that may be tendered by or on behalf of
the child
or young person.</i>
<P>

<i>		(2)  The court, if satisfied that the child or young person has committed
the offence, or is a neglected or uncontrollable child
or young person, shall,
before making any order, give consideration to reports, if tendered, setting
out the details and results
of investigation into the antecedents, home
environment, companions, education, school attendance, habits, recreation,
character,
reputation, disposition, medical history and physical or mental
characteristics and defects, if any, of the child or young person..."</i>
<P>

377	Whilst eventually Ellis J refused the application of YACS, there was the
flexibility in Family Court proceedings to achieve
what YACS wanted by way of
assessment in a way that was not available in the Children's Court.
<P>

378	It seems to me that it was also very proper for those advising YACS to
recognise the proceedings already taken in the Family
Court and those pending
in that court.  So much of the relevant evidence was already available in
affidavit form in the Family Court
and there were proceedings on foot there
concerning custody of TC.  Moreover, as I have already observed, it is unlikely
that either
HF or HM would have accepted without challenge an unfavourable
outcome in the Children's Court.  One method of challenge would have
been an
appeal to the District Court as mentioned previously; but unless in proceedings
in the Children's Court an order had been
made under s 82(1)(d) of the <i>Child
Welfare Act</i>, neither HM nor HF would have been prevented by an unfavourable
decision under the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> from pursuing a further application
concerning TC's custody in the Family Court.
<P>

379	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i> of 1975 contained s 10 at the time the department
decided to intervene.  The section has since been repealed but it provided:
<P>

	<i>"10. (1) Subject to sub-section (3), a court shall not make an order under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part VII</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/index.html#p8" class="autolink_findacts">Part VIII</a> for the maintenance, custody or guardianship of -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	a child who, under the law of a State, is a ward of the State or a

<P>

<i>	(i)	a Minister of the Crown of the State;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	an officer of the State; or</i>
<P>

or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a child who has a similar status under a law of a Territory.</i>
<P>

<P>

<i>	(a)	the jurisdiction of a court, or the power of an authority, under a law

<P>

<i>	(i)	a Minister of the Crown of the State;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	an officer of the State; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	an officer of an adoption agency approved under a law of the

<P>

<i>	or any similar jurisdiction or power under a law of a Territory;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	any such order made, or action taken, or the operation, in respect of a
child in relation to whom any such order has been made
or action taken, of the
law under which the order was made or action taken;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the jurisdiction of a court under a law of a State or Territory to make
an order in respect of the maintenance of a child referred
to in sub-section
(1) in favour of an officer or authority of the State or Territory performing
functions in relation to the welfare
of children; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	an order of a kind referred to in paragraph (c) made by a court.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)  The Family Court, a Family Court of a State or the Supreme Court of a
State or Territory may make an order referred to in sub-section
(1) if it is
satisfied that there are special circumstances that justify the making of the
order."</i>
<P>

380	Section 10 was considered by the High Court in<i> re Demack; ex parte
Plummer</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20FLC%2090%2d244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) FLC 90-244.</a>  In that case the court was concerned with a
Queensland statute, the <i>Children Services Act</i>, whereunder an order had
been made by the Children's Court placing a child under the care of the
Director of the Department of Children's
Services.  When subsequently the
parents of the child sought custody in the Family Court, the jurisdiction of
the Family Court to
entertain those applications was challenged.  The challenge
was unsuccessful.  The construction of s 10 was considered and in the
course of
his judgment Mason J, as he then was, said at 76,315:
<P>

	<i>"When these sections [referring to sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of s 10)
are read together, in my opinion they place a limitation
on the authority of
the Family Court to make orders for custody with respect to children who are
wards of the State or who are State
children or are in the care and control of
a Minister of the State.  In these cases the Family Court can only make an
order for custody
if it is satisfied that special circumstances exist within
the meaning of subsec. (3).  And even if the Family Court is so satisfied,
the
making of an order for custody by the Family Court does not affect an order
already made under State law in respect of the child.
 Precise effect must be
given to the language of subsec. (2) of sec. 10 and I see nothing in subsec.
(1) and (3) which requires a
reading down of subsec. (2).  It seems to me that
the section was designed, as the marginal note `Child welfare law not affected'
suggests, to preserve the independent operation of State child welfare laws and
of orders with respect to the care and control of
a child made under such
laws."</i>
<P>

381	It follows from the above decision that s 10(2) would prevent the Family
Court from disturbing a current wardship order made
pursuant to s 82(1)(d) of
the <i>Child Welfare Act</i>.  However s 10 would permit the Family Court,
notwithstanding an earlier determination of the Children's Court under s 82(1),
to
make an order for custody or guardianship of a child unless the Children's
Court order was made under s 82(1)(d).  Mr Croke indicated
in his evidence that
he was alert to this, and he regarded a wardship order as being an unlikely
result if proceedings were to be
taken in the Children's Court (T1734).  So it
is that he perceived that proceedings under the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> were
unlikely to achieve a final resolution of the issues that had to be determined
in this case.  That was a reasonable perception.
<P>

382	Having reflected on the evidence and the competing submissions, I have
concluded that the actions and the advices of each of
the lawyers identified
were thoughtful and reasonable.  I do not find that Mr Heagney and/or Mr Croke
and/or Mr Dziedzic failed to
exercise reasonable care in giving the advice that
was given.  Nor do I find that any officer of YACS was negligent in accepting
and acting on that advice.  Once a decision was taken to proceed in the Family
Court, the delay that did occur in the course of the
proceedings in that court
was not attributable to any neglect on the part of YACS.
<P>

	<b><u>Bias</u></b>
<P>

383	It has been submitted that a number of YACS officers who became involved in
TC's case from time to time were biased.  Absence
of good faith would defeat a
defence under s 158 of the <i>Child Welfare Act</i>, but so too would the
absence of reasonable care and any liability in the defendant in this case
could only arise by a failure to
exercise reasonable care.  Nevertheless bias,
if present, could clearly have tainted the actions of any officer affected by
it, so
as to affect the quality of investigations, and it is appropriate that I
deal with this issue in some detail.
<P>

384	I have already considered the question of bias in relation to Mr Plater and
Mr Hulbert.  I propose to consider those other officers
against whom this
allegation is made in turn:
<P>

	<b>Mr Male</b>
<P>

385	G. Male was the author of a report form dated 11 October 1982 which became
Exhibit A(e).  The document reads:
<P>

	<i>"The father of this child, [HF], of 426 Avoca St. Kensington, called at the
Sydney District Office on 8.10.82 alleging that his child
[TC] was being
mistreated by the mother who he alleged, went out every night `having a good
time with the men' leaving [TC] tied
to the bed at the women's refuge.</i>
<P>

<i>	He stated that the mother had a lengthy history of mental illness and in
his opinion was unfit to care for the child.  He stated
that she had been
hospitalised at the Gladesville Mental Hospital and the St Margaret's Mental
Hospital at Top Ryde.</i>
<P>

<i>	Custody proceedings are currently in process at the Metropolitan Family Law
Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] stated that he made previous complaints to SDO Stanmore and that a
lady officer subsequently visited his home and after a dispute
he ordered her
out.  He asked that if enquiries be made into this matter they not be conducted
by the staff of SDO Stanmore.</i>
<P>

<i>	I explained to him that this was an impossible request.  He then stated
that he would go to the Minister and ask for the matter to
be reviewed.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was suggested to him that he take his complaint to the SDO Stanmore who
would no doubt be familiar with this matter and might
make the necessary
enquiries.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>It seems to me that [HF] is a neurotic, emotionally disturbed
person and that his complaint has little substance</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	He was referred to SDO Stanmore for follow up."</i>
<P>

	(Emphasis added)
<P>

386	It is submitted on the plaintiff's behalf that the document affords
evidence of bias by the author Mr Male.
<P>

387	The author was not called and I am unable to determine upon what basis he
formed the opinion in the brief paragraph underlined
above.  He may well have
seen Exhibit A(c) which purported to record the unhappy experience of another
officer, Ms Medus, when she
visited the home of HF and HM in December 1981 and
this may have influenced his assessment of HF.  On the other hand he may have
formed his assessment of HF by what he observed on HF's visit on 11 October
1982.  However the complaint requiring consideration
at that time was the
misconduct of HM that was alleged in the first paragraph of Exhibit A(e).  The
statement that it seemed to the
author that that complaint <i>"has little
substance"</i> could not have been justified without prior investigation and it
is clear that there had been no such investigation at the time when
Exhibit
A(e) was written.  In my opinion the statement that <i>"his complaint has
little substance"</i> is indicative of prejudice by the author.
<P>

388	However, consistently with departmental practice, HF was referred to the
Stanmore office to make the appropriate inquiries and
I would infer that
Exhibit A(e) was written for the benefit of the Stanmore office.  The form is
endorsed <i>"Copy to SDO Stanmore"</i>.  For Mr Male to refer the matter to
Stanmore was a proper step to take and Mr Plater made the inquiries I have
already considered
in response to that referral.
<P>

	<b>Mr Finch</b>
<P>

389	I have already written of the involvement of this officer.  There were the
two phases of involvement, the first early in 1983
and the second in 1984 after
the allegations of sexual abuse had arisen.
<P>

390	In the course of his cross-examination and in the context of questioning
about his memorandum of 3 February 1983 (Exhibit A(o)),
Mr Shand put the
following question to the witness and obtained the following response
(T2250):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  You had not made up your mind adversely to this man, had you, at the
time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I don't believe I had."</i>
<P>

391	I accept that as being a truthful response and it was not elsewhere
specifically put to Mr Finch that he was biased or lacked
good faith in what he
did in this matter.
<P>

392	I have already recorded that I assessed Mr Finch as being both honest and
conscientious and reflecting on all that he wrote
and the evidence that he has
given, I am not satisfied that he was biased in what he did.
<P>

	<b>Mr Hanrahan</b>
<P>

393	Two matters were relied upon in support of the submission of bias against
this witness. They are that he admitted that he never
recorded anything
critical of HM and that he recorded assertions made by HM to the discredit of
HF without knowing if the assertions
were true.
<P>

394	It is appropriate to extract the relevant passage of transcript for the
purpose of considering this submission:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Mr Hanrahan, I want to ask you a rather more comprehensive question
about the line that you took or the attitude that you took
so expressed in the
course of records that you compiled while acting as district officer or ASDO in
this case.  It is correct to
say, isn't it, that you really did not ever record
anything critical of the mother, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  There was a reason for that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  I am not asking you about reasons, that is the fact, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  It looks like that, I cannot see anything here.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And you did, not infrequently, record matters to the discredit of the
father, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Allegations except for this one here.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Even understanding that you recorded allegations, you are referring to
allegations which, if true, reflected discredit upon the
father, didn't
they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Only if proved.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Nonetheless they mentioned matters to the discredit of the father,
didn't they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  If proved.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Why was it that you adopted that course with the father and the other
course with the mother?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Because my job was to see if the child was being cared for properly and
to see if he was a child at risk, and when I went to
see the mother and the
child I wasn't interested in minor defects of parental skills, I was interested
in serious defects of parental
care of the boy.  I wasn't going to put in my
report minor matters where the mother may have failed.  I mean, when an officer
calls
on a house, he is interested in serious abuse, not minor defects.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Is this what you say, that you did not discover anything of
significance to the discredit of the mother?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No serious defects in her care of that child, no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You knew, of course, you were aware of the allegations of a very
serious nature which the husband made against the wife as to
her behaviour,
didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Scratches.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Allegations of abuse?</i>
<P>

<i>	OBJECTION.  QUESTION REJECTED.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  First of all the example I have been dealing with, exhibit xx, was an
occasion where you were prepared to put matters which were
to the discredit of
the husband without knowing whether in fact they were true or not, weren't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I was repeating what she told me.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Without knowing whether what she told you was true or false, is that
so?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I didn't know, certainly, no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You think that was being objective?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Not completely objective.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Now do you remember whether you expressed an opinion concerning the
father in comparison with the mother as to whether he was
fit to have custody
of this child?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I don't remember."</i>
<P>

395	The document upon which Mr Hanrahan was being cross examined in the above
extract (Exhibit A(xx)) was an application form to
support HM's application for
funds for her telephone.
<P>

396	It emerged in re-examination, contrary to Mr Hanrahan's concession, that he
recorded unfavourable material concerning HM in
his final report on 21 November
1983 (Exhibit A(zz)).  He there recorded that TC said he hated HM and he also
recorded the allegation
made by HF that she was a lesbian.  In that same
document Mr Hanrahan recorded favourable comments made by TC's teacher about
HF.
<P>

397	I observe that Mr Hanrahan never met HF.  I have elsewhere recorded of Mr
Hanrahan that I found he acted conscientiously.  That
finding extends for the
period of his involvement in this matter from 10 February 1983 to 21 November
1983.  Whilst this witness
became agitated in the course of a testing cross
examination, I formed in general a favourable impression of him, and, having
considered
all the evidence that he gave, I conclude bias has not been
established.
<P>

	<b>Mrs Burgess</b>
<P>

398	In support of the submission that this officer was biased, my attention was
directed to three exhibits:  Exhibit A(abc), Exhibit
A(acb) and Exhibit A(ada).
The first of these exhibits came into existence following an interview which
Mrs Burgess had with the
Blevniks.  In the exhibit, which reflected Mrs
Burgess' perception of TC's case at that time, the officer addressed the
significance
of what she had been told by Mr and Mrs Blevnik that day:
<P>

	<i>"Today I interviewed Mr &amp; Mrs Blevnik who were neighbours of [HM].
Amongst other matters they made serious allegations against
[HM's] care of
[TC].  I could see no reason to doubt what they said.  However, their evidence
has already been heard in the Family
Court and apparently dismissed.  In view
of [HF's] indiscriminate provision of Family Court papers, it is difficult to
assess - particularly
with fairly simple people like the Blevniks - how much is
their experience and how much comes from the information [HF] has given
them."</i>
<P>

399	It is submitted that the last sentence of the above paragraph indicates
bias.  I do not agree.  I read it as reflecting the
attempt of Mrs Burgess to
evaluate what the Blevniks had told her.  It was reasonable for her to
recognise that HF had spoken to
the Blevniks about TC and HM before the
Blevniks spoke to Mrs Burgess.
<P>

400	Exhibit A(acb) is a five page document prepared by Mrs Burgess and directed
to Mr Callaghan.  It recorded then recent events,
including what Ms Pennui,
then HM's solicitor in the Family Court proceedings, had said about what
occurred in proceedings before
Pawley J.  What Ms Pennui had to say was noted
by Mrs Burgess in considerable detail and the passage which it is submitted
discloses
bias is emphasised in the extract from the exhibit set out below:
<P>

	<i>"Glenys Pennui said that:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Mr Malak and Dr Goard had both attended the Family Court and the
contents of their affidavits have been considered by the Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Greta Goldberg's affidavit had been admitted and considered on 30/5/84.
She was not examined (i.e. G. Goldberg) because she was
not available.</i>
<P>

<i>		[HF] was cross examined and asked in view of his statements that this
alleged sexual abuse of [TC] had been going on for a long
time - why he had
returned [TC] to his mother's care.  His answer was that he was not prepared to
do anything until he was given
Legal Aid.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	[HM] had been given custody of [TC] by Mr Justice Pauley [sic] on
20/1/84 - with [HF] given access.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	[HF's] access rights had been removed on 30/5/84 (Mr Justice Ellis one
of the most Senior Judges in the Family Court).</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	His Honour had been clear that [HF], could with new evidence, have the
mother [sic] quickly heard on the production of affidavits.
 However, [HF] had
not done so.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	[HF] had had at least 25 solicitors, continually dismissing them.  He
was currently in receipt of Legal Aid which had already
cost the taxpayers
$60,000.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.	Ms Pennui sees [HM] as a very brave woman, under a great deal of strain.
She felt the Departmental Psychologist may have seen
the result of that strain
- in that the constant accelerating by `venamous' [sic] allegations have made
[HM] avoid the most normal
reaction i.e. she had discussed with Ms Pennui
[TC's] nightmares, when he wanted to come to her bed for reassurance but felt
she
must deny this in view of the allegations and how [HF] would interpret
simple comments re this.  Ms Pennui told her that of course
she should comfort
[TC].</i>
<P>

<i>	8.	Re the Blevniks - Ms Pennui said that they had in fact approached her re
the allegations, that [HF] had attempted to run over
Mr Blevnik and then she
had next seen them in Court for [HF].  They had told her they were frightened
of [HF], but denied that under
examination in the Family Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.	She had been told by the pre-school that [TC's] behaviour had improved
since not seeing his father.</i>
<P>

<i>	I took the opportunity to ask Ms Pennui:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.  </i><cite>About the occasional mention on our file of violence by
[HF].</cite>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>She said that immediately after [HF] dismissing these legal
representatives:</cite>
<P>

<i>	a)	</i><cite>One Solicitor's office had been bombed with the blast going
through a thick partition leaving a hole of 3 ft radius.  The police had
said
that if the Receptionist had been sitting at her desk, she would have lost her
legs.</cite>
<P>

<i>	b)	</i><cite>A Barrister's office received a letter bomb</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	c)	</i><cite>Another Solicitor's office had been set on
fire</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	d)	</i><cite>[HM] Social Worker's (i.e. from the Refuge) car had been
bombed during the six day hearing</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

	(Emphasis added)
<P>

401	I do not regard that passage as reflecting bias.  It was a reasonable
matter of concern for Mrs Burgess to better inform herself
about earlier
indications in the YACS file as to possible violence.  Mrs Burgess gave
evidence HF had threatened her with violence.
 It was a matter of relevance for
the future handling of TC's case and one way in which this was shown is
indicated on p 5 of the
same exhibit where Mrs Burgess, in recording her
discussion with Mr McCourt and the possible placement of TC, referred to the
contemplated
use of Brougham about which she wrote:
<P>

	<i>"d)	A small Departmental establishment such as Brougham.</i>
<P>

<i>		I said that whilst this is the placement I would recommend - in view of
the beliefs re [HF] violence - this would have to be brought
to the attention
of the Managers of Brougham who would have to consider [TC's] needs in the
context of the safety of the other children."</i>
<P>

402	Exhibit A(ada) was not a document prepared by Mrs Burgess.  Rather it was a
copy of a letter written by Ms Cuthbertson, the
Executive Officer of the Ethnic
Affairs Commission, on 9 January 1985 and addressed to the Director General of
YACS.  It contained
this passage:
<P>

	<i>"As I have personally dealt with [HF] I would like to express my concerns
about the case before leaving the Commission.  Although
[HF's] manner at times
tends to be very offputting, some of the allegations being made about him
appear to have little base in fact.
 For example a senior officer of your
Department mentioned to me that six of [HF's] ex-legal representatives had
received bomb threats
and that some of these solicitors' offices were actually
bombed.</i>
<P>

<i>	On reflection this seemed unlikely to me so I phoned and spoke to nine
solicitors who at various times represented [HF] and either
spoke to them or
their secretaries.  In all cases none had personally received threats of any
kind, but three had heard stories of
solicitors who were said to have received
threats, but could not be specific about just who these people were.  One only
said a barrister
who had represented [HF] was said to have received a letter
bomb, from unknown sources, but he is also said to have represented [HF]
after
that event."</i>
<P>

403	Ms Cuthbertson was called and she gave evidence that after HF visited her
office in early November 1984 she rang YACS and spoke
to Mrs Burgess and other
officers of YACS.  Ms Cuthbertson said that she told Mrs Burgess that HF was
with her and that he was making
allegations that TC was being sexually abused
and otherwise ill-treated by his mother and that Mrs Burgess responded
(T792):
<P>

	<i>"Be very careful with [HF].  He can be a very dangerous man.  He has made
many threats to his solicitors and the staff of my department
and there have
been letter bombs to some of his solicitors and fires in their offices and, in
fact, he has set fire to or he is suspected
of having set fire to a nightclub
in which his estranged wife was present and she was injured as a result of that
fire."</i>
<P>

404	Ms Cuthbertson's recollection of that conversation finds some support in
contemporaneous notes in her handwriting later introduced
into evidence as
Exhibit EE, although her oral evidence did not accord precisely with the
contemporaneous notes.
<P>

405	Mrs Burgess was cross-examined about the alleged conversation .  She agreed
that she had spoken to Ms Cuthbertson but she said
she could not recall the
details.  She did recall though that she cautioned Ms Cuthbertson.  Mrs Burgess
said (T1691):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  You told Ms Lozzi-Cuthbertson that he had made threats to your
life?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And she replied that you shouldn't -</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Really I can't remember the exact words.  But she really belittled that
and said that I shouldn't pay any attention to that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you mention to her that either he had set fire to, or he was
suspected of having set fire to a nightclub in which his wife
was
present?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Sir, I don't remember.  As I say my memory is that she had information
and that I really felt was not the same as was on the
file and that's why I
said I would go to the office and check with the file.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  But you did give her your recollection of what was on the file did
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I don't remember that sir.  I think she gave me what she had been
told.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  But you had known then what was on the file, at least in round terms,
didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well sir, I don't know if it's three case workers had bombed
cars.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What is on the file is here in (acb) isn't it, where you asked Miss
-</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir, and what it says there is one solicitor's office had been
bombed with a blast through a thick petition, leaving a hole
of three feet
radius."</i>
<P>

406	Whether or not Ms Cuthbertson was given all the details of the concerns
about HF reflected in her oral evidence or in the note
Exhibit EE by Mrs
Burgess or one of the other officers of the department to whom she spoke, I
accept that Ms Cuthbertson did record
on Exhibit EE what she was told by some
officer of YACS on the same day she spoke to Mrs Burgess and that Mrs Burgess
for her part
did convey to that witness a caution concerning HF and concerns
that he could be violent.
<P>

407	However, I am satisfied by the evidence of Mrs Burgess that she did
genuinely entertain concerns that HF could be violent. 
In cross-examination
she was asked these questions and gave these answers as to threats
(T1692-93):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  You mentioned to her, you told us, that you had received threats to
your life?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  From him?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Direct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, I think on the phone I received from him and I think about that
time I interviewed him again, because it's about that and
following this, that
I contacted the police.  And asked the police to see us, because his threats
included cars.  He said it was
all about bombs and I got the police to come to
the office and they actually instructed us in a number of things.  One of the
biggest
problems is that our cars were under the office, readily accessible to
the public and so the police showed us how to check whether
or not, whether
these had been tampered with.  So it was all about that time yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What did he say?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I can't remember exact words.  I know that there were threats to me and
to others.  I know the clerical assistant was very very
concerned about what he
said to her and certainly it was, a number of things were about bombs, because
that's what I approached police
about.  It was a very unsafe office and they
advised the department to move out of that office.  I think there is somewhere,
sometime
later the police did send a copy of their report to the
department.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did he say these things to you face to face?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Certainly, yes, on one occasion.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  He did, did he?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  At the office?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What did he say, to your best recollection?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I don't remember.  I don't remember at this stage the words.  I just
know that it was a matter of concern and I'm sure it would
be about this time,
because I say in this report I took the opportunity to ask a solicitor about
the mention of violence, because
you had to work out what attention to pay to
these threats.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Was that in the course of him saying, protesting to you about the
department not having done anything in response to his information
about the
treatment of the child?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Sir, it's very hard to know, because at the particular time I don't
remember this man ever allowing me to finish a sentence and
usually, I mean in
the couple of times that I interviewed him, or on the phone, he talked for only
a couple of moments and then he
would call me a fucking lesbian and then he
would threaten me and that was the experience.  It was very sad, because we
were not
able to communicate with him and I think it's very sad."</i>
<P>

408	I accept that HF did threaten Mrs Burgess and that he did abuse her as she
claimed.
<P>

409	That there was concern within YACS that HF might be violent was a matter
properly to be addressed but it does not follow because
such concern was
considered that proper attention could not be given to complaints about TC's
welfare.
<P>

410	I find that there was concern being expressed about HF by the time Mrs
Burgess spoke to Ms Cuthbertson, and indeed shortly thereafter
there was a case
discussion on 7 December 1984 at which Mrs Burgess was one of the officers in
attendance and at which this concern
was then discussed (see Exhibit A(aeg)).
Whilst it was reasonable to address those concerns, I note that when Ms Boulter
prepared
her memo on that case conference dated 13 December 1984 she recorded
that on the previous day she had spoken to Detective Paul Hume
of the Bomb
Squad who informed her that HF had twice been checked and cleared by them and
that he felt the violence attributed to
HF was probably exaggerated.
<P>

411	There was a need for YACS officers to make due allowance for the emotional
distress that parents might suffer when genuine concerns
were being felt for
the welfare of their children.  There was such a need concerning HF.  Mrs
Burgess was cross examined on this
very matter (T1693-1694):
<P>

	<i> "Q.  Is it correct to say that in your long history with the department in
matters involving child protection -</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And alleged child abuse, you encountered many cases where the child
involved had distraught parents?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  In fact, I suppose you expected more often than not, that they would be
distraught, because of the allegations, the suggested
problem?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  In the course of your work in respect of such cases, you had to learn
not to be put off from doing your duty by reason of the
emotional state of the
parents?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That's right sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Keep your objectivity?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And make allowances for the state, the parents' state the turbulence of
the parents' emotions?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, yes sir I suppose so.  I think, I certainly knew to focus on the
child and that was the way I had been taught and that was
the way I
acted.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And the case of this child and this child's father, was just such an
example wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Where you had to focus on the child?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  To understand and allow for the emotional state of the father?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You consider, you managed that in this case?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes sir."</i>
<P>

412	Mrs Burgess was very closely examined and she was in the witness box for a
long time.  I formed a favourable impression of her
and found her to be a
responsible and honest person.  Whilst I find that she was abused and
threatened by HF and that she was concerned
about safety considerations, I do
not find that she became biased as a result.  Indeed, I accept that the above
extracted answers
were truthful and I accept that she did focus upon the
welfare of TC.
<P>

	<b>John Banks</b>
<P>

413	It is submitted that Exhibit A(ccc) reflects bias.  The document is a
handwritten note addressed to <i>"Louise"</i> (presumably Ms Boulter).  The
note reads:
<P>

	<i>"Enclosed are some papers re [TC].  Mr. phoned today - I advised him that I
had made the usual inquiries and that in our opinion the
standard of care for
[TC] was satisfactory.  He, naturally, disagreed."</i>
<P>

414	The document has stamped upon it the date 16 December 1983 and it
identifies the author as the Assistant Senior District Officer,
Bankstown.
Attached to the document is a Child at Risk notification which records that HF
was at the Bankstown office on 13 December
and that he had affidavits
evidencing abuse.  The affidavits are not identified.
<P>

415	Viewed in isolation this note is dismissive and unsatisfactory.  The reader
cannot know by reference to the note alone what
inquiries Mr Banks made, if
any.  However, it is apparent from the evidence of Ms Boulter and her file
note, Exhibit A(afl), that
Mr Banks spoke to her about TC on 15 December 1983.
It appears that on that date HF attended the Bankstown office one day early for
an appointment there, informing that a psychologist he had consulted for TC
(and this presumably was Mr Goard) stated TC was <i>"quite disturbed"</i>.  Ms
Boulter told Mr Banks this was <i>"largely a product of marital conflict"</i>.
The arrangement between Mr Banks and Ms Boulter was that he would contact the
Sydney office if necessary, after seeing HF on 16
December 1983.
<P>

416	Exhibit A(ccc) suggests that HF did not call on Mr Banks on 16 December,
but telephoned instead.  Perhaps Ms Boulter had reassured
Mr Banks on 15
December that HM was caring for TC to her satisfaction and this explains what
Mr Banks wrote.  In the absence of acceptable
evidence that fresh complaints
had been made to Mr Banks in mid December, I cannot be satisfied that there was
a failure by YACS
to address them appropriately.  Nevertheless I do not temper
the criticism I have earlier expressed about Exhibit A(ccc).
<P>

	<b>T. Long</b>
<P>

417	It is submitted that Exhibit A(mmm) evidences that this officer was biased.
The document contains a number of handwritten entries
and it is the last of
these which appears to have been written by Mr Long, a district officer
attached to the Sydney office as at
6 April 1984.  The entry is as follows:
<P>

	<i>"[HF] seen in office.  Advised that I had discussed his case with other
staff and had thoroughly read the file.  The usual conversation
took place with
the old allegations being rehashed again.  The interview terminated with me
advising [HF] that I was satisfied that
all YACS investigations had been
carried out thoroughly and that I would not be removing Louise Boulter from the
case.  He left not
too happy but not overly distressed."</i>
<P>

418	At first glance this document may be thought to attract the same criticism
as I have made of Mr Banks.  However the entry indicates
that what Mr Long was
addressing was a request that Ms Boulter be taken off the case.  I read the
entry as indicating that when seen
HF only restated complaints already
considered in the file that Mr Long had read.  I am not persuaded upon
reflection that the entry
is demonstrative of failure on the part of the author
to duly address the request made.
<P>

	<b>Mr Langshaw</b>
<P>

419	It has been submitted that Exhibit A(bb) reflects bias by the then Director
General, Mr Langshaw.  The file note bears date
27 March 1983 and I set out its
content:
<P>

	<i>"Father has access to his son.  His address is 426 Avoca Street,
Kingsford.</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] made several complaints to the electoral office of Mr P. Whelan former
Minister for Consumer Affairs in October 1982 and also
visited the office of
the former Minister, Mr K. Stewart.  He proved to be so rude and aggressive and
was so abusive of staff that
when officers reported that the mother appeared to
be adequately caring for her son, the former Minister decided to take no
further
action on [HF's] complaints.</i>
<P>

<i>	There have been further complaints in February 1983 when [HM] was in Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital receiving treatment for the extensive
burns she suffered
in 1982 when her car was blown up (she alleges at the instance of her
husband).</i>
<P>

<i>	[HM] has been visited last on 7 March 83.  There is no evidence of neglect
and the child seemed happy and well cared for.  There
are no grounds for
intervention by this Department and the father has custody proceedings before
the Family Court of Australia. 
</i>
<P>

<i>	Departmental papers are attached.  No action is recommended."</i>
<P>

420	What is relied upon as indicating bias is the last sentence of the second
paragraph.
<P>

421	I do not find that this document establishes bias in the author.  What he
has done in the second paragraph is to indicate what
the outcome was of HF's
complaints to the former Minister for Consumer Affairs and to the former
Minister, Mr Stewart.  Of apparent
significance to the outcome of those
complaints was the advice that HF appeared to be caring adequately for TC.
<P>

422	In the next two paragraphs the author has recorded that there were further
complaints and that HM had been then recently visited.
 The document records
the findings at that time.  I am mindful of the deficiencies of the
investigations that I find should have
taken place in February and March 1983,
but I am unable to conclude that what Mr Langshaw wrote was tainted by bias.
<P>

	<b>Mr Lungley</b>
<P>

423	There are two exhibits which it is submitted disclose bias in this officer:
Exhibit A(rrr) and Exhibit A(xxx).
<P>

424	The first of those exhibits is a three page typed document that records a
number of events occurring during the period from
31 May 1984 to 29 June 1984.
The entry relied upon is an entry for 29 June 1984 and that is a note following
a telephone conversation
which Mr Lungley apparently had with a police officer
to whom HF went to complain that HM had sexually abused TC.  The police officer
wanted to interview HM and TC.  The note upon which this submission focuses
reads:
<P>

	<i>"DO declined, after discussion with A/DM T. Long to furnish address over
phone and suggested CMU [the police officer] make a request
in writing."</i>
<P>

425	Mr Lungley was not called and neither was Mr Long.  The reason for not
giving the police officer the address of HM over the
telephone is not apparent
but I would not be justified in concluding that the requirement that the
request be made in writing was
indicative of bias.  There may have been very
good reason for the making of that request.
<P>

426	Exhibit A(xxx) is a very lengthy report dated 31 July 1984.  It may be
described as a summary of events, particularly over then
recent times, and an
assessment and a case plan.  It seems to have been prepared by Mr Lungley for
Mrs Burgess.  I have of course
considered the document in its entirety.  It is
submitted that the document contains an irrelevant assertion that many of the
female
officers of the department were lesbians.  It is appropriate to consider
the context in which that assertion is recorded:
<P>

	<i>"The pre-school had had contact with [HF] some eight weeks previously, and
among other matters discussed were [TC's] aggressiveness,
and his behaviour
towards women.  [HF] claimed that [TC] was behaving suggestively, and blamed
his wife [HM] for this, stating that
she was a lesbian and that [TC] was
learning this behaviour from her.</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] has also claimed that many of the female officers in the Department of
Youth and Community Services are lesbians, and are sympathetic
towards his wife
whom he has also claimed to be a lesbian.  [HF] made these claims in an
interview with the SDO of Sydney CWO, Mr
Trevor Long, on 21.3.84." </i>
<P>

427	On my reading of the document it was relevant in context for Mr Lungley to
record the assertions HF was making about the departmental
officers.  He was
asserting that because HM was a lesbian and the officers were lesbians they
were taking her side rather than his.
 I certainly do not conclude, viewing the
document as a whole, that it establishes any bias on the part of Mr Lungley and
the submission
to that effect is rejected.
<P>

	<b>Mr Heagney</b>
<P>

428	In support of the submission that Mr Heagney was biased attention is
directed to Exhibit A(abr).  This is a document to which
I have already made
reference in considering the advice Mr Heagney gave against taking proceedings
in the Children's Court.  It contains
the following sentence attracting the
submission of bias:
<P>

	<i>"It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that [TC] was instructed in
this behaviour by [HF]."</i>
<P>

429	That sentence of course has to be viewed in context.  So viewed, it seems
to me, that all the author is doing is to look at
the probative value of the
available evidence and to point to one possible explanation for TC's behaviour
with the psychologist.
 Mr Heagney is not asserting in the statement that HF
did instruct TC to make the assertion to the psychologist.
<P>

430	The exhibit itself does not warrant a finding of bias.  I have had the
opportunity of seeing Mr Heagney and reviewing the evidence
that he gave in
this Court, and I entertain no concern that this witness was other than
objective and impartial in his approach to
this case. 
<P>

	<b>Mr Shelston</b>
<P>

431	It is submitted that this witness is biased because of the content of a
file note Exhibit A(abb).  That document is a handwritten
note which purports
to be signed by Ken Shelston from the district office at Sydney.  The note on
the face of it relates to a telephone
conversation with he had with one Lyn
Perkins, a child welfare officer at Stanmore.  The note reads:
<P>

	<i>"Has received notification through Ethnic Project Officer that [TC] is `at
risk' with mother.  Sexual &amp; physical abuse.</i>
<P>

<i>	Father had approached the Project Officer and made allegations.  Has
apparently got supporting documentation which will be sent to
Montrose.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mother &amp; child allegedly at Marrickville Women's Refuge but I thought
they live at Waterloo.</i>
<P>

<i>	Information known to this officer was relayed to Lyn who was wondering
whether to do urgent call-out.</i>
<P>

<i>	Only information available to this office is that of hearsay at office and
attached papers from Bankstown CWO.  [HF] is known to
have made many complaints
and those have been investigated in the past.  The child is the `pawn' is a
very bitter custody battle.</i>
<P>

<i>	I advised Lyn to speak to DM if she needed more info. as I have only had
this case nominally for this week."</i>
<P>

432	It was submitted that I should conclude that Mr Shelston was biased because
of what was written in the second last paragraph
above.  I do not consider I
would be justified in reaching that conclusion.  What Mr Shelston appears to
have told Ms Perkins, if
the note is accurate, is that he had no first hand
information about this case but as far as he knew all past complaints had been
investigated.  I do not consider the observation that the child was a <i>"pawn
in a very bitter custody battle"</i> as indicating bias one way or the other.
The note concluded with a recommendation that the "C" file be located and that
the district
manager note what had occurred.  There is then a footnote
indicating that  Mr Shelston had a later discussion with Ms Perkins.  Whether
that was after the file had been located and if so what was discussed I do not
know.
<P>

433	I referred earlier to Mr Shelston's involvement in this matter once he
began to make home visits in May 1985.  Nothing in what
Mr Shelston wrote after
such involvement began persuades me that this officer was biased and the
submission is rejected.
<P>

	<b>Ms Withers</b>
<P>

434	It is submitted that I should infer that Ms Withers was biased because
Exhibit A(abg) records that at a case conference on 23
August 1984 she said:
<i>"I have some problems accepting what [HF] says for obvious reasons."</i>
That remark has to be viewed in the context of the lengthy document in which it
appears and in which many utterances are attributed
to Ms Withers.  Those
utterances, in my opinion, indicate that Ms Withers was searching for the
truth.  The conference was held to
respond to the notification of sexual abuse
and at that conference Ms Withers and Ms Ralston reported at length on their
inquiries
and Ms Withers expressed the opinion that the child had been sexually
abused.  She expressed the opinion that the teachers at TC's
school were very
biased towards HM.
<P>

435	Subsequently to the case conference Ms Withers swore an affidavit for the
purposes of the proceedings in the Family Court to
which she annexed her
report, concluding:  
<P>

	<i>"From my twelve years experience as a clinical psychologist and in
particular my two years experience in the Department of Youth and
Community
Services specialising in children who have been abused and neglected; from my
discussion with Ms Greta Goldberg in whom
[TC] confided instances of sexual
`games'; from the extensive literature on the symptomatology of child sexual
abuse; and from my
two interviews with [TC] I conclude that he is an
emotionally deprived child who has been sexually abused and has been exposed to
adult sexual behaviour."</i>
<P>

436	Ms Withers was not called in the proceedings before me but the exhibits do
not indicate bias and the submission under consideration
is rejected.
<P>

	<b>Mr Callaghan</b>
<P>

437	Mr Callaghan was not called as a witness in this case but it is submitted
that bias on his part is demonstrated by what he wrote
in Exhibit A(agg).  That
document bears date 22 January 1985.  It appears to have been directed to the
legal branch of the department.
 The document is a historical narrative with
particular emphasis on events after July 1984 when the allegations of sexual
abuse had
surfaced.  Plainly to consider this submission of bias the document
has to be read in its entirety and it is also to be read with
other documents
of which Mr Callaghan was the author, particularly documents in the latter part
of 1984 and early 1985; indeed the
allegation should be considered in the
context of what occurred and of what Mr Callaghan did and wrote from the time
consideration
was first being given either to starting proceedings in the
Children's Court or intervening in the Family Court.
<P>

438	All the material in point is persuasive of Mr Callaghan's resolve to have
court proceedings to see whether TC had been sexually
abused and if so by
whom.
<P>

439	Returning to Exhibit A(agg) the document records:
<P>

	<i>"[HF] and [HM] and [TC] have been seen by Doctor B. Waters, RAHC, who
concluded that [TC] has been sexually abused but in his opinion
[HM] was not
the perpetrator.  This is the only opinion offered to exonerate [HM].</i>
<P>

<i>	This is a complex case and in view of the conflicting evidence it is
considered that a court appearance is necessary to resolve the
situation.  The
regional position is that [TC] should be removed from his mother's care to
enable a psycho-social assessment to be
effected at Brougham, such assessment
allowing full access to [HM].  This access is essential to gauge the
interaction between [HM]
and the child.</i>
<P>

<i>	The Registrar, Family Law Court, is now awaiting certificates of readiness
from all parties concerned; once these have been submitted
a date of hearing
will be allocated.  [HF] has asked that the Department withdraw from the case
as he feels a swifter resolution
will be obtained without our `interference'.
He is, however, wavering in this position.</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] is an aggressive, abusive person who has threatened departmental
officers and Mr Keating, the Treasurer.  [HF] has been investigated
by the Bomb
Task Force in connection with the bombing of Judges' homes and Family Law
Courts and has been absolved from guilt.  He
has however been on the periphery
of incidents which cause suspicion.  [HM] was disfigured after a caf&eacute; in
which she was dining
was firebombed, a worker's car at Marrickville Women's
Refuge where [HM] was staying was firebombed and a solicitor who was dismissed
by [HF] received a letter bomb.  [HF] has had approximately twenty
solicitors.</i>
<P>

<i>	In order to hear the basic evidence quickly, I believe that the Department
should seek a live-in assessment and that only the evidence
needed to proceed
on this be heard in the first instance."</i>
<P>

440	It is the second last paragraph above which it is submitted demonstrates
bias.  I do not agree.  It seems to be clear that Mr
Callaghan was wishing to
emphasise in the document the complexity of the problems which the case
presented and the desirability of
having the issues determined.  The conduct of
HF was, in Mr Callaghan's perception, as I understand the document, a relevant
consideration
in the need to have the hearing expedited.  There were many
documents on file when Exhibit A(agg) was written that supported the
assertions
of aggression and abuse.  I do not propose to refer to those documents in
detail but I identify the following exhibits
as being in point: Exhibits A(c),
A(n), A(v), A(bb), A(pp), A(rr), A(ww), A(ggg), A(hhh), A(kkk), A(xxx), A(aby),
A(ace), A(acm),
A(acn), A(acr), A(ada), A(adj), A(afa), A(afe), A(afl), A(afo),
A(afx), A(agd), A(agq), M and 8.
<P>

441	Whilst what was written by Mr Callaghan was unfavourable to HF, this does
not demonstrate that Mr Callaghan was diverted from
what he perceived to be the
purpose of the pending proceedings, namely to endeavour to determine the
perpetrator of any sexual abuse
of TC.
<P>

442	The evidence does not justify a finding that Mr Callaghan was biased and I
reject that submission accordingly.
<P>

	<b>Ms Boulter</b>
<P>

443	I earlier identified the period of this officer's involvement in TC's case.
It began in May 1983 and her last home visit was
on 28 June 1984.  Ms Boulter
later participated in case conferences in the latter half of 1984.
<P>

444	In support of the submission that Ms Boulter was biased in her approach to
this case, a number of documents have been identified
and I must consider them
in turn.
<P>

445	The earliest of these documents is a handwritten note dated 17 May 1983
(Exhibit A(jj)) in which Ms Boulter recorded notes of
a telephone conversation
she had with Dr Kakakios in relation to the notification concerning scratches
after HF had taken TC to see
Dr Kakakios.  Ms Boulter recorded what Dr Kakakios
told her, and that included that HF was <i>"full of complaints"</i> and
impressed as <i>"a bit odd"</i>.
<P>

446	No justifiable inference of bias could be drawn from the form of this note
which simply purports to evidence what the doctor
had said.
<P>

447	On the following day, 18 May 1983, Ms Boulter made a home visit and Exhibit
A(kk) recorded, inter alia, what Ms Boulter observed
that day.  The exhibit is
a detailed three page report and it deals with the author's observations and
assessment.  The criticism
of the report in the current context focuses on the
first paragraph:
<P>

	<i>"[HM] looks considerably older than her (approx.) 20 years and has major
disfigurement on her neck, lower jawline and hands (as far
as could be seen)
due to burns received when a petrol bomb was thrown at her at a Marrickville
club.  Her husband was apparently
a police suspect in this bombing, [HM] was
quite receptive to officers visiting, although she resents having to accept
repeated YACS
`investigations', necessary after each notification.  [TC] is a
small boy for his age, very lively and very responsive too, to relative
strangers.  He seems quite at ease with his mother."</i>
<P>

448	In considering any allegation of bias where attention is drawn to a
particular passage in a document, it is always necessary
to place the passage
in context.  It seems to me to have been reasonable that the above paragraph
was included in the report.  The
history of the relationship between a mother
and a father, and particularly the existence of hostility between them, must be
a relevant
consideration for a social welfare worker concerned to address the
interests of the child of that relationship.  One area of relevance
is in
addressing the veracity of complaints by one parent about another's treatment
of that child, particularly in the context of
ongoing disputes over custody and
access.
<P>

449	Exhibit A(mm) is part of a Child at Risk notification completed by Ms
Boulter on 10 June 1983.  It appears to relate to the
very same matter as was
the subject of the notification by Dr Kakakios about the scratches on TC.
However it is submitted that Exhibit
A(mm) indicates bias because Ms Boulter
wrote:
<P>

	<i>"As with all previous notifications over past two years, no substance found
to father's allegations.  Don't register."</i>
<P>

450	I am satisfied by Ms Boulter's evidence that there was a conscientious
investigation made by her, in conjunction with Mr Hanrahan,
about the complaint
referred to in Exhibit A(mm).  I am satisfied that Ms Boulter reached the
conclusion conscientiously that there
was no substance in the most recent
complaint.  The notification <i>"Don't register"</i> was a recommendation
against registration at Montrose, but not against keeping a record of the
notification and its investigation
in the then current YACS file.
<P>

451	I do not consider that the reference to the earlier investigations having
been unsubstantiated indicated bias, but rather it
comprised a record of the
earlier history as Ms Boulter understood it.  However Ms Boulter was not
involved in the earlier investigations
and it is regrettable that the
investigations concerning the cot incident were recorded as
<i>"unsubstantiated"</i>.  I addressed that elsewhere.  Nevertheless, I do not
regard the statement complained of in Exhibit A(mm) as disclosing bias, because
I am satisfied it followed a conscientious consideration of the complaint which
the witness had just undertaken.
<P>

452	Exhibit A(nn) is a handwritten file note relating to a telephone
conversation with Dr Rose.  It reads in part:
<P>

	<i>"Father brought [TC] to C &amp; F Psych. Dept. wanting an assessment - 1st
did so in Oct/Nov '82 but Dr did not proceed because no
Court approval.  Fa
brought him again and Dr concerned at child's presentation.  </i><cite>Dr has
recognized father is v. difficult to handle &amp; is totally preoccupied with
child</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

453	I reject the submission that that entry, and in particular the part
underlined, reveals bias on Ms Boulter's part.  It seems
to me that it is no
more than a record of the doctor's assessment and I consider it was both proper
and relevant to record what the
doctor said.
<P>

454	Exhibit A(pp) is a three page typed document prepared by Ms Boulter.  It
deals with a home visit on 16 June 1983 which was made,
the author records,
after HM had complained that HF was harassing her.  It also deals with an
interview with HF in the office of
YACS on the same day.  The document
contained the following paragraph by way of assessment of HF following that
interview:
<P>

	<i>"[HF] impressed as obsessed with [TC] and still involved with his wife,
despite protestations to the contrary.  The intensity of his
dialogue and lack
of any ability to accept the Officers input, impressed as quite disturbed.  He
became more excited and aggressive
at any querying of his statements and
indicates little capacity to negotiate.  Overall he impressed as a determined,
emotionally
ill person who may well persist with his allegations despite (even
because of) any Family Law Court decision."</i>
<P>

455	Unquestionably the above paragraph reflects an unfavourable opinion of HF
but I do not conclude that it was other than the opinion
then held by Ms
Boulter.  Whether because Ms Boulter so regarded HF prevented her from reacting
properly to complaints is, of course,
a different matter and warrants close
scrutiny of the relevant evidence.
<P>

456	Exhibit A(rr) is again a typed report prepared by Ms Boulter which extends
over some five pages.  It addresses a number of issues
including a home visit
on 21 June 1983, a recent assessment of TC by Dr Rose, and a visit HF made to
the office of YACS.  The author
recorded, following this visit, the
following:
<P>

	<i>"[HF] presented in the same manner and reiterating the same old complaints
as during original interview with SDO and CPW 16.6.83.
 A/ASDO attempted to
explain the responsibilities and constraints of the Child Welfare Act, but [HF]
remained adamant that he wanted
[TC] in a place of safety until custody
settled.  He furthermore wanted YACS to interview those making affidavits in
his support
but was advised the Family Law Court was the appropriate arena.
[HF] was incensed by CPW's comment that [TC] does not show fear of
his mother.
He accused CPW of being a lesbian, `slammed' the table, swore, and hurriedly
left."</i>
<P>

457	It is submitted that bias is reflected in the above extract.  I am not
persuaded that this is so.  I have earlier considered
the question as to
whether there ought to have been interviews of those persons identified by HF
in February 1983.  I have found
that there should have been.  However I do not
consider the unwillingness of Ms Boulter to become involved in interviewing the
deponents
referred to at this stage is indicative of bias.  The affidavits had
been filed in the Family Court for the purposes of proceedings
then current in
the Family Court and I accept that Ms Boulter understood that the subject
matter had been considered earlier by the
department and that nothing in the
affidavits amounted to fresh concerns.
<P>

458	In the same exhibit there is a reference to the concern which Ms Boulter
expressed to a police officer about <i>"the violence and unpredictability of
[HF]"</i>.  The note relates to events on 28 June 1983 when Ms Boulter went to
HM's home and saw HF there:
<P>

	<i>"[HM] out at doctor's, and officers discussed situation with a Judith
Curran who was awaiting [HF's] arrival with [TC].</i>
<P>

<i>	She relayed general concerns re [HF's] mental state and conveyed her
determination to withstand his hostility since she feels it
is part of his
tactic to alienate [HM's] friends as a punitive gesture.  She stated that all
the Refuge workers support [HM].</i>
<P>

<i>	[HF] came to the door with [TC] who, contrary to Syrian custom and [HM's]
wishes, had had his hair cut short during [HF's] access.
 Judith said: `You
shouldn't have cut his hair, [HF]' for which she received a torrent of verbal
and sexually-aggressive abuse which
quickly ceased when he realized visitors
were present (though he did not see who).  Judith was upset at that and
haircut, knowing
[HM] would be, but calmed herself and had the capacity to hide
her upset from [TC] who commenced playing unperturbed.  [TC] responded
very
warmly and quickly to Mr Thredgold, saying he'd had a good day with his
father.</i>
<P>

<i>	Judith impressed as sensible, and supportive to [HM], understanding her
predicament and able to continue backup.</i>
<P>

<i>	CPW and A/ASDO visited Redfern Police:</i>
<P>

<i>	Spoke with a Senior Constable Soames who took details of YACS concern re
[HF's] violence and unpredictability, and said he'd visit
and patrol near
flat.</i>
<P>

<i>	On return to office, CPW contacted [HM] to convey that police would visit
about which she was pleased.  She was upset about haircut
and again feels
harassed by [HF].  [HM] seems to be increasingly desperate in the situation,
and the time up to and including the
court case will be very demanding."</i>
<P>

459	Contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of the plaintiff, I do not
regard Ms Boulter's behaviour in going to the police
station in the
circumstances above outlined as being indicative of bias, nor do I regard the
subsequent note as being so indicative.
 I accept that the witness genuinely
considered that what had taken place at HM's unit warranted the action which
was taken subsequently.
 I so conclude having regard to the evidence about this
matter that Ms Boulter gave (T2311 and following).
<P>

460	Reference was made to other passages in the evidence on the topic of HF and
violence.  Ms Boulter was asked these questions
and gave these answers at
T2313:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  I will ask you this question now.  In respect of allegations about
threats of violence which he is supposed to have made, or
violence that he
committed, proved to be unsubstantiated; did that prove to be unsubstantiated
so far as you were concerned?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well I think some proved to be unsubstantiated and some inconclusive
and I think what my feeling about it at the time was I had
seen Mr HF a number
of times very verbally aggressive and unable to have dialogue about any matter
unless I was agreeing with him
totally.  I have never had a dialogue with him
when he was able to be relatively calm.  He would escalate very quickly and so
sometimes
was abusive to me verbally.  That was the evidence, if you like, to
me that he could be volatile and at least verbally aggressive.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Do you mean that he may do something violent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.  If someone is screaming abuse at you and slamming the desk in a
small office one could think he might be violent.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Do you happen to remember if there was a theme in discussion on those
occasions when he was verbally aggressive?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  There were several themes.  The major one was he felt his son was being
abused, and other feelings were that his ex wife was
a lesbian and any woman,
including myself, who disagreed with him had the same description made of them.
A fairly anti female presentation
to me.  That was a fairly strong
theme."</i>
<P>

461	It was submitted that Ms Boulter's perception that HF could be violent
caused her to be biased.  Ms Boulter denied in cross
examination that the
propensity she perceived in HF caused her to treat his allegations with doubt
(T 2312).  Her evidence in this
regard I treat as truthful.
<P>

462	Exhibit A(ww) was prepared by Ms Boulter on 8 August 1983 and records her
support for the placement of TC in pre school on a
daily basis.  The document
records details of TC's disrupted family background and contains the following
paragraph:
<P>

	<i>"[HM] has been under extreme stress since separation from her husband
suffered extensive burns to her upper body in a fire in Marrickville
early in
1982.  Though no one was charged from that fire, [HF] was a prime police
suspect.  Both [HM] and myself consider pre-school
attendance for a full-week,
close to home would be very advantageous."</i>
<P>

463	Like Exhibit A(pp) this document reflects the unfavourable opinion Ms
Boulter had formed of HF and by way of contrast her sympathy
for HM.  It does
not follow, however, that Ms Boulter's actions and decisions were necessarily
tainted by bias; the question always
to be asked when considering the actions
of this witness is whether she approached successive problems that arose with
an open mind.
<P>

464	Exhibit A(jjj) is a handwritten file note recording Ms Boulter's
conversation with Mr Hampson on 11 May 1984 after HF had taken
TC to the Prince
of Wales Hospital complaining that HM had sucked his penis.  I considered this
earlier and I will not repeat the
substance of what I wrote at para 322 and
following.
<P>

465	Exhibit A(afl) is a lengthy report which contains entries for a number of
dates.  The first of relevance in the present context
is an entry for 22
December 1983 which reads:
<P>

	<i>"22.12.83.  Teresa Lee (Psychologist, Bankstown Child Health Centre, phoned
CPW - [HF] came into Centre saying child very disturbed
and wanting assessment.
Made appointment for child to see a psychologist later - 6.1.83. (John Raue).
[HF] showed a letter saying
child needs ongoing treatment.  Father stating
child abused since birth and demanding psychologist has to see child.
</i><cite>CPW clarified background and that no substance found in father's
repeated allegations</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Dr Yunan saw child for [HF] (for Court).</i>
<P>

<i>	[TC] - said in office he'd kill a child at school when he grows up.
Expressed inappropriate violent remarks.</i>
<P>

<i>	Plan:  1.	Teresa will see [HF] tomorrow - expects him to come in again.
</i><cite>Will try and deflect him as seems no point in extending his
contacts</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	         2.	[HF] to return child for assessment on 6.1.84."</i>
<P>

466	The above underlined sentences are those which it is submitted reflect
bias.  I do not agree.  The earlier of these sentences
I am satisfied reflects
Ms Boulter's genuine understanding that the allegations that had been made by
HF were without substance.
 So far as the second of the underlined sentences is
concerned, the arrangements which were in place were that a psychologist was
to
see TC on 6 January 1984.  The decision by Ms Lee that in these circumstances
visits to the Bankstown Child Health Care Centre
in the interim should be
discouraged does not demonstrate bias by Ms Boulter.
<P>

467	Also in the same exhibit Ms Boulter has recorded a discussion which she had
with the solicitor acting for HM dealing with the
proceedings in the Family
Court.  I quote from the document:
<P>

	<i>"CPW discussed with Glenys Pernu (C P Andrews &amp; Associates, 922 6222).
Apparently Adrian Ford did not want to give any comments
to lawyer.</i>
<P>

<i>	Family Court Counsellor (Alex Schzik) - saw [HM] today.  Child not afraid
of mother, and child wanted to go home with mother.  Considered
[HF]
obsessive-compulsive, a `fanatic'.  [HF] would deny all reality of mother and
son getting on well.</i>
<P>

<i>	Psychologists:</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Goard, who father sought out, wants to have mother and son assessed.
</i>
<P>

<i>	Greta Goldberg (Private Psychologist who saw father and son and thought
father mad.)  Her report tendered in an affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	Glenys Pernu advised Mr Goard to speak with Greta and with Family Court
Counsellor.</i>
<P>

<i>	Arson Squad - believe [HF] was responsible for fire in Marrickville Night
club.</i>
<P>

<i>	- believe [HF] involved in Pamela Dahl Helm's car being blow up in August
1983 (she was a Social Worker at the Refuge).</i>
<P>

<i>	- two of [HF's] solicitors got bomb threats."</i>
<P>

468	I do not accept the submission that by recording the above detail of her
conversation with HM's solicitor Ms Boulter was demonstrating
bias.  It seems
to me to have been appropriate for her to record that detail in the same way as
she recorded other events that had
occurred in the period covered by this
report form.
<P>

469	The final matter to which attention has been directed in Exhibit A(afl)
relates to what is recorded as to a telephone conversation
which Ms Boulter had
with Mr Goard, the psychologist who, at the relevant time, was making
assessments of both parents as well as
TC.  The note reveals that Ms Boulter
spoke to the psychologist, responding to his telephone call.  The exhibit
records:
<P>

	<i>"...CPW conveyed that Departmental investigation by several Officers had
not revealed any substance to complaints.  She also stated
that both parents
had been seen (separately) by herself and several other Officers and that [HM],
although stressed at times, was
never irrational and a dialogue was always
possible.  This differed markedly to the behaviour of [HF] who was irrational,
heated,
very angry and abusive."</i>
<P>

470	Mr Goard in the course of this conversation informed Ms Boulter of
psychological test results and of his assessment and those
details have been
recorded.
<P>

471	It is apparent from the document that Mr Goard was seeking information from
Ms Boulter as a social worker involved in TC's case.
 It was appropriate to
assist the psychologist and that he be informed of the results of
investigations, and whilst what Ms Boulter
conveyed to Ms Goard about HF was
unfavourable by way of contrast with what she said about HM, I am not persuaded
that in passing
on these assessments Ms Boulter was displaying bias in the
relevant sense.
<P>

472	Ms Boulter said in evidence that she saw HF approximately four or five
times (T2315); she said she saw HM and TC together <i>"maybe fifteen
times"</i>.  She was cross examined about her assessment of HF's allegations in
a passage to which it is appropriate to refer in the present
context
(T2315-2316):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  In your presence did he not complain that the Department did nothing
by way of response to his claims that the child was being
neglected?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I think that is fair to say, that he claimed that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Would you agree so far as you are concerned you did not respond
sympathetically to any of those complaints?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I don't agree with that at all.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You think we can find some evidence in the records that involved you as
though you did react sympathetically to that, can we?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I think you can find evidence of follow up of those allegations of
abuse and neglect that Mr HF made in trying to establish whether
his son was
being ill cared for by HM.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You never formed a view in your own mind there was any truth about the
allegation he made about the child being abused or neglected
by his
mother?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I didn't form a view.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Never, right through to the end of your contact with this matter.  That
is correct, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I think it is broadly correct.  I certainly was concerned about her
stress level and being able to adequately meet TC's full
needs for nurturing in
the environment she was in.  But the specific allegations were not - on a
number of occasions that I saw her
and saw her with TC and TC inter reacting
with her, I never saw any substance to verify the concerns that he had in terms
of how
the child reacted to her, how she responded to him, how she disciplined
him.  I just didn't see that.</i>
<P>

<i>	I spent time every day, almost, going out to notifications of child abuse
or neglect so I considered I was very skilled at observing
and noticing if the
relationship was awry or if the child had been maltreated by a care giver and
in the contact that I had with
[HM] it was not evident to me.</i>
<P>

<i>	HIS HONOUR:  Q.  How many times would you have seen the mother with the
child together?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I have not added it up from the file but maybe fifteen, maybe no.  And
sometimes I would spend, you know, I was there for quite
a lengthy period, an
hour to an hour and a half talking to her, talking to TC, observing
them.</i>
<P>

<i>	SHAND:  Q.  I have to wait, is that the end of your answer?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I was there observing them and I did not see substance to what was
alleged."</i>
<P>

473	I accept the evidence above extracted as being reliable.
<P>

474	Whilst I find that early in her involvement in this matter Ms Boulter
formed an unfavourable opinion of HF and a favourable
opinion of HM, I do not
conclude upon consideration of all the evidence in point that Ms Boulter was
biased in her investigation
and assessment of any matter concerning the welfare
of TC.  Ms Boulter did not make inquiries about the affidavits HF first
produced
to Mr Finch and I have addressed the shortcomings of the
investigations in February 1983.  However, starting with her response to
the
scratches reported by Dr Kakakios, I am satisfied that Ms Boulter considered
fresh complaints with an open mind.
<P>

	<b><u>The expert evidence considered</u></b>
<P>

475	Professor Oates was called in the plaintiff's case.  I am satisfied that he
is a highly qualified medical practitioner with
particular qualifications and
experience in child protection matters.  Indeed, his qualifications were not
challenged and they are
recorded in his report, Exhibit LL.  In that report,
which formed the core of his evidence, Professor Oates responded to a series
of
questions that had been posed for his consideration.  For the purposes of his
report, the professor had been provided with certain
of the material introduced
in evidence in this case, but not all of it.  The material Professor Oates
considered included the following:
 the affidavits of Georgina Daskalopoulos,
Joanna Papakonstantinou, Margaret Denley, Penny Tokatlidis and Mrs Blevnik; Mrs
Blevnik's
handwritten statements; the affidavits of Greta Goldberg and Peggy
Brunner; Dr Grunseit's report and the hospital notes relating
to his
involvement; Mr Goard's reports; and Ms Brant's reports.
<P>

476	I set out certain of the questions which the plaintiff's solicitors
addressed to the professor together with his responses which
are to be found in
his report:
<P>

	<i>"Q5.4		On the basis of my expertise and experience in the area of child
welfare, should a person in the position of a YACS officer
in possession of the
evidence reasonably have formed the view that the plaintiff was at real risk of
serious emotional and psychological
damage, whilst in the custody of his
mother, by any of the following dates:</i>
<P>

<i>	December 1982?</i>
<P>

<i>	March 1983?</i>
<P>

<i>	May 1984?</i>
<P>

<i>	May 1985?</i>
<P>

<i>	A5.4		I believe that a well trained YACS officer in possession of the
evidence should have reasonably formed the view that the plaintiff
was at-risk,
not so much of long term psychological damage, but more importantly in terms of
further episodes of neglect and abuse.
 This is because these episodes are only
occasionally `one-off' instances, but are often repeated unless the child can
be given appropriate
protection and this was known in the early 1980's.  Such
protection may involve at one extreme removal of the child from the parents
to
be cared for instead by foster parents (provided that they have the appropriate
qualities to meet the child's emotional needs
and that the fostering is a long
term one), or at the other end of the spectrum, providing appropriate support
for the parents to
assist them to understand their child's needs so that they
can provide appropriate parenting.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q5.5		On the basis of my expertise and experience in the area of child
welfare, did the evidence placed in the possession of YACS
provide a sufficient
basis to take steps to remove the plaintiff from the care of his mother, by any
of the following dates:</i>
<P>

<i>	December 1982?</i>
<P>

<i>	May 1983?</i>
<P>

<i>	November 1983?</i>
<P>

<i>	May 1984?</i>
<P>

<i>	May 1985?</i>
<P>

<i>	A5.5		I believe that the accumulation of episodes of abuse during the
period 1982-1985 would have been sufficient for the Department
of Youth and
Community Services to take appropriate steps to take the child before the
Children's Court so that a determination about
the child's safety could be
made.</i>
<P>

<i>	By March 1983 there was:</i>
<P>

<i>		A medically documented episode, noted by a paediatrician experienced in
child abuse assessments, to show that the child had been
deliberately scratched
on the face by a person's fingernails.</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	The availability of 2 affidavits saying that the child had been seen
tied to his cot in the refuge.</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	The availability of an affidavit stating that the child's mother had
been verbally abusive to him, often hitting him to keep
him quiet, including
hitting him on the face with an open hand (the child being less than 3 years of
age at this time).</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	By August 1983 there was the availability of handwritten statements
by persons observing the child and caring for it of sophisticated
adult sexual
behaviour.</i>
<P>

<i>	These 4 separate incidents should have been sufficient to warrant YACS
officers investigating the allegations further, interviewing
the relevant
parties and making a decision as to whether to take the child before the
Children's Court to determine the degree of
risk to the child and the need for
an alternative placement to ensure his safety.</i>
<P>

<i>	By May 1984 there was further evidence, provided in an assessment by a
clinical psychologist, that the child was showing sexual behaviour
which was
strongly suggestive that he had been involved in sexual activity with an adult.
This alone would be grounds for appropriate
steps being taken to investigate
the cause of the behaviour and to protect the child.  Combined with the
previous episodes of physical
abuse and neglect, the situation should have been
regarded even more seriously.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q5.6		Did the evidence placed in the possession of YACS provide a
sufficient basis to take any other steps, and if so, what other
steps?</i>
<P>

<i>	A5.6		The evidence provided to YACS was sufficient for action to be taken
to protect the child.  This is summarised in a report of
Mr Bruce Callaghan,
Regional Director, Central Metropolitan Region, on 21/8/84, where he believed
that there was a strong case that
the child had been abused and that there were
indications that the Department should take action to take the child into
care."</i>
<P>

477	Professor Oates made it clear in his evidence in Court that he assumed that
the material with which he had been provided, including
the affidavits and
statements I have identified above, was correct, that is to say that he assumed
that the information in those
documents was true (T1080 and T1159).
<P>

478	Of the evidence Professor Oates considered, he was not aware that Mr
Hanrahan had investigated the scratches complaint addressed
by Dr Grunseit and
he had not seen Exhibit A(e), being Mr Hanrahan's report into his
investigations.  Having been referred to that
report, Professor Oates said of
the investigation reflected in that document:  <i>"That looks like a reasonable
investigation"</i> (T1148).
<P>

479	The professor's attention was drawn to the evidence that TC had apparently
given one answer as to the source of the scratches
to Dr Grunseit and a
differing answer as to the source of the scratches to Mr Hanrahan, and that
provoked the response which appears
at T1149:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  If you assume as I think you would do that Dr Grunseit is an
independently impartial witness who would be answering truthfully
and correctly
and Mr Hanrahan has the same character, the child has given to the doctor an
answer in the presence of the father it
was done by the mother and given to
Hanrahan in the presence of the mother the answer it was done by
Michael?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  That would suggest, wouldn't it, that the child is capable of being
manipulative?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I think it is an example of the child going with the flow really.
Children of particularly the age I think this child would have
been, four,
three, at that age is very easy for children to be influenced by
parents."</i>
<P>

480	The further assumption reflected in A5.5 that YACS was aware by August 1983
of the Blevnik statements is an assumption contrary
to the factual finding I
have earlier expressed in the course of this judgment.
<P>

481	Nevertheless it is noteworthy that although Professor Oates assumed the
truth of each of the matters identified in A5.5, he
did not conclude that
either independently or cumulatively they necessarily called for action to
remove TC from HM, but rather that
they called for the making of investigations
and then deciding whether to proceed to court.
<P>

482	In his oral evidence, Professor Oates said that where he had nominated the
Children's Court in A5.5 of his report, he did so
<i>"based upon the practice
he believed to have been followed in the past" </i>(T1139).
<P>

483	Referring to the answer 5.5 in the course of cross examination, Professor
Oates gave the following answers to the following
questions (T1140):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Let me make it clear, I do not wish to confuse you and I want to make
the position as between us perfectly clear.  You say here,
investigate, I
understand that, that is in the second last paragraph, then you say `Make a
decision'.  Now you do not say which way
that decision should go in that
paragraph, do you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What you say is go and investigate and when you have made your
investigation, then you make your decision, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Based on the facts of the investigation."</i>
<P>

484	Professor Oates was later asked about the decision making process in cases
of alleged child abuse at T1151-1152:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  In making a decision as to what steps ought to be taken when these
particular matters of abuse or alleged abuse took place before
the Department,
they would be entitled to have regard to all these matters that I have been
putting to you, wouldn't they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And in the end, what one has to do is to make a judgment, don't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And you make the judgment on the basis of all the relevant material
that you can get?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That is right.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And I would assume, doctor, that you will frequently find that you have
conflicting material?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, certainly these judgments are always difficult.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Difficult to make?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. When I say obviously, in a case where the father is alleging that the
wife is abusing the child in some way or other and she is
denying it, you have
the conflict of the two spouses?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And may also have other conflicting material?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And in the end, I suggest with respect what you do, is you have to make
a considered judgment evaluating everything as best you
can?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That is what district officers do when they have these sorts of cases
and they may well go to court if they need the help of
the court in helping
them to make the judgment."</i>
<P>

485	Professor Oates said that following the report of Ms Goldberg concerning
sexual abuse the departmental response concerning the
arranging of a case
conference for 21 May 1984 was <i>"the obvious and correct thing to do"</i>
(T1152).  Professor Oates agreed that Dr Waters was an appropriate person to
carry out the psychiatric assessment then decided upon.
<P>

486	I accept the opinions expressed by Professor Oates in the evidence I have
reviewed, noting the qualifications to his report
contained in his oral
evidence.
<P>

487	Dr Scott was called as an expert in the defendant's case.  Dr Scott is the
Senior Lecturer in and Deputy Head of the School
of Social Work at the
University of Melbourne.  Her doctorate involved researching the assessment of
cases of alleged sexual abuse
and I am satisfied that Dr Scott is highly
experienced in the field of child protection.  Her qualifications are fully
detailed in
her report, Exhibit 7, which was at the centre of her evidence.
For the most part and subject to the reservations which I will identify,
I
accept the evidence Dr Scott gave.  I reject the submission made by Mr Shand
that the evidence of this witness <i>"was coloured by a partisan desire to
provide excuses for the failures of departmental officers"</i>.
<P>

488	Dr Scott was asked to consider all the relevant exhibits in the case,
including those which indicated the responses by the various
officers of YACS
to the various notifications received concerning TC.
<P>

489	Dr Scott reported (at p 9 of Exhibit 7) that the Plater investigation in
October 1982 was satisfactory.  She then dealt with
the Finch investigation
following the presentation of the various affidavits in 1983 at pp 9-10:
<P>

	<i>"On January 28 1983 `HF' brought his son to the District Office and
requested that a District Officer examine the child for bruises
allegedly
inflicted by his mother, but upon checking, no bruises, marks or scratches were
found.  `HF' returned to the office a few
days later with a woman who had cared
for `TC' and who reported having seen the mother slap him on the face. The
mother was about
to be hospitalised for further treatment to her extensive
burns and `HF' requested that his son be placed in the Department's care.
 The
child protection worker contacted the women's refuge and they refuted claims
that the child had been ill treated, including
being tied to his cot when there
with his mother.  Such an allegation is a serious matter due to the risk such
restraint can pose
to the child but given that the alleged incident had
occurred approximately 9-10 months earlier, it would have been difficult to
ascertain the truth of such an allegation.  Whether it was reasonable to accept
the assurance of the refuge worker would depend in
part on the refuge's
credibility in the past in relation to their duty of care to children.  The
file records the Family Court Counsellor
indicating confidence in the refuge
staff and mentioning the name of a qualified social worker who supervised
`TC's' mother when
she was there.  The Family Court Counsellor, who was due to
see the parents very shortly, also challenged the right of the Department
to
intervene in the case.  He is described as having informed the child protection
worker of the agreement between the Family Court
and the Department to the
effect that the latter was to intervene only in dire circumstances and that it
was his view that the circumstances
in this case did not constitute
this.</i>
<P>

<i>	Given the lapse of time since the alleged incident, the mother's
hospitalisation at the time of the complaint, the refuge worker's
denial of the
incident, and the view expressed by the Family Court Counsellor who was
responsible for the case in relation to proceedings
occurring in the Family
Court at the time, the level of intervention by the Department in relation to
this allegation would appear
appropriate."</i>
<P>

490	Dr Scott said in her oral evidence that it would have been difficult to
assess the affidavit allegations in 1983 because of
the time lapse (T2016).  Dr
Scott agreed in cross examination that the allegation that the child had been
tied to the cot was a matter
of serious concern but she said that such an event
would not be as significant as the current assessment of the well being of the
child (T2019).  
<P>

491	I have earlier expressed my findings as to the sufficiency of the
investigations in early 1983 mindful of course of the evidence
of Dr Scott
which I have just been reviewing.  In this respect I do not accept what Dr
Scott wrote.
<P>

492	Dr Scott regarded the evidence as to the investigation of the scratches
issue in 1983 as being adequate and in summary, as I
understand the doctor's
report and evidence, she regarded the actions of YACS officers throughout the
remainder of the year 1983
as being reasonable in TC's case.  I find this to be
the case.
<P>

493	Dr Scott considered that the case conference and the recommendation for a
full psychiatric assessment afforded an appropriate
response to the emergence
of evidence of sexual abuse in May 1984.  I accept this evidence and I find
accordingly.
<P>

494	Dr Scott gave evidence which I accept that the long term effects of child
abuse, whilst they vary enormously, could be irreparable.
<P>

495	Dr Scott was then asked (at T1820):
<P>

	<i>"HIS HONOUR:  Q.  What would have been the damage to the child if the
alternative had been taken, taking the child away from the mother
as the
primary carer in an urgent way?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That's also hard to predict with any certainty, but the sudden removal
of a child from their primary figure of attachment, which
is usually the person
who is caring for the child on a day to day basis, is very strongly documented,
not only with short term separation
anxiety, but with long term consequences.
There is a very large body of research in child psychiatry that documents that,
that uses
both prospective studies looking at children subjected to repeated -
or even one-off hospitalisation at the ages of say two to four
when there were
hospital visiting practices which didn't allow the continuity of contact.
There is research that retrospectively
goes back from adults with psychiatric
disorders finding a very strong correlation with experiences of disrupted
attachments in early
childhood.  Much, much greater frequency than in adults
which don't have psychiatric disorders.  Then there is all of Harlow's work,
which was experimental work done on primates which would have been unethical on
humans, which actually inflicted such separation
and which has been
extrapolated.  So there is a thirty year body of research which documents the
high probability of long term emotional
damage to children who are removed from
their primary figure of attachment during something like between twelve months
and 5, but
I can't be definitive about that.  And that's always the dilemma in
child protection, is the weighing up of the probability of the
impact."</i>
<P>

496	Consistently with the answer above, Dr Scott was critical of the decision
of YACS to seek to have the residential assessment
of TC involving the child's
removal from his mother.  On this topic Dr Scott wrote in her report, Exhibit
7:
<P>

	<i>"The decision of the Department to seek through the Family Court the
custody of `TC' for a month so that he could be placed in a residential
setting
to allow `a full medical and emotional assessment of him to be made to
ascertain who, if anyone, is sexually abusing the
child', was inappropriate.
The Department argued that this assessment would be complementary with that
being undertaken by Dr Waters
at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children.  It
is hard to accept that such a proposed assessment could possibly be
`complementary
to the full family assessment'.  To the contrary, the removal of
`TC' from his mother at this age, would have very likely precipitated
some
level of separation anxiety which would have contaminated the psychiatric
assessment of his emotional adjustment, and posed
a risk of increasing his
insecurity.  Notes on the file suggest that this was the view of Dr Waters who
opposed the proposed temporary
placement.  It is my opinion that such a view
would be widely held among professionals in the child mental health field.  It
is also
unlikely that such a residential assessment would have achieved its
goal of evidence collection.  To remove a child for four weeks
in an attempt to
seek evidence of this nature, and in so doing so pose a risk of causing
emotional damage to the child, would be
a most unusual intervention."</i>
<P>

497	Dr Scott was, of course, correct in her understanding of the opinion of Dr
Waters.  Following his assessment, Dr Waters expressed
his opposition to the
removal of TC from his mother in his report of 1 November 1984 in which he
wrote in this respect:
<P>

	<i>"Removal of [TC] from his home to an assessment facility will do more harm
than good.  First, it will interrupt what is fairly satisfactory
mother-child
relationship and introduce further insecurity; second, it is most unlikely that
behaviour will be observed which will
confirm unequivocally the allegations of
sexual abuse; and third, even in this unlikely event, the identity of the
perpetrator will
not be able to be confirmed."</i>
<P>

498	Dr Scott was cross examined about the need by August 1984 for protective
measures to be urgently taken.  Dr Scott was asked
the following questions and
gave the following answers (at T1851):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  By that date, 14 August 1984, bearing in mind the information which
you are aware the department had in its possession, in particular
about sexual
abuse?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you regard the situation as one urgently requiring protective
measures to be taken for his welfare?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Protective measures in a thorough highly skilled assessment.
Protective measures in terms of removing the child from his mother's
care,
no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q. What does that amount to, does that mean that the mother would continue
to be alone with the child at night?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The need to have an assessment which interviews both parents and
observes the child with each was essential for the long term
case plan.  That
should have been done quickly.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you hear my question by any chance?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, and I don't think I can say anything more than say no, I don't
think I could support the proposition that the child should
be removed from his
mother's care without there being a full assessment of the child with both
parents.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Does that mean that in fact what you are saying is that it was
satisfactory from your point of view, bearing in mind the information
that you
have been taken to again about this child and the history, satisfactory to you
to have the child alone with the mother at
night, that was your meaning?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That is a risk balanced against the risk of removal.  There was a risk
involved in leaving the child in that situation and it
needs to be balanced
against the risks posed by removing him from that situation."</i>
<P>

499	Ultimately, as I understand their evidence, neither Professor Oates nor Dr
Scott expressed the opinion that YACS should have
removed TC from the care of
his mother at any stage before the department did ultimately intervene in
1986.
<P>

500	Neither expert opined that YACS should have taken such action before the
emergence of the sexual abuse factor in 1984.  It seems
to me, reflecting on
their evidence, that neither expert considered this would have been warranted
even if the tying to the cot episode
had been established to have taken place.
What was to be regarded as more important, certainly in Dr Scott's opinion, was
the current
assessment of TC's well being on an ongoing basis (see her evidence
at T2019).  Certainly the results of these ongoing assessments
did not lead Dr
Scott to conclude that YACS should have acted to remove TC from HM.
<P>

501	Even when the allegations concerning sexual abuse surfaced Dr Scott was
plainly opposed to the sudden removal of TC from his
mother, and it is clear
from her evidence that she considered the assessment by Dr Waters was the
appropriate response to the emergence
of the evidence as to sexual abuse.  Dr
Waters himself was of the like opinion.  This emerged in cross examination at
T2158-2159:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  I now ask you the same question as I asked you before.  Would you
agree that the combined effect of the conclusions reached by
Miss Parker and
Miss Ralston, and that which Miss Goldberg indicated, in particular at the end
of paragraph 6 of this affidavit,
provided strong grounds for the child no
longer being in the care and control of the mother?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well, even in isolation I wouldn't say it provides strong grounds.  I
think it provides grounds for concern, for an investigation
of some sort, but
not grounds for removal.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  At least it does this, does it not, it suggests a degree of
risk?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Let me come to Mr Malak.  I want to take you to his statement which is
relevant, which you have indicated you have.</i>
<P>

<i>	HIS HONOUR:  Q.  Doctor, going back to that last question that you
answered, those reports from Miss Parker and Miss Goldberg you
said afforded
grounds for investigation of some sort.  Was the investigation which you were
asked to undertake the appropriate investigation,
or are there other
investigations which you consider ought to have been carried out, based upon
that evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I would have thought that the investigation that I was asked to do
would be one way of tackling that issue.  I mean - yes."</i>
<P>

502	When his opinion became available to YACS it was clear that Dr Waters was
opposed to the removal of TC from HM, even for the
limited period that would
have been required for the contemplated assessment, and of course in due course
Ellis J refused the defendant's
application.
<P>

503	I accept the evidence of Dr Scott and Ms Boulter as to the rarity of the
sexual abuse of a small child by his mother and I bear
that in mind in
considering whether it was an appropriate response for YACS to have made to the
sexual allegations to have decided
to seek Dr Waters' assessment.  The evidence
that has been adduced satisfies me that that was an appropriate response.
<P>

504	I am persuaded by the evidence Dr Scott gave that it would have been
inappropriate to have removed TC from his mother before
Dr Waters made his
assessment, and because of the conclusions reached by Dr Waters I have decided
that it was appropriate thereafter
for YACS to act in the manner in which it
did.  Certainly as I assess the evidence I do not find it to have been proved
that there
was any breach of duty towards the plaintiff from the time Dr Waters
made his assessment and furnished his report in November 1984.
<P>

	<b><u>Delay in relation to Dr Waters</u></b>
<P>

505	There is however the question of the delay before Dr Waters was in a
position to make his assessment.
<P>

506	A considerable period of time elapsed between the first notification of the
allegation of sexual abuse that reached the department
in May 1984 and the date
upon which Dr Waters' report was received.  The time lapse was nearly six
months.
<P>

507	I have earlier traced the sequence of events between the receipt by YACS of
the relevant notification on 11 May 1984 and the
preparation and receipt of Dr
Waters' report on 1 November 1984 (see para 320 and following).  It seems to me
that there was delay
in engaging and instructing Dr Waters.
<P>

508	What had emerged in May 1984 was an allegation of a very serious nature,
and it was therefore an allegation which in the interests
of TC required urgent
attention.  Whilst I accept that the decision to seek Dr Waters' assessment was
the appropriate response, the
implementation of that decision warrants
criticism.  The sequence of events I reviewed earlier does not indicate that
the matter
did receive urgent attention.
<P>

509	I am mindful of the evidence of Dr Scott about this delay and I accept the
evidence that she gave.  Dr Scott regarded the delay
as unacceptable (T1818)
and so do I.  From the material with which Dr Scott had been provided, which of
course comprised all the
exhibits, Dr Scott could not account for the delay
(T1884).
<P>

510	Whilst it was Ms Harris, not an officer of YACS, who apparently undertook
to arrange for a prompt psychiatric assessment, Mr
Lungley was made case
coordinator.
<P>

511	It seems to me that it is YACS that must accept responsibility for the
failure to arrange for a prompt psychiatric assessment
and because of his role
in the matter Mr Lungley must be held responsible for this failure.
<P>

512	It does not appear that Dr Waters was appointed to undertake the assessment
until the conference on 9 July 1984, at which conference
it would seem, in the
absence of Mr Lungley through illness, no officer of YACS was present.  
<P>

513	Dr Waters wrote a letter to Mr Lungley on 16 July 1984 seeking any
documents that might assist him.  For some reason that letter
has a receipt
stamp in the Sydney office of YACS as late as 2 August 1984, but the relevant
material had been forwarded by Mr Lungley
the day before, so that it is
apparent that Mr Lungley appreciated the need to give Dr Waters material before
2 August.  The material
which Mr Lungley forwarded was a report which he wrote
on 31 July, and that was of a historical nature, and the reports from Mr Malak,
Ms Goldberg and Dr Rose.  He also forwarded a report of Ms Boulter of 17 June
1983.  With the exception of Mr Lungley's report of
31 July 1984, none of that
material was new, and the enclosures could have been made available to Dr
Waters as soon as he had been
appointed.
<P>

514	It emerged from the evidence Dr Waters gave that he received no letter of
instructions before undertaking his assessment.  Indeed,
he was not clear as to
the source of his instructions, as the following extract of his evidence
illustrates (T2140-2141):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  By whom did you perceive yourself to be retained in this
assessment?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  At the time I thought myself to be retained by the - actually by the
separate representative, and that's who I addressed the
report to.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  The representative of the child?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The child, yeah, Robert McCourt.  But in fact I think probably
technically I was by the department.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you get any letter of instruction outlining what you were being
asked to do, or any letter that sent you documents?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Well the short answer to that is I don't believe so.  I certainly got a
lot of documents, but I wrote - I sent out - as a result
of this July meeting I
sent out a number of letters under my own letterhead requesting documents.  I
think that that's where I got
most of them from."</i>
<P>

515	As late as 11 September 1984 Dr Waters wrote to Mr McCourt (see Exhibit
10G), apparently then considering that he had been retained
by Mr McCourt, and
explaining that he had only just received the documents he needed:
<P>

	<i>"Further to our meeting of July, I have only just received the majority of
the documentation which I desired prior to my seeing [TC]
and his parents.  For
your information, I have scheduled an appointment with [HM] and [TC] for 10.30
Thursday September 13th, and
an appointment with [HF] and [TC] for Thursday
September 20th at 10.30 a.m.  I anticipate that further appointments will be
necessary
to complete the assessment, however I will attempt to complete my
report in as short a time as possible."</i>
<P>

516	It is to be appreciated that once Dr Waters was equipped with the material
he needed he could not complete his assignment overnight,
including as it did
so many interviews.  Nevertheless, accepting that Dr Waters' engagement was
part of the YACS investigative process
arising from the notification in May
1984, it seems to me that Mr Lungley, in the discharge of his duty to exercise
reasonable care
in making a prompt investigation, should have taken the
following steps:
<P>

(a)	to engage Dr Waters promptly;
<P>

(b)	to give him clear written instructions as to what was being sought of
him;
<P>

(c)	to inquire of the doctor promptly what material he needed and to furnish
such material as soon as possible, so as to see to
it as best he could that the
assessment proceeded expeditiously.
<P>

517	I find that Mr Lungley failed in those three requirements and that this
amounted to a failure to exercise reasonable care in
the circumstances, which
was causative of such delay as there was up to 10 September 1984.
<P>

518	I can find no evidence that any attempt was ever made by Mr Lungley or
anyone else to interview Mrs Curran with a view to seeking
her account of her
relationship with HM or TC.  Perhaps she would have been unwilling to give any
such account, but had she been
willing her account about this relationship
would have been very relevant.  Be that as it may, the plaintiff has not raised
the failure
to interview or attempt to interview Mrs Curran as a particular of
negligence, and the issue has not been addressed in submissions.
 Accordingly
it would be inappropriate for me to make any finding on this subject.
<P>

	<b><u>The negligence alleged against the various officers of YACS</u></b>
<P>

519	So far in the course of this judgment I have considered in large part the
case of negligence which the plaintiff has presented,
but for completion I
propose to address the plaintiff's submissions concerning the negligence
alleged against each of the officers
involved.  
<P>

	<b>Mr Plater</b>
<P>

520	I considered earlier at para 215 and following criticisms levelled at Mr
Plater.  Having regard to the findings I there expressed,
I do not consider
that there was any failure by Mr Plater to exercise reasonable care in his
attention to TC's case.
<P>

	<b>Mr Hulbert</b>
<P>

521	The criticisms of Mr Hulbert's limited involvement I considered earlier at
para 221 and following, and once again I am not satisfied
that Mr Hulbert
failed to exercise reasonable care in his attention to TC's case.
<P>

	<b>Mr Finch</b>
<P>

522	Much of the criticism directed at Mr Finch I considered earlier when
looking at his involvement between paragraphs 228 and 265.
 I have already
expressed findings as to the shortcomings in the investigations undertaken by
YACS into the allegations made in the
affidavits and the statement presented in
February and March 1983.  I am not satisfied otherwise that in any of the
respects advanced,
Mr Finch failed to exercise reasonable care in his attention
to TC's case.
<P>

523	It is submitted that Mr Finch was negligent in failing to bring the matter
to the Children's Court in the latter half of 1984.
 That issue as to whether
proceedings ought to have been taken in the Children's Court I have considered
elsewhere.  It follows from
the conclusions I reached concerning that matter
that this head of negligence against Mr Finch has not been established.
<P>

	<b>Mrs Burgess</b>
<P>

524	I have earlier considered the role of Mrs Burgess in relation to the
investigation into the allegations made in the material
presented in February
and March 1983. I do not otherwise find that Mrs Burgess failed to exercise
reasonable care in her approach
to TC's case.
<P>

525	As in the case of Mr Finch, it is alleged against Mrs Burgess that she was
negligent in failing to take steps to remove TC from
HM's care.  It follows
from what I have written earlier, particularly when considering the expert
evidence of Prof Oates, Dr Scott
and Dr Waters, that I do not regard this
allegation against Mrs Burgess to have been made good.
<P>

	<b>Mr Hanrahan</b>
<P>

526	I have earlier reviewed at length Mr Hanrahan's involvement in this matter,
and the measures that he took on and after 25 February
1983.  Earlier I have
attributed fault for the shortcomings in the investigation by the Department at
about that time, but since
I do not find that Mr Hanrahan saw the affidavits by
Mrs Denley, Ms Daskalopoulos, Ms Papakonstantinou and Ms Brunner at a time
relevant
to his involvement, and since I do not find that he saw either the
statement or the subsequent affidavit by Ms Tokatlidis then, I
am not satisfied
that this officer was negligent.  Indeed I am satisfied that throughout his
involvement in the matter Mr Hanrahan
did exercise reasonable care in
addressing TC's case.
<P>

	<b>Mr Langshaw</b>
<P>

527	I considered earlier the significance of the receipt by Mr Langshaw of the
letter from Mrs Foot of 1 March 1983 (Exhibit A(adb)).
 Mr Langshaw was not
called to explain his endorsement on that document, so I am unable to determine
what prompted him to record
that the <i>"papers"</i> Mrs Foot had forwarded
contained no <i>"fresh"</i> material.  That endorsement was incorrect, and I
expressed my conclusion earlier that the failure to interview Mrs Tokatlidis
and
Mrs Brunner and then to interview HM to put to her the Tokatlidis and
Brunner assertions constituted a failure to exercise reasonable
care.
<P>

528	Mr Langshaw was entitled to rely upon Mrs Burgess and any responsible
officer she assigned to the task to make relevant inquiries,
and equally he was
entitled to rely upon information passed on to him by a responsible officer as
to the outcome of inquiries.
<P>

529	As the evidence was left, I am unable to determine the individual
responsibility for the failure to properly address the Tokatlidis
and Brunner
material, but failure there was, and the failure was the failure of YACS, and
constituted a lack of reasonable care.
<P>

530	It is submitted also against Mr Langshaw that he should have directed that
steps be taken for TC to be removed from HM's care.
 I have elsewhere assessed
the evidence of Dr Scott, Professor Oates and Dr Waters, and expressed my
findings on that evidence. 
It follows from what I have written in that regard
that this submission fails.
<P>

	<b>Mr Lungley</b>
<P>

531	I have earlier expressed a finding as to the response of this officer in
the investigation of the notification in May 1984 and
for the shortcomings I
have identified (in para 516).  I do not otherwise find Mr Lungley to have been
negligent.
<P>

	<b>Mr Callaghan</b>
<P>

532	In Mr Callaghan's case also it is submitted that he was negligent in not
initiating action to remove TC from HM's care.  It
is submitted that he should
have so acted immediately after his interview with HF in August 1984.  Once
again, having regard to the
evidence of Professor Oates and Dr Scott and to the
conclusions I expressed earlier following consideration of their evidence, I
reject this submission.
<P>

533	It is further submitted that Mr Callaghan should have obtained an
alternative expert opinion to support that of Dr Waters. 
I find no substance
in that submission.  Dr Waters was selected to make the assessment because of
his recognised expertise and in
my opinion the exercise of reasonable care on
Mr Callaghan's part did not require that he should have arranged for the
qualification
of a second psychiatrist.
<P>

534	It is also alleged against Mr Callaghan that he was negligent in not
proceeding in the Children's Court.  The criticisms directed
at the failure to
proceed in the Children's Court have been considered elsewhere.  Having regard
to what I have already written on
that issue, I reject the submission that Mr
Callaghan was negligent in failing to have proceedings taken in the Children's
Court.
<P>

	<b>Ms Boulter</b>
<P>

535	The first allegation against Ms Boulter is that she was negligent in
February 1983 in failing herself to consider the various
affidavits produced by
HF.  Ms Boulter's involvement in this case began in May 1983.  Her evidence as
to when it was that she first
saw those affidavits and the Tokatlidis statement
was vague and hence unsatisfactory.  However, since she was not assigned to
investigate
such material, in the circumstances I am not satisfied she shares
responsibility for the shortcomings of such investigation as there
was in that
regard.
<P>

536	I have considered earlier the investigation into the various complaints of
scratches.  In my opinion Ms Boulter did exercise
reasonable care in her
participation in inquiries as to those complaints.  I earlier addressed the
specific allegation of negligence
by Ms Boulter in not advising Mr Hampson to
assess TC and in failing to recognise the seriousness of the allegation of
sexual abuse
that surfaced in relation to the notification on 11 May 1984.  For
the reasons expressed earlier, I do not consider that there was
any failure to
exercise reasonable care on Ms Boulter's part at that time and I am not
satisfied that Ms Boulter failed to exercise
reasonable care elsewhere in
attending to TC's case.
<P>

	<b>Mr Heagney and Mr Croke</b>
<P>

537	I have already considered their involvement in this case and the
considerations affecting the choice of court in 1984.  In doing
so I expressed
my finding that I was not persuaded that these legal officers acted
negligently.  
<P>

	<b>Ms Ralston and Ms Withers</b>
<P>

538	It is alleged against these officers that they were negligent in failing to
take TC's case to the Children's Court in 1984.
 Neither of these officers, of
course, had the ultimate responsibility for the decision that was reached to
proceed in the Family
Court, but since I do not regard the decision to proceed
in the Family Court as being a decision reached in the absence of reasonable
care, I do not find those involved in the decision making process as having
been negligent.
<P>

539	It is also submitted that these officers were negligent in altering
conclusions from their earlier report for the purposes of
the affidavit
evidence in the Family Law Court.  Reference is made in support of this
submission to Exhibit A(abj), (abt), (abu)
and (acc).  
<P>

540	Exhibit A(abj) is a very lengthy document extending into a fourteenth page
and it records, in the form of a joint report, steps
taken by the two officers
on 21 and 22 August 1984, including attendances and interviews at TC's
pre-school and attendance and interview
with HM on the following day.  The
document records concerns that the authors had and concludes with an expression
of opinion:
<P>

	<i>"It is the psychologist's assessment that [TC] is an emotionally deprived
little boy who has been sexually abused and has been exposed
to adult sexual
behaviour."</i>
<P>

541	Each of the authors of the joint report swore an affidavit for the purposes
of the department's application for leave to intervene
in the Family Court
proceedings and for the purposes of those several affidavits, each deponent
prepared her own individual report
for annexure.
<P>

542	Exhibit A(acc) is a handwritten document by Ms Boulter and it purports to
record a case discussion on 4 September 1984 which
was attended by Mr Finch,
Mrs Burgess, Ms Withers, Ms Ralston and Ms Boulter.  This exhibit records that
there was discussion which
centred around the earlier joint report and it was
agreed that the report was not in suitable form for evidence in court, and that
a more precise report would be necessary.  The exhibit records that opinion was
expressed that the report may clash with earlier
statements on file in reports
of Ms Boulter and Mr Lungley.
<P>

543	Neither Ms Withers nor Ms Ralston was called in this case but Ms Boulter
was cross examined about Exhibit A(acc) (T2416).  She
refuted the inference
that might otherwise have arisen that a decision was taken at the case
discussion on 4 September to change
the form of the joint report so that these
two witnesses could express opinions in agreement with what had been written
earlier by
the other officers.
<P>

544	I am not persuaded that there was any sinister motive for the preparation
of the two subsequent reports.  It was proper that
what each officer placed
before the court be written in a more concise form and it was proper that each
officer should express her
own opinion.  The earlier joint report stated the
psychologist's assessment about TC in conclusion but it did not state the
protection
worker's opinion.  In the later documents placed before the court,
each officer stated her own opinion.  I am certainly not persuaded
that the
authors changed the form of the report in order to avoid expressing views
contrary to those earlier expressed by Ms Boulter
and Mr Lungley.  Nor am I
persuaded that the later individual reports evidence a failure of either
officer to exercise reasonable
care in TC's case.
<P>

	<b>The Department</b>
<P>

545	It is submitted against the department generally that there was a failure
to exercise reasonable care in not taking immediate
steps to bring TC before
the Children's Court in August 1984 and subsequently.  I am satisfied on the
evidence I reviewed earlier
that the Department acted on the advice of its
legal advisers in deciding not to take proceedings in the Children's Court.
The findings
earlier expressed at paragraph 382 address the submission
presently under consideration and this submission fails.  
<P>

	<b><u>Conclusions</u></b>
<P>

546	I have given close consideration to all the evidence and the submissions in
this case.  I find that there was a failure by YACS
to exercise reasonable care
in the respects earlier identified:
<P>

(i)	the incomplete investigation of the material presented in February and
March 1983;
<P>

(ii)	the delay associated with the engagement of Dr Waters to make his
assessments in 1984.
<P>

547	I am not satisfied that any other alleged breach of duty has been
proved.
<P>

548	Section 158 of the <i>Child Welfare Act</i> does not afford a defence
unless <i>"the Minister or the officer or employee has acted in good faith
</i><cite>and</cite><i> with reasonable care."</i>  It follows from my finding
of the failure to exercise reasonable care in the above respects that the
section does not afford a defence
in respect of those breaches of duty I have
identified.
<P>

549	In order to establish his cause of action against the defendant, the
plaintiff is required to prove not only breach of duty
by the defendant, which
he has done in the respects I have identified, but he must also prove that
breach of duty as established
caused the plaintiff harm.
<P>

550	Whether the breaches of duty that I have found were causative of harm,
either individually or collectively, remains to be determined,
but it does not
seem to me that I should address this issue without affording to the parties a
further opportunity to be heard, for
reasons which I now express. 
<P>

551	Whilst in submissions in reply counsel for the plaintiff have sought to
advance the proposition that proper investigation would
have satisfied YACS by
August 1993 at the latest that TC was at risk of abuse from HM and that the
risk was ongoing, it is clear
that that submission is not directed only to the
findings of breach of duty which I have expressed in this judgment.  Nor have
counsel
for the defendant addressed the issue of causation which now requires
to be considered in the light of the findings which I have
made.  Moreover, the
terms of the order for a separate trial on the issue of liability contemplated
that <i>"the question of causation of any loss or damage to the plaintiff by
an...act or default be tried together with the issue of damages."</i>  It seems
to me whilst that order stands I should not yet address the question as to
whether the breaches of duty I have found, or
either of them, caused loss or
damage to the plaintiff.  In the orders I am about to make I intend to afford
the parties the opportunity
of advancing submissions as to how and when this
issue of causation I have just identified can most efficiently be addressed.
<P>

	<b><u>Findings and formal orders</u></b>
<P>

552	1.	I find that the first defendant was in breach of its duty of care owed
to the plaintiff:
<P>

(a)	In the failure following the presentation in February and March 1983 of the
material identified in para 234 of this judgment
to take the steps identified
in paras 247 and 248 of this judgment;
<P>

(b)	In the failure following receipt of the notification in May 1984 to attend
promptly to the matters addressed in para 516 of
this judgment.
<P>

2.	I order that the cause be listed for directions as to its further conduct on
Thursday 25 February 1999.
<P>

3.	Costs in respect of the proceedings against the first defendant thus far are
reserved.
<P>

4.	There is to be judgment for the third defendant as to the claim against
her.
<P>

5.	I make no order as to the costs of the claim against the third defendant.
<P>
