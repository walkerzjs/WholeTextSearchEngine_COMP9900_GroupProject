<center><b>VAN TRI HUNYH v. JAMES LAWRENCE SWANSON &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1  	In this matter I delivered judgment on 17 February 1999 in
proceedings seeking a declaration which came on for hearing on 7
December 1998.
It was sought that it be declared that the first-named defendant, a magistrate,
at the hearing determine according
to law an action brought in that court by
the plaintiff against the second defendant.  Orders were also sought quashing a
decision
of the magistrate that he did not have jurisdiction to determine the
claim as it was brought.
<P>

2  	Before me the proceedings involved the agitation of a number of
questions, principally, firstly, whether in the Local Court
under the Local
Courts Act the magistrate had jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for
contribution by reason of  implication of
law in respect of certain guarantees
and further, whether it was inevitable that to those proceedings an answer
based on an <b>Anschun</b> estoppel would inevitably be made out.
<P>

3  	In respect of both of those matters, the plaintiff was
successful.  I concluded that the magistrate had wrongly declined jurisdiction
and that the estoppel would not necessarily be made out, so that there was
point in remitting the matter to the magistrate.
<P>

4  	Before me it has been contended on behalf of the plaintiff that
the arguments made by the respondent should at all times have
been recognized
as entirely untenable (notwithstanding that the magistrate not only entertained
them but upheld them) such that it
is appropriate that indemnity costs be
awarded on the basis of the principle laid down in<b> Fountain Selected Meats
(Sales) Pty. Limited v. International Produce Merchants Pty. Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/202.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 202</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2081%20ALR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988)
81 ALR 397.</a>  In essence, it is submitted that at all times the respondent had
successfully persuaded the magistrate of a hopeless case and persisted
in that
hopeless case in this court.  It is put that the litigation here was
unnecessary and proceeded with wilful disregard of clearly
established law.
<P>

5  	As I have said in my judgment of 17 February, the points raised
in the litigation as far as the jurisdiction of the Local Court
was concerned,
were most interesting and important questions for the jurisdiction of that
court as to the ambit of matters which
may be pleaded using a common money
count and the entitlement to and provenance of the modern right to contribution
(paragraph 24).

<P>

6  	The issue before me involved the determination of the true
meaning of what had been expressed in a number of judgments, including
judgments in this court and in the High Court.  The <b>Anschun</b> question
involved the determination of the precise issues litigated between the parties
in the Local Court amid a mass of litigation
conducted by the parties in that
and other courts.
<P>

7  	I consider that this is not a matter in which it is appropriate
to embark upon a dissection of the issues that were before this
court and the
magistrate such as to seek to examine any particular issue in isolation from
the others.  I do consider that what was
raised and determined in the
proceedings before me was not baseless or in wilful disregard of existing law
or such that the respondent
should have been disentitled from having a proper
and authoritative legal determination of the legal matters raised.
<P>

8  	In those circumstances, I am not of the view that this is an
appropriate case in which to make an order for indemnity costs.
<P>

9  	It nonetheless follows from the result and nothing has been put
to the contrary by Mr. Brereton, SC. appearing for the respondent,
that the
respondent should pay the plaintiff's costs.  It is however an appropriate
matter, as far as I can ascertain, for the award
of a certificate under s.6 of
the<b> </b>Suitor's Fund Act and I make the order that the respondent should
have such a certificate.
<P>

(Further submissions from counsel)
<P>

10  	The matter having come before me for the pronouncement of final
orders and to dispose of questions of costs, I have decided
against the
plaintiff on the plaintiff's application for indemnity costs.  That decision
was substantially on the basis that I was
not of the view that the respondent's
arguments in the principal proceedings were baseless or in wilful disregard of
authority.
<P>

11  	At the conclusion of those proceedings and once the form of
orders to be pronounced otherwise had been debated, Mr. Brereton
for the
respondent, sought that the plaintiff should be denied his costs of the
proceedings today on the basis presumably that his
application for indemnity
costs was unreasonable in the light of the correspondence between the
solicitors that has been tendered
and was unlikely, at the least, to succeed,
so unlikely indeed, that it too should be regarded as baseless.
<P>

12  	In my view, that application should meet the same fate as the
plaintiff's earlier application met.  I do not regard the application
for costs
on an indemnity basis as unreasonable in the circumstances or baseless.  The
plaintiff should have his costs of the proceedings
in this court, including the
costs of today, particularly since the argument about costs has extended the
proceedings, if at all,
by only about half an hour.
<P>

13  	I make orders in accordance with the short minutes as amended by
me, initialled and placed with the papers.
<P>
