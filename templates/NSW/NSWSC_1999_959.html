Friday 24 September 1999
<P>

<b>3269/98	NEARHAZE PTY LTD &amp; ANOR v THE OFFICIAL TRUSTEE - BANKRUPT ESTATE
OF MICHAEL FRANCIS BYRNE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiffs are two companies which are wholly
under the control of Mr George Couri, a property developer who
has many
business interests.  The plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to security
under an unregistered equitable mortgage over
the land in Folio Identifier
1/797924, the house at 20 Adolphus Street, East Balmain.  The mortgagee named
in the mortgage is Nearhaze
the first plaintiff, and Lasovase the second
plaintiff is not named in it.  Mr Michael Francis Byrne and Mrs Catherine Mary
Byrne
were the registered proprietors as joint tenants of the house in 1996
when the form of mortgage was executed. On 21 October 1998,
while these
proceedings were pending the house was sold by ANZ Banking Group Ltd, which
held a registered first mortgage, to purchasers
unrelated to these parties for
$770,000.  After satisfying all its own claims ANZ held a surplus of
$201,005.82, and paid that amount
into court in proceedings 4813 of 1998 to
avoid becoming involved in any dispute.  The funds remain in court and the
claims of the
plaintiffs have become claims against that fund.
<P>

2  	Mr Byrne formerly the first defendant became bankrupt by a
Sequestration Order of the Federal Court of Australia on 15 March
1999; then
the Official Trustee of his estate became first defendant in his stead.
Lasovase Pty Ltd was added as second plaintiff
by an amendment made on 25 June
1999.  The third defendant was Obelisque Securities Pty Ltd and the fourth
defendant is Politi Pty
Ltd; these defendants claimed security interests under
other mortgages.  While the proceedings were pending the claim of Obelisque
Securities were satisfied out of some collateral security, and the plaintiffs
discontinued against it.  During the hearing before
me an agreement was reached
between the plaintiffs, Mrs Byrne and Politi which compromised Politi's claim
on terms which included
payment of $45,000 to Politi out of funds in court.
Politi had security which in time of advance and time of mortgage ranked later
in priority than the plaintiff's mortgage; if Politi had defeated the
plaintiffs' claim it would have had first claim on the fund.
 Politi's claim
was disputed only in the respect that the plaintiffs claim priority over it;
complete success for the plaintiffs
would have depleted the fund.
<P>

3  	To have access to the funds in Court the plaintiffs must
establish that they had an equitable interest over the house against
the
registered proprietors.  The plaintiffs could not get access to the funds in
court if they established only that Mr Byrne or
Mrs Byrne incurred personal
liability for payment of a debt.  No personal liability can be enforced against
Mr Byrne except in the
administration of his estate under Bankruptcy law. The
Amended Statement of Claim did not allege that Mrs Byrne was a borrower. 
 In
my opinion there is no evidence of substance against Mrs Byrne which could
establish that she was herself a borrower of funds
from either of the
plaintiffs and incurred personal liability. There  are no more than shreds of
material in evidence which could
suggest that she incurred personal liability
and these take forms which could not reasonably be the basis of a finding
against her.
 One is that in an incidental reference in an affidavit Mr Byrne
referred to the debts as "our borrowings" in a context which included
Mrs
Byrne.  The other is that in ambiguous references in Mr Byrne's letter of 21
September 1996 he could be understood to have indicated
that Mrs Byrne was or
would be liable; however these references are equivocal and could allude to her
contemplated liability under
a future mortgage.  Except for the shreds I have
mentioned the evidence uniformly speaks of Mr Byrne as the borrower.  There is
no
substantial evidence that Mrs Byrne or anyone on her behalf entered into an
agreement to borrow money or actually received any money.
 The only manner in
which she could be held liable  is that property of which she was a joint owner
may be charged under an equitable
mortgage.  So far as appears she was a
volunteer in the dealings with Nearhaze; there is no evidence that she
requested that advances
be made to Mr Byrne or to another person or that she
otherwise received consideration for the advances or had any interest in them.

<P>

4  	The form of mortgage is very defective.  It states that the
mortgagee is Nearhaze: it does not mention Lasovase.  It was made
on a <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a></b> short form and signed by Mr and Mrs Byrne before a witness
late in 1996.  Vital parts of the form were left blank.  It does not identify
the debt which it secures, or contain any "all moneys" clause.  Indeed it does
not say that it secures any debt, or refer to any
debt.  Its printed terms
provide for incorporation in it of provisions from another document, but there
is no annexed document and
no text which would identify any incorporated
document.  It is not possible to know what the mortgage secures from what it
says,
and it would not have prevailed in a competition of priorities with
another unregistered mortgage, because it does not contain a
provision
identifying what is charged, which it is essential that a mortgage should have.

<P>

5  	If an equitable mortgage is to be an enforceable charge against
property and if it is to create rights higher than rights in
personam it must
comply with the formal requirements for writing in s.23C and s.54A of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a></b>, and to do so a memorandum of a mortgage must
contain all essential terms; the essential terms include identification of the
loan
or obligation which is secured.  This view is based on the nature of a
mortgage itself; there can be no mortgage without a debt charged.
 For this
reason the form of mortgage was not, in my opinion, ever an enforceable
charge.
<P>

6  	If there had been an accidental omission there would be a need
for rectification proceedings to supply the omission, and in
my opinion a
mortgage which does not comply with statutory requirements for writing and
would only do so if assisted by rectification
claim is no more than a mere
equity and cannot prevail in a competition of priorities against a
well-constituted mortgage later in
date.  The fact that Mrs Byrne is a
volunteer means that there is no equity to obtain rectification.  However there
are no competing
priorities and I am to consider only whether the mortgage
created an effective security as between the parties to it.  
<P>

7  	The form of mortgage is not the only possible document which
could have created an equitable mortgage.  When the document is
taken together
with Mr Byrne's letter of 21 December 1996 there is a sufficient memorandum of
an agreement by Mr Byrne that there
would be a mortgage, that it would secure
$285,000 and that it would be a mortgage for the benefit of Lasovase.  Case law
relating
to taking two documents together for the purpose of the statutory
requirement for a memorandum was reviewed by Hill J in <b>ANZ Banking Group v
Widin</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1990/474.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] FCA 474</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2026%20FCR%2021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 26 FCR 21</a> at 28 and following.  In this approach the
memorandum is the letter of 21 December.  The letter cannot be seen as
incorporated by
reference in the mortgage so as to bind Mrs Byrne, but the
mortgage was incorporated by reference in the letter, so as to bind Mr
Byrne
and him only.
<P>

8  	The course of dealing prior to the execution of the form of
mortgage and the letter of 21 December 1996 show that notwithstanding
its
defects Mr Byrne and Mr Couri intended that the form of mortgage should secure
whatever money Mr Byrne owed.  When the mortgage
was delivered to Mr Couri
there were debts due from Mr Byrne to Nearhaze, and there had been discussions,
not any concrete arrangement
established by the evidence, about granting a
mortgage to secure them.  The mortgage actually granted does not accord exactly
with
the proposal discussed, but as a matter of probability it was intended at
the time it was delivered that it should secure debts then
owed by Mr Byrne to
Nearhaze.  There is an issue of fact about when it was delivered:  Mr Couri's
evidence is that the document was
delivered  to him late in December 1996 after
Christmas, and Mr Byrne says in evidence that it was delivered earlier, in
September
or it may be October 1996.  
<P>

9  	This issue was largely to be resolved on the conflicting
testimony of these two persons.  Both were cross-examined and I had
the
opportunity to observe them.  Neither of them exhibited any demeanour which I
regard as significantly assisting me in deciding
whether their evidence should
be acted on; I observed nothing adverse to reliance on either witness in their
demeanour and nothing
which led me to have any confidence in either.  Both
behaved with astonishing inattention in serious business matters and failed
to
act with ordinary adult responsibility and prudence while handling business
which related to significant sums of money.  Neither
made documents
contemporaneous with the transactions which are intelligible or clear enough to
establish their rights in transactions
with large sums.  When there are
references to their transactions in correspondence or financial statements they
are very difficult
to understand.  Cross-examination showed some difficulties
of recollection and anomalies in Mr Byrne's evidence, not in any respect
which
I regard as clearly indicating that he was not reliable.  I do not see any
means of testing their evidence on any significant
point of difference against
what I could regard as objectively incontrovertible sources.  I take a cautious
approach to finding facts
on the evidence of either of them.  Where they are in
conflict I am therefore left to act largely on my view about where the
probabilities
lie, and to act with less than complete certainty.
<P>

10  	Acceptance of Mr Couri's case is rendered more difficult by the
circumstance that the claims relate to large sums of money
and a security
interest which ordinary prudence as well as the law shows should be carefully
recorded in writing; the fact that there
were no documents contemporaneous with
and creating a clear record of the transactions is a difficulty for accepting
the account
of the transactions he now gives.  In common prudence a lender
taking security would obtain a written record acknowledged by the
signature of
every person granting security, identifying the lender and clearly establishing
the security and the amount.  The plaintiffs
are in a very poor position when
asking for findings on the probabilities and basing themselves on strangely
expressed letters and
schedules of figures prepared by Mr Byrne which are
equivocal in various ways and can only be understood if given highly
sympathetic
readings.
<P>

11  	In my understanding it is not of great importance exactly when
the mortgage document was handed over.  However the probabilities
appear to me
to favour its having been handed over when Mr Couri says it was, late in
December.  At that time Mr Byrne was indebted
to one or both of the plaintiffs
for a number of different advances.  Neither Mr Byrne nor Mr Couri could give a
clear account of
the loan transactions which led to the debt position as it was
as of 30 December 1996.  The best material available is a statement
prepared by
Mr Byrne at some time in 1997.  Rough notes in two different forms on two
different copies of Mr Byrne's letter to Mr
Couri of 20 September 1996
supplemented by Mr Byrne's evidence show that late in December Mr Byrne was
indebted to Nearhaze for (at
least) $53,560 and that he had several different
debts to Lasovase. I cannot confidently state the total but significant debts
arose
out of an advance of exactly or approximately $176,000 made on or about 4
November 1996, and somewhat reduced thereafter by repayment.
 By this time
advancing money to Mr Byrne was Nearhaze's only business, and the advances were
made out of its bank account, which
was overdrawn $55,517.65 on 30 December
1996.  There were also some significant debts then due to Lasovase.  
<P>

12  	On 30 December 1996 Lasovase borrowed $285,000 on a Commercial
Bill from ANZ Banking Group.  This was applied in a number of
ways for the
benefit of Mr Byrne.  Part of it was applied to repay Nearhaze's overdraft, and
I see this as having repaid Mr Byrne's
debts to Nearhaze.  The transaction must
be understood as a loan by Lasovase to Mr Byrne of $285,000, part of which was
used to pay
his debt to Nearhaze.  The transaction is referred to in a message
from Mr Byrne to Mr Couri of 21 December 1996 headed "Second Unregistered
Mortgage.  20 Adolphus Street, Balmain" with which he forwarded a repayment
schedule.  Mr Couri produced in evidence, belatedly,
what he says is a copy of
the repayment schedule and Mr Byrne has produced from his computer record what
he says is an updated version
(meaning a later version).  Internal references
appear to confirm that the version produced by Mr Couri could well have been
prepared
before 30 December 1996 while the version produced by Mr Byrne was
made somewhat later.  A great deal of the repayment schedule cannot
be followed
but it appears to confirm that of the advance of $285,000, $55,517.65 was used
to repay Nearhaze's overdraft.  (A corresponding
credit appears in Nearhaze's
bank statement).  How the rest was applied is not clear; it seems that some or
all was applied to pay
out various debts which were then owing by Mr Byrne to
Lasovase; in Mr Byrne's expression, to refinance them.  I find that Mr Byrne's
liability for principal debt was $285,000 when the transactions of 30 December
1996 closed, and it was a liability to Lasovase.
<P>

13  	Although those transactions paid out the debt then owed to
Nearhaze, it is not clear that it was the intention of Mr Byrne
or of Mr Couri
that those events should bring the operation of the form of mortgage to an end.
The heading of Mr Byrne's message
of 21 December 1996 appears to indicate that
it was contemplated that the second unregistered mortgage was to be the
continuing subject
of their dealings.  
<P>

14  	The same letter ends "This letter is an acknowledgment that the
mortgage as at 30 December 1996 will have a liability of $285,000."
 
<P>

15  	The difficulty of accepting this statement, and attributing to
it effect as against Mrs Byrne, is that the creditor after the
events of 30
December 1996 was Lasovase Pty Ltd, which borrowed the money on the Commercial
Bill and must be treated as having made
the advance to Mr Byrne on that day.
To the extent to which the advance was applied to pay off a debt secured by the
form of mortgage
to Nearhaze, the only mortgagee named in the mortgage, I am of
opinion that Lasovase would be entitled to the benefit of security
under the
doctrine of subrogation stated thus by the Privy Council in <b>Ghana Commercial
Bank v Chandiram</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20AC%20732" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] AC 732</a> at 745: <i>"It is not open to doubt that
where a third party pays off a mortgage he is presumed, unless the contrary
appears, to intend that
the mortgage shall be kept alive for his own benefit:
see Butler v Rice  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1910%5d%202%20Ch%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1910] 2 Ch. 277</a>, 282, 283."</i>  See too <b>Cochrane v
Cochrane</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 403</a> at 405 (Kearney J).  Further authorities are
given in Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage, Australian Edition 1995, Tyler
Young
and Cross at para[14.6].  Nothing in evidence indicates a contrary
intention.  
<P>

16  	The result is that notwithstanding that Nearhaze was paid all
its debt on 30 December 1996, the mortgage, if it had effect
as an equitable
mortgage, would continue to have effect as an equitable mortgage for the
benefit of Lasovase to the extent of the
debt due to Nearhaze which had been
paid out of Lasovase's advance.  The last sentence of Mr Byrne's letter of 21
December 1996 which
I have quoted shows that it was his intention then that
Lasovase should have the advantage of a mortgage for $285,000.  If this took
effect there would be no room for subrogation to have any effect; it would give
security for $55,517.65 which was part of the same
$285,000.
<P>

17  	Mr Byrne's intention expressed in his letter of 21 December
1996, which I attribute also to Mr Couri, could not have the effect
of
conferring on Lasovase a security interest as against Mrs Byrne and her
interest in the house.  The form of mortgage was, as its
own terms plainly
show, a mortgage granted to Nearhaze and to no one else.  After the
transactions of 30 December 1996 Nearhaze had
no security interest over the
property under the form of mortgage.  Only by subrogation could any other
creditor come to have the
benefit of the security which it granted.  Even if
Nearhaze had a right to increase the debt which it secured (which would depend
on some agreement to which Mrs Byrne was a party, and there is no evidence of
one) it could not pass that advantage on and enable
someone else to confer on
itself an increased charge over Mrs Byrne's interest.  There was nothing in the
nature of an assignment
of the mortgage. 
<P>

18  	Mrs Byrne, and also Mr Byrne whose interests have now passed to
the Official Trustee, alleged in their Defences that in May
1997 the mortgage
was discharged, the discharge took the form that Mr Byrne asked that the
document be given to him by Mr Couri as
the Nearhaze loan had been repaid; Mr
Couri gave it to him and Mr Byrne tore it up.  These events followed events in
which, as Mr
Byrne asserts, he arranged with Mr Couri that Mr Couri should have
security for the amount outstanding to his companies in the form
of a bank
guarantee of $200,000, but Mr Byrne then could not obtain a bank guarantee for
more than $100,000; he did that, and Lasovase
had the benefit of that
guarantee.  (At a later time the bank in fact paid $100,000 under this
guarantee to Lasovase and recouped
itself out of the proceeds of sale of the
house under the first mortgage.  This has effected a $100,000 reduction in
Lasovase's claims
arising out of the advance of $285,000, a $100,000 increase
in the amount recovered by the Bank under the first mortgage, and a $100,000
reduction in the amount paid into court.
<P>

19  	Mr Couri gives an entirely different account; he placed the form
of mortgage in his files, he is disorderly in keeping files
and after searches
he cannot now find the form of mortgage, and all that he is able to produce is
a photocopy apparently made at
fairly early stage by his accountant Mr Beath
and kept in Mr Beath's file.  It was put forward in the plaintiffs' case that
Mr Byrne
had access to Mr Couri's office and had an opportunity to remove the
mortgage document without Mr Couri's authority.  I do not regard
the evidence
as showing on the balance of probabilities that Mr Byrne removed the mortgage
without authority.  In so finding I have
regard to the serious nature of the
suggestion that Mr Byrne stole the document and destroyed it without authority.
There is an unreconcilable
conflict between the evidence of Mr Byrne about the
document's being delivered to him under an arrangement to discharge it and then
destroyed and Mr Couri's evidence that there were no such arrangement and
delivery. 
<P>

20  	On the one hand the plaintiffs submitted to the effect that the
onus of proof that an equitable mortgage was discharged rests
on the
defendants; on the other hand it was submitted for the second defendant that
the plaintiffs bear the onus of proving not only
that an equitable mortgage was
created but that in all the circumstances it still exists and should be
enforced as of the time of
the hearing.  It is well established that the burden
of proof of payment lies on the debtor: see <b>Young v Queensland Trustees
Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20560" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 560</a>, and it would follow in principle that the burden of
proving that the debt has been discharged in any other way than by payment also
rests on the debtor, and yet further that the burden of proof that the security
conferred by an equitable mortgage has been discharged
also lies on the
mortgagor.  I feel some disquiet about whether this approach is appropriate
where the equitable mortgage was created
as one step in a continuing series of
informal transactions and was not created in a clear and regular way; a rule of
law which imposed
on the plaintiffs the burden of showing that upon the whole
series of transactions they were at the time of hearing entitled to security
would be supportable but I know of no authority for such a rule and I was not
referred to any.  In my view the burden of proof of
discharge of the mortgage
lies on the second defendant.
<P>

21  	On behalf of the second defendant it was suggested that the
circumstance that a bank guarantee for $100,000 was provided to
support the
obligation of Lasovase in May 1997 tends to show that there was no longer any
need for Lasovase to have mortgage security,
and assists the finding that there
was then an agreement to discharge it.  I do not accept this, as the bank
guarantee was for less
than the whole debt and was secured in priority to the
equitable mortgage, thus diminishing the protection which it afforded while
leaving some protection.  
<P>

22  	Another matter relating to the probabilities is that in Mr
Byrne's bankruptcy Lasovase took the position and lodged a proof
of debt on the
footing that Lasovase was an unsecured creditor.  The position which Lasovase
took appears in an affidavit made by
its solicitor Mr Wowk on 27 April 1998 in
the bankruptcy proceedings - Exhibit 5 - in which he recounted that as proxy
for the plaintiffs
at a meeting of creditors on 2 March 1996 he said: <i>"The
clients whom I represent, Lasovase Pty Ltd and Nearhaze Pty Ltd are owed
approximately $243,000.00.  Lasovase and Nearhaze are
separate legal entities.
Each is entitled to prove with respect to the unsecured amount of the debt owed
to it.  In my opinion, Nearhaze
has security against the property at Balmain
for the full amount of the debt owed to it.  The fact remains that Lasovase's
debt was
and is unsecured.  Lasovase is entitled to vote for the full amount of
the judgment debt."</i>  The minutes of the meeting show that Mr Wowk voted in
respect of Nearhaze only, and did so for $1 on the footing that it had
sufficient
security.  Mr Wowk held a proxy form executed under seal by Lasovase
which asserted that Lasovase was an unsecured creditor for $243,759.43.
 In my
finding the form of the proof of debt and Mr Wowk's conduct at the meeting were
produced by doubt about which company was
entitled to security and were not
produced by any concession of the effect of some supposed discharge.

23  	In the same bankruptcy proceedings on 28 April 1998 Mr Couri
made an affidavit of 28 April 1998 on behalf of Lasovase (Exhibit
3) in which
(para 5) he referred to proceedings 9637 of 1997 in which Lasovase sued Mr
Byrne in the District Court at Sydney.  The
cause of action relied on was that
Mr Byrne acknowledged by deed dated 20 May 1997 that Mr Byrne owed Lasovase
$291,834.37 and agreed
to pay that amount by instalments, yet only paid
$65,000.  Lasovase claimed $226,834.37 and interest, recovered default judgment
for $239,763.16 for debt and $1,093 for costs, and proved for that debt in Mr
Byrne's bankruptcy.  In his affidavit Mr Couri said:

<P>

<i>"5.	The applicant has not taken and does not have any security in respect of
the judgment debt in proceedings no. 9637 of 1997 in
the District Court of New
South Wales.</i>
<P>

<i>6.	The applicant has not taken and does not have any security in respect of
moneys owed under the above-mentioned Deed."</i>
<P>

24  	Mr Couri annexed a copy of the Deed to his affidavit.  This Deed
is a strange document as it is not dated and does not describe
Lasovase as a
party to it; however taken overall its terms show that Lasovase was a party as
the Deed is an acknowledgment of the
debt to it.  The Deed does not mention
whether or not there was any security, although it refers to some arrangements
for payments
which were apparently to be made by companies related to Mr Byrne,
as well as acknowledging his own obligation.
<P>

25  	Nearhaze also lodged a proof of debt - Exhibit C - in the
bankruptcy claiming to be a secured creditor for $42,559.71; this
figure was
arrived at by asserting that there had been loans which by 1 March 1998 with
interest amounted to $242,559.71, that the
security was valued at approximately
$200,000 and the proof was lodged for the balance.
<P>

26  	Overall, the adoption by Lasovase of the position that it was an
unsecured creditor was accompanied by the adoption by Nearhaze
of the position
that it was a secured creditor; this was based on what I regard as a wrong view
of the outcome of an array of facts
and documents which is difficult to
interpret, and was not based on any acknowledgment that there had been an
agreement to discharge
the security.  The position taken by the plaintiffs in
the bankruptcy was not a tenable position; it cannot be right that Mr Byrne
was
an unsecured creditor to one of them for the whole amount and at the same time
a secured creditor to the other one also for the
whole amount subject to
inadequacy in value of the security.
<P>

27  	Delivery up and destruction of the form of mortgage could be of
no more than symbolic significance because the equitable mortgage
did not
consist of that document or significantly depend on it; the document referred
to Nearhaze as the mortgagee yet from 30 December
1996 the moneys owed were due
to Lasovase; this is reflected in the terms of the undated deed.  The
plaintiffs have obscured their
position by continuing to seek comfort from the
form of mortgage itself whereas whatever security there was depended on the
letter
of 21 December 1996. As a general observation about behaviour in
commerce, prudence would suggest that a discharge of an equitable
mortgage
would be recorded in writing for the same reasons as it suggests that an
equitable mortgage would itself be recorded in
writing.  
<P>

28  	Steps taken by the plaintiffs in relation to Mr Byrne's
bankruptcy proceedings do not support any clear finding about whether
there was
a discharge.  The position was very distinctly taken in several ways that
Lasovase was an unsecured creditor for the whole
$285,000; yet a proof of debt
was also lodged on behalf of Nearhaze.  No certain finding could be based on
the claims made in the
bankruptcy proceedings.
<P>

29  	In the face of this body of unsatisfactory material my
conclusion as a matter of fact is that the probabilities are against
finding
that there was an arrangement to discharge the equitable mortgage, or that it
was discharged.  If Mr Byrne did get his hands
on the form of mortgage and
destroy it, that event had no particular significance.  I am unable to find on
the balance of probabilities
that that event happened.
<P>

30  	I will state my conclusions.
<P>

Mr Byrne created an informal equitable mortgage over the Adolphus Street house.
He did so by his letter of 21 December 1996, which
followed a series of events
including his communications with Mr Couri in and after September 1996 recorded
in his letters, his preparing
the incomplete form of mortgage, executing it,
obtaining Mrs Byrne's execution of it, and delivering it incomplete and undated
to
Mr Couri, probably late in December 1996 but possibly at some time in the
previous few months.  The date when the document was delivered
cannot be
clearly established and is not of high importance.  The form of mortgage was
not treated as of any importance by taking
such measures as reading its
contents so as to notice that it was incomplete, dating it, stamping it or
lodging a caveat; some of
those things occurred later when the possibility of
conflict was observable.  What makes the events effectual against Mr Byrne and
his interest in the Adolphus Street house as an equitable mortgage is his
agreement indicated in the second sentence of his letter
of 21 December 1996,
and the words of acknowledgment directed to Lasovase which mean, on a whole
view of the letter, that Mr Byrne
acknowledged that at 30 December 1996
Lasovase would have a mortgage securing $285,000.  This acknowledgment was
given for value
in that Lasovase did incur a commercial bill liability for
$285,000 on 30 December 1996 which was applied in various ways for the
benefit
of interests associated with Mr Byrne, including the payment of Nearhaze's
overdraft.  The document which created the equitable
mortgage was the letter of
21 December 1996, understood with the facts of the following few days.
<P>

31  	The form of mortgage did not create the equitable mortgage.  The
letter of 21 December 1996 was of course not signed by Mrs
Byrne, and it does
not purport to have been written on her behalf or to express any agreement of
hers.  It is not even clear that
the letter of 21 December 1996 refers to the
mortgage document which she signed.  The letter of 21 December 1996 contrasts
with earlier
letters in which Mr Byrne purported to write about affairs of them
both and to record arrangements to which she was a party.  In
his letter of 20
September 1996 he includes Mrs Byrne's initials in the address at the top right
hand corner of that letter and in
the subject-matter heading of the letter,
"Loan: MF &amp; CM Byrne".  He did not however in signing the letter purport to
do so as
her agent, and the arrangements spoken of in that letter, although
they refer to loan funds of up to $150,000 advanced to MF &amp;
CM Byrne from
Nearhaze Pty Ltd &amp; Lasovase Pty Ltd, included a second mortgage only in the
context of documentation which was
to take place at or after 31 March 1997.
The transaction recorded in the letter of 21 December 1996 in which as at 30
December 1996
$285,000 would be secured to Lasovase is a completely different
transaction to that recorded or contemplated in the letter of 20
September
1996.  
<P>

32  	I do not find that in agreeing in the letter of 21 December 1996
to the effect that there would be an unregistered second mortgage
over the
Adolphus Street house, and in carrying out that agreement over the next few
weeks, Mr Byrne acted as agent for Mrs Byrne.
 He did not according to the
terms of that letter purport to do so; she is not referred to in the letter. A
finding that on 21 December
1996 he had her authority to create an equitable
mortgage over the Adolphus Street house cannot be spun out of the fact that in
September
1996 he had recorded an agreement which he attributed to her as well
as to him to create a mortgage to secure a different debt for
a different
amount and only in the event that it was not repaid by 31 March 1997.  Nor can
a finding that he had authority late in
December 1996 to agree on her behalf to
grant a second mortgage to Lasovase be based on the circumstance that at some
time between
September and 21 December she executed a form of mortgage in
favour of Nearhaze, in a form which was incomplete and ineffectual.
 There is
no evidence that she ever created any authority for the blank spaces to be
completed, and they never were completed.  The
fact that Mr Byrne had this
incomplete document and was able to give to it Mr Couri does not rationally,
support a finding that late
in December he had authority to agree on her behalf
to grant an equitable mortgage to Lasovase, which was not named in that
document,
for a further advance for which the role of borrower had never been
attributed to her.  The proposition that she was a party to an
equitable
mortgage is not assisted by incidental references, impliedly to her as one of
the borrowers, such as Mr Byrne's referring
in his affidavit to an obligation
as "Our loan".  These shreds of information do not form a basis for a finding
on the probabilities
that she gave him her authority to agree to create an
equitable mortgage.
<P>

33  	In my view Mr Byrne's agreement to give an equitable mortgage
over the house is effectual against him and his interest in the
house but not
against Mrs Byrne and her interest in the house.  In fact they were joint
owners of the house and were not at the time
owners of identifiable separate
interests, but his purported dealing with the whole creates a need to identify
his interest for the
purpose of enforcement, and the only available basis is
the basis of equality. It is now easy to give effect to that because their
joint interest has been converted into a fund of money.  Mr Byrne's interest
and now the interest of his estate in bankruptcy should
be treated as one-half
of the moneys paid into court by the first mortgagee.
<P>

34  	Although it could be that a right of subrogation exists, that
right could have no effect on the outcome because Mr Byrne's
interest in the
property was charged for other reasons with the whole advance made by Lasovase,
and nothing Mrs Byrne did created
an effectual charge  over her interest.  If
the form of mortgage had any effect, she would be a volunteer; there is no
evidence against
her that she gave it for value or that she was a party to any
agreement for value for the mortgage to be given.  The document itself
is
ineffectual, it could not be given effect unless it were rectified or
notionally treated as rectified for the purpose of equitable
remedies, and
there can be no equitable remedies against a volunteer.  Neither subrogation
nor rectification is available against
her, the incompleted form of document
has no effect at law because it is incomplete and because it is unregistered,
and its operation
is not aided by any equitable remedy.  In my opinion neither
Nearhaze nor Lasovase has any charge against Mrs Byrne's interest in
the
property or in the funds in court.
<P>

35  	On the other hand Mr Byrne's interest in the property was
effectually charged with the whole advance made by Lasovase of $285,000.
 There
was no written agreement for the amount of the charge to be increased for
interest or bank charges or otherwise.  The amount
of the charge was reduced by
payments totalling $65,000 and by recovery of $100,000 under the bank
guarantee.  The balance secured
is $120,000 which exceeds Mr Byrne's half
interest in the moneys in court.  Accordingly Lasovase is entitled to recover
all the money
in court which represents Mr Byrne's interest, and neither of the
plaintiffs is entitled to recover any part of Mrs Byrne's interest
in the
moneys in court.
<P>

36  	Politi Pty Ltd the fourth defendant had a charge over the
property and now has a charge over the moneys in court.  Politi's
compromise of
its claim was embodied in a consent order in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"By consent of the plaintiffs and the second and fourth defendants, the
Court orders that:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Of the funds in Court in matter no. 4813 of 1998, the sum of $45,000 be
paid out to the fourth defendant, Politi Pty Limited.</i>
<P>

<i>By consent of the plaintiffs and the fourth defendant, the Court orders
that:</i>
<P>

<i>3.	There be no liability for costs of the proceedings as between the
plaintiffs and the fourth defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>By consent of the second defendant and the fourth defendant, the Court
orders that:</i>
<P>

<i>4.	There be no payment out to the second defendant from the funds in Court
in matter no. 4813 of 1998 except upon 7 days prior notice
to the fourth
defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>The Court notes the agreement of the plaintiffs and the fourth defendant
that:</i>
<P>

<i>5.	The fourth defendant's claim to a security interest in the funds paid
into Court by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
Limited in no. 4813
of 1998 shall have priority over the plaintiffs' claims to the extent of the
$45,000 referred to in order 1 and
otherwise the plaintiffs' claims, if or to
the extent made out against the first and second defendants shall have priority
over the
fourth defendant'' claim.</i>
<P>

<i>The Court notes the agreement of the second defendant and the fourth
defendant that:</i>
<P>

<i>6.	The second defendant concedes that, as at 10 August 1999, no principal
lent by the fourth defendant under the loan agreement dated
13 November, 1997
(exhibit 1) has been repaid.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	The second defendant concedes that the fourth defendant is entitled to
payment out of the fund paid into Court in no. 4813 of 1998
in respect
of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	balance of unpaid principal (over and above the $45,000 to be paid
pursuant to order 1) under the loan agreement; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	interest thereon to the date of payment; in priority to any claim of the
second defendant for payment out of that fund."</i>
<P>

37  	The effect of the consent orders is that Politi Pty Ltd has a
prior claim to the plaintiffs to payment out of court of $45,000,
and has that
claim against the whole of the funds in court.  Politi has a further claim
which is only to be addressed after the plaintiff's
rights to the fund have
been satisfied.
<P>

38  	The amount paid into court is $201,005.82.  This amount will
have been increased by interest.  The claim of Politi to $45,000
falls on the
whole fund, which is thus reduced to $156,005.82.  $78,002.91 should be treated
as Mr Byrne's share of the fund and
is payable to Lasovase subject to further
consideration of interest and costs.  The remaining $78,002.91 is Mrs Byrne's
share and
remains subject to the claim of Politi Pty Ltd referred to in paras 6
and 7 of the Consent Order.
