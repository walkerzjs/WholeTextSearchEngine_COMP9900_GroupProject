<P>

<b>1243/98 - TERRIE CHRISTINE WEBBER -V- KEITH JOHN WEBBER</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application under the Property Relationships
Act 1984.  The parties admit in the pleadings that they were
in a de facto
relationship from February 1970 to December 1996.  There was some mention in
the evidence of separation for short periods
but the parties do not seem to
have treated it as terminating the relationship.
<P>

2  	There were two children born to the parties in the relationship,
Kellie Webber born on 5 April 1971, she now being twenty-eight
years of age and
Renee Webber born on 18 August 1993, and she is now twenty-six years of age.
<P>

3  	I will deal with some of the history of the matter.  The
defendant was born on 13 October 1946 and is now aged fifty-three 
years.  The
plaintiff was born on 22 September 1950 and is now aged forty-nine years.  It
was in February 1970 that they commenced
their de facto relationship.  The
plaintiff was then employed as a sales person in a shoe store and the defendant
was employed as
a bricklayer.  Neither party had any significant assets and
they lived in rented accommodation.  The children were born in 1971 and
1973
and in 1973 the plaintiff gave up work for some three years while she cared for
the children while they were growing up.  She
went back to her full time
employment in the late 1970s at Ethanor Pharmaceutical and had a number of
other positions.  In 1982 the
defendant who had been having some difficulties
with employment as a labourer and a bricklayer's labourer decided to purchase a
truck
with the right to contract with the Ryde Council.  
<P>

4  	The parties borrowed $12,000 from the defendant's father as a
loan and that was repaid in due course.  The loan was used to
commence the
business.  On 19 October 1987 the defendant's father died.  His estate included
a property at 7A Sewell Street, Ryde
and some personal effects.  He died
intestate and the estate passed to his three children one of whom was the
defendant.  One of
the other children was Stephen and on 1 November 1988 there
was a deed made between Stephen and defendant in which Stephen transferred
his
interest in the estate to the defendant for a consideration of $5000.  That was
substantially less than the value of his interest
in the estate.   Apparently
Stephen was in gaol and had an urgent need for money.  The plaintiff contends
that the funds that were
used were advanced from the joint savings.
Administration was granted in December 1990 in the estate and in October 1991
an arrangement
was made for the defendant to purchase the one third interest of
the other brother's interest in the father's estate.  That brother
had
predeceased leaving children who were entitled to take a one third share.  
<P>

5  	In order to buy out that one third share both the plaintiff and
the defendant obtained a State Bank mortgage in the sum of $65,000
over twenty
years.  The property was then transmitted into the defendant's name as executor
and on 20 December it was transferred
into the parties' joint names and a
mortgage taken out.  The parties had in fact moved into the property in 1989
and over a period
1987 to 1989 the property had been let to some friends of the
defendant on the basis that they would meet the outgoings and pay a
rent of
something in the order of $130 a week which the defendant tended to collect.
<P>

6  	In 1994 the parties re-financed that loan with Westpac and they
also then took out a business loan for $30,000 over a five year
period which
was also secured on the property.  This was used to purchase a truck for the
business.
<P>

7  	It was in December 1996 that the parties separated.  The
plaintiff left the home at 7A Sewell Street and the defendant remained
in
occupation and has been there ever since.  Notwithstanding the separation the
business that the defendant had been carrying on
was transferred to a company
in which the plaintiff was a shareholder but probably would not have a
beneficial interest.  As at separation
the amount outstanding on the mortgage
was approximately $51,000.
<P>

8  	In March 1997 the plaintiff sold the Holden motor vehicle which
the parties had purchased some time before.  She paid $19,450.97
off the
housing loan and the balance of the sale price, about $7000 was used to pay off
the car loan which the parties had taken
out to purchase the car.  In June 1998
the defendant gave up his business.  He had tried to sell but had been
unsuccessful.   As
a result of him commencing some action against the Council
on an employment related accident he lost his contract and ultimately
he sold
at this stage the truck for $26,000.  $6000 was used to pay out the loan which
was the business loan which the parties had
taken out in 1994 and the balance
was retained.  
<P>

9  	It is useful of course to look at the assets of the parties at
the commencement of the relationship and also at the conclusion.
  The parties
had no assets of any substance at the commencement of the relationship and for
many years lived in rented accommodation.
 Each of them contributed the whole
of their wages to their joint living expenses.  In the early years the
plaintiff concedes that
the defendant earned more than she did but she
suggested that when one took into account his absences from work through
strikes and
other matters, that the contribution would be equal.  She suggested
that he was off for about eighteen months in 1976.  It is important
of course
to note in these early years the plaintiff herself had been at home for three
years looking after the children, not earning
any income.
<P>

10  	There is a total absence of any records showing the parties'
earnings for the period prior to 1992.  The defendant conceded
in the witness
box that six months prior to him moving into the business in 1982 he had been
having a very thin time and that was
the reason why he changed.  The purchase
by the parties of the one third share in the brother Stephen's interest in 1988
was, according
to the plaintiff made from their savings.  There is very little
evidence other than what the parties say but it would seem to me
given their
work history that it is probably likely that any savings that they had up to
1988 would have been contributed to fairly
equally.  
<P>

11  	As I have mentioned the first piece of property that the parties
seem to have acquired was the business which the defendant
purchased in 1982.
There is some dispute as to whether it was $10,000 or $12,000.  There is no
documentation which resolves this
matter but it is probably not important
anyway.  The loan was from the defendant's parents and they charged no
interest.  Accordingly
to the extent to which there was a foregoing of interest
this is a contribution made on the defendant's side in respect of the parties'
property.
<P>

12  	The parties as I have said had joint bank accounts which they
maintained during the relationship.  The important piece of property
was of
course acquired from 1987 through to 1991.  In 1987 of course the one third
share passed to the defendant.
<P>

13  	In December 1996 the assets of the parties at the determination
of the relationship seem to be as follows.  There was the house
at 7A Sewell
Street, Ryde, the value of it at December 1996 does not appear in the evidence.
 However in 1991 it seems to have a
value of $161,000.  The parties are agreed
that at the present time it has a value of $305,000.  There was the Holden car
valued
at $27,000.  There was some furniture, the amount of which was not
valued in the evidence and some personal effects.
<P>

14  	There was also the business which the defendant was carrying on
at separation.  That was not valued and even though it might
have been offered
for sale, the offer for sale is not an indication of its value.  Probably the
best indication of its value might
be seen from the sale of the truck some time
after  termination.  There was also a joint bank account in the sum of $3244.

<P>

15  	The liabilities of the parties at separation were in respect of
the mortgage on the house approximately $52,000, a car loan
of approximately
$7000 and a business loan of a little in excess of $6000.  
<P>

16  	The subsequent events after separation are relevant for looking
at the property.  Importantly the car was sold by the plaintiff
and those
proceeds were used to pay out the car loan and reduce the mortgage on the
house.  The mortgage on the house then became
$31,108.  
<P>

17  	The business was not sold and from the sale of the truck $6000
was used to pay out the business loan and the balance of $20,000
was retained
by the defendant.  The defendant also retained the joint bank account with the
amount of $3244.  
<P>

18  	In considering the contributions of the parties there is over a
period from 1991 to separation contributions by the parties
in repayment of the
house loan, the car loan and the business loan.  The parties are agreed as to
the taxable income of the parties
for the period from 1992 to 1996.  
<P>

19  	The plaintiff's earnings over this period was $97,869 and the
defendant's $154,179.  Thus the defendant had available at least
half as much
again as the plaintiff in income that he contributed to their joint purposes.
The evidence, although it contained some
allegations of him spending money on
drink, does not really go to the extent of one being able to infer a
substantial waste of funds
by either party and the funds seem to have been used
for the purposes of the relationship.  
<P>

20  	An important contribution is of course in relation to the
provision of the house which was in the parties' joint names.  One
third
clearly was the contribution by the defendant to which he was entitled under
his father's will.  Another one third was the
result of the parties jointly
borrowing money to buy out one of the brother's children.  They each signed a
mortgage and took responsibility
for it and made repayments during the period
from 1991 to 1996.  The other one third share was that which was acquired from
Stephen
for $5000 in 1988.  
<P>

21  	The suggestion of the plaintiff is that the moneys came from the
joint funds. The defendant himself thought it might have been
some of the money
in the estate.  However, I think that is unlikely and it is apparent from the
letters dealing with the distribution
of the estate that the estate was got in
and in due course the sum of $13,223.99 was paid to the defendant.   In 1991 at
the time
of the purchase of the one third share of the brother's children it
would seem to me that the defendant is probably in error and
that the source of
the funds for the purchase of the one third share for $5000 is from the joint
savings of the parties.
<P>

22  	Clearly given that this purchase of $5000 was substantially less
than the value which was about $41,000, clearly there is an
advantage for the
parties.  It is a question of whether it was for the parties jointly or whether
the greater share should be attributed
to the defendant because it was his
brother's share which was purchased.
<P>

23  	I certainly do not think that the fact that the deed was made
between the brother and the defendant alone is determinative
of the matter.  In
cases such as this it is necessary to look at what the parties contribute to
the joint assets.  I am satisfied
that the purchase price of this was provided
by the use of the parties' joint savings which I have held was equally owned at
this
stage.
<P>

24  	The evidence is almost non-existent as to the circumstances
surrounding the purchase of this share and accordingly it seems
to me that this
one third share ought to be looked at as having been contributed to by the
parties equally.    I would assess the
contribution of the plaintiff as to one
third and the defendant two thirds subject to the question of the outstanding
balance of
the mortgage. 
<P>

25  	Given the incomes earned from the period 1992 to 1996 the
defendant contributed more towards the repayment of the house loan,
the car
loan and the business loan over this period.  However an off-set against this
extra contribution is the fact that after separation
he has retained $20,000
from the sale of the truck and the joint savings account of $3244.  The
defendant also received $13,223.99
at the time of the winding-up of the estate
which was financed by both parties' housing loan.   He gave no evidence of what
he had
spent it on but it is a possibility that some of it was applied to
re-carpet the house, painting and some other alterations that
were made at that
time.
<P>

26  	I turn to the question of the non-financial contribution.  The
homemaker's contribution were mostly those of the plaintiff.
 The defendant
says that he mowed the lawns and washed the dog and the cars and I accept this
evidence.  However there would be a
substantial amount of home making
contributions by the plaintiff over and above the defendant's contributions,
given the needs of
the children and the long period of the relationship.
<P>

27  	So far as parenting is concerned the plaintiff took three years
off to raise the young children before returning to the work
force.  The
defendant seems to concede that the plaintiff performed the parenting role.  He
gave no evidence of anything that he
had done in this regard.  It is necessary
to recognise these non-financial contributions in a substantial way and not in
a token
way.  See <b>Black v. Black </b> 15 Family Law Reports at 109.  They
were provided during the twenty-six years of the relationship.  Two children
were raised during
that time.
<P>

28  	In summary one has the property originally contributed to a to
one third by the plaintiff and two thirds by the defendant.
 The house and car
and business loans repayments coming from the greater contribution by the
defendant.  Thirdly the defendant's
retention on separation of the sum of
$23,244.  Fourthly the substantial home making and parenting contribution by
the plaintiff
over twenty-six years.  Fifthly the defendant's parents
interest-free loan in 1982.
<P>

29  	The remaining property of the parties is the house.  The net
proceeds would be in the order of $270,000 after payment of the
mortgage and
expenses of sale.  Having regard to the matters I have considered and the whole
of the evidence I am satisfied that
the appropriate order is one which gives as
suggested by the plaintiff in submissions, forty per cent of the net proceeds
of sale.

<P>

30  	The defendant wishes the opportunity to purchase the plaintiff's
interest in the property and this is not opposed.  Accordingly
I order:
<P>

	(1)	That the defendant pay the plaintiff by way of
<P>

		adjustment of their property interests the sum
<P>

		of $108,000 in exchange of a transfer of her
<P>

		interest in the property 7A Sewell Street,
<P>

		Ryde, the defendant indemnifying her against
<P>

		any liability under the existing mortgage on
<P>

		the property.
<P>

	(2)	In the event that the sum of $108,000 is not
<P>

		paid  to the plaintiff within two months from
<P>

		today's date I order that both parties do all
<P>

		acts and things and execute all necessary
<P>

		authorities, contracts and other documents as
<P>

		may be necessary to sell the property situated
<P>

		7A Sewell Street, Ryde, by public auction within
<P>

		two calendar months from the date hereof by an
<P>

		agent, auctioneer and at a time, and reserved
<P>

		price not to exceed $305,000 as agreed upon by
<P>

		the parties, or in default of agreement in respect
<P>

		of any such aspects within three working days, as
<P>

		nominated by the President of the Real Estate
<P>

		Institute of New South Wales or his nominee 
<P>

		appointed in writing for such purpose provided
<P>

		that the contract for sale shall provide for
<P>

		vacant possession on completion in thirty day
<P>

		and shall otherwise be in accord with the usual
<P>

		conveyancing custom and usage applicable to
<P>

		residential housing sales in the Sydney
<P>

		metropolitan area and on settlement of the said
<P>

		sale the proceeds therefrom shall be disbursed:-
<P>

		(a)	In discharge of any outstanding mortgage
<P>

			to Westpac Banking Corporation.
<P>

		(b)	In payment of all reasonable real estate
<P>

			agent's commissions advertising costs and
<P>

			fees, including any auctioneer's fee.
<P>

		(c)	In payment of the solicitor's reasonable
<P>

			costs and expenses in acting on behalf of
<P>

			the vendors.
<P>

		(d)	In payment of the balance as to 40 per cent
<P>

			to the plaintiff and 60 per cent to the
<P>

			defendant.
<P>

31  	So far as costs are concerned there was a Calderbank letter of
offer of 2 November in which the plaintiff was prepared to settle
it by taking
40 per cent of the property with no order as to costs.  She has in fact
achieved that.
<P>

32  	In the circumstances it seems to me that the appropriate order
is that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs on a party and
party basis up
to and including 9 November 1999 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.
<P>

33  	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
