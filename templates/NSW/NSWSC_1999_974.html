<P>

<b>			DOROTHY LILLIAN RANKIN &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Summary judgment)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 13
November 1997 seeks an order for summary judgment pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> r 2 of
the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> against the second defendant.  The plaintiff
relied on the affidavits of Joseph Cutcliffe Weston sworn 12 November 1997,
Alan Laubhan
sworn 21 September 1999 and Peter William Cornelius of 6 August
1999.  The defendant relied on two affidavits of Denise Margaret
Shields sworn
27 November 1997 and 10 August 1999.
<P>

2  	By statement of claim filed 28 February 1997 the plaintiff
alleges that on 22 January 1990 Gary Clarke, the second defendant
and the first
defendant became the registered proprietors of a property situated at 3/100
Park Beach Road Coffs Harbour (the property).
 On 28 April 1992 Gary Clarke and
the first and second defendants (the mortgagors) granted a mortgage to the
plaintiff in respect
of the property to secure a loan from the plaintiff to
Gary Clarke and the second defendant in the sum of $80,000.  On 28 April 1992
the plaintiff advanced to Gary Clarke and the second defendant the sum of
$80,000.  On 10 August 1993 the second defendant transferred
her interest in
the property to Gary Clarke. Gary Clarke died on 24 May 1995.
<P>

3  	On 21 November 1995 the mortgagors were in arrears of monthly
payments in respect of the mortgage.  On or about 22 November
1995 the
plaintiff served notices pursuant to s 57(2)(b) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b>
1900 (NSW) on the executor of Gary Clarke's estate and on the first defendant.
The plaintiff alleges that the mortgagors are in default
of the mortgage and
the plaintiff is thereby entitled to recover.  The plaintiff is not seeking an
order for possession against the
second defendant but alleges that it is
entitled to payment of a monetary sum
<P>

4  	By amended defence filed 23 August 1999 the second defendant
alleges firstly, that the plaintiff is estopped from claiming the
mortgage debt
from her because following the transfer of her interest to Gary Clarke the
plaintiff did not forward to her any loan
statements, correspondence, notices
or demands and because without her consent the plaintiff varied the loan by
fixing the interest
rate at 11% for the first 5 years and then reverting to the
current variable rate.  The second defendant also pleads that the mortgage
debt
due to the plaintiff should be paid firstly from the proceedings of the sale of
the property;  secondly from the first defendant
and thirdly from the second
defendant and that it was a term mortgage and it would be perfect as against
all co-borrowers, which
terms had been breached by the plaintiff and the
plaintiff owed to the second defendant a duty to ensure that the security was
perfect
as against all co-borrowers and this duty was breached by the
plaintiff.
<P>

5  	On 22 January 1990 Gary Clarke, Denise Clarke and Dorothy Rankin
(the mortgagors) became registered proprietors of the property.
 At that time
Gary Clarke and the second defendant were husband and wife.  Mrs Rankin is Mr
Clarke's mother.  On about 6 February
1992 Gary Clarke and the second defendant
made application to the plaintiff for a loan in the sum of $80,000.  From the
evidence,
it is unclear which loan approval schedule was approved.  There were
two, namely one dated 20 February 1992 and the other dated 28
February 1992.
Both applications for finance between the plaintiff and Gary Clarke and the
second defendant set out certain common
terms and conditions.  They were that
the amount approved was in the sum of $80,000, security was to be by way of a
registered third
party mortgage and the interest rate could be varied at any
time at the plaintiff's discretion.  In the loan approval schedule dated
20
February 1992, the monthly repayments were stipulated to be of $1,049 principal
and interest at a variable interest rate, interest
rate at 13.5% reducing to
12.5% for prompt payment.  In the loan approval schedule dated 28 February the
monthly repayments were
stipulated to be $1,137 principal and interest rate at
a variable interest rate of 15.25% reducing to 14.25% for prompt payment.
<P>

6  	On about 28 April 1992 the mortgagors executed a mortgage in
favour of the plaintiff in respect of the property.  The mortgage
provided that
the provisions of memorandum X647856 were deemed incorporated in the mortgage
and that the mortgagors would observe
such provisions (the memorandum).  The
memorandum provided relevantly  that the mortgagors would on demand pay to the
plaintiff all
moneys which Gary Clarke and the second defendant were liable to
pay to the plaintiff.  The mortgagors would on demand by the plaintiff
pay all
costs (including legal costs as between solicitor and client) expenses and
other amounts incurred or paid by the plaintiff
in respect of the mortgage.
The mortgagors shall at the option of the plaintiff be immediately in default
if there was default in
the performance of any term covenant, agreement or
condition contained in or implied by the mortgage or any collateral security.
The advance of $80,000 was made by the plaintiff to Gary Clarke and the second
defendant on 27 April 1992.  On about 10 August 1993
the second defendant
transferred her interest in the property to Gary Clarke pursuant to an order of
the Family Court of Australia.
 The plaintiff was provided with a copy of the
terms of settlement (Ex 1).  It is alleged that there has been default in that
payments
due under the mortgage have not been made since November 1995.
<P>

7  	On about 21 November 1995 notice pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2)(b)</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b> (NSW) as forwarded to the executor of the estate of
Gary Clarke and the first defendant.  No statements or notices were forwarded
to the second defendant by the plaintiff.
<P>

8  	The relevant parts of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> r 2 says:
<P>

<b>"2(1)	Where, on application by the plaintiff in relation to any claim for
relief or any part of any claim for relief of the plaintiff
-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	there is evidence of the facts on which the claim or part is based;
and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	there is evidence given by the plaintiff or by some responsible person
that, in the belief of the person giving the evidence,
the defendant has no
defence to the claim or part, or no defence except as to the amount of any
damages claimed,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may, by order, on terms, give such judgment for the plaintiff on
that claim or part as the nature of the case requires.</b>
<P>

9  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to remind
himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway
Commissioners</u></b> (1948-49)78 CLR 62, <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways</u> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> and <b><u>Webster &amp;
Anor v Lampard</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  I have reproduced some of the
passages quoted.
<P>

10  	In <b><u>General Steel</u></b> Barwick CJ, who heard the
application alone, referred to Dixon J's passage quoted above at p 130.  He
then stated:
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

11  	Barwick CJ also said:
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense."</b>
<P>

12  	In <b><u>Webster</u></b> Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ
reinforced the rigorous testing stating, at p 602:
<P>

<b>"The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with `exceptional
caution' and `should never be exercised unless it is clear
that there is no
real question to be tried."'</b>
<P>

13  	According to Rolfe AJA in <b><u>Zarb</u>:</b>
<P>

<b>"The demanding nature of the test is in no way lessened in circumstances
where there are the potential for difficult factual and legal
issues to arise.
Rather, as the decision in Webster made clear, it is heightened:  see also
Wickstead &amp; Ors v Browne  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1</a> and Esanda Finance Corporation
Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241."</a></b>
<P>

14  	The second defendant referred to a passage of Kirby P in
<b><u>NRMA v A W Edwards Pty Limited</u></b> (NSWCA unreported 11 November
1994).
<P>

15  	In the affidavit of Alan Laubhan sworn 21 September 1999, he
deposes that the second defendant is indebted to the plaintiff
in the sum of
$115,660.92 as at 28 August 1999.  He attached a loan schedule to his affidavit
in which he calculates the arrears.
 It is difficult to establish how this
amount of arrears is calculated.  There are two different approval schedules,
which refer
to different rates of interest and different repayment amounts
which could provide the basis for this calculation.  The loan arrangements
in
the schedule, are at odds with the loan agreement pleaded in the statement of
claim.  The statement of claim pleads at paragraph
(12) that the loan was for a
period of 12 years, 7 months with the first 5 years fixed at an interest rate
of 11.0% per annum and
then reverting to the then current variable rate,
presently 8.25% per annum.  Mr Laubhan also swore an affidavit to the statement
of claim stating that the allegations in the statement of claim are true.
There are at least two different bases for the calculation
of the amount due
and owing under the mortgage.  Either the statement of claim needs to be
amended or the amount owing in the affidavit
needs to be recalculated.
<P>

16  	As it is unclear how those arrears have been calculated and
there are different bases for that calculation and no explanation
as to which
one is the correct one, summary judgment should not be entered.
<P>

17  	In relation to paragraphs (8) to (11) of the amended defence the
second defendant submitted that when the plaintiff consented
to sign the
transfer of the property from the second defendant to the first defendant and
the second defendant's former husband,
Mr Clarke, the second defendant became a
surety not a principal debtor and the plaintiff has acted to her detriment.  It
was, of
course, the second defendant who sought the consent of the defendant to
the transfer of the property to her husband and his mother.
<P>

18  	In support of the second defendant's proposition she referred to
a passage from <b>Law of Mortgage</b> by Fisher &amp; Lightwood Butterworths
1995 which says at paragraph 14.17:
<P>

<b>"...When the mortgagor's interest is assigned with the consent of the
mortgagee, or, as it is sometimes said, the land is transferred
subject to the
mortgage, the original mortgagor will continue to be liable on his covenants so
that he is in effect a surety:  see
for example <i>Grove v Public Trustee
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1931%5d%20NZLR%201071" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1931] NZLR 1071</a>;<i>  Dennis v Martin </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1932/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] VicLawRp 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20VLR%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] VLR 361</a> and <i>McDonald v
Gardiner</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1933/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] VicLawRp 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1933%5d%20VLR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1933] VLR 129..."</a></b>
<P>

19  	I have read <b><u>Grove</u></b>, <b><u>Dennis</u></b> and
<b><u>McDonald</u></b> and they do not assist the second defendant's
proposition.
<P>

20  	The second defendant referred to another passage from <b>The
Modern Contract of Guarantee</b> by Drs Phillips and O'Donovan, the Law Book Co
Ltd 1992 which states:
<P>

<b>"Even if there is no variation of the terms of the main contract by
agreement between creditor and principal the guarantee may be
given upon a
condition that a specific security be obtained, perfected, protected,
maintained or preserved by the creditor.  The
term may be implied from the
circumstances, and oral evidence is admissible to prove the condition if it
amounts to a condition precedent
to the operation of the guarantee.  If such a
condition can be shown to exist any failure in the performance of the condition
will
operate to release the guarantor from all liability because the creditor
has not performed his part of the bargain.  As in the case
of a consensual
variation, it is irrelevant that the security which is impaired or lost by the
breach of condition has a substantially
lower value than the amount
guaranteed."</b>
<P>

21  	It is my view that the argument that when the plaintiff signed
the consent to the transfer the second defendant became surety
is hopeless.
Likewise the argument that the second defendant owed a duty of care to ensure
that the security held by it would not
be impaired and would be maintained and
preserved is also hopeless.  I have read the authorities cited.  These passages
and authorities
do not provide support for those propositions in circumstances
where the second defendant was instrumental in obtaining the plaintiff's
consent to the transfer.
<P>

22  	As the pleadings raised in paragraphs (8) to (11) in the amended
defence are hopeless they should be struck out.  The issue
of whether or not
the second defendant is estopped from making the amendment in paragraph (4) of
the amended defence is unnecessary
to decide because it relates to the
plaintiff's entitlement to possession against the second defendant.  The
plaintiff is not seeking
possession of the property from the second
defendant.
<P>

23  	Costs are discretionary.  As the plaintiff sought summary
judgment for a monetary amount and there is conflict between the
affidavit and
the pleading as to the terms of the mortgage which gives rise to different
amounts of arrears, it should pay the second
defendant's costs.
<P>

24  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Paragraphs (8) to (11) of the amended defence are struck out.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the second defendant's costs.
