<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore

<b>11 June 1999</b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	The Plaintiffs as holders of a right of first refusal seek
a continuance of the injunction restraining the Second and Third
Defendants
from exercising the option, granted to the Third Defendant or its nominees, to
purchase certain land consisting of Shop
11 in a shopping centre in Neutral
Bay. The injunction was granted on an ex parte basis against the Second and
Third Defendants.
This was on the basis that the Third Defendant had nominated
the Second Defendant as entitled to exercise the option. Though they
were both
on notice of to-day's proceedings, only the Second Defendant attended to-day's
proceedings.
<P>

<b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

2   	The Plaintiff is the lessee of the relevant shop and the
First Defendant the lessor and registered proprietor. The lease was
granted on
25 August 1995 and was subsequently extended on 20 May 1998. It gives the
Plaintiffs a first right of refusal ("right
of pre-emption") in the event of
property becoming "available for sale", such to "be on the same terms as any
offer to sell to any
other person or company".
<P>

3   	On 8 April 1998 during the continuance of the lease the
First Defendant granted an option to purchase to Felderri Pty Limited,
the
Third Defendant. That option was in terms permitting its exercise by either
Felderri or its nominee. On 4 March 1999 the Second
Defendant, Cenijade Pty
Limited was nominated. There is no evidence presently before me that the Second
and Third Defendants are
associated, other than as may be implied by that
fact.
<P>

4   	The exercise date for the option expires on 8 July 1999 and
the option remains unexercised. Its exercise depends on continuance
of the
injunction. The Second Defendant contends that it should be lifted as the basis
for its grant and continuance has not been
made out. This is on the basis that

<P>

(i)	there is no prima facie case made out for the grant of the injunction, as a
mere equity constituted by the right of first refusal
cannot prevail over the
prior equitable interest conferred by the option at least so far as its nominee
is concerned,
<P>

(ii)	the Plaintiffs in the events that happened would not be entitled to
specific performance of their claimed right, itself a mere
equity, to acquire
the relevant property by virtue of a right of pre-emption contained in their
lease, and
<P>

(iii)	the balance of convenience favours lifting the injunction.
<P>

But as to (iii) it was conceded that an early final hearing prior to expiry of
the option on 8 July 1999 obviates any damage that
the Second Defendant might
otherwise suffer, whereas lifting the injunction would irremediably deny the
Plaintiffs their rights,
if they have any, save for damages.
<P>

5   	The pre-emptive rights are conferred in the following
terms:
<P>

"1.	Should the lease premises be available for sale during the term of this
lease, including any option periods, the Lessor agrees
to grant to the Lessee a
first right of refusal to purchase the lease premises.
<P>

2.	Such right of refusal shall be on the same terms as any offer to sell to any
other person or company and will be open for acceptance
by the Lessee for a
period of 14 days from the date of offer by the Lessor."
<P>

6   	It is not in dispute for the purpose of the present
proceedings, that the pre-emptive right was triggered when the option was
first
granted. Nor was it seriously contested that the option constituted an offer to
sell to either the Third Defendant or its nominee,
being in the events that
happened the Second Defendant. Finally, it was not disputed for the present
proceedings that failure to
match the option terms by making them available to
the Plaintiffs breached their lease and in particular their right of
pre-emption.
The Plaintiffs for their part do not dispute that the option
conferred an equitable interest in the property on the Third Defendant
and then
upon its nominee the Second Defendant. While the Defendants do not dispute that
the Plaintiffs have at least an equity to
enforce their right of pre-emption
against the First Defendant, they do dispute
<P>

(a)	that it extends to the Second Defendant, and
<P>

(b)	that upon its first becoming exercisable, it became not just an equity, but
an equitable interest in the property.
<P>

7   	On 4 November 1997 the Plaintiffs wrote to the First
Defendant making clear that their preferred alternative was to purchase
the
shop "thereby guaranteeing our tenure and giving us the platform in which to
take steps to improve the performance of the body
corporate and the management
of the centre". There followed an offer of $135,000 but that offer it is clear
was not pursuant to any
exercise of a right of first refusal. Nonetheless this
evidence does suffice to establish that the property had a special value to
the
lessee, at least on a prima facie basis.
<P>

<b>PRIMA FACIE CASE</b>
<P>

8   	It was not disputed, at least for the purpose of the
present proceedings, that the Second and Third Defendants must be taken
to be
on notice of what I will call for convenience the right of pre-emption. This
was because the option included as an annexure
a contract for sale of the
relevant property attaching to which was a folio identifier that in turn
referred to the Plaintiffs' registered
lease. This concededly put the Second
Defendant on notice of its terms, including the right of pre-emption. Nor could
it be really
disputed that the Second Defendant must have been on notice that
the right of pre-emption had been triggered by the grant of the
option to the
Third Defendant. The Second Defendant knew it was acquiring no more than the
Third Defendant could confer by virtue
of the very option agreement pursuant to
which the Second Defendant was nominated. Thus on a prima facie basis, at
least, the Second
Defendant must be taken to be on notice not only of the right
of pre-emption but also that it had been triggered, with the result
that by its
terms the lessee was entitled to an offer in the same terms as that constituted
by the option itself. Whilst there is
no evidence either way as to the actual
state of knowledge of the Second Defendant beyond that, certainly it could
fairly be said
that the Second Defendant was on constructive notice of these
matters and thus on enquiry as to whether the Plaintiffs had exercised
their
right of pre-emption or waived it.
<P>

9   	Whether a right of pre-emption constitutes a mere equity
<i>prior</i> to the event triggering it has been settled by the authorities.
Such an unfructified right of pre-emption was described in the following
terms
by Street J in <i>Mackay v Wilson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%28NSW%29%20315" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 47 SR(NSW) 315</a> at 325:
<P>

`But an agreement to give `the first refusal' or `a right of pre-emption'
confers no immediate right upon the prospective purchaser.
It imposes a
negative obligation on the possible vendor requiring him to refrain from
selling the land to any other person without
giving the holder of the right of
first refusal the opportunity of purchasing in preference to any other buyer.
It is not an offer
and in itself it imposes no obligation on the owner of the
land to sell the same. He may do so or not as he wishes. But if he does
decide
to sell, then the holder of the right of first refusal has the right to receive
the first offer, which he also may accept
or not as he wishes. The right is
merely contractual and no equitable interest in the land is created by the
agreement."
<P>

10   	Here however, the event triggering the right of
pre-emption can be taken to have occurred. That in turn poses the question
which is more difficult and controversial, namely whether, a right of
pre-emption so triggered becomes equivalent to an option and
thus from that
time of its fructification confers an equitable interest over the relevant
property. I dealt with that question in
<i>Transfield Properties v Amos Aked
Swift Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2036%20NSWLR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 36 NSWLR 321</a> at 341 where I concluded that such a
right of pre-emption did, on triggering confer an equitable interest coincident
with its fructification:
<P>

"The more difficult and controversial question is whether, when the right of
first refusal is, as it were, triggered by the relevant
contingency, so as to
then constitute an option to the grantee to exercise such right and thereby
acquire the relevant property,
subject to compliance with the terms of the
right of first refusal, does from this point the grantee of the right of
refusal have
an equitable interest in the land? Thus it might said that there
is no difference in principle between the situation of an option
at the outset,
which confers an equitable interest in land and an option which arises later
upon the triggering of a right of first
refusal, other than their temporal
order."
<P>

The judgment then reviews the authorities at some length and concludes as
above.
<P>

11   	Kearney J in <i>Sterns Trading Pty Limited v Shteinman</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) NSW Conv R 55-414</a> held similarly:
<P>

"Once the right of first refusal had been triggered it was converted to an
option to purchase giving the grantee an equitable interest
in the land capable
of defeating a later equitable interest in a competition of priorities."
<P>

12   	Brownie J in <i>Walker Corporation Limited v Pateman Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 624</a> preferred the other view, that a right of
pre-emption was -- and remained -- a mere personal contract never capable of
conferring
an interest in land. Young J in <i>Beneficial Finance Corporation
Ltd v Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 510</a> however concluded
(at 526):
<P>

"... I should accept the view that whilst a right of pre-emption or right of
first refusal does not per se constitute an interest
in land, it may be in
certain circumstances that one can say that the grant of such right together
with contingencies which have
happened will mean that there has been by those
combined actions the grant of an option which does constitute an interest in
land."
<P>

13   	It can be seen that the balance of opinion, at single
judge level in NSW, favours the view that a triggered right of pre-emption
confers an equitable interest in land, though no Court of Appeal judgment has
finally settled the issue.
<P>

14   	But whether or not the right of pre-emption in the present
case remains a mere equity or has become with its triggering an
equitable
interest, I am satisfied that, on a prima facie basis, the outcome is that the
Plaintiffs have established sufficient of
a prima facie case to maintain their
interlocutory relief. Were the Plaintiffs simply to have a mere equity, there
is a serious question
to be tried as to whether the equitable interest
conferred by the option now residing in the Second Defendant should prevail, by
reason of the unconscionability inherent if it were to prevail. That is because
the Second Defendant must be taken to be on notice
of the triggering of the
right of pre-emption such that, on a prima facie basis it would be
unconscionable for the Second Defendant
thereafter to enforce its rights under
the option. In that respect, the position of the Second Defendant is arguably
analogous to
a bank which relies upon a secured guarantee given by a wife at
the behest of her husband who fails to understand it in an essential
respect.
Notwithstanding that the bank may have no actual knowledge of that fact and
recognising that the High Court has eschewed
resort to constructive notice in
favour of the doctrine of unconscionability, the bank will be precluded from
enforcing the wife's
guarantee on the basis that this would be unconscionable.
The wife's mere equity prevails over the bank's equitable interest, though
the
bank could have avoided that result by taking the reasonable steps which have
been laid down by the authorities; see most recent
<i>Garcia v National
Australia Bank Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20155%20ALR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 155 ALR 614.</a>
<P>

15   	It may be said however that the present case differs from
the spousal guarantee analogy because there is no equivalent to
taking such
reasonable steps as a basis for defeating the equity. It might be argued that
this renders the analogy inapplicable.
While recognising that argument may be
raised, I do not consider that it precludes at least a prima facie case to the
contrary. That
is a matter for argument at a final hearing. More recently,
Windeyer J in <i>Tanzone v Westpac</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/478.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 478</a> at para 39 dealt with
the matter similarly in broad principle in these terms, when considering an
equity of rectification of a lease
of which a purchaser of the lease had
notice:
<P>

"The benefits of the lessee's covenants run with the land on sale of the
reversion <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s117.</a> That does not make the assignee of
the reversion a contracting party with the original lessee. Nevertheless it was
accepted, correctly,
that although an equity of rectification of a lease is a
"mere equity" it is available or would bind a purchaser taking with notice
of
the equity, perhaps because it is attached to an equitable interest in land;
<i>Smith v Jones</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1954%5d%202%20All%20ER%20823" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1954] 2 All ER 823</a> <i>Downie v Lockwood</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1965/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] VicRp 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20VR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] VR
257</a>; <i>Equity and Law Life Assurance Society Limited v Coltness Group
Limited</i> (1983) 267 EG 949; Meagher Gummow &amp; Lehane Equity Doctrines and
Remedies 3rd Ed 429."
<P>

16   	He too was dealing with a mere equity, this time
constituted by a right of rectification. It arose however in the very different
circumstance where the other party against whom it was to be exerted was able
to resort to the indefeasibility of a registered title.
Though in that case the
equity of rectification did not prevail over the titleholder by reason of
indefeasibility, it is also the
case that indefeasibility does not
<i>automatically</i> bring to an end personal claims at law or in equity:  see,
for example, <i>Fraser v Walker</i> [1967] 1 AC 569; <i>Breskvar v Wall</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20126%20CLR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 126 CLR 367</a>; <i>Bahr v Nicolay No. 2</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 604.</a>
<P>

17   	The present case is in any event a stronger one, as
indefeasibility of title does not arise to defeat the equity. 
<P>

18   	Were the position that the Plaintiffs have not just a
personal equity but one which on fructification rose to the level of
an
equitable interest, then the contest would be then between two equitable
interests, the first in point of fructification being
that of the Second
Defendant and the second being the Plaintiffs. The question then is whether the
Second Defendant is to be treated
as having so conducted itself as to be
postponed to the Plaintiffs by reason of having at least constructive notice of
the circumstances
whereby the Plaintiffs derive their interest. Alternatively
the matter can be put in terms of unconscionability as before. Either
way the
result favours the Plaintiffs, at least on a prima facie basis
<P>

<b>DAMAGES AN ADEQUATE REMEDY AND BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE</b>
<P>

19   	I turn now to whether the Plaintiffs have sufficiently
established that damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accepting
as I do
that there is a serious question to be tried as to the Plaintiffs having an
equitable interest in the relevant property,
and in circumstances where it has
a special value to them, I conclude they have sufficiently established that
damages would not be
an adequate remedy. 
<P>

20   	As to balance of convenience, the early hearing date prior
to expiry of the option clearly tilts the balance of convenience
in favour of
the Plaintiffs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

21   	Accordingly, I make the following orders
<P>

(i)	The Plaintiffs' existing injunction should continue until further order
together with their undertaking as to damages.
<P>

(ii)	Costs should follow the event and be awarded to the Plaintiffs.
<P>

(iii)	I set the matter down before me for argument on a final basis on 6 and 7
July 1999.
<P>

(iv)	The parties are to file all affidavit evidence upon which they intend to
rely with the Plaintiffs doing so by 24 June 1999
followed by the Defendants by
2 July 1999 and the plaintiffs in reply by 5 July 1999, with copies to my
associate.
