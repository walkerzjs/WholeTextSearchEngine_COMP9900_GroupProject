1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  This is an appeal brought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
69</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a></b> 1970 against the determination
of a Magistrate given in the Local Court at Newcastle on 1 April 1999.  Having
regard to the date
of the determination, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> 1902

<P>

2   	The plaintiff seeks an order that so much of the verdict
and judgment of the Magistrate in which he: 
<P>

(a) 	entered verdict and judgment for the defendant in the amount of 
<P>

	$17,141.06;
<P>

(b)	entered verdict for the defendant on the plaintiff's cross-claim;  and 
<P>

(c) 	ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs 
<P>

be set aside.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff further claims that in lieu of such verdict
and judgment that there be entered in favour of him as against the
defendant:
<P>

(a) 	a verdict for the plaintiff on the defendant's claim;
<P>

(b) 	an order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the claim;
<P>

(c) 	a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff on his cross-claim against the

<P>

	defendant for $4,652.75;  and
<P>

(d) 	an order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's cross-claim.
<P>

4   	Alternatively, the plaintiff seeks an order that the matter
be remitted to a Magistrate to be dealt with according to law.
<P>

5   	Six grounds of appeal are pleaded in the statement filed
pursuant to rl 8 Pt 51B <b>SCR</b>.
<P>

6   	Mr Allen, who appears for the plaintiff, has only pressed
grounds 1 and 2 as they appear in that statement. Grounds 3 to 5
inclusive were
abandoned.  Ground 6, I note, merely contends in a compendious way that grounds
1 to 5 constituted errors on the part
of the Magistrate.  Ground 1 is in these
terms:
<P>

"That his Worship was in error in refusing to allow the appellant to
cross-examine the respondent in relation to whether or not
a contract had been
made between the appellant and the respondent for the erection of a shed on the
respondent's land on the grounds
that an alleged admission to that effect had
been made by the appellant's former counsel."
<P>

7   	The proceedings before the Magistrate occupied five days of
hearing between 26 October 1995 and 5 July 1996. The matter came
on for hearing
before the Local Court by way of re-hearing following an arbitration which took
place in late 1994.
<P>

8   	Shortly prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the
matter, the plaintiff's counsel sought an adjournment.  A date fixed
for
hearing had earlier been vacated on the plaintiff's application upon the basis
that he was not ready to proceed.
<P>

9   	It is against this background, and in the light of the
matters as set out in a chronology which was handed up on the hearing
of this
appeal, that the Magistrate refused the belated application that the hearing be
adjourned.  It commenced on 26 October 1995.
 The plaintiff's then counsel, Mr
De Pinna, was not in attendance and the matter proceeded with the plaintiff
appearing unrepresented.
<P>

10   	Evidence was taken on 26 October 1995, 29 February 1996,
and 1 March 1996.  On each of these occasions the plaintiff was
unrepresented.
<P>

11   	The matter was adjourned part heard from 1 March 1996 to 5
July of that year.  On the latter occasion, Ms Coombes of counsel
appeared for
the plaintiff.
<P>

12   	On 5 July an application was made on the plaintiff's
behalf that the defendant be recalled in order that Ms Coombes could
take up
with her a number of matters which her client had neglected to put in the
course of his cross-examination.
<P>

13   	That application was opposed by Mr Byrnes, the solicitor
who appeared for the defendant.  Mr Byrnes noted that his client's
case had
closed.  He submitted that it would work unfairness to him to have her recalled
at this late stage in the proceedings. 
He drew attention to the circumstance
that the plaintiff had the opportunity, notwithstanding his lack of legal
training, to question
the defendant about the subject matters during the course
of her evidence given on 26 October 1995.  His Worship determined that
the
appropriate course was to accede to Ms Coombes' application. The defendant was
then recalled and cross-examined by Ms Coombes.
 Thereafter, Ms Coombes opened
the plaintiff's case and called him.  
<P>

14   	At an early stage in her examination of the plaintiff,
objection was taken to evidence being led of a conversation between
the
plaintiff and the defendant which took place at their first meeting around May
of 1992.  The basis of objection was that the
terms of the conversation had not
been put to the defendant in the course of cross-examination by the plaintiff.
Ms Coombes had not
cross-examined the defendant as to the conversation when she
was recalled.  
<P>

15   	The Magistrate heard submissions from both Mr Byrnes and
Ms Coombes.  He took a short adjournment to refresh his recollection
as to the
course of the examination of the defendant on the earlier occasion and to
permit the parties to do so.
<P>

16   	Thereafter, the Magistrate ruled that he would not allow
evidence to be led from the plaintiff as to the subject conversation.
 
<P>

17   	The decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence
made in the exercise of the Magistrate's discretion is not one with
which this
Court would lightly interfere.  
<P>

18   	Ms Coombes did not disclose the nature of the material
such as to demonstrate that it was desirable in the interests of justice
that
the defendant be further recalled notwithstanding that she had once been
recalled and that the plaintiff's case had now been
opened.  
<P>

19   	There is nothing to indicate the substance of the
conversations which it is said were of such critical importance. 
<P>

20   	Mr Allen points to an exchange between the Magistrate and
the plaintiff on 26 October 1995 just before the plaintiff commenced
his
cross-examination of the defendant.  The Magistrate is recorded as saying this
at p.52:
<P>

"Now, Mr Walsh, you have the opportunity of asking Mrs Clouting questions in
relation to the evidence that she has given, matters
that are relevant to the
proceedings before the Court.  Ask your questions one at a time, give her an
opportunity to answer, don't
argue with her.  You ask questions, she answers.
If you don't agree with what she says you can ask her other questions about the
topic, but you can't disagree with her.  Your opportunity to do that arises
later if we get to a stage of you giving evidence, do
you understand me?"
<P>

21   	Mr Allen submits that the Magistrate's advice was capable
of misleading the plaintiff in so far as it might have been taken
by him as
indicating that it was not open to him to disagree with the witness in the
sense of putting a proposition to her in cross-examination
inconsistent with an
answer that she had given.
<P>

22   	Mr Allen submitted in the light of the above that the
exercise of the Magistrate's discretion must be said to have miscarried.
 The
plaintiff was denied the opportunity of giving evidence of conversations which
Mr Allen stated related to the question of whether
a contract had been formed
for the construction of a shed on the defendant's property and, if so, the
terms of any such contract.
 It was a matter of such crucial importance that,
even at the very late stage in the day when his counsel sought leave to have
the
defendant further recalled, the proper exercise of the discretion compelled
such a result.
<P>

23   	It should be noted that during the course of the
defendant's opening to the Magistrate on 26 October, it was said by Mr Byrnes,
who appeared for her by way of an outline of the plaintiff's case, as Mr Byrnes
apprehended it, that:
<P>

"As I understand it he says there was no such agreement between the parties.
Mrs Clouting was constructing a home and shed on her
property and Mr Walsh was
asked to help out when he could, do some labour, buy some materials which he
did.  He never had any agreement
to build the house or the shed."
<P>

24   	Later, during the course of that day (T74), Mr Byrnes
asserted that it was his understanding that there was no dispute between
the
parties as to an agreement on the part of the plaintiff that he would construct
the shed (as distinct from the house) on the
defendant's property.
<P>

25   	This appears to have been a reference to a letter, Exhibit
F, written by Mr De Pinna, the plaintiff's then counsel.  It is
dated 19 July
1995.  In paragraph 4 of that letter the following statement appears:
<P>

"The defendant alleges he agreed to construct a shed, only - as alleged."
<P>

26   	Mr Allen says that the admission in the letter was limited
to his client's agreement to construct a shed.  The terms of that
agreement
were germane to the issues before the Magistrate.  Accordingly, notwithstanding
the admission, Mr Allen maintains that
such prejudice was done by the
Magistrate's refusal to allow the evidence that I would conclude that his
discretion miscarried.
<P>

27   	During the course of the plaintiff's cross-examination of
the defendant on 26 October 1995, Mr Byrnes is recorded as making
an objection
and observing (T64):
<P>

"There has been cross-examination for half an hour now and we haven't had one
question about the agreement between the parties,
whether she took photos, when
she took the block. I really don't see the relevance of it."
<P>

28   	This is but one instance when it appears in the course of
the proceedings prior to the plaintiff obtaining representation
it was drawn to
his attention that he might ask questions of the defendant as to the terms of
the agreement.  I note from the Magistrate's
reasons that he assessed the
plaintiff as a person of ability, albeit one facing the difficulties that any
person would who seeks
to represent himself when not legally trained so to
do.
<P>

29   	In the light of the circumstance that when the matter came
back before him on 5 July, at a time when the plaintiff was legally
represented, the Magistrate allowed the recall of the defendant in order to
overcome any difficulties associated with the earlier
cross-examination and
having regard to the way the matter was agitated on the plaintiff's behalf at
pages 7 to 10 of the transcript
of 5 July1996, I do not consider that the
plaintiff has made good the submission that the Magistrate erred in law in
refusing Ms
Coombes' application.
<P>

30   	Ground 2 is in these terms:
<P>

"His Worship was in error in entering a verdict for the respondent for $4,038
for alleged rectification costs to the shed in circumstances
where there was no
evidence before his Worship that the respondent had performed her part of the
contract by payment to the appellant
of the contract price".
<P>

31   	Mr Walsh, who appears for the defendant, submits that the
plaintiff is estopped from relying on this ground.  It is necessary
for me to
refer to the history of the matter after the conclusion of evidence on 5 July
1996 in order to understand that objection.
 The Magistrate on 6 November 1996
gave what I might characterise as preliminary reasons for decision in the
matter.  In the concluding
portion of those reasons he noted that he had
realised he required the assistance of the parties' representatives on a number
of
issues as set out at page 9 of his reasons.  He re-listed the matter with a
view to entertaining further submissions.
<P>

32   	Thereafter on 20 December 1996 his Worship delivered
himself of further reasons.  At the conclusion of those reasons he noted
that
he was unable, on the material available to him, to determine a number of
issues relating to costs.  For that reason he proposed
obtaining further
submissions from the parties' representatives.  He set a timetable for the
receipt of those submissions and went
on to state that he would,  "Formally
give final judgment on the action and subsidiary matters on Friday, 21 February
1997".
<P>

33   	Thereafter it appears that the plaintiff, Mr Walsh,
commenced proceedings by way of stated case under the procedure which
then
applied in relation to appeals from Magistrates exercising jurisdiction under
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a></b>.
<P>

34   	The matter came on for hearing before his Honour Sully J
on 7 May 1998.  It appears that his Honour received evidence and
embarked on a
detailed consideration of a number of factual matters by reference to the
transcript of the proceedings before the
Magistrate.  At a late stage in the
day the parties drew to his Honour's attention the circumstance that the
Magistrate had not purported
to make a final determination.  His Honour
concluded that he did not have jurisdiction to deal with the appeal.
<P>

35   	His Honour made a number of observations concerning the
evidence and the approach identified by the Magistrate in his reasons.
Relevantly, at pages 5 and 6 of his Honour's judgment, the following
appears:
<P>

"So far as concerns that part of the proposed verdict for the plaintiff that
has reference to the cost of rectification work, the
position seems to me to be
as follows:
<P>

(1) The learned Magistrate has made a distinct finding that there was a
contract between the appellant and the respondent  for the
building by the
appellant for the respondent of a shed at a cost of $10,000.  It was not
suggested in argument today that such a
finding was not reasonably open to the
learned Magistrate on the evidence before his Worship."
<P>

36   	His Honour went on to observe that the Magistrate had made
what he described as an equally clear finding concerning the existence
of
building defects in the shed and to note that such a finding was "clearly open
to the learned Magistrate".  He then noted that
it had been necessary by
reference to admissible evidence to quantify the reasonable cost of rectifying
the building defects.  His
Honour noted that the Magistrate had had before him
a document marked as exhibit 16 and that by reference to that document the
figure
of $4,438 had been identified.  His Honour noted that he saw no reason
to question the availability of that conclusion. His Honour
further noted the
considerations that led the Magistrate to deduct the sum of $400 from that
global figure and again to conclude
that it was open to the Magistrate to
arrive at that finding.
<P>

37   	It is this aspect of his Worship's judgment, namely his
verdict for the defendant in the amount of $4,038 for alleged rectification
costs to the shed, that is the subject of ground 2.  That ground has been
developed before me as a no evidence ground.  Mr Walsh
suggested that in the
light of the way the matter proceeded before his Honour Sully J, the plaintiff
was estopped from taking such
a point.  Having regard to the circumstance that
his Honour concluded that he had no jurisdiction to deal with the stated case,
I
do not believe it can be said that the plaintiff is estopped, although the
failure to take the point now taken in the light of the
portion of his Honour's
reasons which I have earlier quoted is notable.
<P>

38   	In the way Mr Allen has developed the argument, he takes
no point that there was not evidence before the Magistrate to justify
a finding
that an amount of $4,038 was an appropriate figure for the reasonable costs of
rectifying the defects in the shed.  Rather,
Mr Allen points to a passage
appearing at page 8 of the Magistrate's reasons given on 1 April 1999.  His
Worship observed:
<P>

"It seems to me that the evidence of the plaintiff in relation to the various
amounts paid is somewhat vague and uncertain and in
all the circumstances it
seems to me that I could not, with any confidence, make a finding as to what
was paid to the defendant as
payment for work done by him and what was paid to
him as the plaintiff's agent to be passed on by him to others for whom
materials
or services were obtained."
<P>

39   	The submission is put in this way:  it is clear that the
Magistrate accepted that of the money paid by the defendant to the
plaintiff an
amount was referable to payment for work done by him, being building work, and
other amounts represented payments to
him as agent for the defendant in
connection with the supply of materials or services by others.  Given the
inexact nature of the
evidence given by the  defendant as to these matters, his
Worship was unable to conclude what, of any payment made by the defendant
to
the plaintiff, was referable to his services as a builder, and what represented
payments to him in his capacity as an agent. 
Mr Allen goes on to say in such a
circumstance the Magistrate could not have been satisfied on balance that the
defendant had incurred
a loss.  The shed must have been of some value.  Absent
clear evidence of payments to the plaintiff for building work in excess of
the
sum of $4,038 there was no evidence of loss.
<P>

40   	There was a conflict in the evidence before the Magistrate
concerning payments by the defendant to the plaintiff.  It was
the plaintiff's
evidence he was paid some money by the defendant.  This was of the order of
$3,000.  He was not able to say what
that payment represented.  Against this,
the defendant gave evidence that she had paid him an amount of $28,956.  It was
contended
that the payment of that sum had not been put in issue following the
service on the plaintiff of a Notice to Admit Facts.  I understand
his Worship
to have accepted, in total, a sum of the order of $28,956 was paid by the
defendant to the plaintiff.
<P>

41   	His Worship was not able to determine with any precision
how much of that sum represented payment for the plaintiff's services
and how
much had been paid to him as an agent.  However, I consider that his Worship
must be taken to have concluded that the defendant
had paid to the plaintiff an
amount for the construction of the shed in excess of the sum awarded by him by
way of damages for rectification
of the same.  It was the defendant's evidence
that the cost of the shed was going to be about $10,000 (26 October 1995, page
31 line
40 and following).  The plaintiff did not cross-examine Mrs Clouting to
the effect that he had not been paid in connection with the
construction of the
shed.
<P>

42   	It was not asserted by the plaintiff in his
evidence-in-chief that he had not been paid for work carried out in relation to
the construction of the shed.  Ms Coombes addressed no submissions in this
respect.  The matter complained of in this ground was
not a live issue before
the Magistrate.  To seize on his Worship's observations at page 8 of the
Judgment of 1 April and urge that
there was no evidence that the defendant had
suffered loss seems to me to introduce a somewhat artificial element to the
proceedings.
 I consider that it was open to the Magistrate to conclude overall
that the defendant had suffered loss justifying the award of damages
in the
amount of $4,038 in connection with necessary rectification work to the shed.
Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiff's summons.
<P>

43   	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the
proceedings as agreed or assessed.
