<b>50007/98   Murphy &amp; Anor v Swinbank</b>
<P>

<b>50138/98   Swinbank &amp; Ors v Cleary &amp; Ors</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	A reserved judgment in proceedings 50007 of 1998 (`the main
proceedings'), was handed down on 24 September 1999.  Proceedings
50138/98
(`the good faith proceedings') which were heard together with proceedings
50007/98 were only relevant should the Court find,
contrary to the position of
the insurers, that Cleary &amp; Hoare were entitled to indemnity under their
1991/92 policy.  As no such
finding was made, the Court found it unnecessary to
proceed to determine the good faith proceedings [see paragraphs 515 to 517 of
the Judgment].
<P>

2   	As paragraph 517 of the Judgment makes plain, leave was
granted to the parties having the benefit of the reasons for judgment
to
address submissions as to the need or utility in the Court, notwithstanding the
findings, to proceed to determine the good faith
proceedings.  In addressing
submissions to that matter, the Trustees submitted that the Court should
determine the good faith proceedings
as they were fully contested and fully
argued.  The Trustees' further submission is that it is necessary for the Court
to determine
the good faith proceedings in order to determine the appropriate
order to be made with respect to costs of those proceedings.
<P>

3   	The insurers on the other hand submitted that the Court
need not determine the good faith proceedings which in the event were
in
substance defensive.  As the insurers submitted, it was only a accident of
history that the insurers had been the plaintiffs in
relation to those
proceedings.  As the insurers submitted, the proceedings are properly to be
regarded in terms of the final hearing
as simply a further defence to the
insurers' battery of defences to the main proceedings.
<P>

4   	In complex commercial litigation, it is a question of
judgment as to in what circumstances the Court should go further than
to
determine the proceedings.  To my mind, the insurers having succeeded for the
reasons set out in the reserved Judgment, it is
clearly not strictly necessary
for the good faith proceedings to be determined.  I propose however to deal
with the proceedings against
the event that an Appeal in the main proceedings
be successful.
<P>

<b>The Good Faith Proceedings</b>
<P>

5   	The Judgment at paragraphs 45 through to 66 outlines the
good faith proceedings and the respective claims made in those proceedings.
 As
paragraphs 57 and following make clear, most of the background factual matters
relating to the good faith proceedings were not
in dispute.
<P>

6   	The detailed evidence going to the commencement of the good
faith proceedings is somewhat complex, involving as it does numerous
communications passing between Messrs Baker &amp; McKenzie, acting for the
Trustees, Messrs Cleary &amp; Hoare and Messrs Kemp Strang
who were instructed
to act on behalf of Mr Hoare and Messrs Cleary &amp; Isles.  Mr Hoare's
position is summarised in paragraphs
6 and 7 of his statement in these
terms:
<P>

<i>`I have provided instructions to the solicitors who have represented:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Cleary &amp; Hoare in the proceedings brought against Cleary &amp; Hoare
by John Murphy and Peter Allen ("the Trustees"), proceedings
No 1802 of 1991 in
the Supreme Court of Queensland which subsequently became proceedings No 5870
of 1994 in the Supreme Court of
Victoria (the "Cleary &amp; Hoare
Proceedings");  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Messrs Cleary and Isles and myself in the proceedings brought against us
by Cleary &amp; Hoare's insurers under the 1991/92 policies
of professional
indemnity insurance ("the Insurers"), which are these proceedings ("the
Insurers' Proceedings").</i>
<P>

<i>In the course of settlement discussions in relation to the Cleary &amp;
Hoare Proceedings in mid-1997 I was asked by Messrs Cleary
and Isles to provide
instructions on their behalf to solicitors retained on behalf of Cleary &amp;
Hoare.  I agreed to this request
and have, since that time, provided
instructions on their behalf in respect of both the Cleary &amp; Hoare
Proceedings and the Insurers'
Proceedings.  I have adopted the practice of
keeping Messrs Cleary and Isles up to date with developments and inform them of
any
significant matters.'</i>
<P>

7   	The history of the good faith proceedings involves the
circulation of draft pleadings from time to time and includes interlocutory
applications.  Also received into evidence were advices received by Mr Hoare
from counsel and from Mr Baird of Kemp Strang.
<P>

8   	On or about 12 November 1998, Mr Hoare received a telephone
call from Mr Connor of Baker &amp; McKenzie who, in referring to
the settlement
of the Cleary &amp; Hoare proceedings on 29 October 1997, said words to the
effect "Material has turned up indicating
that there may be a claim under the
1991/92 policies.  The Trustees want to take an assignment of these policies.
However this will
probably be resisted by the insurers.  You will need to get
your own legal advice on this issue".  [Statement of Mr Hoare of 23 July
1999
at paragraph 8].
<P>

9   	Mr Hoare thereafter became involved and on 13 November 1998
wrote to Mr Connor referring, inter alia, to the difficulty in
certain of
Cleary &amp; Hoare's files having been taken over `by the Court' and agreeing,
if the required assignment document was
sent to him, to approach the
parties.
<P>

10   	On 20 November 1998, Mr Connor enclosed a draft Deed of
Assignment under cover of his letter to Mr Hoare.
<P>

11   	Mr Hoare forwarded the draft memorandum to Messrs Cleary
&amp; Isles on 23 November 1998.
<P>

12   	On about 24 November 1998, Mr Hoare received from
Ebsworths a letter putting Cleary &amp; Hoare on notice that in the view
of the
insurers:
<P>

(a)	any purported assignment by Cleary &amp; Hoare in respect of the year 3
policy year would be a breach of the duty of utmost
good faith imposed on
Cleary &amp; Hoare by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a></i>;
<P>

(b)	by reason of clause 11 of the Deed of Settlement, there was no loss to
which Cleary &amp; Hoare were exposed in relation to
the PMA1 and PMA2 judgment
debts which could found any claim under the 1991/92 policies;
<P>

(c)	it followed that any purported assignment by Cleary &amp; Hoare in respect
of the 1991/92 policy year would cause prejudice
to the insurers who may be
joined to the existing proceedings and be required to deal with claims for in
excess of $80million in
circumstances where there was no legitimate interest of
Cleary &amp; Hoare to protect by such assignment.
<P>

13   	The letter further advised that the insurers proposed to
seek orders without further notice restraining Messrs Murphy &amp;
Allen from
entering into the proposed assignment in respect of the year 3 policy year.
<P>

14   	On 25 November 1998 these proceedings were commenced by
the filing of a summons and on the same day by the granting of interlocutory
relief.  The insurers were the plaintiffs.  The first defendants were Messrs
Cleary, Hoare and Isles.  The second defendants were
the Trustees.  The summons
identified the nature of the dispute in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`In proceedings no 50007 of 1998 . . . [the Trustees] as assignees of [the
solicitor's] rights under primary and excess professional
indemnity policies
for the [years 1 and 2], sue the primary and excess insurers for those years.
The assignment of those rights occurred
pursuant to a settlement of the Estate
Mortgage litigation.  As part of the settlement [the solicitors] consented to
judgments in
favour of [the Trustees].  [The Trustees] agreed to take an
assignment of [the solicitors] insurance rights for the [year 1 and 2]
policy
years in full and final satisfaction of the judgment debt.</i>
<P>

<i>[The Trustees] now wish to take a further assignment of [the solicitors]
rights under the [year 3 policy].  [The Insurers] seek to
restrain the
defendants from entering into any such assignment.  [The Insurers] contend that
in the circumstances any such assignment
would be a breach of [the solicitors]
obligations of utmost good faith implied into contracts of insurance by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a>.  They further contend that there is no
loss suffered by [the solicitors] within the meaning of those policies now that
the Estate
Mortgage litigation has been settled on the terms referred to
above.'</i>
<P>

[Summons - Nature of dispute section A]
<P>

15   	In addition to interlocutory relief, the summons sought
damages for breach of the implied term of utmost good faith and for
inducing of
breach of contract.
<P>

16   	The injunctions which restrained the proposed assignment
were later replaced by undertakings given to the Court by the Trustees
and the
solicitors not to enter into any agreement having the effect of the subject
assignment until further order.
<P>

17   	Paragraph 20 of the notice of contentions section of the
summons was in the following terms:
<P>

<i>'20.	The defendants threaten unless restrained to enter into such an
assignment.'</i>
<P>

18   	The proceedings then progressed through two cross-claims
filed by the Trustees.  The first cross-claim was filed on 10 December
1998 and
joined the Insurers as cross-defendants.  The cross-claim was later amended on
23 April 1999.
<P>

19   	The first cross-claim sought a declaration that an
assignment by Cleary &amp; Hoare to the Trustees of their right, title
and
interest in and to the obligation of the Insurers under the year 3 policies of
professional indemnity insurance would not breach
the term of utmost good faith
implied in those policies.  The summons also sought a declaration that the
Insurers were guilty of
misleading and deceptive conduct and a further
declaration that the Trustees and Cleary &amp; Hoare were at liberty to
negotiate
an assignment by Cleary &amp; Hoare to the Trustees of their right,
title and interest in and to the obligations of the Insurers
under the year 3
policy.  The summons also sought damages.
<P>

20   	A defence to the first cross-claim was filed on 11 May
1999.
<P>

21   	The Trustees' second cross-claim was filed on 15 December
1998.  The cross-defendants were Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles.
 In this
second cross-claim, the Trustees claimed a declaration that they were entitled
to rectification of the First Settlement
Agreement by the inclusion of the year
3 policy.  Alternatively, a declaration was sought that the Trustees were
entitled to rescind
the Settlement Agreement.  A declaration was sought that
the Trustees and Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles were at liberty to negotiate
an
assignment by Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles to the Trustees of their right,
title and interest in and to the obligations of the
Insurers under the year 3
policy.  Damages were also sought.
<P>

22   	An allegation in the contentions section of the second
cross-claim read as follows:
<P>

<i>`7.	The Trustees and Cleary &amp; Hoare entered into the Settlement
Agreement with the corresponding contractual intention that the
Trustees would
have recourse to all policies of professional indemnity insurance that might
indemnify Cleary &amp; Hoare against
or respond to the Trustees' claims
including but not limited to the [year 1 and 2 policies].'</i>
<P>

23   	The contentions also claimed alternatively that the
Trustees and Cleary &amp; Hoare had entered into the Settlement Agreement
under
a common mistake as to the subject matter of the Settlement Agreement and in
the further alternative that the Trustees had
entered into the Settlement
Agreement under a unilateral mistake as to the subject matter of the Settlement
Agreement and that Cleary
&amp; Hoare knew or ought to have known of the
Trustees' mistake and did not draw the Trustees' attention to that mistake.
<P>

24   	Again in the alternative, the Trustees sought relief by
way of an entitlement to rescind the Settlement Agreement.
<P>

25   	Paragraphs 12 and following of the notice of contentions
section of the second cross-claim pleaded that prior to the Settlement
Agreement, Cleary &amp; Hoare had represented to the Trustees that the only
policies responding to the Trustees' claim against them
were the year 1 and 2
policies and that the only claims made by Cleary &amp; Hoare were claims made
under the year 1 and 2 policies.
 The pleading asserted that those
representations were also made by silence in circumstances where Cleary &amp;
Hoare had supplied
the Trustees with information as to the policies that
responded to the Trustees' claims against them, knew that the Trustees would
rely or would likely rely on the information provided and where Cleary &amp;
Hoare accordingly were said to have a duty to disclose
the true position to the
Trustees.
<P>

26   	The Trustees then pleaded that in reliance upon those
representations, the Trustees had entered into the Settlement Agreement
and had
not included a term in the Assignment by which Cleary &amp; Hoare assigned to
the Trustees their right, title and interest
in and to the obligations of the
Insurers under the year 3 policy.
<P>

27   	A claim was made that the representations breached section
52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> and equivalent sections in the <i>Fair
Trading Acts</i> by way of conduct said to have been misleading or deceptive or
likely to mislead or deceive.
<P>

28   	Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the second cross-claim were in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>'16.	By reason of the matters in paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15, the Trustees
are entitled to rescind the Settlement Agreement and/or
are entitled to
damages.</i>
<P>

<i>17.	</i><cite>If the Trustees are unable to obtain rectification of the
Settlement Agreement the Trustees will suffer loss and damage</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Particulars</i>
<P>

<cite>The difference between the amount that the Trustees are able to recover
from the Insurers under the year 1 and 2 policies and the
PMA 1 judgment debt
of $61,212,845 and the PMA 2 judgment debt of $22,355,706</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[emphasis added]
<P>

29   	The defence to the second cross-claim filed by Messrs
Cleary, Hoare and Isles on 15 December 1998, admitted the allegations
contained
in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the contentions.
<P>

30   	The proceedings came before Hunter J on 15 February 1999
as an application under Part 18 Rule 3 on the basis of admissions
made by the
solicitors, admitting the requisite common intention of the parties to the
agreement and admitting the entitlement of
the Trustees to rectification.
<P>

31   	Hunter J released the Trustees from the undertakings which
had been given to the Court so as to permit the proposed assignment
to go
forward and granted leave to have general amendments to pleadings so as to
permit all issues to be properly raised at the one
time, on the final hearing
of the main proceedings and of the good faith proceedings.
<P>

32   	The summons was later amended on 8 June 1999 and a number
of defences and further amended defences were filed by the solicitors
and the
Trustees in relation to the summons.
<P>

33   	The Second Settlement Agreement effectively comprised a
compromise of the second cross-claim which it is common ground no
longer
requires to be determined.  The first cross-claim remains on foot and was
amended in April 1999, the Insurers filing an amended
defence on 11 May
1999.
<P>

34   	The central focus of the insurers' position taken in the
good faith proceedings was clearly notified in the contentions paragraph
A of
the draft summons forwarded by Ebsworths to Cleary &amp; Hoare on 24 November
1998 [part of JJH 7 to Mr Hoare's statement].
 Those paragraphs were in close
to identical terms to the terms set out in paragraph 14 of this Judgment.
<P>

35   	Following service of the summons, Baker &amp; McKenzie
wrote to Kemp, Strang &amp; Chippindall on 2 December 1998 [JJH 9].
 A copy of
this letter is appended to this Judgment.  The letter set the scene for the
claims made by the Trustees against the solicitors.
<P>

36   	It is important to note that in their defence to the
summons dated 10 December 1998, the solicitors in answer to paragraph
20 of the
plaintiffs' contentions, said as follows:
<P>

<i>`The first defendants:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	say, and it is a fact, that it was the intention of the first defendants
to assign to the second defendants their right, title
and interest, whether at
law or in equity from time to time in and to the obligations of the insurers
under any policy of professional
indemnity insurance available to the first
defendants in respect of the PMA 1 and PMA 2 judgment debts including the
1991/92 policies;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	say, and it is the fact, that such intention was shared by the second
defendants at the time of entering into the settlement;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	say, and it is the fact, that the settlement does not accurately record
the intentions of the first defendants and the second
defendants;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	say, and it is the fact, that the first defendants and the second
defendants are entitled to rectify the settlement such that
it properly records
the mutual intentions of the first defendants and the second defendants and/or
enter into a further assignment.</i>
<P>

37   	Following the decision of Justice Hunter, Baker &amp;
McKenzie wrote to Kemp Strang, a letter of 22 April 1999, a copy of
which is
also annexed to this Judgment [JJH 13].  That letter clearly stated that the
Insurers' belief in October 1997 as to the
relevant policies and their
consequent mistake was based on statements made by solicitors acting on behalf
of Cleary &amp; Hoare
as well as the insurers under the year 1 and year 2
policies.
<P>

38   	By memorandum dated 29 April 1999, Mr Hoare advised Messrs
Cleary and Isles in relation to the Baker &amp; McKenzie letter
of 22 April,
inter alia, as follows:
<P>

<i>`I have instructed Kemp Strang to . . . brief counsel to confirm that on the
facts known as to whether their claim for rescission
has reasonable prospects
of success.</i>
<P>

<i>The matter is complex, and more than anything else, I am concerned to avoid
a situation where I am caught with a legal bill of a couple
of hundred thousand
dollars.  . . .'</i>
<P>

[JJH 14]
<P>

39   	An Advice was then given by Mr Simon White of counsel to
the solicitors.  A copy of that Advice is appended to this Judgment
and is
dated 4 May 1999 [JJH 16].
<P>

40   	Ultimately, the Second Settlement Agreement was entered
into.
<P>

41   	The central witness in relation to the good faith
proceedings was Mr Hoare.  A close attempt was made in his cross-examination
to
establish that the Second Settlement Agreement was not negotiated at arm's
length and in particular to establish that Mr Hoare
was prepared from the
outset to transfer or assign whatever rights he had to the Cleary &amp; Hoare
year 3 policies to the Trustees
so long as they gave him an appropriate
indemnity.  The purport of these questions was to seek to establish that the
firm was so
prepared.  The insurers sought to establish that whilst Cleary
&amp; Hoare were notionally obtaining independent legal advice, that
was
apparently controlled by the Trustees.  The insurers sought to undermine Mr
Hoare's evidence to the effect that he and his partners
acted on the basis of
legal advice which they received.  The insurers sought to establish that it was
misleading for Mr Hoare to
assert that he intended to assign anything more than
the rights under the years 1 and 2 policies.  The insurers sought to establish
that Mr White's advice of 4 May 1999 to the effect that the Trustees had
reasonable to good prospects of obtaining an order for rescission
based upon
common mistake, became a self fulfilling piece of advice which was not based
upon proper instructions.  On the insurers'
submissions this advice,
unsurprisingly, produced the expected answer.  The insurers sought to suggest
that the initial instructions
given to Mr White were that there was a mutual
mistake, so that it was unsurprising to find a legal adviser giving advice that
the
chances of rescission were good.
<P>

42   	There was no dispute that there was implied into the
contract of insurance relationship a term requiring Cleary &amp; Hoare
to act
towards the insurers in respect of any matter arising under or in relation to
the policies of insurance with the utmost good
faith (section 15 <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance
Contracts Act 1984</a></i>).
<P>

43   	I accept that the expression `utmost good faith' would
readily extend to a case where an insured who was already protected
from suit
by a release would act so as to potentially put his insurers at risk.  The
obligation is of course not merely one of good
faith but one of utmost good
faith.
<P>

44   	The question which arises is as to whether by reason of
the rescission of the First Settlement and the entry into the Second
Settlement, Cleary &amp; Hoare in exposing the Insurers to a substantial
potential judgment, did so in circumstances where they had
genuine concern as
to their exposure in a suit by the Trustees against them to set aside the first
settlement.
<P>

45   	Prior to the First Settlement Agreement, the Trustees had
been informed by solicitors acting for both the insurers and Cleary
&amp; Hoare
that the relevant policy year was year 2, because of a notification of
circumstances which ultimately became the Trustees'
claim having been given by
Cleary &amp; Hoare on 7 August 1990 - facsimile from Coltmans to Baker &amp;
McKenzie of 8 August 1994
which stated "this matter was notified in August
1990".  A further facsimile from Coltmans to Baker and McKenzie of 12 December
1994
was to the same effect.
<P>

46   	In my view, the evidence establishes that had the Trustees
known of the terms of the August 1990 notification and that Cleary
&amp; Hoare
had made a claim or notification during the currency of the year 3 policies,
they would not have entered into the First
Settlement Agreement unless the year
3 policies were included in the assignment.  I accept as reliable, Mr Connor's
evidence which
was in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`If I had seen or been informed of the substance of the notifications of 7
August 1990 and 21 November 1991 and if I had been informed
or otherwise made
aware that Cleary &amp; Hoare had notified their insurers of the trustees'
claim on 5 May 1992, or that they had
otherwise made a claim or notification in
respect of the subject matter of the trustees' claim during the currency of the
1991/92
policy year, I would not have advised the trustees to enter into a
settlement which incorporated assignments as against the insurers
for the
1989/90 and 1990/91 policy years only.  At the very least, I would have
included an assignment of all and any rights against
the 1991/92 insurers in
addition to the earlier years.  Alternatively, I may have recommended to the
trustees that the assignment
be worded more generally to cover all possible
claims for all possible years.'</i>
<P>

[Paragraph 75 of Mr Connor's statement]
<P>

47   	In my view, the evidence establishes that Cleary &amp;
Hoare acted on the basis of advice from their counsel and solicitors
in
entering into the Second Settlement Agreement.  In this regard, I accept the
evidence of Mr Hoare as reliable.  That advice, I
accept, was to the effect
that the Trustees had reasonable to good prospects of obtaining rescission of
the First Settlement Agreement.
 [See the advice given by Mr White on 4 May
1999.]  Such a rescission would, in my view, have left Cleary &amp; Hoare
potentially
exposed to claims in excess of $80million. 
<P>

48   	Focus is then squarely to be addressed to the evidence
given by Mr Hoare and to his cross-examination.
<P>

49   	Mr Hoare accepted at transcript 272 that in 1997 it became
apparent that there were problems in relation to representation
for Cleary
&amp; Hoare because of potential actual or potential conflicts of interest on
the part of the solicitors, so that the
solicitors Maddock Lonie &amp; Chisholm
ultimately represented Cleary &amp; Hoare in the settlement negotiations.
<P>

50   	At transcript 273, Mr Hoare gave evidence which I accept
as reliable, that at the time when the proceedings were settled,
he did not
direct his mind to the question as to what policies of insurance were relevant
to the proposed assignment.  He was quite
certain about this matter.  He was
equally certain that as far as he was aware, no other person directed their
mind to that matter
and that it was not the case that at the time of the first
settlement, he was intending to transfer his indemnity rights in relation
to
year 3.  This was simply not a question - transcript 274.
<P>

51   	At transcript 276, he gave the following evidence :
<P>

<i>`Q.	You never had any intention about assigning polices other than the
1989/90 and 1990/91 policies, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I assigned what I was asked to assign.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Precisely, and you weren't asked to assign the policies for the 1991/92
policy year?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was not and I did not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you have told us earlier that it was simply a non issue and it didn't
enter into your mind, the question of the third policy
year, correct?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It didn't enter into my mind.'</i>
<P>

52   	At transcript 282, Mr Hoare gave the following evidence
when cross-examined in relation to the defence to the second cross-claim:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . You knew that there was no contractual intention on the part of
Cleary &amp; Hoare to transfer any policies in 1997, other
than those for years
1 and 2.  You have agreed with me about that, haven't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have agreed certainly that is the effect of the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I am not asking about the effect of the contract, I am asking about your
intention?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Okay.  I have found this a difficult matter and - my intention was to
assign whatever rights I had against my insurance.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Your intention - you had no such intention in 1997, did you Mr
Hoare?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I did.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would have assigned year 3 if you had been asked to?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I would.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But you never were asked?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it did not occur to you to even think about any year other than year
1 or year 2, did it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	A little bit more than that.  It didn't even occur to me to think about
year 1 or year 2.'</i>
<P>

53   	At transcript 284, Mr Hoare gave evidence under
cross-examination as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Is it the case that you believed that the correct policy year for this
claim was year 2?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did not direct my mind to it.  I had no belief.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you had no belief one way or another as to which was the correct
policy year?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.'</i>
<P>

54   	At transcript 286, Mr Hoare gave evidence that the
intention of Cleary &amp; Hoare was `to assign whatever it was asked to
assign'.
<P>

55   	In the result, I accept Mr Hoare's evidence as reliable
when he said that in the First Settlement Agreement he assigned what
he was
asked to assign, that he didn't think of any policy year in 1997 and had no
belief one way or the other as to which was the
correct policy year.  I accept
his evidence to the effect that the assertion in paragraph 20(a) of the defence
to cross-claim was
that Cleary &amp; Hoare would have assigned <u>any</u>
rights they had against the insurers under any policy.  Although in
cross-examination Mr Hoare agreed that the common mistake pleaded
in paragraph
8 of the cross-claim was inappropriate, he did not accept that there was no
common mistake.  His evidence was that the
intention of Cleary &amp; Hoare was
to assign whatever it was asked to assign.  The cross-examination did not
establish the proposition
that the factual basis of Mr White's advice was not
made out nor the conclusion that it was inappropriate for Cleary &amp; Hoare
to
rely on that advice.
<P>

56   	On my findings, Mr Hoare's belief was that he was
assigning the relevant policies of insurance and that he believed he was
assigning the right policies and the appropriate policies but that he never
directed his mind to what those policies were.  On my
findings, Mr Hoare
believed that there had been a common mistake and the basis of that belief was
his preparedness and the preparedness
of Cleary &amp; Isles to assign whatever
rights they had against their professional indemnity insurers in order to
settle the matter.
 In my view, none of this evidence was undermined by Mr
Hoare's cross-examination.
<P>

57   	In my view, it was clearly appropriate in the
circumstances for Cleary &amp; Hoare, in reliance on their legal advice, to
enter into the Second Settlement Agreement.  Further, the unchallenged evidence
of Ms FitzHenry shows that the Second Settlement
Agreement was negotiated at
arms length.
<P>

58   	To my mind, it is again strictly not necessary to go
further and to deal with the Trustees' additional and alternative estoppel
and
representational cases.  The estoppel case put by the Trustees was that the
insurers' breached their duty of utmost good faith
to Cleary &amp; Hoare in
that the insurers represented to Cleary &amp; Hoare that the year 3 policies
would not respond to their
claim for indemnity even though Cleary &amp; Hoare
are said to have notified the insurers of the Trustees' claims during year 3.
Accordingly, on the Trustees' case, the Insurers are estopped from asserting
that the subsequent assignment was in breach of Cleary
&amp; Hoare's duty of
utmost good faith.
<P>

59   	The representational case put by the Trustees is only
pressed should the Trustees fail to receive the benefit of the assignment
by
reason of the insurers' good faith claims being upheld.  That representational
case was to the effect that the insurers represented
to the Trustees that the
Trustees' claims against Cleary &amp; Hoare (or circumstances likely to give
rise to the Trustees' claims)
were notified by Cleary &amp; Hoare to its
insurers in August 1990 and that the year 3 policies could not respond to the
Trustees'
claims.  The Trustees then say that in fact, the insurers knew that
the August 1990 notification related to criminal charges brought
against Messrs
Scanlan and Cleary and did not disclose the Trustees' claims or circumstances
likely to give rise to the Trustees'
claims.  The case is that it was not until
November 1991 that Cleary &amp; Hoare notified the insurers of a civil claim
against them
and that it was not until 5 May 1992 that Cleary &amp; Hoare
notified the insurers of the Trustees' claims.  The insurers, on the
Trustees'
submissions, did not at any time prior to the making of the First Settlement
Agreement, correct their representation or
inform the Trustees of the
notification - claim - of 5 May 1992.
<P>

60   	The Trustees claim that in reliance upon these
representations which are said to have been misleading and deceptive, they
entered into the First Settlement Agreement.  Hence, the Trustees claim that if
as a result they are unable to obtain the benefit
of Cleary &amp; Hoare's
interest in the obligations of the insurers under the year 3 policies, the
Trustees will suffer loss and
damage and are entitled to succeed in their
cross-claim against the Insurers.
<P>

61   	In this regard, cross-examination of Mr Connor and Mr
Murphy took place.  To my mind, Mr Connor and Mr Murphy are shown to
have been
witnesses whose evidence was reliable in this area.
<P>

62   	I note that it was put to Mr Connor in cross-examination
that it was imprudent of him in late 1994 to assume that the 7 August
1990
notification necessarily was of the same circumstances which ultimately gave
rise to the claim.  Mr Connor did not agree with
this.  The proposition
involves Mr Connor being expected to disbelieve the unequivocal statements in
Coltman's letters of 8 August
1994 and 12 December 1994 in circumstances where
nothing was said thereafter to negate or qualify those statements.
<P>

63   	I note further that Mr Murphy in cross-examination was
shown a letter from Law Claims to Cleary &amp; Hoare of 29 November
1991.  That
letter included the following:
<P>

<i>`I refer to your letter of notification of 21 November 1991 of a possible
claim and advise that I have notified the Insurers accordingly.
 You will
appreciate that, until the Insurers receive and consider a full report from me,
all investigations and enquiries by Law
Claims must be without prejudice to the
rights of the Insurers.'</i>
<P>

64   	Mr Murphy's evidence was that had he known of the matters
set out in that letter prior to 1998, he would have insisted upon
an assignment
of the rights in relation to the year 3 policies.
<P>

65   	I accept as correct the Trustees' submission that on the
evidence there was no compelling reason for Baker &amp; McKenzie
to provide a
copy of that letter to the Trustees, because in the light of the Coltman's
letters of 8 August 1994 and 8 December 1994
(the latter enclosing the 29
November 1991 letter), the solicitors for the insurers were stating as an
unqualified fact that the
claims the subject of the Trustees' proceedings were
notified in August 1990.  To my mind, the Trustees' submission which should
be
accepted, is that the fact that the Trustees were also notified in November
1991, could not alter the position if in fact the
claims had already been
notified in August 1990.
<P>

66   	I deal with the question of costs of the good faith
proceedings below.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

67   	Both parties have addressed detailed submissions in
relation to costs.
<P>

68   	The insurers seek an order for costs in the main
proceedings and an order that those costs be on an indemnity basis in respect
of the various defendants from various dates between 2 March 1999 and 29 July
1999, being dates fixed by reference to Schedule 1
to the insurers' written
submissions, which in turn identifies a number of<i> Calderbank</i> letters and
details a number of settlements.  Annexure `A' to the affidavit of Ms T.M.
Hobson provides details.  On the basis that
the Court would not be disposed to
proceed to determine the good faith proceedings, the insurers seek an order for
costs in relation
to the good faith proceedings and an order that those costs
be on an indemnity basis, either from their inception or from 15 February
1999.
<P>

69   	The Trustees assert that the appropriate orders are that
the Trustees pay the insurers' costs of the main proceedings on a
party/party
basis and that the insurers as cross-claimants in those proceedings, pay to the
Trustees as cross-defendants in those
proceedings, costs of the cross-claim on
a party/party basis.  As to the good faith proceedings, the Trustees claim that
if the Court
be not disposed to proceed to determine the good faith
proceedings, the appropriate order is for the insurers who were the plaintiffs
in those proceedings to pay to the Trustees who were the defendants in those
proceedings, their costs on a party/party basis.  The
Trustees submit that if
the Court is disposed to proceed to determine the good faith proceedings, then
the costs of these proceedings
should abide the result.
<P>

70   	It is clearly unnecessary in a judgment relating to costs
to repeat matters to be found in the reserved judgment.  That judgment
serves
to identify the issues and the findings and the reasons for those findings.
<P>

71   	Both parties addressed detailed submissions in relation to
the reasons which caused the good faith proceedings to be commenced
and in
relation to their respective approaches to the appropriate costs orders.  To my
mind, it is first appropriate to look at the
main proceedings.  Before turning
to those proceedings, it is appropriate to recall the general principles which
obtain in relation
to costs.
<P>

72   	Costs are dealt with in section 76 of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></i>.  Costs are in the discretion of the Court (section 76(1)(a)).  The
Court has full power to determine by whom and to what extent
costs are to be
paid (section 76(1)(b)).  Costs follow the event except where it appears to the
Court that some other order should
be made (Part 52A <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 11).</a>
<P>

73   	The Court may order costs to be assessed on the basis set
out in Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a></i> or on an
indemnity basis <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 76(1)(c)).</a>  The former basis is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 2</a> as being the `party and party basis'.
<P>

74   	Since the amendments to the costs rules contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
52A</a>, indemnity costs have been circumscribed by the `reasonableness' concept.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 37(b)</a> provides that where costs are payable on an indemnity basis
all costs shall be allowed (except to the extent that it appears that
they are
of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred).
<P>

75   	As such, the new rules which only provide for costs on a
party and party basis or on an indemnity basis do not recognise the
concept of
costs on a solicitor/client basis but the old concept of reasonableness
formerly imported into such solicitor/client costs
is now imported into the
concept of indemnity costs.
<P>

76   	The general principles which inform the Court's discretion
to order costs which must be exercised judicially, were referred
to in detail
by the High Court of Australia in <i>Oshlack v Richmond River Council</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20152%20ALR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 152 ALR 83.</a>  As McHugh J pointed out at paragraph 67 (page 101):
<P>

<i>`The expression the "usual order as to costs" embodies the important
principle that, subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful
party in
litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour.  The principle is
grounded in reasons of fairness and policy
and operates whether the successful
party is the plaintiff or the defendant.  Costs are not awarded to punish an
unsuccessful party.
 The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify
the successful party.  If the litigation had not been brought, or defended,
by
the unsuccessful party the successful party would not have incurred the expense
which it did.  As between the parties, fairness
dictates that the unsuccessful
party typically bears the liability for the costs of the unsuccessful
litigation.</i>
<P>

<i>As a matter of policy, one beneficial by-product of this compensatory
purpose may well be to instil in a party contemplating commencing,
or
defending, litigation a sober realisation of the potential financial expense
involved.   . . .'</i>
<P>

77   	In the joint judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ their
Honours stated at paragraph 44 (page 95) :
<P>

<i>`It may be true in a general sense that costs orders are not made to punish
an unsuccessful party.  However, in the particular circumstance
of a case
involving some relevant delinquency on the part of the unsuccessful party, an
order is made not for party and party costs
but for costs on a "solicitor and
client" basis or on an indemnity basis.'</i>
<P>

78   	Turning to the main proceedings, the insurers rely upon
their <i>Calderbank</i> offers which were not accepted.  As I have said, the
offers are set out in Schedule 1 appended to the insurers' written submissions,
although I accept the Trustees' submission that the initial letters of 2 March
1999 did not include offers of compromise.  The Court
has, of course, power to
order costs on an indemnity basis in the exercise of its discretion and
irrespective of whether an Offer
of Compromise or a <i>Calderbank</i> letter
has been furnished.
<P>

79   	The insurers further rely in support of their claim for
indemnity costs upon the submission that the claim under the third
policy year
is said to have had no real prospects of success.  The insurers further rely in
relation to their claim to indemnity
costs upon the fact that the year 3
insurers clearly stated their position in relation to indemnity costs following
the discharge
of injunctions in their favour by Hunter J on 15 February
1999.
<P>

80   	The judgment of Hunter J on 15 February 1999 was an
interlocutory judgment handed down in a fairly unusual situation, outlined
by
his Honour where his Honour dismissed the Trustees' claims for declaratory
relief as to their alleged entitlement to rectification,
released the Trustees
and Messrs Cleary &amp; Hoare from their undertakings to the Court not to enter
into any agreement having the
effect of assigning rights under the 1991
policies of insurance and granted the Trustees leave to amend the main
proceedings to add
claims under the 1991 insurance policies.  His Honour stated
at page 9 of the judgment:
<P>

<i>`As I have earlier stated, if in relation to the other matter raised by
Senior Counsel it proves that there is no substance when the
facts are adduced
in the proposed claim by the trustees under the third policy then that is a
matter that may be addressed in terms
of indemnity costs, an application which
would be fortified by the application by Senior Counsel today seeking, in
advance, such
an order.  At least that has the effect of recording a claim for
indemnity costs at this early stage.'</i>
<P>

81   	Clearly enough, counsel appearing for the insurers before
Hunter J, claimed that the claim under the third policy was doomed
on that
occasion and Hunter J recognised this as an early warning to be ultimately
taken into account should the insurers succeed
and the Trustees fail in
relation to the Trustees' claim under the third policy year.  This has now
occurred.  It has occurred in
my view, in circumstances in which the claim in
respect of the third policy year was commenced and continued in disregard of
known
facts.  I accept as correct the Insurers submission that the facts which
gave rise to the successful known claims circumstances defence
and to the
successful prior notification defence were known to the Trustees prior to their
decision to amend the proceedings and
to make a claim in respect of the third
policy year.  Those facts were that Mr Scanlan `clearly became aware during his
examination
on 19 June 1990 of circumstances which were capable of giving rise
to a claim of the nature of that later pursued by the Trustees
in the <i>Cleary
&amp; Hoare</i> proceedings no. 5870 of 1994 [reserved judgment page 152
paragraph 439).  Further, the Court found "The Trustees' recording of the
essence of the charge and the pleadings is essentially misleading in this
context.  The 7 August 1990 notification was, in my view,
a notification of the
circumstances which gave rise in due course to the civil proceedings" [judgment
page 158 paragraph 454].
<P>

82   	The judgment of Hunter J handed down on 15 February 1999,
includes the following:
<P>

<i>`Senior Counsel for the insurers has frankly informed the Court that the
real basis for his clients' opposition to the course being
followed by the
trustees is twofold, namely, that any claim under the third policy is
misconceived as under the terms of earlier
policies notice of circumstances
giving rise to the very claim that is sought to be made in respect of the third
policy was given
and, under the terms of those policies in respect of which the
notice was given, any claim thereafter made is deemed to be made from
the time
that such notice was given.'    </i>[page 5]
<P>

83   	The insurers make the point, as I accept, that this was a
very substantial case requiring considerable preparation.  They
point out that
the offer of most of the defendants was to pay money as well as foregoing
costs.  They point out that whilst the offer
of those year 3 insurers who were
not otherwise sued was for a dismissal with no order as to costs that did
involve a significant
compromise in litigation of this scale.  They point out
that the offer to forego all pre-offer costs was a significant compromise
on
the end result, that is that the Trustees pay both the pre and post-offer costs
and cite in this regard <i>Wilkinson &amp; Ors v Feldworth Financial Services
Pty Ltd</i> [unreported, Rolfe J, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 17 December
1998 at page 22].
<P>

84   	The Trustees point our that the <i>Calderbank</i> letters
were written from 23 July 1999 (17 days before the hearing) to 6 August 1999 (3
days before the hearing).  The Trustees point
out that the offers were open for
very limited periods of time ranging from 7 days (including week-ends) to parts
of a day.  A convenient
table setting out these periods of time is set out in
paragraph 4 of the Trustees' written submissions which records the duration
of
relevant offers from particular insurers as running from one day duration of
offer to a seven day duration of offer.  This table
must however be reconciled
with Annexure `A' to Ms Hobson's affidavit which details the first and second
rounds of counter offer.
<P>

85   	The Trustees also submit that no offer of compromise was
made under the <i>Supreme Court Rules </i>as an offer made under Part 22 must
remain open for at least 28 days [Part 22 Rule 3(2)].
<P>

86   	The Trustees submit that the evident purpose of this
requirement is to give the party to whom the offer is addressed, sufficient
time to consider it.  The Trustees submit that this is of particular
significance where, as is said to have been the case in these
proceedings, the
offers, with one possible exception, were made within 14 days preceding the
commencement of the hearing on 9 August
1999.
<P>

87   	The Trustees submit that the insurers, having not availed
themselves of the statutory regime laid down by Part 22, have failed
to explain
why they did not do so.  The Trustees' submission is that given that the
insurers <i>Calderbank</i> offers gave less - in fact, in all cases, much less
- than the 28 days required to be given under Part 22, and in circumstances
where
the <i>Calderbank</i> offers were made at a time when the Trustees must
have been known to be preparing for hearing, the Court should be slow, absent
some
proper explanation, to give the insurers an outcome that they could not
have obtained by following the statutory procedure.  This
is said to be
particularly so where most of the insurers who made offers were involved as
insurers for at least two and in many cases
three of the insurance years in
question.  The Trustees' submission which I accept, is that where this was the
case, analysis and
consideration of any offer of compromise involved not just
the year 3 issues but all issues in the proceedings.
<P>

88   	The Trustees accept in their submissions that the Court
may take into account a <i>Calderbank</i> offer when considering whether or not
a special order should be made in relation to costs but that a special order
for costs does
not follow automatically.  They point out that in <i>Multicon
Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal Airports Corporation</i> (1996) 138 ALR 425,
Rolfe J at 451 stated that' an order would usually be made in favour of the
successful offer or from the date
of the making of the offer'.  The Trustees
submit that that would only be where, in all the circumstances, the offer
allowed a reasonable
time - prima facie 28 days is suggested as a reasonable
time - for its acceptance.  The Trustees submit that where, as they suggest,
this did not occur, then either no special order for costs should be made or if
a special order is contemplated, it should date only
from the expiry of the
reasonable period - the Trustees submit that in this case the statutory
analogue suggests 28 days from the
making of the offers.  The submission is
then that this is such a small period of time that it does not justify making
any special
order.
<P>

89   	To my mind, the Trustees' submissions do not take into
account the strength of the insurers' position with regard to the strength
of
the insurers' claim in relation to Year 3 as outlined to Hunter J on 15
February 1999.  That statement of the insurers did relate
to the suggested
misconceived claim under the third year policy and was accepted as such by
Hunter J.  The Trustees then submit that,
to the extent that the insurers rely
on the alleged hopelessness of the claim against the year 3 policies as a
ground supporting
a special costs order, that could at the most support such an
order only in relation to the year 3 claims.  The alleged hopelessness
- even
if found - is said not to have any possibility of infecting the rest of the
claims.  The Trustees also claim that there was
a relatively minor amount of
time and work devoted exclusively to year 3 issues and refer to the difficulty
of isolating purely year
3 work and quantifying purely 3 costs and refer to the
commonality of issues across the whole of the claim.
<P>

90   	To my mind, the circumstances which obtain in terms of a
combination of the insurers' submissions to Hunter J and his Honour's
comments
in relation to the possibility of indemnity costs in the main proceedings
should the year 3 policy claim fail, the sending
of the <i>Calderbank</i>
letters although late and the circumstance that the facts which gave rise to
the successful known claim circumstances defence and
to the successful prior
notification defence, were known to the Trustees prior to their decision to
seek to amend the proceedings
and make a claim in respect of the third policy
year, together do warrant the making of an order for indemnity costs in respect
of
the various defendants from various dates between 2 March 1999 and 29 July
1999 but the appropriate order is to award only thirty
percent of such costs.
In short, I accede to the application by the insurers summarised in paragraph
1(b) of their written submissions
(as corrected in oral submissions) but only
to the extent of thirty percent of the costs which had been claimed on an
indemnity basis
over the relevant dates identified in that paragraph of the
insurers' submissions.  The balance of the insurers' costs of the main
proceedings are to be ordered as payable on a party party basis.
<P>

91   	The Court has now proceeded to determine the good faith
proceedings.  The Trustees have effectively succeeded in terms of
the substance
of the good faith proceedings.  They had no alternative but to defend those
proceedings.  But for the fact that the
good faith proceedings were essentially
defensive in character, the appropriate order would be for the insurers to pay
the Trustees'
costs of the good faith proceedings.  Some recognition requires
to be given to the fact that the insurers succeeded in the main proceedings.
Some recognition requires to be given to the reasonably discrete nature of the
factual and legal issues litigated in the good faith
proceedings.  In my view,
the appropriate order is for the insurers to pay two thirds of the Trustees'
costs of the good faith proceedings.
<P>

92   	As to the cross-claim in the main proceedings, the parties
are agreed that as the insurers failed on their cross-claim to
recover the
$500,000 paid in October 1997, the appropriate order is that the insurers
should pay the Trustees' costs of that cross-claim.
<P>

93   	Short minutes of order should be brought in to reflect
these reasons and to record the formal change in parties.
