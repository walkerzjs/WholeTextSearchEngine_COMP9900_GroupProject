<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>NEWMAN J</b>
<P>

<b><u>FRIDAY, 17 DECEMBER 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>10021/98  -  LANDER  v  TRIGGER</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  These proceedings were initially
started by way of a claim for possession for land being brought by the
plaintiff against the defendant.
The basis of the plaintiff's claim was that
the defendant had defaulted under a mortgage.
<P>

2   	The subject mortgage had originally been given by Mr and
Mrs Ralphs to the defendant but had been transferred to the present
plaintiff.
<P>

3   	In his defence the defendant relied upon s 7 of the
<b>Contracts Review Act</b> and unconscionability in relation to the original
mortgage.
<P>

4   	Furthermore the defendant then issued cross-claims against
the original mortgagee, Mr and Mrs Ralphs, and a second cross-claim
on the
basis of professional negligence against a solicitor, Mrs Karageorge whom he
had seen in relation to the original mortgage.
<P>

5   	The reason why the defendant was seeking a loan in about
September 1995 was that he wished to undertake a business venture
with an
acquaintance of his named, Peter O'Shea.
<P>

6   	The business venture was to involve the pair using a truck
owned by O'Shea to go into the country and to collect bush rocks.
Those rocks
would then be sold to nurseries and others who would wish to use rocks of that
type for garden decoration.
<P>

7   	At the time when O'Shea and the defendant agreed to enter
into the venture, O'Shea's truck was in need of repair.
<P>

8   	One of the reasons why the defendant, who was an invalid
pensioner, desired to obtain loan funds was to have the truck repaired
so that
the venture could proceed.
<P>

9   	O'Shea suggested to the defendant that he should see a
mortgage broker, one Michael Moloney, to obtain a loan. This the defendant
did.
<P>

10   	Mr and Mrs Ralphs were clients of a firm of solicitors
known as Watson Tapsell. In particular Mr Albert Watkins of that firm
was known
to Mr Ralphs. Mr Ralphs had available the sum of $10,000 for investment
purposes and this fact was known to Mr Watkins.
<P>

11   	Apparently Mr Moloney was aware that Watkins Tapsell had
clients' funds available to lend on mortgage security.
<P>

12   	Having been contacted by the defendant he wrote to that
firm advising that his client wished to borrow $10,000 on first mortgage,
having enquired if Watkins Tapsell had a client who would be interested in
entering into such a transaction.
<P>

13   	Contact was obviously made by Watkins Tapsell with Moloney
advising that they did.
<P>

14   	Then followed a letter from Karageorge &amp; Co (the
second cross-defendant) to Watkins Tapsell giving title details and advising
that that firm acted for the defendant.
<P>

15   	The evidence indicates that the letter was probably
written as a result of the actions of a Ms McAusland who it seems, performed
secretarial work for both Moloney and Karageorge.
<P>

16   	Watkins Tapsell replied to that letter and forwarded
mortgage documents, requisitions on title and ancillary documents.
<P>

17   	There is no dispute that the defendant then saw Mrs
Karageorge. What then happened is a matter of considerable dispute.
<P>

18   	It was the defendant's contention that Mrs Karageorge
spent but five minutes with him and made a few elementary enquiries
of him. He
claims that he only wanted $3,000 and was unaware that the proposed loan was
for $10,000.
<P>

19   	On the other hand, Mrs Karageorge deposed that she spent
some twenty-five minutes with him and explained the salient features
relating
to the mortgage and his liabilities under the mortgage.
<P>

20   	The resolution of what happened at that meeting is a key
factual matter in these proceedings.
<P>

21   	In any event the matter proceeded in a normal fashion
resulting in the defendant executing an appropriate mortgage document.
Settlement of the mortgage took place on 28 September 1995 and funds were
disbursed.
<P>

22   	Out of the $10,000 the mortgagee's solicitor's costs, Mrs
Karageorge's costs and Moloney's fees together with disbursements
were
exacted.
<P>

23   	In the event the defendant received in his hand only about
$7,000.
<P>

24   	All, or a great part of that sum was passed by the
defendant to O'Shea. The basis of the agreement between O'Shea and the
defendant was that they would draw weekly amounts from the partnership funds
and ultimately divide the profits of the venture equally.
The venture, in fact,
did not get off the ground.
<P>

25   	The defendant got in touch with various persons to whom
the partnership wished to sell bush rock and as I understand his evidence
received favourable responses from those whom he contacted. Unfortunately,
O'Shea squandered the funds and no bush rocks were ever
collected.
<P>

26   	However, the defendant proceeded to make payments under
the mortgage to the Ralphs. A default occurred in June 1996. However,
in
response to a demand being made by Watkins Tapsell in relation to the arrears
the defendant not only made up the arrears, paid
a penalty for so doing but
also paid his July instalment in advance.
<P>

27   	Not surprisingly Mr Ralphs deposed that these actions
indicated that the defendant was a reliable person. I should add that
neither
Mr or Mrs Ralphs, Mr Watkins or Joan Lander had ever met the defendant until
after the commencement of these proceedings.
<P>

28   	In August 1996 Watkins Tapsell wrote to the defendant
asking whether he wished to repay the mortgage or renew it. The term
of the
mortgage I might add, was for one year.
<P>

29   	Mr Ralphs in August 1996 advised Mr Watkins that he no
longer wished to continue the mortgage and required the principal sum
to be
repaid to him.
<P>

30   	Mr Watkins, in turn, then contacted Joan Lander, another
client, and asked if she would take over the mortgage which she agreed
to
do.
<P>

31   	Prior to Mr Ralphs advising Mr Watkins that he no longer
wished to continue with the mortgage, the defendant had written to
Watkins
Tapsell advised that he wished to renew the loan. He repeated that request in a
letter sent in November.
<P>

32   	On 10 September 1996 Watkins Tapsell forwarded to the
defendant a letter enclosing a variation of mortgage, a new first mortgage,
and
ancillary documents. In the accompanying letter Watkins Tapsell told the
defendant as follows:
<P>

<i>"As these documents are to be signed before a solicitor, we should be
pleased if you could approach a local solicitor for this purpose."</i>
<P>

33   	In fact, the documents were signed before a person whose
address was the Court House, Kurri Kurri. However, nothing would
seem to turn
on the identity of that person. 
<P>

34   	There is nothing remarkable about any of the mortgage
documents whether they be the documents relating to the original loan
or to the
loan from the Ralphs or to the transfer of the security to Joan Lander.
<P>

35   	The variation of mortgage was registered at the Land
Titles Office on 30 September 1996. Mr Watkins forwarded the Ralphs a
cheque
for $10,000.
<P>

36   	The defendant continued to make payments under the
mortgage for approximately another year. He then defaulted in September
1997.
<P>

37   	In October 1997 the plaintiff served a notice pursuant to
s 57(2)(b) under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b> on the defendant.
<P>

38   	These proceedings were commenced on 7 January 1998. As I
have indicated above the matter which gives rise to the principal
factual
dispute in the matter was the contents of the first meeting between Mrs
Karageorge and the defendant.
<P>

39   	That meeting took place on 25 September 1995. In his
affidavit, the defendant deposed as to how that meeting came about and
the
contents of it. That part of his affidavit is as follows:
<P>

<i>"On 25 September 1995 I went to the offices of Diana Karageorge solicitor.
Peter came with me to Sydney. I was requested to see Diana
Karageorge by
Michael Moloney. I did not know Ms Karageorge before this day and had not heard
of Ms Karageorge before this day. Diana
Karageorge introduced herself. The
meeting with Diana Karageorge lasted no more than five minutes.</i>
<P>

<i>I said to Diana Karageorge:</i>
<P>

<i>`I am on a pension.'</i>
<P>

<i>Diana Karageorge said to me:</i>
<P>

<i>`You will be able to make the repayments easily. It's only twenty dollars a
week.'</i>
<P>

<i>Ms Karageorge did not read the documents to me.</i>
<P>

<i>Diana said:</i>
<P>

<i>`Do you understand what is in the documents.'</i>
<P>

<i>I said:</i>
<P>

<i>`I think I do.'</i>
<P>

<i>I signed the documents but did not understand what I was signing. I wanted
the money and wanted it all over and done with.</i>
<P>

<i>I was depressed and fearful at the time that I signed the documents. I
received no advice as to the legal and practical effects of
the loan documents.
Ms Karageorge never advised me that I would lose the house if I did not make
the repayments. I have had little
experience in reading legal
documents."</i>
<P>

40   	On the other hand as I have already noted, Mrs Karageorge
denied that this meeting was of such a desultory nature.
<P>

41   	Her evidence was that she explained to the defendant who
she was and why she was seeking him and she gave a full explanation
of the
liability which he would be undertaking should he enter into the mortgage
transaction.
<P>

42   	Not only that she claimed she discussed the question of
him obtaining long term finance at the completion of the term of the
loan.
<P>

43   	Not only did she deny the contents of the alleged
conversation deposed to by the defendant but she stated that she believed
he
was a truck driver. File notes which she kept at the time are confirmatory of
that evidence.
<P>

44   	In support of the defendant's claim as to his
understanding of the original transaction, a report from a Dr Rickarby,
psychiatrist,
was tendered in evidence. Dr Rickarby certifies that the
defendant in fact, is suffering from schizophrenia, major depression and
alcohol dependant disorder. He comes to certain conclusions which are dependent
upon the history he had been given.
<P>

45   	While I have no reason to doubt Dr Rickarby's diagnosis,
the conclusions he draws are as a result of all histories which he
received
which in fact differ from the factual findings which I am about to make.
Accordingly, I do not find his evidence of assistance
to the defendant.
<P>

46   	In the light of the defendant's actions following the
completion of the original mortgage transaction which as I have said,
included
not only making repayments on time but when in default, correcting that default
in accordance with the conditions of the
mortgage and his understanding as
evidenced by his letters in August and September 1996 to Watkins Tapsell of the
need for him to
renew the mortgage, I am of the view that in fact as Mrs
Karageorge did advise him thoroughly as to his liabilities under the mortgage
as she deposed she did I thus accept her evidence in the matter in preference
to that of the defendant wherever their testimony is
in conflict.
<P>

47   	It follows that I am of the view that the defendant was
well aware that the mortgage sum was $10,000 and that he was fully
aware of his
liabilities and responsibility under that mortgage.
<P>

48   	He was seeking a loan for a business purpose.
Unfortunately that business collapsed through no fault of his own or for that
matter any of the other parties to this litigation. It collapsed because of the
conduct of his prospective partner, Mr O'Shea.
<P>

49   	It may well be that his introduction to Mrs Karageorge was
unconventional. However, as I have said, I am satisfied that she
did tender
appropriate advice to him and as I have said subsequent actions confirm that he
understood that advice.
<P>

50   	Accordingly, there is nothing about that transaction which
was unconscionable. Thus, in so far as unconscionability is concerned
the
defendant has failed to make out his case in that regard.
<P>

51   	He also relies upon s 7 of the <b>Contracts Review Act</b>
1980.
<P>

52   	Section 6(2) of the <b>Contracts Review Act</b> is in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>"A person may not be granted relief under this Act in relation to a contract
so far as the contract was entered into in the course
of or for the purpose of
a trade, business or profession carried on by the person or proposed to be
carried on by the person, other
than a farming undertaking (including, but not
limited to, an agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, orcharding or
viticultural undertaking)
carried on by the person or proposed to be carried on
by the person wholly or principally in New South Wales."</i>
<P>

53   	In <b>Ellison v Vukicevic</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%207%20NSWLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 7 NSWLR 104</a>, Young J
decided that a contract to grant a mining lease was for the purpose of a
"trade, business or profession". He cited, with
approval, an unreported
judgment, 11 May 1984 of Lee J <b>Collings v Parker</b> where Lee J said:
<P>

<i>"The expression `for the purpose of' has the meaning that the contract under
consideration is entered into as an ordinary incident
of the carrying on of a
particular trade, business or profession then being carried on or proposed to
be carried on."</i>
<P>

54   	His decision was cited with approval by Toohey and Gaudron
JJ in <b>Wallis v Downard-Pickford (North Queensland) Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179
CLR 388</a> at 400.
<P>

55   	Because the purpose of the defendant seeking to borrow
money was for the purpose of entering into a partnership to obtain
and sell
bush rocks, I am of the view that s 6(2) applies and that thus the defendant is
precluded from obtaining relief under the
<b>Contracts Review Act</b>.
<P>

56   	It follows that in relation to the first transaction the
defendant has failed to make out his case.
<P>

57   	The consequence of this is that his cross-claim against
the Ralphs must fail in view of my findings as to the appropriate
nature of the
advice tendered by Mrs Karageorge to him. His claim against her for
professional negligence must also fail.
<P>

58   	In relation to the second transaction, Joan Lander has the
benefit of s 42 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b>. Section 42, relevantly, is in
the following terms.
<P>

<i>"42.(1)	Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or
interest which but for this Act might be held to be paramount
or to have
priority, the registered proprietor for the time being of any estate or
interest in land recorded in a folio of the Register
shall, except in case of
fraud, hold the same, subject to such other estates and interests and such
entries, if any, as are recorded
in that folio, but absolutely free from all
other estates and interests that are not so recorded except:</i>
<P>

<i>(a number of exceptions which do not apply to this are then
mentioned.)</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	In subsection (1), a reference to an estate or interest in land recorded
in a folio of the Register includes a reference to an
estate or interest
recorded in a registered mortgage, charge or lease that may be directly or
indirectly identified from a distinctive
reference in that folio."</i>
<P>

59   	It follows that in any event, s 42 stands in the way of
the defendant obtaining the relief he seeks by way of defence to her
claim.
<P>

60   	I should add that I see nothing untoward in the manner in
which the variation of mortgage was carried out by Joan Lander's
solicitors. As
far as they were aware, the defendant had been advised by Mrs Karageorge as to
his rights and liabilities under the
original mortgage. As I have found that
confidence was not misplaced.
<P>

61   	While Watkins Tapsell did not specifically tell the
defendant to seek advice from a solicitor they told him to go and see
one in
order to have the documents executed. They, of course, were not aware that the
defendant was suffering from any psychiatric
malady.
<P>

62   	However, s 42 in any event makes Joan Lander's title
indefeasible. Accordingly, the defence cannot succeed as against her
claim.
<P>

63   	Accordingly it follows that the plaintiff must succeed in
her claim for possession and that the defendant's cross-claims against
the
Ralphs and Mrs Karageorge must fail.
<P>

64   	Accordingly there will be judgment for possession for the
plaintiff and judgment for the cross-defendants on the cross-claims.
<P>

65   	I shall defer the entering of judgment until delivery of
these reasons so that the amounts of debt owed by the defendant to
the
plaintiff may be calculated.
<P>

66   	I shall also defer making any costs orders until delivery
of these reasons.
