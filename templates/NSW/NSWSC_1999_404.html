<b><u>21262/95  -  JOHN TINGLE &amp; ANOR  v  HARBOUR RADIO PTY LTD &amp; ANOR
[No 1]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT  (Re question of playing tape in front of jury - see p 33 of
transcript)</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In the course of an action for defamation brought by John
Tingle against a company responsible for the radio station 2GB, an issue
arose
as to whether it was permissible for the plaintiff, or indeed either party, to
play the tape which contains the matter complained
of more than once.
<P>

2	Mr McClintock, who appears with Mr Lancaster on behalf of the defendants,
says that the tapes should be played only the once.
 He make this submission on
the basis that the ordinary reasonable listener may be taken to have heard the
tapes but once, and to
have formed an impression upon that basis.
<P>

3	I have had the advantage of reading the decision of Levine J in<b> <i>Marsden
v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd</i></b> (unreported, 18 February
1999), where his Honour deals with a similar issue which arose in the context
of that case.  I have also
had the opportunity of examining the judgment of his
Honour Dunford J in<b> <i>Goldsworthy v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd</i></b>
(unreported, 22 March 1999.)
<P>

4	It was argued by the defendant that neither decision should be followed.
Although the test was the reaction of the hypothetical
reasonable listener, it
would be unreal to image that the jurors could ever divorce their own reaction,
and place themselves in the
shoes of the hypothetical listener.  Inevitably the
jurors are guided by their own reaction.  It is wrong to approach the issue
upon
any other basis.  It is illogical, in the defendants' submission, to place
the jurors in a position which is utterly different from
that which may have
been experienced by the ordinary reasonable listener, by exposing the jurors to
the repeated playing of the broadcast.
<P>

5	Although there is some force in these arguments, I prefer the reasoning of
Levine J and Dunford J.  Given that counsel has the
right to address the jury
before they retire, and given that the understanding of each juror will be
supplemented by that of other
jurors before any questions are answered, it is
impossible to re-create, in the context of the courtroom, the circumstances in
which
the ordinary reasonable listener may have experienced the words said.  To
attempt to do so is to distract the jurors from the test
which they must apply,
namely an objective test based upon the ordinary reasonable listener.
<P>

6	In <b><i>Marsden</i></b>, counsel for the defendant asserted that the tape
should not be marked, and should not be available to the jury, to be played and
replayed.  In this matter, Counsel for the defendants did not go that far.  He
acknowledged the inevitability of the jury having
the tape of the broadcast
when they retire.  Even were that concession not made, I believe that the jury
should have the broadcast
available.
<P>

7	The tape has now been played once.  Counsel may, if they wish, play it again
when addressing the jury on the issues which the
jury must now determine.
