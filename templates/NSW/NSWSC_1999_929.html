<b>50103//1999 - NOVACOAL AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED v MACQUARIE GENERATION</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff (or its predecessor) and the defendant (or
its predecessor) have been in a contractual relationship for the last
13 years
for the supply of coal from the plaintiff's Howick mine in the Hunter Valley to
the defendant's Liddell and Bayswater Power
Stations, also in the Hunter Valley
and in close proximity to the Howick mine.  The term of the current contract
between the parties
is until 2010.
<P>

2   	This is an application by the plaintiff for injunctive
relief in respect of the defendant's conduct on 24 August 1999 when
it
suspended delivery of coal from the plaintiff because it was claimed to be
outside certain specifications contained in the contract.
 The injunction the
plaintiff seeks is in the following terms:
<P>

That until further order Macquarie Generation cease the suspension of
deliveries of coal by Novacoal which it commenced on 24 August,
1999.
<P>

3   	The matter was heard on 3 and 9 September 1999 when Mr T.F.
Bathurst QC, leading Mr P.W. Collinson of counsel, appeared for
the plaintiff
and Mr B.W. Walker SC (3.9.99 only), leading Mr I.M. Jackman of counsel and Mr
M.J. Leeming of counsel, appeared for
the defendant.
<P>

<b>Contractual History</b>
<P>

4   	BP Coal Development Australia Pty Limited, since renamed
Novacoal Australia Pty Limited, originally agreed to supply coal to
the
defendant's predecessor, the Electricity Commission of New South Wales,
pursuant to a contract apparently numbered 3726 from
1 July 1986 and from July
1987 to December 1990 under Contract 3806B.  
<P>

5   	In March 1989 the Electricity Commission issued tender 4007
which was subsequently won by the plaintiff.  The contract 3806B
was then
combined with tender 4007 to create the current contract referred to as the
3806B variation (3806BV).  3806BV was signed
on 20 July 1990 and took effect
from 1 January 1991 for the term which expires on 31 December 2010.  It
provides for the delivery
of 2.5 million tonnes of coal per annum plus or minus
20%.  The price paid for the coal by the defendant, subject to contractual
adjustments, is approximately $1.48 per gigajoule.
<P>

6   	Between August 1997 and December 1997 an interim agreement
operated between the parties for the supply of coal at an increased
ash level
with supply based upon an energy (or gigajoule) basis rather than a volume
basis at a price of $1.38 per gigajoule.
<P>

7   	A second interim agreement operated during 1998 for the
supply of coal with an energy content of 56 million gigajoules comprising
46
million gigajoules at $1.38 per gigajoule and 10 million gigajoules at $1 per
gigajoule.  This resulted in the delivery of 2.6
million tonnes during 1998.
<P>

8   	The defendant sought a further interim agreement for 1999
to enable it to purchase coal at $1.20 per gigajoule.  The plaintiff
did not
agree to that price and in those circumstances the parties reverted to 3806BV
from 1 January 1999 pursuant to which the defendant
is required to pay the
higher price for the coal than that paid pursuant to the interim agreements.
<P>

<b>Characteristics of Coal </b>
<P>

9   	One of the characteristics of coal is what is known as
grindability. Grindability is a measure of the difficulty of grinding
coal for
use as pulverised fuel.  Various techniques have been used to measure the work
required to crush coal one of which was developed
by a person named Hardgrove.
This became known as the Hardgrove Grindability Index or HGI.
<P>

10   	High HGI values indicate that less work is required to
crush the coal.  Thus coal with low HGI values will require more work
and more
wear and tear on the mill to crush the coal.
<P>

11   	Other relevant attributes of coal in this case are what
have been referred to as gross specific energy, total moisture content
and ash
content.  These qualities are determined daily and the price is based upon
these daily results.
<P>

12   	The original contract 3806B and the tender document 4007
both referred to a lower limit for HGI at 44 with no upper limit.
 3806BV
refers to an HGI range of 54 - 44 or alternatively 48 - 60.  The ranges for
gross specific energy are 21.0 - 27.0 or alternatively
23 - 26.  The ranges for
the percentage of total moisture content are 10 maximum or alternatively 8 - 10
and the ranges for the percentage
of ash content are 18 - 25 or alternatively
16 - 23.  (cl 3.1.1/Schedule M1).  There is controversy between the parties as
to whether
the ranges referred to in the alternative (those in Schedule M1) are
applicable.
<P>

13   	These ranges are referred to as the Standard Coal Quality
(cl 7.16.1) and if the plaintiff delivers coal outside any of the
ranges the
defendant has a discretion to accept it and apply penalty provisions to the
price it pays for the coal. Those penalty
provisions contain formulae for
adjustments known as the Specific Energy Adjustment, the Ash Content Adjustment
and the Excess Moisture
Adjustment.
<P>

14   	The intention of the Specific Energy Adjustment "is to pay
for coal on an energy basis".(cl7.16.2)  The intention of the Ash
Content
Adjustment is to reflect the cost to the defendant due to the effect of "ash on
its boilers and associated equipment"(cl
7.16.3).  The intention of the Excess
Moisture Adjustment is to reflect the cost to the defendant "for loss of
pulverising mill capacity
and other inefficiencies in power station performance
due to excess moisture content" (cl 7.16.4).
<P>

15   	If the defendant does not exercise its discretion to
accept the coal that is outside the specified ranges, it may reject it
by
suspending deliveries which it is entitled to continue until it is satisfied
with the plaintiff's proposal that the coal to be
delivered in the future will
be within the specified ranges (cl 3.4).
<P>

<b>Terms of the contract</b>
<P>

16   	Although the terms of the contract relevant to this
application are somewhat lengthy I am of the view that it is appropriate
to
extract them hereunder:
<P>

3.1<i>	</i><u>COAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</u>
<P>

3.1.1.	All coal shall be delivered to the nominated Delivery Point and shall
possess characteristics within the following ranges:
<P>

	Gross Specific Energy (MJ/kg)	
<P>

	(at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=8%20TM%29%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">8% T.M.)				21.0</a> - 27.0
<P>

<P>

	Total Sulphur Content (%)		
<P>

	(at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=8%20TM%29%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">8% T.M.)				1.0</a> maximum
<P>

	Chlorine Content (%)			0.02 - 0.08
<P>

<P>

	Fines (minus 1.0 mm)			 15% maximum						         
<P>

	Ash Resistivity - ohm. Cm at 120C	5 x 10 13 maximum	
<P>

Ash Analysis
<P>

Si02					45 - 75
<P>

A1203					15 - 35
<P>

Fe203					 1 - 12
<P>

Ti02					 0.4 - 2.2
<P>

Mn 304				 0.1 - 0.7
<P>

Ca0					0.1 - 2.3
<P>

Mg0					 0.2 - 1.4
<P>

Na20					0.1 - 0.9
<P>

K20					0.8 - 2.6
<P>

P205					0.1 - 1.6
<P>

S03					0.1 - 1.5
<P>

The Contractor is required to give, in Schedule M1, the values of the above
characteristics that would be considered representative
of the coal supply he
is offering.
<P>

3.1.2	The Standard Coal Quality requirement on which the Tenderer is deemed to
have tendered will be:
<P>

	Total Moisture (as received)		 8.0%
<P>

	Ash (as received)			22.0 %
<P>

	Specific Energy (as received)		23.0%
<P>

(i.e. it will be assumed in tender assessment that Tenderers have converted the
"price" for the quality of coal to be supplied -
see Schedule M1 - to an
equivalent price for standard quality coal).
<P>

3.1.3	The Contractor shall nominate the specific quality characteristics for
the coal to be supplied in Schedule M1.  All costs
associated with the mining,
washing, blending, handling and transport of the coal to the Delivery Point
shall be met by the Contractor.
<P>

3.1.4	The quality parameters set down in Clause 3.1.1. are based upon the
design limitations of the power station boilers.  The
Contract imposes price
adjustments based on the average monthly quality of the coal supplied.
<P>

3.2	<u>COAL QUALITY DETERMINATION</u>
<P>

3.2.1	The daily results of coal quality obtained by automatic mechanical
sampling will be used for the purposes of calculating adjustments
to the
Contract Price per Tonne for variations in ash content, specific energy and
moisture content.
<P>

Either party to the Contract will be entitled to any reasonable inspection or
check of all weighing, on-line monitoring, sampling
and testing facilities, and
shall have or provide reasonable access for witnessing weighing, on-line
monitoring, sampling and analysis
of the coal.
<P>

3.2.2	For the purpose of coal quality determination, it is proposed that the
coal as received at Bayswater Power Station, shall
be sampled on each Delivery
Day by the Principal or an independent authority engaged by the Principal at
the sampler located on the
H1 conveyor, generally in accordance with the
following standards:
<P>

AS1038 Parts 1, 3, 5, 14, 16 - "Methods for Analysis and Testing of Coal and
Coke"
<P>

AS2646 - 1984 - "Sampling of Solid Mineral Fuels" including "Draft Amendment to
Part 2, 1988"
<P>

BS1016 Part 17:1979 - "Method for the Analysis and Testing of Coal and Coke -
Size Analysis of Coal".
<P>

AS1152-1973 - "Test Sieves".
<P>

The Lot as referred to in Clause 3.9 of AS2646 Part 2 is deemed to consist of
the quantity of coal delivered by the Contractor in
one month.  The daily
samples will be treated as sampling units as defined on AS2646 Part 2 -
1984.
<P>

3.2.3	The Contractor has no objection to an automatic mechanical sampler being
established on the mine site by an independent authority
which will operate and
maintain it in accordance with the Australian Standard for coal sampling from
moving belts, all at the Principal's
cost.
<P>

It is acknowledged that the location of the sampler at Howick in lieu of the H1
conveyor will cause the Contractor to incur coal
quality penalties not
envisaged by the Contract.  In the event that the sampler is placed at Howick
and the belt weigher remains
at Bayswater, the parties shall analyse the effect
of that arrangement on the coal quality formulae and make alterations to the
formulae
to ensure that the payments to the Contractor remain as envisaged by
the Contract.
<P>

3.2.4	During the life of the Contract, sampler maintenance and sample
collection and analysis will be carried out by the Principal
or an independent
Authority engaged by the Principal.  All costs for performing the services of
sample maintenance and sample collection
and analysis, and preparation and
distribution of analysis reports, will be borne by the Principal.
<P>

3.2.5	Three portions of each sample will be prepared.  One portion will be used
by the Principal for routine analysis, one delivered
to the Contractor as a
check sample and one will be held in reserve for Umpire Analysis.  The Umpire
Analysis sample will be disposed
of after three months unless subject to claim.
The Principal will promptly notify the Contractor of the results of the
analysis in
respect of each sample.  Notification of results of sample analysis
for moisture, ash and specific energy to the Contractor shall
be not later than
the third Contract Working Day after the relevant day upon the Principal to
provide the analysis shall result in
no penalties being borne by the Contractor
on that day's coal deliveries.  However, where quality results are forwarded
late by the
Power Station, and a net bonus is due, the results shall apply and
the appropriate bonus shall be paid.
<P>

3.2.6	The coal characteristics to be determined shall include total moisture,
ash content and specific energy and other properties
as appropriate.
<P>

3.2.7	The Contractor shall have the right to cause his representative to attend
and observe the determination of coal quality. 

<P>

3.2.8	In the event of a disagreement by the Contractor regarding the
determination of coal quality properties, excepting as received
total moisture
content, he shall advise the Principal in writing within three working days of
the date of notification of the sample
analysis result.  If deemed necessary
the Umpire Sample shall then be made available to an independent laboratory for
a check analysis,
with the costs incurred to be borne by the Contractor.  In
the event that this further quality determination differs by more than
the
normal limits of repeatability from the original analysis, the umpire analysis
results shall be substituted as the deemed coal
quality for the purposes of the
Contract, and the Principal shall reimburse the Contractor the costs of the
testing and of the coal
at the deemed coal quality.
<P>

3.3	<u>COAL HANDLEABILITY DETERMINATION</u>
<P>

3.3.1	The coal delivered by the Contractor on any day shall have handleability
characteristics within the limits set out in this
Clause.
<P>

3.3.2	It is the Principal's intention to establish a relationship between coal
which causes handleability problems in the coal handling
plant at the power
stations and a suitable control test(s).
<P>

3.3.3	The Contractor shall co-operate fully in the development of these test(s)
and calibration procedures to enable appropriate
standards to be established at
the earliest practicable time.
<P>

3.3.4	Until such time as the control test/handleability relationship has been
established, the Principal will measure handleability
by means of the flow
factor as determined by the Jenike Shear Test with minimum acceptable values as
noted in Clause 3.3.5.
<P>

3.3.5	The coal handling plant in the power stations has been designed to accept
coal with minimum flow factors, as determined by
the Jenike Shear Test as
follows: 
<P>

At a consolidation pressure of 7.5 kPa flow factor = 3.2
<P>

			(SAMPLE ONLY)
<P>

At a consolidation pressure of 15.0 kPa flow factor = 3.9
<P>

			(SAMPLE ONLY)
<P>

3.3.6	Accordingly, the most stringent handleability criterion that would be
established is one which refers to a control test value
corresponding to the
above minimum flow factors.
<P>

3.3.7	Whilst the above set out the proposed technical criterion for rejecting
coal on a handleability basis, it is emphasised that
no coal will be rejected
on this basis unless, in addition to failing the handleability criterion, it
also causes the Principal handleability
problems in the coal handling plant.

<P>

<u>3.4	COAL REJECTION</u>
<P>

3.4.1	The Principal shall have the right to reject (by suspending deliveries)
coal with characteristics outside the ranges set down
in Clause 3.1.1 averaged
over one full day.
<P>

3.4.2	The Principal shall also have the right to immediately reject coal (by
suspending deliveries and/or non-payment for coal delivered)
contaminated with
foreign material including but not limited to such items as wood, metal,
rubber, brattice, rock and glass;  or
coal containing oversize material;  or
coal which demonstratably blocks the Principal's conveyor system due to
excessive moisture
or fines.
<P>

3.4.3	In the event that the Principal suspends deliveries, pursuant to Clause
3.4.1 above, the Contractor will be required to promptly
demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Principal the steps to be taken within the mining and coal
preparation operation to restore
the quality of coal delivered to comply with
the abovementioned requirements.  The Principal will not initiate the delivery
of coal
onto its conveyor system until it is fully satisfied with the
Contractor's proposal.  Any reduction in the monthly Transfer Capacity
provided
by the Principal, as a result of exercising its rights under this Clause, shall
be considered as being due to a failure
to deliver coal on the part of the
Contractor.
<P>

4.3	<u>FAILURE OF CONTRACTOR TO SUPPLY COAL</u>
<P>

The Contractor's attention is particularly drawn to the General Conditions
(Default by Contractor) in regard to the rights of the
Principal to obtain from
alternative sources any shortfall below 90% of the relevant Coal Quota.
<P>

7.16	<u>PRICE ADJUSTMENT FOR COAL QUALITY</u>
<P>

7.16.1.2  If the coal quality on any Delivery Days in the month is outside the
ranges specified in Clause 3.1, the Principal reserves
its rights to deal with
the coal delivered on such days in accordance with Clause 3.4.  At the
Principal's discretion, however, it
will have the option of accepting such coal
but the penalty provisions set down hereunder shall apply.  
<P>

The Contract Price per tonne of coal for any month shall be varied to reflect
variations in specific energy, ash and moisture content
from the standard Coal
Quality (refer Clause 3.1).
<P>

<u>CLAUSE 8.41 - DEFAULT BY CONTRACTOR</u>
<P>

<u>8.41.1	Procedure on Default by Contractor</u>
<P>

If the Contractor defaults in the performance or observance of any covenant,
condition or stipulation contained in the Contract
or refuses or neglects to
comply with any direction given in writing by the Principal under the Contract
to the Contractor, the Principal
may call upon the Contractor, by notice in
writing, to show cause why the powers hereinafter contained in the Clause
should not be
exercised.  Such notice shall not be unreasonably given and must
state that it is a notice under the provisions of this clause and
must specify
the default, refusal or neglect on the part of the Contractor upon which it is
based, and shall specify the period (which
shall be not less than fourteen days
after service of notice) by which the Contractor is required to show cause as
aforesaid.  If
the Contractor fails within the period specified in the notice
in writing to show cause to the satisfaction of the Principal why
the power
hereinafter contained should not be exercised, the Principal, without prejudice
to any other rights that it may have under
the Contract against the Contractor,
may:
<P>

(a)	take the Work under the Contract wholly or partly out of the hands of the
Contractor or of any other person in whose hands or
possession any part of it
may be;  or
<P>

(b)	purchase and have delivered coal from alternative sources to make-up any
shortfall below 80% or Coal Quota and the Contractor
will be liable for any
additional cost incurred by the Principal in obtaining suitable make-up coal;
or
<P>

(c)	terminate the Contract.
<P>

8.41.2	<u>Preservation of Rights of Principal</u>
<P>

	No action taken by the Principal under Clause 8.41.1 shall vitiate the
Contract or operate to the prejudice of any other right
of the Principal under
the Contract or otherwise.
<P>

8.41.3	<u>Termination of Contract</u>
<P>

	If the Principal decides to terminate the Contract under Clause 8.41.1(c) it
may do so by giving notice in writing to the Contractor.
 If such notice is
posted to the Contractor it shall be sent by certified mail or recorded
delivery.  The termination shall be without
prejudice to any right that may
have accrued to the Principal or to the Contractor under the contract.
<P>

<u>SCHEDULE M1</u>
<P>

After setting out the alternative ranges including those to which reference has
been made in paragraph 12 of this judgment the Schedule
states:
<P>

<u>Note</u>	Coal quality is to comply with quality requirements of Clause 3 and
be derived from Schedules.
<P>

<b>H1 Sampler</b>
<P>

17   	The Sampler located on the HI conveyor, referred to in cl
3.2.2, is the subject of controversy between the parties.  Since
the failure of
the parties to reach agreement in respect of a lower price for coal the
defendant has suspended coal deliveries on
a number of occasions during 1999
and is a topic to which I shall return.  One of the stated reasons for the
suspensions and importantly
the suspension the subject of this application, has
been the HGI results from testing at the H1 Sampler.  The plaintiff challenges
the reliability and accuracy of the test results from the H1 Sampler.
<P>

18   	Although coal has been supplied for 8 years under 3806BV
the plaintiff has not had cause to question the HGI readings as there
has not
been any complaint by the defendant to the plaintiff about them.  Indeed the
evidence is that the monthly tests of HGI during
the period January 1991 to
January 1999 showed readings consistently at the top of or above the HGI range
in cl 3.1.1 or Schedule
M1 of 3806BV.  The first time the HGI readings were the
subject of complaint was May 1999.
<P>

19   	In 1995 ACIRL, a firm of consultants specialising in coal
research, was employed by the defendant to carry out an audit and
bias test of
the H1 Sampler.  An initial audit was completed in May 1995 when several
non-conformities with the Australian Standard
4264.1 - 1995 "Higher Rank coal -
sampling procedures" were identified.  Those non -conformities were: 
<P>

&#183;	the primary cutter bucket was overloaded;
<P>

&#183;	the primary cutter aperture was undersized;
<P>

&#183;	the primary cutter lips were not defined;
<P>

&#183;	the smoothing conveyor was losing coal off the sides prior to the
crusher; and
<P>

&#183;	the slotted belt cutter lips were not defined.
<P>

20   	Although these non-conformities were identified in the May
audit they had not been addressed at the time the bias sampling
was conducted
which commenced in June 1995 and continued over several visits.
<P>

21   	In its final report delivered to the defendant in 1995
ACIRL noted the fact that the non-conformities had not been addressed
and in
referring to the fact that there had been an insufficient sample population
stated:
<P>

There is a degree of probability that larger particles are not representatively
sampled; that is they do not have as much chance
of entering the cutter due to
the narrowness of the opening.
<P>

22   	The evidence from Mr Hall, the expert for the plaintiff
who was cross examined but not on this aspect, indicates that the
deficiency in
respect of the size of the aperture may cause the H1 sampler to produce
unreliable or inaccurate results by reason
of a preferential sampling of the
finer size fractions which are known to have higher moisture and HG1
results.
<P>

23   	Mr McMahon, an expert whose affidavit was read by the
defendant, proffered the opinion that the actual HGI results may be
higher than
those sampled by the H1 Sampler.  Whatever be the final conclusion reached on
the effect of the H1 Sampler's identified
non-conformities the irresistible
conclusion I have reached is that both experts recognise that the HGI readings
obtained from the
H1 Sampler lack reliability.
<P>

24   	The date of receipt of the ACIRL report by the plaintiff
is also the subject of some controversy.  It assumes some importance
in this
matter because it is relevant to the approach that has been adopted by the
plaintiff in the proceedings and in particular
in relation to an interim
agreement that was reached between the parties on 16 June 1999 after the
proceedings were commenced.  
<P>

25   	The defendant claims it provided a copy of the report to
the plaintiff soon after it received it in November 1995.  The plaintiff
claims
that it only received a copy of the report in about June 1999.  The defendant
was not in a position to provide any firm detail
as to the specific date upon
which it was said to have been delivered, nor was there any written record of
its delivery, nor was
there any identification of the person to whom it is
claimed it was delivered in late 1995.  
<P>

26   	Mr H.R Scott, the solicitor for the defendant, was cross
examined about this matter because it was his hearsay evidence that
was the
basis of the suggestion that the plaintiff had received the report in late
1995.  Paragraph 33 of his affidavit is in the
following terms:
<P>

I am informed by Ray Durie, the fuel supply officer at Macquarie's Bayswater
Power Station located in the Upper Hunter Valley (the
responsible Macquarie
employee administering the coal supply to the Power Station), and verily
believe that the ACIRL Report was
provided by Mr Durie to Novacoal shortly
after the meeting of 9 November 1995.
<P>

27   	In cross examination the following evidence was given;
<P>

Q.  Did Mr Durie tell you to whom he provided that report?
<P>

A.  No
<P>

Q.  Did he tell you whether it was provided under cover of a letter or not?
<P>

A.  He told me he was uncertain as to whether it was provided under cover of a
letter or whether it was handed direct to a person.
<P>

Q.  Did he tell you whether he handed it direct to a person or whether somebody
else handed it direct to a person?
<P>

A.  He said he could not himself recall personally handing it to a person, but
it was forwarded to Novacoal.
<P>

Q.  Did you ask him to search to see if there was any such letter?
<P>

A.  As a result of your question this morning - your intention expressed to
counsel this morning, that you were gong to cross examine
me on paragraph 33, I
did ask him at lunch time, and he said he would search his records and he has
not got back.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.  And he certainly has not got back to you when you asked him at lunch
time?
<P>

A.  No he hasn't.
<P>

Q.  Did you ask him to think a bit harder about who he might have given the
document to?
<P>

A.  Yes I did.
<P>

Q.  Did that produce any result?
<P>

A.  Only the response that he was certain that he handed it to someone , or
sent it by mail, to Novacoal, but he could not recall
the specific person.
<P>

28   	A call was then made upon the defendant to produce any
letter to Novacoal providing the ACIRL Report to it.  No letter has
been
produced.
<P>

29   	The plaintiff's evidence that it had only received the
report in June is in my view supported by the stance it adopted on
27 May 1999.
Had the report been to hand at that time one would have expected the 27 May
letter to be couched in different terms
to that in which it is couched.  The
plaintiff merely indicated that it was going to investigate the technique used
for the determination
of HGI.  If it had the report and had digested its
contents one would have expected the response that was certainly made
thereafter
that the H1 sampler did not confirm to the Australian Standard and
therefore the readings could not be relied upon.  In all the circumstances
 I
accept the plaintiff's evidence that it did not receive the report until June
of 1999.  
<P>

30   	During the course of this litigation the plaintiff has
requested the defendant to advise it whether any modifications have
been made
to the H1 Sampler since the date of the report and advised that it wished to
commission an independent expert to provide
a report on the H1 sampler.  It
also requested that no changes should be made to the Sampler at least before it
had been reviewed
by the plaintiff's expert.
<P>

31   	The defendant declined to provide the information sought
by the plaintiff and informed it that the matter would be determined
in the
course of the current litigation.
<P>

<b>16 June 1999 interim agreement</b>
<P>

32   	As will be seen from the summary the parties entered into
an interim agreement on 16 June 1999.  The circumstances surrounding
that
agreement have been the subject of evidence.  The defendant submits that it was
the intention of the parties in that agreement
that the plaintiff would supply
coal with HGI readings between 44 and 54.  The conversations deposed to by Mr
Scott with the plaintiff's
former counsel relied upon in support of that
submission were not the subject of any challenge. 
<P>

33   	Mr Bathurst QC submitted that such an agreement did not
include an agreement that such range would be determined by the H1
sampler.  He
submitted that the parties expressly agreed that it was without prejudice to
any rights accrued which included a right
to challenge the reliability of the
H1 Sampler.
<P>

<b>Suspension of deliveries</b>
<P>

34   	The contractual relationship between the parties in 1999
has become somewhat brittle and the defendant has exercised its rights
to
suspend deliveries of coal on a number of occasions during the year.  The
reasons for such suspensions have varied but the following
summarises the
history of those suspensions and/or notifications by the defendant that it has
reserved its rights in respect of deliveries
of coal said to be outside the
ranges required by 3806BV or alternatively the 16 June 1999 agreement:
<P>

26 February 1999	Deliveries were suspended under cl 3.4 "due to the quality of
coal currently being provided". Total moisture was
above the maximum of 10% and
there were chute blockages. The defendant notified the plaintiff that before it
would resume deliveries
it needed to be "satisfied that the handleability of
your coal has improved, and that the total moisture is below 10%".
<P>

1 March 1999		The plaintiff notified the defendant that the handleability
problems stemmed from a combination of wet weather and
poor quality coal
resulting from difficulties in mining a particular coal type.  The plaintiff
advised the defendant that it had
"put in place measures (which it described)
to ensure that further deliveries will be within specification" and requested
the defendant
to resume receiving coal.
<P>

2 March 1999		Deliveries resumed.
<P>

3 March 1999		The defendant suspended deliveries because "total moisture was
10.3%". It advised the plaintiff that deliveries would
be suspended until it
was satisfied the plaintiff had "taken steps to prevent further deliveries of
greater than 10%".  The plaintiff
advised the defendant that the coal was
within contract limits.
<P>

4 March 1999		The plaintiff advised the defendant that it was in a position to
provide coal within contract specifications. And
that it had put strategies in
place, including operational modifications to ensure ongoing compliance. The
plaintiff noted `with
some frustration the results of "yesterday's deliveries"
' and that "the total moisture was within contract limits, as we indicated
yesterday".
<P>

4 March 1999		Deliveries resumed.
<P>

30 March 1999	The defendant suspended deliveries because the total sulphur
content delivered on 29 March was greater than the 1%
maximum. The defendant
notified the plaintiff that the suspension was until it was satisfied that the
plaintiff had "taken steps
to prevent further deliveries with a sulphur content
in excess of 1%".
<P>

30 March 1999	The plaintiff advised the defendant that the reading above 1% was
an anomaly "as the shift analysis" did not reflect
such a reading but advised
that it had nevertheless refined its quality control strategy which it
described and requested resumption
of deliveries.
<P>

30 March 1999	Deliveries resumed.
<P>

7 April 1999		The defendant suspended deliveries because a chute was blocked
and advised the plaintiff that the total moisture content
was 10.3%.  It
advised that it would not resume deliveries until it was satisfied that "the
coal will not cause further chute blockages,
and the moisture level will not be
greater than 10%".
<P>

8 April 1999		The plaintiff advised the defendant that the moisture levels of
the coal were due to the "torrential rain over the
Easter period" and that
"when stacked the coal was around 9%".  After giving assurances that the coal
would have good handleability
and 9.5% moisture content the plaintiff requested
the resumption of deliveries.
<P>

8 April 1999		Deliveries resumed
<P>

20 May 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff that it was suspending
deliveries because the coal delivered "in May 1999, up to
and including 14 May"
had a "Hardgrove Index in the range 64 to 71" and it was "outside the range of
44 to 54 allowed under the Contract".
 It advised that the suspension was until
it was satisfied with the steps the plaintiff intended to take within its
mining and coal
preparation operations "to ensure future deliveries are within
specification".
<P>

27 May 1999		The plaintiff advised the defendant that it was going to
investigate the technique used for the determination of HGI
to assess what had
given rise to the "changes in the HGI results".  It advised that as an
"immediate measure to resolve this issue,
and to ensure continuity of delivery
we propose to wash our coal sufficiently to stay above the rejection limit of
16% ash and below
the HGI requirement of 60".
<P>

28 May 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff it did not understand the
reference to the HGI limit of 60 and the ash content
of 16% referring to the
range of 44 to 54 for HGI and 18% to 25% for ash in cl 3.1.1.
<P>

28 May 1999		The plaintiff advised that the references were to Schedule M1,
that it proposed to deliver coal within specification
and requested resumption
of deliveries.
<P>

1 June 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff that it had "always had
considerable trouble with" the plaintiff's coal and that
the plaintiff knew
that to be the case. It stated that it was "disappointed that you can demand a
resumption of deliveries of coal
outside the specified requirements". The
defendant then purported to issue a show cause notice calling upon the
plaintiff to show
cause within 14 days why the defendant should not exercise
"the powers set out in" cl 8.41.1. The default relied upon was a "refusal
expressed" in the plaintiff's letters of 27 &amp; 28 May to deliver coal as
directed by the defendant in its letter of 20 May 1999.
<P>

8 June 1999		The plaintiff advised the defendant of its denial of the alleged
"considerable trouble" with the coal and that it had
demanded to deliver coal
outside specified requirements.  It claimed the defendant's Notice was invalid
and that there was an absence
of any reasonable grounds upon which it could
have been issued. It raised concerns about the H1 automatic sampler.  It
referred to
testing that it had carried out and to samples submitted to
laboratories other than those used by the defendant.  It claimed that
according
to the defendant's own commissioned report the H1 sampler was not operating in
accordance with Australian Standards and
that there were fundamental questions
about the accuracy of the sampling results particularly those relied upon as a
basis for the
suspension of deliveries.  After reserving its position the
plaintiff advised it would take a number of steps to ensure continued
compliance with the specifications in cl 3.1.1 and Schedule M1 and requested
resumption of deliveries.
<P>

10 June 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff, inter alia, that it was
surprised at the manner in which the plaintiff had raised
these questions about
the samples rather than in the manner required by cl 3.2.8.  It advised the
plaintiff that "the technical issues
you raise do not show cause to our
satisfaction" but thought that it owed the plaintiff the opportunity to provide
it with the reports
from other laboratories and the details of the tests the
plaintiff had commissioned and requested the plaintiff to agree to the
defendant's
expert reviewing such material.  The defendant further advised that
as a matter of courtesy it would give the plaintiff two contract
working days
of its intention to exercise the powers it believed it had under cl 8.41.1.
<P>

11 June 1999		The plaintiff was granted leave to file in Court a Summons (and
affidavits) commencing proceedings in the Equity Division
challenging the
validity of defendant's show cause notice.  The matter was returnable before
the Duty Judge on 15 June 1999 and was
by consent adjourned to 16 June 1999.
<P>

16 June 1999		By consent and without admissions the parties agreed to adjourn
the matter to 23 June 1999 with the undertaking that
the defendant would not
exercise any purported powers under cl 8.41.1and that the plaintiff would
"supply coal to the Defendant which
complies with the ash and HGI
specifications set out in clause 3.1.1 of the Contract".  It was further agreed
that subject to that
agreement to supply the "parties rights will be governed
by the Contract". Deliveries resumed.
<P>

23 June 1999		The parties agreed to a timetable for the litigation to proceed
upon pleadings.
<P>

23 June 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff that the HGI reading for coal
delivered on 21-22 June 1999 was 56 which "breaches
the agreement referred to
in the minutes of order of 16 June 1999".  The defendant reserved its rights in
respect of that delivery
and required that future deliveries conform to that
agreement.  (The plaintiff responded by phone on 24 June and by letter of 29
June advising the defendant that because of the problems with the Sampler the
results could not be accepted for the purposes of determining
compliance with
3806BV or the 16 June agreement.)
<P>

25 June 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff that the coal delivered on
22-23 June 1999 had an HGI reading of 56 in breach
of the 16 June 1999
agreement and reserved its rights in respect of that delivery.
<P>

30 June 1999		The defendant advised the plaintiff that its deliveries of 28-29
June had an HGI reading of 55 in breach of the 16
June 1999 agreement and
reserved its rights.
<P>

1 July 1999		The defendant suspended deliveries of coal because the total
moisture of the coal was above 10%.  It advised the plaintiff
that such
suspension was until it was satisfied that the plaintiff had "taken steps to
prevent further deliveries with greater than
10% moisture".
<P>

2 July 1999		The plaintiff advised that its production data indicated that it
had supplied coal with a moisture content of  "around
9.1%" and that it was
satisfied it would comply with the specification.  Deliveries were resumed.
<P>

5 July 1999		The defendant suspended deliveries because the coal had a total
moisture content of 10.5%.  It advised the plaintiff
that such suspension was
until it was "satisfied that the specification can be achieved".  The parties
had an inspection of the coal
stockpile at Howick and the defendant arranged
for sampling of coal from the inspected site.
<P>

5 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered on
29-30 June had an HGI reading of 56;  that the coal
delivered on 30 June - 1
July had an HGI reading of 58; and that the coal delivered on 1-2 July had an
HGI reading of 57 in breach
of the 16 June 1999 agreement, reserved its rights
and requested that future deliveries "conform with the agreement".
<P>

6 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the results of the
tested sample indicated that the coal was within the total
moisture content
specification.  Deliveries were resumed on the plaintiff's confirmation that
the delivered coal would be from that
site the subject of the tests.
<P>

9 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered
during the period 6 - 8 July had  an HGI reading of 59
in breach of the
agreement, reserved its rights and requested future deliveries to conform to
the agreement.
<P>

12 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered  on
8-9 July had an HGI reading of 58 with the usual
reservation and request.
<P>

14 July 1999		The defendant suspended deliveries because the total moisture
content was 10.2% and advised the plaintiff that the
suspension was until it
could be satisfied that the deliveries would meet the required specifications.
The date of the resumption
of deliveries is not clear.
<P>

15 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered on
12 July had an HGI reading of 58 and that ash was
17.3% with the usual
reservation and request.
<P>

22 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered on
21 July had an HGI reading of 56 with the usual reservation
and request.
<P>

23 July 1999		The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered on
22 July had an HGI reading of 56 with the usual reservation
and request.
<P>

28 July 1999		The defendant suspended deliveries because the coal had a total
moisture content of 10.2% and "furthermore HGI is
shown as 57".  The suspension
was until it was satisfied that "future deliveries will meet the required
specifications".  Following
an inspection by the defendant of the plaintiff's
coal and the corresponding production records the defendant advised that the
suspension
would be lifted at 3 pm.
<P>

13 August 1999	The matter was transferred to the Commercial List.
<P>

23 August 1999	The defendant notified the plaintiff that the coal delivered on
20 and 22 August had HGI readings of 68 and 67 respectively
with the usual
reservation and request.
<P>

24 August 1999	The defendant notified the plaintiff that it was suspending
deliveries because the coal delivered for 20, 22 and
23 August had HGI readings
of 68, 67 and 70 respectively.  It noted that these readings were above the
specifications in both cl
3.1.1 and in Schedule M1.  It advised the plaintiff
that it required it to satisfy it of the steps taken to restore the quality of
coal delivered to comply with "requirements set out in clause 3.1.1".
<P>

35   	On 25 August 1999 the defendant requested the plaintiff to
submit to it in accordance with clause 3.1.1 of 3806BV details
of the proposed
daily coal quantity, source and quality to be delivered during the following
week.  It also requested further information
(purportedly pursuant to cl 3.4.3)
including identification of seams, bore-core and other analytical data relating
to the coal that
had been delivered from 1 to 23 August 1999 together with
proposed washing and/or blending information in respect of coal to be delivered
"upon any resumption of coal deliveries".
<P>

36   	The plaintiff responded to that request on 26 August 1999
setting out the quantity, source and quality of coal to be delivered
between 29
August and 4 September 1999.  The additional information was not supplied. The
plaintiff resisted that supply on the basis
that the defendant was not entitled
to it as the suspension was invalid because the readings upon which it based
its decision to
suspend were unreliable and inaccurate.
<P>

37   	 These are the circumstances in which the plaintiff makes
the application for the injunction.
<P>

38   	The defendant has noted critically that what the plaintiff
is seeking in substance is a mandatory interlocutory injunction
forcing the
defendant to accept and pay for product which does not fall within a
specification which was agreed to by the defendant
on 16 June 1999.  The
plaintiff in response relied upon the statement of the learned authors Justices
Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane
in <b>Equity Doctrines and Remedies</b> (3rd<b>
</b>Edition) in which the following appears at par 2178:
<P>

"In truth, a judge hearing an application for an interlocutory mandatory
injunction must apply exactly the same tests as he would
in the case of an
application for an interlocutory prohibitory injunction, not some different or
more exacting test;  nor is the
fact that the relief sought is mandatory a
ground for refusing relief;  but in the application of the normal tests, often,
but not
always, the fact that the relief sought is mandatory will tilt the
balance of convenience in the defendant's favour".
<P>

39   	The reference to the "same tests" is a reference to the
tests which have been applied in so many cases.  There is no need
to repeat
them here except to respectfully acknowledge that they are authoritatively
stated by the High Court in <b>Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 148.</a> 
<P>

<b>Serious question to be tried</b>
<P>

40   	The plaintiff submits that I will be satisfied that there
is a serious question to be tried in respect of the validity of
the suspension
of 24 August 1999. 
<P>

<b>Absence of pre-condition to the decision to suspend</b>
<P>

41   	The plaintiff submits that the basis upon which the
defendant is entitled to suspend deliveries pursuant to cl 3.4.1 is if
the coal
is outside the required ranges specified in the contract.  The plaintiff
submits that there is a necessary pre-condition
of correct measurement of the
characteristic said to be outside the ranges before a valid suspension can be
made.  It is submitted
that the measurement is flawed because the H1 sampler
does not conform to the Australian Standards and suffers from the problems
identified in the ACIRL Report.  
<P>

42   	In those circumstances the plaintiff submits that the
flawed measurement technique is not a proper basis for a decision to
suspend.

<P>

43   	The defendant points to cl 3.2.2 and submits that as a
matter of construction the sampling required is by a sampler which
was in
existence at the time the contract was entered into.  It is then submitted that
because the plaintiff has failed to adduce
evidence that the sampler has been
in any material way altered since the time of entry into the contract it
follows that there has
been no breach.  
<P>

44   	I am not sure that I understand the force of this
submission but I am of the view that the plaintiff has established both
in
reliance upon its own evidence and that of the defendant that it is probable
that the tests from the sampler lack precision and/or
reliability.  
<P>

45   	The defendant submits that in any event the only condition
precedent to the right to suspend by reference to HGI is that <i>as a matter of
fact </i>HGI falls outside the specified range of between 54 and 44.
<P>

46   	The defendant makes the further submission that prior to
entering into the 16 June 1999 interim agreement the plaintiff had
already
become aware of the contents of the report and had already made a complaint to
the defendant that the sampler was non-compliant.
 It points to the fact that
the plaintiff is  "perfectly happy to accept the use of the sampler as an
accurate means of calculating
the purchase price" but apparently not so happy
to accept the sampler as an indicator of HGI readings.
<P>

47   	I am not of the view that there was any implicit
acceptance of the validity of the sampling process by reason of the parties
entering into the 16 June 1999 agreement.  There was certainly no express term
to such an effect. 
<P>

48   	However it is beyond doubt that by the 16 June 1999
agreement the parties agreed that the coal to be supplied was to be within
the
range 44 - 54.  The evidence is clear that notwithstanding the non-compliance
of the H1 Sampler and the unreliability of the
readings it is "highly unlikely
that" the delivered coal would have "been within the range of 44-54".  The
plaintiff's expert agreed
with this evidence.  I am of the view that this
evidence defeats the plaintiff's otherwise cogent case in respect of this
aspect
of the matter.
<P>

49   	In those circumstances I am of the view that there is not
a serious question to be tried.
<P>

<b>Reasonableness</b>
<P>

50   	The plaintiff submits that the authorities support the
existence of an obligation upon the defendant to exercise its rights
to suspend
under cl 3.4.1 reasonably and in good faith and not capriciously or
arbitrarily.

<P>

51   	The plaintiff submits that the defendant is acting
unreasonably and in bad faith in the 24 August suspension of coal deliveries.
It is submitted that the defendant's real purpose is to raise technical
objections to the supply of coal under the contract in order
to bring about a
renegotiation of the coal price.  In support of this submission the plaintiff
relied upon the following statement
of Sheller JA in <b>Alcatel Australlia v
Scarcella</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 483</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 349</a> at 368:
<P>

"If a contract confers powers on a contracting party in terms wider than
necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests
of that party, the
courts may interpret the power as not extending to the action proposed by the
party in whom the power is vested
or, alternatively, conclude that the powers
are being exercised in a capricious or arbitrary manner or for an extraneous
purpose
which is another way of saying the same thing".
<P>

52   	Additionally the plaintiff relied on Priestley JA's
judgment in <b>Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public
Works</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 234</a> where His Honour said at 258:
<P>

"It seems clear that the words of the clause empower the principal to give them
notice to show cause upon any default in carrying
out any requirement in the
contract.  Thus for a completely trivial default the principal can give a
notice to show cause.  It is
possible to imagine many situations in which, if a
notice for some trivial breach were given the contractor might fail, as a
matter
of fact, to show cause within the specified period to the satisfaction
of the principal why the power should not be exercised against
them.
<P>

For the principal, in such circumstances, to be able then to exclude the
contractor from the site and/or cancel the contract would
be, in my opinion, to
make the contract, as a matter of business, quite unworkable".  
<P>

53   	This is a long term contract for the supply of coal over a
twenty year period.   The present contract has been in place for
the last eight
and half years.  
<P>

54   	The contract sets up a regime (cl 1.3.1) of a day to day
liaison with direct communications between the defendant's operations
and the
plaintiff's operations by direct phone link or radio communication.  The
capacity to adjust the price of the coal delivered
to the advantage of the
defendant is established by the formulae in cl 7.16.  The parties have agreed
to co-operate for the installation
of an automatic system to record the
conveyer transfer capacity (cl 4.2.2).  The defendant is required to provide a
minimum of six
months notice to the plaintiff of any proposed change to the
coal quota (cl 2.1).  
<P>

55   	The defendant points to cl 3.4.1 which refers to breaches
of coal specifications irrespective of consequences and contrasts
it to the
breaches referred to in cl 3.4.2 which block the conveyer system.  It submits
that the power in cl 3.4.1 is not expressed
to be subject to a requirement that
it be exercised reasonably in contrast with the language used in cl 8.41.1 by
which the power
to issue a show cause notice is expressly required to be
exercised reasonably.
<P>

56   	The defendant submits that there is no analogy between the
suspension from time to time of goods which do not comply with
the contract and
the right of termination for failure to show cause.  In this regard the
defendant distinguishes this case from the
contracts and circumstances the
court was considering in <b>Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Limited v Minister
for Public Works </b>(1992) NSWLR 234 and <b>Hughes Aircraft System
International v Airservices Australia </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/558.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 558</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20146%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 146 ALR 1</a> and submits that
such a term or obligation would not be implied in this case.  It is submitted
that to do so would be to take an
inappropriate leap of faith to which Gummow J
referred in <b>Service Station Association Limited v Berg Bennett &amp;
Associates Pty Limited </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/445.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 445</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2045%20FCR%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 45 FCR 84</a> at 96.
<P>

57   	The right in cl 3.4.1 has to be read in the light of the
provisions in cl 7.16.1.2 and cl 3.4.3.  The system set up by the
contract to
require the plaintiff to submit to the defendant the proposal to convince it to
exercise its discretion to lift the suspension
is further evidence which could
be relied upon to submit that an obligation to act reasonably would be implied
into this contract.
 If that were not so the contract would become unworkable.

<P>

58   	Although the defendant submits that this suspension is not
analogous to the right to terminate the contract for failure to
show cause, it
is important to note that if the defendant exercises its right to suspend and
the monthly transfer capacity is reduced
such a reduction is "considered as
being due to a failure to deliver coal on the part of the" plaintiff (cl
3.4.3).  In those circumstances
the combination of cl 4.3 and 8.41 leads me to
the view that the exercise of the right is more analogous to the termination
for failure
to show cause than the defendant accepts.
<P>

59   	Clause 7.16.1.2 provides the defendant with a discretion
to either accept or to reject coal outside the specified ranges.
 So far as HGI
readings are concerned the defendant has not rejected coal because of high HGI
readings until May of this year.  Mr
Jackman, in final address, submitted that
there were two reasons why the discretion to suspend deliveries has been
exercised where
in the past such discretion was not exercised.  
<P>

60   	The first is that there is a real risk of handleability
problems in accepting coal with high HGI readings.  The second is
that if the
defendant has to pay what it regards as a high price for its coal it is
entitled to reject it if it does not fit within
specification.
<P>

61   	As to the handleability problems it is clear that the
defendant puts its case only on the basis of risk.  Handleability had
not
occurred because of high HGI readings although there have been handleability
problems which on the evidence seem to have been
attributed to moisture
content.  The high HGI readings between 1991 and 1999 were apparently not a
sufficient "risk" to handleability
to warrant the exercise of a discretion to
suspend during that period and it is submitted that the court would receive
such a submission
with circumspection.  It is submitted that such a history
supports the submission that the real reason the defendant has suspended
 the
deliveries is because it wishes to extract itself from this contract with the
plaintiff and/or force the plaintiff to agree
to a cheaper price for the
coal.
<P>

62   	As to the second matter in relation to having to pay a
high price for its coal it is appropriate to refer back to the penalty
provisions contained in cl. 7.16.  3806BV makes specific provision for
adjustment of the price when the plaintiff exercises its discretion
to accept
coal outside the specified ranges.  Although there is no specific  provision
for the adjustment of the price when coal
has a high HGI reading there is an
adjustment available when the coal has caused a loss of pulverising capacity
and other inefficiencies
(cl 7.16.4).
<P>

63   	It seems to me that these clauses recognise that the
defendant has agreed to pay a specific price for the coal and sets out
the
circumstances in which it can act to adjust the price it has to pay.  
<P>

64   	The defendant has been very candid in admitting that it is
motivated by pecuniary interests and has posed the question - why
should it
have to accept coal which it did not contract to buy?   This is a very good
question and it becomes a very powerful one
in the light of the 16 June 1999
agreement and the evidence (not in issue) that it is "highly unlikely" that
this particular coal
would have been within the range contracted for on 16 June
- that is 44-54.
<P>

65   	I am conscious of the submission made by the plaintiff
that reasonableness is not to be judged by the criterion that two experts
may
agree, ex post facto, on the likelihood of the range of readings of the
particular coal.  However I am of the view that the evidence
of the experts
weighs heavily against the plaintiff in the light of its voluntary agreement on
16 June 1999.
<P>

66   	I am of the view that there is a strong case that the
defendant has an obligation to exercise the power in cl 3.4.1 reasonably.
 But
I fail to see how there can be a serious question to be tried that the
defendant failed to act reasonably or acted in bad faith
in the circumstances
where:
<P>

&#183;	on 16 June 1999 the plaintiff agreed to deliver coal with HGI within the
range 44 -54;
<P>

&#183;	had received notification from the defendant that on 12 occasions the
coal delivered between 21 June and 23 August was outside
the agreed range and
the defendant was reserving its position in respect of those readings;  and
<P>

&#183;	no suspension occurred until the HGI readings were at least 68.
<P>

67   	I am not satisfied that there is a serious question to be
tried in respect of this aspect of matter.
<P>

<b>Estoppel  </b>
<P>

68   	The plaintiff submits that the defendant is estopped from
suspending deliveries for non-compliance because of its acceptance
of coal with
such characteristic in the past in reliance upon which the plaintiff has
organised its affairs, in particular the very
large expenditure on its Coal
Preparation Plant and equipment.
<P>

69   	The defendant submits that the Coal Preparation Plant was
set up to meet contract specifications which included an upper limit
to the HGI
Index.  It also submits that the defendant has made it very clear since at
least March of this year that it would only
accept coal which was within
specification.
<P>

70   	The defendant submits that no estoppel could conceivably
have survived the agreement reached on 16 June 1999 which by mutual
consent
requires strict adherence to contractual specifications.  It submits that
reasonable notice has been given to the plaintiff
in respect of any assumed
state of affairs upon which it was proceeding <b>(Central Land Property Trust
Limited v Hightrees House Limited </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%201%20KB%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 1 KB 130</a>;  <b>Commonwealth v
Verwayen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2070%20CLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 70 CLR 394</a> per Deane J at 442.3).
<P>

71   	The summary of the contractual history extracted earlier
in this judgment satisfies me that the defendant both expressly and
by
implication made it abundantly clear that it was going to require strict
compliance with the terms of 3806BV and with the 16 June
1999 agreement.
<P>

72   	I agree with the defendant's submission that any estoppel
that may have been extant as at June 1999 was jettisoned by the
agreement of
the parties on 16 June 1999.  Accordingly I am not satisfied that there is a
serious question to be tried in respect
of this aspect of the matter.
<P>

<b>Balance of Convenience/Damages</b>
<P>

73   	Because of the above findings I do not need to address
this question.  However if I had been required so to do I would have
agreed
with the defendant's submission that the plaintiff had not established that an
award of damages was not an appropriate remedy.
<P>

74   	In my view, although the plaintiff made detailed
submissions on this topic,  the most persuasive submission advanced was the
inadequacy of such a remedy as the plaintiff could not pursue other contracts
because it had to effectively stand at the ready to
deliver to the plaintiff if
and when the suspension was lifted.  In those circumstances it was submitted
that it would not be possible
to quantify what the plaintiff had lost in that
period of standing at the ready.  
<P>

75   	Although attractive at first blush the commercial
realities of the capacity of the plaintiff tempered its attractiveness.
 It is
the case that the plaintiff is a corporation with a capacity to explore other
ventures notwithstanding its contractual obligations
to the defendant.  The
plaintiff's evidence included references to such ventures and indeed the cross
examination of Mr Devlin exposed
the plaintiff's publicly stated capacity to
enter the export market in a fairly convincing fashion.
<P>

76   	This is a suspension which is not challenged on the basis
that the defendant has unreasonably refused to lift it after proper
compliance
by the plaintiff with the request for a proposal under clause 3.4.3.  It was
challenged as a suspension which was invalid
for the reasons outlined earlier.
Assuming I am wrong in respect of the serious question to be tried, I am of the
view that damages
would be an adequate remedy. 
<P>

<b>Order</b>
<P>

77   	The application for the injunctive relief in paragraph 1
of the Notice of Motion is refused.
