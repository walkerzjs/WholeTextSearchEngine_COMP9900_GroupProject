<b>overview</b>
<P>

1   	The Defendants contest the continuance of the Plaintiff's
two caveats.  They do so on the ground that they fail, beyond any
possible
remediation under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</i> 1900</a> (NSW), to specify
any estate or interest, legal or equitable, known to the law.  The Plaintiff
contends, first, the specification
was of an equitable interest compliant in
form, second, even if it were non-compliant, any such failure would be cured by
the directive
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L.</a>
<P>

"  <b>74L</b>  If in any legal proceedings a question arises as to the validity
of a caveat lodged under a provision of this Part, the court shall
disregard
any failure of the caveator to comply strictly with the requirements of this
Part, and of any regulations made for the
purposes of this Part, with respect
to the form of the caveat."
<P>

<b>MATERIAL FACTS</b>
<P>

2   	The following can be treated as uncontroversial as a
description of the circumstances giving rise to the matter before me.
<P>

3   	Following the service of lapsing notices pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74j.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74J</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i> ("RPA"), the Plaintiff filed a  summons on 30
September 1999 seeking the extension of two caveats over two parcels of land of
which
the Defendants are variously the registered proprietors.  Austin J
granted ex parte orders extending the operation of those caveats
on 30
September and 6 October.   The orders have been registered by the Registrar
General.   The Plaintiff's Summons seeks relief
not only in relation to the
caveats but also declarations as to the validity of certain unregistered
mortgages alleged to have been
given by the Defendants.
<P>

4   	The parties have filed various affidavits and the
Defendants have changed solicitors once.  They are now represented by Messrs
Fiddes of New Lambton and are represented by counsel.
<P>

5   	On 1 and 2 October 1999 the Defendants filed motions
seeking various relief including directions as to pleadings, the further
conduct of the proceedings and orders relating to the hearing of proceedings in
the Common law Division in which the first mortgagee
seeks possession of one of
the properties the subject of one of the caveats.  That first mortgagee has
also listed the other property
the subject of the second caveat for sale on 28
November 1999.
<P>

6   	There is evidence (at this stage still contested) that the
First and Second Defendants, by a conveyance of one of the properties
to one of
their daughters, and the Second and Third Defendants, by refinancing the second
property, are able to raise funds which,
together with other funds from other
family members will be sufficient to pay out the first mortgagee and bring the
common law proceedings
to an end.  The final hearing will need to deal with
other grounds of attack on the second mortgage.  
<P>

7   	Against that background, the matter comes before the Court
today for a separate determination of the limited issue of the validity
of the
two caveats lodged by the Plaintiff and whose operation has so far been
extended by the Court.
<P>

8   	The Defendants say that the caveats do not on their face
allege a caveatable interest.
<P>

9   	The First and Second Defendants are the registered
proprietors of all that piece or parcel of land contained in Folio Identifier
32/E/109967 at which the Defendants and some of their children reside ("the
home").   There is a registered first mortgage to FWO
Nominees Pty Limited
("FWO") and the Plaintiff alleges that it is entitled to a second mortgage.
<P>

10   	The Second and Third Defendants are the registered
proprietors of all that piece or parcel of land contained in Folio Identifier
7/550349 situate at and known as 189 Myall Street, Teagardens used for holidays
("the holiday home").   There is also a registered
first mortgage over this
property to FWO and the Plaintiff again alleges that it is entitled to a second
mortgage.
<P>

11   	The validity of the second mortgages does not presently
arise and is to be determined on final hearing.
<P>

12   	It is the operation of the caveats 3911823 and 3911844
which has been extended.
<P>

<b>THE QUESTION FOR DETERMINATION</b>
<P>

13   	The only question for determination on this application
can, then, be stated in short compass:  Does the estate or interest
recorded in
caveats 3911823 and 3911844 meet the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74F(5)(b)(v)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i>, insofar as it requires the caveat to specify "the
prescribed particulars of the legal or equitable estate to which the caveator
claims to be entitled"?  The only relevant prescription is that contained in
the <i>Real Property Regulation</i> 1993 (NSW) Schedule 2 of which providing
(in cl 8(4)) that "If the caveator claims as mortgagee, chargee or covenant
chargee, a statement
of ... the nature of the debt, annuity, rent charge or
other charge secured on the land."
<P>

14   	The Defendant made clear that it did contest the
continuance of the caveats on the basis of balance of convenience.
<P>

15   	The relevant caveats (see agreed bundle pages 17-22) each
contain the following description of the nature of the estate or
interest in
the relevant land under "estate or interest claimed":  "As equitable mortgagee
of the fee simple in the said land." 

<P>

16   	This is in each case by virtue of an instrument described
as "mortgage" in favour of the named parties being the First and
Second
Defendants in the first case and the Second and Third Defendants in the second
case.  There follows this description: 
<P>

"The registered proprietors have agreed to grant to the Caveator a mortgage of
the fee simple in the said land in consideration
of a loan or other financial
accommodation granted by the Caveator at the request of the registered
proprietors."
<P>

17   	For present purposes I shall treat as established on a
prima facie basis and subject of course to the resolution of the matters
earlier referred to in a final hearing, that the relevant Defendants are
grantors of unregistered mortgages by way of a second mortgage
ranking after a
first mortgage in each case.
<P>

18   	Turning now to the grounds of attack upon the caveat,
these are essentially that the description of the estate or interest
claimed
repeated in the reference to the relevant instrument is such as to describe an
interest not known to the law in respect of
what is Torrens System land.  This
is because it is said that the Torrens System makes no provision for the
mortgage of the fee simple.
 
<P>

19   	It is contended that under the Torrens System all that is
left after the granting of a registered first mortgage is an interest
in the
equity of redemption.  Alternatively, it is contended that even if, as
registered proprietor, such a mortgagor retains a statutory
interest equivalent
to a fee simple, the granting of an unregistered equitable mortgage could not
be "of" the fee simple.  It is
conceded that the grantee of an unregistered
mortgage Torrens System land can properly be described as "equitable mortgagee"
when
it comes to describing the estate or interest claimed.  This is because
the mortgagee in those circumstances has, whilst unregistered,
no statutory
interest but an interest properly described as equitable, recognised
nonetheless by the Torrens system; see, for example,
<i>Frazer v Walker</i>
[1967] 1 AC 569, 580 and 585 and numerous authorities since.  It is equitable
insofar as it touches the conscience of the mortgagor
and insofar as equity
will enforce the mortgagee's rights including to be registered.  
<P>

20   	Thus the problem lies solely in the concluding words "of
the fee simple in the said land".  
<P>

21   	While it is undoubtedly correct that the Torrens system
creates by statute interests which become upon their registration
legal
interests, it is well settled that the Torrens system does not preclude
equitable interests such as that presently before me.
 The fundamental
difference between Old System title and Torrens Title is this.  Under old
System, the grant of a registered first
mortgage is a conveyance of the title
by way of mortgage, leaving only the equity of redemption.  Under the Torrens
system the grant
of a first mortgage carves out an interest by way of mortgage
which becomes a legal interest upon its registration.  Prior to registration,
it operates in equity upon the conscience of the mortgagor.  Thus, as is said
in Butt "Land Law" LBC 1996 at 536:  
<P>

"It is common to describe the Torrens title mortgagor's interest as an "equity
of redemption".  This is acceptable in so far as
it recognises the mortgagor's
right to seek equity's aid in enforcing rights analogous to those enjoyed by a
mortgagor of old system
title land,87  including the right to redeem after the
contractual date for payment has passed.  But in fact the Torrens title
mortgagor
has more than a mere equity of redemption:  the Torrens title
mortgagor remains the registered proprietor of the land  --  the owner,
not
only in equity but also at law.88  This means that not all of the principles
applicable to the equity of redemption in its classical,
old system, form can
be carried over into the Torrens system.89  For example, a Torrens title
mortgagor can pass the "legal" title
to the land to a purchaser, and a second
or subsequent mortgage of Torrens title land is not a mortgage of a mere
equitable interest."

<P>

22   	Later at 537 Butt says of unregistered mortgages under the
Torrens system:
<P>

"Torrens title mortgages are sometimes left unregistered.  There are a number
of reasons for this:  the mortgage might not be embodied
in an instrument (as
in the case of a mortgage by deposit of title deeds);  or it might be embodied
in an instrument that is not
in registrable form;  or the parties may omit to
register it, by oversight or design.  But whatever the reason for
non-registration,
unregistered mortgages of Torrens title land are regarded as
being in the nature of equitable mortgages, and are enforced in the
same way as
equitable mortgages.95 "
<P>

<i>95 	Barry v Heider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1914/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1914] HCA 79</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281914%29%2019%20CLR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1914) 19 CLR 197</a>;  J &amp; H Just (Holdings) Pty Ltd v

<P>

23   	Turning then to the additional words that I have earlier
quoted under equitable mortgagee, the word "of" preceding the reference
to "fee
simple" would be incorrect if it were to suggest that the fee simple is
conveyed or has somehow vested in whole or part with
the equitable mortgagee.
But the word "of", if it had been replaced by the alternative expression "in
relation to", would be a not
inapt description of the estate or interest
claimed.  It is in that sense analogous to the position of a beneficiary in an
unadministered
estate, described in <i>Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v
Livingston</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1964/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] UKPC 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20AC%20694" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] AC 694</a> as a "right in personam ad rem".
<P>

24   	It is therefore difficult to view the misdescription as at
worst, other than technical.  At best it is not a misdescription
at all, if the
word "of" be construed in the way I have earlier referred as equivalent to "in
relation to".
<P>

25   	Thus even if the defect is taken to exist, I am satisfied
that it is the kind of defect which the Court is required to disregard
under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> </i>
<P>

26   	<i>Beca Developments Pty Ltd v Idameneo (No 92) Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 459</a> and <i>In the Marriage of Stevens</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2015%20Fam%20LR%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 15 Fam
LR 51</a> indicate that in New South Wales the court now has the power to overlook
any deficiency in the drafting of the caveat provided that
the caveator
possesses a caveatable interest of some description and even though that latter
is not specified at all.  In <i>Beca Developments Pty Ltd v Idameneo (No 92)
Pty Ltd</i>, Clarke JA (at 471-472) reviewed the amendments made to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</i> 1900</a> (NSW) which accompanied the introduction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss74K</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">74L</a>
and said:
<P>

"It is clear that the legislature has set out in these sections to remedy the
problems which previously arose from a technical approach
to the description of
the interest claimed in the caveat, the unrestricted specifications of the
dealings the recording of which
were forbidden by the caveat and the lodging of
caveats which on their face did not comply with the requirements of the
relevant
part of the Act"
<P>

He considered that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L</a> excused both a technical deficiency in the description
of the interest claimed and an excessively wide prohibition against dealings
(at 475).  In <i>In the Marriage of Stevens</i> (supra), failure to describe
the interest claimed as an interest capable of supporting a caveat was excused
on the basis that the
evidence showed that the caveator did have an interest in
the property.  At 53, Cohen J said:
<P>

"I regard the reference to form of the caveat [in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L]</a> as including issues
over whether the caveatable interest claimed in the document is a caveatable
interest.  If this is not the case,
the purpose of the whole part [of the Act]
... is defeated.  It was recently amended in such a way that its clear intent
is to overcome
the strict rules for validity of caveats which had, until the
amendment, developed through judicial interpretation."
<P>

27   	I should make it clear that based on these authorities the
curative power of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L</a> is clearly not to be treated as limited to technical
defects in areas other than the description of the estate or interest.  I have
already concluded that the present defect, if it be one, is certainly not of
such fundamentality as to give rise to an interest unknown
to the law.  Clearly
enough the Plaintiff has a caveatable interest as equitable mortgagee in
relation to the mortgagors equity of
redemption which, though unregistered, can
be called in aid though the present description be deficient.  That indeed is
precisely
what <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L</a> mandates.
<P>

28   	Finally, I should say that I do not consider that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L</a>,
when operative, creates any necessity for orders to the effect that a
substitute caveat be lodged which omits or corrects the non-compliant
material.
Such an interpretation would ignore the mandatory language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s74L.</a>  
<P>

29   	It follows that the Plaintiff's caveats the subject of the
question before me are not to be set aside based upon the contentions
of the
Defendants.  The question earlier posed should be answered in the
affirmative.
<P>

<b>ORDERS AND COSTS</b>
<P>

30   	I make the following orders (2 and 3 being by consent):
<P>

1.	Caveats Nos. 3911823 and 3911844 are valid.
<P>

2.	That all issues between the parties proceed on pleadings with evidence by
affidavit in the usual way.
<P>

3.	The matter to be stood over to the Registrar's List on 23 November 1999 for
directions.
<P>

4.	The Defendant to pay the Plaintiff's costs such to be assessed forthwith.
