<b><u>WEDNESDAY, 1 DECEMBER 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>NEWCASTLE:  63/97  -  MILLER  v  HAWKINS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is a claim for damages for
personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident which happened on 23
July 1996. Breach
of duty of care has been admitted by the defendant thus the
matter is one for the assessment of damages pursuant to the <b>Motor Accidents
Act</b> 1988 should the plaintiff qualify for such damages.
<P>

2   	Because a breach of duty has been conceded by the defendant
it is not necessary for me to examine the circumstances of the
accident in
great detail. However, it is relevant to note that the accident involved a
collision between two motor cars of great
severity. Photographs of the
plaintiff's car demonstrate the impaction between the vehicles was one
involving considerable force.
<P>

3   	That the plaintiff suffered injuries in the accident was
not the subject of any contest. Such was the force of the impact that
her knees
had come into contact with the dashboard of the vehicle and her chest came into
hard contact with the steering wheel.
<P>

4   	She was taken from the scene of the accident which was in
the Newcastle area, to the John Hunter hospital. At that hospital
investigations revealed that she had suffered the following injuries:
<P>

1.	A fracture of the inferior pole of her right patella.
<P>

2.	Lacerations and soft tissue injuries to both her knees including trauma to
both patella.
<P>

3.	Soft tissue injuries to her lower back.
<P>

4.	Soft tissue injuries to her cervical spine.
<P>

5.	Fracture to her left 6th, 7th, and 8th ribs.
<P>

6.	Bruising caused by her seat belt to her right shoulder and left breast.
<P>

7.	Facial bruising.
<P>

8.	Bruising to her left upper arm.
<P>

5   	Her immediate treatment involved suturing of the
lacerations over her left knee, bed rest and the administration of pain killing
medication.
<P>

6   	She came under the care of her general practitioner, Dr S
Cawley and an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr P Berton. Shortly after the
accident the
plaintiff commenced a regime of physiotherapy which, with certain variations of
treatment, has continued to the present
day.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff suffers pain in her neck, low back and both
knees. She also commenced to develop headaches. In addition to the
physiotherapy program she also undertook supervised hydrotherapy involving
flotation, massage and other hydro-therapeutic measures.
<P>

8   	In September 1996 she was referred to a rehabilitation
specialist, a Dr C Hollo in relation to the pain she was suffering in
her neck
and low back. Essentially, the plaintiff has been under the care of Dr Berton
for the problems which she has had with her
knees and Dr Hollo for her neck and
low back pain up to the present time. Additionally, she has been attending her
general practitioner,
Dr Cawley.
<P>

9   	At the time of the accident the plaintiff was employed as a
customer service manager and was initially off work for a period
of
approximately three months before returning to a restricted work program.
<P>

10   	For some time after the accident the plaintiff, who lived
alone, required assistance from members of her family to carry out
the normal
functions of living. This assistance, as I understand the evidence, continued
until she first resumed work.
<P>

11   	It is convenient in dealing with the plaintiff's injuries
to deal with them separately. I shall first detail her history from
October
1996 in relation to her knee problems.
<P>

12   	Such was the condition of her knees that Dr Berton advised
that she undergo surgery. She was admitted to the Lake Macquarie
Private
hospital on 13 November 1996 where Dr Berton performed the procedures of
bilateral arthroscopies and lateral releases to
her left and right legs. She
remained in hospital until 18 November 1996 when she was discharged on crutches
and bandages. Again
her treatment involved the use of physiotherapy and
administration of pain killing medication.
<P>

13   	As time went by improvement occurred in the condition of
her knees although in February 1997 she still reported sensation
of crunching
and aching in those parts of her body.
<P>

14   	She returned to work on 17 February 1997 again working
restricted hours and also having restrictions upon any physical activities
she
might have to undertake, limited though these might be in the banking
industry.
<P>

15   	As time went by she continued to suffer pain in both her
knees. In December 1998 she again saw Dr Berton who felt that she
required
further surgical intervention and as a consequence on 27 January 1999 she was
admitted to the Warners Bay Private hospital
where Dr Berton carried out a
procedure of bilateral arthroscopic chrondroplasty debridement.
<P>

16   	Following that procedure she suffered an infection to her
knees which required the administration of antibiotics. She sought
a second
opinion from Dr B Jones, orthopaedic surgeon, who, on 15 February 1999, opined
that the plaintiff had a closed injury to
both her patellae with articular
cartilage degeneration.
<P>

17   	She returned to Dr Berton's care in February 1999. At that
time the infection in her knees had cleared. Dr Berton advised
the plaintiff to
undertake hydrotherapy which she did. At that time he felt that the plaintiff
was likely to undergo further surgical
procedures to her knees.
<P>

18   	Pain continued in her knees. In September 1999 she
consulted another orthopaedic surgeon, Dr R Smith who was of the view that
the
plaintiff would ultimately develop severe osteoarthritis in both knees and
would require the procedure of knee replacement to
be carried out.
<P>

19   	Dr Berton is of the same view as Dr Smith. The procedure
is generally described as being a knee replacement. While this is
a matter for
the future, Dr Berton is of the view that her need for knee replacement is in
the order of 1:4. Not only that, he is
of the view that both her knees are
likely to require tibial osteotomy in the short to medium term. He is of the
view that her permanent
loss of use of both her legs at or above the knee is in
the order of 30%.
<P>

20   	There is nothing in the medical reports tendered on behalf
of the defendant which is contrary to the views expressed by Drs
Smith and
Berton as to her future management and Dr Berton's view as to the extent of her
disability as relating to her knees.
<P>

21   	Prior to the subject accident the plaintiff had suffered
occasional pain in her knees. This had caused her to seek advice
from a general
practitioner. The advice tendered to her was to reduce her netball playing
activities and to loose weight. However,
there is nothing in the medical
evidence to suggest that her present problems, as far as her knees are
concerned, are related to
anything else but the subject accident.
<P>

22   	The plaintiff's complaints of neck and low back pain are
the subject of contest in this matter. As I have said, she has been
principally
under the care of Dr Hollo in relation to these matters. She has also received
treatment from a Dr D Pacey, another rehabilitation
specialist. I should add
that Dr Pacey has also expressed views relating to the condition of the
plaintiff's knees which is on all
fours with those expressed by Drs Smith and
Berton as far as her views go.
<P>

23   	The treatment afforded the plaintiff for her complaints of
neck and low back pain were initially treated in a conservative
fashion.
However, in August 1997 Dr Hollo advised the plaintiff to undergo injections to
her occipital region which are known as
zygapophysial joint blocks.
<P>

24   	She underwent a number of these procedures in August,
September and October 1997. These produced some immediate relief. Again
in
November 1997 Dr Hollo performed another of these procedures. Once more she
received temporary relief to her symptoms from it.
In February and April 1998
these procedures were repeated. She has had further such procedures
administered by Dr Hollo in September
1998. Again, giving rise it seems, to
short term relief.
<P>

25   	On viewing the radiological evidence and considering the
plaintiff's clinical presentation, Dr Hollo is of the view that the
plaintiff
is suffering from what she described as C2/3 cervical segmental dysfunction.
<P>

26   	Dr Hollo has suggested that the plaintiff should undergo a
procedure which is known as percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy.
Indeed, the
plaintiff was scheduled to have this procedure carried out on 17 June 1999.
Because of doubts entertained by the plaintiff
as to the side effects which
might flow from the administration of this procedure she decided not to proceed
with that planned treatment.
Her view is that she would prefer to wait until
medical science can provide her with a more definite prognosis as to the side
effects
which might flow from this treatment. However, on the other hand she
stated, in evidence, that in the future she may well undergo
that procedure.
<P>

27   	In all Dr Hollo administered some six cervical diagnostic
block to the plaintiff. She continued to complain of neck pain.
<P>

28   	Dr Tarrant, who saw her on behalf of the defendant, does
not suggest that the plaintiff's complaint of neck pain is anything
but
genuine. He is sceptical of the need for further invasive treatment of her neck
and feels that conservative measures are more
likely to be of benefit to
her.
<P>

29   	Likewise Professor Jones, who saw her, does not deny that
the plaintiff suffers neck pain. Like Dr Tarrant, Professor Jones
is somewhat
sceptical as to the value of the invasive procedures which are being carried
out. He concluded as follows:
<P>

<i>"On balance I am concerned regarding the plethora of opinions regarding Ms
Miller's treatment and her continuing to seek such invasive
therapies. As to
whether they will ultimately be in her best interests is a moot point. She is
also exhibiting complications from
such treatments, and perhaps her being
taught relaxation techniques and management of her pain by appropriate
analgesics would be
an alternative which her own doctors might
contemplate."</i>
<P>

30   	I turn then to the plaintiff's complaint of low back pain.
Dr Hollo has expressed the view that the plaintiff has a lumbar
segmental
dysfunction affecting either the L4/5 or the L5/S1 levels. While the treatment
the plaintiff has received for her low back
pain has been largely conservative
she underwent an L5 sinuvertebral nerve block on 7 August 1998. She had a good
response to that
treatment and Dr Pacey whom, as I have said, has also been
seeing the plaintiff, expressed the view that that result indicated that
her
back pain arose from damage to her lumbo-sacral disc. She underwent a further
L5 block on 29 October 1998 and again that provided
her with some relief.
<P>

31   	Dr Hopcroft, orthopaedic surgeon, has seen her on a number
of occasions over the years. He, in relation to both her neck and
back pain,
does not give any specific diagnosis of what is causing that pain but does not
suggest that it is anything but genuine.

<P>

32   	Again, neither Professor Jones or Dr Tarrant suggest
otherwise. However, as is the case with the plaintiff's complaint of
neck pain
they are concerned about the matter of over-servicing.
<P>

33   	Additionally, the plaintiff suffers from a psychological
reaction to her problems which involve, inter alia, her suffering
from panic
attacks while travelling as a passenger in a motor car. She was treated in this
regard by Lyn Porritt, psychologist. It
seems that Lyn Porritt's treatment has
been successful in relation to the panic attacks and was of assistance to the
plaintiff generally
in relation to her overall condition. However, it may well
be that she will require further assistance in terms of this discipline
in the
future.
<P>

34   	The plaintiff's residual scarring has been assessed by Dr
C Howe, plastic surgeon. In December 1998 he reported that there
was
significant scarring on both knees which are in fact obvious even to a lay
observer. On the right side they consist of a vertical
40mm scar lateral to the
patella and another 40mm scar on the infra-patella region. On the left side
there is a 30mm oblique scar
over the patella and a 20mm and 30mm L shaped scar
on the infra-patella border and a 40mm broad surgical scar on the left lateral
patella.
<P>

35   	He felt that this scarring constituted a moderate cosmetic
disability/disfigurement and is of the order of 15% of the worst
case. He does
not advise any further treatment for these scars and his evidence was not the
subject of any contest.
<P>

36   	I turn then to the plaintiff's work history. As I have
said at the time of her accident the plaintiff was employed as a customer
service manager. She had been working with Westpac since December 1982 and
advanced through their ranks to the position she occupied
at the time of the
accident. She had attained the Higher School Certificate in 1982 and joined
Westpac shortly after having completed
her studies.
<P>

37   	As already noted she was initially off work until 14
October 1996 when she resumed working restricted hours. These hours were
increased in November 1996 but she was off work from 7 November 1996 until 17
February 1997. On her resuming work in February 1997
the plaintiff's hours of
work were increased. Over the years the number of hours she has worked have
increased until from 7 August
1998 she commenced full duties.
<P>

38   	When she returned to full time duties in August 1998, she
returned as relief manager. She is presently the manager of the
Mayfield branch
of the bank. She found herself exhausted at the end of a day's work. She
retires to bed early and her social life
has been severely restricted.
<P>

39   	Prior to her injury as I have already mentioned she was a
netball player and she also was a keen snow skier. Since her accident
she has
not participated in any of her former sporting pursuits and particularly having
regard to the condition of her knees I am
of the view that she will not in the
future, engage in any sporting activities.
<P>

40   	Her future with the bank is by no means certain. Tendered
in evidence were letters which had been circulated to staff members
from the
Westpac Chief Executive Officer and State Manager indicating that in the future
staff cuts will occur. On the open labour
market the plaintiff in the light of
her disabilities may well have difficulties in obtaining employment should she
be retrenched
from Westpac. All of this of course falls within the bounds of
possibility rather than probability.
<P>

41   	I turn then to the assessment of damages. The first matter
which is to be considered is damages for non-economic loss pursuant
to s 79A of
the <b>Motor Accidents Act</b> 1988. For accidents occurring after 26 September
1995 the maximum amount presently awarded is $273,000. Having regard to the
nature
of the plaintiff's injuries, her loss of enjoyment of life and the pain
she has suffered and will suffer in the future together with
the possibility of
further surgical intervention, I assess her as being a person who has lost 50%
of the most extreme case. That
quantifies as $136,500.
<P>

42   	The plaintiff's out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed,
on a mathematical basis between the parties, at $67,490.95. As I
have already
noted both Dr Tarrant and Professor Jones, and to a certain degree, Dr
Hopcroft, are sceptical as to the amount of treatment
the plaintiff has
received. It has been contended on behalf of the defendant that it would not be
reasonable for the defendant to
have to meet the full amount of the
out-of-pockets incurred.
<P>

43   	However, I am of the view that the plaintiff has been
acting reasonably in accepting the advice of her medical advisers. Indeed,
as I
have noted above the plaintiff has deferred undergoing the invasive
radiotherapy prescribed by Dr Hollo. In these circumstances
I am of the view
that the plaintiff is entitled to the full amount of out-of-pockets incurred
and I thus award the sum of $67,490.95
under this head.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff's past wage loss came to a net amount of
$27,224.42. In addition to this net amount there is a sum of $5,473.10
representing taxation exactions made by her employer when compensation payments
were made. (Fox v Wood component) In all the plaintiff's
total past economic
loss amounts to $32,697.52 and I allow this amount.
<P>

45   	I turn then to the question of future medical expenses. Dr
Berton has stated that the cost of bilateral tibial osteotomies
will be
$20,000. There being a 1:4 chance that the plaintiff may require total knee
replacements I believe it is reasonable to allow
an additional sum of $10,000
for the 1:4 chance of this procedure being undertaken and referred to by Dr
Berton. I believe there
is a real doubt that the plaintiff will undergo the
percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy treatment suggested by Dr Hollo. The cost
of the five procedures suggested by Dr Hollo would be $33,000 odd. Because I
believe that this treatment falls into the category
of a possibility rather
than a probability I would allow the sum of $10,000 only in this regard.
<P>

46   	I believe it is reasonable that the plaintiff should see a
general practitioner once a week. The present cost on an actuarial
basis using
the 5% tables and allowing the plaintiff her life expectancy of 47 years the
sum of $8,538.12 emerges.
<P>

47   	In the light of her symptoms I believe it is reasonable to
allow one and a half visits per year to specialists for the future.
Again,
using the same mode of calculation the sum of $2,903.73 emerges.
<P>

48   	It seems plain that the plaintiff will have to have
physiotherapy treatment. Again using the same mode of calculation and
having
regard to its frequency the sum of $57,690 emerges.
<P>

49   	In the light of the evidence I would allow, again using a
similar basis for calculation, the sum of $12,201.43 for remedial
massage
therapy.
<P>

50   	A claim is made for acupuncture. In the absence of support
for this treatment from Dr Berton and the observations made by
Dr Tarrant and
Professor Jones I would not allow this head. 
<P>

51   	The plaintiff continues to require hydrotherapy and again
using the similar basis of calculation the sum of $36,537 emerges.
<P>

52   	As far as future pharmaceutical expenses are concerned
using a similar calculation based upon the plaintiff's present use
of
medication the sum of $6,297.82 emerges.
<P>

53   	A claim was also made for the cost of a spa bath to assist
the plaintiff in undergoing hydrotherapy. While apparently this
device is
movable (the plaintiff does not own the premises in which she lives), I am of
the view that it would not be reasonable
in the circumstances to allow this
item. The plaintiff can obtain hydrotherapy, as she has in the past, from
facilities which appear
to be readily available and it is for this reason I do
not accept that this is an item which should be the subject of an award of
damages.
<P>

54   	I turn then to the question of future economic loss. This
head of damage is complicated by a number of features.
<P>

1.	There is the shadow of retrenchment to which I have earlier referred.
<P>

2.	Dr Berton has advised that she should undergo bilateral tibial osteotomies.
She would require some three to six months off work.
<P>

3.	She has lost some $26 per week compared to an employee of similar standing
with her employer.
<P>

4.	Her injuries may result in any event in her retiring earlier from the work
force than she otherwise would.
<P>

5.	In any event it may be at some stage in the quite near future her injuries
may result in her undertaking part time work which
would result in her
suffering a loss of income.
<P>

55   	On behalf of the plaintiff submissions were made claiming
that on an actuarial basis the plaintiff should be awarded some
$237,000 for
future economic loss. In view of the massive uncertainty which results from the
factors I have just detailed, I am of
the view that this is not a case where a
mathematically precise mode of calculation can be made. It seems to me that
this is a case
where I should take a global approach. This I do and I award the
sum of $150,000 under this head.
<P>

56   	I tabulate the plaintiff's damages as follows:
<P>

Non-economic loss	136,500.00
<P>

Out-of-pocket expenses	67,490.95
<P>

Past wage loss	32,697.52
<P>

Future medical expenses	164,168.10
<P>

Future economic loss	<u>150,000.00</u>
<P>

	550,856.57
<P>

57   	I shall defer making any orders for judgment or any order
for costs until after the delivery of these reasons. I do this because
I would
wish the parties to check the mathematics involved in the assessment and costs
are always a matter for argument.
