<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 30 August 1996 seeks
an extension of time within which proceedings can be commenced pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> </b>1969 and leave be granted to change
the name of the defendant to Tyre Marketers (Australia) Limited t/as Goodyear
Auto Service Centre.
 The plaintiff relied on the affidavits of Ellis James
Charles Vaughan sworn 16 August 1996 and two affidavits of John Edwin Isaksen
sworn 6 August 1998 and 8 October 1998.  The defendant did not rely on any
affidavit evidence. The defendant opposes the orders sought
in relation to the
extension of the limitation period but raises no objection to the order being
made as to the change of the defendant's
name.  Accordingly I make an order in
accordance with para 4 of the notice of motion.  
<P>

2	The plaintiff was cross examined.  I observed the plaintiff being cross
examined and it is my view that the plaintiff was giving
truthful evidence in a
straight forward manner.
<P>

3	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
<P>

(1)	In 1984 the plaintiff was employed by the defendant.  During the course of
his employment he was required to lift heavy tyres
including tractor tyres that
were filled with water.  There was no mechanical assistance provided to the
plaintiff or other employees
for the purpose of doing so. 
<P>

(2)	On or about 19 August 1985, the plaintiff was lifting tyres when he
suffered an injury to his back.  The plaintiff saw Dr Rogers
and was off work
for a period of two weeks and then returned to normal duties.  On 20 August
1985, he had x-rays taken of his back
and was told that they showed no
abnormalities.  This is borne out by an x-ray report which comments that the
radiographs show a
normal lumbo-sacral spine (Ex B).
<P>

(3)	On or about 27 October 1986, the plaintiff was working alone and again
lifting tyres and suffered a further injury to his back.
 He attended Dr
Rickard Bell for treatment on 27 and 29 October 1986 and was off work for one
week and then returned to his normal
duties.
<P>

(4)	In June 1991, the plaintiff suffered a further injury to his back but did
not take any time off work for this injury.
<P>

(5)	On or about 30 October 1992, whilst lifting tyres the plaintiff suffered a
further injury to his lower back.  He was off work
for one week and then
returned to his to his normal duties.  On 2 November 1992, the plaintiff
attended Dr Rickard Bell who diagnosed
him as having a muscular strain to the
back.  
<P>

(6)	In April 1994, the plaintiff again suffered an injury to his back but did
not take any time off work as a result.
<P>

(7)	In February 1995, the plaintiff suffered a further injury to his lower back
whilst lifting tyres but does not recall having
any time off work for his
injury.
<P>

(8)	Between 1984 and 1994 the plaintiff injured his back 5 times and at most
had taken usually one week but a maximum of 2 weeks
off work after each
accident.  A report by Dr Brown confirmed that he was treated as having a back
or muscular strain in 1985, 1986
and 1992 (Ex B).
<P>

(9)	During the 5 weeks prior to 24 March 1995, the plaintiff was required to
perform extra heavy duties during the course of his
employment which involved
heavy lifting and excessive bending.  On or about 24 March 1995, the plaintiff
suffered a final injury
to his back although there was no specific accident
involved.  He was taken to hospital, had x-rays taken and was given a pethidine
injection.  He has been unable to return to work since.
<P>

(10)	On 27 March 1995, an x-ray of the plaintiff's lumbar spine showed a mild
narrowing of the L4/5 disc space.  On 29 March 1995,
the plaintiff was
suffering from severe low back pain and attended Brook Medical Centre.  
<P>

(11)	On 19 June 1995 the plaintiff first attended the offices of Geoffrey
Edwards and Company solicitors.  He had at that stage
completed and submitted a
claim form to the workers compensation insurer.  On or about 29 June 1995 an
Application for Determination
was issued out of the Compensation Court of New
South Wales.
<P>

(12)	Between 24 March 1995 and December 1995 the plaintiff continued to seek
regular medical treatment from his general practitioner
Dr Brown.  The pain in
his back worsened and started to radiate into his right leg.
<P>

(13)	In August/September 1995 after an MRI scan which demonstrated degenerative
disc at L4/5 with focal right postero-lateral disc
herniation with impingement
on the existing right L5 nerve root.  He was advised by Dr Glass that his
symptoms may settle.  They
did not so he saw Dr Ghabrial in December 1995.
<P>

(14)	From December 1995 to May 1996 the plaintiff's condition deteriorated
markedly.
<P>

(15)	In January 1996 the plaintiff read the medical report of Dr Ghabrial and
it was at that time he understood that his current
physical condition was
related to the incidents at his place of employment during February and March
1995.
<P>

(16)	On 3 May 1996 a statement of claim was filed in the Newcastle registry.
<P>

(17)	On 28 June 1996 an amended statement of claim was filed in the Newcastle
registry.  
<P>

(18)	On 30 August 1996 a notice of motion to extend the limitation period was
filed at Newcastle.
<P>

(19)	On 9 September 1996 Grove J stood this motion over to the next sittings.
Between 7 September and 27 November 1998 directions
were given in Sydney and
the motion was listed for hearing.  
<P>

(20)	On 28 October 1997 Bishop J of the Compensation Court of New South Wales
gave judgment.  He made findings that the plaintiff
received injury to his back
during the course of his employment in August 1995, on 29 October 1986 and due
to the nature and conditions
of his employment from the beginning of February
to 24 March 1995;  the plaintiff had been totally incapacitated since 27 March
1995
and apportioned workers compensation liability by way of 30% to the
workers compensation insurer on risk at the time of the injuries
in 1985 and
1986 and 70% to the workers compensation insurer on risk in 1995.
<P>

4	For the purposes of this application only the defendant agrees that the
plaintiff has established that he has a real case to advance.
 It is also
agreed between the parties that the applicable law is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a> and I of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

5	The plaintiff relies on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(a)(ii)</a> and (iii) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></b>. The approach to be adopted in dealing with applications for extension
of limitation periods is that which has been expounded in
recent times in
<b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR
866</a> and in <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors)</u></b>
(Court of Appeal, unreported, 7 March 1997) and <b><u>Council of the City of
Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (unreported NSWCA, 26 February 1998).  The onus rests
with the applicant.  In addition to the satisfying of the relevant threshold
requirements, it must be shown that it is just and reasonable to make an
order.
<P>

6	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60G</a> empowers the court to extend the limitation period, if it is just
and reasonable to do so, "for such period as it determines".
<P>

7	The relevant provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> are as follows:
<P>

	<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">60H</a> unless it is
satisfied that:</b>
<P>

<b>	  (a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>	  (i)	did not know that personal 	injury had 	been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b>		 (ii)	was unaware of the nature or 			extent of personal injury
suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b>		(iii)	was unaware of the connection 		between the personal injury and
the defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

<b>	at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before
that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;
and</b>
<P>

<b>	(b)	the application is made within three 	years after the plaintiff became
aware 	(or ought to have become aware) of all 	three matters
listed in
paragraph 	(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

8	In cases where it is alleged that, as a result of continuing negligence on
behalf of an employer, the health and well being of
an employee progressively
deteriorates, a new cause of action will accrue from time to time as the worker
suffers further not insignificant
damage to his health and well being - see
<b><u>Dowell Australia Pty Limited v Page</u></b> (Powell JA unreported, Court
of Appeal, 1 December 1995 at pp 16 and 17). for causes of action that arose
between 1986 and 1991.
 Leave is required for causes of action that arose on 19
August 1985, 27 October 1986, June 1991 and 30 October 1992.
<P>

9	Counsel indicated that the plaintiff relied on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(ii)</a> in relation to
the plaintiff's unawareness of nature and extent of his back injury and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60I(a)(iii)</a> in relation to the plaintiff's awareness of acts and omissions
which are referred to in Dr Adams' report.  
<P>

(ii)	<b><u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of the</u></b>
<b><u>nature or extent of the personal injury suffered"</u></b>
<P>

10	The test of knowledge posed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(ii)</a> requires the court to look at
the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither the reasonableness of that
awareness nor constructive
knowledge is an element of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)</a> -
(<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186 CLR 1</a> at pp 9
and 10).  However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(b)</a> imposes an objective test - "became aware (or
ought to have become aware)" of all three matters listed in paragraphs
(a)(i)-(iii).
 The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff "ought to have
known" the nature and extent of his injuries. The defendant referred
me to
<b><u>Thelander v C D Townsend (Eng) Pty Limited &amp; Anor</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20NSWLR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">32 NSWLR
358</a> which I did not find particularly helpful.  
<P>

11	The plaintiff submitted that it was not until he read the report of Dr
Ghabrial in January 1991 that he became aware of the seriousness
of his back
injury.  The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had had radiating leg pain
since 1985 and was aware of the nature
and extent of his back condition.  
<P>

12	The nature and extent of the injury which the plaintiff has sustained is to
be determined as at the date of the hearing of the
application
(<b><u>Harris</u></b> ibid pp 13 and 14).  A plaintiff may be held to have been
aware of the nature or extent of his injury within the relevant period
if
during that period he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having
upon him and of its likely future course, even
though he may have been unaware
of the precise pathology or medical diagnosis.  On the other hand, knowledge of
the medical diagnosis
will not itself amount to knowledge of the nature and
extent of the injury if the plaintiff is unaware of significant aspects of
the
prognosis, for example that the injury is permanent and will not be amenable to
treatment;  or that it may deteriorate with the
passage of time.  As long as
the consequences are of a kind that the plaintiff expects, the plaintiff will
be aware of the extent
of the injury.
<P>

13	I turn now to examine the plaintiff's awareness of the nature and extent of
the personal injury suffered.  The plaintiff was
treated by his general
practitioner for back strain or muscle strain in relation to the accidents
which occurred on 19 August 1985,
27 October 1986, June 1991 and 30 October
1992.  At these times the plaintiff understood that he was suffering from a
muscle strain
which would resolve itself within a few weeks.  Each time he
suffered back pain he had a week or two off work.  Each time the plaintiff
returned to work he carried out heavy duties and had no reason to believe that
his injuries had caused permanent damage to his back.
<P>

14	On 24 March 1995, the plaintiff suffered a final injury to his back although
no specific accident was involved.  Since then the
plaintiff has been
experiencing severe low back pain.  In April and May 1995 the plaintiff
complained that the low back pain radiated
into his right leg.  In cross
examination the plaintiff admitted that he experienced pain in 1985, it
occurred with the back injury
and it cleared up within a week or two of the
accident.  Even in September 1995, the plaintiff was told by Dr Glass that the
symptoms
might settle.  It was from December 1995 to May 1996 that the
plaintiff says that his condition deteriorated markedly.
<P>

15	Dr Ghabrial, Director of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Royal
Newcastle hospital in his report dated 15 May 1996 opined:
<P>

	<b>"Mr Vaughan sustained an injury to his back at work on the 27th March 1995
as the result of heavy work over a 5 weeks period when
he was undertaking more
work due to the absence of the manager and another employee involving a great
deal of lifting and bending.
 Clinical assessment and investigations suggested
a markedly prolapsed disc at the L4/5 disc with compression on the right L5
nerve
root.  There is no doubt that his condition has deteriorated since I saw
him last 6 months ago with increased weakness in his left
foot and
deterioration of his straight leg raising and tension signs.</b>
<P>

<b>	It is likely that Mr Vaughan will come to surgical intervention for his
prolapsed L4/5 disc.  However he is not fit for any type
of work at that stage
and is likely to remain restricted indefinitely from any activities involving
heavy lifting and excessive bending
as well as sitting or standing for lengthy
periods.</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>	From the history given to me by Mr Vaughan, it is likely that his present
clinical features, residual disabilities and permanent
impairment are related
to the activities undertaken around February/March 1995 aggravating his
pre-existing lower back problem which
remained without any real restriction to
his life or activities from 1985 until the prolapse sustained around
February/March 1995."</b>
<P>

16	While the plaintiff would have become aware that his back condition had
deteriorated when he could not return to work a few weeks
after the March 1995
incident, it is my view that he was unaware that his back condition was serious
enough to warrant surgical intervention
at that 
<P>

time.  It would have been in the months after March 1995 that the plaintiff
would have gradually realised that his back condition
had deteriorated and may
permanently restrict him from performing activities that involved heavy lifting
and excessive bending as
well as sitting or standing for lengthy periods.
<P>

17	It is my view that the plaintiff was unaware of the extent of his back
injury until at the earliest September 1995 when he realised
he may have to
undergo surgery.  It was at this time that he was made aware that his
disabilities were related to work he undertook
in 1985.  This falls within the
time period stipulated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(b).</a>
<P>

(iii)	<b><u>Whether the plaintiff was unaware of the connection between
</u></b>	<b><u>personal injury and the defendant's act or omission</u></b>
<P>

18	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> is concerned with ignorance of the existence of acts
and omissions rather than legal conclusions.  The acts or omissions referred
to
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> are the acts or omissions on which the plaintiff relies to
found the cause of action referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G.</a>  Those acts or omissions, will
be found in the plaintiff's particulars of negligence.  -  <b><u>Drayton Coal
Board Pty Limited v Drain</u></b> (Court of Appeal, Gleeson CJ, unreported 22
August 1995).
<P>

19	The plaintiff submitted that he was unaware of the connection between the
personal injury and the defendant's acts or omissions
until Dr Adams' report
was obtained.  The report is dated 14 August 1996.  There is no evidence that
the plaintiff has actually read
Dr Adams' report or been 
<P>

told of its contents, nor is there any evidence to show that the plaintiff was
unaware of the connection between personal injury
and the defendants act or
omissions.   Thus the plaintiff's case under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> fails.
<P>

20	As the plaintiff has passed through the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(ii)</a> gateway, I turn to
consider whether it is just and reasonable to extent the limitation period.
In <b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J referred to the effects of delay in the now
often quoted passage which states:
<P>

	<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Second, it is
oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long
after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Third,
people
should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on the
basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>and;
<P>

	<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.</b>
<P>

<b>	In such a situation, actual injustice to one party must occur.  It seems
more in accord with the legislative policy underlying limitation
periods that
the plaintiff's lost right should not be revived that that the defendant should
have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>and;
<P>

<b>	The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question: Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires an
extension."</b>
<P>

21	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

<b>	"The applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant prejudice
to the prospective
defendant."</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>and;
<P>

	<b>"The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised
in favour of an applicant lies on the applicant.  To discharge
that onus the
applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant
prejudice to the prospective
defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a
limitation period, to allow
the commencement of an action outside that period
is  prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the
benefit
of the limitation."</b>
<P>

22	In <b><u>The Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (Court of
Appeal, 3 September 1997, unreported) the Court of Appeal considered the effect
of <b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to the extension of the limitation period
of a case which falls into subdivision 2 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60E(1)(b)</a> specifically refers to "the extent to which, having
regard to the delay, there is or may be prejudice to the defendant by reason
that evidence that would have been available if the proceedings had been
commenced within the limitation period is no longer available".
 By majority
)Mason P and Powell JA) held in <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> that the trial judge
erred by weighing up competing interest of the plaintiff and defendant which
meant that the plaintiff was ultimately
relieved of the persuasive burden which
is placed on the plaintiff.
<P>

23	Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  The President quoted the passage by McHugh J
which begins "Legislatures enact" and was of the view that Dawson J agreed with
McHugh J.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that Dawson J and
McHugh JA appeared to indicate that it is mandatory
that the applicant negate
"significant prejudice" before the discretion could be exercised in his or her
favour. 
<P>

24	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed themselves in the
following terms.
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

25	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the notion of
"significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances of a fair
trial unlikely" but concluded that the views of the judges in
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> represented a clear indication that mere proof of actual
prejudice will not dictate a rejection of an application to extend time.
 Mason
P then expressed respectful approval and agreement with the following statement
of Kirby J in <b><u>Taylor</u></b>.
<P>

	<b>"Although attempts have been made to spell out the criteria to be taken
into account in judging whether or not an order extending
time should be made,
care must be taken in the use of such criteria because of the different
expression of the relevant provisions
of limitation statutes.  Furthermore, the
factual circumstances of cases are infinitely various.  The discretion
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31(2)</a> of the [Queensland] Act is controlled only by the terms of
the Act and the achievement of its purposes, as elaborated above."</b>
<P>

26	In determining whether it is just and reasonable to extend the limitation
period in this application I will examine whether the
delay has made "the
chances of a fair trial unlikely" or whether the defendant would suffer
"significant prejudice".
<P>

27	The defendant submitted that it has been prejudiced as it is 13 years since
the first accident occurred and witnesses' memories
have faded and that if an
extension of time were not granted in relation to the pre 1995 accidents, the
plaintiff could still proceed
with the 1995 cause of action.
<P>

28	I accept that the defendant will suffer presumptive prejudice as it is 13
years since the first accident occurred.  The plaintiff
gave evidence that
after each accident he reported it to his employer and it was written down in a
book.  From 1984 to 1995 there
were the same number of employees, 5 or 6.  Over
that period there were no changes in the work done or the manner in which it
was
performed.  The employees of the defendant over this period were Barry
Moody, the manager who worked with the defendant for the period
referred to
above.  While he no longer works for the defendant, he resides in Muswellbrook.
Two fellow employees who worked closely
with the plaintiff were Jeff Eade and
Tony Budden.  Tony Budden was employed by the defendant from 1984 until 1995.
Although they
no longer work for the defendant they still reside in
Muswellbrook.  Mr Budden works at the BP petrol station and Mr Eade works at
the golf course.  The plaintiff does not know the whereabouts of Jeremy Bird
but he was only there for about 3 years.  The secretary
for most of this time
was Miss Sue Oates and while she no longer works for the defendant she still
resides in Muswellbrook.
<P>

29	The plaintiff received compensation payments when he was off work after some
of the accidents and the accidents have been the
subject of litigation in the
compensation court.  As there are witnesses available to give evidence and
documentation concerning
the plaintiff's accidents available, it is my view
that the plaintiff's chances of a fair trial are not unlikely.  I am also of
the
view that the defendant will not suffer significant prejudice.  The
plaintiff has discharged his onus and I am satisfied that it
is just and
reasonable that an order be made that he be granted an extension of the
limitation period.  The plaintiff has asked for
an indulgence of the court.
However the plaintiff submitted that costs be costs in the cause as it was the
nature of the plaintiff's
back condition that caused the application to be
made.  The defendant submitted that the plaintiff should pay the costs.  The
delay
in commencing proceedings was primarily because of the plaintiff's back
condition deteriorating in 1995.  In these circumstances
the appropriate order
is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

30	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings for damages in respect of injuries sustained
by him on 19 August
1985, 27 October 1986, June 1991 and 30 October 1992 up to and including 28
June 1996.
<P>

(2)	Order in accordance with paragraph 4 of the plaintiff's notice of motion
filed 30 August 1996.
<P>

(3)	Costs be costs in the cause.
