<P>

TUESDAY 12 OCTOBER 1999
<P>

<u>10365/1996</u>	<u>STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LIMITED v KERRY GRETTON
KERSWELL &amp; ANOR</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced in January 1996.  In the
Statement of Claim, the plaintiff sought inter alia possession of
a property
known as 94 Mona Vale Road Pymble (the property) and a monetary judgment.
<P>

2  	There have been two summary judgment applications.  In July 1996,
the plaintiff obtained summary judgment in respect of its
claim for possession
of the property.  A later summary judgment application in respect of the
monetary claim was unsuccessful.
<P>

3  	The property was sold by the first mortgagee.  There were no
proceeds available to satisfy any part of the plaintiff's monetary
claim.
<P>

4  	The present dispute between the parties is restricted to the
monetary claim.  The defendants say that they are not liable for
at least part
of that claim (it is said that a company K G &amp; S A Kerswell Pty Ltd had the
liability for the rest of the claim).
<P>

5  	This company was used in the conduct of a strata management
business.  The defendants were directors of that company.  There
was also
another company (National Strata Management Pty Ltd).
<P>

6  	The dispute concerns two accounts with the plaintiff.  The first
account was opened in December 1988 and was numbered 53002
- 00.  The second
was opened on 15 November 1989 and was numbered 53002 - 16.  The first account
was opened as a cheque or current
account.  It later became an overdraft
account.  The second account was opened for the purposes of a term loan
facility.  An advance
of $38,000 was made.  A second mortgage was given over
the property.  It contained an all moneys clause.
<P>

7  	Generally speaking, both accounts had a troubled history (by at
least early 1990).  The company was deregistered on 27 February
1992.  The two
accounts were amalgamated on 16 March 1993.  The debt standing in the second
account was transferred to the first
account.  Thereafter, there was one
account which continued under the number of the first account.
<P>

8  	The hearing commenced on 21 September 1999 and occupied three
days.  The plaintiff read three affidavits (the deponents were
Messrs Egan,
Hanrahan &amp; McCarthy).  Mr McCarthy gave supplementary oral evidence and was
cross-examined.  Each of the defendants
has sworn an affidavit.  Both of them
gave supplementary oral evidence and were cross-examined.  Both parties
tendered documentary
material.
<P>

9  	Before seeking to deal with other matters, I should digress at
this stage to deal with one matter that cropped up during the
trial.  The
plaintiff moved for dismissal of a claim for damages contained in a Cross-claim
brought by the defendants.  The claim
for damages was mixed in nature being a
combination apparently founded upon allegations of representations and failure
to inform.
 The pleading was somewhat confusing and deficient in a number of
respects.  Apart from these problems, there were insurmountable
evidentiary
deficiencies.  As the claim was clearly hopeless and doomed to failure, I
granted the application for dismissal.  The
alternative would have led to the
wasting of court time and a needless throwing away of costs.  It seemed to me
that the interests
of justice were best served by the granting of the
application.
<P>

10  	In 1988, the defendants had banking arrangements with Westpac
Banking Corporation (Westpac).  Statements were sent to "The
Secretary - K G
&amp; S A Kerswell" and the account stood in the name of "K G &amp; S A
Kerswell Pty Ltd Strata Management".  There
were also separate strata
management accounts.  It is said that the defendants were unhappy with the
services provided by Westpac.
 An approach was made to the plaintiff.  The
defendants say that two conversations were had with officers of the plaintiff
(including
one officer who was understood to be the manager).
<P>

11  	Paragraph 7 of the first defendant's affidavit deposes to the
first conversation in the following terms:-
<P>

"In or about December, 1988 I approached the State Bank (`The Bank') at its
branch at 235 Clarence Street, Sydney with a view to
doing all my banking with
them and I spoke to an officer of the State Bank who I understood to be the
manager of the branch, regarding
the transfer of the Strata Management accounts
and the other accounts from Westpac to the State Bank and generally about
financial
facilities that my business could expect to obtain.  I recall having
a conversation with this bank officer as follows:-
<P>

I said		`I operate a Strata Management company 
<P>

KG &amp; SA Kerswell Pty Limited.  We have approximately 60 Strata Management
accounts in our portfolio.  We have a couple of very
large managements such as
the Neutral Bay Shopping Village and Pacific Towers in Coffs Harbour.  A number
of the accounts have relatively
big budgets and they normally operate through a
cheque account.  As a result a bank with these types of accounts can do quite
well
because interest is not paid and normal bank charges are applied.
Currently we are banking with Westpac but we're unhappy with their
service and
procedures.  They don't know how to look after us.  We are also looking for  a
facility from the bank to pay out a company
loan from Westpac in due course.  I
am able to start an account with you by depositing $30,000.00.  We want to use
this account for
company purposes'.
<P>

The Bank
<P>

Officer
<P>

Said:		`That sounds good I'm sure the bank can 
<P>

service your needs'."
<P>

Paragraph 8 of that affidavit deposes to the second conversation in the
following terms:-
<P>

"On or about 21st December, 1988 I again attended the bank and spoke to a bank
officer as follows:
<P>

I said		`I have made arrangements with the manager
<P>

to open a cheque account for my business at this branch and I would like to
deposit a cheque for $30,000.00 into it and also collect
a temporary cheque
book'.
<P>

The bank officer then proceeded to open the cheque Account No:  53-0002-00
(`Company Account No. 1') and handed me a number of temporary
cheques which
could be used until a proper printed cheque book was provided."
<P>

12  	The first account was opened and operated from 21 December 1988.
It appears to have always stood in the name of the defendants.
 The second
account was opened and operated in the names of the defendants.  It is conceded
that the defendants have personal liability
in respect of that account (by
reason of the personal covenants contained in the mortgage).
<P>

13  	By the time of the amalgamation of the two accounts, the company
had ceased to be a legal entity (it had been dissolved under
the Corporations
Law).  An approach was made to the plaintiff to amalgamate the accounts.  There
was a letter signed by the first
defendant.  It had a letterhead (New South
Wales Strata Management Pty Ltd).  The plaintiff responded with a letter
directed to the
defendants.  It is contained in Exhibit LAMC 1 (see page 110).
The letter refers to the representations made by the defendants. 
It set out an
approach which the plaintiff said that it was prepared to consider.  The
approach identified the present balance outstanding
in respect of the
amalgamated account (and stipulates an amount of interest to be paid).  There
was to be a forbearance of legal
action for a period of six months.  The
defendants assented to that approach and the amalgamation then took place.  The
amount of
interest was paid.  The amalgamated account was thereafter operated
by the defendants (inter alia there were two deposits from personal
funds).
There was a history of default and contemplated legal action.  As open offers
of settlement did not produce a resolution,
these proceedings were then
commenced.
<P>

14  	This is a case in which credibility has been seen as a question
of some importance.  I have closely observed the demeanour
of witnesses during
the giving of evidence.  In assessing credibility, I have had regard to both
demeanour and evidence.  The credibility
of the defendants has been seen as
crucial to their case.
<P>

15  	The first defendant can be described as a very unimpressive
witness.  His affidavit contains statements that were untrue. 
There was
material which could be seen as standing in conflict with what had been said by
his wife.  His oral evidence stood in conflict
with what had been said in his
affidavit.  It was in conflict with things said and done in the past (including
what appeared from
documentation).  He made implausible and/or unpersuasive
attempts to explain away the inconsistencies between the present case and
what
had been done in the past.  He persisted with a practice of giving unresponsive
answers to questions.  There was a contrast
in manner when answering questions
which he thought would assist his case as opposed to those which sought an
answer that he did
not see as assisting his case.
<P>

16  	The second defendant was also an unimpressive witness.  The
defendants place significance on the evidence given by them concerning
the two
conversations that they allege took place in or about December 1988 prior to
the opening of the first account.  Their affidavits
had been sworn in December
1996.  They  had been prepared with the assistance of counsel.  The second
defendant's affidavit made
no reference to the first of the two conversations.
She gave oral evidence by leave as to that conversation.  This evidence first
emerged during the hearing.  There was no satisfactory explanation for it not
appearing in the affidavit.  Her affidavit gave evidence
as to the second of
the two alleged conversations.  What appeared in the affidavit could be seen to
be in conflict with the version
given by the first defendant as to this
conversation.  In her affidavit she deposes to her being the person who spoke
to the bank
officer.  By leave, she gave oral evidence to the effect that this
was an error and that it was her husband who had spoken to the
bank officer in
those terms.  This was the version that had appeared in the husband's
affidavit.  However, during cross-examination
her evidence changed once again
and she retreated to the position where she didn't remember which of them had
spoken to the bank
officer.
<P>

17  	In their affidavits the defendants did not identify either of
the officers with whom it is said that a conversation took place.
 However,
some years later in their oral evidence both defendants said that they were
able to identify Mr Seymour (as the bank officer
they had understood to be the
manager).
<P>

18  	Mr Seymour was not called by either party.  He is no longer an
employee of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff had provided the defendants
with his
last known address.  There was some conflicting and inconclusive argument
concerning the fact that he was not called.
<P>

19  	I do not regard either of the defendants as a reliable or
credible witness.  In the absence of independent corroboration I
do not accept
their evidence.
<P>

20  	The issue identified between the parties was said to be who was
the customer of the plaintiff.  In resisting the finding that
it was the
defendants themselves, the defendants put stress on certain matters (inter alia
the two alleged conversations which have
been earlier referred to, certain
aspects of the documentation and the fact that moneys payable to the company
were deposited).
<P>

21  	Some relevant documentation is no longer available.  The
plaintiff does not have documentation relating to the opening of the
first
account, some statements as to account balances or any cheques.  The defendants
have tendered certain deposit books used by
them.  They have not produced any
cheque butts.  The deposit books suggest that deposits of both personal and
company moneys were
made.  As I read the affidavits of the defendants, I do not
understand them to be asserting that the initial deposit of $30,000 was
by way
of cheque payable to the company.
<P>

22  	I do not accept the evidence given by the defendants as to the
two conversations allegedly had in or about December 1988. 
However, it seems
to me that it matters little whether or not a different view was taken as to
that evidence.  It must be remembered
that the conversations were allegedly had
with different bank officers and that there was a temporal interlude between
them.  In
the first of the alleged conversations the expression "for company
purposes" appears.  In the second of the alleged conversations
a different
expression "for my business at this branch" appears.  Apart from the lack of
consistency in terminology, it seems to
me that the content of these alleged
conversations falls short of establishing what is contended by the defendants.
The first of
the alleged conversations was of a preliminary nature.  It was the
second that was followed by the opening of the account.  Whatever
can be
extracted from this material, the fact remains that it does not accord with
documentary material relating to the accounts.
 The documentation evidences
that the accounts always stood in the names of the defendants themselves.  At
the very least, it seems
unlikely that an account would have been opened in
personal names with the deposit of a company cheque.  Further, it would seem
unlikely
that both of these defendants would have allowed the account to be
opened in their personal names if they had in fact wanted to open
a company
account.  I should add that it seems to me to be of little moment that the
defendants used the account for both personal
and company deposits.
<P>

23  	There is no evidence to suggest that the defendants, at any
stage, ever sought to have either of the accounts placed in the
name of the
company.  There could be no misunderstanding that the plaintiff treated the two
accounts as being personal accounts.
 Consistently with this approach the
accounts were not sought to be secured by way of guarantee from the directors.
An application
was made for the opening of an account in the name of the
company.  This was an account to provide an overdraft with a limit of $15,000.
Approval was given but later cancelled.  This may have been at least in part
due to the fact that the plaintiff required guarantees
from the defendants
which were not forthcoming.
<P>

24  	In the past, various admissions have been made by or on behalf
of the defendants which are contrary to the case presented in
this Court.
There are admissions to the effect that both accounts were personal accounts.
There are admissions to the effect that
the first account was a personal
account.  There is documentation from both the defendants and their solicitors
which evidences that
the second account was a personal account.  Admissions
have been made in pleadings.  Admissions have been made in evidence given
by
the first defendant before Master Greenwood.  The judgment for possession made
by him was founded on an admission of personal
indebtedness and of default
under the mortgage.  There were admissions arising from conduct of the
defendants following receipt of
notices served in 1991.  There have been open
offers to settle the proceedings.  The assertion that the first account was a
company
account was not made in those proceedings until after the second of the
two summary judgment applications.
<P>

25  	The plaintiff also contends that the defendant is estopped from
asserting that the first account is a company account.  The
estoppel is said to
arise from the judgment of Master Greenwood delivered in July 1996.  Competing
submissions were made on this
argument.  There may well be considerable force
in the plaintiff's contention.  However, for present purposes, it is
unnecessary
to pursue this matter.
<P>

26  	I am satisfied that, both accounts were at all times personal
accounts.  Even if a different view had been taken on these matters,
once the
company had been deregistered changed contractual relationships would have come
into being with the continuing conduct of
both accounts.  There was a change in
the contractual relationship when the amalgamation of the accounts took place.
The changed
contractual relationships had to be between the plaintiff and the
defendants.
<P>

27  	The plaintiff is entitled to judgment against both defendants.
The balance of the Cross-claim is dismissed.  The defendants
are to pay the
costs of the proceedings and of the Cross-claim.  The exhibits may be
returned.
