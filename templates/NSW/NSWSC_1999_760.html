COMMON LAW DIVISION

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 29 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>20101/1999</u>	<u>DRAGO JAMBRECINA v PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY (IN
LIQUIDATION) &amp; ANOR.</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on
19 March 1999.  The process seeks to propound inter alia a monetary
claim for
loss and damage.  There are two named defendants.
<P>

2  	On 17 September 1987, the plaintiff gave a mortgage to Combined
Mortgage Services Pty Limited over a number of properties. 
It secured a loan
in the sum of $458,800.00.  Combined Mortgage Services Pty limited subsequently
changed its name to Farrow Mortgage
Services Pty Limited (it is the second
named defendant).  It later assigned the benefit of the mortgage to the first
named defendant.
<P>

3  	In or about December 1990, default was made under the mortgage.
This led to the first defendant bringing proceedings 10647 of
1992 (the earlier
proceedings).  The proceedings were brought by Summons and inter alia the
possession of certain property was sought.
 The proceedings were brought
against both the plaintiff in these proceedings and his wife.  Affidavits were
sworn and filed on behalf
of all parties (including affidavits which raise some
of the complaints made by the plaintiff in these proceedings).  The proceedings
were settled.  Short Minutes of Order were prepared (dated 17 December 1992).
Subsequently, a judgment was entered on 2 March 1993.
 The judgment gave inter
alia possession to certain properties.
<P>

4  	On 19 March 1999, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion.  As the
defendants have been in liquidation for many years, it seeks
an order for leave
to sue the defendants.  On 27 April 1999, the defendants filed a Notice of
Motion.  It seeks either summary dismissal
of the proceedings or the striking
out of the Statement of Claim.
<P>

5  	The hearing took place on 13 July 1999.  The plaintiff appeared
in person.  The defendants were represented by counsel.
<P>

6  	The evidence consisted of an affidavit sworn by the plaintiff, an
affidavit sworn on behalf of the defendants (by Brigitte Sandra
Markovic) and
documentation tendered by the parties.
<P>

7  	The parties have prepared written submissions.  The writing was
supplemented by oral argument.
<P>

8  	On behalf of the defendants, the approach is taken that unless a
case for relief is demonstrated by them leave should be given
to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was uncertain as to the source of power for the relief sought by
him.  The defendants have assumed
that he was relying on s 471B of the
<u>Corporations Law</u>.  Ultimately, the parties proceeded on the basis that
the application was being made pursuant to that provision.
<P>

9  	At this stage it is convenient to look at the plaintiff's
originating process.  The Statement of Claim itself is in the following
terms:-
<P>

"1.	Plaintiff and Defendant had signed a mortgage document (real property ACT
1900) on the 17th of September 1987 in Queanbeyan
NSW. Between the late 1990
and the late 1993, the defendant had breached agreements with in a document on
many occasions in many
ways.
<P>

	PARTICULARS of pleading are set out in additional documents attached.
<P>

THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS:
<P>

			1.	Relief sort:
<P>

	- DAMAGES
<P>

		- INTEREST UNDER SECTION 94
<P>

		- COSTS"
<P>

10  	The documentation filed by the plaintiff consisted of the
Statement of Claim together with an annexed number of pages which
have the
heading "Particulars of Statement of Claim".  The particulars contain material
which could be expected to be found in the
Statement of Claim itself.  The
particulars make reference to other annexed documentation.  This documentation
was not actually filed
with the originating process.  A copy of that
documentation was tendered and became Exhibit A.
<P>

11  	The defendants make a substantial attack on the form of the
Statement of Claim.  For present purposes, it is unnecessary to
embark on a
detailed consideration of the alleged pleading defects.
<P>

12  	As a pleading, it is grossly deficient and it would not be a
productive exercise to require a party to plead to it.
<P>

13  	It falls well short of complying with the pleading rules (see
Pt. 15 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</u> 1970</a>).  The Statement of Claim itself
is largely incomprehensible.  To the extent that there is any real allegation
of material facts,
these are to be found in the particulars.  The material is
confusing and in some instances incomprehensible.  If this material was
to be
looked at as a pleading, it is embarrassing.  It would not be capable of
achieving one of the objects of pleading (to define
and narrow issues).
However, it is well established that a party is not required to plead to
particulars.
<P>

14  	For the assistance of the plaintiff, I should make specific
reference of one area of confusion.  The originating process appears
to be
intended to propound a number of complaints.  There is confusion as to whether
the complaints are founded on the mortgage or
contractual arrangements
(including the earlier loan agreement).  The loan arrangements were made with
the second defendant.  Any
breach of the terms and conditions of the mortgage
could have been expected to be levelled against the first defendant.  It is
unclear
as to which of the defendants is the object of each of the various
complaints made by the plaintiff.
<P>

15  	Whilst the Court has sympathy for the predicament of the
plaintiff (he has informed the Court that he cannot afford to employ
legal
representation), it is important that there be compliance with the Rules of
Court.  If they are not complied with, there may
be injustice to other parties
and the Court will not be in a position to dispatch its business with due
expedition.  It needs to
be emphasised that the rules are applicable to all
parties.
<P>

16  	It seems to me clear that the defendants are entitled to have
the existing process struck out.  The question that troubles
me is whether or
not the plaintiff should be given a further opportunity to file amended
process.
<P>

17  	The defendants contend that the proceedings should be summarily
dismissed because they are doomed to failure.  This contention
is founded on a
number of grounds.  It is said that all of the complaints are now statute
barred.  Further, it is said that they
are liable to be defeated by the
principles of res judicata, issue estoppel and what was decided in <u>Port of
Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589.</a>
<P>

18  	There may well be real questions as to whether the complaints or
any of them give rise to a cause of action maintainable at
law.  Those which
are founded on contract are clearly statute barred.  Those which are founded on
the mortgage may still be maintainable.
<P>

19  	At least in some respects, there may be force in the submissions
founded on estoppel and/or abuse of process.  However, I should
mention that
the earlier proceedings concerned a claim for possession made by the first
defendant and the plaintiff now wishes to
advance monetary claims.  Also, I
should mention that the second defendant was not a party to those
proceedings.
<P>

20  	In the light of the deficiencies of the original process, the
Court is confronted with the problem of an inadequate definition
of the claims
which the plaintiff desires to propound.  Because of the confusion, it seems to
me to be unsafe to proceed to make
any summary determination on the contentions
advanced by the defendants.  It seems to me, that this is better done after the
plaintiff
has been given a further opportunity to plead his case.  However, the
plaintiff would be well advised to proceed on the basis that
this may be his
last opportunity to present the case he wishes to propound.
<P>

21  	The Statement of Claim is struck out.  The plaintiff is to have
leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim.  Any Amended Statement
of Claim is
to be filed within 28 days.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
defendants' Notice of Motion to date.  The balance
of that Notice of Motion and
the plaintiff's Notice of Motion are stood over generally.  The parties may
have liberty to restore
on 21 days' notice.
