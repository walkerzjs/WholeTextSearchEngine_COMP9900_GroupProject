<b>3070/99		ORACAL INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD &amp; ANOR v INTERNATIONAL
PROFESSIONAL TRADERS PTY LIMITED &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiffs claim that the defendant have
breached duties of confidentiality by carrying on the business of
selling
computers to Tandy Electronics a leading retailer of electronic goods.  By
their Notice of Motion of 8 July 1999 the plaintiffs
claimed an interlocutory
injunction and other controls over the defendants' conduct.  On 22 July 1999 I
dismissed that application,
and now state my reasons.
<P>

2  	The first defendants trade under the firm name Datcom Computers,
and the second and third defendants are the principals in the
firm's affairs.
Mr Jalal Sayed (known as Jay) is the director of the first of the Datcom
companies and Mr Sammy Sayed is employed
by it as manager.  An interlocutory
application is not an occasion for disposing finally of disputed issues and my
statements about
the facts in these reasons should be so understood.  The
plaintiff is an importer and distributor of telecommunications products
including cordless telephones, and for some time before March 1999 supplied
cordless telephones branded "Eagle" and accessories to
Tandy.  In March 1999 Mr
Basker Joseph who is Tandy's senior buyer approached Mr Magafa, who is the
principal of Oracal, and initiated
business for a supply of computers.  Oracal
did not then deal in computers but early in March 1999 Datcom Computers
installed some
office computers in Oracal's sales and administration office at
Belmore.  In a series of conversations Mr Magafa arranged with Mr
Jay Sayed for
a supply of a range of computers to Tandy, and this led Mr Magafa to introduce
Mr Sayed to Mr Joseph.  In conversations
with Mr Joseph arrangements were made
for a range of computers at a variety of the prices to be obtained and
delivered to Tandy;
discussion settled on four models and on wholesale prices
to Tandy for these.  The computers were to be branded "Eagle".  Some practical
arrangements were made for handling orders.  Tandy was to give orders to
Oracal, and only Oracal would be entitled to payment by
Tandy.  Oracal would
arrange delivery within two days of receipt of the order.  Mr Magafa came to
arrangements with Mr Jay Sayed
to the effect that Mr Magafa would arrange the
orders from Tandy, fax them to Datcom, Datcom would deliver the computers to
Tandy
and the profits would be shared 50-50.  In this arrangement Datcom was to
invoice Oracal at wholesale prices for the computers and
could only look to
Oracal for payment.  
<P>

3  	Negotiations about the terms of a long-term arrangement continued
in various forms but no agreement was ever reached.  The positions
taken on one
side and the other in a draft agreement and in letters stipulating negotiating
positions do not establish obligations
of the parties.
<P>

4  	Relations between Datcom and Oracal were at two different levels.
The computers were sold by Datcom to Oracal, giving rise to
obligations to pay
prices and to the ordinary flow of commercial documents, that is invoices and
claims for payment.  There was however
another level at which there was at
least some element of a joint-venture, shared-venture or partnership, in that
the profits of
the dealings were to be shared equally.  It was the plaintiffs'
case that the defendants have appropriated for their own benefit
a business
opportunity which was the subject of the joint venture, and that in so doing
they are in breach of fiduciary obligations
and duties of good faith.
<P>

5  	Payment by Oracal to Datcom for the computers sold was a basic
practical necessity for the existence and continuation of the
second
relationship.  Datcom Computers had to obtain supply, from other suppliers and
by assembly and manufacture of its own, and
the business could not take place
and the flow could not continue unless the goods were paid for by Oracal.
Datcom had no contractual
relationship with Tandy and no access to the payments
from Tandy to Oracal.
<P>

6  	There was no formal expression of the arrangement at either
level.  In point of fact there were no express arrangements establishing
how
long either relationship was to continue, or establishing any need to give
notice before withdrawing from it.  There was no express
arrangement dealing
with confidentiality in the introduction of Tandy's business or with
confidentiality of knowledge relating to
Tandy's needs, and there was no
arrangement however informal on the subject of restricting Datcom from dealing
with Tandy or with
any other person to whom Datacom could sell computers.
<P>

7  	In my judgment Oracal has very poor prospects of establishing
that there was a fiduciary relationship between Oracal and Datcom
in relation
to any transactions other than those which actually took place.  It was only to
those that the arrangement for profit
sharing applied, there was no contractual
undertaking or informal arrangement that transactions would continue, and there
was no
reason why it would be a breach of faith for either party to withdraw at
any time and thenceforward to decline to continue the relationship
but act in
its own interests solely.
<P>

8  	It is necessary to define the scope of activities to which the
joint venture related in order to test whether some conduct of
a party to it is
a departure from the joint venture or a breach of any fiduciary obligation
arising from it.  Where there was no
obligation to continue to participate in
the venture, and the venture did not extend to any transactions other than
those in which
the parties chose to participate, it cannot be said that there
has been breach of any duty of good faith by desisting from participating
and
carrying on business in some other way.  
<P>

9  	The continuance of the negotiations and their inconclusive
outcome assist in demonstrating the limited nature of the venture
and of the
obligations associated with it.
<P>

10  	The arrangements were acted on in a number of sales in March,
April and May 1999.  By May Datcom expressed dissatisfaction
with the rate at
which payments were being received.  Communications between the parties were
inconclusive in establishing the plaintiffs'
position about Datcom's
entitlement.  Even at the hearing the plaintiffs did not put forward and
disclaimed the need to put forward
any ascertainable position about what sums
were payable to Datcom, when payment should be made and would be made, what
parts of Datcom's
claim for payment were disputed, and on what grounds.  By the
time of the hearing Datcom's detailed reconciliation of the account
and
assertions about its claim for payment had been before the plaintiffs for many
weeks, but the plaintiffs had not adhered to any
clear or identifiable
position.  The evidence given by the plaintiffs did not establish any reason
for difficulty in stating what
difficulties or matter of dispute there are
about the defendants' claims, or in making payments.  On the facts it is highly
probable
that significant sums of money are long overdue for payment to Datcom.
The defendants' reconciliation figures include claims for
expenses which are
allowable to it only under the profit sharing arrangement and go beyond simple
claims for payment for sales of
goods.
<P>

11  	Continuance of payments to Datcom would be an essential part of
sincere adherence by Oracal to the venture; as otherwise it
would soon become
distorted, and indeed it appears to me that it did become distorted, into an
arrangement in which Datcom supplied
goods of significant value over an
extended period and was not paid, while Oracal received payments for the goods
without having
given value.  A distorted arrangement like that has no real
claim to equitable protection.
<P>

12  	At a relatively late stage in the transactions the second
plaintiff OICP Pty Ltd was introduced into the parties' relationship
as the
company which was to stand between Datcom and Tandy as purchaser from Datcom
and seller to Tandy.  The object was to give
Datcom, one of the principals of
which became one of the two directors of OICP, some control over the flow of
funds received from
Tandy.  Its introduction had little effect on events as
very few or possibly no transactions were actually conducted through it.
OICP's part was not as a principal but as an integer or means for facilitating
the relations between the principals which already
existed.  The presence of
OICP as a company and the fact that one of the defendants held office as a
director in it gave some colour
to a claim against that director and those
associated with him based on breach of fiduciary duty towards OICP; but it
appears to
me that there is no real prospect of relief being granted on that
basis, as OICP's role was no more than as an integer and it never
became the
principal to whom fiduciary duties were owed.
<P>

13  	In June 1999, when Datcom's dissatisfaction appears to have been
complete and it had not received either payment or any clear
response to its
reconciliation and assertions about what was due to it, Datcom began dealing
directly with Tandy for the supply of
computers.  It is those direct dealings
which the plaintiffs seek to restrain in those proceedings.
<P>

14  	It appears clearly on the evidence that the plaintiffs are not
in the position to say that their relationship with the defendants
was
conducted in a regular way, or that the defendants' rights with respect to
payment for the supply of computers was respected,
or that entitlements to open
dealing and a clear acknowledgment of their position in a joint venture were
accorded to the defendants.
 The defendants' ability to continue the
relationship and to comply with any fiduciary duties which they may have
incurred is interdependent
with compliance with the plaintiffs' obligations to
make payments to the defendants.  It is basic to the relationship at both
levels
that Datcom should be paid for supply, as unless that happened it would
become commercially impossible for Datcom to continue to
participate.  It is
clear that payments have not been made in a regular course and that Datcom has
not been given by Oracal payments
which in the nature of business it would need
to have if Datcom was to carry on.  The practical basis for the venture to
continue
has not been put in place by the plaintiffs.  In my view this is very
adverse to a decision by a court to enforce other duties under
the relationship
which fall on the defendants.  It is important when the Court is asked to
enforce some contractual or analogous
obligation by an equitable remedy to
consider whether the whole skein of contractual obligations on both sides has
been complied
with or can be enforced.  In this regard the plaintiffs' counsel
proffered the usual undertaking as to damages, pointed out that
the plaintiffs
have claimed an inquiry before the Master to establish the amount due to the
defendants, and submitted that it was
open to me to grant relief on any
appropriate terms.  None of these measures could provide a ready or practical
solution to the difficulty
with which the defendants have been confronted
arising from there not having been a regular flow of payments, or appropriate
acknowledgment
of their entitlements or statements of the grounds of dispute.
The plaintiffs' failures in this regard are factors adverse to the
grant of an
interlocutory order, while the measures put forward by the plaintiffs' counsel
do not appear to me to be complete or
satisfactory remedies, or to assist the
defendants at the appropriate time.  
<P>

15  	The plaintiffs' counsel also made submissions based on
protection of confidential information.  There was no express agreement
or
arrangement establishing that information was or was to be treated as
confidential, or limiting the defendants' future use of
it.  There is nothing
in the nature of a secret process or any other characteristic which makes the
information inherently appropriate
for protection.  It is not in any sense a
secret or a confidence that Tandy, which has an extensive retail chain of
stores selling
electronic goods, is in the market to purchase them.  What
Oracal knew and could impart in March 1999 was somewhat more specific,
and it
related to an inquiry by Tandy's senior buyer for a particular class of goods,
but not so specific as to create any realistic
prospect of its being held that
it was inherently confidential in character.
<P>

16  	The plaintiffs' counsel also offered the usual undertaking as to
damages.  No evidence was put forward establishing that the
plaintiff companies
are financially responsible and in a position to fulfil such an undertaking.
OICP manifestly is not, while Oracal
has had remarkable difficulties even in
making some of the payments which have already been made, resorting to
expedients which are
not ordinarily followed in commerce, such as paying an
account with a customer's cheque endorsed on to the payee, arranging for an
account to be paid by being charged to the Mastercard of an individual whose
connection with Oracal does not appear (and payment
in that way was only
obtained after the relevant bank had declined approval on several occasions)
and another strange event in which
a cheque for $30,000 drawn by one of the
principals of Oracal on his private account, and not on the company's account,
was handed
over on account but was later cancelled.  These events and also the
difficulties relating to obtaining reconciliation of accounts
and payment to
which I have earlier referred, leave me to doubt the plaintiffs' financial
responsibility and the suitability of the
court's acting on its undertaking as
to damages.
<P>

17  	A very significant circumstance affecting the balance of
convenience is that dealings with Tandy should not be disturbed. 
Tandy is, in
relation to these parties, a powerful operator in the market and has a full
range of choices about the sources from
which it will obtain goods.
Involvement in Tandy in disruptions or disputes must be avoided.  
<P>

18  	The prima facie picture presented by the evidence is a fairly
simple one in which there was a flow of commerce in which the
parties
participated, the flow altered because Datcom could not get payment at
appropriate times for the goods which it was contributing,
and then the flow
altered as Datcom began to deal directly with Tandy and could get payment for
its goods.  The likely result of
any interlocutory injunction would be no more
than to prevent any transactions taking place at all; the injunction would not
compel
the plaintiffs to meet their obligations, there is significant doubt
about their capacity or willingness to do so, and intervention
by the court
would probably do no more than destroy the opportunity for any party to deal
with Tandy.
<P>

19  	Overall I felt great reluctance to compel the defendants to
comply with what the plaintiffs alleges is the defendants' side
of the
arrangements when the defendants have not received the benefits of compliance
by the defendants with the most elementary and
basal obligation of the whole
relationship.
<P>

20  	For these reasons I refused to make an interlocutory
injunction.
<P>

21  	The defendants' counsel was prepared, if the Court thought
right, to undertake, on terms which require to be settled, to keep
accounts of
its transactions, but I did not regard it as appropriate to require this
undertaking to be given.
