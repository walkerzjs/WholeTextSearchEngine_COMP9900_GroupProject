<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	Idoport Pty Limited, ("JMG"), and Market Holdings Pty
Limited, ("Market Holdings"), for which Mr J.J.J. Garnsey of Queen's
Counsel
and Mr M.C.L. Dicker of Counsel appeared, instituted these proceedings against
National Australia Bank Limited, ("NAB"),
National Markets Group Limited,
("NMG"), National Australia Financial Management Limited, ("NAFM"), Australian
Market Automated Quotation
(AUSMAQ) System Limited, ("AUSMAQ Systems"), and
Messrs G.L.L. Barnes, F.J. Cicutto, D.M. Krasnostein, K.F. Courtney and R.A.
McKimm,
for which and whom Mr H.K. Insall of Counsel appeared.  
<P>

2   	On 3 February 1999 the plaintiffs filed a Further Amended
Statement of Claim.  I am presently concerned with two Notices of
Motion filed
on the plaintiffs' behalf relating to the extent to which, if at all, access to
several witness statements, including
those of experts, relevant to the
computation of the very substantial damages claimed by the plaintiffs in the
order of some billions
of dollars, should be given to some of the defendants;
and the extent of discovery.  In this judgment I shall consider the
confidentiality
issue, and, to understand what it raises, it is necessary to
consider, albeit somewhat generally, the nature of the allegations made
in the
Further Amended Statement of Claim and certain agreements into which the
parties entered.
<P>

<b>The Further Amended Statement of Claim</b>
<P>

3   	I shall set out, firstly, some matters in the Further
Amended Statement of Claim, which, relevantly for present purposes, are
not
materially in issue.
<P>

4   	JMG and Market Holdings are, and were at all material
times, controlled by Mr John Malcolm Maconochie.  NMG and NAFM are, and
were at
all material times, subsidiaries of NAB, and AUSMAQ Systems has, since on or
before 13 September 1996, been a wholly owned
subsidiary of NMG.
<P>

5   	Mr Barnes is the Executive General Manager, Business and
Personal Financial Services, of NAB and has, since 11 December 1997,
been a
Director of NAFM.  He was, until on or about 29 April 1998, a Director of and
the Chairman of Directors of NMG and its wholly
owned subsidiaries AUSMAQ
Systems and AUSMAQ New Zealand Limited, ("AUSMAQ New Zealand"). Mr Cicutto is
the Chief Operating Officer
of NAB and, since on or about 9 March 1998, he has
been a Director of NAFM.  Since on or about 29 April 1998 he has been a
Director
and Chairman of Directors of NMG, AUSMAQ Systems and AUSMAQ New
Zealand.  Mr Krasnostein is the General Counsel of NAB, and since
on or about
19 November 1996, 13 February 1997 and 23 January 1997 respectively, he has
been a Director of AUSMAQ Systems, NMG and
AUSMAQ New Zealand.
<P>

6   	Mr Courtney and Mr McKimm have been Directors of AUSMAQ
Systems since on or about 6 November 1996, and Directors of NMG since
on or
about 13 January 1997.
<P>

7   	Prior to 1996 Mr Maconochie and Market Holdings developed
and created an on-line, securities transaction, information and portfolio
administrating and reporting service known as the "AUSMAQ Service", and owned
and controlled the various intellectual property rights
for that service,
including the Systems IP Rights as defined in a Consulting Agreement into which
JMG entered with NMG, AUSMAQ Systems
and NAB on 13 September 1996.  The
intellectual property rights, which are referred to in the pleading as the
"AUSMAQ IP", were licensed
by Market Holdings in accordance with a Licensing
Agreement to AUSMAQ Limited.  This was sub-licensed to AUSMAQ Limited's wholly
owned subsidiary AUSMAQ Systems, which provided the AUSMAQ Service.
<P>

8   	In paragraph 9 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim it
is alleged, under the heading "Misrepresentations by NAB", that
in or about
July, August and September 1996, Mr Maconochie, Market Holdings and Mr Peter
Walker of Messrs Ferrier Hodgson, who had
been appointed Voluntary
Administrator of AUSMAQ Limited on 30 June 1996, participated in negotiations
with NAB for the restructure
of the Group of Companies "of which AUSMAQ Systems
was a part and which were controlled by Mr Maconochie and Market Holdings".  It
is alleged that in the course of those negotiations NAB represented to Mr
Maconochie and Market Holdings, in relation to their entering
into certain
commercial transactions with it and NMG, that if those transactions were
entered into NMG and its subsidiaries, including
AUSMAQ Systems, would be
organised and operated independently of NAB and not as a division of it; that
NMG would be controlled by
a management committee on which JMG would have two
representatives with a right to attend and be heard, which management committee
would determine and manage the affairs of the NMG Group; that the management
committee of NMG would determine and be responsible
for the development,
operation and commercialisation of the AUSMAQ System throughout the world and
for monitoring the performance
of the business of NMG; that JMG would
participate integrally in a planning process to devise the strategic correction
and business
plans of the NMG Group; that Mr Maconochie was critical to the
success of the AUSMAQ Service and would be "effectively" the Chief
Executive
for a period of five years from November 1996 with various other requirements
to enable NMG to undertake the commercialisation
of the AUSMAQ business and the
global exploitation of AUSMAQ IP and its potential; that the Performance Bonus
to which JMG would
be entitled under the Consulting Agreement was and would be
equal in worth to a one third share in the equity of the NMG Group and
would be
struck on that basis; and that after seven years from the completion of the
restructure, NAB could acquire JMG's right to
receive the Performance Bonus by
payment to JMG of an amount nominated by NAB, which JMG could either accept, or
reject and nominate
its own price, and which NAB at its election could either
accept, reject, or sell its share to JMG at twice JMG's price.
<P>

9   	By their Points of Defence, filed on 25 February 1999, the
defendants deny that they made representations in the terms set
out in
paragraph 9 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim.  Mr Maconochie will,
accordingly, be a principal witness on the factual
issue as to whether the
representations were made.
<P>

10   	The Further Amended Statement of Claim alleges that these
representations were made by NAB in trade or commerce and, to the
extent that
each or any of them was as to a future matter, NAB had no reasonable grounds
for making them.  The plaintiffs also rely
on s.51A of the <b>Trade Practices
Act</b> and, inter alia, allege that the organisation, structure, and corporate
culture of NAB did not, at the time the representation was
made, and do not
permit a subsidiary to be organised and operated independently of and not as a
division of NAB.  Suffice to say,
for present purposes, that the essential
allegations made by the plaintiffs in relation to the alleged
misrepresentations and generally
are denied.
<P>

11   	In paragraph 10.6.2 of the Further Amended Statement of
Claim it is pleaded that the Consulting Agreement has not been and
is not being
implemented, observed, administered or enforced by NAB and NMG, such that the
Performance Bonus, to which JMG is entitled
under it, is and will be equal in
worth to a one third share in the equity of the NMG Group and will be struck on
that basis, which
allegation is denied.
<P>

12   	It is pleaded, and once again denied, that, in consequence
of the representations alleged, various agreements, including the
Consulting
Agreement, were entered into in consequence of which, inter alia, NMG acquired
the AUSMAQ IP, and Mr Maconochie and Market
Holdings procured JMG to comply
with, to continue to comply with and to seek to continue to comply with its
obligations under the
Consulting Agreement.  In these circumstances the whole
of the issued capital of AUSMAQ Systems was transferred to NMG; the plaintiffs
ceased negotiations with other interested parties and all activities aimed at
locating other interested parties to develop and exploit
commercially, with the
aim of mutual profit, the AUSMAQ IP; and incurred substantial costs and
expenditure to ensure the continued
operation and viability of NMG's business
and the provision of the AUSMAQ Service and compliance by the plaintiffs with
the various
agreements into which they entered.
<P>

13   	The Further Amended Statement of Claim then propounds the
plaintiffs' case in a number of ways, including obligations of NAB
under a
Guarantee of the Performance Bonus; implied terms in the Consulting Agreement;
the existence of a fiduciary relationship
between NAB and NMG, on the one hand,
and JMG, on the other; breaches of contract and fiduciary duty by NAB and NMG;
and participation
and threatened participation by the various personal
defendants in that conduct.  It is pleaded that NAB and NMG acted in
contravention
of the <b>Trade Practices</b> and the <b>Fair Trading Acts</b>
and the plaintiffs claim substantial damages.  Put shortly, but I think
sufficiently for present purposes, the defendants have denied
all substantial
allegations made against them.
<P>

<b>The Consulting Agreement</b>
<P>

14   	The Consulting Agreement, (Exhibit 1 on the application),
was entered into on 13 September 1996 between JMG, Valenti Pty Limited,
("the
Company"), AUSMAQ and NAB.  It defines "AUSMAQ Service" as:-
<P>

<b>".. the service of providing an automated securities trading system and
related services known as the Australian Market Automated
Quotation System or
AUSMAQ System or EUROMAQ regardless of its name and includes but is not limited
to, the holding of Securities
and Entitlements for clients, the provision of a
related deposit facility, execution of Securities transactions with related
client
portfolio administration and reporting and any service with equivalent
or similar functionality, and any enhancements, modifications
and additions to
the service anywhere in the world."</b>
<P>

15   	"Business plan" is defined as:-
<P>

<b>".. the latest business plan in respect of the operation, development and
commercialisation of the AUSMAQ Service by the Group in
respect of a financial
year which has been delivered by the Company under this Agreement."</b>
<P>

16   	"Confidential information" is defined as:-
<P>

<b>".. all information, knowledge, know-how, experience, expertise and designs
which have been or in the future are disclosed (whether
orally or in writing)
by or on behalf of the Group or an Operating Entity in connection with this
Agreement or which is otherwise
obtained by JMG in connection with this
Agreement or which is generated by JMG or any Consultant for the purposes of
performing their
obligations under this Agreement."</b>
<P>

17   	"Group" is defined as:-
<P>

<b>"The Company, System and any of their related bodies corporate from time to
time who accede to this Agreement."</b>
<P>

18   	Clause 3.1 imposes obligations on JMG to perform the
services "ascribed to it in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
(including any Business Plan)".   The Services are stated as being ones which
"may include, if so requested by any Authorised Officer"
a range of services
which, generally speaking, relate to the AUSMAQ Service and its promotion and
utilisation.  Clause 3.2 contemplates
that other specific services could be
required, and clause 4.1 provides for the preparation of business plans
"regarding the operation,
development and commercialisation of the AUSMAQ
Service throughout the world".
<P>

19   	The Agreement contains a number of provisions to
facilitate its operation and, in clause 7, provides for Performance Bonuses.
These are additional consideration for the Services of JMG, and a detailed
provision is made for their calculation.
<P>

20   	Clause 11 deals in detail with the rights to software and
data, and clause 12 contains a non-competition agreement.  Clause
13 provides
for the ownership of intellectual and industrial property, and clause 15 is
concerned with the Purchase of Rights.  It
provides that after the seventh
anniversary of certain specified events NAB may, any number of times but not
more than once in any
consecutive three months, initiate a process to purchase
the rights by delivering to JMG a notice offering to do so and specifying
the
proposed purchase price.  Within thirty days of receipt of such a notice, JMG
is required to deliver a notice to NAB in which
it either elects to accept or
reject NAB's offer and, if it rejects it, to specify a price at which JMG
offers the rights to NAB.
 Within twenty one days thereafter NAB is required to
deliver a notice to JMG in which it elects either to accept or reject JMG's
offer, and if it rejects it to offer the shares in the Relevant Operating
Entity to JMG for an amount equal to twice JMG's price,
or to terminate the
process without any transfer.  Provision is made for resolving the situation in
the event of a dispute.
<P>

21   	Clause 16 deals with confidentiality and provides, inter
alia, that JMG will hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence
and
not disclose any of it to any person save in certain stated circumstances.
<P>

22   	Mr Garnsey has stated that JMG considers itself as still
bound by the Consulting Agreement to perform the services for which
it
provides, and continues to do so.  Thus the confidential information is to be
shared with, among others, NAB.
<P>

<b>The Guarantee</b>
<P>

23   	On 6 November 1996 NAB and JMG entered into an agreement
entitled "Guarantee", which was Exhibit E on the application.  Under
the
definition of "Guaranteed Money" it is stated that it means all money which the
Company, whether alone or with another person,
becomes liable to pay to or for
the account of JMG for any reason whatever under or in connection with clause 7
of the Consulting
Agreement, being the payment of Performance Bonuses.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiffs' Case</b>
<P>

24   	It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that the
plaintiffs' case is that it was induced by representations made by
the
defendants to enter into the Agreements to which I have referred, that the
defendants have acted in breach of those Agreements
and of their other
obligations to the plaintiffs in the various ways pleaded and that, in
consequence, the plaintiffs have suffered
substantial damages.  The plaintiffs
seek to recover those damages and claim certain other relief.
<P>

25   	Consistently with the practice in this List the plaintiffs
have been required to furnish witness statements setting forth,
inter alia, the
way in which the claimed damages are computed.  In due course the defendants
will be obliged to file witness statements
which will include statements
relating to that issue.  It is inconceivable that there will not be substantial
disputes as to the
methodologies adopted, the assumptions made and the quantum
of damages.  One significant reason for the provision of witness statements
is
to forewarn the other party of the matters in issue, so that they can be dealt
with thoroughly at an evidentiary level at trial.
 Thus the true issues between
the parties are exposed.  Implicit in the procedure is the ability of the
parties and their legal advisers
to consider the witness statements properly
and to reply to them fully.  Prima facie, this can only be done if the party
has access
to the statements and is able to give proper instructions.  Further,
of course, the party, as a matter of procedural fairness, is
entitled to know
the case being made against him and to be in as good a position as possible to
answer it.  There are also assumptions,
save in exceptional cases and
circumstances, that the case will be heard in open Court and in the presence of
the parties.  Ultimately
a judgment will be published, which, once again save
for exceptional cases, will be available for all to read and it should set
forth
the reasoning process, which led to the conclusions.  Finally, parties
should be aware of the material to be deployed against them
in advance of the
hearing so that a compromise offer and settlement may be considered.  All of
this, if I may say so with respect,
is well understood and deviations from the
practice are only permissible in exceptional cases.
<P>

26   	The method of computation of the damages, at least in
part, is set forth in the Fourth and Fifth Statements of Mr Maconochie,
which
are Exhibits B1 and B2 on the application, the statement of Mr Ian David
Joslin, which is Exhibit B3 on the application, and
the statements of Mr
Michael Christopher McLaren Hume, which are Exhibits B4 and B5 on the
application.  These are the only statements
for which confidentiality is
claimed.  Mr Garnsey has submitted that these are all "expert" statements and,
therefore, that they
fall into a different category from statements dealing
simply with facts.  I do not agree that this is so and, in any event, in other
statements Mr Maconochie is a witness as to matters of fact.  His evidence in
relation to those matters may well have to be considered
in the light of his
evidence in Exhibits B1 and B2 and vice versa.
<P>

27   	Mr Garnsey stated that the application for confidentiality
was in relation to employees, officers or agents of NAB, ("officers"),
and the
personal defendants, who are officers of NAB.  He submitted that the plaintiffs
were seeking to confine the reports to the
legal representatives and expert
witnesses of NAB and the officers and to an in-house legal officer of NAB, (but
not Mr Krasnostein),
to which legal representatives, expert witnesses and
in-house legal officer access was to be given for the purpose of answering the
allegations, but without taking instructions, save to the extent to which I
shall refer, from NAB or the personal defendants or NAB's
officers.  
<P>

28   	In his oral submissions on 25 June 1999, at Tpp.17-19, Mr
Garnsey stated the extent to which confidentiality was sought thus:-
<P>

<b>"What we seek to prevent is what we see as the misuse of those statements by
employees and officers of the National Australia Bank
in relation to the
business which the Bank says is the business of the Bank and there is dispute
as to whether  that should be the
business of NMG.  When I said we don't object
to NMG officers and executives having access or personnel having access, we say
that
with respect to persons who are also not employees or officers of the
National Australia Bank."</b>
<P>

In his written submissions of 2 July 1999 he put:-
<P>

<b>"1.	The Plaintiffs submit that the contents of the documents the subject of
the confidentiality motion, including the fourth and fifth
statements of Mr
Maconochie, contain confidential information.  The confidential information
consists, in summary, of an assessment
of various components of markets in a
number of countries around the world.  Mr Maconochie has given evidence that he
is not aware
of such a study having been completed previously.  It is submitted
that the Court should infer that the study is detailed, comprehensive
and a
valuable one to potential competitors including NAB.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	The fourth and fifth statements of Mr Maconochie provide expert
opinions in relation to various markets.  The statements provide
expert
evidence, not factual evidence relating to factual issues in dispute in the
proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>  3.	The Plaintiffs do not object to access being given to:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	NMG;</b>
<P>

<b>	(b)	a legal officer at NAB;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	counsel briefed in the proceedings for the Defendants;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	solicitors briefed in the proceedings for the Defendants,</b>
<P>

<b>	subject to undertakings being given.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.	In the first instance it is likely that the legal advisers of the
Defendant will form a view that the fourth and fifth statements
of Mr
Maconochie need to be considered by expert witnesses on behalf of the
Defendants.  That such decision is an appropriate one
and the decision is an
appropriate one and the likely one should be inferred from the contents of the
statements.</b>
<P>

<b>  5.	If that view is expressed to the solicitor for NAB and through him to
responsible officers at the NAB it should be inferred that
that advice would be
followed.  At that stage it would not be necessary for persons other than a
relevant legal officer at the NAB
to have reviewed the statements.</b>
<P>

<b>  6.	The experts will then give their opinions on the matters contained in
the documents sought to be made confidential.  If in giving
those opinions they
form the view that factual instructions are needed in relation to certain
matters then they will indicate the
areas for factual instruction and the
solicitor at NAB can make enquiries within the Bank as to the areas of
expertise without disclosing
the detail of the matters.</b>
<P>

<b>  7.	If it is necessary to disclose part of the documents sought to be made
confidential to persons other than the NAB solicitor within
the NAB then the
solicitors on behalf of the Defendants can contact the solicitors for the
Plaintiff.  In such contact they can identify
in general terms the areas where
disclosure is sought to be made to persons other than the NAB in house
solicitor and the identity
of the persons to whom the disclosure is
sought.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	If such disclosure is limited to identified persons for identified
reasons it is likely that the Plaintiffs would consent to
it.  The Defendants
are protected by the ability to come back to Court to vary any confidentiality
orders made for the purposes of
disclosing further material to those in house
NAB executives.</b>
<P>

<b>  9.	In our submission the above system is appropriate and workable.</b>
<P>

<b>  10.	It is to be noted that the Defendants did not take up the suggestion
from the Court last Friday to provide a list of persons
to whom access to the
information is sought."</b>
<P>

<b>...............</b>
<P>

<b>"1.	The statements in respect of which a special regime for confidentiality
is sought are expert statements and it is necessary normally
that they be
considered and met by other expert statements.  The regime envisages complete
access, subject to undertakings, of the
defendants experts.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	The defendants have not put on any evidence that access beyond that
provided to independent legal representatives and expert
witnesses in the
regime is necessary for the purposes of obtaining or giving
instructions.</b>
<P>

<b>  3.	The NMG Group is the party most directly concerned with the contents of
the statements in respect of which the regime is sought
and NMG's chief
operating officer and other employees under the regime sought have, subject to
the provision of undertakings, complete
access to the statements.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.	The statements in respect of which the regime is sought have the same
quality as confidential commercial documents: they identify
and examine
addressable markets and ascertain the degree of penetration of which the AUSMAQ
Service or any similar or equivalent
service should have been capable by
reference to an analysis of other market participants and market shares and by
application of
market theory and probable outcomes.  The contents are therefore
a prospective business plan for which the AUSMAQ Service or <i>any similar or
equivalent service</i>, as NAB's Maple Leaf and Independence One, viewed at the
present time, which is preparatory to any more detailed business plan. 
The
contents could also be used for the business activity of dealer groups and
financial product suppliers, which are core business
of NAB.  This information
would not be provided to such persons as customers.  See Maconochie XXN
25/06/99 p15 line 35 to p16 line
45."</b>
<P>

29   	Mr Garnsey submitted that the subject matter of the
protection was that the statements contain novel market studies; i.e.
studies
which have not been done before in relation to the NMG and the AUSMAQ Service,
and that when one looks at the contents, whilst
some of it is publicly
available, and some of it may or may not be in relation to concerns about the
market share of AUSMAQ, the
studies will be of direct benefit to NAB in respect
of certain competing products it allegedly has, known as "Maple Leaf" and
"Independence
One".  Hence, it was submitted that NAB and its officers should
not have access, other than through the indirect route I have noted.
<P>

30   	The issue, accordingly, concerns the entitlement of the
defendant NAB and its officers, who, of course, include the personal
defendants, to have access to the statements, save to the very limited manner
to which I have referred.
<P>

31   	Mr Insall submitted that there was nothing novel in the
statements such as to justify such a restrictive order; that, in any
event, NAB
was entitled to the information pursuant to the Consulting Agreement; and, more
importantly for present purposes, that
not only were the defendants bound by
the implied undertaking as to the use to which the material could be put, but
that they were
entitled, as a matter of procedural fairness, to read the
evidence sought to be used against them and they would be hampered in their
preparation of the defence to the case if they were denied access to that
evidence.  Mr Garnsey's response was that as these were
expert statements the
rights of the defendants denied access to them would be protected by a
consideration of the statements by their
own experts and legal advisers and the
taking of such instructions as may be necessary, but under the supervision of
the plaintiffs
and/or the Court.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Maconochie</b>
<P>

32   	The evidence in support of the Notice of Motion for
confidentiality was contained in two affidavits sworn by Mr Maconochie
on 2
June 1999. Reliance was only placed upon paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 65 to 68 of his
longer affidavit.  In paragraph 66 Mr Maconochie
said he was concerned at the
establishment and development of the Maple Leaf and Independence One Services,
other than by NMG, and,
after reading a press release of NAB, he wrote, on 4
May 1999, to a general manager of NAB and forwarded a copy of that letter to
Mr
Meikle setting forth those concerns.  
<P>

33   	In his shorter affidavit of 2 June 1999 Mr Maconochie
referred to the reports in respect of which confidentiality is sought,
and I
admitted, subject to relevance, his evidence that he had spent "hundreds of
hours preparing my fourth and fifth damages statements".
 In paragraph 7 he
said that having regard to the allegations made by the plaintiffs against the
defendants he, as a director of
the plaintiffs, had a considerable fear and
concern that the material in those statements "if filed and served on the
defendants
without orders being made by the Court in terms of the Notice of
Motion filed on 1 June 1999 ... relating to confidentiality undertakings"
would
probably be misused "by the defendants, or some of them, or otherwise used
solely for the commercial interests of the defendants,
or some of them".  I
find this last statement difficult to accept as, clearly enough, one purpose of
using the statements would be
to marshall evidence on the damages issue.
<P>

34   	In the first sentence of paragraph 8, which I admitted
subject to relevance, he said:-
<P>

<b>"As far as I am aware, the analysis performed in the various reports
referred to in paragraph 5 above is the first analysis of its
type performed in
the world relating to the development, marketing, commercial exploitation and
work of the AUSMAQ System or any
system having similar or equivalent, to any
degree, functionality to the AUSMAQ System."</b>
<P>

I rejected the next sentences and admitted the following sentence subject to
relevance:-
<P>

<b>"They would also benefit and be of use to third parties who are or might be
competitors of the AUSMAQ Service."</b>
<P>

I admitted the final sentence to establish that Mr Maconochie has the fear to
which he referred in it, but not as evidence of the
truth of the facts alleged
therein: Tp.2.  That sentence reads:-
<P>

<b>"I fear if access to the various reports is not carefully restricted within
NAB Group as sought in the Notice of Motion, especially
in view of the size of
the NAB Group and the number of its relevant employees, to whom the various
reports could otherwise be shown,
the confidentiality and value of the reports
to JMG may be lost irretrievably."</b>
<P>

35   	Mr Maconochie was cross-examined.  
<P>

36   	He said, Tp.5, that so far as he was aware JMG is
complying with the terms of the Consulting Agreement "fully", and that that
is
JMG's only activity by which it is obliged to devote full time service to the
performance of the Consulting Agreement.  It would
appear that this compliance
could lead to certain of the material in the witness statements being made
available to NAB and its officers
in any event.
<P>

37   	At Tp.6 he said he had examined the material in the five
statements in respect of which the claim for confidentiality was
made, and
asserted that it is confidential to JMG.
<P>

38   	He was taken to various portions of the statements, but it
became clear that the claim for confidentiality, whether the information
was
inherently confidential or not, was based upon all the information in each
statement being "confidential" irrespective of whether
some of it was in the
public domain, because it was the way in which the material was set out or
drawn together to enable conclusions
to be reached.  It must, however, be borne
in mind that these exercises were undertaken for the purpose of preparing
witness statements
specifying the claim for damages.  There is no suggestion
that any of them were prepared as working documents of the plaintiffs in
the
ordinary course of their business.  Further, it is arguable that they contained
information to which the defendants are  entitled
in any event pursuant to the
Consulting Agreement with which the plaintiffs claimed to be conforming.  His
position was made clear
by the following evidence, Tpp.10-11:-
<P>

<b>"A. If you are asking me whether other people may not have the information
on that page, I cannot say.  All I am saying is that that
page was provided to
JMG as part of a confidential statement.  Now, as to whether - it may well have
been provided, the information,
whether or not in that form, may well have been
provided to other people for other purposes, but that page was provided to JMG
as
part of a confidential report for the particular purposes of this
statement."</b>
<P>

39   	Subsequently, at Tp.11, he said:-
<P>

<b>"A. Mr Insall, I am sure that if I went through, as on the page of page 2
that you have just asked me, that much of that information
may well have been
provided by Mr Joslin to other people, and as such is not confidential per se,
and that other information in his
report, which relies on published figures, is
not confidential per se because it is available publicly.  What I do say is
that the
assembly of all that information in one report, in the format and the
context in which it is presented, is confidential information.
 Now, that is
not to say that the sources of the information or the information per se in
which the report is based isn't, itself,
confidential, and that applies equally
to the page 2 that you have been asking me about.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Can you identify in the report any information whatsoever which is
confidential to JMG?</b>
<P>

<b>A.  Sir, the entire report in the context, in the form in which it is
presented, is confidential to JMG.  It is not available to any
other person,
except to JMG, and therefore it is all confidential to JMG.  As I have just
said, to the extent that sources, public
sources of information which are
identified in the report, throughout the report, are public information, that
information is public."</b>
<P>

40   	At Tp.12 he said:-
<P>

<b>"What I am saying, Mr Insall, is what is confidential about this report is
that it has been formulated and presented and it is drawn
from sources, either
public or non-public sources, and assembled in the one spot and, therefore, the
entire report is confidential,
even though some aspects of it may be based on
public information."</b>
<P>

41   	Mr Insall cross-examined Mr Maconochie about the
obligation of JMG to prepare business plans, which would deal with certain
of
the matters referred to in the statements and, in particular, the growth of the
AUSMAQ System overseas.  This led to an argument
as to breaches by the
defendants of their obligation to fund the business plan, but not to one about
the furnishing of that information
pursuant to the Consulting Agreement.
<P>

42   	Further cross-examination of Mr Maconochie disclosed that
much of the material in the statements was derived from other sources
in which
there did not appear to be any particular confidentiality, the point of Mr
Maconochie's objection being encapsulated in
his concluding answer in
cross-examination, Tp.24:-
<P>

<b>"But the fact that we have used certain techniques, together with the
research and the other methodology that has been employed in
reports,
particularly reports filed, is confidential.  One might not know, for example,
whether those were relevant or were not relevant
or applicable or how or might
be used.  I regard that as very confidential."</b>
<P>

Once again, at the risk of being repetitive, I note that the statements were
prepared for a very specific purpose.  They are not
confidential business
records of the plaintiffs, which have been discovered or produced pursuant to a
subpoena or notice to produce.
 They are the proofs of evidence prepared for
the express purpose of supporting the plaintiffs'  claim for damages, and to
which
the defendants are obliged to reply if they wish to contest that claim,
which, I am prepared to infer from the pleadings, they do.
 Further, the legal
advisers are, prima facie, entitled to the benefit of full instructions to
enable full answer to be made to the
witness statements and the makers of them
to be cross-examined as effectively as possible.
<P>

43   	At Tpp.25-26 Mr Maconochie said:-
<P>

<b>"I have seen reports which deal with all the elements which I consider are
necessary to do the analysis and I have used as many of
those as I could find
and use in the time available, so that the various reports, such as the Cerulli
reports or the book that counsel
referred to, which is publicly available, is a
matter of knowing in this particular service and as far as I know there is not,
and
the report sets out why, there are not these services in the world and the
reasons why certain people, certain corporations, would
find it attractive on
the one hand to develop them and not attractive on the other.  But I have not
seen a study where the available
market information and the trends that have
been measured in the marketplace by research houses have been put together in
the one
spot to evaluate a service such as the AUSMAQ Service and it is the -
the information in these reports could be used to either build
a competitive
service or to provoke someone or stir someone into developing such a service,
or they could be used by better net providers
or, as I have called them, a
broker/dealer or a product service supplier.  And those two activities, those
two activities are included
in the activities with which the Bank and its
executives are actively involved in every day.  I have not seen this
information in
the one spot before, I don't believe the Bank has that
information."</b>
<P>

44   	This evidence points up the difficulty the present
application confronts.  The plaintiffs wish to say that the damages are
calculated by adopting that methodology, but they wish to deny certain of the
defendants the opportunity of considering that claim
for damages, as expressed
in the statements, for themselves, and furnishing their legal advisers and
experts with instructions based
on mature consideration of them.
<P>

<b>The Problem</b>
<P>

45   	The witness statements under consideration are ones
whereby the plaintiffs seek to assert the basis on which they claim damages.
In the fulness of time they will be answered and, on the hearing, subjected to
objections and cross-examination.  The ability for
those representing the
defendants to exercise those rights depends on them and qualified experts
obtaining full and proper instructions.
 Efficiency in the administration of
the case demands that that occur with the minimum of delay and impediment.
Prima facie, litigants
are entitled to full access to evidentiary material
sought to be deployed against them.  In circumstances where that information
is
of a confidential, and hence commercially sensitive, nature the Court can give
directions confining the extent to which and to
whom it may be disseminated.
However, in doing so the Court must have regard not merely to the
confidentiality or commercial sensitivity
of the information, but also of the
basic right of the party against whom it is tendered to have every reasonable
opportunity to
answer it fully.  Prima facie, the restriction that only an
"in-house" legal officer of NAB, in addition to NAB's legal advisers
and expert
witnesses, may have access to the statements, on the basis for which Mr Garnsey
contends, places an undue restriction
upon the officers of NAB required to
answer them or to furnish instructions such that the statements may be answered
as effectively
as possible. This is made clear when the lengthy statements are
considered.  They purport to be inter-related, they contain references
to other
statements and reference works, and they set forth tables and graphs.  Any
attempt to obtain instructions in the manner
suggested by Mr Garnsey would not
only be a most arduous task, but it may well be quite misleading to the
defendants if they do not
have the opportunity of assessing the context in
which the matter about which they are asked to give instructions appears.  It
would
certainly impair the furnishing of full instructions.
<P>

46   	It seems to me it is necessary to consider, although
briefly, each statement.  The Fourth Statement of Mr Maconochie says,
in
paragraph 1.2:-
<P>

<b>"I make this statement to the best of my present recollection, information
and belief, but may seek to supplement it or correct it
should that be
necessary in light of fuller documents or information not presently available
to me and material to this statement."</b>
<P>

Whilst this may be an understandable reservation, it hardly points to any
inherent worth in the information which is said to be
confidential.  If Mr
Maconochie has no greater confidence in it, the claim for confidentiality
becomes highly suspect.
<P>

47   	Paragraph 1.3 states that the information in the
statement, and the documents referred to in it, are both confidential and
commercially sensitive information "of or concerning JMG, NMG, and/or NAB", and
that the plaintiffs wish to maintain confidentiality
and to seek Court orders
in aid thereof.  It is difficult to see why, if the information is of or
concerning inter alia NAB, NAB
and its officers are not entitled to it.  Rather
this would seem to provide an additional reason why it should be.
<P>

48   	In paragraph 4 Mr Maconochie sets forth the purpose of the
statement in the following terms:-
<P>

<b>"4.1	To set out or exhibit financial calculations and information concerning
the actual, projected and/or potential revenue and cash
flows of NMG, <u>and of
certain NAB services (for example, the Maple Leaf and Independence One
Services)</u> which JMG contends are similar or equivalent services to the
AUSMAQ Service for the purposes of the Consulting Agreement and the
associated
rights of JMG which can be relevant to its claims in these proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.2	To state what, in my opinion, is or should have been the nature and
relevant aspects of the actual, contingent or potential
assets of NMG and JMG
represented by the provisions of the Consulting Agreement concerning the buy
out of the Performance Bonus rights
of JMG; and the related rights of JMG under
that Agreement, as assumptions to be made for the purposes of valuation of
those assets
and the ascertainment of the value or worth of business
opportunities lost to NMG by reason of failure to exploit the AUSMAQ Service,
and whether a value can be attributed to those assets and lost
opportunities.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.3	To state what, in my opinion, is the basis for the value and for the
valuation of the actual, contingent or potential assets
of NMG and JMG in
relation to the Consulting Agreement and the buy out of the Performance Bonus
rights of JMG and the related rights
of JMG under that Agreement and to state
what, in my opinion, is the basis for the value or worth and for the valuation
of business
opportunities lost to NMG by reason of failure to exploit the
AUSMAQ Service, and the value which can or should be attributed to
those assets
and lost opportunities.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.4	To state what, in my opinion, is or should have been the nature and
relevant aspects of the actual, contingent or potential
assets of NMG and JMG
represented by the provisions of NAB's Guarantee in relation to the Performance
Bonuses payable under the Consulting
Agreement, as assumptions to be made for
the purposes of valuation of those assets, and the ascertainment of the value
or worth of
business opportunities of NMG by reason of failure to exploit the
AUSMAQ Service, and whether a value can be attributed to those
assets and lost
opportunities.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.5	To set out what, in my opinion, as a result of my experience and
knowledge of JMG and NMG and the NMG Group, and the AUSMAQ
Service, the System
IP Rights, and my understanding of the Consulting Agreement, the NAB Guarantee
of the Consulting Agreement and
the other related Agreements are the relevant
factors, and the appropriate and proper rationale and methodology for the
valuation
of JMG's and NMG's rights and actual, contingent or potential assets
under or in relation to the Consulting Agreement, the AUSMAQ
Service, the
System IP Rights, the NAB Guarantee of the Consulting Agreement and other
related Agreements and the ascertainment of
the value or worth of business
opportunities of NMG by reason of failure to exploit the AUSMAQ Service.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.6	To place a value on assets and lost opportunities to the extent I am
able and competent to do so, or to provide a basis for
other expert witnesses
so to do. </b>
<P>

<b>  4.7	To provide the information therein to certain other expert witnesses
for JMG in these proceedings for the purposes of their
providing their opinion
in relation to certain issues in these proceedings."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

49   	I have set out the purposes in extenso, because it seems
to me that once they are understood the importance of officers of
NAB and the
personal defendants having access to the statement is made clear.  Central to a
number of those purposes  is the position
and potential liability of NAB and
the personal defendants.  This is propounded in the context of Maple Leaf and
Independence One
Services as to which, according to the evidence, Mr Maconochie
obtained confidential information.  
<P>

50   	The statement proceeds for one hundred pages.  It contains
assumptions, calculations, opinions and conclusions.  In a number
of respects
it is argumentative.  It seeks to set forth the issues as Mr Maconochie
perceives them and to express his views, opinions
and conclusions about those
matters.  The amount of damages claimed is set forth in paragraph 6.3 and is a
very large sum.  Whilst
the amount in issue should not dictate the appropriate
principles to be applied, when it is some billions of dollars it is obvious
that the Court must ensure that the defendants are not, save for very good
reasons, precluded from knowing the allegations they are
required to answer and
being able to do so as fully as possible.  Anything less would be a serious
denial of procedural fairness.
 An adverse conclusion to the defendants in this
litigation would be financially ruinous to them.  It is unthinkable that such a
possibility could be brought about because the defendants could not consider
the evidentiary material sought to be used against them
properly.
<P>

51   	It may be that, if objection is taken, portions of Mr
Maconochie's Fourth Statement will be held to be inadmissible.  Many
of the
conclusions and opinions he expresses may be thought to be either matters in
respect of which he has no relevant expertise
or matters for the Court's
determination.  The argumentative nature of the statement may be thought to go
far beyond putting forward
matters necessitating expert opinion and to travel
into the area of the interpretation of documents relevant to the present
situation.
 Whilst, at this stage, I am not ruling on the admissibility of the
statement, it is not inappropriate that regard should be had
to those matters
when a claim for confidentiality is being made.  Further, the tactics at trial
may, depending on full instructions,
mean that no objection is taken to some
portions of such material to allow cross-examination on it.  Such a tactical
approach, particularly
in a case of this nature, could only be taken on
instructions from the clients, which instructions would demand an understanding
of the witness statements.
<P>

52   	An example of material, the prima facie admissibility of
which may well be in issue, appears in the last three sentences of
the fourth
paragraph of paragraph 9.10.2, and the first two sentences of the fifth
paragraph of that paragraph.  That is followed
by the following sentence:-
<P>

<b>"I therefore consider it reasonable to make the simplifying assumption for
the purposes of projecting a parallel growth rate in the
gross operating
revenues in NMG's projections ... that a similar rate of growth can be assigned
to both the retirement and individual
asset market places."</b>
<P>

53   	A substantial part of the statement refers to information
which is within the knowledge of the defendants.  Also there are
a number of
tables and graphs, which can only be considered, in my opinion, by the personal
defendants and officers of NAB looking
at them in the context of the material
concerning them.  It would, in my opinion, be quite impossible for the legal
representatives
and experts to obtain instructions in relation to this
statement by simply reading it and formulating questions, which seem
appropriate
from such a reading.  The most obvious way to take instructions is
to ask the party what he or she says about the matters raised.
 In that way the
clients, with their own knowledge of the matter, are able to put to their legal
advisers and experts points they
think are worthy of consideration, and which
otherwise may not have occurred to them.
<P>

54   	A further example, and much of what I have said is only
intended as exemplifying the difficulties, occurs in paragraph 12.7:-
<P>

<b>"In my opinion, based on the growth performance of the NAB over the past
five years (19% pa compound) and the NAB's objective to double
the share price
in five years (15% pa compound), a (sic) this is a reasonable basis on which to
project growth in the future in 2003
and beyond.  In my opinion therefore, a
growth rate of ... past .... in the gross operating revenues of Maple Leaf and
Independence
One is a reasonable assumption to make in projecting cash flows
for those services past .....  I refer to paragraphs 13.2 and 13.5
below."</b>
<P>

Those paragraphs refer to certain information said to support the assumptions.

<P>

55   	I shall leave aside for the moment the admissibility of
much of what is in the statement.  Having read it I am of the opinion,
for the
reasons to which I have referred, that it is not a statement which is
relevantly confidential, in the sense that access should
be restricted in the
way for which the plaintiffs contend.  Nor do I consider that the plaintiffs
have shown that the prima facie
position in relation to a witness statement,
particularly in the present context, should not apply.
<P>

56   	The Fifth Statement relies upon the purposes to which I
have referred and one further purpose.  It is a very lengthy statement
and
follows, to a large extent, the form of the Fourth Statement in setting forth
assumptions, conclusions and opinions.  It draws
heavily upon various texts
and, in particular, one by J. Hagel from which it quotes extensively.  In
paragraph 9.8 it is stated:-
<P>

<b>"I refer below to a number of quotes, charts and diagrams from this book
which, in my opinion, can be applied to or in relation to
the AUSMAQ Service
and the matters considered in this statement."</b>
<P>

It is only necessary to have regard to this to appreciate the difficulty which
would be experience by anyone seeking to take instructions
from the defendants
and officers of NAB, who would be required to have before them the work from
which Mr Maconochie worked, the
statements made by Mr Maconochie from that
work, his commentary on them, and the ultimate conclusions and opinions drawn
by Mr Maconochie.
 In my opinion, the remarks I made in relation to the Fourth
Statement are equally applicable to it.
<P>

57   	Mr Joslin's statement of 19 April 1999, Exhibit B3, is
aimed at assessing the damages caused to an entity by the delay in
beginning
operations in Europe.  Once again the amount assessed is very large and, under
the heading "Objective", Mr Joslin states
in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2:-
<P>

<b>"3.1	The initial objective of this report is to give an opinion on the
likely revenues the National Markets Group (NMG) would have
earned from its
operations in the European investment market had the original business plans
produced by JMG been implemented in
full.</b>
<P>

<b>  3.2	A further principal objective of this report is to give an opinion as
to the extent to which NMG's prospects have been damaged
by the delay that has
occurred in developing the business in Europe."</b>
<P>

58   	Mr Joslin states that his analysis consists of answering
the following five questions:-
<P>

<b>"To what extent was the target market ready for automation?</b>
<P>

<b>To what extent could the structure and nature of the target market
facilitate market entry by NMG?</b>
<P>

<b>How attractive would AUSMAQ/EUROMAQ have been to the marketplace?</b>
<P>

<b>What is the size and composition of the market likely to be by 1 January
2004?</b>
<P>

<b>What market share could NMG have achieved by 1 January 2004 and what is the
likely annual gross income it could have generated?"</b>
<P>

59   	Mr Joslin states that by answering those questions he
would calculate a range of the annual gross earnings (if any) that he
estimates
AUSMAQ/EUROMAQ could have earned from the UK market if the original business
plans had been implemented.
<P>

60   	Mr Joslin set out certain other matters he was considering
and the assumptions on which he proceeded.  He then commenced to
answer the
questions to which I have referred.
<P>

61   	I think it necessary to say immediately that Mr Joslin's
statement, which runs to some thirty four pages and has a number
of appendices,
is structured more as an expert's report than the statements of Mr Maconochie.
If I may say so with respect, it is
a very helpful document in determining the
extent to which confidentiality should be given to it and the other statements
because
it sets forth the various factors which, in my opinion, the plaintiffs
would probably have to establish in the course of seeking
to prove the amount
of damages to which they may be entitled.  However, in reading the statement it
becomes clear that Mr Joslin
is relying upon an application of statistics and
information available to him from which he has drawn various conclusions.  As
Mr
Maconochie conceded, and a reading of the statement bears out the
correctness of this concession, there is no inherent confidentiality,
or
confidentiality "per se", in this material.  Mr Joslin has used the material to
calculate damages by the methodology he has adopted
and, at the conclusion of
his report, he expresses an opinion, based on an assumption that had EUROMAQ
been launched earlier, what
it could reasonably be assumed would have been the
growth in its annual gross income.
<P>

62   	In my opinion there is nothing inherently confidential in
this material, and it seems to me that for NAB to be in a position
to respond
appropriate officers of it should have access to the report.  The same applies
to the personal defendants.  As I have
said, it is a quite lengthy report and
it is very detailed.  The proposition that instructions should be taken in the
way submitted
by Mr Garnsey is not, in my opinion, a fair method of taking
instructions in relation to the statement.  Nor do I consider that a
case based
on confidentiality has been made out.
<P>

63   	The first statement of Mr Hume, for which confidentiality
is claimed, is his second: Exhibit B4,  Mr Hume's expertise is in
the provision
of consultancy services.  He sets forth, in paragraph 3.2, a summary of twelve
conclusions he reached, concluding that
he could not precisely quantify the
loss to NMG, and consequently to JMG, occasioned by the former's failing to
pursue the operations.
 He expanded on this.
<P>

64   	In paragraph 4 he sets forth characteristics of the AUSMAQ
Service, and states that it has two extremely important attributes
that make it
unique, which he identifies.
<P>

65   	In paragraph 4.9 he sets forth the position of NMG after
entry into the Restructuring Agreement and the Consulting Agreement.
 
<P>

66   	In paragraph 5 he deals with a different matter and, in
paragraph 6, with the variety of markets to which the AUSMAQ Service
and the
AUSMAQ IP can be applied both in Australia and overseas.
<P>

67   	In paragraph 7 he considers another business and some
historical data and, in paragraph 8, he suggests the extent to which
the global
transaction markets of AUSMAQ System and AUSMAQ IP could compete.
<P>

68   	In paragraph 9 he deals with the loss of opportunity and,
as with Mr Maconochie's statements, he sets forth certain opinions
without,
perhaps, stating the bases on which they can be substantiated.
<P>

69   	In paragraph 10 he states that he has read Mr Joslin's
statement of 19 April 1999 and that he agrees with his conclusions
on the
damage to NMG's and JMG's commercial interests in certain markets.  This bald
assertion highlights the importance of being
able to take full instructions in
relation to Mr Joslin's statement.  In paragraphs 10.4 to 10.8 Mr Hume sets
forth various generalisations,
and he does not condescend to any
particularisation in monetary terms.  In his second statement of 9 June 1999,
Exhibit B5, he sets
forth his expertise and his own view of his qualifications.
In paragraph 3 he refers to some discussions he had with Mr Maconochie
and
certain advice he gave Mr Maconochie without specifying the nature of that
advice.  In paragraph 4 he states that he had seen
a copy of paragraph 11 of Mr
Maconochie's Fifth Statement and:-
<P>

<b>"Mr Maconochie's application of probabilities to determine the probable
(`expected' in statistical terms) loss to NMG, and consequently
to JMG, set out
in paragraph 11 of his proposed Statement Five is correct and in accordance
with standard actuarial and statistical
practice."</b>
<P>

This assertion of correctness, which it may be thought is a matter for the
Court, none-the-less requires Mr Hume's statement to
be read with Mr
Maconochie's.
<P>

70   	In my opinion there is nothing inherently confidential in
either of Mr Hume's reports, which confidentiality and, if it exists,
commercial sensitivity, cannot be accommodated by the giving of appropriate
undertakings and the implied undertaking.
<P>

<b>The Law</b>
<P>

71   	Both parties relied on the decisions of the English Court
of Appeal in <b>Warner-Lambert Co v Glaxo Laboratories Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20RPC%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] RPC
354</a> and the Queensland Supreme Court of <b>Magellan Petroleum Australia Limited
v Sagasco Amadeus Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20QdR%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 QdR 37</a>, in each of which the Courts
sought to balance the rights of the parties by having due regard to the
confidentiality or commercial
sensitivity of information upon which one party
wished to rely against the other, and the right of the other to properly
repulse
the case thereby sought to be made against it.
<P>

72   	The first decision concerned an alleged patent
infringement and, accordingly, the confidentiality of the manufacturing
processes
pursuant to which certain material was produced.  It was recognised
that the parties were competitors "in a highly competitive market".
 It is
necessary to stress that in the present case Mr Garnsey submits that the proper
inference to be drawn is that NAB is acting
as a competitor through Maple Leaf
and Independence One, notwithstanding his further submissions that the
plaintiffs are seeking
to comply with the Consulting Agreement.  The
consequence of the latter submission is, of course, that NAB and its officers
become
entitled to certain information conformably with the terms of that
Agreement.  This leads, to some extent, to the conclusion that
the effect of
competition and confidentiality associated with it, (assuming for the moment
that Mr Garnsey's submission as to competition
is correct), is of far less
significance than it may otherwise have been.  Further, so it seems to me, the
mere fact of competition
cannot, of itself, clothe documents sought to be used
against another party with confidentiality such that the other party cannot
answer them effectively.
<P>

73   	At p.358 Buckley LJ said:-
<P>

<b>"None of these cases purports to lay down a form of order suitable for
universal use.  Nor, I think, does any of them indicate that
the Court might
not in appropriate circumstances at a later stage in the action have directed
disclosure to a wider class of persons
or on different terms.  In my judgment,
the Court must in each case decide what measure of disclosure should be made,
and to whom,
and upon what terms, having regard to the particular circumstances
of the case, bearing in mind that, if a case for disclosure is
made out, the
applicant should have as full a degree of appropriate disclosure as will be
consistent with adequate protection of
any trade secret of the
respondent."</b>
<P>

74   	At pp.359-360 his Lordship continued:-
<P>

<b>"The Judge was, as it appears to me, concerned to ensure that the plaintiff
company, in the person of some responsible officer, should
have an opportunity
not only of being advised by technical experts and legal advisers, but of
knowing the facts on which that advice
was founded, so as to be able to form a
personal judgment on how to deal with the action.  There are obviously strong
arguments in
favour of a party to litigation being enabled so far as possible
to chart his own course in the light of professional advice.  It
is right,
however, I think, to say that in the present case there is a particular
circumstance which complicates the problem.  The
processes patented by the
plaintiff and the process employed by the defendant are such<u> that it is
impossible to discern, by analysis or otherwise, from the product of either how
it has been made</u> - that is, which of a number of possible chemical
processes has been employed.  This would make it, as I conceive, virtually
impossible
to police any terms imposed in the use of such information as is
disclosed; and this would be even more so, having regard to the
fact that the
plaintiff operates outside this country and that the individuals to whom the
plaintiff wants disclosure to be made
are all resident outside the
jurisdiction.  This should, in my opinion, make the Court particularly careful
not to expose the defendants
to any unnecessary risk of their trade secrets
leaking to any competitors.</b>
<P>

<b>If in a particular case it is right that disclosure of any facts should be
made by one party to his opponent's advisers before trial,
it must normally
follow as a matter of course that the opponent should be entitled to know the
facts so disclosed.  His advisers
are his agents in the matter and strong
grounds must be required for excluding the principal from knowledge which his
agents properly
require on his behalf."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

Whilst the present situation is far removed from a patent case, there is an
analogy with the capacity to analyse, for in this case
the plaintiffs' claim,
in essence, is that it has performed that task in relation to readily available
non confidential information.
 Not only are the defendants entitled, on any
view, to see how that has been done, but they could also, at least arguably,
carry
out the same task.  Further, as his Lordship said, "strong grounds" must
exist to preclude the principal from his agent's knowledge.
<P>

75   	His Lordship observed that the principle must be subject
to some modification in relation to the protection of trade secrets,
and
continued:-
<P>

<b>"Its" (the plaintiff's) "legal and expert advisers are for the relevant
purpose its agents to acquire knowledge but they are not authorised
to make any
major decisions on the company's behalf such as, for instance, a decision
whether to continue or abandon the action.
 Such a decision should be made by
the company, not by its legal advisers, and still less by its scientific
advisers.  It must be
made by a duly authorised officer or agent or body of
agents such as a managing director or the board of directors of the
company."</b>
<P>

In the instant case there has not been demonstrated by the plaintiff, to my
satisfaction, any reason why the modification for which
Mr Garnsey contends
should be applied.
<P>

76   	In <b>Magellan Petroleum</b> White J was concerned with
the question of discovery of certain documents, which had come into existence
in the course of an attempted
takeover offer.  At p.38 her Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"The essence of Sagasco's submission is that it is entitled to an order
restricting disclosure of these documents to counsel and litigation
solicitors
because, notwithstanding the implied undertaking not to use for any collateral
purpose the documents obtained on discovery,
knowledge once gained will
necessarily influence the controllers of Magellan and their advisers in
informing and/or advising their
shareholders about a future takeover offer by
Sagasco.  Sagasco argues that the takeover will proceed after the present
litigation
is concluded.  Magellan submits that it may not."</b>
<P>

77   	Her Honour then quoted from the judgment of McPherson J in
<b>Ex parte Fielder Gillespie Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20QdR%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2 QdR 339</a> at p.341, in which
passage his Honour noted that the Courts have to strike a balance between the
right to discovery for the purpose
of the litigation and the interest in
maintaining confidentiality in secret processes that may be used for purposes
of competition.
<P>

78   	After a consideration of further authorities White J
concluded, at p.43:-
<P>

<b>"I have concluded that the subject documents are directly relevant to some
of the matters in issue between the parties in the litigation
and that certain
aspects of them can be characterised as commercially sensitive such as to
attract the discretion of the Court to
make an order for restricted disclosure.
They are not of a technical nature such that Magellan's officials could form no
complete
evaluation of them without the assistance of experts such as is often
the case with trade secrets.  <u>It is highly undesirable that litigation
solicitors and counsel should be left without the benefit of instructions from
the client,
particularly in a situation as here where the issues are much more
subtle than a question of, for example, an infringement of a technical
process</u>.  This does not mean that the balancing process requires general
disclosure."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

I respectfully adopt her Honour's conclusions.  However, it seems to me, that
in the present case they apply with even greater force.
<P>

79   	As I have stated, on several occasions, the witness
statements were not brought into existence as part of the confidential
information utilised in the plaintiffs' business, but to provide the basis on
which the plaintiffs claim a vast amount of damages.
 Secondly, it is not
suggested that much of the material in the documents is not in the public
domain or, if not in the public domain,
not known to the defendants, nor that
it could not be similarly analysed by the defendants.  Thirdly, as I have
noted, the objection
to the production of the material is that it brings
together certain information, which is readily available, but in a form for
which
the plaintiffs seek to claim confidentiality because such material has
not been brought together in that form previously.  However,
that exercise has
been undertaken for the purpose of seeking to justify the Court in awarding the
substantial damages the plaintiffs
are seeking.  Fairness in the administration
of justice demands that all defendants have access to the witness
statements.
<P>

80   	In <b>Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc &amp; Ors</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20FLR%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 FLR 403</a> Hill J considered the question in relation to discovered
documents and having regard to ss.23 and 50 of the <b>Federal Court of
Australia Act</b> 1976.  I should note that neither party contended that my
decision rested on any statutory provision.  There was no argument that
the
Court has not the necessary jurisdiction, the issue being whether, for present
purposes, it is appropriate to exercise it.
<P>

81   	An issue in <b>Hadid</b> was the calculation of damages
allegedly suffered by Mr Hadid, on which issue expert evidence had been adduced
by the respondents
based to some extent on discovered documents sought to be
concealed from him.  The basis for that was that he was said to be a competitor
and that the information in the documents could be used disadvantageously to
the respondents.
<P>

82   	At p.406 his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"Whatever the source of power to deny access to documents otherwise relevant
to the proceedings, two policy considerations govern
the exercise of that
power.  First, is the concern of the Court to promote and ensure open justice.
As Gibbs J (as he then was) said
in <i>Russell v Russel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20134%20CLR%20495" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 134 CLR 495</a>
at 520, albeit in the context of the holding of proceedings in camera:</b>
<P>

<b>`It is the ordinary rule of the Supreme Court, as of the other courts of the
nation, that their proceedings shall be conducted "publicly
and in open view"
...  This rule has the virtue that the proceedings of every court are fully
exposed to public and professional
scrutiny and criticism, without which abuses
may flourish undetected.  Further, the public administration of justice tends
to maintain
confidence in the integrity and independence of the courts.  The
fact that courts of law are held openly and not in secret is an
essential
aspect of their character.  It distinguishes their activities from those of
administrative officials, for "publicity is
the authentic hallmark of judicial
as opposed to administrative procedure" ..."</b>
<P>

<b>Secondly, is the requirement, as a matter of procedural fairness, that a
party to proceedings has prima facie a right to access all
documents properly
discovered or produced before trial and all material in evidence at trial.
That right may be qualified in a number
of ways, for example it may be defeated
by a valid claim of legal professional privilege or public interest immunity.
Relevant to
the present case it may be qualified if, on balance, the interests
of justice require such a qualification.  However, generally speaking
it may be
said that it is fundamental that a party to a proceeding know the case sought
to be made against him or have access to
material which would enable him to
respond to that case.</b>
<P>

<b>However, as Lord Keith observed in <i>Harman v Home Office</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20AC%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 AC
280</a> at 308, in a passage cited with approval by Spender J in <i>Mackay Sugar
Co-operative Association Ltd v CSR Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2063%20FCR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 63 FCR 408</a> at 412:</b>
<P>

<b>`Discovery constitutes a very serious invasion of the privacy and
confidentiality of a litigant's affairs.  It forms part of ... legal
procedure
because the public interest in securing that justice be done between the
parties is considered to outweigh the private
and public interest in the
maintenance of confidentiality.'</b>
<P>

<b>Thus, where an application for confidentiality is made, consideration must
be given both to the public interest in open litigation
and the private
interests of those affected by the litigation, be they parties or persons
subpoenaed."</b>
<P>

At p.410 he said:-
<P>

<b>"The inspection of documents discovered is an inseverable part of the
process of discovery.  Frequently, perhaps indeed almost always,
the party to
the litigation will be the person best placed to form an assessment of the real
significance of documents produced,
whether that assessment is made for the
purposes of preparing an ultimate trial or for the purpose of prospective
settlement negotiations.
 Thus there is a clear prima facie right in a party to
litigation personally to inspect discovered documents.  <u>It is a far from
satisfactory answer to the abrogation of this prima facie right, that the legal
adviser to the party may be permitted
to inspect the document, for that adviser
is, if the client is restricted from inspecting the material, placed in the
difficult and
indeed sometimes impossible position where he or she cannot
obtain instructions</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>This prima facie right of a party to litigation to inspect documents
discovered by another party is related to the obvious right of
a party to
litigation to be apprised of the case which is put against him.  It is part of
the principles of procedural fairness which
are applied daily in our
courts.</b>
<P>

<b>Where confidentiality in documents is made out the prima facie right to
inspect discovered material and the prejudice to the party
against whom an
order denying access is sought, have to be weighed against the degree of
confidentiality made out and the prejudice
to the person seeking
confidentiality, if that confidentiality should be breached."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

83   	For all the reasons I have sought to explain it would be,
in my opinion, highly inconvenient and, to that extent, prejudicial
amounting
to procedural unfairness, to NAB, its officers and the personal defendants not
to have access to the statements which,
as I have sought to explain, require a
careful reading with other documents and with the information incorporated in
them.
<P>

84   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs have established
their claim for confidentiality as against NAB, its appropriate officers
and
the personal defendants.  Nor am I satisfied that unless less restricted
access, than that for which the plaintiffs contend,
is granted to the
statements it will be possible for the legal advisers and experts retained on
behalf of NAB and the personal defendants,
(and I have not overlooked that
there is no objection to their seeing the witness statements), obtaining proper
instructions.  In
my opinion, it would be quite inimical to the purpose of the
exchange of witness statements to restrict access in the manner suggested
by
the plaintiffs.
<P>

85   	The suggestion that the legal representatives of the
defendants should have to make known to those of the plaintiffs the areas,
even
in a general way, in respect of which instructions are being sought is, in my
opinion, an impermissible infringement on the
right of the defendants to
conduct their case as they see fit.  Even general information would alert the
plaintiffs to areas on which
the defendants were focussing, and provide a clue
as to the course being followed.
<P>

86   	On the other hand I consider that it is appropriate to
provide for some element of confidentiality and that, at least in the
first
instance, the parties should be subjected to undertakings as to confidentiality
in addition to the implied undertaking.  This
will preclude unfettered
dissemination of the witness statements, without denying the defendants the
right to consider them properly
and furnish proper instructions.  I consider
that NAB should nominate the officers whom it wishes to have access to the
witness statements,
at least in the first instance, and consideration can then
be given to the obtaining of appropriate confidentiality orders from them.
 I
have in mind, for example, that such officers should be provided with copies of
the statements on the basis that they do not take
further copies or disseminate
the information in the copies with which they are provided to other officers of
NAB save, of course,
for those to whom they are furnishing instructions and,
further, that at the conclusion of the proceedings the statements be returned.
In making the last observation I appreciate that by that stage it is highly
likely that the information will be in the public domain
in any event.  I do
not see how the case could be conducted where there is a limited claim for
confidentiality against certain defendants,
but such an all embracing one
against others.  It can hardly be that the evidence of the witnesses for the
defendants, against which
and whom no such restrictive order is made, will not
be available to the other defendants. Further, I consider that the personal
defendants should have access to the witness statements, subject to a
confidentiality regime.
<P>

87   	Even if the evidence were shrouded in some confidentiality
it would require an extraordinary case to deprive some of the defendants
of
access to:-
<P>

(a)	the evidence to be used against them;
<P>

(b)	the other evidence answering that evidence;
<P>

(c)	the Court where such evidence was being given;
<P>

(d)	the transcript relating to such evidence; and
<P>

(e)	the Court's judgment.
<P>

I do not consider this is such a case.
<P>

88   	I invite the parties to bring in Short Minutes of Order to
give effect to these reasons.
