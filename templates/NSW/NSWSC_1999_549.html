<b>JUDGMENT	(Proceedings be set aside - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> SCA)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 22 January 1999 the
first defendant seeks that the proceedings be wholly set aside or alternatively
that
the pleadings be wholly be set aside pursuant <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></b> (the Act).  The plaintiff Barbara Ann Beagan (now McCarthy) relied on
her affidavit sworn 13 May 1999 and three affidavits of the
her solicitor
Terence Leland Stern sworn 8 March 1999, 8 April 1999 and 6 May 1999.  The
first defendant relied on the affidavits
of Donald Allan Ross Munro sworn 20
January 1999 and 26 March 1999.  The plaintiff opposes the orders sought and
seeks an order pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7</a> r 7 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> (the
Rules) that the service of the statement of claim be extended up to and
including 2 December 1997.  If the proceedings are not
set aside against the
first defendant, all parties consent to this matter being transferred to the
District Court.
<P>

2 	Section 81 of the Act reads as follows:
<P>

<b>"Irregularity</b>
<P>

<b>81(1)	Where, in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any
stage in the course of or in connection with any proceedings,
there is, by
reason of anything done or left undone, a failure to comply with the
requirements of this Act or of the rules whether
in respect of time, place,
manner, form or content or in any other respect -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify
the proceedings, or any step taken in the proceedings, or
any document,
judgment or order in the proceedings; and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Court may, on terms, set aside
wholly or in part the proceedings or any step taken in
the proceedings or any
document, judgment or order in the proceedings or exercise its powers under
this Act and the rules to allow
amendments and to make orders dealing with the
proceedings generally.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Court shall not set aside any proceedings or any step taken in any
proceedings or any document, judgment or order in any proceedings
on the ground
of a failure to which subsection (1) applies on the application of any party
unless the application is made within
a reasonable time and before the
applicant has taken any fresh step after becoming aware of the
irregularity."</b>
<P>

3  	The parties agreed that the relevant authority for extending the
time for service of a statement of claim is <b><u>Rust v Barnes</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980)
2 NSWLR 727.</a>  In <b><u>Rust</u></b> Yeldham J dismissed an appeal from Master
Allen (as he then was).  The Master asked the question whether the effect of
Part 7 r 7
that there is no order which the court can make, or at least ought
to make, to cure the defect that the originating process had become
stale, for
the purposes of service, before it was in fact served?  His conclusion was that
he did not think so.  It should be noted
that Part 7 has been amended since
<b><u>Rust</u></b>.  Part 7 r 7(2) which said that "the court shall not extend
the period of two years" has been deleted and the time now allowed for
service
is one year.  However, it is common ground that at the relevant time, the
plaintiff had two years to effect service of the
statement of claim.
<P>

4  	Master Allen expressed the opinion that service of originating
process more than two years after the same was filed is a failure
in compliance
with the requirements of the rules which fails to be dealt with under s 81 of
the Act.  In the case before Master Allen,
if service was held to be invalid,
the plaintiff was in trouble because the limitation period had since expired.
Master Allen concluded
that the discretion conferred by s 81 of the Act should
be exercised in favour of the plaintiff.  The service, albeit irregular,
should
not be set aside.  The irregularity should be cured.  He did not consider that
there would be injustice to the defendant.
 Yeldham J agreed with this
reasoning. 
<P>

5  	It is common ground that if this matter is allowed to proceed to
trial, the plaintiff has an arguable case.  The plaintiff submitted
that the
operation of s 81(3) of the Act is mandatory and as the first defendant has not
taken action in a reasonable time and has
taken fresh steps on this basis he
cannot succeed under s 81(1).
<P>

6  	For the purposes of this application I find the following
facts.
<P>

(1)	On 24 September 1987 the plaintiff made a complaint to Ms Walton, Manager,
Complaints Unit Department of Health (CU).  The plaintiff
stated that she had
received iron injections some of which had been prescribed by Dr Kidd over a
period of 17 years.  However the
gravamen of her complaint appeared to relate
to  injections that she received in hospital in 1984.  It appears that 6 iron
injections
were given over a period of six days in August in 1984 which are
prescribed by Dr Kidd and administered by the nursing staff.  The
CU conducted
a inquiry and obtained a statement from Dr Kidd, Dr Wijesena dated 18 November
1987 and Dr Lindsay March dated 2 January
1988.  From the reports, Dr Wijesena
gave the plaintiff two iron injections between 28 December 1983 and 23 January
1984 and Dr Marsh
gave the plaintiff iron injections in 1984.  The complaint
was investigated and the CU found that there was insufficient basis for
disciplinary action against Dr Kidd for professional misconduct. 
<P>

(2)	On 2 June 1989 the plaintiff filed a handwritten statement of claim in
which she alleged that:
<P>

<b>"I was receiving iron injections over a 14 year period every day on 1
occasion or then weeks other times.  They were given every day
for a week at a
time and every day for 2 and 3 weeks at times.  In 1984, I went to see my
general practitioner, who after giving
me a number of injections himself,
refused to give me any more because of the state of my buttocks, then a few
weeks later I went
into hospital for an operation and I was given another week
of iron injections."</b>
<P>

The first defendant was Iain Harrison Kidd and the second defendant was the
Hunter Area Health Service.
<P>

(3)	From 1989 until 1991 the first defendant worked as a consultant
gynaecologist and obstetrician at King Faisal hospital, Khamis,
Mushayt, Saudi
Arabia and then worked for several months as a locum in Australia.  In 1991
until the end of 1992 the first defendant
worked as a consultant gynaecologist
and obstetrician at Curtis Memorial hospital, St Anthony Newfoundland Canada.
From 1992 until
approximately August 1996 the first defendant worked at the Red
and White Medical Centre, corner of Pacific Highway and Argyle Street,
Coffs
Harbour.  Details of the first defendant's positions of employment appeared in
the 1990, 1993 and 1996 editions of the Medical
Dictionary of Australia.  On 19
November 1992 the certificate of registration in New South Wales referred to
Iain Harrison Kidd's
address as being care of Beaumont, 35 Wiley Street,
Waverley.
<P>

(4)	On 15 February 1990 Hendriks Keulemans solicitors came on the record as
acting for the plaintiff.
<P>

(5)	On 15 December 1992 the plaintiff's then solicitor wrote to Dr Kidd at the
Waverley address referred to above and informed him
that a directions hearing
had been listed for 17 December 1992.  He requested that the first defendant
make contact with him (the
solicitor).
<P>

(6)	On 21 December 1992 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to Mrs Beaumont at the
Waverley address.  The letter referred to a telephone
conversation between
them.  Mrs Beaumont is Dr Kidd's eldest daughter.  The solicitor requested that
she either supply a forwarding
address for the first defendant, an
acknowledgment of service or seek instructions as to whether her father was
prepared to authorise
the Medical Defence Union to accept service on his
behalf.  No reply was forthcoming.
<P>

(7)	In 1992 and 1993 this matter came before the court on a number of occasions
for directions.
<P>

(8)	In 1991 Counsel had provided advice to the plaintiff's solicitor.  In
January 1993 Mr Eric Peterson of Counsel also provided
advice to the solicitor.
On 14 July 1993 the Legal Aid Review Committee allowed an appeal against
refusal of aid and granted an extension
of legal aid to permit the obtaining of
medical and experts reports.
<P>

(9)	On 13 April 1993 an amended statement of claim (ASC) was filed pursuant to
Pt 20 r 2 of the Rules.  In paragraphs (3), (4) and
(5) of ASC the plaintiff
alleges that in August 1984 she was admitted by the second defendant to its
hospital as a patient of the
first defendant and the first defendant performed
a hysterectomy on her.  She alleges that for a number of days after the
surgery,
and while she remained in hospital, she was given a number of
intramuscular injections of an iron supplement known as inferon by
the second
defendant's servants or agents acting under the direction of the first
defendant.  As a result of these injections she
alleges that she suffers
neuralgic injury to the right superior gluteal nerve and progressive atrophy of
the gluteusmedius and severe
gluteal muscle wasting on both sides and other
injuries and disabilities.
<P>

(10)	On 29 October 1993 the second defendant filed a defence to the ASC.  So
even if an order is made under s 81 of the Act in relation
to the first
defendant, this matter will proceed to trial as between the plaintiff and
second defendant.
<P>

(11)	On 17 April 1997 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to the Medical Defence
Union notifying it of the existence of the ASC.
<P>

(12)	On 12 May 1997 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to Tress Cocks and Maddox
and asked them whether they had instructions to accept
service of the ASC.
Shortly after the first defendant's solicitor asked the plaintiff's solicitor
for an explanation for the delay
in serving the statement of claim.  The first
defendant later wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor saying the explanation was
not satisfactory.
<P>

(13)	On 26 May 1997 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote again to the first
defendant's solicitor and stated that the plaintiff would
apply for leave to
serve a statement of claim outside the two year period pursuant to s 81 of the
Act. 
<P>

(14)	On 11 September 1997 the first defendant's solicitor wrote to the
plaintiff's former solicitor and said that it was impossible
for the plaintiff
to oppose any application pursuant to s 81 of the Act.
<P>

(15)	On 17 October 1997, Mr Keulemans filed a notice of ceasing to act as
solicitor.
<P>

(16)	On 31 October 1997 the plaintiff's new solicitors Stern and Tanner, wrote
to the first defendant's solicitor informing them
that that firm now acted for
the plaintiff.  Regular correspondence has been exchanged between the
plaintiff's current solicitor
and the first defendant's solicitor.
<P>

(17)	On 2 December 1997 the first defendant's solicitor advised the plaintiff's
solicitor that it had accepted service of the ASC
and a s 81 application should
be brought by the plaintiff without delay.
<P>

(18)	On 28 January 1998 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to the defendant's
solicitor and said that the service of the statement
of claim after the
expiration of two years from its issue was non-compliance with the procedural
requirement and the failure to comply
with the procedural step is an
irregularity and does not nullify the proceedings or the steps taken.  It put
the first defendant
on notice that the plaintiff considered that the obligation
fell on the defendant to file the motion if it wished to have the proceedings
set aside.
<P>

(19)	On 22 January 1999 the first defendant filed this notice of motion.
<P>

7  	The first defendant submitted that there is no evidence which
would satisfy the court that there is an explanation for the plaintiff's
gross
delay. The first defendant also submitted that it is prejudiced by the delay.
The plaintiff submitted that since her new solicitors
took over much activity
has taken place so that the plaintiff's case is now ready for trial.  According
to the plaintiff to set the
proceedings aside now would be harsh and unjust.
<P>

8  	The first defendant to the best of his recollection was first
consulted by the plaintiff while he was a partner in Andrew Nash
Clinic at
Wallsend and he left this group practice to go into full time specialist
practice as a gynaecologist and obstetrician at
the end of 1970 and says that
due to the effluxion of time he is heavily reliant on his notes and that the
notes prior to 1980 no
longer exist.  However the clinic notes of the first
defendant from after that date are available.  These notes cover the period
when the alleged cause of action occurred.
<P>

9  	The Health Insurance Commission does not have records of
consultations prior to 1 February 1984 and the first defendant cannot
make
further enquires as to who else may have treated the plaintiff prior to 1984.
The plaintiff has received other injections of
the same kind as the first
defendant allegedly prescribed and these injections were given by Drs Wijesena,
Pacey and Marsh.  The
plaintiff has been treated by at least 10 medical
practitioners between 1970 and 1994.  The defendant has subpoenaed the records
of these doctors.  Doctors Piddock and Stevens advised that there were no
documents to produce.  Dr Shortland and Dr Wijesena have
not been located.
However Dr Wijesena's report furnished in the Health Complaints Investigations
is in existence.  Dr Marsh and Dr
McMahon have produced documents in answer to
subpoena.  Dr Goldshaft and Dr Pacey have not responded to the subpoena.  Dr
Addinall
has sold his practice and the purchaser of the practice no longer has
any files relating to the plaintiff.  At this stage Dr Hardy's
records cannot
be located.  
<P>

10  	The first defendant also submitted that if the proceedings
continue, his capacity to thoroughly explore the involvement of
others will
forensically deny him the opportunity to fully defend himself on the crucial
issue of causation, insofar as that issue
will involve the acts and omissions
of others.  He also submitted that he may not be able to seek contribution from
others and a
costs order will not overcome the prejudice.  The first defendant
also submitted that the plaintiff has been secretive to her own
doctors which
hampers his ability to prepare the case.
<P>

11  	Section 81(1) states that failure to comply with the Act or
Rules whether in respect of time, place, manner, form and content
is to be
treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings.  
<P>

12  	I turn to consider my exercise of discretion under s 81(1)(b) of
the Act.  Although the plaintiff on her own evidence has had
numerous iron
injections over a period of 14 years, Dr Kidd in his letter dated 2 January
1988 denied administering any injections
to the plaintiff in his surgery from
1970 to 1984.  These records cannot now be located as I understand the
plaintiff case she is
not alleging that Dr Kidd gave her injections at his
surgery.  Rather the plaintiff confined her case to 5 or 6 injections she
received
by Dr Kidd while at Newcastle Western Suburbs hospital given by Sister
Caber under instructions from Dr Kidd.  The injections were
allegedly given on
12 August 1984, 13 August 1984, 14 August 1984, 15 August 1984 and 17 August
1984.  These clinical notes in relation
to this period of time are
available.
<P>

13  	The plaintiff's cause of action arose in August 1984 some 15
years ago.  The limitation period expired in August 1990 nearly
9 years ago.
The plaintiff filed a statement of claim on 2 June 1989.  She had until the 2
June 1991 to serve the originating process.
 On 13 April 1993 the plaintiff
filed an amended statement of process but it was not served until 2 December
1997 when Tress Cocks
and Maddox accepted service on behalf of the first
defendant behalf.  The originating process, namely the statement of claim was
never served.  The amended statement of claim (and I shall treat it as
originating process) was served over 6 years out of time.
<P>

14  	There are records concerning the cause of action in existence.
In 1987 the plaintiff made a complaint about Dr Kidd to the
CU of the Health
Department.  This complaint was investigated and copies of the investigation
are available.  The first defendant's
version of events form part of this
record.  The clinical notes which relate to the iron injections in 1984 are in
existence.  It
is not known if the first defendant' daughter informed the first
defendant of the existence of these proceedings in 1992.  The first
defendant
has not put on any evidence denying earlier knowledge of these proceedings.  As
previously stated the plaintiff filed the
statement of claim in 1989.  Her
husband provided a statement on 22 March 1998 and she had counsel's advice in
1991.  I accept that
the first defendant may face difficulties if he claims
contribution from other doctors who gave the plaintiff iron injections.  
<P>

15  	The plaintiff has employed at various times seven firms of
solicitors.  However it was not until 17 April 1997 that the plaintiff's
then
solicitor contacted the Medical Defence Union with whom the first defendant was
a member, concerning these proceedings.  Tress
Cocks and Maddox the solicitors
acting for the first defendant wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor on 17 April
1997.  There is no
satisfactory explanation as to why the plaintiff's then
solicitor took no steps to serve the first defendant with the statement of
claim and subsequently the ASC between 21 December 1992 and 31 October 1997.
Nor is there a satisfactory explanation as to why the
plaintiff's solicitor did
not seek an order for substituted service on the plaintiff's daughter or the
Medical Defence Union.  
<P>

16  	There is to be a trial between the plaintiff and the second
defendant in any event.  It is not clear whether the blame for
this lengthy
delay in serving the statement of claim lies with the plaintiff or her then
solicitor or both.  The plaintiff was having
difficulties obtaining legal aid.
In 1997 the plaintiff's then solicitor was requested to explain the delay in
serving the statement
of claim and amended statement of claim but did not
satisfactorily do so.  It is unfortunate for the parties that this delay
occurred.

<P>

17  	In <b><u>Morrison &amp; Anor v Judd</u></b> (NSWSC, Master
Malpass unreported 10 October 1995) the issue was whether an application for
substituted service and leave to serve
a statement of claim more than two years
after the filing should be granted.  The Master said that he should have regard
to the possibility
of a good cause of action against the plaintiff's solicitor,
but it is not a matter to which the court can give great weight.  On
appeal to
a single judge Spender J said that the consideration of an action against a
solicitor was irrelevant.  In the Court of
Appeal, Kirby P wrote the leading
judgment with which Meagher and Powell JJA agreed.  Kirby P said:
<P>

<b>"The Master was clearly right to take into account the absence of any
explanation for the delay in prosecuting the claim.  It is rudimentary,
when
evaluating the requirements of justice, to consider the explanations which a
party offers (if any) for the failure to conform
to the requirements of the
Supreme Court Rules that cases be prosecuted with due diligence.  Where there
is no explanation, a party
is left bereft of excuse.  As between that party and
the contesting parties, it is then more difficult to demonstrate that justice
requires the relevant extension.</b>
<P>

<b>It is natural to a court, striving for justice, to be disinclined to exclude
from a hearing on the merits, a person who has put her
confidence in legal
representatives and instructed them within time to bring her claim.</b>
<P>

18  	Kirby P also said:
<P>

<b>"My own opinion is identical with that of Lord Salmon in the House of Lords
and of Lush, Gray and McGarvie JJ in Victoria.  The availability
of an action
against a negligent legal representative is relevant because common sense says
that it is so.  It means that the litigant,
who may be wholly or mainly
innocent, is not put out of court without some chance of redress, however
difficult that chance may be
to enforce.  To that extent an injustice, which
might otherwise occur to the litigant, may be capable of being avoided."</b>
<P>

19  	I have taken into account that absence of an explanation for the
delay in prosecuting the claim and that the plaintiff may
have an action
against her former solicitor.  
<P>

20  	The plaintiff has served a large number medical reports since
January 1998.  These cover the plaintiff's medical condition
between 1986 to
date.  It is my view that the first defendant is not significantly prejudiced
by the delay.  The exercise of discretion
under s 81(2) of the Act in this
matter is finely balanced.  I have taken all the factors referred to above into
account and reflected
upon them carefully.  It is my view justice falls on the
side of the plaintiff.  She should be allowed to proceed with her somewhat
difficult case against the first defendant.
<P>

21  	If I am wrong I turn to consider s 81(3) of the Act.  The
plaintiff submitted that the first defendant's solicitor foreshadowed
a motion
seeking to set aside proceedings since November 1997 yet did not do so until 22
January 1999, some 14 months later.  This
according to the plaintiff cannot be
considered as occurring within a reasonable period.  The plaintiff also
submitted that the first
defendant had elected to take fresh steps in the
proceedings so the court is precluded from setting the proceedings aside by
virtue
of s 81(3).  The first defendant submitted that 14 months was a
reasonable period particularly as he sought an explanation from the
plaintiff's
solicitor for the delay prior to taking the foreshadowed action.  The first
defendant submitted that it has not taken
a fresh step in the proceedings, but
merely taken action consistent with preparing this motion for hearing.
<P>

22  	In my view the defendant has not taken action beyond preparing
this motion for hearing.  The first defendant's solicitor accepted
service of
the ASC but before doing so had drawn to the plaintiff's attention that the
statement of claim was stale.  The first defendant
put on an appearance, filed
the motion and issued subpoenas to ascertain what medical records are still
available. It is my view
that the defendant has not taken a fresh step after
becoming aware of the irregularity.
<P>

23  	By 11 September 1997 the defendant's solicitor had decided that
the plaintiff's former solicitor offered no satisfactory explanation
for the
delay in serving the originating process.  However the defendant's solicitor
did not take any action until 2 February 1999
when he filed the motion seeking
an order pursuant to s 81 of the Act.  A period of 15 months elapsed. In my
view in the circumstances
of this case the period of 15 months cannot be
considered a reasonable period of time.  It appears that the first defendant
was waiting
for the plaintiff to file a motion pursuant to s 81 of the Act but
this does not excuse the first defendant's failure to act, particularly
if he
seeks to obtain the benefit of s 81(3).  
<P>

24  	I have read the notes appearing at the foot of s 81(3) in
Ritchies Supreme Court Practice where it says that these two requirements
are
cumulative and cites recent examples of this proposition namely <b><u>Brennan v
Brennan</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1953/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1953] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%2089%20CLR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 89 CLR 129</a> and <b><u>Wentworth v Rogers (No 1)</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 642.</a>  Neither of these cases specifically refer to s 81 of the
Act.  It is my tentative view (as it was not argued before me) that in
order
for the defendant to be precluded from having proceedings set aside he must not
have firstly made the application within a
reasonable time and secondly must
have taken a fresh step in the proceedings.  As the defendant has fulfilled
only one of the criteria
he does not fall within s 81(3) and is not precluded
from having the proceedings set aside.  The same considerations that I have
taken into account when deciding whether the proceedings should be set aside
also apply to the determination of the issue as to whether
time for service of
the ASC should be granted.  For the same reasons, it is my view that time for
service of the amended statement
of claim should be extended to 2 December
1997.  The appropriate order for costs is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

25  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Time for service of the amended statement of claim is extended to 2
December 1997.
<P>

(2)	The first defendant's notice of motion filed 22 January 1999 is
dismissed.
<P>

(3)	Matter to be transferred to the District Court, Sydney Registry.
<P>

(4)	Costs be costs in the cause.
