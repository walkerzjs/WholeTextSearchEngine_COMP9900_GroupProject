<b><u>70022/99 Patrick Hudd - Application pursuant to s 474D of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a></u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	This is an application pursuant to s 474D of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act 1900</a></i> which provides that an application for an inquiry into a
conviction may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person.  Section
474E provides that, after considering an application under s 474D, the Supreme
Court may direct an inquiry or refer the whole case
to the Court of Criminal
Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act
1912</a></i>.
<P>

2   	The application was made by Legal Aid New South Wales on
behalf of the applicant, Patrick Hudd, by letter dated 9 March 1999.
 The
letter sets out the circumstances of the case and the grounds on which the
application is made.
<P>

3   	There is a need for urgency in dealing with this matter.
The applicant was convicted in the District Court on 26 August 1993.
 On 1
November 1993 he was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and six months
dating from 27 September 2000, with an additional
term of ten months.  The date
for commencement of the sentence was fixed by reference to a sentence being
served.  On 5 December
1995, the applicant was re-sentenced by the Court of
Criminal Appeal to a minimum term of one year and four months commencing on
10
March 1999 and expiring on 9 July 2000, with an additional term of two years
commencing on 10 July 2000.  Accordingly, at the
time when the application was
lodged, the relevant sentence was about to commence and the applicant has now
served about three months
of that sentence.
<P>

4   	An adequate reason for the delay in making the application
has been provided in a letter from Legal Aid New South Wales dated
25 March
1999.  
<P>

5   	Notwithstanding the need for urgent attention to the
application, I thought it was necessary to give the Crown the opportunity
of
making submissions pursuant to s 474E(4).  Correspondence between the registrar
and the Crown Solicitor's Office culminated in
a letter dated 1 June 1999 as
follows:
<P>

"My officer has considered the application lodged on behalf of the abovenamed
dated 9 March 1999 and the material referred to therein.
 Having received the
advice of junior counsel and the Crown Advocate, the Crown does not wish to
file written submissions in opposition
to the course suggested by the applicant
(that is, to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal).  The Crown
would regard
it as quite inappropriate to order an Inquiry.
<P>

It is accepted that the fresh material sought to be relied upon by the
applicant is of a character that could satisfy the relevant
test propounded by
s 474E(2), particularly insofar as it relates to the words `a doubt or question
as to ...any part of the evidence
in the case."
<P>

6   	As at 1 June 1999, I was engaged in a heavy criminal trial
and was unable to give attention to this application.  No other
judge was
available.
<P>

7   	I agree with the submission made by the Crown Solicitor
that it would be inappropriate to order an inquiry in this matter.
<P>

8   	I note the observation by the Crown Solicitor that the
fresh material sought to be relied upon by the applicant is of a character
that
could satisfy the relevant test propounded by s 474E(2), particularly insofar
as it relates to the words "a doubt or question
as to ...any part of the
evidence in the case".  Having regard to the matters stated in the letter of 9
March 1999, I am satisfied
that there is such a doubt or question.
<P>

9   	In terms of s 474E(1)(b) I order that the proceedings be
referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal
under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a></i>.
