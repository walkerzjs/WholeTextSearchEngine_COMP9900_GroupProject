<P>

FRIDAY 17 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>21240/1995</u>	<u>STEPHEN STANKOWSKI v THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This proceeding is yet another of the many arising out of the
collision between HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager on 10 February
1964.  The
process was filed on 29 November 1995.  A Notice of Motion was filed on 6
December 1995.  It makes application for an
order extending the relevant
limitation period.
<P>

2  	The Notice of Motion was heard on 15 December 1999.  There is
affidavit material from the plaintiff.  There is exhibited material
(from both
the plaintiff and the defendant).  There was lengthy cross-examination of the
plaintiff.
<P>

3  	The defendant did seek to rely on two affidavits sworn by Mr
Ktenas (a solicitor for the defendant).  These affidavits were
said to have
relevance to matters of prejudice.  Both had been belatedly sworn after 22
October 1999 which was the date on which
the court had allocated a special
fixture for the hearing on 15 December 1999.  The special fixture had been
allocated after the
legal representatives for the parties had signed the usual
special fixture form.  The form states in bold letters that the fixture
is
allocated on the assurance of the parties that all affidavits to be read have
been filed and served.  It also contains the notation
that "Only affidavits on
file when the matter is specially fixed may be read".  The defendant had been a
party to many similar hearings
and was fully appraised of the practice of the
court in relation to special fixtures.  Certain of the material contained in
the affidavits
related inter alia to inquiries made and information received
prior to the date of allocation of the special fixture.  No satisfactory
explanation was offered for the failure to prepare this material prior to the
obtaining of the special fixture.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff objected to the reading of the affidavits.  The
tender of the affidavits was rejected.
<P>

5  	Apart from the flagrant disregard of the assurance given to the
court and the practice adopted by the court in relation to special
fixtures,
the affidavits contained material which would have required investigation and
consideration by the plaintiff and perhaps
the adducing of further evidence to
meet the material.
<P>

6  	Following the rejection of the tender, the defendant then made
application for adjournment.  The purpose of the adjournment
was to enable the
defendant to rely on the rejected material at some future time (I might add
that the defendant had some weeks earlier
made a belated application for
adjournment on the hearing day, without any prior notice, in another of the
"Melbourne" matters).
 The special fixture document also contains the notation
that "It can be assumed that no adjournment will be granted".  Any question
of
adjournment should have been raised at a much earlier time so as to avoid
prejudice and inconvenience to the plaintiff and the
disruption of the court's
business.  The plaintiff had come from South Australia for the purposes of the
hearing.  The defendant
had required him to attend for purposes of
cross-examination.  The application was refused.
<P>

7  	I should add that these applications considerably lengthened the
hearing time of the application itself (when ultimately the
court was able to
start hearing it).  Also, they caused considerable disruption to the conduct of
the other business which the court
was required to deal with on that day.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff was born on 20 April 1945.  He became a member of
the Royal Australian Navy on 8 January 1961.  At the time of
the collision, he
was a member of the crew of HMAS Melbourne.
<P>

9  	The affidavit material sets out the experiences had by the
plaintiff in relation to the collision.  There is material relating
to his
subsequent career in the Navy.  There is material dealing with his employment
history after leaving the Navy.  He left the
Navy on 7 January 1973.
<P>

10  	He has experienced symptoms since the collision.  He regarded
the symptoms as normal and did not think that there was anything
wrong with
him.  Following the collision, in addition to those symptoms, he developed a
drinking problem.  He had an awareness of
connection between these matters and
the collision.
<P>

11  	In about 1995, his wife saw an article in a newspaper or
magazine.  She asked him to contact James Taylor (the plaintiff's
present
solicitor).  Eventually he acceded to this request.  He was referred to Dr Wu.
Dr Wu informed him that he was suffering from
a psychiatric disorder.  Dr Wu
prepared a report dated 1 February 1996.  The plaintiff said that he did not
know that he was suffering
from a post traumatic stress disorder until he saw
Dr Phillips (a psychiatrist engaged by the Commonwealth Government).  It
appears
that Dr Phillips has prepared a report.  It has not been tendered by
the defendant.
<P>

12  	Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u>
1969</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a> prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> unless the
Court is satisfied of the matters set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subsection (1) thereof.  These are threshold
requirements to the making of an
order.  When the threshold requirements have been satisfied, there is a
discretionary power to grant
relief.  The court must decide whether or not it
is just and reasonable to make an order.
<P>

13  	Generally speaking, it could be said that the application has
been opposed on all fronts.  It is said that the plaintiff has
failed to
satisfy any of the threshold requirements.  Further, it is said that he has
failed to satisfy the court that it would be
just and reasonable to make an
order.
<P>

14  	I have had regard to all of the evidence before the court on the
hearing of this application.  In particular, I have had regard
to such
inconsistencies as may have emerged between oral evidence and other material.
In my view, the defendant's submissions fail.
<P>

15  	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the relevant threshold
requirements.  Similar considerations have been addressed
in previous cases
(including <u>Darcy v The Commonwealth of Australia</u> (25 July 1997) and
<u>Burns v The Commonwealth of Australia</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/223.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 223).</a>  It suffices to
specifically mention that I am satisfied that the requirement appearing in (a)
(ii) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1) has been met.  I am satisfied that, despite his knowledge as
to symptoms, he was unaware that he had a psychiatric condition
prior to seeing
Dr Wu (see inter alia <u>Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56 FCR
389).</a>  In these circumstances, it is not necessary to consider submissions made
in respect of (i) and (iii) thereof.  Further, I am satisfied
that this
application has been made within the 3 year period prescribed by (1) (b).
<P>

16  	The defendant has placed emphasis on the discretionary
considerations of delay and prejudice.  Indisputably, there has been
delay
which has occasioned prejudice.  In the relevant circumstances of this
particular case, I do not regard the delay and prejudice
as having sufficient
weight as to lead the court to a rejection of the application.  A rejection
would deny the plaintiff the opportunity
to prosecute his claim for damages.
The court is not in a position to form any view as to the potential of that
claim but it can
be said that it may be a quantum of significance.
<P>

17  	I should perhaps make further mention of one aspect of the
prejudice argument.  The plaintiff may propound a claim for loss
of earning
capacity.  During a period of between about 1973 and 1979, the plaintiff had a
number of jobs of relatively short duration.
 Certain of the jobs were
terminated either by the plaintiff leaving the job or being retrenched.
Although there is no evidence to
this effect, it may be that the employers lack
relevant records.  It may be that any lack of records can be overcome by other
material.
 Whatever be the position, it has relevance only to a modest
component of any claim made for loss of earning capacity.  Since 1979,
the
plaintiff has been in continuous employment with the same employer.
<P>

18  	There is presumptive prejudice.  However, despite the matters of
prejudice, I am of the view that a fair trial of the relevant
issues can still
take place.
<P>

19  	The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the court that he has
an entitlement to relief.  In the relevant circumstances of
this case, I am
satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

20  	Accordingly, I have reached the decision that it is just and
reasonable to make the order sought and that such an order should
be made in
this case.
<P>

21  	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded
in the Statement of Claim up to and including 29 November 1995.
 I reserve the
question of costs.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
