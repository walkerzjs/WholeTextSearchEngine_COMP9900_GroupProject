<b>Judgment (On application by Commissioner of Police to adjourn
cross-examination of Messrs Angus, Bell and Woodhouse)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: It was during Thursday 25 March that there arose during the
cross-examination of Mr Howard Charles Bell, the Senior
Legal Officer of the
Police Service of this State, the matter of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.
That matter is dealt with in my ruling and directions of that date (NSWSC 259
DLJT: 28). 
<P>

2	Consequent upon the matters referred to in that judgment, Mr Muddle of
Counsel this morning appears for the Commissioner to seek
to have adjourned the
cross-examination of Mr Bell essentially to enable his client, the
Commissioner, to be properly apprised of
the matters referred to in my judgment
of 25 March and to be advised in relation to them.
<P>

3	The Commissioner being a person exercising an undoubted right to claim
privilege in relation to documents sought from him, Mr
Muddle appears as a
result of the withdrawal of the persons hitherto representing the police in
circumstances where their conduct
as legal officers and practitioners,
vis-a-vis the Commissioner, and in the context of any dealings, to use that
term in a neutral
way, between the Commissioner and the defendant, have been
called into question. I am of the view that that is a perfectly understandable,
acceptable and necessary development.
<P>

4	Counsel for the plaintiff and for the defendant, each for their client,
resists the application made by the Commissioner, for
the plaintiff on the
basis that time will be available to the Commissioner in any event over today
and tomorrow, by reason of the
continuation today of the cross-examination of
Mr Angus and the cross-examination of Mr Woodhouse. In any event a question is
raised
by the plaintiff as to the standing of the Commissioner to participate
in the cross-examination in any way of those two persons.
I do not understand
the plaintiff to be making the same complaint in relation to the Commissioner's
standing with respect to Mr Bell.
<P>

5	The defendant, consistent with an anxiety on the part of both sides that the
defendant's application to amend be dealt with, also
presses for the
continuation of the cross-examination of Mr Angus and the institution of the
cross-examination of Mr Woodhouse, but
additionally seeks to preclude the
plaintiff in the course of those cross-examinations from pursuing the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a>
line, if I might so shortly describe it.
<P>

6	 The defendant cannot be said to have been taken by surprise by the
connection of the cross-examination of Mr Angus as it has
hitherto developed
with matters generally in issue in an application of its kind.  The defendant
certainly cannot be surprised by
the plaintiff having moved to set aside the
defendant's subpoena to the Commissioner. The element of surprise is
constituted by the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> component with which I dealt on 25 March. That
component however is fundamental to the plaintiff's application, so it seems,
to have
set aside the subpoena and hence as I gather the pursuit of it to the
point reached when Mr Bell's cross-examination was suspended.
<P>

7	Much reliance is placed upon the fact that written submissions of the
plaintiff were delivered some time ago, submissions covering
the plaintiff's
opposition to the defendant's substantive motion to amend and purporting to
cover also the plaintiff's claim to have
set aside the subpoena to the
Commissioner - that is the 8th factor on page 15 of those submissions.
<P>

8	Mr Muddle rightly has characterised that which is inherent in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a>
matter as raising matters of the utmost gravity. I don't see how they could be
characterised differently. They are as grave in relation
to the Commissioner
and his then legal advisers as they are apparently important to the plaintiff
in opposing the defendant's amendment
and in having set aside the defendant's
subpoena to the Commissioner.
<P>

9	With respect to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> component, I gather that particulars have been
provided to the Commissioner in accordance with the direction I gave on 25
March.
A question has arisen as between the Commissioner and the plaintiff as
to their adequacy and that question must be resolved.
<P>

10	First, I reject the contention for the defendant that the cross-examination
of whomsoever today was to be cross-examined by the
plaintiff should be
constrained by the elimination of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> component.  Second, as is apparent,
if what counsel for both the plaintiff and the defendant have said today, the
"<i>area</i>" susceptible to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> considerations will of necessity arise
during the cross-examination of Mr Angus and no doubt unquestionably arise in
the cross-examination
of Mr Woodhouse.
<P>

11	Whilst the Commissioner can make arrangements to observe those
cross-examinations, that, at this point of time, would be of little
or no
utility to the preparation by the Commissioner of his position in relation to
pursuit of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> issue via Mr Bell. Notwithstanding protestations of notice
as between the plaintiff and the defendant, I have no hesitation in describing
the intrusion of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> component as explosive, the fall-out from which
detonation clearly involving the Commissioner.
<P>

12	I propose to accede to the Commissioner's application to this extent today.
I will make arrangements through my Associate that
whomsoever is instructing Mr
Muddle is to be provided with the transcript of the evidence given by Mr Angus
to date and the revised
judgment handed down on 25 March. I will entertain no
further application in relation to any component of this litigation between
now
and 2pm. On the assumption that within one hour that material will be made
available to those instructing Mr Muddle. He can consider
it  and inform the
Court at 2pm further as to his position in the light of it. The Court will have
business tomorrow with which it
can proceed, that business being constituted,
as I understand it, by certain medical evidence. But I propose to immediately
adjourn
this matter to 2pm and Mr Muddle's instructing solicitors can make
immediate contact with my Associate with respect to the timing
of the provision
of the material in the interim.
