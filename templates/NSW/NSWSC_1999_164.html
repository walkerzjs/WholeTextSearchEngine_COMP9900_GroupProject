<b>JUDGMENT (On procedure regarding plaintiff's claim for privilege)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: Since approximately 11 o'clock this morning, I have been reading
some material. The broad context is an application
by the Defendant to amend
its Defence.
<P>

2	Within that context, material has been sought from both the Police Service
and the Plaintiff, giving rise to a claim for privilege
by the Plaintiff.  
<P>

3	In respect to components of each group of material I have read but subject to
any questions of admissibility, an affidavit of
Michael Brian Joshua Lee sworn
1 March 1999, an affidavit of the same person sworn 2 March 1999 and what are
described as a confidential
exhibits, an affidavit of Brian James Whittaker
sworn 1 March 1999 and confidential exhibits constituted by some individual
documents
but principally, by two folders of documents, one BJW1, being the
documents in respect of which privilege is claimed.
<P>

4	In respect of the subpoena directed to the plaintiff, BJW4, is a folder of
documents in respect of which privilege is claimed,
being documents produced by
the Police Service. 
<P>

5	I do not pretend to have read every word of every document but merely to have
gone through the respective bundles, at the very
least to gain some idea as to
their overall nature.
<P>

6	I am of the view that the disposition of the question of privilege is of
critical importance, as one way or the other, it should
lead to a finalisation
of the status of the Defendant's application to amend its Defence, thus the
exposure of the issues on the
pleadings, certainly to that point.
<P>

7	Accordingly, if the plaintiff proposes to pursue his claim for privilege,
then the evidence in support thereof, should be read
and dealt with, the
evidence in opposition should be read and dealt with and I will hear
submissions.
