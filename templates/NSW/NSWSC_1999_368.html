<b>3052/97 - ROGERS &amp; ANOR  V KABRIEL &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :   </b>The first plaintiff, a quite wealthy lady, controls the
second plaintiff, a proprietary company.  The first defendant is a film
producer
who is the leading light in the third defendant.  The second defendant
is an accountant and financial adviser.  He acted as such
for both the
plaintiffs and the third defendant.
<P>

2	Mr B A Coles QC and Mr A P Coleman appeared for the plaintiffs.  Mr P Le G
Brereton SC and Mr D P M Ash appeared at the hearing,
for the first defendant,
Mr Kabriel, and the third defendant, Fontana Films Pty Ltd to which I will
refer simply as "Fontana Films"
or "Fontana".  The written submissions were
signed by Mr Brereton SC alone.  The second defendant, Mr Prasad, appeared in
person.
<P>

3	The plaintiffs complain about two transactions, the first which occurred
about 17 September 1996 (the "First Transaction"), they
say had the effect of
depositing $650,000 into Fontana Films' bank account.  The plaintiffs wish to
recover it, either as money had
and received or otherwise.
<P>

4	The other transaction took place on 16 October 1996 when the second plaintiff
"invested" $1m with Fontana Films in connection
with a film, (the "Second
Transaction").
<P>

5	As I said, the first plaintiff controls the second plaintiff.  For
simplicity, I will simply refer to "the plaintiffs".  The plaintiffs'
interests
sold a business for $36m, of which the first plaintiff received $27m.  By
September 1996 the first plaintiff had lost confidence
in her advisers and was
suspicious of her daughter.  She was friendly with the first defendant Mr
Bedrich Kabriel, and he suggested
that the second defendant, Mr Narendra
Prasad, was a good accountant who could advise Mrs Rogers.
<P>

6	In September 1996, the plaintiffs were purchasing a property in the Southern
Highlands and required $650,000 to complete the purchase.
<P>

7	Mrs Rogers first met Mr Prasad on 4 September 1996 and was interested in
having him be her financial adviser.  She met Mr Prasad
for the second time on
7 September 1996 when she signed two authorities, authorising Mr Prasad to
exercise authority over her monies
in quite wide respects.  Mr Prasad advised
Mrs Rogers that she had a considerable tax problem and prepared investment
plans.  Included
amongst these was a suggestion that an investment in the film
industry would be a good idea.  At this time Mr Prasad gave Mrs Rogers
four
copies of the prospectus for the film "The Ugly Dumpling" and he says he told
Mrs Rogers "This is the type of document which
is issued when the film is
made".
<P>

8	Arrangements were then made for Mrs Rogers to see Mr Seller, a  solicitor who
is a partner in the firm of Gadens.  Mr Prasad at
least saw Mr Seller and gave
him some material which referred to "The Ugly Dumpling" and also provided
provisional certificates in
respect of about five films including the film
"Skar".  It is doubtful whether Mr Bedrich Kabriel attended the conference at
Gadens.
 Mr Seller's evidence was quite unsatisfactory generally and he
provided the only evidence that Mr Kabriel did attend that conference.
<P>

9	On 13 September 1996, Mrs Rogers attended a meeting at Mr Seller's office
with Mr Bonnell and Mr Kabriel.  Mr Prasad was there
though Mrs Rogers does not
recollect his presence.  Mr Prasad raised the topic of film investment and said
that he proposed to put
Mrs Rogers into a film scheme, though he was not sure
which, and asked Gadens to advise her.  In due course Gadens advised that Mrs
Rogers should not take any steps with respect to film investment until a due
diligence review of the documents could be undertaken
so that Gadens could give
her concluded advice.
<P>

10	On 16 September 1996, Mrs Rogers and Mr Prasad met at Quay West and walked
down to the Advance Bank where they met a manager,
Mr Stephenson.  Mr Prasad
wrote out a cheque for $15m,  Mrs Rogers signed it and handed it over to Mr
Stephenson.  Mrs Rogers and
Mr Prasad then went down to the National Bank,
where the manager, Mr Davenport, refused to release the money.  
<P>

11	On that day at the Advance Bank, Mr Prasad prepared two withdrawal slips for
$650,000 each.  Mrs Rogers can only remember signing
one authority for $650,000
but the surrounding material shows she signed two.  I found Mrs Rogers to be
very vague in giving her
evidence and reached the conclusion that it would be
unsafe to rely on many of the statements she made unless they were
corroborated.
  Mr Prasad says that Mrs Rogers told him, "I'd like to invest in
the film.  Can I invest $1.3 million?" to which Mr Prasad replied,
"No Rick
does not need that money" and Mrs Rogers then allegedly said, "Can I put half
in it and half extra, and you make sure that
the other half extra $650,000 goes
into a fixed deposit, so it's instantly available".
<P>

12	Mr Prasad's evidence was hard to accept.  He represented himself.  At p 99
of the transcript Mr Prasad indicated that he wished
to make a statement.  I
advised him as to his liability to be cross examined and he then said that he
did not want to give evidence.
 Mr Brereton SC then called Mr Prasad to give
evidence in the case of the other defendants and he was examined orally in
chief by
Mr Brereton SC for about three-quarters of an hour.  Mr Coles QC
cross examined him for about five minutes.   The witness then requested
and was
granted, a five minute adjournment.  About five minutes after resuming the
witness was seen to be continuously rubbing his
forehead with his right arm,
his speech was slow and a couple of minutes after that the witness said he was
sorry he could not answer
any more questions and that he was ill.  The matter
was then adjourned to the next day.   A medical report was tendered on the next
day which showed that Mr Prasad had suffered severe heart failure attacks and
suffered from a mild degree of dementia associated
with increasingly severe
short term memory changes.  The doctor reported "<b>All in all,</b> I recommend
that he be regarded as a not reliable witness in court, and respectfully
request that in interest of his health he be
excused court attendance."
<P>

13	This leaves me in a very odd situation.  As I said during submissions, I do
not think that I can disregard the whole of Mr Prasad's
evidence.  I would
certainly pay attention to it if it contained admissions against Mr Prasad, but
the rest of the evidence must
have very little weight in view of the facts that
the evidence was not cross examined and the doctor's view that Mr Prasad is an
unreliable witness.  However, there were some parts of Mr Prasad's evidence
where he was able to look at documents and give some
explanation.  Some of that
evidence, I think, is credible.  On the other hand, I would be very loath to
accept Mr Prasad's evidence
as to conversations he had with anyone else in the
case.
<P>

14	I will shortly deal with the two separate transactions, but before I do I
should make mention of some evidence which was undisputed
and which forms part
of the background to the transactions.
<P>

15	Mr Bedrich Kabriel, who has been a director of the third defendant Fontana
Films since 20 August 1968, first met Mrs Rogers in
the mid to late 1960s when
he was making a commercial for one of the products that her former company was
promoting.  They became
friendly and in 1982 Bedrich Kabriel joined a group of
advisers to Mrs Rogers known as "the Cenovis Advisory Group Committee".  When
Mrs Rogers was experiencing difficulties with her accountants she asked Mr
Kabriel for advice, and it was he who suggested the services
of the second
defendant.  Mrs Rogers first met Mr Prasad at Mrs Rogers' Quay West apartment
when he was introduced by Mr Kabriel.
 Mrs Rogers appointed Mr Prasad her
financial adviser and accountant without more enquiry.  
<P>

16	It is alleged by the plaintiffs that the relationship between Mr Kabriel and
Mrs Rogers was such that he could reasonably be
treated as a fiduciary who had
agreed to act on behalf of Mrs Rogers and to be her adviser.
<P>

17	On 7 September 1996, Mrs Rogers gave Mr Prasad two authorities, the first
which is headed "Authority to Act and or Give Instructions"
is addressed to Mr
Prasad and confirms Mrs Rogers' authority for him to act on her behalf and on
behalf of associated companies in
relation to any dealings with banks,
accountants and other institutions.  The second headed "Acknowledgment and
Authority to Give
and Receive Information" acknowledges that Mrs Rogers has
appointed Mr Prasad for financial and taxation advice and authorises him
to
seek or give information and use that information regarding Mrs Rogers'
"personal and business affairs and associated companies
for the purpose of
deposit of funds and banking facilities".
<P>

18	In cross examination, Mrs Rogers was asked about these documents.  Mr
Brereton SC put:  "When you signed the second of the documents
...  you
understood you were authorising Mr Prasad to act on your behalf?"
<P>

	A.	"Yes".
<P>

	Q.	"You understood that you were authorising him to act on your behalf in
relation to any dealings with Gadens?"
<P>

	A.	"Yes".
<P>

	Q.	"And to act on your behalf, and on behalf of any of your associated
companies in relation to any dealings with any other institutions
that he deems
appropriate?"
<P>

	A.	"Yes".
<P>

	Q.	"And you understood that by signing that you were giving him a very wide
scope of authority to make decisions on your behalf?"
<P>

	A.	"That's right".
<P>

19	In that background I must examine the two transactions and I believe that
the most convenient way to do so is to deal with them
and the other questions
that arise in these proceedings under the following headings:<b> </b>
<P>

	1.	An overview of the facts and the witnesses.
<P>

	2.	The First Transaction.
<P>

	2A.  	The claim by the plaintiffs against Mr Prasad in respect of the First
Transaction.
<P>

	2B.     The claims by the plaintiffs against the First and Third Defendants in
respect of the First Transaction.
<P>

	3.    	The Second Transaction.
<P>

	3A.	Findings of fact with respect to the Second Transaction.
<P>

	3B.	Was the investment  tax deductible?
<P>

	3C.	The claim against Mr Prasad regarding the Second Transaction.
<P>

	3D.	The claims against Fontana Films regarding the Second Transaction.
<P>

	3E.	The claim against Mr Kabriel regarding the Second Transaction.
<P>

<b>	</b>4.  	The claim against Fontana Films under the Corporations Law.
<P>

	5.	The Result of the case.
<P>

20	<b>1.      An overview of the facts and the witnesses</b>
<P>

	The hearing took two days before me last October.  It was then necessary to
stand the matter over until December because of Mr
Prasad's condition. Counsel
then prepared written submissions over January and spoke to them on 10
February 1999.  A minor loose
end was dealt with on 11 February.  I then
commenced writing these reasons, but ran into difficulties and called for
further written
submissions if either or both counsel wished to do so.  They
both did so, the final submission reaching me on 11 March.  Those submissions
were most helpful.  In accordance with modern practice, they were supplied in
hard copy and on disk to make them easier to incorporate
into the final version
of the reasons for judgment.
<P>

21	Although I accept generally the evidence that Mrs Rogers gave, I do not
accept it in its entirety.  As I have already mentioned,
I found that much of
her evidence was very vague and gave the indicia of a person who had been on
the sideline rather than in the
heat of the action.
<P>

22	Mr Prasad gave evidence in a way that made me think that he was frightened
of something, though I do not know of what.  As appears
from earlier in these
reasons, he indicated he wanted to give evidence, Mr Brereton SC cross examined
him under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  When it was Mr Coles QC's turn to
cross examine, Mr Prasad became too ill to continue.  I thus have to evaluate
his evidence in
a special way.
<P>

23	Mr Kabriel gave evidence in a confident manner and was not affected by cross
examination.  Although there was a considerable
amount of debate in the written
submissions on both sides as to whether his evidence should be accepted, I have
little hesitation
in accepting his evidence.  I also accepted the evidence of
Mr Devos, though I suspect that he was confused as to what meeting was
what.
As in most cases, there were a number of supporting witnesses.  I was not
impressed with the evidence of Mr Seller, the solicitor,
whose memory was weak
on this matter.   I do not need to mention the other incidental witnesses:
generally I accepted their evidence.
<P>

24	<b>2. 	The First Transaction</b>
<P>

	<b>2A.  	The claim by the plaintiffs against Mr Prasad in respect of the First
Transaction</b>
<P>

25	It is first necessary to examine the facts in a little more detail. On 17
September 1996 an amount of $650,000 was withdrawn
from the account of the
second plaintiff at the Advance Bank, Account No 44078230. This was achieved by
way of the withdrawal and
deposit forms signed in blank by Mrs Rogers. The only
part of those documents which bears Mrs Rogers' handwriting is the signature.
At the time of the withdrawal and deposit of the $650,000 from the second
plaintiff's bank account into Fontana Films' bank account,
Mr Prasad was
engaged or contracted by Fontana Films as its financial adviser or financial
controller.  Mr Prasad's specific role
was to raise money on behalf of Fontana
Films for the production of films. 
<P>

26	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman submit that Mrs Rogers did not authorise the
withdrawal of $650,000 from the second plaintiff's bank
account or for those
funds to be deposited into Fontana Films'  bank account and only discovered the
deposit of the money into Fontana
Films' account in January 1997.  I am not
satisfied that this is completely so.  
<P>

27	There is no doubt that an amount of $650,000 was placed on term deposit with
the Advance Bank into Contract No 96057043 by Mr
Prasad.  This money was
eventually used to settle the purchase of the Southern Highlands property.
There is also no doubt that a
second sum of $650,000 was withdrawn from the
second plaintiff's account on the same day and paid to Fontana Films.
<P>

28	Mr Coles, QC and Mr Coleman put that it should properly be  inferred that Mr
Prasad took advantage of the instructions he was
given to set aside $650,000 as
a cloak for the unauthorised misappropriation of an identical sum on that day.
They put that this
inference is supported by Mrs Rogers' evidence that the fact
of the withdrawal was concealed from Mrs Rogers when Mr Prasad (after
some
prompting) finally supplied her with a statement of account for monies he had
apparently spent purportedly on her behalf.  However,
whilst I generally agree
with Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman for the reasons they give in their written
submissions that Mr Prasad's
evidence on the matter is implausible, I could not
be confident of accepting Mrs Rogers' evidence on this point.
<P>

29	There is no doubt that Mrs Rogers appointed Mr Prasad as her financial
adviser and accountant and vested him with some authority.
The real question
is: what authority did he have?  I have already referred to the two Authority
Documents and to Mrs Rogers' evidence
in respect of the authority that she
considered that Mr Prasad possessed.  Mrs Rogers specifically said in her
affidavit that Mr
Prasad had no authority to enter into the First Transaction.
I think that is more a statement of belief and that I really need to
examine
the documents in the surrounding circumstances. 
<P>

30	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman say that the Authority Documents relied on by
Fontana Films are insufficient authority.  I would agree;
their basic thrust is
to permit Mr Prasad to gather and give information, not to allow him to make
investments.  It is difficult
to treat Mr Prasad as having ostensible authority
because he was acting for both sides of the transaction and thus both sides
knew
the exact state of his authority.
<P>

31	Plaintiffs' counsel say that even on Mr Prasad's own version (upon which he
has declined to submit himself for cross examination)
of the deposit of the
$650,000 is that on an occasion not otherwise elaborated upon at the Advance
Bank, Mrs Rogers is supposed to
have said:-
<P>

	"Yeah, I'd like to invest in the film. Can you do it now, and put a further
$650,000 deposit ..."
<P>

	or -
<P>

	"Can I invest $1.3m into this account?"   
<P>

32	Plaintiffs' counsel submit that this account is highly implausible and
should be rejected for at least three reasons:-
<P>

(a)	It is inherently unlikely that Mrs Rogers would initiate a proposal to
invest or agree to invest in a film on 17 September 1996,
three days after the
meeting attended by her at Gadens on 13 September 1996. Objectively the
evidence discloses that although there
was only a brief discussion about films
at that meeting, Mr Seller's advice to her, which she accepted, was that any
investment in
film should be delayed until a proper due diligence was
completed;
<P>

	(b)	Mr Prasad's version is inherently inconsistent. On the one
<P>

	hand, it is said that he attended a meeting with Gadens and
<P>

	provided them with documents in relation to a film investment of
<P>

	$1.3m by Mrs Rogers and yet, Mr Prasad asserts that when Mrs
<P>

	Rogers asked if she could invest $1.3m into Fontana Films'
<P>

	account he said, "No, Rick does not need that money";
<P>

	(c)	No receipt or other acknowledgment was issued for the $650,000 either then
or at any other time.
<P>

33	I agree with this submission for the reasons put forward.  Furthermore,
there is no evidence as to the terms on which the $650,000
was "invested" with
Fontana Films.  The highest that the evidence goes was that the money was to be
invested in a film, but this
is rather nebulous.  Even if the money was to be
invested in the film "The Ugly Dumpling', it would not assist the defendants as
the prospectus had expired and the money in fact was not "invested" in that
film. 
<P>

34	Mr Brereton SC says that the inference must be that the investment was made
as a film investment.  I do not see how I can accept
this on the facts.  There
was not even the pretence of taking the money on the basis of an application in
a prospectus, there is
nothing to show that the plaintiffs were to get the
documentation that they would need to prove a tax deduction for a film
investment
and there was no attempt by Fontana Films to use the money for its
own film production.
<P>

35	The most likely scenario is that Mr Prasad either considered that the
"investment" was in Mrs Rogers' interest or else the needs
of Fontana Films
outweighed all other considerations in his mind.  I will, for the moment assume
the former.  Thus, I will consider
the case on the basis most favourable to Mr
Prasad. 
<P>

36	Basically, the situation is that Mr Prasad, in breach of the terms of his
agency agreement with the plaintiffs, took it upon
himself to "invest" $650,000
of the plaintiffs' money in Fontana Films.  The plaintiffs have sought to
recover that amount from Fontana
Films.  For the reasons given in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p2b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2B</a> of
these reasons, I have held they are entitled to do so.  There must, however, be
some doubt as to the ability of Fontana Films
to satisfy any judgment. On that
basis, the plaintiffs have suffered loss.  That loss is the present assessment
of the likelihood
of shortfall which will need to be assessed by a Master if
needs be.
<P>

37	The next question is whether that loss was a result of Mr Prasad's actions.
The allegation is that the "investment" was not in
the interests of either of
the plaintiffs.   That is probably correct, at least on the facts as are now
known, but Mr Prasad may
well have thought that he was so acting.  However, the
duty of the agent was, in the words of Article 38 of the 17th ed of
<b>Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency (</b>Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1996)<b>
</b>"to act in accordance with the terms of (his) contract and not exceed his
authority."  The agent who thinks that he is acting in the
best interests of
the client, but is not acting within the terms of his contract is liable to the
principal if damage ensues.  This
was laid down in <b>Fray v Voules
</b>(1859)<b> </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1859/540.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1859] EngR 540</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20E%20%26%20E%20839" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 El &amp; El 839</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=120%20ER%201125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">120 ER 1125</a> and has been recently applied
by the Court of Appeal in <b>Donellan v Watson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20335" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 335</a>, 342.
Thus, despite Mr Prasad's intention, he was not acting within the scope of his
authority and accordingly is liable for any
loss caused by his actions.   
<P>

38	It might be said that this simple cause of action was not pleaded. However,
in my view it is implicit in what is pleaded in paragraph
17 of the second
further amended statement of claim.
<P>

39	Thus the result is that there should be damages for breach of Mr Prasad's
duty in an amount to be assessed by a Master.
<P>

40	This conclusion really makes consideration of the other ways in which the
case was put academic, but I will briefly consider
them in case this matter
goes further.
<P>

41	The plaintiffs' chief submission is that Mr Prasad committed a fraud on Mrs
Rogers.  The primary way this is put is that in making
the representation that
it was his intention to use the withdrawal and deposit slips Mr Prasad caused
Mrs Rogers to sign in blank
only for the purpose of facilitating the purchase
of Frogmeadow (the property in the Southern Highlands that Mrs Rogers was
acquiring)
when that was not his intention. That representation was made with
the intention that Mrs Rogers act on it by signing the withdrawal
and deposit
slips and, as a result of Mrs Rogers so acting, the plaintiffs have suffered
damage, namely the loss of the $650,000.
 Counsel referred to<b>  Krakowski v
Eurolynx Properties Ltd </b> (1995) 183 CLR 563.  As I have said earlier, I do
not accept this version of the facts.
<P>

42	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman then put that the plaintiffs are entitled to
recover the $650,000 from Mr Prasad as a cause of action
lies in debt against a
thief:  <b>Chowne v Baylis</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1862/897.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1862] EngR 897</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281862%29%2031%20Beav%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1862) 31 Beav 351</a>, 358;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1862/897.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1862] EngR 897</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=54%20ER%201174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">54 ER 1174</a>, 1177.
They put that it should properly be inferred that Mr Prasad took advantage of
the instructions he was given to set aside $650,000
as a cloak for the
unauthorised misappropriation of an identical sum on that day. They further say
that it is very significant that
the withdrawal was concealed from Mrs Rogers
when Mr Prasad (after some prompting) finally supplied her with a statement of
account
for monies he had apparently spent purportedly on her behalf.  
<P>

43	The statement of law is correct, but is irrelevant for two reasons.  First,
the facts as I have found them do not support it.
 Secondly,  the charge
against Mr Prasad is acting fraudulently and without authority, not theft.   I
agree that there is a very
significant difference in law between stealing money
and obtaining money by means of fraudulent misrepresentation. With the first,
there is no parting with property; with the second, there is a transfer of
property, subject to the transaction being avoided.  This
distinction is vital
in cases where a third party obtains title from the wrongdoer before the
transaction is avoided;   see eg <b>Phillips v Brooks Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1919%5d%202%20KB%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1919] 2 KB 243.</a>

<P>

44	A further alternative claim is that Mr Prasad breached his fiduciary
obligations to the plaintiffs and the defendants are not
entitled to retain the
monies which passed to Fontana Films as a result of this breach.
<P>

45	It is conceded that Mr Prasad owed duties of a fiduciary nature to the
plaintiffs.  Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman put that Mr Prasad's
liability as an
errant fiduciary does not depend on whether he received or benefited from the
proceeds of his breach.  Mr Prasad
in fact gained significant personal
advantage from this transaction. He secured the viability of his principal
employer, Fontana
which was then able to pay its debts. As financial controller
of the third defendant, his success in raising money would result in
the
payment of a commission to him.  It was in this sense that Mr Prasad stood to
gain a benefit from his actions and thus placed
himself in conflict of his duty
to Mrs Rogers and his potential to gain a benefit from his breach.  They
further put that it is a
misconception to regard the ambit of the defaulting
fiduciary's liability as being dependent upon or limited to those cases where
he is liable to account for a benefit or gain to himself.  This is correct up
to a point, but the fiduciary's liability is to account
for his own personal
profit or gain (in this case his secret commission) rather than the whole
capital sum processed by him: <b> Chan v Zacharia</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 178</a>, 199.

<P>

46	Mr Brereton SC puts that the $650,000 transaction involved no breach of
fiduciary duty on the part of Mr Prasad.  He says that
in recommending the
$650,000 investment, Mr Prasad committed no breach of fiduciary duty.  He made
no benefit or gain from the transaction,
for which he could be held liable to
account. There was no conflict between his duty to his principal, ie the
plaintiffs, and his
personal interest.  At the highest there was a conflict
between his duty to his principal the plaintiffs, and his duty to his principal
the third defendant, but in those circumstances all he could be held liable for
is compensation for any loss consequent upon preferring
Fontana Films'
interests to the Rogers' interests; and as the whole purpose of the transaction
was to gain a tax deduction by making
an expenditure of capital, it is
impossible to see, at least at this stage, that there has been any loss.
Advantage to Fontana Films
was not personal advantage to Mr Prasad; to the
extent that it is suggested that he stood to gain a commission by preferring
his
duty to Fontana Films over his duty to Mrs Rogers then his liability as an
errant fiduciary, if that he be, would be to account to
her for any such
commission.
<P>

47	When considering the actions of a person who can be categorized as a
fiduciary, it is important not to be caught up in "unthinking
resort to verbal
formulae" and to remember that "not every breach of duty by a fiduciary is a
breach of fiduciary duty":   <b>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew
</b>[1998] Ch 1, 16 and see <b>Permanent Building Society v Wheeler </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2014%20ACSR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
14 ACSR 109</a>, 157-8.  However, in the present case, the alleged breaches are of
a conflict of interest and duty type and so fall under the classic
principles.
<P>

48	In my view, the submission of Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman is correct.
However, Mrs Rogers must have known of the connection between
Mr Prasad, Mr
Kabriel and Fontana Films.  The only thing that was concealed was the
commission that Mr Prasad was getting for his
fund raising efforts.  Thus, the
success of the submission merely leads to the requirement that Mr Prasad
account for his commission
which really gets no-one anywhere as it would not
appear that the commission was very much and the claim in breach of duty as an
agent would  mean that it may be disregarded.
<P>

49	The result thus is that the plaintiffs are entitled to damages against Mr
Prasad for breach of his duty as their agent to keep
within his authority.  The
quantum may be fixed by a Master.
<P>

50	<b>2B.  	The claims by the plaintiffs against the First and Third Defendants
in respect of the First Transaction</b>	 
<P>

	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman say that on any view of the evidence, the receipt
and use by Fontana Films of the $650,000 is a straightforward
case of monies
had and received.  They cite<b> James v Oxley</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2061%20CLR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 61 CLR 433</a> where the
recipients had <u>not</u> received any benefit from the money but were
nevertheless liable because the funds in question had been sufficiently under
their
control so as to constitute a receipt. They put that the position would
have been a fortiori if the recipients had known of and used
the money for
their own benefit.
<P>

51	I cannot, with respect see that <b>James'</b> <b>case</b> gives any
assistance in the present litigation.  In that case, the money was received by
a firm of solicitors for the plaintiff and
was paid out without authority
because of the fraudulent statement of a clerk to the solicitor drawing the
cheque to withdraw the
funds.  It has nothing to say with respect to when Y an
authorised agent of X pays money to Z intending that the moneys will be Z's
property from which Z will make profits and from which profits X will benefit.

<P>

52	Plaintiffs' counsel contrast the present case with the situation in
<b>National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Ltd v Batty </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
160 CLR 251</a>, where, owing to the fraud of another, a person had money paid into
his account, from which it was thereafter withdrawn, in each
case without his
knowledge (eg at pp 260-269).  Counsel say that the situation in the current
case is the converse to the observations
of Gibbs CJ at p 269  that "where the
defendant has not had the benefit of the money, has not played any part in
disposing of it
and was ignorant of the fact that it was theoretically under
his control, he should not be liable in the absence of fault on his
part".
Again, on the facts as I have found them, the plaintiffs derive no solace from
these words.	
<P>

53	Mr Brereton SC says that "The $650,000 was not received by Fontana Films to
the use of the plaintiffs, but to Fontana's own use.
 The $650,000 was received
by Fontana Films as a film investment, for taxation purposes.  In return for
it, the plaintiffs were entitled
to an interest in the copyright in the film to
be produced, from which they might generate income in the future.  The money
was invested
for Fontana to spend."  Later on he says, "The circumstances
surrounding the plaintiff's investment...as both parties should be taken
as
knowing that her purpose was to gain a tax deduction, give rise at least to an
implied contract by which she expended the moneys
by way of contribution to the
cost of producing a film to be produced by Fontana."
<P>

54	As I have already indicated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p2a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2A</a> of these reasons, I cannot see any
such implied contract.  The investment in films is a technical matter to be
dealt with by persons
experienced in the pitfalls.  It is an investment which
to be at all protected needs to be supported by provisional certificates
and a
prospectus.   The investor needs to have units in a scheme which will entitle
her to rights in respect of the copyright in
a film, usually a particular film.
I find it impossible to imply from the mere fact of investment of $650,000 even
in the atmosphere
of wanting a tax deduction that Mrs Rogers bought units
giving her rights to copyright in a film.  A fortiori this is so when the
"investment" was made immediately after the consultation with Gadens about film
investment which recommended caution. The only conclusion
that I can form is
that the money was paid over for a consideration which failed. This category
includes cases where the money was
paid over as part of a transaction which was
never consummated.
<P>

55	Where money is paid over in respect of a transaction which is not
consummated, the payer is entitled to repayment, and, if this
is not
forthcoming, to recover it as money had and received. 
<P>

56	Whichever rational  way one treats the plaintiffs' case, one gets to the
same result.  If Mr Prasad  was not authorised, then
the plaintiffs can recover
back the money paid as money had and received.  If Mr Prasad had authority to
"invest" the money with
Fontana Films, the terms of the investment were so
vague, (ie "Would you like to invest in a film?") that the transaction would
have
to be one where the transaction was never consummated and the money paid
is recoverable.
<P>

57	Mr Brereton SC says that this is not a case of "money had and received."  He
puts that it is necessary to carefully identify
the basis upon which the claim
is put.  He says that whilst there is no doubt in Australian law, where money
has been stolen, it
is trust money in the hands of the thief who cannot divest
it of that character,  <b>Black v S Freedman &amp; Co</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2012%20CLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 12 CLR 105</a>,

payment procured by a misrepresentation - even an intentional one - has that
consequence.  That is because where
money is paid under a legally effective
transaction, neither mistake nor misrepresentation vitiates consent or gives
rise by itself
to an obligation to make restitution:  that obligation flows if
at all from the ineffectiveness of the transaction if it is rescinded:

202</a>, 208. 
<P>

58	I believe that this submission is correct as far as it goes, but irrelevant.
There is a vital distinction between theft of money
and obtaining money through
false pretences, which I have already discussed.  However, when, as here, no
third party has taken title,
it is a distinction without a difference. 
<P>

59	Mr Brereton SC then puts that the $650,000 was not received by Fontana Films
to use of the plaintiffs, but to Fontana Films'
own use.  He says that the
$650,000 was received by Fontana Films as a film investment, for taxation
purposes.  In return for it,
the plaintiffs were entitled to an interest in the
copyright in the film to be produced, from which they might generate income in
the future.  The money invested was Fontana Films' to spend.  Unfortunately for
this submission, it is just not borne out by the
facts. This is not a case
where there was a properly documented transaction with receipt of moneys after
application on a prospectus
with the payer receiving a document that she was a
unit holder in an investment scheme with a share of copyright.  The plaintiffs
received nothing: Fontana Films just spent the money.
<P>

60	Then it is put that the restitutionary count for "money had and received"
does not outflank and supersede the principles enunciated
in <b>Barnes v Addy
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%209%20LRCh%20App%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 9 Ch App 244.</a>  If it did, then there would never have been a need
for <b>Barnes v Addy</b>, at least in its first limb, since "money had and
received" would always have been available, even without the element of
knowledge
which <b>Barnes v Addy</b> requires.  If the plaintiffs can rely on
"money had and received" here, those long established principles will be
defeated by a side-wind.
If the "money had and received" doctrine is capable of
application at all in this type of case, it does not found relief here.
<P>

61	This, to my mind is just a red herring. There is no need ever to invoke
<b>Barnes v Addy</b>.<b>  </b>There was a direct payment to Fontana Films in
circumstances where Mr Prasad, the agent for both parties knew the full
circumstances.
The purpose for which the money might have been paid was never
consummated.  The money must be returned.
<P>

62	Mr Brereton SC put that it is fundamental to the claim for money had and
received that the payment of the $650,000 to Fontana
Films was not authorised
by the first plaintiff.  If it was an authorised payment as a tax investment,
no question of money had and
received arises.  I do not accept this submission.
Even if it were correct, the payment was not a deductible film investment for
the reasons set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3B</a>, so that it is no answer to the plaintiffs'
claim.
<P>

63	The next submission is that in any event, it would be unjust to require
Fontana Films to repay the $650,000 in circumstances
where it has arranged its
affairs on the basis that it had received the money regularly, and applied it
to the payment of its debts
and the production of "Skar".  It is put that the
plaintiffs' claim was a restitutionary claim and in such a claim the defendant
may defend by showing that the payee had adversely changed its position in
reliance on the payment.  This was because, it was said,
Fontana Films had
changed its position by proceeding with the production of "Skar" and expending
the funds which it held in Czechoslovakia
for that purpose, reliant upon the
knowledge that monies including the $650,000 had been raised.
<P>

64	Assuming, without deciding whether the facts behind this submission have
been established, the question is whether it would amount
to a defence.  
<P>

65	The defence has its genesis in the view of Lord Mansfield when he had the
law recognize the common money count for money had
and received in <b>Moses v
Macferlan </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1760/713.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1760] EngR 713</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281760%29%202%20Burr%201005" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1760) 2 Burr 1005</a>, 1010;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1760/713.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1760] EngR 713</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=97%20ER%20676" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">97 ER 676</a>, 679, that a defendant sued
in money had and received was in fact advantaged as he could rely on any
available equitable defence
to show that he was not bound in equity to repay.
See the 5th ed of <b>Goff &amp; Jones on Restitution  </b>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
London, 1998)<b> </b>Ch<b> </b>40.<b>  </b>The defence usually only features in
a case of recovery of money paid under a mistake.  There is no reason in
principle why it should
not operate on a wider basis at least to cover the case
of money had and received after a total failure of consideration.  It is
common
ground that it does not apply to a straight out claim for recovery of money
lent.
<P>

66	In <b>David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
175 CLR 353</a>, 384-6,<b> </b>the High Court accepted that the defendant may
defend a claim for repayment of monies paid to it under a mistake of fact by
showing
that it had adversely changed its position as a result of the payment.
The final words of that summary are important.  The High Court
actually said,
at page 385, "...the defence of change of position is relevant to the
enrichment of the defendant precisely because
its central element is that the
defendant has acted to his or her detriment on the <i>faith of the
receipt</i>... the common element in all cases is the requirement that the
defendant point to expenditure or financial commitment which can be
ascribed to
the mistaken payment."  At page 386 the judges conclude, "In no jurisdiction,
however, can a defendant resort to the
defence of change of position where he
or she has simply spent the money received on ordinary living expenses."  See
also <b>State Bank of NSW Ltd v Swiss Bank Corp </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2039%20NSWLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 39 NSWLR 350</a>, 357.
In this respect, English authorities should be read with care as the vital
element of reliance does not appear as such in the
consideration of many of
them, see <b>Goff &amp; Jones </b>op cit at page 822. <b> </b>
<P>

67	Although the scope of the defence is not at this stage fully mapped out, the
commentators are agreed that not every case where
the defendant has spent the
money received will provide him or her with a defence.  In summary, mere
expenditure will not constitute
a change in position, the defence is not
available when the defendant has simply spent the money received on ordinary
living expenses.
 There must be a change in position, not just an adjustment of
lifestyle.  Further, the money should be spent solely in reliance
on the
payment.  That is, but for the payment and the defendant thinking that it was
richer than it was it would not have made the
expenditure.  Finally, the
defendant must not have knowingly contributed to the making of the payment.
See <b>Mason and Carter, </b> <b>"Restitution law in Australia"
</b>(Butterworths, Sydney, 1995)<b> </b>[2407], [2415]-[2418]<b>;</b>  KG
Nicholson "Recovery of Money Paid Under a Mistake of Fact"<b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2060%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 60 ALJ
459</a>, 464-5.
<P>

68	The facts as to the disposal of the $650,000 are fairly clear.  The money
was paid into Fontana Films' account with the Advance
Bank.  At that date, that
account was in overdraft in the amount of $144,852.  The account had an
overdraft limit of $100,000. Immediate
payments of $225,000 were made to
support a related company Manifesto Films Pty Ltd which made commercials and
$43,000 was paid for
the purchase of a motor vehicle.  Within four weeks, the
$650,000 had all been spent and the balance immediately before the deposit
of
$1m as a result of the Second Transaction was made up of three sums deposited
after the $650,000 deposit.
<P>

69	As the High Court pointed out in the <b>David Securities case</b>, in Canada
and in some parts of the United States, the defendant must point to a specific
expenditure being incurred because of the
payment.  Whether this is so in
Australia has yet to be determined.   Mason and Carter op cit take the view
that this is an unnecessary
restriction, see [2416].  I will assume that their
view is correct for present purposes, without deciding the point.
<P>

70	However, even making this assumption, I cannot see the factual material from
which I should find that these payments were made
in reliance of the payment of
the $650,000.  The onus appears to be on the defendant, but, even apart from
the question of onus,
the facts just show that the bulk of the money was
absorbed in repaying an overdraft, restructuring the group (or at least
supporting
an associated company) and purchasing a motor vehicle.  Thus, I do
not find the defence made out.
<P>

71	It is really unnecessary to consider the other causes of action relied on,
but, in deference to counsel I will briefly do so.

<P>

72	Plaintiffs' counsel put that there has been a knowing receipt by the third
defendant of monies misappropriated by Mr Prasad from
Mrs Rogers.  Thus the
monies bore and maintained the character of trust monies in his hands.   His
payment of such monies to a third
person did not divest the monies of their
character as trust money unless the recipient shows that his receipt was bona
fide for

any misappropriation, this head of claim fails. 
<P>

73	Next, plaintiffs' counsel mount an argument based on the principle in
<b>Haywood v Roadknight </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1927/74.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1927] VicLawRp 74</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%20VLR%20512" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927] VLR 512.</a>  The principle is that if A relies
on B in its dealings with C and knows that B is in a fiduciary relationship
with C, then, if B
abuses the fiduciary relationship with C, A will not be
permitted to benefit from that abuse.  In the present case, counsel say that
those in control of Fontana Films knew the source of the money, namely that it
had come from Mrs Rogers. They knew that Mr Prasad
who had obtained the
"investment" was a fiduciary qua Mrs Rogers. That amount injected a large
amount of cash into Fontana Films'
bank account, cleared its overdraft and
enabled it to pay its creditors and transfer money to Manifesto Films Pty
Limited.  Alternatively,
Mr Prasad's knowledge of the facts in his capacity as
financial controller or fundraiser for Fontana Films was knowledge which he
was
under a duty to disclose to Fontana Films, and accordingly, such knowledge is
imputed to that company;  see <b>Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams
Furniture Ltd </b>[1980] 1 All ER 393, 404.
<P>

74	Mr Brereton SC submits that this argument is not open to the plaintiffs on
the pleadings. I do not need to consider that submission
as the argument cannot
succeed in the scenario where the facts are that Mr Prasad acting under his
general authority from Mrs Rogers
vested the moneys in Fontana Films by way of
a bad investment, because there was no breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>

75	So far as Mr Kabriel personally is concerned, I cannot see any basis for
liability over the First Transaction.  Mr Brereton SC
submits that even taking
the plaintiffs' case at its highest, Mr Kabriel is not liable for participation
in any knowing receipt by
Fontana Films of the $650,000.  There is nothing to
suggest that Mr Kabriel participated in any relevant way or had any relevant
knowledge at all. 	
<P>

76	I should note that Mr Brereton SC submitted that any accessorial liability
of Fontana Films could not exceed that of Mr Prasad.
 For the reasons I have
already given, I do not accept that proposition.
<P>

77	<b>3.     The Second Transaction</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>It is necessary to deal with the Second Transaction in five parts,
viz:
<P>

<b>	</b> 3A.	Findings of fact;
<P>

<b>	</b> 3B.	Was the investment  tax deductible?
<P>

<b>	</b> 3C.	The claim against Mr Prasad; 
<P>

<b>	</b>3D. 	The claims against Fontana Films; and 
<P>

<b>	</b>3E.  	The claim against Mr Kabriel<b>.</b>
<P>

78	<b>3A.    Findings of fact</b>
<P>

	The Second Transaction involves the $1m paid to Fontana Films in October
1996.
<P>

79	The factual background is that on 16 October 1996, a meeting was held at
Quay West attended by Mr Prasad, Mrs Rogers and at which
Mr Kabriel later
arrived.  The plaintiffs say that Mrs Rogers was induced at that meeting to
provide a $1m cheque by virtue of the
representations by Mr Prasad that:
<P>

	(a)	there would be available to her considerable tax advantages for investing
in a film;  and
<P>

	(b)	the investment would be by way of subscription in "The Ugly Dumpling Film
Fund".
<P>

80	There is no doubt that Mrs Rogers provided the $1m and that it was paid into
Fontana Films' bank account on 17 October 1996.
<P>

81	The plaintiffs say that each of these representations was false.
<P>

82	Again, I am hampered by the view that I have taken of the credibility of the
principal witnesses Mrs Rogers and Mr Prasad.  I
can really only rely on the
objective facts and inferences as to why those facts came to pass.  
<P>

83	I agree that as Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman submit, the plaintiffs paid $1m
on terms that would be inexplicable unless they were
led to expect that the
expenditure would produce taxation advantages. Indeed, each of the defendants
does not appear to dispute,
and even embraces, this as the plaintiffs'
purpose.
<P>

84	The key question is whether the plaintiffs invested their money in the film
"The Ugly Dumpling" later renamed "Love Until". 
Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman say
that this question must be answered, "Yes", while Mr Brereton SC says that the
investment was merely
in tax deductible film and that it was appropriate for
the investment to be utilized as it was by Fontana Films freeing up funds
in
Czechoslovakia to pay part of the production costs of the film "Skar".
<P>

85	Mrs Rogers' evidence as to the 16 October meeting is that:-
<P>

	(a)	It was at the request of Mr Prasad;
<P>

	(b)	Mr Prasad raised the prospect of her investing in films to minimise
tax;
<P>

	(c)	During that conversation, Mr Kabriel arrived following which Mr Prasad
said to Mr Kabriel that it was a good idea for Mrs Rogers
to invest $1m in his
film fund;
<P>

	(d)	Mr Kabriel said, "If its good for Joan then I agree;
<P>

	(e)	Mr Prasad then said you will be investing in a film called "The Ugly
Dumpling" and then handed Mrs Rogers a copy of the prospectus
for "The Ugly
Dumpling";
<P>

	(f)	Mrs Rogers then handed a cheque for $1m to Mr Prasad. 
<P>

86	Mr Prasad's version of the 16 October meeting is that he had been
recalculating the amount of Mrs Rogers' income, taking into
account an amount
of $5m which was on deposit in the Kogarah branch of the National Australia
Bank and earning interest.  He asserted
that Mrs Rogers needed to invest a
further $1m because there had been short provision for her tax. 
<P>

87	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman put that this account is wholly implausible as it
is improbable that a deposit of $5m at the interest
rates at which Mr Prasad
said he could obtain would generate enough income so as to require a $1m tax
deduction.  They say that it
is a fabrication by Mr Prasad that a $1m
investment was required to alleviate any tax burden of the alleged deposit
sitting in the
Kogarah branch.  There was no reason as at 16 October 1996 why
Mrs Rogers needed to expend such monies at all.  It was eight and
a half months
before the end of the relevant financial year, most film investments being made
at the very end of the financial year.
<P>

88	They further submit that Mr Kabriel's version of the 16 October meeting in
which he claims he was wholly disengaged from the
process, is also implausible.
They put that it is absurd for Mr Kabriel to assert that although he knew
nothing about Mrs Rogers
investing in Fontana Films, after the 16 October
meeting he went back to his car and exclaimed that he had told Mr Prasad that
he
did not want Mrs Rogers involved in film financing. They say it is also
implausible to maintain that Mr Prasad had said "Rick will
do whatever he can
to help" when Mr Kabriel apparently constantly expressed a specific desire that
Mrs Rogers <u>not</u> invest in his films. He did <u>not</u> say anything to
that effect to her on 16 October 1996 even when he realised the topic of
discussion was her investing in films.
<P>

89	In my view the first plaintiff's version is more likely to be correct. There
is no doubt that Mrs Rogers was provided with copies
of the prospectus for "The
Ugly Dumpling" at the meeting on 16 October 1996.  Indeed, Mr Prasad says he
gave her four copies.
<P>

90	Secondly, Mrs Rogers obviously took some interest in "The Ugly Dumpling" as
she has written inside the copy of the prospectus
that is exhibit PX10 the new
title, "Love Until".
<P>

91	Thirdly, it is common ground that she retained possession of the prospectus
and took it to a later meeting at the premises of
Fontana Films at Turella.
<P>

92	Fourthly, the whole flavour of Mrs Rogers' evidence is that she placed store
by the  fact that there was a prospectus in respect
of her investment.  My
criticisms of Mrs Rogers' evidence do not extend to rejecting the central core
of her evidence.  I accept
her evidence that she would not have signed the
cheque for $1m had no prospectus been given to her.  I also accept her later
evidence
that she put store on the issue of the prospectus because it showed to
her that it meant that there was a genuine investment opportunity
and that
Fontana Films  were honest and they had nothing to hide.
<P>

93	Fifthly, at no time did counsel for Fontana Films ever put to Mrs Rogers
that she was content to have her money deposited to
the general account of
Fontana Films, and expended for its general purposes. The evidence does not go
far enough to show she assented
to the manner in which the moneys were in fact
applied. 
<P>

94	<b>3B.    Was the investment tax deductible?</b>
<P>

	It is necessary to explore whether, if the defendants' case is correct, the
plaintiffs would be entitled to a tax deduction for
their investment. This is
because it would be even more unlikely for the plaintiffs to have made the
investment if they were not
likely to be able to obtain their deduction.
<P>

95	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman put that the plaintiffs would not be entitled to
a deduction for the investment that ended up in the
film "Skar".  They say that
unless the plaintiffs became entitled to a tax deduction in the year of income
for which the relevant
funds were expended, the purpose for which the monies
were paid has failed.
<P>

96	As will be seen from what I have set out from the submissions, both parties
relied on the decision in <b>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Faywin
Investments Pty Limited </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/387.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 387</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2089%20ALR%20599" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 89 ALR 599 (Lockhart</a>, J) and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2093%20ALR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 93 ALR
241 (Full</a> Federal Court, Bowen CJ, French and Hill JJ).  This appears to be the
leading case on the subject of tax deductibility for investment
in films.
However, it only partly provides answers to the present problem.  For instance,
Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman submit that
the case establishes that it is
possible, if the taxpayer agrees to it, to contribute to the reimbursement of
production costs already
incurred.  That case is thus wholly different from the
present.  In any event, they say, the plaintiffs did not agree to contribute
money to the running costs of Fontana Films and to do so would not enable
either of them to obtain a tax deduction.  Further, in
the present case there
is no element of reimbursement of Fontana Films for monies it had spent on the
production of films.
<P>

97	Plaintiffs' counsel submit that under Division 10BA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936</a> the amount of money expended by a taxpayer by way of a
contribution to the cost of production of a film is allowed as a deduction
<u>for the year of income</u> in which the monies were expended by the
taxpayer:  see ss 124ZAFA(1)(a) and the concluding lines of s 124ZAFA(1).
Thus, for there
to be an effective available deduction for monies expended in
October 1996, all of the circumstances pre-requisite to obtaining that
deduction had to be satisfied in the financial year ended 30 June 1997.  Mr
Brereton SC agrees that the deduction, if it is able
to be claimed, must be for
the year of payment, ie that ending on 30 June 1997.
<P>

98	 The monies so expended by the taxpayer must have been expended "under a
contract" which must necessarily have been entered into
by the taxpayer no
later than the time at which the monies were expended (see ss 124ZAFA(1)(a)).

<P>

99	Again, the taxpayer must be in a position to satisfy the Commissioner that
she expected to become one of the first owners of
the copyright in <u>the
film</u> at the time when the moneys were expended (see s 124ZAFA(1)(c)).
Necessarily, the relevant expectation on the taxpayer's part must
exist at the
time the monies are paid by the taxpayer and the taxpayer must be in a position
to demonstrate that fact to the satisfaction
of the Commissioner. 
<P>

100	Thus, it is submitted it is plain from the foregoing that the monies must
be expended in connection with a specifically identified
film.  Moreover, the
taxpayer must show that when the monies were paid she intended to use her
interest in the copyright in <u>the film</u> for the purpose of producing
assessable income "from the exhibition of <u>the film</u> to the public" in
cinemas, on television (see s 124ZAFA(1)(c)(ii));   and note that the
declaration required by s 124ZAFA(1)(d)(iii)
is a declaration which must be in
force in respect of <u>the film</u>.
<P>

101	However, the submissions are that in the present case:
<P>

	(i)     the plaintiffs did not enter into any contract to expend capital
monies in producing an identified film unless that film
was "The Ugly Dumpling"
as represented;
<P>

	(ii)    the only expectation required by s 124ZAFA(1)(c)(i) which would have
been possible for Mrs Rogers to have formed at the
time when the monies were
expended was an expectation of acquiring an interest in the copyright of "The
Ugly Dumpling";  on her evidence
on no other possible basis could she assert
truthfully to the Commissioner that he should be satisfied that she had the
expectation
required by sub-section (1)(c)(i);
<P>

	(iii)	likewise, in connection with the requirements of sub-section (1)(c)(ii)
Mrs Rogers could not truthfully claim to the Commissioner
that she was
intending to use her interest in the copyright of any film other than "The Ugly
Dumpling" to produce assessable income.
<P>

102	As at the time the plaintiffs expended the relevant funds (16 October 1996)
and  at no time prior to the expiry of the financial
year in which those funds
were expended (30 June 1997) had the defendants taken all necessary steps to
enable the plaintiffs to claim
any deduction for that year.  The plaintiffs
cannot make any claim for a deduction for expenditure towards the production
costs of
"The Ugly Dumpling".  This is because no part of the funds were
contributed to either the past or prospective production costs of
the film. The
defendants do not assert otherwise. What the defendants do assert was that they
supplied to the plaintiffs a document
received on 28 April 1997 or a document
dated 28 July 1997 recording the receipt of different sums of money as
investments for "approved
films - namely `Skar'".  Each document refers to a
<u>provisional certificate</u>, a copy of which was said to be enclosed.
Plaintiffs' counsel point out that it is <u>not</u> the defendants' case that
any material contractual or other event occurred or was intended to occur after
the plaintiffs parted with
the $1m on 16 October 1996 to complete what was
necessary for the plaintiffs to obtain a deduction. Indeed, the defendants have
consistently
objected (successfully) to the reception of evidence from the
plaintiffs with respect to events after 1996 on the basis of relevance.
Further, it was never put to Mrs Rogers that she ever assented to the
defendants appropriating the monies which the third defendant
had received
towards making the film "Skar". In particular, by the time she was informed of
the alleged existence of a film of this
title and of the assertions by the
defendants that the plaintiffs' money was supposedly invested therein, she had
become wholly suspicious
of the defendants and had commenced investigations.
The document first recording any reference to an investment in "Skar",
although
dated 28 March 1997, was first sent on 28 April 1997 in response to
enquiries by Mr Hammil of Woinarski.
<P>

103	The plaintiffs say that they thus have had no tax deduction available to
them under Div 10BA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a>, nor did they claim any
for the 1996/1997 financial year, the only year in which such a deduction (if
otherwise available) could
have been claimed. In particular, it was not open to
the plaintiffs to claim any deduction for the alleged film "Skar" because
they:
<P>

	(i)	never agreed to invest $1m in a film called "Skar";
<P>

	(ii)	were never shown a prospectus apparently produced for this film;
<P>

	(iii)	never entered into any contract to expend capital monies in producing or
contributing to the cost of producing the "Skar"
film;
<P>

	(iv)	on the defendants' conduct could never have formed any expectation
required <u>at the time of expending the sum of $1m on 16 October 1996</u> of
becoming a part-owner of the copyright in "Skar"; and
<P>

	(v)	by no honest means could ever have attempted to satisfy the Commissioner
on the above question.
<P>

104	Furthermore, although not known to the plaintiffs, it is apparent that
there was not in force any declaration with respect to
the film "Skar" in
accordance with s 124ZADA(1). Such a declaration must be lodged by a person who
has been notified by the Commissioner
under s 124ZADA(2) that the person is
considered an appropriate person to lodge the declaration in respect of the
film.
<P>

105	The first defendant lodged a purported s 124ZADA declaration apparently
received by the Australian Taxation Office on 28 July
1997.
<P>

106	In that "declaration" the first defendant asserted merely a belief that the
Commissioner might consider him an appropriate person
to make the declaration
(par 1), and requested to be notified as to whether the Commissioner considered
him to be an appropriate
person to make such declaration (par 8).
<P>

107	It is thus clear that no declaration as required by s 124ZAFA(1)(d)(iii)
was <u>in force</u> in respect of the film "Skar". Clearly Mr Kabriel had not
yet been notified (if he ever was - as to which there is no evidence) that
the
Commissioner considered him to be an appropriate person.  (It is unlikely that
the Commissioner would have acted on the document
lodged, since it wholly fails
to comply with the requirements of s 124ZADA(e) relating to details of opening
a film account	).
<P>

108	Hence, in the year of income in which the monies were expended by the
plaintiffs, there was <u>not</u> in force the relevant declaration and for that
further reason no deduction was allowable.
<P>

109	Counsel for the plaintiffs further submit that  s 124ZAFA, which requires a
contribution to be made by the taxpayer to the cost
of producing a film, has
not been satisfied in the present case.  This is because:
<P>

	(i)	the plaintiffs did not contribute to the cost of producing a film but
contributed to the cost of the working expenses of the
third defendant; 
<P>

	(ii)	if the plaintiffs did provide money to the running costs of Fontana Films
and Fontana Films possessed other funds to finance
the production of a film, it
cannot be said that the plaintiffs have provided money or contributed capital
towards the production
of a film. There is simply no justification as a
question of fact for saying that the monies paid to the general account of a
company
will amount to a contribution to the cost of the production of a film
just because the company later makes a film or just because
the company is a
company in the business of making films;
<P>

	(iii)	further, the evidence does not satisfactorily disclose that the
contributions made by Mrs Rogers were spent on any films.
<P>

110	In any event, in strong contrast to the facts in the <b>Faywin Investments
case </b>(supra), there was no agreement between the plaintiffs and the third
defendant for the plaintiffs to contribute monies by way of reimbursement
of
the third defendant for monies it might have spent in the production of a film.

<P>

111	Counsel thus submit that it follows from the above that there was no
contribution by the plaintiffs toward the cost of the production
of a film.
That reason, and the reasons relating to the requirements of Division 10BA of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</a> show that the plaintiffs could not have a
deduction and that the payment on 16 October 1996 of $1m did not produce the
significant
tax advantage represented to Mrs Rogers on that day.
<P>

112	Mr Brereton SC says that this is a false analysis.  He puts that the
position is as follows:
<P>

	1.	The requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> s 124ZAFA(1) for a deduction
to be allowed in respect of monies expended under a contract entered into on or
after 25 May 1988 (see
sub-section (n)) are:-
<P>

	(i)	that a taxpayer has, under the contract, expended capital monies in
producing, or by way of contribution to the cost of producing,
a film (see
sub-section (a)); 
<P>

	(ii)	that at the time when the monies were expended, the taxpayer was a
resident and a provisional certificate or a final certificate
was in force in
relation to the film (see sub-section (b));
<P>

	(iii)	that the Commissioner is satisfied that, when the monies were expended,
the taxpayer expected to become the first owner or
one of the first owners of
the copyright in the film when that copyright came into existence, and intended
to use that copyright
or her interest in it for the purpose of producing
assessable income from the exhibition of the film to the public (see
sub-section
(c)); 
<P>

	(iv)	that, where the monies were expended by the taxpayer by way of
contribution to the cost of producing the film, there is in
force a declaration
lodged in respect of the film in accordance with sub-section 124ZADA(1) by a
person who has been notified by
the Commissioner under s 124ZADA(2) that the
person is considered by the Commissioner to be an appropriate person to lodge
the declaration
in respect of the film (see sub-section (d)(iii));  and 
<P>

	(v)	that before the end of the financial year in which capital monies were
first expended in producing or by way of contribution
to the cost of producing
the film, a production contract was entered into under which an amount of
capital money specified in the
production contract as the estimated cost of
producing the film was to be expended in producing or by way of contribution to
the
cost of producing the film, or a production contract and an underwriting
contract or contracts were entered into under which an amount
of capital money
specified in the production contract as the estimated cost of producing the
film was to be expended in producing
or by way of contribution to the cost of
producing the film (see sub-section (d)(iv)); 
<P>

	(vi)	notably, in contra-distinction to earlier periods (see sub-sections (f),
(h), (k)), there is no requirement that the monies
be "deposited in a film
account" in respect of the period under 25 May 1988 (see sub-section (n)). 
<P>

113	2.       There is no requirement that the contract referred to in
sub-section (a) be in writing. With this I agree.
<P>

114	3.      The circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs' investment of both
sums, as both parties should be taken as knowing that
Mrs Rogers' purpose was
to gain a tax deduction, gave rise to an implied contract by which she expended
the monies by way of contribution
to the cost of producing a film to be
produced by Fontana Films. 
<P>

115	4.	Sub-section (a) does not require that there be a particular identified
film at the time of the expenditure by the taxpayer,
and as films evolve in the
course of their production and frequently undergo name changes, this is not
surprising.  All that is required
is that there be in a practical and
commercial sense a link between the contributions of the investor and the
expenditure of film
production expenses. Expenditure obtains its character as a
contribution to the cost of producing a film from the purpose of the
taxpayer,
rather than from the manner in which the funds are expended (see the <b>Faywin
Investments case </b>(supra) per Lockhart J at first instance and Hill J in the
Full Court).  Although the cross examination of Mr Karl Kabriel showed
that
some of the total expenditure which he claimed for "Skar" was inaccurately
documented, a very large part of the expenditure
was uncontestable.   As Mr
Bedrich Kabriel explained, funds held in Czechoslovakia were used to pay the
production costs there, and
the funds received from  Mrs Rogers in Australia,
which were applied to Australian expenses of Fontana, freed up  those
Czechoslovakian
funds for that purpose. 
<P>

116	5.	In September and October 1996, Mrs Rogers was resident in Australia and
the second plaintiff was a New South Wales corporation;
 and a provisional
certificate was in force in relation to the film "Skar".  Thus, sub-section (b)
is satisfied.
<P>

117	6.	The Commissioner's satisfaction under sub-section (c)  is required at
the time when the deduction is to be allowed. Since
the plaintiffs have not at
this stage sought it, the Commissioner has not had to make a decision.
However, it is put, the circumstances
of a film investment for tax purposes
would inevitably give rise to the requisite intention on the part of the
taxpayer. The draft
prospectus for "Skar" is some evidence of this.  Mrs Rogers
or her company, at the time of the expenditure, intended to become a
copyright
owner of whatever film was produced using the monies contributed by her.   By
30 June 1997, she could truthfully claim
that when she expended the monies in
September and October 1996 she expected to become one of the first owners in
whatever film Fontana
Films produced using those monies, and as it transpired
that film was "Skar". 
<P>

118	The problem with this and the earlier submission 1(iii) is that they depend
on the assumption that there must be implied from
the mere fact of the making
of the investment in film that there was an intention in Mrs Rogers or the
second plaintiff to have an
expectation to become one of the first owners of
the copyright in some film or other.  I do not consider that this implication
should
be made. 
<P>

119	7.	There was in force a declaration lodged in respect of the film in
accordance with s 124ZADA(1).  Thus, sub-section (d)(iii)
is satisfied.  Even
if there were formal defects in the documentation that would not have prevented
its supplementation or correction
to enable a deduction to be allowed. 
<P>

120	8.	A production contract and underwriting contract was entered into.  Thus
sub-section (d)(iv) was satisfied. 
<P>

121	9.  	It thus follows that whatever the shortcomings in his evidence, Mr
Levy's opinion, given in his capacity as a tax law consultant,
to the effect
that so long as the Commissioner of Taxation was satisfied that the plaintiffs
expected to become one of the first
owners of the copyright and to use that
interest to produce assessable income, they would be entitled to an income tax
deduction
equal to 100% of the amounts invested - is correct. If a taxpayer
expends monies for the purpose of their being contribution to the
cost of
producing a film (but not any particular film), and expects to become an owner
of the copyright of whatever film is subsequently
produced, and there is in
force a provisional certificate in relation to that film when the monies are
expended, then the requirements
are satisfied. Accordingly, the submission that
the defendants had not taken all necessary steps to enable the plaintiffs to
claim
any deduction is not correct.  At the very least, even if this view is
wrong, it could not be said to be unreasonably held. 
<P>

122	The principal point made by Mr Brereton SC is that there is no requirement
in Division 10BA that the investment be in any particular
film.  He points to
the words "a film" in s 124ZAFA(1)(a).  However, when one reads  paragraphs
(a)-(d) of the sub-section as a logical
whole it is fairly clear that the
investment must be in a particular film in which copyright or a share of the
copyright is to pass
to the investor. It is virtually impossible to say that a
person who, say, invests money in films to be made by a big movie studio
has,
at the time of her investment, an expectation that she would be the owner of
the copyright when the film was made.
<P>

123	Mr Levy gave evidence which tended to support the third defendant.  Mr Levy
was a very believable witness in the box, but, on
analysis, Mr Coles QC's
criticisms of him are valid.  In any  event, he cannot be of assistance on the
construction of the statute.
Whilst I accept that films evolve in the course of
their production and frequently change their titles and sometimes change
direction,
I however do not accept that the deduction is available in cases
other than when the investment is in a particular film.
<P>

124	Despite the very technical submissions made on each side, in my view the
matter comes down to a couple of simple thoughts. 
First, it was necessary that
there be an expectation in Mrs Rogers or the other plaintiff that she would
have copyright in the film.
 There was not that expectation.  Secondly, the
expectation must be with respect to a particular film.  The "investment" in the
instant
case was in the context of "The Ugly Dumpling".  Some of the money
found its way, indirectly, into "Skar".  The requirements were
thus not
satisfied.
<P>

125	These findings are sufficient to show that the probabilities were that the
deduction was not likely to be available at the time
the investment was made.
I thus do not need to consider the remaining matters of detail raised by both
sets of counsel under this
head.  
<P>

126	<b>3C.     The claim against Mr Prasad regarding the Second Transaction
</b>
<P>

	I now need to deal with the case against Mr Prasad over the Second
Transaction.
<P>

127	The plaintiffs say that Mr Prasad, Fontana Films and Mr Kabriel made false
and misleading representations within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a>, or, alternatively, the representations were fraudulent.  In
paragraph 20 of the second further amended statement of claim, it is
pleaded
that the plaintiffs "should for tax reasons invest in a film to be made by
Fontana Films and that upon doing so considerable
tax advantages would be
available to them."  In paragraph 21, the pleading is that the film investment
would be in "The Ugly Dumpling
Film Fund".  
<P>

128	The plaintiffs say that these representations were made at the 16 October
1996 meeting at Mrs Rogers' Quay West apartment attended
by Mrs Rogers, Mr
Prasad and Mr Kabriel;  Mr Prasad and Mrs Rogers were at the meeting first.  Mr
Kabriel arrived later and only
stayed for a short time, the evidence being
anything from five to ten minutes (per Mr Kabriel) up to half an hour or 40
minutes 
(per Mr Kabriel's chauffeur, Mr Devos).  I prefer the latter, but
little turns on it.
<P>

129	Mrs Rogers' evidence was that before Mr Kabriel arrived, Mr Prasad told
her, "I am working on your financial affairs at the
moment.  One of the best
ways for you to minimise your tax is to invest in films".  After Mr Kabriel
arrived, Mr Prasad said to him,
"I think it is a good idea for Joan to invest
$1,000,000 in your film fund".   Mr Kabriel seemed surprised, but said, "If
it's good
for Joan then I agree".  Shortly afterwards, at the meeting, Mr
Prasad said, "You will be investing in a film called `The Ugly Dumpling'"
 and
handed her a copy of the prospectus.  Mrs Rogers did not read it, but handed to
Mr Prasad a cheque for $1m.  She did not receive
any documents or receipt
either then or for some time afterwards.
<P>

130	In cross examination Mrs Rogers was asked the following:
<P>

	Q.  "You knew Mr Prasad was assisting Mr Kabriel in some way?"
<P>

	A.    "Yes."
<P>

	Q.    "And you knew that by advancing the money to Fontana you were advancing
it to a company in which your friend Mr Kabriel was
interested and with which
Mr Prasad had some connection?"
<P>

	A.     "Yes."
<P>

131	Mr Kabriel said that when he entered the meeting, Mr Prasad was saying to
Mrs Rogers, "You can see how this will benefit you
tax wise, its up to Rick if
he is willing to help you" and Mr Kabriel then said, "Rick will do whatever he
can to help you."  Mr
Kabriel  said he had to go to another meeting, but that
Mr Prasad was to explain everything to Mrs Rogers very clearly.
<P>

132	Mr Devos gave evidence that upon his return to the car, Mr Kabriel said,
"Bloody Prasad, I told him not to involve Mrs Rogers
in the film fund raising.
That's all I need.  I don't want him to involve Mrs Rogers in Skar.  Andrew
should be giving her advice
on her business investments.  I don't want her
involved in my business."  I would accept this evidence:  it is inherently
credible.
<P>

133	Mr Prasad gave some brief evidence about the meeting and also about a
conference he had had with Mr Kabriel the day before as
to whether he would
accept further funds from the plaintiffs.  Mr Prasad says that he had handed
Mrs Rogers four copies of the prospectus
of "The Ugly Dumpling" some time
earlier so that she could give them to her friends.  There seems to be no
dispute between the parties
that "The Ugly Dumpling" film was already completed
and in any event no units were issued in or offered to Mrs Rogers in "The Ugly
Dumpling Film Fund".
<P>

134	Mr Brereton SC submitted  that although Mr Prasad had given  evidence that
he had discussed the proposed investment with Mr
Kabriel "probably a day before
the meeting with Mrs Rogers", this evidence was somewhat vague and was given
under cross examination
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  Although
the plaintiffs seize on DX14 as "proof on the defendants' own case that Mr
Kabriel had knowledge of the approach prior
to 13 September 1996", this is not
so:  it refers to the events of the meeting on 16 October 1996. 
<P>

135	The evidence as to the representation that any investment made would enable
the plaintiffs to obtain a tax deduction either
for 200% of the amount of the
investment, or at least 100% of the investment, does come from Mr Prasad's file
note DX14.  I cannot
say to what time that note refers.  On Mr Prasad's
evidence, the initial advice as to the virtue of film schemes as tax protection
was said about the time of the conversations with Gadens and that what happened
on 16 October, even though it involved a million
dollars, was merely a topping
up of the investment.
<P>

136	Mr Brereton SC says that Mrs Rogers' evidence does not establish any such
representation.  A fortiori it does not prove any
representation (which is not
pleaded) that the plaintiffs would obtain a deduction of 200% or 100% of the
value of the investment.
 At the very highest, it proves advice was given that
for tax reasons and to gain a deduction, the plaintiffs should invest in a
film
or films.
<P>

137	In my view the evidence goes further than Mr Brereton SC would concede.  I
agree that there was probably no mention of 200%
tax saving at the meeting, but
there was a clear statement that the investment in film would produce a
significant tax advantage.
 I also accept Mrs Rogers' evidence that the
investment was to be in "The Ugly Dumpling" and that she was handed a
prospectus for
that film at the meeting.
<P>

138	Mr Brereton SC further submits that:-
<P>

	1.	Insofar as any thing was said about a tax deductible investment, it was
advice, not a representation of fact.  Insofar as anything
was said about tax
benefits, it was an opinion and/or a projection, which is not false merely
because it turns out to be incorrect,
so long as there was a reasonable basis
for it when it was made;  see eg <b>James v Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1986/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] FCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2064%20ALR%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 64 ALR 347</a>, 372.
<P>

	2.	Such representation was not false in any material particular.  There was a
reasonable basis for it and so long as there was
a reasonable basis for the
opinion or projection, if on close judicial consideration it turns out to be
wrong that does not make
it misleading. Not only Mr Levy's opinion, but the
judgments of Lockhart J and Hill J in the <b>Faywin case</b> (supra) show that
different views may easily honestly and reasonably be held on this question.

<P>

	3.	Any such representation was not fraudulent.   Advice to invest in a film
for tax reasons could not be knowingly false, because
it is not a
representation of fact.  In any event, there was a reasonable basis for it.
<P>

139	After consideration, I consider that these submissions are correct.  Mr
Prasad does seem to have held the view that the investment
would be tax
effective for Mrs Rogers and, although I have held that it was not, he may well
have held that opinion.  In expressing
that opinion, he was thus not making any
false or fraudulent statement. 
<P>

140	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman put that the representation made by Mr Prasad in
respect of the investment being in "The Ugly Dumpling"
was clearly false.  On
the facts as I have found them, this is so. The representation was made with
the intention that Mrs Rogers
provide a cheque in the sum of $1m to Mr Prasad
who intended to deposit that cheque into the general account of Fontana.  Mrs
Rogers
acted on the representation and provided the cheque. The plaintiffs
cannot obtain a tax deduction for this amount and have suffered
loss and damage
in the sum of $1m and loss of the use of those funds.
<P>

141	The representation as to "The Ugly Dumpling" was false.  However, my real
concern is as to what flows from that fact.  Had the
representation been false,
but the money had been invested in "Skar" in a similar way, would not the
result have been that there
would have been no loss?   	
<P>

142	Mr Brereton SC puts that that the film in which the money was invested was
not "The Ugly Dumpling" was quite immaterial to the
purpose of all parties.  He
points to the evidence that Mrs Rogers did not even read the prospectus before
she handed over her cheque
for $1m.  Thus, he says, the $1m cheque was not
drawn, nor the consequent investment made, in reliance on any such
representation.
 Mrs Rogers' motive was to gain a tax benefit: the name or
script of the film and the contents of the prospectus were quite irrelevant
to
her decision to invest.
<P>

143	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman put that there can be no doubt as to the
materiality of "The Ugly Dumpling" film to the plaintiffs.
Although in her oral
evidence (T 44.30-44.47) Mrs Rogers said that the title and content of the film
had no interest for her at the
time of her handing over the cheque for $1m,
this did not obviate the materiality to her of the film "The Ugly Dumpling" and
the
provision to her of the prospectus.  It was never put to Mrs Rogers that at
the time she handed over the $1m, she agreed to do so
on terms that the
defendants could identify <u>any</u> film in connection with which she would
later be entitled to claim a tax deduction. Indeed, an analysis along these
lines would be
wholly opposed to Mrs Rogers' evidence at T43 where she made it
clear that she "wouldn't just do a million dollars without knowing
what was,
cause I got the Ugly Dumpling on the spot."        
<P>

144	Further, it was material to Mrs Rogers that there was an extant film
project and the handing over of the prospectus conveyed
to her that the
transaction into which she was putting the plaintiffs' money was a genuine one.
The front cover of the prospectus
plainly records "Prospectus - The Ugly
Dumpling Film Fund".  It is common ground that she retained possession of the
prospectus.
 Mrs Rogers took the prospectus to a later meeting at the third
defendant's premises at Turella.   Mrs Rogers also gave the following
evidence
at T67:
<P>

	Q.	"Would you have signed the cheque for $1m if there'd been 
<P>

	no prospectus given to you?"
<P>

A.	"No, and I - I was expecting the documentation, receipts
<P>

which I never received."
<P>

	...
<P>

	Q.	"Mr Brereton asked you, Mrs Rogers, and you agreed with
<P>

	him, that the contents of the prospectus were not relevant to
<P>

	you on 16 October 1996. Do you recall giving that
<P>

	evidence?"
<P>

	A.	"It wasn't relevant at the time because I trusted him."
<P>

	 Q.	"Was there, however, any significance at all attached by you
<P>

 to the fact that the prospectus existed and that Mr Prasad
<P>

 handed one over to you?"
<P>

	 A.	"Yes, because it meant that it was genuine."
<P>

	 Q.	"And by that what do you intend to convey?"
<P>

	 A.	"I meant that I thought they were honest and they had nothing
<P>

 to hide."
<P>

145	Even though Mrs Rogers did not read the prospectus, I do not accept that
the vehicle for the investment was of no interest to
her.  It is true that
there is insufficient evidence to find that the identity of the film was  the
causa causans for the investment,
it was a material matter for Mrs Rogers.
However, the key point is that for the reasons set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3B</a> above, the
investment for deductibility must be one where the intention is to obtain an
interest in copyright in a particular film.
 As Mrs Rogers was only
contemplating "The Ugly Dumpling", it was impossible for her to have any
intention to gain an interest in
the  copyright of any other film.  
<P>

146	The damage that flows is the loss of the tax deduction, probably less the
amount of the $1m that is recovered from Fontana Films.
<P>

147	The plaintiffs also put that Mr Prasad breached his fiduciary duties to
them which breach caused them loss.  They say Mr Prasad
breached his fiduciary
duties to the plaintiffs by advising and allowing them to invest the $1m in the
third defendant.  He stood
to benefit from the transaction by gaining
commission based upon the amount of money raised by him for the third
defendant. 
<P>

148	However, by parity of reasoning with the First Transaction, the only result
is that Mr Prasad must account for his commission
which is probably hardly
worth having.
<P>

149	<b>3D.    The principal claims over the Second Transaction against Fontana
Films</b> 
<P>

	I have already considered the factual situation under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3c" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3C</a> and will not
repeat what I there said.  It must be noted that there is no claim in
restitution for money had and received in this
part of the case. The key
questions in this part of the reasons are whether the representation about "The
Ugly Dumpling" can be sheeted
home to Fontana Films, and whether the principles
of <b>Barnes v Addy </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%209%20LRCh%20App%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 9 Ch App 244</a>, 251, apply.
<P>

150	Plaintiffs' counsel put that Mr Prasad was acting as Fontana Films' agent
for the purpose of raising funds for it within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s84.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 84(2)</a> of the
(Cth) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>.  The making of films by it and the general
conduct of its business, including the raising of funds for the making of
films, is in
the usual business of Fontana. The representations above were thus
made in trade or commerce: <b>Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 594.</a>  They submit that the conduct of the third defendant,
by its agent Prasad, falls squarely within the ambit of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade

that the case falls under s 995 of the Corporations Law, a matter I will
consider under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of these reasons.  
<P>

151	Mr Brereton SC submits that neither Fontana nor Kabriel is liable for the
alleged misrepresentations.  Further, Mr Brereton
SC submits that:
<P>

	1.	In advising the plaintiffs that they should invest in films, Mr Prasad was
neither acting on behalf of Mr Kabriel nor Fontana
Films, but on behalf of the
plaintiffs.  He submits that it is important to focus on the relevant conduct,
which in this case is
the advice given by Mr Prasad to the plaintiffs as to how
they should structure their affairs. In giving such advice, Mr Prasad did
so
not on behalf of Fontana Films, but in the course of advising the plaintiffs,
in his capacity as their professional adviser.
<P>

	2.	Kabriel and Fontana Films were not "knowingly concerned" in the making of
any such representation.  
<P>

152	As can be seen, one of the vital differences in approach by the counsel of
either side is whether what was said was said as
agent for Fontana Films or as
an adviser of the plaintiffs.  I have set out the contentions on this fairly
fully and do not need
to restate them. 
<P>

153	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s84.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 84(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> enlarges the concept of liability
for acts of agents as against the general law;  see <b>Walplan Pty Ltd v
Wallace </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1985/479.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] FCA 479</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%208%20FCR%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 8 FCR 27</a>, 38.  The key phrase in the sub-section is
"conduct...on behalf of".  In the <b>Walplan case </b>at page 37,<b>
</b>Lockhart J indicated that these words were wide ranging and covered
situations where a person did something in the course of his or
her employment
with a company or otherwise acted in the course of that company's affairs.  It
is not necessary to show that the act
was intended to benefit the alleged
principal, but when it does, it is easier to infer that the act was on behalf
of the principal:
 <b>Trade Practices Commission v Sun Alliance Australia Ltd
</b>(1993) 16 ATPR 41-286, 41,848.  
<P>

154	In the situation where a person is involved in a transaction in more than
one capacity, it is a matter of commercial reality
as to whether the relevant
statement was made on behalf of the defendant: <b>Lisciandro v Official Trustee
in Bankruptcy </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20139%20ALR%20689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 139 ALR 689</a>, 698.
<P>

155	Although the actions of Mr Prasad were in my view directed and even
primarily directed to Mrs Rogers' tax problems, he was also
acting in a way
that would benefit Fontana Films and to a smaller degree, himself.  He handed
out prospectuses in his role as an
agent of Fontana Films, he must have known
the need that Fontana Films had for funds.  However, I accept Mr Devos'
evidence that
Mr Kabriel was angry that Mr Prasad was steering Mrs Rogers into
investing in Fontana Films against Mr Kabriel's wishes.  I further
generally
accept Mr Kabriel's evidence that he was reluctant to have Mrs Rogers invest
monies with him.  Indeed, even on Mrs Rogers'
evidence, he was apparently
surprised when the question of the proposed investment was raised at all.  It
thus seems to me that as
a matter of commercial reality, if the representations
were made, they were made as part of the financial advice that Mr Prasad was
giving Mrs Rogers as her financial adviser.
<P>

156	I now turn to whether Fontana Films was "knowingly concerned" in the making
of the representation about "The Ugly Dumpling".
 Mr Brereton SC says that to
be "knowingly concerned" a party must know each fact which constitutes the
contravention, and take some
action to assist or facilitate its commission.  To
be "knowingly concerned" a party must know each fact which constitutes the
contravention,
and take some action to assist or facilitate its commission;
mere knowledge is not enough:  see <b>Yorke v Lucas </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20158%20CLR%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 158 CLR 661</a>,
670;  <b>R v Tannous </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 303</a>, 308.   He puts that neither Mr
Kabriel nor Fontana Films knew that the representation was being made, let
alone that it was false.
 The plaintiffs can really only submit that Mr Kabriel
"must have known" that the basis upon which a deduction could be properly
claimed had not been put in place, but, even if this were established,  that is
constructive notice and not the actual notice which
is required to establish
liability as an accessory of this type.  Mr Kabriel  and Fontana Films did
nothing to assist or facilitate
the relevant conduct and Mr Prasad's knowledge
cannot be attributed to Fontana Films because he was not relevantly acting on
behalf
of Fontana Films but as agent for Mrs Rogers, and because he was not
Fontana Films' directing mind.
<P>

157	Mr Brereton SC points out that the evidence shows that Mr Prasad was not at
the relevant time company secretary, though he did
become such from 19 May
1997.  Mr Prasad was never a director.  Thus, as Mr Prasad was not at the
relevant time an officer of the
company, his knowledge is not imputed to the
company.  Further, the plaintiffs get no comfort, as they submit they do from
<b> Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2)</b> [1980] 1 All ER
393, 404 where Buckley LJ speaks of the obligation of an officer of a company
to report certain matters to the company,
as that case deals with an officer
who was a director and secretary.  <b>El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings plc
</b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1993/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] EWCA Civ 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20All%20ER%20685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 All ER 685</a>, 703 shows that the company will only have imputed
knowledge of what is known by one of its officers if the company is under a
duty
to inquire of the officer as to the source of the funds, because, for
example, it is put "on inquiry".  That was not the case here.
 To receive
monies from fundraising for film making was nothing unusual and does not of
itself raise suspicion or inquiry.
<P>

158	Again, it could not be said that Mr Prasad was relevantly the controlling
mind of the company.  It is quite clear that whichever
version of the meeting
of 16 October 1996 one takes, it was Mr Kabriel that was the one who was in
charge of Fontana Films.
<P>

159	In my view these submissions are made out.  Thus, the Trade Practices and
fraudulent representation matters cannot be sheeted
home to Fontana Films.
<P>

160	The next matter is whether the plaintiffs paid over their $1m by
mistake.
<P>

161	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman say that the monies paid by the plaintiffs for
film investment were paid by way of mistake.  The
plaintiffs intended that the
monies be invested in  the film fund for "The Ugly Dumpling" when in fact the
monies were paid into
Fontana Films' general funds and no units could be issued
in "The Ugly Dumpling" at the time of the investment.   
<P>

162	On the other hand, Mr Brereton SC says the payment was not made as a result
of any operative mistake.  The plaintiffs knew that
they were investing in a
film to be made by Fontana Films.  There was no discussion as to which film.
That it could be any one of
several was plain from the proposal discussed by Mr
Prasad with Mrs Rogers and, particularly, the written proposals discussed by
him with Gadens on her behalf.  He puts that the plaintiffs have adduced no
evidence whatsoever of their state of mind when making
the investment.  Mrs
Rogers did not read the prospectus until much later. She gave no evidence of
what she believed was the subject
of her investment.   Accordingly, there is no
evidence of any mistake, as there is no evidence of her then state of mind. 
<P>

163	I have already canvassed a similar submission in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p2b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2B</a> of these reasons.
The real core of it is that an experienced businesswoman would blindly hand
over a cheque for $1m on the say so
of her financial adviser that it was a tax
effective investment when she had sought and obtained advice from Gadens and
had asked
and received a prospectus that was clearly marked "The Ugly Dumpling
Film Fund".   The submission does not impress me.
<P>

164	Mr Brereton SC's next submission is that the "mistake" did not "cause" the
disposition: <b>David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 353</a>, 376-8, 393-6.  Mr Brereton SC puts that in the present
case, any mistake was not causative, because it was immaterial to the
plaintiffs'
decision, as they were not concerned with the name or script of the
film, but only to gain a tax deduction.  He relies on Mrs Rogers'
evidence at
T44 which I have already analysed. 
<P>

165	The key sentence in the <b>David Securities case</b> for present purposes
is at p 378, viz, "If the payer has made the payment because of a mistake, his
or her intention to transfer
the money is vitiated and the recipient has been
enriched".   <b>Goff and Jones</b> translate this by saying, "The burden is on
the plaintiff to show from the facts that he would not have made the payment
but for
his mistaken assumption of fact...if the payer had known the true
facts, would he have paid the money?" (op cit 5th ed p 191) and
see <b>Barclays
Bank Ltd v WJ Simms Son &amp; Cooke (Southern) Ltd </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20QB%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] QB 677</a>, 695.
<P>

166	I do not consider that the plaintiffs have proved their case to this
extent.  Although Mrs Rogers gained comfort from the prospectus
and the film
fund and thought that the document showed that the investment was genuine,
there is no doubt that the primary factors
in the decision to "invest" were the
trust that Mrs Rogers had in Mr Prasad and the need for obtaining a tax
effective investment.
 Had no mistake about "The Ugly Dumpling Film Fund" been
made, it may well be that Mrs Rogers would still have made the investment.

<P>

167	Thus the plaintiffs' claim as to mistake fails.  This means that it is also
unnecessary to reconsider Mr Brereton SC's repeated
application to reopen to
shore up the defence that if Fontana Films received a payment under a mistake,
it would be inequitable for
it to have to repay the money as it had materially
changed its position on the faith of the receipt.	
<P>

168	The next claim is made on the ground of unconscionable conduct.  All Mr
Coles QC and Mr Coleman can say about this is that Mrs
Rogers was subject to a
significant level of vulnerability about which Messrs Prasad and Kabriel knew
and could exploit.  The case
is thus one of unconscionable exploitation of a
perceived disability and retention of a benefit accepted in those
circumstances.
 They referred to <b>Bridgewater v Leahy </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR
1525.</a>  
<P>

169	Mr Brereton SC says that the defendants did not engage in unconscionable
conduct.  He puts that unconscionable conduct is of
the type of conduct
described in <b>Blomley v Ryan </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 363</a> and <b>Commercial Bank of
Australia Ltd v Amadio </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 447</a> and<b> </b>involves a dealing in
which one party takes unconscionable advantage of a special disadvantage which
affects the other.  He puts that
in the present case there is no element of
special disadvantage, let alone unconscionable use of it by Mr Kabriel and
Fontana Films.
 There is nothing to suggest any overreaching or unconscionable
conduct here;  Mrs Rogers did not regard herself as being under any
duress. The
plaintiffs' submissions that Mrs Rogers was "subject to a significant level of
vulnerability" does not transcend to any
evidence to establish it and is quite
contrary to the evidence.  I agree with this submission.
<P>

170	The next head of claim is that there was a knowing receipt by Fontana Films
of the monies which flowed through to it because
of Mr Prasad's breach of
fiduciary duty.  
<P>

171	Plaintiffs' counsel submit that by the conduct (as detailed above) of Mr
Prasad, its financial controller, and Mr Kabriel, its
principal director and
shareholder, Fontana Films was sufficiently aware of the matters giving rise to
a breach of duty by Mr Prasad
so as to make it liable under the first limb of
<b>Barnes v Addy</b>,<b> </b>that is to say as the recipient of property
acquired in breach of fiduciary duty.  It held the $1m so received by it on
constructive
trust for the second plaintiff, and is liable to account for that
amount plus interest.  It is clear that within 4.5 months of receiving
the
funds on 17 October 1996 Fontana had spent the entire $1m, the relevant bank
statement, PX02.133 showing the bank account of
Fontana Films being reduced to
a balance of $17,280 by 6 March 1997.	
<P>

172	Mr Brereton SC, however, submits that Fontana Films did not receive the $1m
with knowledge of any breach of duty by Mr Prasad.
  Further, the evidence does
not establish dishonest participation by Fontana Films in any impropriety of
Mr Prasad.  To the contrary,
it had every reason to think that the investment
was the act of an independently advised businesswoman;  Mr Kabriel took steps,
once
he discovered that an investment was contemplated to see that she was
fully advised by her adviser, Mr Prasad.  There is nothing
to suggest that
Fontana Films knew of any impropriety by Mr Prasad.  Indeed, the transaction
was, in the circumstances, relevantly
in the interests of the plaintiffs, who
had a tax problem and needed a tax deduction; the transaction was calculated to
give them
that.  Mr Brereton SC further puts that the plaintiffs are unable to
point to any material matter which was not known to them, disclosure
of which
could have affected their decision to proceed with the transaction.  They fully
understood the purpose of the transaction,
the risks, and the connection of
Messrs Prasad and Kabriel with it. 
<P>

173	The plaintiffs' allegation is under the first limb of <b>Barnes v Addy</b>,
the "knowing receipt of trust property" rule.  That rule imposes liability only
in respect of trust property in the strict sense,
and not to gains or benefits
made in breach of fiduciary duty: <b>Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates
Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20132%20CLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 132 CLR 373</a>, 396;  <b>United States Surgical Corporation v
Hospital Products International Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20NSWLR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 NSWLR 157</a>, 253.  The $ 1m
was not trust property "in the strict sense", or at all.  Thus there is no
liability under the first limb of <b>Barnes v Addy</b>.	
<P>

174	Thus, Mr Brereton SC submits, any liability of Fontana Films would
therefore have to be under the second limb of <b>Barnes v Addy</b>, which is
not pleaded.  Even if it were, under that limb there has to be established
assistance with knowledge in the dishonest and
fraudulent design.  Even
assuming such design can be shown against Mr Prasad, dishonesty must also be
shown against Fontana Films.
 Negligence in failing to make inquiry is
insufficient: <b>Consul Development </b>at p 402.  The court looks to all the
circumstances known to the alleged participant, its experience and
intelligence, and its reason
for acting as it did:  <b>Royal Brunei Airlines
Sdn Bhd v Tan </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378</a>, 392.  In the present case, Fontana Films did
nothing to assist in any breach of fiduciary duty; it had no knowledge of the
circumstances
which led to the investment being made; and there was no reason
why it should.  Knowledge that Mrs Rogers was the source of the funds,
which is
all that the plaintiffs can establish, is insufficient because it falls far
short of proving knowledge of any dishonest
design.  
<P>

175	In my view these submissions ought to be accepted.
<P>

176	I should note that the principle considered in <b>Haywood v Roadknight
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1927/74.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1927] VicLawRp 74</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%20VLR%20512" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927] VLR 512</a> was again raised here.  As I noted in connection with the
First Transaction, the plaintiffs say that those in control of Fontana
Films
knew that the money had come from Mrs Rogers.  They knew that Mr Prasad, who
had obtained the "investment", was a fiduciary
qua Mrs Rogers.  That
transaction injected a large amount of cash into Fontana Films' bank account.

<P>

177	Mr Brereton SC submits that this argument is not open to the plaintiffs on
the pleadings.  I do not need to consider this as
in my view, the case is not
one where Fontana Films sought out the fiduciary to carry on its fund raising
in respect of the $1m.
 Rather, the position was the reverse, Mr Prasad sought
out a reluctant beneficiary.
<P>

178	Thus, were it not for the Corporations Law problem dealt with in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a>,
there would be no liability on Fontana Films in respect of the Second
Transaction on any of the causes of action pleaded.
<P>

179	<b>3E.  The claim over the Second Transaction against Mr Kabriel</b>
<P>

180	I now can consider the claims against Mr Kabriel personally.  These are:

<P>

	(i) 	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75</a> B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>; 
<P>

	(ii) 	Breach of fiduciary duty; and 
<P>

	(iii) 	Knowing receipt of trust monies.  
<P>

	I will deal with these in turn.
<P>

181	(i)  	Plaintiffs' counsel submit that Mr Kabriel was directly and
indirectly knowingly concerned in the contravention (see s
75B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>)  because he knew the monies
were obtained for a film investment which would generate a tax deduction and he
must be taken to have
known that the basis upon which such a deduction could be
properly claimed had not been put in place: <b> Yorke v Lucas</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20158%20CLR%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 158
CLR 661.</a>
<P>

182	Mr Brereton SC takes issue with this.  He says that even if I was of the
view that there was a false representation, there was
no evidence that Mr
Kabriel knew that it had been made, let alone that it was false.  Thus Mr
Kabriel cannot be liable under s 75B
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> as, to be
liable under that section, a party must know of each fact which constitutes the
contravention and take some action to assist
or facilitate its commission:
<b>Yorke v Lucas </b>(supra);<b> R v Tannous</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 308.</a>  I agree
with these submissions.
<P>

183	It is next put that Mr Kabriel himself breached fiduciary duties owed to
the plaintiffs.
<P>

184	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman say that Mr Kabriel was a director of the second
plaintiff having been appointed on 16 September
1996.  This is established by
the tender of the relevant extract from the records of the Australian
Securities Commission as under
s 1274B of the Corporations Law, such an extract
is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in it in the absence of evidence
to
the contrary.  Thus it is put that Mr Kabriel's objection that he was not at
the meeting at which he was purportedly appointed a
director of, inter alia,
the second plaintiff is irrelevant.  So too is the absence of any written
record of his consent.  He was
asked and agreed to be a director if he was
required (see T200.44).  The minutes of the directors' meeting of 17 April
1997,  PX02.51,
was not objected to by the defendants and shows Mr Kabriel
participating as a director of the second plaintiff.
<P>

185	However, it is submitted that on a broader basis, Mr Kabriel owed fiduciary
duties outside the traditionally recognised heads.
 He was an admitted
long-standing and trusted friend of Mrs Rogers.  He knew she trusted him to act
in her best interests:  he was
her confidante.  He had served on the Cenovis
Group Advisory Committee.  At the significant occasion where the $1m was
invested he
declared, "Rick will do whatever he can to help you".  It was to Mr
Kabriel that Mrs Rogers turned when she fell into dispute with
her daughter and
former accountants and solicitors.  She was in need of financial advice or
assistance.  It was on Mr Kabriel's recommendation
and introduction that Mr
Prasad was appointed as Mrs Rogers' accountant.
<P>

186	Counsel further put that it was readily apparent to Mr Kabriel that:
<P>

	(i) 	Mrs Rogers was, at the time she paid the $1m, vulnerable;
<P>

	(ii)	Mrs Rogers and the second plaintiff had come into millions of dollars
following the sale of the Cenovis Group of companies;
<P>

	(iii)	Mrs Rogers was susceptible to the position of dominance in her affairs
that, as at 16 October 1996, Mr Prasad had attained;
and
<P>

	(iv)	Mrs Rogers was reliant on expert assistance in connection with her
affairs.
<P>

187	In that scenario, it is put,  Mr Kabriel exploited his position both as a
director of the second plaintiff and as Mrs Rogers'
trusted adviser and
confidante (see generally <b>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical
Corp </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a>, 96-97 per Mason J;  <b>Glandon Pty Ltd v Strata
Consolidated  Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 543</a>, 546-547, 556-7).   Thus, by
allowing the second plaintiff to invest $1m of its money in Fontana Films, Mr
Kabriel was in breach
of his fiduciary duties described above in that:
<P>

	(i)	there was a clear case of a conflict of interest between Mr Kabriel's
duties to the second plaintiff and his duties to Fontana
Films of which he was
a director and shareholder;
<P>

	(ii)	Mr Kabriel knew or ought to have known that at the time of the investment
by the second plaintiff on 16 October 1996, all
things necessary to be done in
order to enable the second plaintiff to obtain a tax deduction had not been put
in place, thus exposing
the second plaintiff to a real risk of not being so
able to claim a tax deduction;
<P>

	(iii)	there was a personal benefit to be gained by Mr Kabriel should the
second plaintiff invest in Fontana Films in the sense
that Mr Kabriel would not
have to transfer and use the funds in his alleged account in Prague to pay
Fontana Films' running costs
and instead could supposedly use the Prague
account to pay for the production of any film.
<P>

188	Mr Brereton SC submitted that, on the contrary Mr Kabriel did not, in
breach of any fiduciary or director's duty owed by him,
permit the plaintiffs
to invest in Fontana Films.  He puts that Mr Kabriel did not owe duties to the
second plaintiff as a director.
 He was never a director of the second
plaintiff.  His status as a member of the Cenovis Advisory Group was undertaken
deliberately
in order to avoid his having to assume the responsibilities and
burdens of directorship.  His offer to act as such if required, acceptance
of
which was never communicated to him, does not make him a director.
Corporations Law s 1274B and PX02.208 do not assist the plaintiffs
because
there is evidence to the contrary.  His denial that he was appointed, his
absence from the relevant meeting and the absence
of a written consent are not,
as the plaintiffs submit, irrelevant; they are "evidence to the contrary" which
defeats the prima facie
presumption created by s 1274B.  
<P>

189	In my view the plaintiffs' submissions must be preferred.  The statutory
presumption reinforced by the minutes of April 1997,
lead me to find that Mr
Kabriel was a director of the second plaintiff in October 1996.  However, as Mr
Coles QC and Mr Coleman recognize
by the way their submissions were framed, it
is necessary to go further than this to succeed. 
<P>

190	On the broader issue, Mr Brereton SC submits that Mr Kabriel was not,
relevantly,  in a fiduciary relationship with, nor did
he owe fiduciary duties
to, the first plaintiff.   The relationship was personal, not fiduciary.
Although the plaintiffs submit to
the contrary, there is no evidence that Mrs
Rogers was vulnerable, susceptible to dominance, or reliant on others.  Mr
Kabriel did
not have the representative character of a fiduciary.
Alternatively, if there were in any respects a fiduciary relationship, the
transactions the subject of these proceedings were outside its scope;  Mr
Kabriel did not advise or otherwise participate in Mrs
Rogers' decision-making
in connection with either the $650,000 or the $1m investment.
<P>

191	Mr Brereton SC further submits that Mr Kabriel did not assist in or
facilitate the investments, and had no relevant involvement
in them at all.
Although the plaintiffs submit that he "exploited his position both as a
director of the second plaintiff and as
Mrs Rogers' trusted adviser and
confidante", they entirely fail to show how he did so:  there is no evidence
that he did anything
to procure her decision to invest.  The pleading against
him is only that he "allowed" or "permitted" her to invest;  it does not
allege
active involvement.  This serious allegation - that he "exploited" her - was
not put to him.	
<P>

192	Furthermore, Fontana Films was not insolvent as shown by the accounts,
annexure A to affidavit DA14.  However, even if it was
insolvent, that does not
involve any liability on Mr Kabriel's part as a fiduciary, because there was no
relevant gain or profit
made by Mr Kabriel as alleged fiduciary for which he
can be made to account:  <b>Chan v Zacharia </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 178</a>, 198-9.
<P>

193	The other basis on which it is said that Mr Kabriel is personally liable to
the plaintiffs is because of a knowing participation
in the breach of Mr
Prasad's fiduciary duty to Mrs Rogers and the second plaintiff;  see<b> Royal
Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [</b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995] 2 AC 378.</a> 
<P>

194	The plaintiffs further submit that the knowledge and conduct of Mr Kabriel
make it clear that:
<P>

	(i) 	he was active in procuring  the payment of  the $1m by the second
plaintiff; 
<P>

	(ii)	he was aware that the plaintiffs had been told that the "investment"
would be in "The Ugly Dumpling";
<P>

	(iii) 	he was aware that at the time the payment was made, the defendants had
not done and were not in a position to do all things
necessary to enable the
plaintiffs to obtain a tax deduction (being the accepted purpose of the payment
by the plaintiffs);  and
<P>

	(iv) 	he knew the plaintiffs' cheque would be deposited into Fontana's general
account for expenditure on its general purposes.
<P>

195	 From this, the submission goes, it can be readily inferred that he was
conscious of the impropriety involved in respect of
the obtaining of the $1m
payment from the plaintiffs.  He is thus liable for knowingly participating in
the breach of Mr Prasad's
fiduciary duty to Mrs Rogers and the second
plaintiff.
<P>

196	Mr Brereton SC submits that Mr Kabriel did not knowingly participate in the
receipt of the said sums, in such circumstances,
by Fontana Films.  He further
says that, even if Fontana Films had such knowledge, Mr Kabriel did not.  He
says that, contrary to
the plaintiffs' submissions, Mr Kabriel:
<P>

	(a)    was not involved in procuring the payment of the  $1m;
<P>

	(b)  	was not aware that the plaintiffs had been told that the investment
would be in "The Ugly Dumpling" if indeed they were so
informed;
<P>

	(c)	was not aware - and it was not put to him - that (if it were the case) not
everything necessary to allow a tax deduction had
been done;
<P>

	(d)	was not aware, in advance, that the cheque would be deposited into Fontana
Films' account for expenditure on its general purposes;
 but even if he was,
that does not advance the plaintiffs' case.
<P>

197	Mr Brereton SC also comments, properly in my view, that although the
plaintiffs suggest that knowledge on his part of Mr Prasad's
breach of
fiduciary duty can be inferred, why should so serious an inference be drawn in
the absence of any evidence of knowledge?
	
<P>

198	In my view the defendants' submissions should be preferred. The whole
flavour of the evidence is that Mr Prasad gave advice
to Mrs Rogers which she
accepted and that Mr Kabriel was a rather reluctant beneficiary. 
<P>

199	<b>4. 	The claim against Fontana Films under the Corporations Law</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>This claim refers to both the First and Second Transactions.
<P>

200	Mr Coles QC and Mr Coleman put that Mr Prasad, when discussing the issue of
the securities in the film investment and the use
of the expired "The Ugly
Dumpling" prospectus, engaged in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or
likely to mislead or deceive
Mrs Rogers.   The plaintiffs are entitled to a
refund of the monies paid is as a result of the defendants being in breach of

30E of the second further amended statement of claim.  They say that Mrs
Rogers' investment was for a "prescribed interest" as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> of the
Corporations Law in that it was a "participation interest" as defined in that
section.  They say that necessarily the making

deduction under Division 10BA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> involves the
acquisition by the investor of a proportionate share of the copyright in the
film to be made by others for the purpose
of exhibiting that film to gain or
produce assessable income.  All of the relevant features of a "participation
interest" are thus
attracted and the interest is accordingly a "security" in
accordance with the definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 92(1)</a> of the Law.
<P>

201	The defendants do not contest that investment of this kind involves the
issue of prescribed interests.  However, their counsel
submits that because the
investment exceeded $500,000 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/index.html#p7.11" class="autolink_findacts">Parts 7.11</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/index.html#p7.12" class="autolink_findacts">7.12</a> of the Corporations Law are
inapplicable because of s 66(3) of the Corporations Law.
<P>

202	The plaintiffs say that s 66(3) does not affect the position because
according to some of the defendants' documents, they were
to be issued with
1700 "units" of $1,000 each.  Mr Brereton SC says that this is irrelevant, one
looks to the total amount of the
investment, not the unit price.  The sum
involved exceeds $500,000, so that those provisions are inapplicable.
<P>

203	In my view, s 66(3) applies to invitations.  If there is no invitation to
accept less than $500,000 the invitation is exempt.
 If this is not the case,
the sub-section does not apply even though a particular person makes an
investment exceeding $500,000.
<P>

204	In view of the fact that the only real defence to this head of claim was an
appeal to s 66(3) of the Corporations Law which
I have rejected, the plaintiffs
are entitled to an order under s 1005 of the Corporations Law to recover the
loss and damages suffered
through the non-compliance with the Law.  This would
appear to be $1,650,000 plus interest.
<P>

205	<b>5.       The result of the case</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>It must follow from what I have said that the plaintiffs are entitled
to succeed against Fontana Films in respect of both transactions.
 There thus
must be a verdict for the relevant plaintiff for $1,650,000 plus the relevant
amount of interest.
<P>

206	It also follows that, as against Mr Prasad, the proper order is that it be
referred to a Master to assess the proper amount
of damages that he must
pay.
<P>

207	It also follows that there should be a verdict for Mr Kabriel.
<P>

208	As to costs,  I would have thought that it follows that Mr Kabriel should
have his costs and that Fontana Films must pay the
plaintiffs' costs, but as
the same counsel appeared for both those defendants, some more mature
consideration may have to be given
to this question.  Again, the fact that the
plaintiffs only succeeded against Fontana Films over the Second Transaction on
one of
a number of attacks, might be significant on the question of costs.
<P>

209	It is thus appropriate that I now merely publish these reasons and then
stand the matter over for the plaintiffs to bring in
short minutes of order.  I
will tentatively fix Thursday, 6 May 1999 at 9:30 am  for this purpose, but
this date may be changed by
arrangement with my Associate.
