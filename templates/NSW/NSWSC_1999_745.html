<b><u>70002/97  -  REGINA  v  MICHAEL PATSALIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70200/97  -  REGINA  v  ALEXIOS SPATHIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (On application to lead evidence relating to custody of Mr
Spathis (refer page 600 of transcript))  [No 5]</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   Mr Campbell, on behalf of Mr Spathis, has
sought to lead from Detective Jacob evidence concerning instructions given by
Detective
Jacob to the Station Sergeant in relation to the custody of Mr
Spathis.  These instructions were given at the conclusion of the record
of
interview. They were given after Mr Spathis had repeatedly said to Detective
Jacob that he was in fear of Mr Patsalis at the time
he performed various acts,
and performed those acts by reason of that fear.  Detective Jacob apparently
gave instructions that Mr
Spathis was to be placed in protective custody so
that there would be separation between Mr Spathis and Mr Patsalis.
<P>

2  	Counsel for Mr Patsalis objects to this evidence.  He objects to
the revelation of the fact that his client, and indeed Mr Spathis,
were placed
in custody, although the Crown points out, and I think it is the fact, that the
jury may well conclude that was a necessary
consequence of their arrest.
<P>

3  	However, it seems to me that the opinion of this officer, having
heard Mr Spathis' version, does not go to any real issue. 
If it does have
relevance, in my judgment, it is so slight as to be substantially outweighed by
the danger that the evidence might
be unfairly prejudicial to a party, namely,
the general revelations of what happened immediately after.
<P>

4  	For that reason I reject the evidence.
<P>
