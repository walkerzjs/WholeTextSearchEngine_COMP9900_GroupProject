<b><u>070009/98 - REGINA v Tracey Louise PHILLIPS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:    On 23 March 1998 the accused, Tracey
Louise Phillips, was arraigned before Justice Barr on an indictment charging
her with the
murder of her infant child, Benjamin Skillin, on 27 August 1996 at
Parkes.  She entered a plea of not guilty and the matter was stood
over for
trial on 22 November 1999.  
<P>

2   	At the commencement of proceedings on 22 November 1999 I
was informed that the Crown proposed leading evidence concerning the
deaths of
two other children of the accused, Natalie and Nathan.  The Crown was also
seeking to lead evidence as to a number of "acute
life threatening events" to
which various of the children of the accused had been subject.  It was
submitted that this body of evidence
was admissible pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s98.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 98</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">97</a> of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </b>1995 ("the Act").  
<P>

3   	The whole of this evidence was the subject of objection by
Ms Lyons who appeared on behalf of the accused.
<P>

4   	It was apparent that this issue should be determined as a
preliminary matter since it was central to the Crown's case.  It
was proposed
that a number of expert witnesses be called and I was advised that the <i>voir
dire</i> hearing might take in excess of one week.  In these circumstances it
was agreed that the appropriate course was to embark on the
determination of
this preliminary issue prior to empanelling a jury.  
<P>

5   	The accused put Benjamin Skillin to bed at about 5.30pm on
27 August 1996.  He was aged 8 months.  The accused was later to
tell police
that she had checked Benjamin at about 6.30pm and he appeared normal.  Shortly
before 8pm she again checked him.  On
this occasion she observed that he was
lying on his stomach and making a bubbly noise.  His face was white and his
lips were blue.
 The accused picked him up and observed that he was
unresponsive.  She ran to the front door of her home where she saw her husband,
Ken Skillin, alighting from a taxi.  She said to her husband, "I've got to get
Benjamin to the hospital `cause he doesn't look like
he's breathing".  The baby
was conveyed to the Parkes Hospital by taxi. The child failed to respond to
attempts to resuscitate him
carried out by staff in the Hospital's Casualty
Section and he was declared dead at 8.39pm.  
<P>

6   	A post mortem was conducted by Dr Bradhurst of the New
South Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine.  He observed that the body
was that
of a well nourished and well developed infant of about the stated age.  There
was no evidence of any external or internal
injury nor any evidence of
congenital abnormality.  There was no evidence of any significant disease.
There was no old or recent
bone injury.  No relevant microbiological or
biochemical findings were made.  No drugs or poisons were found in the body
save for
a small quantity of paracetamol which is not relevant.  Investigations
for inherited metabolic disorders proved negative.  The post
mortem examination
did not reveal any disease process which could have caused the death of the
child.  
<P>

7   	In his post mortem report dated 17 January 1997 Dr
Bradhurst stated:
<P>

"I have not been able to determine the cause of death because, as referred to
in Professor Byard's report, such autopsy findings
in this age group may be
seen in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, in both accidental and induced asphyxia,
in inherited metabolic disorders
and, sometimes, in fulminant sepsis".  
<P>

8   	Dr Bradhurst went on to observe that inherited metabolic
disorders and fulminant sepsis had been excluded.  This left the cause
of death
as either Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or induced asphyxia.  The post mortem
findings were consistent with, but did not
confirm or exclude, either
condition.  
<P>

9   	When Benjamin was aged 2&#189; months he was admitted to
the Calvary Hospital, Canberra, having suffered an acute life threatening
episode ("ALTE").  
<P>

10   	Benjamin was the fifth child born to the accused and her
de facto partner, Kenneth Skillin.  The eldest child, Robert, was
born on 30
October 1989.  He has had no significant medical history.  
<P>

11   	On 1 June 1991 Nathan was born.  On 11 December 1993
Nathan died aged 2&#189; years.  Dr Jain, who conducted the autopsy,
concluded
that Nathan died of aspiration pneumonia.  
<P>

12   	On 29 October 1992 Natalie was born.  During her short
life she was admitted to hospital on five occasions with what the Crown
submits
were ALTEs.  On 4 August 1993 Natalie died.  The cause of death was reported to
be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  
<P>

13   	On 28 July 1994 Jack was born.  On 16 July 1995 Jack was
admitted to the Woden Valley Hospital with what the Crown submits
was an ALTE.

<P>

14   	The Crown seeks to lead the following evidence:
<P>

&#183;	the fact and circumstances surrounding the death of Nathan
<P>

&#183;	the fact and circumstances surrounding the death of Natalie
<P>

&#183;	22/4/93 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Natalie to
Calvary Hospital
<P>

&#183;	3/5/93 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Natalie to
Calvary Hospital
<P>

&#183;	7/5/93 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Natalie to Woden
Valley Hospital
<P>

&#183;	28/5/93 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Natalie to
Calvary Hospital
<P>

&#183;	24/7/93 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Natalie to
Woden Valley Hospital
<P>

&#183;	16/7/95 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Jack to Woden
Valley Hospital
<P>

&#183;	24/3/96 - the circumstances surrounding the admission of Benjamin to
Calvary Hospital
<P>

15   	The Crown presses the admission of this body of evidence
as "related events" which prove, because of the improbability of
them having
occurred coincidentally, that the death of Benjamin was caused by induced
asphyxia; s 98 of the Act.  Alternatively,
the Crown submits that the evidence
is admissible as evidence of "tendency" pursuant to s 97 of the Act.  The
tendency identified
by the Crown in this respect is "for the accused to conduct
herself in a way detrimental to the well-being of her children and to
cause
breathing difficulties and attendance at hospital".  Finally, the Crown
submitted the evidence (or some portion of it) was
admissible as "relationship
evidence". 
<P>

16   	Evidence may only be admitted pursuant to ss 97 and 98 of
the Act if, <i>inter alia</i>, the party adducing the evidence has given
reasonable notice in writing in accordance with the regulations of its
intention to adduce
the evidence.  I was informed that a form of notice dated 7
April 1999 enclosing the Crown case statement which forms part of Ex
VDA had
been served on the solicitors acting for the accused.  No objection was taken
concerning the manner or form of the notice.
 To the extent that the notice
fails to comply with the requirements of the regulations, I dispensed with the
requirement for the
same pursuant to s 100 of the Act.  
<P>

17   	At a criminal trial tendency evidence or coincidence
evidence may only be admitted against the accused if it meets the requirements
of s 101(2) of the Act, namely, that the probative value of the evidence
substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that it may
have on the jury.

<P>

18   	"Probative value" means the extent to which the evidence
could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the
existence of a
fact in issue (Dictionary to the Act).  The fact in issue is said to be the
cause of death of the infant Benjamin.
<P>

19   	The prejudice with which s 101(2) is concerned is the risk
that the jury will use the evidence on a basis logically unconnected
with the
issues in the case:  <b>R v Lockyer</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2089%20A%20Crim%20R%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 89 A Crim R 457</a> at 460;  <b>R v
Colby</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSW%20CCA%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSW CCA 261.</a>  If there exists a rational explanation for the
evidence other than the inculpation of the accused with the offence charged the
test
in s 101(2) will not be met.  The evidence in such a case would lack the
necessary probative value:  <b>Pfennig v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 461</a>;
<b>R v Lock</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2091%20A%20Crim%20R%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 91 A Crim R 356</a> at 363;  <b>R v AH</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2098%20A%20Crim%20R%2071" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 98 A Crim
R 71</a> at 78.  
<P>

20   	The Crown's primary position was that the deaths of
Natalie and Nathan and the ALTEs were "related events" for the purposes
of s 98
of the Act. Two or more events are "related events" if, and only if, they are
substantially and relevantly similar and the
circumstances in which they
occurred are substantially similar; s 98(2). 
<P>

21   	The Crown points to the following as demonstrating
substantial and relevant similarity for the purpose of the section:
<P>

(i)	each event occurred with respect to a natural child of the accused;
<P>

(ii)	in each case the accused located the child at a time when the child was
not breathing or was experiencing breathing difficulties;
<P>

(iii)	the accused arranged in each case to take the child to hospital;
<P>

(iv)	the accused's de facto husband was "unavailable" in the context of a
background of domestic friction.
<P>

22   	Ms Lyons did not concede that (ii) and (iv) were
established by the evidence.  
<P>

23   	The Crown tendered a bundle of documents including expert
reports, statements made to the police by the accused and by Kenneth
Skillin,
statements made by neighbours, copies of the hospital notes relating to the
various admissions of Natalie, Nathan, Jack
and Benjamin, and transcript of
evidence given in care proceedings.
<P>

24   	Oral evidence was led from the following expert
witnesses:
<P>

(i)	Dr Bradhurst, the forensic pathologist who carried out the post mortem
examination of Benjamin;
<P>

(ii)	Professor Byard, specialist forensic pathologist attached to the Forensic
Science Centre, Adelaide and Associate Professor
in the Department of
Paediatrics and Pathology at the University of Adelaide.  Professor Byard has
made a specialist study of SIDS.

<P>

(iii)	Dr Suzette Booth, paediatrician.  Dr Booth has a great deal of experience
in the field of child abuse.  For a number of years
she was the head of the
Child Protection Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children.  Dr Booth
was consulted when Jack was
admitted to that hospital at the age of 11 months
because of concerns arising out of a life threatening episode.  She was also
involved
in the care of Benjamin when he was admitted to the New Children's
Hospital aged about 6 months.
<P>

(iv)	Dr Kerrigan, paediatrician practising in Orange.  Dr Kerrigan treated
Natalie for a urinary tract infection.
<P>

(v)	Professor Isaacs, a Clinical Professor attached to Sydney University. His
speciality is paediatrics. He is Staff Physician in
the Department of
Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Children's Hospital, Westmead.  
<P>

(vi)	Dr Seton, paediatrician, working at the Children's Hospital, Westmead
Sleep Disorders and Sudden Infant Death Research Unit.
<P>

(vii)	Dr Kieran Moran, Senior Staff Specialist Paediatrician at the Sydney
Children's Hospital.  Dr Moran also has very considerable
experience in the
field of child abuse.  He is the Medical Director of the Sydney Children's
Hospital Child Protection Team.
<P>

(viii)	Dr Collins, consultant forensic pathologist.
<P>

25   	It is appropriate at this point to briefly outline the
evidence concerning each of the hospital admissions upon which the
Crown
relies.
<P>

<b>Natalie</b>
<P>

<b>Admission to Calvary Hospital - 22 April 1993</b>
<P>

26   	Natalie was brought to the hospital by her mother.  The
history recorded in the hospital notes is that Natalie had a bottle
and was
then observed to be gasping for breath for ten minutes.  She went very pale.
She was described as having had a rattly chest
for two days.  On presentation
at the hospital she appeared quite well and the accused was advised to return
in the event of any
recurrence.  
<P>

<b>Admission to Calvary Hospital - 3 May 1993</b>
<P>

27   	The hospital notes record that Natalie presented as a 6
month old baby with a second episode - twenty minutes of crying due
to pain,
then had trouble breathing - sounded "blocked" then went limp and pale and
floppy.  She was not cyanosed. The incident occurred
one hour after a bottle.
She was sitting in her bouncer at the time.  An examination of the child showed
that she was pale but alert.
 The notes suggest consideration was given to this
episode being gastro oesophageal reflux or a breath holding attack.  
<P>

<b>Admission to Woden Valley Hospital - 7 May 1993</b>
<P>

28   	Natalie was admitted on 7 May 1993 and discharged on 9 May
1993.  The reason for admission was given as croup/apnoea/social
admission.
The emergency department notes record a history of five days of stridor.  On
examination the child was described as having
obvious stridor.  Otherwise she
was reported to be looking very well.  A provisional diagnosis of viral croup
appears to have been
made.  
<P>

<b>Admission to Woden Valley Hospital - 24 July 1993</b>
<P>

29   	Natalie was brought to hospital by ambulance. She was
admitted at 8.39pm following what was described as a funny turn at home
that
evening.  The history supplied was that Natalie went pale, listless and
lethargic.  Her fingers went blue and her face white.
 Her breathing was
shallow, slow, quiet.  Her eyes rolled back.  On examination it was noted that
she had a discharge from her left
ear.  Her throat was red and her tonsils
enlarged and there was a query as to flecks of pus.  The provisional diagnosis
made by medical
staff on this occasion appears to be that she had an atypical
seizure.
<P>

<b>Jack</b>
<P>

<b>Admission to Woden Valley Hospital - 18 July 1995</b>
<P>

30   	The emergency department records record that the accused
telephoned reporting that Jack was not rousable and that his pupils
were
dilated.  She was advised to call an ambulance.  The nursing admission sheet
records the accused as advising that she had been
unable to wake the baby up.
He was described as having been not rousable for twenty minutes.  He had
recovered by the time the ambulance
arrived.  The medical notes suggest
provisional diagnoses of apparent life threatening event / "more likely
seizure" were considered
by those treating Jack at the time.  It was also noted
that Jack had a history of asthma.  He was referred to Dr Seton of the Sleep
Disorder Unit at the Royal Hospital for Children.
<P>

31   	It is to be noted that the sleep study undertaken on Jack
was normal.  
<P>

<b>Benjamin</b>
<P>

<b>Admission to Calvary Hospital - 24 February 1996</b>
<P>

32   	The hospital notes record:
<P>

"Baby brought in by mother and neighbour, baby is two months old.  On
appearance, pale, lethargic, no response to external stimulus,
lips dry and
query cyanosed or blue, intercostal indrawing, shallow breathing" (T22/23).
<P>

33   	Benjamin was transferred from the Calvary Hospital to
Woden Valley Hospital.  The Woden Valley Hospital notes for 25 February
1996
record the history given by the accused:
<P>

"Heard babe cry out, laboured breathing, pale and limp, query arm tremors,
picked up child.  Breathing less laboured, taken to Calvary".
<P>

34   	None of the medical staff who attended Natalie, Jack or
Benjamin gave evidence concerning any of the admissions.  The medical
notes in
relation to each admission were in evidence on this application.  A number of
expert witnesses were invited to comment on
the significance of entries
contained in the hospital notes.  
<P>

35   	The Crown sought to characterise each of the subject
admissions as ALTEs.  I should note that while some witnesses described
ALTEs
as "acute life threatening events" Dr Moran explained they are "apparent life
threatening events".  It is not clear that a
great deal turns on this. Jack's
admission on 18 July 1995 is described in the hospital notes as being possibly
an apparent life
threatening event. 
<P>

36   	The criteria for ALTEs includes that the child appears
lifeless, pale, blue and not breathing for twenty seconds or more.
 The child's
heart rate has to be slow (Professor Byard - T31).  
<P>

37   	Turning, firstly, to Natalie's admissions, Professor Byard
observed that there was a deal of contradiction in the evidence.
 I took him to
be saying in this regard that he did not accept that the evidence pointed to
each of her admissions being ALTEs. 
As to her admission on 22 April 1993,
Professor Byard considered this was consistent with an episode of difficult
breathing associated
with reflux while she was feeding.  He did not consider
the medical records concerning this admission to fulfil the criteria for
an
ALTE.  Dr Kerrigan, a Paediatrician who had treated Natalie in relation to a
urinary tract infection of some severity, did not
demur to the suggestion that
the notes were consistent with Natalie suffering from a reflux problem.  Dr
Moran was of a like view.
 Again, Professor Byard considered the provisional
diagnosis made by staff at Calvary Hospital in relation to the 3 May 1993
admission,
namely, that it had been a gastro oesophageal reflux or possibly a
breath holding attack, to be an explanation for the incident (T37).
 Dr
Kerrigan did not demur to this suggestion.  Dr Moran agreed.  
<P>

38   	As to Natalie's admission on 7 May 1993 Professor Byard
observed that the medical notes included reference to the child having
what
looked like a viral infection.  She had large lymph glands in her neck.  She
was thought to be suffering from viral croup. 
This is a viral infection of the
upper airway and causes babies difficulties in inhaling.  That leads to the
noticeable "croupy"
noise in breathing.  This was consistent with the history
of five days of stridor.  Stridor is the sound made when a baby inhales.
 I do
not understand the evidence concerning this admission to involve an incident of
breathing difficulty relevantly similar to
a number of the admissions on which
the Crown relies.  The evidence supporting the view that Natalie on this
occasion was suffering
from viral croup was persuasive.  
<P>

39   	A deal of attention was devoted to Natalie's admission to
the Woden Valley Hospital on the evening of 24 July.  This was the
occasion
when treating medical staff considered that Natalie may have suffered an
atypical seizure possibly as secondary to urinary
tract infection (T19/20).
She also had tonsillitis.  Dr Bradhurst noted that the signs of peripheral
cyanosis may be explained by
tonsillitis since a fever can produce this
condition due to constriction of the blood vessels (T21). 
<P>

40   	Professor Byard considered that Natalie may have suffered
a convulsion consistent with a reaction to an infection. He noted
that she had
a discharge from her left ear which was suggestive of bilateral middle ear
infection (T38).  Febrile convulsions are
common in children aged between six
months and six years.  They are brought on by a high temperature.  One in
twenty children will
suffer a febrile convulsion (T72).  In a child under
twelve months a febrile convulsion may involve the child becoming atonic
(limp),
floppy and rolling their eyes.  There was an issue as to whether
Natalie's presentation was consistent with febrile convulsion since
her
temperature recorded on admission was 36.5 degrees.  It was common ground among
all the expert witnesses that this temperature
was within the normal range and
was not indicative of a febrile convulsion.  However, there was evidence that
childrens' temperatures
go up and down quite rapidly when young (T74). The day
following her admission Natalie's temperature peaked on two occasions.  This
was consistent, according to Dr Bradhurst, with her having "some underlying
febrile process" (T80).  In this regard Dr Bradhurst
considered that the
tonsillitis could have been significant. 
<P>

41   	Both Dr Kerrigan and Professor Isaacs appeared to place
some significance on the results of an EEG conducted on Natalie on
the occasion
of her admission on 24 July 1993.  Dr Kerrigan relied on a letter received from
Dr Hufton which was understood to paraphrase
the contents of the EEG report.
Dr Hufton's letter asserted that the EEG had revealed excessive slow wave
activity.  This would be
a significant finding since it would suggest a brain
insult of considerable proportions.  Only a prolonged seizure would produce
such a pattern.  Asphyxia would also produce such a result.  In the course of
the evidence of Dr Moran the original EEG report was
tendered. The EEG report
for Natalie was normal. Inexplicably, it appears that Dr Hufton had been either
supplied with incorrect
information or there had been some misunderstanding
when he received a briefing on the results of the EEG.   
<P>

42   	In relation to Natalie's medical history there was
evidence to suggest that she suffered from gastro oesophageal reflux. 
This can
produce symptoms consistent with her admissions on 22 April and 3 May 1993.  It
is also clear that Natalie had suffered
a severe urinary tract infection.  This
was the difficulty for which Dr Kerrigan had treated her.  
<P>

43   	The picture which emerged with respect to Natalie's
admissions seemed to me to be a complex one.  To simply describe each
admission
as the child being brought into hospital with breathing difficulties is to
introduce an element of artificiality. The way
the Crown approached the matter
was to contend that, though each individual admission could be explained on
medical grounds other
than an ALTE, when viewed as a whole (and in conjunction
with the incidents involving Jack and Benjamin) the evidence pointed
irresistibly
to the view that these medical emergencies were being created by
the deliberate act of the accused.
<P>

44   	The admissions of both Jack and Benjamin with ALTEs appear
to fit the pattern advanced by the Crown a little more comfortably.
 Even here
there were medical explanations other than the one advanced by the Crown.
Thus, the principal diagnosis in relation to
Jack's admission on 16 July was
that he had a seizure with a possible apnoea episode together with a diagnosis
of asthma.  
<P>

45   	In the case of Benjamin's admission on 24 February 1996
Professor Byard considered that the sequence of events reported was
not
diagnostic of an ALTE.  In this regard he considered it significant that
Benjamin's pallor, unresponsiveness and limpness followed
an episode of gagging
and vomiting.  That history, if accurately reported, suggested more an episode
of reflux (T41).  
<P>

46   	Benjamin was investigated for reflux during his stay in
the Woden Valley Hospital. Those investigations showed that he suffered
several
episodes of gastro oesophageal reflux.  Dr Booth said that the history was not
suggestive of reflux as an explanation for
the admission on this occasion.
Benjamin had a milk scan which is a way of testing for reflux.  The scan showed
several episodes
of gastro oesophageal reflux none of which reached the point
of going into the lungs.  She noted that reflux is a very common disorder
in
babies and it does not cause acute life threatening events such as the one
experienced by Benjamin (T59).  Dr Moran took strong
issue with Dr Booth as to
this aspect of her evidence.  Dr Moran said that gastro oesophageal reflux and
the mechanism whereby it
causes an ALTE in babies is by means of stimulation of
laryngeal chemoreceptors and that can occur with regurgitant or non-regurgitant
gastro oesophageal reflux. He went on to explain that one may never see
vomiting in a baby with gastro oesophageal reflux.  Such
a baby may suffer life
threatening events as a result of the reflux.  That is because small amounts of
acid stimulate the chemoreceptors
in the larynx causing apnoea and
brachycardia.  In summary, Dr Moran considered Dr Booth's observations
concerning the results of
the tests of no relevance in determining whether
Benjamin's admission on 24 February 1996 was in consequence of an episode of
reflux
(T118).
<P>

47   	The Crown placed some emphasis on the evidence of the
sleep study results for Jack and Benjamin.  Taken in conjunction with
other
evidence it was submitted that these results pointed strongly against a
diagnosis of SIDS in relation to the death of Benjamin.
<P>

48   	Sleep studies were carried out on both Jack and Benjamin.
These were conducted at the Sleep Disorder Unit, Children's Hospital,
Westmead.
The studies showed both babies to have normal sleep patterns.  The significance
of this finding with respect to the exclusion
of a diagnosis of SIDS as a cause
of death for Benjamin was a matter of some controversy.  
<P>

49   	Dr Seton, who specialises in infant sleep disorders and is
attached to the Children's Hospital Sleep Disorders and Sudden
Infant Death
Research Unit, considered the sleep study results of significance tending
against SIDS as the cause of the death of
Benjamin.  Dr Seton accepts that the
causes of SIDS are unknown and that there are a number of different mechanisms
advanced to explain
the phenomenon.  I understood Dr Seton to be strongly of
the view that sleep apnoea is a strong predictor of SIDS.  For this reason
his
unit carries out sleep studies designed to detect apnoea in infants.  Babies
who present with apnoea are at risk and their parents
counselled accordingly.
There are various preventative strategies which may be brought into play to
reduce the risk of death.  Dr
Seton considers that the reduction in numbers of
children dying from SIDS is in part a reflection of the success of the work
undertaken
by his clinic and others like it.  This is in the context of a
public education campaign which has encouraged parents to lie babies
on their
back, ensure the baby is not overheated, and avoid smoking in the presence of
the baby.  
<P>

50   	Dr Seton said that there are reported cases of families
losing more than one child as the result of SIDS. His clinic has dealt
with
such cases.  In Dr Seton's experience families who suffer from multiple SIDS
deaths have a history of apnoea.  It is to be expected
that one or both of the
parents will suffer from apnoea and that the baby, if tested, would not exhibit
a normal sleep pattern. 

<P>

51   	Professor Byard includes amongst his impressive
qualifications a degree as Doctor of Medicine conferred by Adelaide University.
His thesis was titled "Sudden Natural Death in Infancy and Early Childhood - An
Analysis of Aetiological Mechanisms and Pathological
Features".  The thesis
provided an overall classification, analysis and investigative framework for
causes of natural death in infants
and young children.  Subsequently, in 1997,
Professor Byard obtained the degree of Master of Medical Science, again from
the University
of Adelaide.  On this occasion his thesis "Accidental Childhood
Death in South Australia from 1963 to 1996" provided an overview
of accidental
childhood deaths based on a study of 369 cases over a 34 year period.
Professor Byard has published extensively on
the phenomenon of SIDS and
presented as a most impressive witness.  He did not consider the circumstance
that Benjamin and Jack had
normal results on sleep studies to be significant.
He considered that the literature concerning the association between sleep
studies
and their relationship to SIDS to be contradictory.  A great deal of
the sleep study data is based on work conducted by Professor
Andre Kahn in
Belgium.  Professor Byard was somewhat qualified in his views concerning the
Kahn study.  I note that he has had personal
discussions with Dr Kahn
concerning the methodology.  
<P>

52   	Generally, Professor Byard observed that SIDS is a very
heterogenous group of predispositions.  For some children it may be
a problem
with respiratory control, for others a problem with control of the heart, some
children respond badly to external stresses
such as sleeping face downwards or
cigarette smoke.   The suggestion that sleep studies provide a gold standard
test in relation
to SIDS was one with which Professor Byard quite strongly
disagreed.  I note that when Dr Bradhurst sought advice concerning the
cause of
death of Benjamin it was to Professor Byard that he turned.  I do not think
that a great deal of weight, having regard to
the conflict of views concerning
this issue, can be placed on the results of the sleep studies conducted on Jack
and Benjamin.
<P>

<b>Nathan's death - 10 December 1993</b>
<P>

53   	Nathan was brought by ambulance to the Woden Valley
Hospital at 9.26pm on the evening of 10 December 1993.  The history given
was
that the accused had found him unresponsive in bed.  It appears there had been
a fifteen minute wait prior to the arrival of
the ambulance.  When the
ambulance arrived at the home Nathan had no heart beat.  On arrival at the
hospital's emergency department
he had a blood pressure of 90/40 and a pulse of
120 but fixed, dilated pupils (T23).  
<P>

54   	Dr Jain carried out a post mortem examination of Nathan
and concluded that the cause of death was aspiration pneumonia.  Aspiration
pneumonia is to be distinguished from infective pneumonia.  The former is
caused by the aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs.
 It is not a
common phenomenon in a healthy 2&#189; year old child. The body has mechanisms
to prevent the aspiration of gastric
material into the lungs.  
<P>

55   	The significance of Nathan's death on the Crown case is
that, taken together with the other evidence which the Crown presses
on this
application, it is submitted that the tribunal of fact might infer beyond
reasonable doubt that Nathan's death was caused
by the deliberate act of the
accused.  In this respect the Crown advanced two theories:  (i) the accused had
smothered Nathan causing
him to vomit and inhale some of the vomitus (ii) the
accused had put her fingers down Nathan's throat causing him to vomit and then
obstructed his mouth by her hand or some object again causing him to inhale the
vomitus.  To contend that the death of Nathan was
a "related event" for the
purposes of s 98 of the Act in the sense of being relevantly and substantially
similar to the ALTEs and
the deaths of Natalie and Benjamin on this analysis
presents some difficulties.
<P>

56   	The Crown contends as one of the features of relevant
similarity that the accused on each occasion generated a medical emergency
by
causing the child to have breathing difficulties (by suffocation). Thereafter
she arranged for the children to be admitted to
hospital.  This is said to have
taken place against a background of some difficulty in her relationship with
her partner, Ken Skillin.
 It is said that on each occasion Mr Skillin was
absent from the home save on the evening when Natalie died when he was
"unavailable"
 as the result of intoxication.  On this view the deaths of
Benjamin and Natalie were not the outcome which the accused had sought.
Rather, they were the unintended result of her deliberate action in smothering
the children to create a medical emergency justifying
the child's admission to
hospital.  
<P>

57   	The ALTEs and the deaths of Natalie and Benjamin occurred
while each of the children was aged less than twelve months.  Nathan
had no
history of ALTEs.  His death at the age of 2&#189; years might be thought to
fall outside the pattern for which the Crown
contends. By 2 &#189; years
children may be able to put up some resistance to attempts to smother them.
They are able in a limited
way to describe events.   
<P>

58   	The Crown was driven to leading evidence of a highly
speculative nature to explain the mechanism of Nathan's death (accepting
the
child to have died of aspiration pneumonia).  In this regard the evidence that
the accused might have placed her fingers down
the child's throat seems to me
to invite the sort of speculation by medical expert witnesses which was
criticised by the Court in
<b>Straker v The Queen </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2051%20ALJR%20690" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 51 ALJR 690.</a>
<P>

59   	To compound the difficulties concerning the death of
Nathan, I should note that there is controversy concerning the cause
of death.
Dr Jain's autopsy findings revealed that both Nathan's lungs showed acute
bronchopneumonia.  Such a pneumonia may be produced
by the aspiration of
gastric contents but equally may be the result of infection.  
<P>

60   	Professor Plueckhahn reviewed Dr Jain's autopsy findings.
Professor Plueckhahn is an eminent forensic pathologist the co-author
of a
leading text in the field of forensic pathology. He examined the fourteen
histopathology sections of tissues taken at autopsy.
 He agreed with the
finding that both lungs revealed acute bronchopneumonia.  In his view the
microscopic changes in the lungs were
those of an acute bronchopneumonia of at
least four to six hours duration.  He considered such a pneumonia probably
acutely infective
in nature.   Professor Plueckhahn noted that a gram stain on
three lung sections might assist in further elucidating the aetiology
of the
acute response.  Subsequently, Professor Plueckhahn studied three lung slides.
The quality of staining was excellent.  The
slides showed bacteria, the
appearance of which, in his view, was consistent with pneumococcal pneumonia.
The appearance was not
consistent with prior aspiration of gastric contents.
Professor Plueckhahn concluded that attempted manual suffocation played no
part
in Nathan's death.  In his view, the probable cause of death was pneumococcal
pneumonia.  
<P>

61   	Associate Professor Hilton, Director of the New South
Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine, reviewed the post mortem findings
relating to Nathan's death.  In Professor Hilton's view the pathological
findings supported bronchopneumonia as the cause of death.
 He observed:
<P>

"The primary diagnosis here is of focal pneumonia of sufficient severity to at
least be life threatening for a young child but it
is not possible here to be
more firm than to say Nathan Skillin died with focal pneumonia of recent onset.
It is at least possible
that that pneumonia was the direct cause of his death.
Such infections can cause apparent sudden death of a child with little or
no
premonitory signs or symptoms.  The duration of the pneumonic process is at
least of several hours in this case".
<P>

62   	Professor Byard had regard to the x-ray conducted on
Nathan following his admission to hospital and to the reports of Professors
Plueckhahn and Hilton.  I think it fair to observe that Professor Byard
considered the accused's description of Nathan playing uneventfully
not long
before his death to be inconsistent with pneumonia.  Professor Isaacs, who is
expert in the field of infectious diseases
in children, considered the history
of Nathan being apparently well not long before his death to be inconsistent
with him suffering
from pneumonia.  Nonetheless, Professor Byard favoured
infective pneumonia as the probable cause of death.  As I understood his
evidence,
he did so because, notwithstanding a number of circumstances of
suspicion (having regard to the family history) there was physical
evidence
suggestive of infective pneumonia as the cause of death.  In such a case it is
difficult to put that to one side. 
<P>

63   	Dr Booth accepted that Nathan had died of pneumonia.  She
took issue with the significance of the pneumonia in terms of its
role in his
death.  In her view it was likely that Nathan's death was the result of
asphyxia.  She postulated that something had
been done to Nathan to both
interfere with his breathing and to cause him to aspirate vomitus into his
lungs.  As I understood Dr
Booth's evidence she considered that Nathan was
brain dead as the result of asphyxia at the time of his admission to hospital.
Thereafter
he was ventilated.  It is common ground that ventilation can produce
pneumonia.  She considered the rapid onset of pneumonia to be
the result of the
child being ventilated.  Professor Isaacs was of a like mind.  Dr Booth
observed of Professor Hilton and Professor
Plueckhahn's reports:
<P>

"Those findings are entirely consistent still with a non-accidental cause of
death" (T56).
<P>

64   	I did not understand any of the expert witnesses who gave
oral evidence to gainsay the possibility that Nathan had died in
consequence of
a non-accidental cause of death.  This hardly assists the Crown.  
<P>

65   	There remains a real issue as to the cause of Nathan's
death.  A number of highly qualified pathologists (whose field of expertise
is
the determination of causes of death) favour a view that the child's death was
from natural causes as the result of an infective
process.
<P>

<b>Natalie's death - 4 August 1993</b>
<P>

66   	Natalie died on 4 August 1993.  The accused reported
finding the child on her back, apparently having difficulty breathing,
cold,
limp and making a wheezing sound.  She alerted her neighbour, Mrs Stephens, who
came to the house.  Attempts were made at resuscitation.
 On this occasion Ken
Skillin was at home.  At the time when the accused first sought help from Mrs
Stephens Mr Skillin was asleep
having consumed a quantity of alcohol. He was
roused and assisted in the attempts to resuscitate Natalie before she was taken
to
hospital.  Natalie's death was attributed to SIDS.  
<P>

67   	Dr Bradhurst, Professor Byard and Dr Byron Collins would
not be prepared, having regard to the family history, to affirmatively
conclude
that Natalie's death was from SIDS. Her death, like Benjamin's, is unexplained
in the sense that no injury or disease process
was identified.
<P>

68   	As I have noted, the Crown accepts that there are
explanations for the various admissions of Natalie to hospital.  It accepts
that explanations can be found in relation to the ALTEs experienced by Jack and
Benjamin.  The Crown acknowledges that Nathan's death
does not fit within the
pattern in a precise way.  Nonetheless it is contended that, when one takes all
these events into account,
there exists no rational explanation but that they
were brought about by the deliberate acts of the accused.
<P>

69   	In commending a view that the whole of the evidence
pressed by the Crown should be looked at with a view to determining whether
a
reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence had been excluded, the Crown
referred me to the decision of the court in <b>Sutton v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20152%20CLR%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984)
152 CLR 528</a> and particularly to the observations of Dawson J at 567.  His
Honour observed:
<P>

"It is not, I think, a case in which any one circumstance common to the various
offences was sufficiently striking to eliminate
any reasonable possibility of
coincidence.  Rather it was the accumulation of common circumstances which had
that effect.  It is,
of course, possible to consider each similar fact in the
context of other similar facts and conclude that, looked at together, mere
coincidence is not a reasonable hypothesis but be unable to reach that
conclusion viewing each set of similar facts separately."
<P>

70   	The court in <b>Sutton</b> was concerned with the similar
fact evidence rule at common law.  It is to be noted that s 98 of the Act
provides that evidence that
two or more related events occurred is not
admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring
coincidentally,
a person did a particular act unless certain conditions are
satisfied.  Further, as noted above, two or more events are taken to
be related
if, and only if, they are substantially and relevantly similar and the
circumstances in which they occurred are substantially
similar. 
<P>

71   	In this case the Crown has sought to deal with the
requirements of s 98 by specifying by way of points of substantial and
relevant
similarity four criteria of considerable generality (see paragraph 21 above).

<P>

72   	Ms Lyons submits, with some force, that the fourth indicia
of similarity is not established by the evidence.  The Crown makes
a case that
the accused created medical emergencies when her partner was away. On the night
Natalie died Mr Skillin was at home.
Whether he was intoxicated or not seems to
me to have little significance in this context.  It is one thing to contend
that when
there were difficulties in the relationship and Mr Skillin absented
himself the accused would make her children sick in order to
get attention.
Such a theory might, having regard to the various other episodes, have some
credibility.  It does not sit with the
circumstances of Natalie's death.  As Ms
Lyons points out it does not sit entirely comfortably with the circumstances of
Benjamin's
death.  True it is that there is a suggestion that the accused and
Ken Skillen quarrelled earlier on that day about his decision
to go to a rodeo.
Despite this he went to the rodeo. Nonetheless he was returning home in the
ordinary course at the time the accused
sought help for Benjamin.
<P>

73   	As to the second indicia, namely, the accused finding the
children at a time when each child was experiencing breathing difficulties,
I
have some hesitation in seeing that as fairly embracing Natalie's admissions on
7 May or 24 July 1993.  The evidence suggests that
on the former occasion she
had viral croup and on the latter occasion she had, among other problems,
tonsillitis and a middle ear
infection.  I have considerable hesitation about
accepting that indicia is made out with respect to the death of Nathan.  In
this
sense I have some doubts that the Crown has established that the death of
Nathan, and Natalie's admissions on 7 May and 24 July 1993
are "related events"
within the meaning of s 98.  In the light of the view that I take of this
matter it is not necessary for me
to decide the point.
<P>

74   	It is common ground that if a rational hypothesis exists
consistent with the innocence of the accused the evidence as to the
ALTEs and
the two other deaths is not admissible either as coincidence evidence under s
98 or as tendency evidence under s 97.  I
do not consider I can exclude such a
possibility.  
<P>

75   	I should note that the Crown led some evidence from Dr
Seton concerning the statistical chance of three children dying from
failure of
breathing in sleep.  This was expressed as a chance of 1 in 614,000,000.  I am
not persuaded that I can reason towards
the exclusion of a rational possibility
consistent with innocence upon the basis of statistical material of that kind.
This is illustrated
pointedly by the evidence concerning Nathan's cause of
death.  Eminent forensic pathologists consider it probable the child died
of
natural causes.  
<P>

76   	It is to be borne in mind that the fact in issue is the
cause of death of Benjamin.  A vice to be avoided is to proceed upon
an
assumption that Benjamin's death was the result of induced asphyxia in order to
strengthen the inference to be drawn from the
other material as tending to the
view that the various medical emergencies were all the result of the mother's
deliberate acts.
<P>

77   	In <b>Perry v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/75.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 75</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%20580" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 580</a> Gibbs CJ,
in explaining why evidence relating to the death of the accused's brother,
Duncan, was inadmissible, observed:
<P>

"It was not established that Duncan had ingested any poison (except of course
the barbiturates, with whose consumption the applicant
was not shown to have
had anything to do).  It was necessary for the Crown to rely on the other
instances of poisoning, including
those the subject of the present charges, in
an attempt to provide a basis for an inference that Duncan had suffered from
arsenical
poisoning.  In other words, it was necessary to assume the guilt of
the applicant of the offences of which she was charged in order
to render
admissible the evidence regarding the death of Duncan.  Such a line of
reasoning is obviously objectionable". (page 589/90)
<P>

78   	I did not understand any of the witnesses who gave
evidence in the proceedings before me to be of a view other than that the
family history of ALTEs and the deaths of the three children was highly
suspicious.  I note that in a report prepared on 15 November
1996 Professor
Isaacs expressed fears for the safety of Jack should he remain in the care of
the accused.  He went on to express
concerns for the safety of any future
children born to the accused.  It was his recommendation that Jack and future
children be removed
from her care and access to them be severely restricted and
always supervised.  Such a recommendation is understandable in the light
of the
evidence led in these proceedings.
<P>

79   	Professor Byard, although not of the view that each of the
admissions had been shown to be an ALTE, considered that grouped
together they
were a cause for concern.  He said:
<P>

"We certainly have a constellation which is unusual and particularly when you
take it in light of the subsequent history, I think
they have to be viewed
seriously, although individually you can perhaps find an explanation for each
one.  When you look at the whole
constellation, it is and always has been
worrying."
<P>

80   	The Crown submits that I would be satisfied that no
rational explanation exists for the ALTEs and the deaths of Natalie and
Nathan
but that the accused deliberately induced each incident.  A difficulty which to
my mind stands firmly in the way of my so
concluding is that none of the expert
witnesses were prepared to go so far.  Notably, Dr Bradhurst who conducted the
post mortem
examination on Benjamin, considered, taking into account the whole
of the sibling history including the deaths of Natalie and Nathan,
that "the
most likely cause of Benjamin's death was induced asphyxia".  That was as high
as Dr Bradhurst would take it.  Professor
Byard, for the reasons set out above,
considered the history a suspicious one.  He, like Dr Bradhurst, would withhold
a diagnosis
of SIDS in the case of the death of Benjamin and Natalie.  This is
a different matter to affirmatively concluding that the deaths
were the result
of induced asphyxia.  
<P>

81   	I did not understand any expert called to express the
opinion that the sibling history of ALTEs together with the deaths of
Natalie
and Nathan in combination compelled a view that Benjamin's death was the result
of induced asphyxia.  
<P>

82   	I do not consider that the evidence of the ALTEs or of the
deaths of Natalie and Nathan meet the test for admissibility provided
by s
101(2) of the Act.  Accordingly, I would reject the evidence both pursuant to
ss 97 and 98.   
<P>

83   	The Crown Prosecutor opened upon the basis that the
evidence of the ALTEs and the deaths of Natalie and Nathan was pressed
as
coincidence evidence.  He sought to preserve his position with respect to its
admissibility as evidence of tendency.  In written
submissions, handed up at
the conclusion of the hearing, it was further contended that some portion of
the evidence was admissible
as evidence of relationship.  I say some portion of
the evidence for the reason that in written submissions the Crown referred to
evidence detailed in annexure "B" as admissible either as tendency or
alternatively relationship evidence.  The submissions had been
prepared
overnight and the Crown Prosecutor did not have annexure "B" available to hand
up.  In the submissions the matter is put
this way:
<P>

"The relevant relationship in this case is that between the accused and her
children.  (The sibling history is independently admissible
as the basis of
expert medical opinion - <b>R v Welsh</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=90%20A%20Crim%20R%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">90 A Crim R 364).</a>  
<P>

Relationship evidence has survived in NSW after the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> as a

356</a>;  <b>R v Fraser</b> (unreported, NSW CCA, 10/8/98);  <b>R v Seratore</b>
(unreported, NSW CCA, 26/11/99).  The relevance of relationship evidence
depends upon the issues in the trial.  It is admissible
when it may reasonably
be treated as explanatory of the charged conduct or if it assists in the choice
between two explanations of
an occurrence:  <b>Wilson v R</b> (1970) 123 CLR at
337 and <b>R v Pavia</b>, NSW Supreme Court (Grove J) 16/2/93".  
<P>

84   	I have difficulty in seeing how evidence might be
admissible concerning the ALTEs and the deaths of Nathan and Natalie under
the
rubric of relationship evidence.  Evidence of a violent relationship may be
admitted in a murder trial because of its relevance
to a fact in issue; eg:
whether the death was accidental.  In <b>R v Frawley</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2069%20A%20Crim%20R%20208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 69 A Crim R 208</a>
Gleeson CJ (as he then was) cautioned against the ready use of the label
"relationship evidence".  His Honour emphasised the need
to describe with
accuracy and precision the basis upon which the evidence was said to be
admissible.
<P>

85   	Once it is accepted that the evidence concerning the
medical history of the siblings and the deaths of Natalie and Nathan
do not
meet the requirements of s 101(2) of the Act to prove the accused had a
tendency to act in a particular way, namely, to physically
harm her children, I
have difficulty in seeing how the whole or some portion of this evidence might
be admitted relevantly as bearing
on the relationship between the accused and
the deceased.
<P>

86   	The Crown also sought to lead evidence concerning two
other medical events relating to Natalie.  On 7 May 1993, when admitted
to the
Woden Valley Hospital, Natalie was observed to have a cigarette burn on her
hand.  On 28 May 1993 she presented at Calvary
Hospital with a hairline
fracture of the right ulna.  The Crown did not contend these episodes were
admissible as coincidence evidence
pursuant to s 98.  It was submitted that
they were admissible pursuant to s 97 as evidencing the accused's tendency to
physically
injure her children.  
<P>

87   	The cigarette burn was to the child's finger.  On the
occasion of the admission the accused appears to have told hospital
staff that
it was an accidental cigarette burn.  She was noted to be affected by alcohol
on that occasion.  There was evidence that
deliberate cigarette burns to
children's hands tend to be to the palm.  Deliberately inflicted burns to the
finger are not common
(T 38). 
<P>

88   	The accused gave an account that Natalie had fallen from
her bed as an explanation for the hairline fracture.  The paediatric
evidence
was that falling from a bed was a possible explanation for such a fracture.
Fractures of this kind in infant children are

<P>

89   	I do not consider that the evidence of the burn or of the
hairline fracture meets the test imposed by s 102(2) of the Act.

reject it.
<P>

90   	I reject the admission pursuant to ss 98 and 97 of the Act
of the whole of the material tendered by the Crown on this application.
