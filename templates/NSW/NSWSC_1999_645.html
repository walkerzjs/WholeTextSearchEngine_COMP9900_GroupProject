<b>29 June 1999</b>
<P>

1   	What follows are my reasons for making the orders to-day
that the winding-up of the Defendant be terminated pursuant to s482(1)
of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, such orders being expanded to include relevantly
orders 2, 3 and 4 quoted below, with liberty to apply to cater for unforeseen
circumstances.
<P>

"2.	Intag, without further order of the Court, be wound up in the event that
the assignment of receivables as referred to in the
letter of AAIL to Sims
Lockwood dated 17 June 1999 and annexed hereto and marked "<u>A</u>" is not
executed by 7 July 1999;
<P>

3.	Intag, without further order of the Court, be wound up in the event that $2
million is not received by it in cash by 31 December
1999, such sum being the
sum referred to in the paragraph numbered 2 of the undertaking of AAIL filed
herein and dated 29 June 1999;
<P>

4.	in the event of Intag being wound up pursuant to orders 2 and 3, the Court
appoints the administrator and liquidator, Mr Anthony
Sims as the
liquidator;"

3   	These orders have been made following undertakings which
deal with several matters bearing upon the proper exercise of the
Court's
discretion. Not only must the solvency of the Company be sufficiently assured,
though that is of critical importance. In
addition, the Court must consider
whether such a termination will be conducive or detrimental to commercial
morality and the interests
of the public at large, as has been settled by a
long line of authority. Thus, see <i>Re Telescriptor Syndicate Ltd</i> [1903] 2
Ch 175; <i>Re Mascot Home Furnishers Pty Ltd (in liq)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1970/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] VicRp 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20VR%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] VR 593</a>; <i>Re

Enterprises Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20ACLC%20910" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1 ACLC 910</a>; <i>Re Skay Fashions Pty Ltd (in

<P>

4   	Those considerations were also clearly present in the mind
of Young J when this matter came before him on 2 June 1999 by way
of an
application under s436B(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> for leave for the
Liquidator to be appointed Administrator. Indeed it is from the efforts of the
Liquidator in that dual role that
a salvage proposal has emerged leading to the
execution of a Deed of Company Arrangement ("DCA") on 25 June 1999 in a
commercial
context and with the subventions elaborated in the Liquidator's
report of 28 June 1999. The Liquidator concludes that the best return
to the
unsecured creditors of the Company will be achieved if the DCA is implemented
and which can only occur if the liquidation
is terminated. At para 31 the
Liquidator concludes:  
<P>

"31.	Based upon information available to me from both the board of directors of
the Company and AAIL, I am reasonably satisfied
that AAIL will be able to meet
its financial commitments pursuant to the Deed of Company Arrangement, that the
Company will be in
a position to pay its debts as and when they fall due if the
liquidation of the Company is terminated and that based upon the projected
cash
flow, the Company should be in a position to trade solvently."
<P>

5   	It is apparent from the DCA that there are a number of
critical steps which depend upon liquidation terminating. These essentially
relate to payments elaborated in the DCA from a listed company Australian
Authorised Investments Limited ("AAIL"). AAIL is engaged
in the
telecommunications business whilst Intag is involved in what are called
smartcards, being cards in which is embedded a microchip
for various uses such
to effect payments by computer.
<P>

6   	The undertakings which I have required are directed at the
following:
<P>

(a)	ensuring that AAIL makes the payments which are said to be sufficient for
Intag's future solvency, and
<P>

(b)	ensuring that a board is in place which includes 
<P>

(i)	no director who has been the subject of criticism in the Liquidator's
report earlier referred to and the Administrator's report
pursuant to s438D
dated 25 June 1999 though in Dr Solomon's case not precluding his future
non-directorial involvement under proper
arrangements whereby his expertise can
be made available though not at senior executive level, and
<P>

(ii)	a director still to be appointed with requisite commercial experience and
of good standing and reputation to be added to the
newly appointed His Royal
Highness Tunku who is, I understand, a leading Malaysian businessman.
<P>

7   	In addition, the undertakings require that a competent
independent financial controller of good standing and reputation is
immediately
appointed on an acting basis, to be replaced by a permanent appointment by 30
September 1999.
<P>

8   	As further assurance that the relevant payments will be
received, and in particular the critical payment of $2 million to be
derived
from the assignment of receivables and to be paid in cash by 31 December 1999,
the orders provide that Intag will be wound
up without further order should
either:
<P>

(a)	the assignment of those receivables not be executed by 7 July 1999, or
<P>

(b)	the payment therefrom in an amount of not less than $2 million fail to be
received in cash by 31 December 1999.
<P>

9   	It will be appreciated that the interests of the public at
large and commercial morality are best served by precluding the
return from
liquidation of companies whose solvency is still questionable or whose past
insolvency is the result of mismanagement
where no adequate steps have been
taken to correct it including removal of those responsible from directorial or
senior executive
responsibility. Thus it is important to have adequate
assurance that the restored company has arrangements in place to correct for
the future those causes of its past failure.
<P>

10   	It is therefore not enough merely to look to solvency
though that is a necessary condition of terminating liquidation. I am
satisfied
that in the present case, there is a sufficient basis of assurance that the
Company has put in place adequate arrangements
to address both solvency and
future management for me to make the earlier orders.  While certainty in these
matters is not possible,
there is the sanction of a self-executing order that
the Company returns to winding-up if that assurance is disappointed. If perfect
certainty were required, the intention of permitting administration to see if a
company were salvageable would be frustrated.
