<b>JUDGMENT  --  </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>17 December 1999</b>
<P>

1   	I give brief reasons for the orders I have just made in
relation to granting of Probate of the late Alan Oakley Smith's 1995
Will.
These reasons deal with why I have not made orders granting probate to the 1998
Will, each of such wills as being identified
in the Plaintiffs' Summons and the
short Minutes of Order.
<P>

2   	The principal difference between the two Wills is that the
second 1998 Will in clause 9 provides a different disposition of
one-third of
residue.  Instead of that disposition going absolutely to the deceased's son
Malcolm, he being one of two sons who have
earlier received one-third each in
the 1995 Will, that disposition is to the two grandchildren of the deceased
(Malcolm's two sons).
 This is under a clause of some complexity.  That
complexity bears upon the basis for rejecting the 1998 Will as one where I am
not
satisfied that the deceased "knew and approved" it, as required for
validity, where the deceased at the time of 1998 Will was blind.
<P>

3   	The arrangement in the 1998 Will, drawn by a solicitor of
great competence Miss Jean Hill, is expressed in these terms:
<P>

"(c)	To set aside one third of my residuary estate in a Testamentary Trust for
my grandsons LACHLAN SMITH and GRAHAM SMITH  AND
I APPOINT  as Trustees of this
Testamentary Trust the persons who are the partners of the firm Hill Thomson
and Sullivan, Solicitors
of 13/9 Hunter Street, Sydney at the date of my death
AND I DECLARE  that such Trustees may be employed or act and shall be entitled
to charge and be paid all professional or other charges for any act done by him
or his firm in connection with the Trust  AND I DIRECT
 that the assets of this
Trust or the balance then remaining shall be distributed to my said grandsons
in equal shares on the younger
grandson attaining the age of forty years  AND I
FURTHER DIRECT  that until such final distribution the Trustees shall in their
absolute
discretion have the power to apply for the benefit of either
beneficiary so much of the income from the contingent share of each
beneficiary
and up to one-half of the capital of such contingent share towards the needs in
life of each such beneficiary."
<P>

4   	The complexity to which I have earlier referred, though
capable of resolution as a matter of <i>interpretation</i> (as distinct from
knowledge and approval) according to principles applicable to wills and their
interpretation include:
<P>

(i)	were the grandchildren to have the right under principles of <i>Saunders v
Vautier</i>, to terminate the trust earlier, and
<P>

(ii)	what would happen if one grandchild say, were to die before distribution
--  would it go to the other, or to the grandchild's
children, or on an
intestacy.
<P>

There is no suggestion that those complexities were ever taken up with the
testator and clarified.
<P>

5   	I should note for completeness that the remaining
two-thirds go as to one-third to the deceased's de facto wife and as to the
other one-third to the deceased's other son, Ian, this being the case both with
the 1995 and 1998 Wills.
<P>

6   	Added to that is the crucial fact that the deceased though
not lacking testamentary capacity or mental acumen, despite his
advanced age
(93 for the 1998 Will), was essentially blind resulting from a deterioration
which took place over some three years.
 That blindness did not affect his 1995
Will as it had yet to become serious enough to do so.  But it is evident from
the signature
on the two Wills that the deterioration substantially occurred
between them.
<P>

7   	On the evidence, the deceased had telephoned Miss Hill with
his instructions.  She had prepared the Will intending to give
effect to those
instructions but she was not an attesting witness to the 1998 Will.  There is
no evidence that the 1998 Will was
read over to the deceased such as would
establish that, being blind, he nonetheless knew and approved of its contents,
as required
by Pt 78 r16 SCR and by the law obtaining to the validity of wills.
Nor does the attestation conform to that recommended by the late
the Hon.
Francis Hutley in "Australian Wills Precedents" (Butterworths, 1974) at 84 (and
see earlier at 81-83) which confirms that
the will was read to the testator.
<P>

8   	The nearest there is to any evidence supportive of the
validity of the 1998 Will is the affidavit of a friend Aileen Collins,
paras 6
and 7 of which read as follows, but they fall well short of confirming he knew
and approved the 1998 Will, with the complexities
I have earlier described.
Those unresolved complexities, never clarified as in a process of reading back
the will or otherwise, make
it intrinsically unlikely that the deceased,
intelligent and with full acumen as he may well still have been despite his
frailty,
could have "known and approved" the essentials of the change to clause
9.  The position might have been otherwise with a quite simple
change;  this
was not.
<P>

"I recall the evening of 16th September 1998.  John Forsyth and I visited the
deceased and Trude at Lakemba for dinner.  During
the evening, the deceased
asked if we could witness his will.  He then produced a document which I
observed was headed "This is the
Last Will and Testament of me Alan Oakley
Smith" and he proceeded to sign this document on each page.  John Forsyth and
myself then
signed each page of the document.
<P>

I do not recall any specific discussion as to the contents of the will except
that I recall the deceased saying words to the effect
of `Not everyone will be
pleased with this new will but it is what I want'."
<P>

9   	The principles pertaining to knowledge and approval of a
will are conveniently set out in my judgement in <i>Pates v Craig</i> (Santow
J, 28 August 1995, unreported) at 6:
<P>

"6.	If a testamentary instrument is to constitute the last will and testament
of its maker, the Court must be satisfied that maker
knew of its contents and
approved of their purport at the time of execution. The onus lies on the party
propounding the document
to show that it was the subject of the testator's
knowledge and approval. However, unless suspicion attaches to the document
propounded,
the testator's due execution of it is sufficient evidence of his or
her knowledge and approval: <i>Re Hodges</i> (supra); <i>Guardhouse v.
Blackburn</i> (1866) LR 1 P &amp; D 109.
<P>

7.	Where facts are proved which raise a suspicion that the will does not
express the intention of the deceased, knowledge and approval
will not be
presumed from the fact of due execution. Rather the propounder of the will has
the burden of removing the suspicion by
proving affirmatively that the deceased
knew and approved of the contents of the document. Some only of the
circumstances which may
cause suspicion to attach to a document include,
relevantly:
<P>

(a)	The circumstance that the person who prepared, or procured the execution
of, the document receives a benefit under it is one
which should generally
arouse suspicion and call for vigilant examination of the evidence as to the
deceased's appreciation and approval
of the contents of the will:  <i>Re
Hodges</i> at 705; <i>Barry v. Butlin</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1838/1056.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1838] EngR 1056</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281838%29%2012%20ER%201089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1838) 12 ER 1089</a>; <i>Nock v.
Austin</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1918] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2025%20CLR%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 25 CLR 519</a> at 528; <i>Public Trustee v. McKeon</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1917/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1917] NSWStRp 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281917%29%2017%20SR%28NSW%29%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1917) 17
SR(NSW) 157.</a>
<P>

(b)	Where the alleged testator was enfeebled, illiterate or blind when he
executed the document, it must be shown by affidavit that
the will was read
over to the deceased before its execution, or that the deceased otherwise was
aware of the contents of the testamentary
document: <i>Tyrrell v. Painton</i>
[1894] P151; <i>Kenny v. Wilson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1911/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1911] NSWStRp 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%2011%20SR%28NSW%29%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 11 SR(NSW) 460</a> at 469; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1911/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1911] NSWStRp 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=28%20WN%28NSW%29%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">28 WN(NSW)
124.</a>
<P>

8.	Where there is no question of fraud, the fact that a will has been read over
to or by a capable testator affords a strong presumption
that he or she knew
and approved of its contents:  <i>Re Hodges</i>  at 705; <i>Guardhouse v.
Blackburn</i> (1866) LR 1 P &amp; D 109; <i>Fulton v. Andrew</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281875%29%20LR%207%20HL%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1875) LR 7 HL
448</a>; <i>Gregson v. Taylor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%20P%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] P 256.</a>
<P>

10   	Applying those principles to the present case, the
propounder of the testamentary instrument, in circumstances where, as here
because of blindness, suspicion attaches to the document propounded, has the
evidentiary onus of dispelling the suspicion.  That,
in the case of a blind
testator, requires evidence that the Will was read over to the deceased before
its execution or that the deceased
was otherwise aware of the contents.  The
intrinsic complexity of the change (see para 4 above) coupled with the absence
of any evidence
that the Will <i>was</i> ever read over or otherwise discussed
after it had been drafted, renders it unlikely that he was sufficiently aware
of its contents
for the Court to be satisfied that the Will was known and
approved by the deceased.
<P>

11   	In the present case, the solicitors for Mr Mark Hayler,
who is one of the three executors and who is the effective contradictor,
has
properly chosen neither to consent nor oppose the orders sought by the
Plaintiffs being the other two executors who are the two
sons of the deceased.
The two grandchildren of the deceased who stand to benefit by the 1998 Will in
comparison to the 1995 Will
have been independently advised and have declined
to put any matters in opposition to such order as the Court may make.
<P>

12   	Counsel for these Plaintiffs has properly and fairly set
out the evidence bearing upon whether the orders sought should be
made.  Based
simply upon that evidence and without resort to any problematic notion of
compromise which would have analogised the
Defendant's not opposing position to
one of consent and would have assumed testamentary validity could properly be
the subject of
compromise, I am satisfied that the 1998 Will should not be
admitted to probate.  It is not then in doubt that the 1995 Will should
be
admitted to probate.
<P>

13   	It remains for me to express my appreciation to the legal
advisers and to the members of the family who have dealt with the
matter
sensitively and with a conscientious concern for ensuring that the matter is
dealt with properly in accordance with testamentary
requirements.
