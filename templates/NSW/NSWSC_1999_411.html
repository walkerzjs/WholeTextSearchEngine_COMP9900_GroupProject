<b>JUDGMENT (On tender by plaintiff of documents relevant to Defendant's
Amendment Application and Plaintiff's Application to Set Aside
Police
Subpoena)</b>
<P>

1	The documents tendered are contained in a grey ring binder behind fifty six
tabs.
<P>

2	During the course of submissions the following documents were not pressed:
2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 19, 20, 53, 54 and 56.
<P>

3	During the course of submissions objection was <i>not</i> taken to the
following documents:  1, 9, 12, 14, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
45, 46, 47, 48, 49 and 55.
<P>

4	Accordingly, the documents in issue are 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21-27, 39-44 and
50-52.
<P>

5	Being tendered on both applications, the areas of relevance contended for
include the dealings between Mr Quail on behalf of the
defendant and the
Police;  the fact and implementation of the asserted agreement between the
defendant's solicitors and the Police;
 the promptitude with which some
particulars were supplied in light of information possessed compared with
asserted delay in the
supply of others;  the partiality of the Police in
dealing with the subpoena issued by the plaintiff and that by the defendant;
the
position of the Police in respect of any application for a stay of the
civil proceedings.
<P>

6	I rule as follows:
<P>

5 - admitted.
<P>

15 - admitted.
<P>

16 - admitted.
<P>

17 - admitted.
<P>

18 - admitted:  this is not admitted as evidence of the truth of its contents
but merely as to the fact of its existence.
<P>

21 - admitted.
<P>

22 - admitted.
<P>

23 - admitted:  it is the fact of the application made before Ireland J and his
Honour's judgment of 24 December 1998 that is of
fundamental relevance.  It is
merely by reference to his Honour referring to the submissions advanced for the
parties and particularly
those in writing that I admit this material to the
extent that it may aid the consideration of the significance of the application
and its resolution by Ireland J.
<P>

24 - admitted.
<P>

25 - admitted.
<P>

26 - admitted.
<P>

27 - admitted:  <i>Note</i> the letter dated 24 December 1998 must be included.

<P>

39 - admitted.
<P>

40 - admitted.
<P>

41 - admitted.
<P>

42 - admitted.
<P>

43 - admitted.
<P>

44 - admitted.
<P>

50 - admitted.
<P>

51 - admitted.
<P>

52 - admitted.
<P>

7	The above documents, it is to be noted, are admitted over objection.
<P>

8	Thus, of the fifty six documents originally tendered the following are
admitted into evidence:  1, 5, 9, 12, 14-18, 21-52 and
55.
<P>

9	These documents are retained in the original folder, behind their original
tabs and will be admitted as Exhibit 11. 
<P>

10	Documents <i>not</i> admitted have been removed and together with their
original tabs will be returned to the plaintiff's lawyers and marked for
identification
24.
