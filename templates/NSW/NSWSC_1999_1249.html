<b><u>THE OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY   V.   D'JAMIRZE &amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The properties 7 Metella Road, Toongabbie (Folio Identifier
18/L/10697) and 9 Metella Road, Toongabbie (Folio Identifier 17/L/10697)
are
registered as owned by Valentina D'Jamirze, Alick D'Jamirze, Vladimir
D'Jamirze, Zifira D'Jamirze, Yuri D'Jamirze, Victor D'Jamirze,
Mickhail
D'Jamirze, Zarema D'Jamirze, Nickolai D'Jamirze, Medeya D'Jamirze and Alexandre
D'Jamirze as joint tenants.  For convenience,
I will refer to these persons by
their Christian names.  
<P>

2  	Valentina, who was the mother of all the other joint tenants (who
are accordingly brothers and sisters) died prior to 14th August
1997.  Alick,
Vladimir, Yuri, Victor and Nickolai became bankrupt prior to 14th August 1997.

<P>

3  	In these proceedings, commenced on 14th August 1997, the
plaintiff The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy seeks an order against
the
bankrupts that he be registered in their place on the title to the properties,
and against all joint tenants that trustees for
sale be appointed.  
<P>

4  	Alexandre Fedotov, the husband of Zifira, claims that the
bankrupts, and also Michael and Alexandre, mortgaged their interests
in the
properties to him prior to the occurrence of the bankruptcies.  He has been
joined as a defendant in the proceedings, and
he has applied to put on a
cross-claim seeking a declaration of his interest and consequential relief.
<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

5  	I will commence by outlining facts which are either clearly
proved or not in dispute.
<P>

6  	In 1989, members of the D'Jamirze family incorporated a number of
companies:  D'Jamirze Family Enterprises Pty. Limited, Razvitie
FSP Pty.
Limited, and Antonov Airlines (Cargo Services) Pty. Limited.  The business of
the second of these was stated to be aircraft
maintenance, and that of the
third was stated to be air transport (cargo and services). 
<P>

7  	No.7 Metella Road was acquired by the joint tenants in about July
1990 for $312,000.00, and No.9 Metella Road was acquired by
them in about May
1991 for $190,000.00.
<P>

8  	In about July 1991, it appears that the joint tenants executed a
Deed relating to No.7 Metella Road.  The operative parts of
the Deed were in
the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>A.	The parties to this Deed entered into an agreement dated 27 July 1990
as Purchasers to purchase the property situate at 7 Metella
Road, Toongabbie in
the State of New South Wales being the land more particularly described in
Folio Identifier 18/L/10697 ("the
Property") from Vince Sgro as Vendor ("the
Agreement").</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>B.	On 31 August 1990 the parties to this Deed completed the Agreement
("the Completion Date") and became the registered proprietors
of the Property
as Joint Tenants (hereafter referred to collectively as "the Registered
Proprietors").</i></b>
<P>

<b><cite>NOW THIS DEED WITNESSETH</cite><i> as follows:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>1.	The Registered Proprietors shall hold a meeting with all Registered
Proprietors present within 12 months of the anniversary of
the Completion Date
and thereafter on or by the anniversary of the Completion Date in subsequent
years ("the Meeting").</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>2.	The Meeting shall be held to review whether the Property is to be
sold.  If a majority of the Registered Proprietors present at
the Meeting
require the Property to be sold, the Property is to be placed on the market
within three (3) months from the date of
the Meeting after first obtaining a
valuation from 2 licensed real estate agents, which licensed real estate agents
are to be agreed
upon by a majority of the Registered Proprietors, with the
costs of the valuations to be borne equally by the Registered Proprietors
and a
decision made by at least a majority of the Registered Proprietors to nominate
within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the
second valuation one of the two
licensed real estate agents as the real estate agent to sell the
Property.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>3.	If a Registered Proprietor is sued or Registered Proprietors are sued
the Registered Proprietor or Registered Proprietors shall
immediately inform
the remaining Registered Proprietors of the dispute and if in the opinion of
the remaining Registered Proprietors
they determine the dispute will or may
affect the interest of the Registered Proprietors in the Property, the
Registered Proprietor
or Registered Proprietors shall immediately transfer his,
her or their interest in the Property to the remaining Registered Proprietors
at his, her or their expense.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>4.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 1 hereof, the Registered
Proprietors agree that if any one of them wishes to sell their
interest in the
Property the Registered Proprietor shall offer his or her share in writing to
all remaining or surviving Registered
Proprietors, and the Registered
Proprietor or Registered Proprietors prepared to offer the highest amount for
the share or interest
in the Property shall be the Purchaser of it.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>5.	No Registered Proprietor shall offer his or her share or interest in
the Property to any person who is not a party to this Deed.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>6.	The provisions of this Deed may be varied only by the mutual agreement
of the remaining Registered Proprietors of the Property
at the time of
variation of this Deed.</i></b>
<P>

9  	There is in evidence a document in Russian purporting to be an
agreement made in Moscow on 3rd September 1991 between seven
of the registered
proprietors and Mr. Fedotov.  In English, the document reads as follows:
<P>

<b><i>Present agreement is made between citizen Alexander FEDOTOV and citizens
(Alexander, Yuriy, Alik, Victor, Mikhail, Nikolay, Vladimir)
D'JAMIRZE.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Citizens D'JAMIRZE give their part of interest in real estate and land
property (7 and 9 Metalla (sic) Road, Toongaby (sic), Sydney,
NSW, Australia)
to citizen Alexander FEDOTOV in exchange for the amount of 700 thousand (seven
hundred thousand) US Dollars (its
equivalent in Roubles).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Alexander D'jamirze (signature)		Alexander Fedotov</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>						(signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Yuriy D'jamirze (signature)			(signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Alik D'jamirze (signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Victor D'jamirze (signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Mikhail D'jamirze (signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Nikolay D'jamirze (signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Vladimir D'jamirze (signature)</i></b>
<P>

I will refer later to evidence concerning the circumstances of the making of
this document.
<P>

10  	There is also in evidence another document in Russian purporting
to be a receipt dated 12th September 1991.  In English, this
document reads as
follows:
<P>

<b><i>Present receipt is issued to citizen Alexander Fedotov certifying that he
handed over an amount of 700 thousand (seven hundred thousand)
US Dollars in
its equivalent in Roubles, at a rate of 1 to 50.  The amount is handed over on
behalf of citizens D'jamirze (Alexander,
Yuriy, Alik, Victor, Mikhail, Nikolay,
Vladimir).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>In its turn, "Razvitie" firm commits itself to pay the above mentioned
amount to the Military Air Forces of Russia on behalf of the
directors of
"Anatov Airlines" firm citizens D'jamirze (Alexander, Yuriy, Alik, Victor,
Mikhail, Nikolay, Vladimir).  Present amount
of money is paid for exploiting
aircraft.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>12.09.91</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>O. Karpov (signature)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Commercial Director of FSP "Razvitie"</i></b>
<P>

11  	The receipt document was not admitted as evidence of the truth
of its contents, but merely to show that Mr. Fedotov did obtain
a document
purporting to be a receipt in respect of his alleged payment of money.
<P>

12  	There is also in evidence a letter dated 6th July 1992 to
Vladimir from Robin Hunt, a solicitor who was then acting for members
of the
D'Jamirze family.  The body of this letter was as follows:
<P>

<b><i>As discussed earlier today with Victor, we have forwarded a letter to
Esanda concerning your loan application.  A copy of this letter
is attached for
your information.</i></b>
<P>

13  	There was attached to this letter a letter of the same date
address to Esanda, in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>Our firm has for approximately five years acted for Mr. Victor D'Jamirze,
Mr. Vladimir D'Jamirze and various other members of the
D'Jamirze
family.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>D'Jamirze Family Enterprises Pty. Limited and the Anotov Airlines Company
both have their registered offices at our premises.  We
have taken instructions
in connection with various commercial enterprises for the Companies and other
matters.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We hereby certify that the abovenamed persons have considerable assets
including unemcumbered (sic) real estate at Toongabbie and
that their family
companies are going concerns.</i></b>
<P>

14  	The copies of these letters were produced from the solicitor's
files:  neither Vladimir nor Victor acknowledged receipt or
knowledge of these
letters.  
<P>

15  	On 11th March 1993, Mr. Fedotov migrated to Australia.  Evidence
was given that shortly afterwards he was given the certificates
of title to the
subject properties.  
<P>

16  	There is in evidence a facsimile dated 27th January 1994
addressed to Victor from Robin Hunt, the last paragraph of which reads
as
follows:
<P>

<b><i>So far as the certificates of title for 7 and 9 Metella Road, Toongabbie
are concerned, as already discussed with you on an earlier
occasion, Nick
Lazaris collected the deeds from us on 26 March 1992 and signed a receipt at
that time.  The deeds were handed to
him in response to the telephone request
to our accounts department made by Vladimir.</i></b>
<P>

17  	It appears that the bankrupts became so as follows:
<P>

&#183;	Alick, by sequestration order dated 14th April 1994, on act of
bankruptcy dated 16th July 1993.
<P>

&#183;	Vladimir, by sequestration order dated 8th September 1994, on act of
bankruptcy dated 1st February 1994.
<P>

&#183;	Yuri, by sequestration order dated 8th December 1991, on act of
bankruptcy dated 12th July 1991.
<P>

&#183;	Victor, by sequestration order dated 1st November 1994, on act of
bankruptcy dated 21st January 1994.
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	Nickolai, by sequestration order dated 1st November 1994, on act of
bankruptcy dated 21st January 1994.
<P>

18  	The Statements of Affairs of the bankrupts (filed respectively
on 19th September 1994, 11th November 1994, 21st December 1994,
16th December
1994, and 12th January 1995, made no reference either to the respective
bankrupts' interest in the subject properties
or to any secured (or any) debt
to Mr. Fedotov.  
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

19  	It was not disputed that, subject to such interest if any as Mr.
Fedotov acquired, The Official Trustee became entitled to
the interests of the
bankrupts in the properties, such title relating back to the relevant act of
bankruptcy:  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.58(5)</a>, <u>Sonenco (No.77) Pty. Ltd. v.
Silva</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/89.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 89</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2024%20FCR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 24 FCR 105</a> at 112.  All the real issues in the case concerned
Mr. Fedotov's claim.
<P>

20  	There were substantial factual issues in this case concerning
the circumstances of the alleged agreement and the alleged deposit
of title
deeds.  These involved questions of credit.  
<P>

21  	There was no real dispute as to the legal effect of the
agreement, if made; but the agreement was not stamped until the hearing
of the
proceedings, and there was an issue whether that stamping could have the effect
of retrospectively taking the property out
of the ownership of The Official
Trustee.
<P>

22  	Next, assuming the agreement was made and that the stamping was
effective to displace the title of The Official Trustee, there
was a question
whether the agreement could affect the interest of Yuri, whose bankruptcy was
based on an act of bankruptcy committed
before the date of the agreement.  That
gave rise particularly to a question concerning the ordinary course of
business.
<P>

23  	Finally, there was the question whether the deposit of title
deeds itself gave rise to an equitable charge which could prevail
over the
title of The Official Trustee.  
<P>

<b><u>FACTUAL ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Evidence</u></b>
<P>

24  	I will briefly outline significant evidence given in the case.
Vladimir gave evidence that in 1989 an entity known as "Razvitie
Russia",
associated with the D'Jamirze companies, entered into a joint venture with the
USSR Air Force to lease four aeroplanes to
carry cargo around the world,
particularly livestock and heavy machinery.  The name Antonov Airlines was
used.  This entity operated
for about two years.  Its planes were maintained at
an Air Force Base near Moscow.  It paid a licence fee to the USSR Air Force.
According to Vladimir, he was responsible for negotiating contractual and
financial arrangements for this entity.  
<P>

25  	Vladimir also gave evidence that between 1985 and 1989, the
D'Jamirze family kept a permanent suite of rooms at the Hotel Rossiy
in Moscow.
(It may be that this continued through until 1991).  Vladimir says he was
introduced to Mr. Fedotov by the security chief
of the hotel.  
<P>

26  	Vladimir gave evidence that in 1991, Rasvitie Russia was
experiencing cash flow difficulties, and need to pay about $US700,000.00
to the
USSR Air Force for licence fees.  In a conversation with Mr. Fedotov, Mr.
Fedotov had said that he had money in a bank, was
concerned about losing it,
and was looking for a suitable business investment.  According to Vladimir, he
told Mr. Fedotov about
the $US700,000.00 arrears of licence fees, and discussed
a loan of that amount, also saying words to the effect:  "If you are worried
about the security of Russian banks, we can offer you security over our home in
Australia".  According to Vladimir, shortly afterwards
Mr. Fedotov said to him
that he had discussed the matter with his brother and decided to proceed.  
<P>

27  	According to Vladimir, the document was prepared, signatures
from his brothers were obtained, he and Mr. Fedotov put on the
final
signatures, $US700,000.00 in roubles was collected in cash from Mr. Fedotov's
bank, placed in two large suitcases, and couriered
to the Soviet Air Force.
<P>

28  	Vladimir also gave evidence that, shortly after Mr. Fedotov came
to Australia, he gave him the certificates of title.  Evidence
was given on the
voir dire concerning authorisation from other members of the family, but this
was never admitted into evidence in
the case.  According to Vladimir, the title
deeds thereafter remained in the house, at some stage in a filing cabinet,
another stage
in a drawer, and at another stage in a safe.  
<P>

29  	Victor gave evidence that he was the chairman of Razvitie
Russia, and responsible for its day to day operations.  There is
in evidence an
advertisement placed in the Australian Financial Review for Antonov Airlines,
showing Victor as the chairman.  Victor
gave evidence that he was in Moscow in
September 1991, a time of great upheaval in Moscow.  He gave evidence of
conversations with
Vladimir concerning the transaction and concerning the
signing of the document.  He believes that he signed the document in Moscow.

<P>

30  	Victor, Alexandre, Nickolai and Alick gave evidence of similar
conversations with Vladimir, and that they signed the document.
 However, their
evidence was unclear as to whether the document was signed in Moscow, or in
Australia, or possibly in an aircraft.
 The passports of the brothers were
subpoenaed, but only those of Vladimir, Alexandre and Nickolai are in evidence.
It is fair to
say that the passports of Vladimir and Alexandre tend to support
the view that they were in Moscow in September 1991.  Nickolai's
passport
indicates an arrival in Australia on 15th July 1991, and a departure from
Australia on 5th October in a year which would
appear to be 1991.  One further
particular piece of evidence that I note is that Alick gave evidence to the
effect that the transaction
was discussed many times in many different places.

<P>

31  	Mikhail gave evidence that his signature was on the document,
but he could not recall any circumstances.  He could not recall
whether he left
Australia in 1991.  
<P>

32  	Mr. Fedotov gave evidence that he first met members of the
D'Jamirze family in about mid-1991.  However, in his oral evidence,
he said
that he was aware that Vladimir and Victor were in Moscow in September 1991,
but not whether the other brothers were.  In
his affidavit, Mr. Fedotov said
that at his initial meeting, he arranged with Vladimir to meet later, and they
did so at the offices
of Razvitie in a suburb of Moscow.  At this meeting,
Vladimir told him that they need $US700,000.00, and offered two houses and land
in Sydney, Australia for security.  According to Mr. Fedotov, after some
discussion, he agreed.  
<P>

33  	According to Mr. Fedotov's affidavit, this conversation took
place on a Friday.  On the Monday, he withdrew roubles equivalent
to
$US700,000.00 from his bank in cash, and it was placed in a bag.  In oral
evidence, he said the application to withdraw was made
on a Monday, the actual
withdrawal on the Tuesday, and the money placed in two bags.  He said that in
return for the money he obtained
the document, which contained all the
signatures except Vladimir's and his own, and they both then signed the
document.  
<P>

34  	Mr. Fedotov then gave evidence that shortly after arrival in
Australia, Vladimir handed him the title deeds, and they were
kept in a filing
cabinet after that time.  He also gave evidence that he went to Russia in 1998
to find documents relating to the
transaction, but that the relevant bank had
closed.
<P>

35  	It should be recorded that Mr. Fedotov's affidavit was drafted
by the solicitor for all defendants, including Mr. Fedotov,
Mr. Spedding, on
instructions Mr. Spedding obtained from Vladimir.  The draft was sent out to
Mr. Fedotov.  After the draft had been
sent out, Vladimir telephoned Mr.
Spedding to say it was in order.  Mr. Fedotov came to Mr. Spedding with Victor,
who translated
the document into Russian for Mr. Fedotov who then executed it.

<P>

<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

36  	Both sides have provided written outlines of submissions, and I
will not record them in detail.  I will outline matters which
strike me as
being of significance.  
<P>

37  	Mr. Johnson for the plaintiff pointed out that there was no
evidence from any of the D'Jamirze sisters, and made a <u>Jones v. Dunkel</u>
submission.  
<P>

38  	In relation to Mr. Fedotov, he submitted that the circumstances
of the making of the affidavit, his lack of understanding of
what the
proceedings were about, and his denial of any discussions of his evidence
shortly before the hearing, supported the view
that his evidence was prompted
by Vladimir and Victor and was of little weight.  
<P>

39  	Mr. Johnson submitted that the Statements of Affairs and the
solicitors' letters were not satisfactorily explained by the D'Jamirze
brothers, and meant that little weight could be given to their evidence.  
<P>

40  	He submitted that the conversations leading up to the alleged
agreement were unsatisfactorily vague, particularly in relation
to matters such
as interest and the term of the loan.  He pointed to the lack of clarity in the
evidence as to when the document
was signed, particularly by the brothers apart
from Vladimir.  He pointed to conflicts in the evidence concerning the
circumstances
of the agreement and the collection of the money.  He submitted
that the alleged agreement would be a breach of the Deed of about
July 1991.
<P>

41  	He submitted that the agreement was a sham, and referred me to
<u>Sharrment Pty. Limited v. Official Trustee in Bankruptcy</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/179.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 179</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2018%20FCR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 18 FCR
449</a> at 453-8.  
<P>

42  	In relation to the deposit of title deeds, he submitted that the
evidence was insufficient to find an intention to give security
or
authorisation by persons other than Vladimir.  
<P>

43  	For the defendant, Mr. Moore submitted that it had not been put
to the witnesses that the agreement was a sham, nor had alternative
versions of
the events been put to the witnesses.  It was very unlikely that the agreement
had been fraudulently concocted.  Mr.
Fedotov's evidence should be accepted:
his recollection was more concrete than those of Vladimir or Victor.  Even if
all the brothers
were not in Moscow at the relevant time, there had been time
to send the document to Australia to have them sign it before the transaction
was completed.  
<P>

44  	So far as the Statements of Affairs were concerned, they were
not completed with great care and attention, and are not evidence
against Mr.
Fedotov.  As regards the solicitors' letters, the D'Jamirze brothers did not
indicate any appreciation of what "unencumbered"
meant, and it is unlikely that
they gave any thought to the Fedotov mortgage and its effect.  
<P>

<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

45  	As regards credit, I find I can give little weight to the
evidence of the bankrupt D'Jamirze brothers.  They all acted irresponsibly
in
completing their bankruptcy statements.  I considered that Vladimir and Victor
gave evasive evidence in relation to the solicitors'
letters.  These problems
with the evidence of the D'Jamirze brothers do not count positively against Mr.
Fedotov's case, but tend
to remove some of the support which their evidence
might otherwise give to his case.  
<P>

46  	As regards Mr. Fedotov, there is force in the criticism that has
been made of Mr. Fedotov concerning the preparation of the
affidavit, and Mr.
Fedotov as well as his brothers-in-law, has a very strong interest in the
matter.  For reasons I will give, I
consider it highly unlikely that all the
brothers had signed the document by 3rd September 1991, so that I find Mr.
Fedotov's evidence
that all signatures were on the document when he signed it
to be evidence that I cannot accept.  However, otherwise I considered
his
evidence quite circumstantial, and I am inclined to accept the broad substance
of that evidence, if not the details.
<P>

47  	Coming to the circumstances of the Moscow transaction, I accept
that the D'Jamirze brothers were involved in running a substantial
airline, and
incurred a substantial debt to the USSR Air Force, and required a large sum of
money to pay it.  I accept that Vladimir
was in Moscow at the relevant time,
and also Victor, having regard to his recollection of the events of that time
and to the circumstance
that Mr. Fedotov says that he met him at around the
time.  I think it is probable that Alexandre was in Moscow at the relevant
time,
having regard to his passport.  
<P>

48  	As regards the others, I am very doubtful that they were in
Moscow at the time.  Nickolai's passport suggests that he was in
Australia,
although I cannot entirely rule out the possibility that he travelled as crew
on an airline and did not have his passport
stamped.  Mickhail has been ill for
some time, and it seems extremely unlikely that he was in Moscow during the
turbulent events
of August and September 1991.  As far as Alick and Yuri are
concerned, there is no particular reason to think they were in Moscow,
apart
from the evidence of Vladimir and Mr. Fedotov that their signatures were on the
document by the time that they signed the document;
and Alick's evidence of
many discussions about the transaction seems improbable.
<P>

49  	The written document itself carries some weight.  I am not
inclined to think that it was fraudulently prepared later.  The
receipt does
not carry any weight by reason of its terms, because it was admitted only as a
receipt document obtained by Mr. Fedotov.
 Having regard to the turbulent
events then occurring in Moscow, I do not find it implausible that Mr. Fedotov
may have invested
$US700,000.00 in this way without enquiry as to the value or
title to the Australian properties, or clear agreement about interest
or
repayment.
<P>

50  	I do not think the alleged agreement would be a breach of the
July 1991 deed, which relates to <i>sale</i> of interests; but in any event, I
do not think this would significantly affect the probabilities of what
happened, or Mr. Fedotov's
rights.  I am inclined to accept that Vladimir and
Victor signed the document at the time.  As I have said, I am inclined to
accept
the broad substance of Mr. Fedotov's evidence.  However, I am strongly
of the view that Mickhail had not signed the document by 3rd
September:  in my
opinion it is unlikely in the extreme that the document was prepared on the
Friday, sent by plane to Australia
over the weekend, and came back available
for the completion of the transaction on Tuesday.  I am inclined to think that
Nickolai,
Alick and Yuri did not sign it at the time.  I have no strong view as
to whether Alexandre signed it at the time.  I am unable therefore
to accept
Mr. Fedotov's evidence as to what signatures were on the document when he
signed it.  
<P>

51  	In those circumstances, I find on the balance of probabilities
that Mr. Fedotov did advance $US700,000.00 in roubles to enable
Razvitie Russia
to pay money it owed to the USSR Air Force, and that Vladimir and Victor signed
the document in exchange for that
advance.  However, I am not affirmatively
satisfied as to the time when Alick, Yuri or Nickolai signed the document, nor
am I satisfied
that, at any time prior to signing the document, they became
bound by a specifically enforceable agreement to sign such a document.
 In
those circumstances, I find that, subject to other matters to which I will
come, the interests of Vladimir and Victor were charged
by reason of the
transaction, but I am unable to find that the interests of the other three
bankrupts were charged at any time before
they became bankrupt.  
<P>

52  	I do not believe the deposit of title deeds can take the matter
any further.  I accept again the broad substance of Mr. Fedotov's
evidence, but
I am not satisfied by that evidence as to the time of delivery, in particular
whether it occurred prior to 1st February
1994, the date of the last relevant
act of bankruptcy.  There is no evidence of authority, so that it seems to me
that at best, the
deposit could affect the interest only of Vladimir.  
<P>

<b><u>STAMP DUTY</u></b>
<P>

53  	The transaction in this case occurred prior to 1st July 1998, so
that it is subject to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW):  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da199793/" class="autolink_findacts">Duties Act 1997</a>

force at the time when it was first executed,
notwithstanding that the duty
chargeable on such instrument is denoted in terms of the currency provided for

</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   Subsection (1) of this section applies to and in respect of an

(being an

</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   the court is satisfied that the instrument of which it is a copy is

<P>

<b><i>(b)   the copy is duly stamped in accordance with section 73D.

<P>

<P>

54  	It was submitted by Mr. Johnson that, prior to stamping, the
document of 3rd September 1991 had no effect in law or equity
to confer any
title on Mr. Fedotov:  see <u>Ash Street Properties Pty. Ltd. v. Pollnow</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20NSWLR%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 9 NSWLR 80.</a>  Accordingly, prior to stamping, by operation of
Commonwealth legislation (Bankruptcy Act 1996), the beneficial interests of the
bankrupt defendants vested in The Official Trustee, and subsequent stamping was
not effective to divest or otherwise affect The Official
Trustee's title under
that legislation.  
<P>

55  	This submission has some apparent support from statements in
various judgments suggesting that, <i>until</i> an instrument is stamped, it
has no legal effect:  see <u>Dent v. Moore</u> (1919) 26 CLR 316, <u>Eagle Star
Trustees Ltd. v. Taiping Trading Pty. Limited</u> SCNSW, Powell, J., 3/12/90;
<u>Australian Property &amp; Management Pty. Ltd. v. Devefi Pty. Limited</u>
SCNSW, Young, J., 7/4/97; <u>Ash Street Properties</u> per Mahoney, JA at p.82.

<P>

56  	However, all those cases dealt with instruments that had not
been stamped at any time, and they did not need to address the
particular
question of the effect of late stamping.  That question was specifically
addressed and authoritatively determined in <u>Shepherd v. Felt &amp; Textiles
of Australia Pty. Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1931] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2045%20CLR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 45 CLR 359</a>, to the effect that once an
instrument is stamped, it is as efficacious as from execution as if it had
never fallen within the operation
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.29</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a>.  
<P>

57  	The leading judgment on this point is that of Dixon, J, with
whom Starke and McTiernan JJ agreed.  Dealing with an argument
that, at the
time of the breach alleged in that case, the relevant agreement was unstamped
and therefore inefficacious, Dixon, J
said this (at pp.382-3):  
<P>

<b><i>There remains the contention that, conceding the application of sec.27 to
an instrument bearing a sufficient but uncancelled stamp,
and conceding the
payment of the correct amount of "the unpaid duty and the fine payable by law",
nevertheless the document was not
efficacious at the time of the alleged
breach, which therefore could not be wrongful.  This argument depends upon
sec.29 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a>, the material words of which are:  "Except as
aforesaid, no instrument ... shall ... be pleaded or given in evidence, or
admitted
to be good, useful, or available in law or in equity for any purpose
whatsoever, unless it is duly stamped in accordance with the
law in force at
the time when it was first executed".  The words "except as aforesaid" qualify
the whole section, and it is evidence
that whatever is comprised within them is
not vitiated by its provisions.  The words refer to the preceding sections,
including sec.25,
which allows instruments to be stamped after execution and
upon payment of a fine if more than a month has elapsed, and sec.27, which
authorizes the reception in evidence of an instrument although there is some
omission or insufficiency of the stamp thereon, if the
amount of the unpaid
duty and the fine payable by law is paid to the officer of the Court.  Further,
the condition expressed in the
section upon which the usefulness of the
instrument is made to depend is not introduced by the word "until" but by the
word "unless".
 It is not to be pleaded or given in evidence or admitted to be
good, useful or available unless it is duly stamped.  The expressions
"pleaded", "given in evidence", and "admitted" refer to the use or the
recognition of the document or of its operation in judicial
proceedings or
otherwise, and, I think, would naturally be understood as intending that when
by due stamping it had become pleadable,
receivable in evidence and admissible
as good, useful and available, then its validity and operation as from the
beginning were to
be construed as unaffected by the enactment.</i></b>
<P>

The judgments of Rich and Evatt JJ were to somewhat similar effect.  
<P>

58  	Plainly, this means that an unstamped instrument is not of
absolutely no effect <i>until</i> stamped:  the use of the word "until" in some
of the cases noted earlier is obiter, and contrary to the ratio of
<u>Shepherd</u>.  Until stamped, an instrument has whatever effect is
consistent with the proposition that, <i>if</i> stamped, it will be fully
effective <i>ab initio</i>.  To put this another way, <u>Shepherd</u> must mean
that an instrument is effective from the start conditionally upon being stamped
before relied on in court, or alternatively,
from the start carries the
potentiality of being so effective.  
<P>

59  	This approach is confirmed by the express disapproval in
<u>Shepherd</u> of the case of <u>Wagga Finance Co. v. Lever</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1929/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] NSWStRp 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2030%20SR%28NSW%29%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 30
SR(NSW) 76.</a>  In that case, it had been held that the tort of detinue was not
committed by a refusal of a demand for goods made by a person whose
title
depended on an unstamped instrument.  The disapproval of that case must mean
that it was decided in <u>Shepherd</u> that the unstamped instrument was, at
the time of the demand, sufficient to make refusal of the demand detinue,
provided that the
instrument was stamped before being relied on in court.  
<P>

60  	This general approach is also confirmed by <u>In Re Delny
Fodders</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%204%20SASR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 4 SASR 538</a>; <u>Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Limited v.
Love</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20133%20CLR%20459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 133 CLR 459</a>; and <u>Re Douglas; Ex Part Starkey</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2075%20ALR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 75
ALR 97.</a>  In the last case, a bill of sale had been executed in August 1986, and
stamped in December 1986.  The assignor executed a Deed of
Assignment under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> in March 1987.  The trustee sought to set aside the bill of sale
as a preference given within six months before the execution of
the Deed of
Assignment, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.122</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>.  Pincus, J held that,
once stamped, the bill of sale was effective from August 1986, more than six
months before execution of the
deed of assignment.  
<P>

61  	In my opinion, it follows that, when Vladimir and Victor became
bankrupt, their interest in the properties passed to The Official
Trustee,
subject to the mortgage to Mr. Fedotov which was effective conditionally upon
being stamped, or alternatively subject to
the potentiality of this mortgage
becoming effective from its date in the event of its being stamped.
Accordingly, upon the instrument
being stamped, the condition was satisfied
and/or the potentiality became an actuality.  This did not involve the
divesting of an
interest already vested in The Official Trustee, but merely the
removal of a condition from a limitation on that interest.  
<P>

<b><u>YURI'S INTEREST AND ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS</u></b>
<P>

62  	In circumstances where I am not satisfied when Yuri executed the
document, it is not necessary for me to decide this issue.
 
<P>

63  	However, I will note Mr. Moore's submission that, assuming Yuri
executed the agreement on or about 3rd September 1991, Mr.
Fedotov is entitled
to the benefit of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s123.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.123</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>, the effect of which is that
nothing in the Act invalidates the mortgage if Mr. Fedotov can establish the
matters in s.123(1)(e),(f)
and (g).  Those matters are as follows:  (e) that
the transaction took place before the day on which the debtor became a
bankrupt;
(f) that the person did not, at the time of the transaction, have
notice of the presentation of a petition against the debtor; and
(g) that the
transaction was in good faith and in the ordinary course of business.  
<P>

64  	Mr. Moore submitted that the only questionable matter in this
case concerned "ordinary course of business", and in relation
to that the test
was that laid down in <u>Robertson v. Grigg</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1932/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%2047%20CLR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 47 CLR 257</a>, per
Gavan-Duffy, CJ and Starke, J (at p.267):  
<P>

<b><i>Therefore, the test under s.95 of the ordinary course of business is not
whether the act is unusual or common in the business of the
debtor or of the
creditor, but whether it is "a fair transaction, and what a man might do
without having any bankruptcy in view".</i></b>
<P>

Mr. Moore relied on the approval of that approach in <u>Burns v. McFarlane</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1940/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2064%20CLR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 64 CLR 108</a> and <u>Harkness v. Partnership Pacific Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41
NSWLR 204.</a>  
<P>

65  	However, <u>Robertson</u> was dealing with a preference case,
and the focus on what a person might do without having bankruptcy in view is
appropriate in such
cases.  There are other statements in even the cases relied
on by Mr. Moore to the effect that, for a transaction to be in the ordinary
course of business, it must be an "ordinary business transaction".  The
transaction in this case does not appear to be the sort of
transaction which
would be undertaken with the bankruptcy of the D'Jamirze brothers in view; but
the whole circumstances of the transaction
are so extraordinary that I would
not be prepared to find that it is a transaction in the ordinary course of
business.  
<P>

<b><u>DEPOSIT OF TITLE DEEDS</u></b>
<P>

66  	It does appear that a deposit of title deeds by an owner with
his creditor for the purpose of securing an antecedent debt will
operate as an
equitable charge:  see Coote <u>On Mortgages</u>, 9th Ed., 1927, Vol.1, p.86;
<u>Re Wallis &amp; Simmonds (Builders) Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%201%20WLR%20391" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 1 WLR 391</a> at 395;
<u>Westpac Banking Corporation v. Cronin</u> (1990) 6 BPR 13,105.  
<P>

67  	However, I have already indicated that I am not satisfied that
the deposit occurred prior to the last of the relevant acts
of bankruptcy.
Being unsatisfied as to the time of the deposit and the circumstances, and
having regard to its relationship to a
transaction which I do not consider was
in the ordinary course of business, I would not be satisfied that the deposit
itself was
a transaction in the ordinary course of business.  Furthermore, I am
not satisfied that the deposit by Vladimir had the authority
of the other
D'Jamirze brothers.  In those circumstances, the deposit of title deeds cannot
take the matter any further.  
<P>

<b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

68  	It follows that The Official Trustee is entitled to the
interests of Alick, Yuri and Nickolai in the properties unaffected
by any
mortgage or charge to Mr. Fedotov; and to the interests of Vladimir and Victor
subject to a mortgage or charge in favour of
Mr. Fedotov to secure the
equivalent of $US700,000.00.  
<P>

69  	As submitted by Mr. Moore, I accept that the bankruptcies of the
five bankrupt defendants severed the joint tenancy, with the
result that The
Official Trustee became entitled to five-elevenths of the two properties as a
tenant in common with the six non-bankrupt
defendants, who held the remaining
six-elevenths interest as joint tenants inter se.  As a result of the death of
Valentina, the
six-elevenths interest is now held by the five surviving
non-bankrupt defendants as joint tenants.  
<P>

70  	It follows that The Official Trustee is entitled to the
appointment of trustees for sale.  Upon sale, the net proceeds would
be
divided, as to three-elevenths to The Official Trustee, as to two-elevenths to
Mr. Fedotov, and as to the remaining six-elevenths
to the five surviving
non-bankrupt defendants.  At present, I do not see any necessity to have the
interest of The Official Trustee
or Mr. Fedotov registered.
<P>

71  	My tentative view on costs is that The Official Trustee can
satisfy his costs from his three-elevenths share, Mr. Fedotov can
satisfy his
costs from his two-elevenths share, and the five non-bankrupt defendants should
bear their own costs.  The five bankrupt
defendants would be liable to pay
costs, but it appears there would be little point in making any such order.
