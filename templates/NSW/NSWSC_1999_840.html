<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 22 March 1999 the third
defendant seeks that the statement of claim be set aside as against him
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66zg.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66ZG</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW)</b> or alternatively
that the statement of claim be dismissed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> r 5 of the
<b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  The plaintiff did not rely on any affidavit
evidence.  The third defendant relied on his affidavit sworn 12 June 1998, the
affidavit
of Robert Yong Cong Huang and that of the first and second
defendants' solicitor Ross Anthony Golotta sworn 17 June 1998.
<P>

2  	By statement of claim filed 26 February 1999, the plaintiff
pleads that he is a real estate entrepreneur and developer.  The
first and
second defendants John Bova and Paul Bova respectively have been at all
relevant times the owners of the property known
as 19B George Street Burwood
being Lot 1 DP321365 folio identifier No 1/321365 (the property).  The third
defendant Robert Huang
is an accountant and a real estate developer.  
<P>

3  	The first and second defendants throughout the period April and
May 1998 represented to the plaintiff that upon the plaintiff
executing an
option agreement (the option) and making payment in accordance with the terms
of the option that the first and second
defendants would enter into an option
in the same terms with the plaintiff.  It is alleged against the first and
second defendant
that they were in breach of a contract and that they engaged
in false and misleading conduct. On 21 July 1998 Justice Young noted
that the
plaintiff is no longer seeking specific performance.
<P>

4  	Paragraph (12) of the statement of claim refers to the third
defendant.  It alleges that the third defendant knew that the option
had been
entered into by the plaintiff wrongfully and with intent to injure the
plaintiff procured and induced the first and second
defendants to break their
respective agreements with the plaintiff and to refuse to perform or to further
perform.  The plaintiff
claims that as a consequence he lost the benefit of the
option and lost the profit that he would otherwise have made and has been
greatly injured in his business and has been put to considerable trouble,
inconvenience and expense and has thereby suffered loss
and damage.
<P>

5  	For the purposes of this application, I find the following
facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff attended his solicitor Mr Fredericks and executed the option
agreement as between the plaintiff on the one part
and the first and second
defendants on the other.  
<P>

(2)	Arrangements were made for exchange to take place on 8 May 1998 at 9.30 am
at Mr Golotta's office (the solicitor for the first
and second defendants).
<P>

(3)	On 8 May 1998 the plaintiff went directly to Mr Golotta's office and was
told by his secretary that Mr Golotta was not available.
 The plaintiff asked
if the first and second defendants were in attendance.  He was informed that
they would be arriving a little
later.  
<P>

(4)	Mr Golotta's secretary told the plaintiff to leave the documents with her
and she would get the first and second defendants
to sign them.  
<P>

(5)	While the plaintiff was present in the solicitor's office the first
defendant telephoned.  The plaintiff a heard a response
from the secretary
saying "Yes, Mr Elias is here personally.  He has paid us the cheque and
everything is okay.  We will see you
soon." Mr Golotta, in his affidavit
confirms that on 8 May 1998 an option signed by the plaintiff and a cheque in
the sum of $10,000
was delivered to his office.  
<P>

(6)	A receipt of payment was handed to the plaintiff.  The secretary assured
him that she would get the documents signed and sent
to his solicitor.
<P>

(7)	On 10 May 1998 John Bova signed a deed on his behalf and on behalf of his
brother Paul Bova with Mr Huang in which they as vendors
agreed to sell the
property to Mr Huang as purchaser for the sum $700,000.  Mr John Bova received
a cheque for $10,000 from Mr Huang
in accordance with paragraph (2) of that
deed.
<P>

(8)	On 11 May 1998 Mr Golotta received a fax from the plaintiff's solicitor
asking when he would be in a position to exchange the
option agreement.  
<P>

(9)	On 11 May 1998 the first and second defendants attended Mr Golotta's office
and signed their copy of the option preparatory
to an exchange.  
<P>

(10)	On 11 May 1998 Robert Pignataro telephoned the plaintiff and said
"Congratulations, the documents have been executed."
<P>

6  	In relation to summary judgment Part 13 r 5 of the <b>Supreme
Court Rules</b> provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to
the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for
relief in the
proceedings -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious;</b>
<P>

<b>	or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or
in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings."</b>
<P>

7  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to remind
himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway
Commissioners</u></b> (1948-49)78 CLR 62, <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways</u> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> and <b><u>Webster &amp;
Anor v Lampard</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  I have reproduced some of the
passages quoted.
<P>

8  	In <b><u>General Steel</u></b> Barwick CJ, who heard the
application alone, referred to Dixon J's passage quoted above at p 130.  He
then stated:
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

9  	Barwick CJ also said:
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense."</b>
<P>

10  	More recently in <b><u>Webster &amp; Anor v Lampard</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598</a> Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ reinforced the rigorous
testing stating, at p 602:
<P>

<b>"The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with `exceptional
caution' and `should never be exercised unless it is clear
that there is no
real question to be tried."'</b>
<P>

11  	According to Rolfe AJA in <b><u>Zarb:</u></b>
<P>

<b>"The demanding nature of the test is in no way lessened in circumstances
where there are the potential for difficult factual and legal
issues to arise.
Rather, as the decision in Webster made clear, it is heightened:  see also
Wickstead &amp; Ors v Browne  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1</a> and Esanda Finance Corporation
Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241."</a></b>
<P>

12  	The third defendant submitted that the statement of claim should
be dismissed because firstly, the option agreement is void
pursuant to s 66ZG
of the Act because there was no exchange of counterparts, one of which had to
be signed by the purchaser and the
other had to be signed by the vendor and
secondly, on the undisputed facts, the plaintiff had not exchanged a contract
with the first
and second defendants, so tort of interference with a contract
does not arise and therefore there is no cause of action.  The plaintiff
submitted that firstly it is unclear what the word "exchange" means in s 66ZG
of the Act;  secondly, the parties agreed to a methodology
for exchange to take
place and thirdly, the law is developing so that the tort of interference with
a contract may extend to cover
a "non formulated contract".
<P>

13  	I turn to section 66ZG of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></b> which
provides:
<P>

<b>"Option void in certain circumstances</b>
<P>

<b>  (1)	An option granted for the purchase of residential property is
void:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	unless it is granted by way of exchange of counterparts, one of which is
signed by the purchaser and the other signed by the vendor,
or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	if it is exercisable within 42 days after it is granted or, if a
different period is prescribed, within that period.</b>
<P>

<b>  (1A) Subsection (1) (a) does not render an option void if it was granted,
without an exchange of counterparts, before the commencement
of the amendment
made to this section by the Conveyancing Amendment Act 1997 and it was signed
in duplicate by both parties.</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	If an option is void under this section, section 66ZE applies as if an
effective notice of rescission of the option had been
served under this
Division, except that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the purchaser is not liable to the forfeiture provided for under that
section, and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	that section has effect as if it provided that the whole of the
consideration paid in relation to the option and the whole of
any deposit paid
in relation to the purchase of the property are payable to the
purchaser."</b>
<P>

14  	In relation to the exchange of contract, the parties referred to
<b><u>Eccles v Bryan</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%201%20Ch%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 1 Ch 93</a> <b><u>Domb &amp; Anor v
Isoz</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%201%20Ch%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 1 Ch 548</a> and <b><u>Sindel v Georgiou</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154
CLR 661.</a>  In <b><u>Eccles</u></b>, it was decided that an exchange occurred
when there was a meeting of solicitors in the office of one of them (usually
the vendor's
office) and two signed engrossments were physically passed between
them so the purchaser had possession of a copy signed by the vendor
and the
vendor had a copy signed by the purchaser.  The exchange is the crucial and
vital fact which brings the contract into existence.
 Without exchange, there
is no contract.  Lord Greene also discussed exchange by post.
<P>

15  	In <b><u>Domb</u></b> it was held that exchange by telephone can
only take place after both vendor and purchaser sign contracts in identical
form (subject
to the question of rectification, which can apply to any
contract) so that there is no doubt about the terms of the contract.  Exchange
by telephone can only take place when a contract signed by a client is in the
physical possession of his own solicitor or in the
possession of the solicitor
on the other side who agreed to hold that part to the order of the despatching
solicitor.
<P>

16  	In <b><u>Sindel</u></b>, the High Court cited
<b><u>Eccles</u></b> as authority for exchange by post and <b><u>Domb</u></b>
as authority for constructive exchange by telephone.  The issue in
<b><u>Sindel</u></b> was whether the parties were bound by the exchange of
non-identical counterparts of a contract.  In <b><u>Sindel</u></b> the High
Court looked at the intention of the parties intended to be bound by the
exchange of non-identical counterparts.
<P>

17  	From the facts as previously stated, on 8 May 1998 the plaintiff
executed his counterpart of the option agreement.  On 10 May
1998, the first
and second defendants entered into an agreement for sale with the third
defendant for the same property.  Three days
later on 11 May 1998, the first
and second defendants signed their counterpart of the option agreement.  The
only evidence that related
to an exchange occurring is where Mr Pignataro the
agent of the plaintiff, telephoned the plaintiff to say "congratulations the
documents
have been exchanged" although it is not clear the source of his
knowledge.  The solicitor for the first and second defendants refers
to the
first and second defendants signing the option preparatory to exchange.  
<P>

18  	At trial, both Mr Pignataro and Mr Golotta would give evidence
and be cross examined on the issue as to whether there had been
an exchange of
contracts.  The plaintiff's argument that the option agreement had been
exchanged is a weak one.  However the statement
of claim should not be struck
out as I cannot conclude that the plaintiff's case is hopeless particularly
where there may be disputed
evidence on the issue as to whether an exchange
occurred.  For these reasons I am of the view that the statement of claim
should
not be struck out on the basis that it is void under s 66ZG of the
Act.
<P>

19  	In relation to the plaintiff's submission that the parties
agreed on a methodology for exchange to take place, the plaintiff's
evidence at
its highest is that Mr Golotta's secretary told the plaintiff to leave the
documents and she would get the first and
second defendants to sign them.
While she may have said that she would arrange for the signing of the contract,
there is no evidence
that she made any arrangement for the exchange of the
counterparts.  This proposition is hopeless.
<P>

20  	In relation to the plaintiff's third submission concerning the
development of the tort, the plaintiff referred to two cases
namely <b><u>The
Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Lorenz &amp; Ors</u></b> Knights Industrial
Reports Vol II October 1971 to March 1972 at p 72 and a Canadian Court of
Appeal decision of <b><u>Gersham v Manitoba Vegetable Producers' Marketing
Board</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20DLR%20%283d%29%201977" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 DLR (3d) 1977</a> at p 114.
<P>

21  	In summary judgment applications where the law is ripe for
development, Master Allen (as he then was) in <b><u>Contribution Fund of
Australia v Hunt</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2044%20ALR%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 44 ALR 365</a> at pp 373-374  said:
<P>

<b> "...It is not by any means rare in the history of the development of the
common law that a high appellate court, in enunciating a
novel development in
the law, albeit one avowedly based on a miscellany of old cases, has chosen to
use general words of imprecise
limits in meaning to facilitate the arrival, in
later cases, of the final form of the development without the need to overrule
what
earlier had been stated.  That being so I am of opinion that a court at
first instance should be particularly astute not to risk
stifling that
development of the law by summarily throwing out of court actions in respect of
which there is a reasonable possibility
that it will be found, in the
development of the law, still embryonic, that a cause of action does lie.  The
risk of injustice to
the plaintiff, which summary termination of his claim
would entail, is real.  One cannot predict, with firm assurance, what the
future
holds as the final formulation of the new development."</b>
<P>

22  	This passage was quoted with approval by Justice Badgery-Parker
in <b><u>Gibson v Parkes District Hospital</u></b> (1991-92) 26 NSWLR p 9 at
35.
<P>

23  	It is difficult to conceive that there can be an interference
with contractual relation if there is no contract in existence.
 The
plaintiff's case is that the option agreement was exchanged on 11 May 1998 yet
the third defendant alleged interference ended
on 10 May 1998 when he entered
into a contract for the purchase of the same property with the first and second
defendants.
<P>

24  	In relation to the tort of interference with contractual
relations, the plaintiff referred to <b><u>Torquay Hotel Co Ltd v
Cousins</u></b> (1969) 2 Ch 106.  In <b><u>Cousins</u></b>, Lord Denning MR
stated that there were three elements of the tort.  They are:
<P>

  (i)	There must be interference in the execution of an existing contract.  The
interference is not confined to the procurement
of a breach of contract.  It
extends to a case where a third person prevents or hinders one party from
performing his contract, even
though it be not a breach.
<P>

 (ii)	The interference must be deliberate.  The person must know of the
contract or, at any rate, turn a blind eye to it and intend
to interfere with
it - see <b><u>Emerald Constructions Co v Lowthian</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20WLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 WLR 691.</a>
<P>

(iii)	The interference must be direct.
<P>

25  	The torts major role has been in area of trade rivalry and
labour relations but now applies to all kinds of contractual relations
including commercial contracts.
<P>

26  	<b><u>Lorenz</u></b> concerned industrial action taken by a
union.  The plaintiff was a well known insurance company who employed over
11,000 agents to
collect premiums from policy holders.  Every district agent
entered into a service agreement with the plaintiff regulating his or
her
duties.  One of those duties was to account for the premiums which he collected
and remit them to the plaintiff.  The union sent
a circular letter which
instructed the agents to bank the moneys but not to remit them to the
plaintiff.  There was no issue in this
case as to whether the plaintiff and the
district agents had a "non formulated" contract.  The plaintiff's agents had
signed service
agreements in place.  The decision of <b><u>Lorenz</u></b> does
not reflect a development in the law that would assist the plaintiff's case.
<P>

27  	In <b><u>Gersham</u></b> the facts are that the plaintiff went
to work for the Stella Company (the company) for $250 per week with an
understanding that he
would become a part owner through the purchase of the
shares at a price which had not been fully settled at the time of the
defendants
interference.  The plaintiff has a contract of employment with the
company.
<P>

28  	The learned trial judge found on evidence that the action of the
defendant board forced the Stella company to discharge the
plaintiff without
adequate notice and forced the cancellation of the proven arrangement they had
regarding selling shares to the
plaintiff.  The trial judge followed the
principles set out in <b><u>Lumley v Gye</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/1853/J73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1853] EngR 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1843%2d60%5d%20All%20ER%20208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1843-60] All ER Rep 208</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20E%20%26%20B%20216" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 El
&amp; BL 216</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=116%20ER%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">116 ER 749.</a>  In doing so he said  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=65%20DLR%20%283d%29%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[65 DLR (3d) 181</a> at p 189  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20WLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976]
2 WLR 432]</a> that the tort of interfering in contractual relationships covers not
only interference but also interference with an existing contractual
relationship but also interference where "there was an agreement to enter into
a contract".
<P>

29  	The Court of Appeal said that the trial judge's language
suggested that the tort of unlawfully interfering in contractual relationships
extends to interference with the formation of such relationships.  The Court of
Appeal held that it might have been error, if the
learned trial judge had
asserted as a general proposition that the tort of unlawfully interfering in
contractual relationship extends
to interference with the formation of such
relationship.  But the language of the learned judge was geared to the factual
situation
confronting him and must be so appraised.  The Court of Appeal
stated:
<P>

<b>"on the evidence in this case, there was one relationship with Stella and
its shareholders.  Here a contractual relationship already
existed in respect
of the employment.  An incident or aspect of that relationship was the
likelihood or prospect of the plaintiff
acquiring a share interest in the
company.  What the plaintiff lost by the defendant's wrongful interference was
not the opportunity
for the formation of a contract but rather the opportunity
to extend his already existing contractual relationship of employment
into one
that would include acquisition of shares.  Into that respect this case from
<i>Allen v Flood et al</i>.  and the<i> Crofter's case,</i> supra.  The case
before us is, therefore, not one in which it is necessary to hold that a
defendant is liable for interfering with
an agreement to agree."</b>
<P>

30  	Thus the plaintiff loss by the defendant's wrongful inference
was not the opportunity for the formation of a contract but rather
the
opportunity to extend an already existing contractual relationship.
<P>

31  	In the case before me there is nothing to suggest that the
plaintiff already had an existing contractual relationship with
the first and
second defendants.  Hence the opportunity to extend his already existing
contractual relationship does not arise. 
This case does not assist the
plaintiff's submission that the case law is developing to cover "non formulated
contracts".
<P>

32  	It is my view that the plaintiff's case as currently pleaded
does not establish the cause of action and should be dismissed.
 However in the
exercise of my discretion the third defendant should be given a further
opportunity to replead his case.  The current
statement of claim should be
struck out as against the third defendant.  Costs should follow the event.  An
amended statement of
claim which repleads a cause of action or causes of action
is to be filed and served within 21 days.  The plaintiff should pay the
costs
of the motion.
<P>

33  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The statement of claim is struck out as against the third defendant.
<P>

(2)	An amended statement of claim which repleads a cause of action or causes of
action against the third defendant is to be filed
and served within 21 days.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff is to pay the third defendant's costs of the notice of motion
filed 22 March 1999.
