<P>

Plaintiffs
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>21 June 1999</b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	The present application is a novel one. It is by the two
Administrators under a Deed of Company Arrangement ("DCA") who were
previously
administrators of the Company Spargold Enterprises Pty Limited which is and
remains hopelessly insolvent.  The Deed Administrators
are concerned that
significant indebtedness has been incurred since the company was put under a
DCA. It is contended that an administrator
of a DCA has a fiduciary
responsibility in relation to such creditors as well as to other creditors to
act impartially. They apply
to terminate the DCA because otherwise there will
be a distribution pursuant to the DCA, leaving nothing for the post DCA
creditors.
The company would then be ordered to pass into liquidation under the
two former administrators.
<P>

<b>ELABORATION</b>
<P>

2   	The consequence of not making such an order is brought out
by Mr Fordyce in his comprehensive written submissions to which
I express my
indebtedness. Thus if a distribution were  made under the DCA, the immediate
effect would be that creditors covered
by the Deed would be paid their
dividend, whilst creditors whose debts were incurred after the DCA would be
paid nothing. It also
is inevitable that, with the company being hopelessly
insolvent, some creditor will seek then to wind up the company.
<P>

3   	At that point, it was said that an application would likely
be made to retrieve the amount paid under the DCA on the basis
that it was
either an uncommercial transaction or an unfair preference, each within the
meaning of Pt 5.7B of the <i>Corporations Law</i>. However, such an attack
would be defeated by the fact that, in relation to such "insolvent
transactions", avoidance only applies
if they were entered into (or given
effect to) on or before the winding-up began (s588FE(2)) and in the case of an
administration
that is taken to be the date the administration commenced (s513B
and s513C). Nonetheless an attack might well be made on the basis
that the
distribution involved acting contrary to the interests of one group of
creditors in a discriminatory fashion, not justified
in the interests of
creditors and the company as a whole, where the company is insolvent and not
expected thereafter to survive.
See generally <i>Walker v Wimborne</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20137%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976)
137 CLR 1</a>, though otherwise it has been suggested that the duty may be one of
imperfect obligation owed to creditors exigible merely by way
of a
qualification on the shareholders' power to ratify; <i>Sycotex Pty Ltd v
Baseler</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1117.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1117</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20122%20ALR%20531" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 122 ALR 531</a> per Gummow J.
<P>

4   	It will be appreciated that the validating effect of
s451C(a) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> does not apply to transactions by a
Deed Administrator but only by an ordinary administrator so that it would
afford no protection
in such a subsequent liquidation.
<P>

5   	That squarely poses the question, does a Deed Administrator
have a duty cognate with that of a liquidator to act impartially
as between pre
and post DCA creditors, being for that purpose at least in a fiduciary or
quasi-fiduciary position though concededly
not as a trustee as I explain below.
There appears to be no authority precisely on point though some helpful analogy
as well as support
for that proposition implicitly to be found in s447E(1) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. This provides in relation to an administrator
including one under a DCA:
<P>

<b>"447E(1)  [Power where management prejudicial to creditors]</b>  Where the
Court is satisfied that the administrator of a company under administration, or
of a deed of company arrangement:
<P>

(a)	has managed, or is managing, the company's business, property or affairs in
a way that is prejudicial to the interests of some
or all of the company's
creditors or members; or
<P>

(b)	has done an act, or made an omission, or proposes to do an act, or to make
an omission, that is or would be prejudicial to such
interests;
<P>

the Court may make such order as it thinks just."
<P>

6   	There is nothing in that subsection to suggest that the
Court would only intervene where there is prejudice to pre DCA creditors
and
would not intervene where the prejudice is to post DCA creditors. To the
contrary, if as appears "creditors" include both categories,
it would be
surprising indeed that the court has this statutory power to intervene by
reason of prejudice (here) to post DCA creditors
yet the administrator would
have no duty of impartiality towards them but rather a duty owed exclusively to
pre DCA creditors; a
duty leading the DCA administrator to distribute only to
them, leaving post DCA creditors lamenting.
<P>

7   	Drawing on the analogy of a voluntary liquidator, which I
consider is apposite also to a DCA Administrator, a voluntary liquidator
has a
duty to act impartially as between creditors. Thus Roxburgh J in <i>Re Britton
&amp; Millard Ltd</i> (1957) 107 LJO 601 at 601. 
<P>

"... this was an unusual case for the voluntary liquidator had come here to
take sides. It was most undesirable for a voluntary
liquidator to interfere in
proceedings such as these except to dispel any ground for attack which may be
made on him. The mere fact
that a voluntary liquidator opposed a winding-up by
the Court was one reason why a compulsory winding up order should be made
because
liquidator must be impartial as between the creditors."
<P>

Such a voluntary liquidator is not a trustee but is in a fiduciary position.
See for example <i>Thomas Franklin &amp; Sons Ltd v Cameron</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1935/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] NSWStRp 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2036%20SR%28NSW%29%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 36
SR(NSW) 286</a> at 296 where Davidson J in the full court reviewed the authorities
concerning the position of a liquidator in a voluntary winding
up and concluded
that he was not a trustee but did have fiduciary duties:
<P>

"It appears to me then, on the whole, from all these authorities, that the
liquidator is principally and really an agent for the
company but occupies a
position which is fiduciary in some respects and is bound by the statutory
duties imposed upon him by the
Act."
<P>

8   	Also to the point is that those post DCA creditors whose
provision of credit has presumably allowed the company to continue
to trade for
the benefit of the pre DCA creditors should not be left to incur additional
expense in funding such a challenge. No-one
will in future trade with a company
under a DCA if that were the result, thus preventing salvage of such companies.
Such a challenge,
if so forced on post DCA creditors, would be to recapture
money that the Court, if aware of the situation, would most likely have
prevented from being distributed, by ordering to the contrary under s447E.
Terminating the DCA will of course prevent such distribution
and there is no
further point to the DCA, nor need for order under s447E.
<P>

9   	The only other issue is whether under s445D, an order
terminating the deed could be made on the application of the DCA administrator,
on the basis that that administrator comes within sub-para (c) of s445D(2) as
"any other interested person". Clearly paras (a) and
(b) permit such an
application by a creditor or the company. Here I should add the Company
supports the application of the DCA administrator
but has no funds to make the
application itself.
<P>

10   	I am satisfied that were the matter to have come to me as
an application under s447E of the <i>Corporations Law</i> to restrain the
distribution, I would have so ordered.
<P>

11   	That would indubitably have made the DCA administrator an
interested person able to apply for termination of the Deed to avoid
that
outcome. It should follow where such an order would have been made, but for the
application to terminate the Deed, that the
DCA administrator is no less a
person interested. It is thus capable of making the application.
<P>

12   	It follows that I am satisfied that:
<P>

(i)	the DCA administrator owes a duty of impartiality to all creditors pre and
post DCA, 
<P>

(ii)	to permit the distribution under the DCA would unfairly prejudice post DCA
creditors,
<P>

(iii)	this would be in circumstances where the incurrence of such debt by a non
DCA administrator would have led to the administrator
being liable for the debt
but be covered by the indemnity in favour of such an administrator so as to
give priority to that indemnity
claim (see ss443A, D and E), and
<P>

(iv)	the consequence of the foregoing and where the DCA has no further purpose,
is that the proper course is to terminate the DCA
on the application of the
Deed Administrators so as to prevent that distribution and have the Company
wound up and the Deed Administrators
appointed its Liquidators.
<P>

13   	However, as the pre DCA creditors have not been formally
notified of this application, I consider the appropriate course to
make any
orders operative only after a reasonable period and for the DCA Administrators
formally to notify those creditors as well
as post DCA creditors to give any of
these the opportunity, if they wish, in the meantime to put any submissions to
the Court either
in person or in writing prior to the matter coming back before
me at 10 am in the Company List on 12 July 1999.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

14   	Accordingly I make the following orders which will come
into effect on the expiration of 12 July 1999 subject to further order:
<P>

1.	I order in terms of paragraph 1 of the Summons of 17 June 1999 pursuant to
s445D(1)(g) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> and pursuant to all other powers
thereunto enabling that the Deed of Company Arrangement applicable to Spargold
Enterprises Pty Limited
be terminated and the company be wound up and the Deed
Administrators appointed its Liquidators, such order not to come into effect
until the expiry of 12 July 1999 after all creditors have been notified of the
application and this judgment and have had the opportunity
to put any
submissions.
<P>

2.	I advise that the Deed Administrators were justified in making the
application contained in the Summons.
