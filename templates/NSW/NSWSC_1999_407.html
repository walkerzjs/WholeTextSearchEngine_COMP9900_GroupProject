<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

<center><b>I  INTRODUCTION</b></center>
<P>

1	National Roads Association of New South Wales ("Association") was
incorporated in 1920 as a company limited by guarantee.  It
was formed to
promote the interests of motorists and other road users and to provide services
to motorists, including an emergency
or breakdown road service and insurance.
With some intermediate changes of name involving expansion to National Roads
and Motorists'
Association and use of the acronym NRMA, on 17 November
1992 its name was changed to NRMA Ltd.  By 1994 Association had over 1,800,000
members, it wholly owned or was the majority shareholder in eight subsidiary
companies, and it had assets of approximately $457 million
under its
management.
<P>

2	NRMA Insurance Ltd ("Insurance") was incorporated in 1926, also as a company
limited by guarantee.  It was formed to provide insurance
and financial
services, without restriction to a motoring connection.  Policy holders and
recipients of financial services did not
have to be members of Insurance:  the
members of Insurance were Association, any director of Insurance appointed by
Association,
and (in general terms) those policy holders who were also members
of Association.  By 1994 Insurance had approximately 1,300,000
members, it
wholly owned or was the majority shareholder in eight subsidiary companies, and
it had assets of approximately $4,401,000,000
under its management.
<P>

3	Association, Insurance, and their subsidiaries operated as an organisation
generally known to the public as the NRMA, and where
there is no point in
distinguishing between the constituents of the organisation I will so refer to
it.  Association was the dominant
constituent of the organisation.  The
directors of Association appointed the directors of Insurance, and the
President of Association
was ex officio the chairman of directors of Insurance.
The articles of Association provided for the management of its affairs to
be
carried on by a Board of Management comprised of the President, the chief
executive officer, and others elected by the directors
being either directors
or employees, with a majority of directors.  The articles of Insurance provided
for appointment by the directors
of Association of members of the Board of
Management as a committee to act <i>"in liaison with"</i>  the directors of
Insurance, and that the directors of Insurance might delegate their powers to
the committee.  These bodies were
put in place, it seems with common
membership, and acted jointly as the Board of Management and Insurance Liaison
Committee.  So
the affairs of Association and Insurance received significantly
common direction, but in practice with Association able to exercise
overall
control.
<P>

4	As is evident, the NRMA was successful and prosperous.  It built up large
reserves.  Its success and prosperity did not mean the
distribution of its
profits.  As companies limited by guarantee, Association and Insurance were
operated for the mutual benefit of
members.  Profits could, and did, mean that
the annual subscription for the provision of road service by Association was
kept down,
that other services were provided by Association to members at less
than cost, and (for a time) that rebates were given to the holders
of policies
issued by Insurance.  But the members were not shareholders, and as the
articles stood could not receive dividends; 
on a winding-up of Insurance any
surplus went to Association, and if Association were then wound up any surplus
went not to members
but to an institution with similar objects or for
charitable purposes.  
<P>

5	For this reason, amongst others, the senior management and a majority of
directors of the NRMA did not regard its structure as
satisfactory, the other
reasons including what was regarded as an unsatisfactory basis for corporate
governance and a perceived need
to be able to raise capital in order to compete
effectively and expand in the NRMA's commercial activities.  So it was proposed
that
the NRMA be restructured by what was called "demutualisation", that is, a
change from operation through companies limited by guarantee
conducted for the
mutual benefit of members to operation through a company with shareholders
conducted with a view to making profits
and distributing them to the
shareholders.  The proposal was described in a letter from the President to
members, in the prospectus
of which much will be said later in these reasons,
as a proposal to "unlock the wealth" of the NRMA and "permit members to share
in [its] wealth and future financial successes".  The slogan "Share the Future"
was adopted in connection with the proposal.
<P>

6	Consideration of restructuring began in 1992.  The proposal was approved by
the boards of Association and Insurance for further
development with a view to
ultimate listing of the NRMA on the Stock Exchange, and was announced, on
17 March 1994.  Neither the
new structure nor the steps to achieve it were
finally determined at that time, although it was envisaged that a new company
with
share capital would be incorporated, that the new company would be
admitted to membership of Association and Insurance, that resolutions
would be
passed at general meetings of members of Association and Insurance having the
effect that the members of Association and
Insurance other than the new company
would cease to be members and would instead either become shareholders in the
new company or
receive a cash payment, and that the new company would then be
listed on the Stock Exchange.  In the result, the new company would
be a listed
holding company, the only member of Association and Insurance, and services
previously enjoyed by virtue of membership
(road service and otherwise) would
be provided to the now shareholders in the new company under contracts with the
service provider.
 
<P>

7	Development of the proposal continued after 17 March 1994.  The new structure
and the steps to achieve it were finally determined,
still of the same nature.
The new company NRMA Holdings Ltd ("Holdings") was incorporated (some of the
directors of Association became
its directors), and Holdings became a member of
Association and Insurance.  On 18 August 1994 the boards of Association
and Insurance
formally resolved to proceed with the proposal by putting it to
general meetings of their members with their recommendations.
<P>

8	The crucial step in the proposal was the passing of the resolutions at the
general meetings.  Special resolutions of 75 per cent
of those present, in
person or by proxy, were required.  It was necessary that notices of the
general meetings be sent to members
and that they be appropriately informed as
to the proposal so that they could vote on the resolutions, and as well the
offer of shares
in Holdings to those members (and others) who chose to become
shareholders called for the issue of a prospectus.  Both tasks were
addressed
through a booklet, entitled a prospectus although more than that, issued on
23 August 1994.  The prospectus was sent to
members of Association and
Insurance in a clear plastic cover accompanied by a separate two leaf document
known as an onsert.  The
notices of meeting in the prospectus were for general
meetings to be held on 19 October 1994, and the onsert included proxy
voting
papers for the general meetings.  Mailing of the prospectus package
began on 31 August 1994.
<P>

9	The approvals of the proposal by the boards of Association and Insurance, and
the resolutions by those boards to proceed with
it, were not unanimous.  On
22 September 1994 two of the directors opposed to the proposal, Mr Richard
Talbot and Miss Dawn Fraser,
filed an application in the Federal Court of
Australia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in relation to the
prospectus and
onsert and the holding of the general meetings.  Holdings,
Association and Insurance were respondents to the application.  
<P>

10	Gummow J ordered that there be heard separately from any other
questions the applicants' claims for a declaration that the members
of
Association and Insurance were not fully, fairly and adequately informed of the
proposal the subject of the resolutions to be
put before them or of the offers
made in the prospectus, for a declaration that the prospectus and the
information in it were misleading
in certain respects, and for injunctions
restraining the relevant respondents from proceeding with the meetings except
for the purpose
of adjourning them and from proceeding in any way with the
offers or the implementation of the restructuring and offers proposed
in the
prospectus.  The hearing of those claims took place on 5, 6 and 7 October
1994, and Gummow J gave judgment on 13 October 1994
(<i>Fraser v NRMA
Holdings Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1397.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1397</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2052%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 52 FCR 1).</a>  
<P>

11	I will shortly return to the application and his Honour's reasons, and for
the present it is sufficient that Gummow J held that
the prospectus was
misleading in what it said or did not say in certain respects, that by
distributing the prospectus and onsert
Holdings had engaged in misleading
conduct in contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> 1974</a>
("the TP Act"), and that by proceeding with the general meetings Association
and Insurance would be parties to and knowingly concerned
in that
contravention.  Injunctions were granted restraining further distribution of
the prospectus and onsert and restraining Association
and Insurance from
proceeding with any business at the general meetings except as necessary or
appropriate to adjourn them.
<P>

12	The general meetings convened for 19 October 1994 were opened, but in
accordance with the orders of Gummow J no substantive business
was
transacted and they were adjourned. 
<P>

13	Holdings, Association and Insurance sought leave to appeal from the decision
of Gummow J to the Full Court of the Federal Court.
 Full argument on the
merits of the appeal was heard on the application for leave on 6 and
7 December 1994.  The Full Court (Black
CJ, von Doussa and Cooper JJ)
gave judgment on 27 January 1995 (<i>NRMA Holdings Ltd v Fraser</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
55 FCR 452).</a>  
<P>

14	Leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed with a variation
in the orders of Gummow J.  Again I will shortly return
to the appeal and
their Honours' reasons, and for the present it is sufficient that the Full
Court did not uphold all the respects
in which the prospectus had been found by
Gummow J to be misleading, and held that it was misleading in a different
respect.  The
respects in which the prospectus was found wanting were in
connection with the description of the shares in Holdings to be issued
to
members as free shares and the disclosure of the disadvantages of the proposal.
The position was unchanged:  the general meetings
could not transact any
substantive business.
<P>

15	The judgment of Gummow J had left as a possibility the issuing of a
supplementary prospectus to rectify matters held to bring
about the misleading
conduct, and the judgment of the Full Court left an enhanced possibility.  The
NRMA still wanted to proceed
with the proposal, and was considering how best to
do so:  its consideration included by issuing a supplementary prospectus, and
some work towards a supplementary prospectus was done. 
<P>

16	Then on 8 March 1995 the High Court gave judgment in <i>Gambotto v WCP
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 432</a> ("<i>Gambotto's case</i>").  It will be necessary to
return to the course of <i>Gambotto's case</i> and the reasons of the High
Court, but the broad effect of the reasons was that the articles of a company
could not be changed by
special resolution to empower the majority shareholders
to expropriate the minority shareholders merely in order to secure a favourable
corporate structure.  
<P>

17	The NRMA took advice on the implications of this decision for the
demutualisation by the steps then involved in the proposal,
relevantly
resolutions in general meetings affecting the continuation of the memberships
of the members of Association and Insurance.
 After detailed consideration of
the matter, in May 1995 the NRMA decided not to proceed with the proposal,
whether with a supplementary
prospectus or at all.
<P>

18	So the attempt at demutualisation failed.  But the NRMA had spent a lot of
money.  In developing the proposal it had obtained
advice and assistance from
merchant banks, corporate advisers, underwriters, accountants, and lawyers. It
had obtained marketing
and public relations services from a number of providers
of such services.  The printing and postage of the prospectus package alone
cost millions of dollars, and there was a host of other costs, large and small,
associated with the formulation and implementation
of the proposal.  Then the
NRMA had incurred the costs of the Federal Court proceedings, and after those
proceedings had obtained
further merchant banking, legal, and other advice and
assistance.  Putting forward also a large sum for its internal costs, the NRMA
asserted a total expenditure of nearly $30 million.  It said that, with
the decision not to proceed with the proposal, the expenditure
was all wasted.

<P>

19	The lawyers from whom the NRMA had obtained advice were the firms of
solicitors Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley ("AAH") and Abbott
Tout ("AT") and,
through those firms, the barrister Mr Dyson Heydon QC.  The advice
included advice to do with the new structure
and the steps to achieve it and to
do with the content of the prospectus and the onsert.  In these proceedings the
NRMA alleged that
the lawyers were at fault in advice they gave and did not
give in those areas, and consequently engaged in or were involved in the
NRMA's
misleading conduct, and that they were responsible in law for the waste of the
expenditure.  It claimed the amount of the
wasted expenditure from them.
<P>

<center><b>II  FOUNDATION MATERIAL</b></center>
<P>

20	Central to these proceedings is an appreciation of the prospectus and the
onsert, of the reasons of Gummow J and the Full Court,
and of <i>Gambotto's
case</i> and its progress through the courts.  I will address those matters
now, as a foundation for what follows.
<P>

<b>The prospectus and the onsert</b>
<P>

21	The onsert was the first part of the prospectus package seen by the member,
and a description of the onsert should precede the
description of the
prospectus.  There were a number of different versions of the onsert, according
to whether the member could vote
at all, whether the member could vote as a
member only of Association, whether the member could vote as a member of
Association and
also as a member of Insurance, or whether the member could vote
as a member only of Insurance, and in the case of voting as a member
of
Insurance according to whether one or more vote could be exercised.  By far the
majority of members were what was called situation
3 members, voting as a
member of Association and also as a member of Insurance.  The next largest
group was situation 2 members,
voting as a member only of Association.  The
other groups were relatively insignificant.
<P>

22	The onsert took a more significant role in these proceedings than in the
proceedings in the Federal Court, and seeing the majority
version in its
complete form will be of assistance.  As may be expected, the onsert went
through many drafts before reaching its
final form.  A copy of the onsert for
situation 3 members is appendix 1 to these reasons.  
<P>

23	The first page, the front of the first leaf, was intended to contain the
name and address of the member next to the postage details,
and came to be
called the carrier.  It was the topmost page in the prospectus package, visible
within the clear plastic cover.  The
second page, the back of the first leaf,
contained instructions to the member.  The third page, the front of the second
leaf, contained
both the proxy voting paper for the general meeting of
Association and the Acceptance of Free Shares form.  The fourth page, the
back
of the second leaf, contained the proxy voting paper for the general meeting of
Insurance.  The features of the onsert particularly
material to these
proceedings were -
<P>

(a)	the words "How to vote!" and "How many shares you will be given!" in
proximity across the first page;  for a time in the drafting
history of the
carrier the latter words had been, "How many FREE shares you will get!", and
the circumstances in which those words
were used and were changed will be
described in these reasons;
<P>

(b)	the reference to the onsert including an Acceptance of Free Shares in the
bottom left hand corner of the first page;  this was
a relative constant in the
drafts;
<P>

(c)	the asterisk against "Free Shares" in the first line of the instructions on
the second page, and the marginal note to which
it referred stating that "The
Free Shares (or cash alternative) are in exchange for membership under the
Articles of each of NRMA
Ltd and NRMA Insurance Ltd ...";  as will be
described, the asterisk and marginal note were introduced in conjunction with
the change
in words in (a);  and
<P>

(d)	the Acceptance of Free Shares form on the third page in proximity to the
proxy voting paper for the general meeting of Association.
<P>

24	The onsert for the other situations where the member could vote had the same
features.  The onsert for the situation where the
member could not vote did not
have "How to vote!" or the proxy voting papers, and did not have that part of
the instructions to do
with voting, but did have "How many shares you will be
given!" and, with appropriate changes, the references to Free Shares with
the
asterisk and marginal note and the Acceptance of Free Shares form.
<P>

25	The prospectus was a document of 100 pages, attractively presented and
enhanced by photographs of NRMA personnel and operations.
 After some
preliminary material, it was divided into nine Sections.  It made frequent use
of the phrase "Free Shares", a phrase
defined in its Section 9 devoted to
"Definitions and Technical Terms" as meaning "the NRMA shares offered to
members under the Members
Free Offer".  This definition in turn took up the
definitions of "NRMA shares" as meaning "some or all (depending on the context)
of the fully paid ordinary shares of $1.00 par value each in NRMA Holdings
offered under this prospectus" and of "Members Free Offer"
as meaning "the
offer of Free Shares to members as described in Section 2".
<P>

26	In the following description of the prospectus, it must be remembered that
it was intended that it do at least two jobs.  It
was not just a prospectus
providing information material to an offer of shares in Holdings.  It also
contained notices of the general
meetings of Association and Insurance and
information to inform members as to the proposal so that they could vote on the
resolutions
to be put forward at the meetings.  The description concentrates
upon features of the prospectus material to these proceedings.
<P>

27	It was stated on the inside of the cover of the prospectus that it was
issued by Holdings and Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd ("Perpetual").
 Perpetual
was included because, under the proposal as finally determined, there was a
second stage offer of shares in Holdings by
Perpetual.  The first stage offer
of shares in Holdings was by Holdings to former members of Association and
Insurance, being the
Members Free Offer.  Those shares not taken up pursuant to
the offer under the Members Free Offer would go into the NRMA Offer Trust,
of
which Perpetual was trustee, and would be offered to institutions, to members
and policy holders, and then to the public, under
the "Sale Offer":  the Sale
Offer was the second stage offer.  In the definitions, the offer to members and
policy holders part of
the Sale Offer was described as the "Members Extra
Shares Offer", distinct from the Members Free Offer and defined as "the
invitation
made pursuant to this prospectus to members and non-member
policyholders to apply to buy NRMA shares as described in Section 2".
 The
shares under the Sale Offer were not described as Free Shares.
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=28%20Page%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">28	Page 1</a> of the prospectus was introductory.  It was said that the prospectus
provided information on the NRMA "which will help you decide
whether you want
NRMA shares", and that it "explains the proposal and its implications".
Members were urged to vote, and it was said
that the boards of Association and
Insurance recommended that members of each vote in favour of the proposal and
that members of
Association "choose the Free Shares".  It was said that the
prospectus should be kept because "[A]s well as the proposal to issue
the Free
Shares, members may be able to buy extra NRMA shares during the Sale Offer".
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=29%20Page%202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">29	Page 2</a> of the prospectus was a contents page, providing an index to the nine
Sections which followed.  Before those Sections, however, on
pages 3 and 4
there was a "President's Letter" on a Holdings letterhead reading -
<P>

"Dear Member,
<P>

As a member of the NRMA you are facing one of the most important decisions in
the proud history of the organisation.
<P>

The NRMA, like many other mutual organisations, has reached a crossroads. It is
time to decide:
<P>

*  whether we continue to operate within our current structure - which has been
successful but which does not permit the members
to share in the wealth and
financial successes of the organisation; or 
<P>

*  whether we adopt a new structure which will build on the current successes
and permit members to share in the wealth and future
financial successes of the
organisation.
<P>

In short, the proposal is to unlock the wealth of the organisation by giving
members Free Shares. The Proxy Voting Paper that came
on the outside of this
prospectus will have told you the number of Free Shares you will receive and an
estimate of their value. The
proposal and its implications for you are detailed
in Section 1 of this prospectus. If the proposal is adopted, members' financial
ownership of the NRMA will be formalised. The Boards of the Association and
NRMA Insurance have each considered the options and have
concluded that the
share issue is in the best interests of members and policyholders.
<P>

The restructure will not affect the way we operate. The NRMA will continue to
provide efficient Road Service and competitive insurance.
There will be no
change in the road patrols. The restructure will however give us greater
flexibility in developing businesses for
the benefit of all members and
policyholders.
<P>

<b>The Boards therefore strongly recommend that you vote in favour of the
proposal and accept the Free Shares</b>
<P>

In my 14 years as a member of the Board of the Association, I have seen the
organisation grow and prosper. This proposed change
in structure will place us
in an even stronger position to maintain our high standard of service and our
competitiveness.
<P>

The decision is yours. On Wednesday 19 October, there will be two general
meetings at which you will make the decision. You can
vote and accept your Free
Shares by post using the Proxy Voting Paper and Acceptance of Free Shares form
that came on the outside
of this prospectus.
<P>

Only if 75% of members who vote are in favour can the shares be issued.
Therefore don't leave it to others to vote. Your vote and
the vote of your
fellow members will determine the NRMA's future, so don't delay:
<P>

*  consider the proposal using the details in this prospectus;
<P>

*  complete and sign both the `In Favour' sections of the Proxy Voting Paper
and Acceptance of Free Shares form that came on the
outside of this prospectus
and encourage your family and friends to do likewise, so the proposal will
receive the requisite 75% vote;
<P>

*  mail the Proxy Voting Paper and the Acceptance of Free Shares form to us so
that we receive it preferably by no later than 12
October 1994.
<P>

Act now and Share the Future with a great organisation - your NRMA.
<P>

Yours sincerely
<P>

[signature]

DON MACKAY
<P>

President"
<P>

30	Section 1 of the prospectus was entitled "Information for Members", and
occupied pp 5 to 20.  The features of the prospectus
in this Section
particularly material to these proceedings (apart from the references to Free
Shares) were the recommendations to
vote in favour of the proposal, the
references to consideration of advantages and disadvantages and the extent of
discussion of advantages
and disadvantages, and the express references to
members giving up membership.  The last-mentioned references are emphasised in
their
reproduction in these reasons, for ease of later identification.
<P>

31	The introduction within Section 1 read -
<P>

"<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

		This Section is provided by the Boards of NRMA Ltd (`the Association') and
NRMA Insurance Ltd (`NRMA Insurance').
<P>

<b>THE NRMA </b>	From its origins as a club with some 50 members
<P>

<b>TODAY	</b>formed in 1920, the NRMA has grown to become one of the world's
leading motoring organisations with over 1.8 million members and assets
under
management of more than $6 billion at 31 March 1994. The tremendous loyalty of
the NRMA's members and policyholders has come
from the excellence of the
services provided by the NRMA over many years.
<P>

<b>BENEFITS</b>	Under the NRMA's  current structure  the wealth 
<P>

<b>OF CHANGE</b>	that is the product of this success is locked away,
inaccessible to members of each of the Association and NRMA Insurance. The
challenge
for the NRMA was to find a way of unlocking that wealth while
ensuring that it continues to provide excellent service.
<P>

		The NRMA is proposing to change its legal structure to enable its financial
success to be shared with its members. At the same
time, the new structure will
allow the NRMA to remain a unique institution which continues to provide
quality service.
<P>

		The primary benefit of the proposal is that members of the Association will
receive Free Shares allowing them to share in the
future financial success of
the NRMA.

*	Vote `Yes'	best interests of members and the NRMA.  The
<P>

* Accept the	Boards therefore recommend that:
<P>

   Free Shares	* members of each of the Association and NRMA 
<P>

			Insurance vote in favour of the proposal;
<P>

			* members of the Association choose the Free 
<P>

			Shares."
<P>

32	There was then a description of the proposal.  It began with the statement
that members had the opportunity to become shareholders
of Holdings, described
as "a new company which will own the NRMA businesses".  It was then
said -
<P>

"If you were a member of the Association on 16 March 1994, you are being
offered Free Shares in NRMA Holdings Ltd. You may choose
to take the free
shares or to take the cash alternative. If you choose to take your free shares,
you will become a shareholder of
NRMA Holdings Ltd."
<P>

33	After a diagram representing the proposed new structure, in which Holdings
was shown as wholly owning Association and Insurance,
it was said that road
service and other services would continue as they had in the past, and that as
"an NRMA shareholder" the member
would have valuable shares reflecting the
market value of the NRMA's businesses and the rights to receive dividends,
elect directors,
and vote at annual general meetings.  Against the marginal
heading "Free Shares in the NRMA" appeared -
<P>

"NRMA shares are now being offered free to all members of the Association as at
16 March 1994. You may choose to take the Free Shares
or the cash alternative.
If we do not receive a valid Acceptance of Free Shares form from you, you will
get the cash alternative.
Make your choice by filling out the Acceptance of
Free Shares form which came on the outside of the prospectus and return it in
the
postage paid envelope.
<P>

Any NRMA shares which members have not accepted will then be offered for sale.
Members and non-member policyholders will be the
first to be given the
opportunity to buy NRMA shares, except for some NRMA shares set aside to enable
a fair price to be established."
<P>

34	Further descriptions of the cash alternative, and reiteration of the need
for a 75 per cent vote in favour, followed, and there
was then a
description of the basis on which the Free Shares being offered to members of
Association had been allocated.  All members
of Association as at 16 March 1994
were offered shares, an additional allocation was offered if the membership was
"linked to an
NRMA Insurance policy" at 16 March 1994, and "the longer the
membership (using five year intervals) the greater the entitlement"
with a 25
year maximum.  The entitlements ranged from 250 Free Shares for a recent member
with no policy to 1000 Free Shares for
a long standing member with one or more
policies.  In addition, relatively small numbers of non-members were being
offered Free Shares:
 members admitted on and after 17 March 1994, employees of
the NRMA, some spouses and deceased members, and a miscellaneous group
of
members of Insurance who were not members of Association. 
<P>

35	Some paragraphs then purported to answer the marginal note "How the
Sharemarket Works", and then there appeared -
<P>

"<b>COSTS AS A</b>	The major additional cost of being a listed company
<P>

<b>LISTED </b>	will be the cost of maintaining a share register.
<P>

<b>COMPANY</b>	This is a necessary cost of enabling shareholders to receive
dividends and to buy and to sell NRMA shares.
<P>

<b>THE NRMA	</b>The NRMA's first priority is to keep our members'
<P>

<b>COMMITMENT	</b>loyalty which has been built up over many years and has
contributed so much to our success.
<P>

		Successful organisations know that meeting customers' needs in the key to
long term success. The NRMA has been following this
formula for decades.
<P>

		The NRMA's commitment to promoting motorists' interests, providing efficient
road service, other member services and insurance
at reasonable prices will
continue. The devotion to members' needs has seen the NRMA win the Australian
Quality Award and other independent
recognitions of service excellence.
<P>

		Only the legal framework of the NRMA will change, not its culture.
<P>

		The objectives of the Association presently include and will continue to
include:
<P>

		*  to promote the interests of motorists and other road users throughout
Australia in good roads, safety and consumer protection;
<P>

		*  to provide motorists and others with a range of services, including
provision of emergency or breakdown road service and other
services to
vehicles.
<P>

		NRMA Holdings' constitution will require that these objectives of the
Association continue for the benefit of Service Members
and all road users."
<P>

36	A heading "Other Options" followed, under which was -
<P>

"<b>WHAT OTHER 	</b>The NRMA has considered the advantages and 
<P>

<b>OPTIONS </b>	disadvantages of a range of options and 
<P>

<b>WERE	</b>concluded that the share issue and listing on the 
<P>

<b>CONSIDERED?	</b>Stock Exchange is in the best interests of members and the
NRMA.
<P>

		Other options which have been examined include:
<P>

		<b>1.  Doing nothing</b>: The NRMA could continue to operate under its
present structure, but the Boards believe that, by becoming shareholders,
members will
be better off.
<P>

		No organisation can rest on its laurels and assume that the way things have
always been done will work in the future. The NRMA
has made many changes to its
operations in the past and has always looked for better ways to do business.
That has made it a market
leader.
<P>

		This is another change which the Boards believe will significantly benefit
members and make the NRMA stronger in the future. To
do nothing means the
wealth of the organisation remains locked up and inaccessible to members.
<P>

		<b>2.  Reducing premiums and membership fees:</b> Charging artificially low
prices for our services means that current members subsidise the new customers
who would undoubtedly rush
to take advantage of artificially low prices.
Reducing charges for NRMA services and products below their true cost will
weaken the
financial strength of the NRMA and increases pressure for large
price rises in the future.
<P>

		<b>3.  Continue insurance rebates:</b> Many of the same problems mentioned
above are also relevant to continuing insurance rebates. In addition, rebates
only benefit policyholders
- and not the some 30% of members who do not hold
insurance policies. By giving members Free Shares, all members can benefit
directly
from the success of the NRMA.
<P>

		<b>4.  Making a one-off major payment to Association or NRMA Insurance
members:</b> Such a major payment would deplete the NRMA's reserves, greatly
reducing the NRMA's financial strength. Such a payment could also
be liable to
significant tax when received by members.
<P>

		<b>5.  Sell off NRMA Insurance:</b> Selling off NRMA Insurance would
effectively split the NRMA apart. The NRMA's strength lies in the value of road
service and insurance,
with each benefiting the other. If they were to be
separated, each would be weakened. The value of the combination is greater than
its parts. Separating the two would mean splitting the staff of the NRMA,
thereby destroying the very culture which has made the
NRMA a success."
<P>

37	This was followed by the heading "The Next Steps" , under which was -
<P>

<b>"MEMBERS'	</b>On Wednesday 19 October 1994 there will be 
<P>

<b>GENERAL	</b>two general meetings at Sydney Convention and
<P>

<b>MEETINGS	</b>Exhibition Centre, Darling Harbour. Details of the meeting
times and the resolutions to be considered are at the end of this Section.
One
meeting will be for the Association and the other for NRMA Insurance. These
meetings will decide the future structure of the
NRMA and members can
participate either by attending the meetings in person or by filling in the
Proxy Voting Paper which came on
the outside of the prospectus.
<P>

		Having carefully considered the implications of the proposal, the Boards
believe that this proposal is in the best interests of
members and the NRMA.
<P>

		The Boards urge members to vote IN FAVOUR of the resolutions. If voting by
post, members should return the Proxy Voting Paper
which came on the outside of
the prospectus, preferably by 12 October. There are legal time limits which are
explained at the end
of this Section but 12 October will meet all the
deadlines.
<P>

		All members whether voting in favour of or against the resolutions should
also fill out the Acceptance of Free Shares section
of the form.
<P>

<b>LEGAL STEPS</b>	<u>Members'  approval  will  mean  members  of the</u>
<P>

<b>INVOLVED IN</b>	<u>Association  and  members  of NRMA  Insurance</u> 
<P>

<b>CHANGE	</b><u>will no longer be members of those companies</u>. The
Association presently controls NRMA Insurance by appointing its Board. For an
NRMA Insurance policyholder to be eligible to
have become a member of NRMA
Insurance, the policyholder must have been a member of the Association. Members
of the Association are,
therefore, being offered an automatic entitlement to
Free Shares, with an additional allocation if the membership was linked to an
NRMA Insurance policy (other than Life or Travel). For these reasons the Boards
consider that members of NRMA Insurance have interests
similar to those of the
members of the Association.
<P>

		The legal elements of the approval by members of the Association and members
of NRMA Insurance are:
<P>

		*  changing the legal status of the Association and NRMA Insurance from
companies limited by guarantee to companies limited by
shares and guarantee;
<P>

		*  adopting new Articles for each company, <u>the central element of which
means that members (other than NRMA Holdings) agree to give up their membership
of the Association and
NRMA Insurance on condition that Free Shares are offered
by NRMA Holdings</u>. This leaves NRMA Holdings as the only member of the
Association, and NRMA Holdings and the Association as the only members of NRMA
Insurance, and hence each is under the control of NRMA Holdings. By a
resolution of the Boards, NRMA Holdings was admitted as a member
of the
Association on 4 August 1994 and as a member of NRMA Insurance on 16 August
1994. The special resolutions (if passed) constitute
an agreement which binds
all members of the Association and of NRMA Insurance, even if they voted
against the proposal or did not
vote at all;
<P>

		*  approving, first, the allocations of entitlements to Free Shares as
described earlier (people who are being allocated entitlements
to Free Shares
are referred to as `those entitled' in this paragraph), second, the allotment
by NRMA Holdings of the Free Shares
to those entitled who elect to take up the
Free Shares and, third, the allotment to the NRMA Offer Trust of shares not so
taken up.
The Trust will sell the shares and distribute the net proceeds of
sale to both those entitled who choose the cash alternative and
those entitled
from whom we do not receive a valid Acceptance of Free Shares form;
<P>

		*  in the case of the Association, approving changes to the Memorandum and
Articles of NRMA Insurance so that the Association
ceases to control NRMA
Insurance with the result that NRMA Holdings controls NRMA Insurance; and
<P>

		*  approving the overall changes in the structure of the NRMA so that each of
the Association and NRMA Insurance is owned and
controlled by NRMA Holdings.
<P>

		You will find the Notices of Meeting for the Association and NRMA Insurance
at the end of this Section."  [Emphasis added]
<P>

38	After a description of the beneficial taxation treatment to be extended to
acceptance of Free Shares or the cash alternative,
the Section
continued -
<P>

"<b>MEMBERS' QUESTIONS</b>
<P>

*<b>  What happens if members reject the proposal?</b>
<P>

If either of the members of the Association or the members of NRMA Insurance do
not pass the special resolutions to approve the
proposed restructuring, the
NRMA structure will remain the same as it is today. The Free Shares will not be
issued.
<P>

*  <b>What happens if I don't vote?</b>
<P>

The special resolutions (if passed) constitute an agreement which binds all
members of the Association and of NRMA Insurance, even
if you voted against the
proposal or did not vote at all. Members should make sure they vote. Only if
75% of those members who vote
are in favour can the Free Shares be issued.
Therefore members should not presume that other people's votes will achieve the
desired
result. If a member deliberately abstains from voting, they [sic]
should still fill in the Acceptance of Free Shares form that came
on the
outside of the prospectus.
<P>

*  <b>What happens if I don't choose Free Shares or the cash
alternative?</b>
<P>

By law you cannot be given the Free Shares unless you validly choose them on
the form supplied. If you don't choose to take the
Free Shares, you will get
the cash alternative.
<P>

*  <b>Will the NRMA change its culture?</b>
<P>

No. The NRMA's commitment to Road Service and competitive insurance is a
tremendously successful formula <u>and will remain</u>. What changes is the
structure of the organisation so that members get Free Shares. Our emphasis on
service quality, coupled with
being able to adapt to new and better ways of
doing business, will not change, as these are the keys to the NRMA's
success.
<P>

*  <b>With shareholders, will the NRMA pursue profit at the expense of
service?</b>
<P>

The NRMA's reputation for superior customer service is one of the main
contributions to the organisation's success over the past
74 years.
<P>

It is fundamental to the success of a business to get and keep customers.
Profit alone is not the mission of any well-run company,
it is the result of
serving customers better than your competitors.
<P>

The culture of the NRMA has always demanded, and will continue to demand, that
we serve our customers better than our competitors.
It is because we have been
`customer-focused' for so long that we have generated the profits that underpin
the NRMA's financial strength.
Put another way, service has always been at the
core of the NRMA's winning formula.
<P>

The correct question, then, is not `Will profits be pursued at the expense of
service?', but `What new ways will the NRMA find to
improve its service so that
customers will continue to choose us and profits can be maintained?'
<P>

The NRMA's culture encourages innovations in customer service and rewards
individual service initiatives. This reflects the NRMA's
strong belief that
profits and superior service, rather than being incompatible objectives, go
hand in hand.
<P>

NRMA Holdings will have three types of protection against takeover. The first
operates for five years and the other two will last
beyond that.
<P>

The first is a special protection against takeover which will last until 1
January 2000. The Articles of NRMA Holdings prohibit
any person (or company)
from owning 5% or more of the shares in NRMA.
<P>

This 5% limit will also apply to groups of people or companies (known as
associates) acting together to control a block of NRMA
shares which together is
5% or more. For some time now it has been a breach of company law if a person
(and that person's associates)
fail to notify a listed company when that 5%
threshold is crossed. If NRMA Holdings were to receive such a notification (as
required
by the Corporations Law) that a person had gone over the 5% limit,
then the Articles of NRMA Holdings provide that all voting and
dividend rights
of all the shares concerned (not just the surplus above 5%) are automatically
suspended. Further, the directors of
NRMA Holdings can then require that NRMA
shares be sold to bring the number the person has below the 5% limit.
<P>

More details on those special protective provisions in the Articles of NRMA
Holdings are set out in Section 8 of the prospectus.
<P>

A second protection against takeover is provided by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Acquisitions
and Takeovers Act 1991</a> (Commonwealth). This legislation provides that no person
or associated persons may acquire, without the prior approval of the Treasurer,
shares in any insurance company which is authorised to carry on business in
Australia, if those shares when aggregated with other
shares applied for or
held by that person or associated parties would amount to 15% or more of the
shares. There are penalties for
failure to comply and the Treasurer may order
the disposal of shares acquired or issued in such contravention of the
legislation.
NRMA Holdings will be the holding company of NRMA Insurance and
NRMA Life Ltd and the provisions of this legislation therefore apply
to any
acquisition of shares in NRMA Holdings.
<P>

The third form of protection lies with the shareholders themselves. Even if
approval could be obtained from the Treasurer, a person
or company attempting a
takeover would face the very great problem of persuading loyal shareholders to
give up their ownership of
the NRMA.
<P>

*  <b>Are all the directors in favour of the proposal?</b>
<P>

There are 16 directors of the Association. Of these 13 are in favour of the
proposal. The other 3 are against the proposal.
<P>

There are 11 directors of NRMA Insurance, 8 of whom are common to the Board of
the Association. Only 1 director of NRMA Insurance
is against the proposal,
that director being 1 of the 3 Association directors who are against it.
<P>

Overall, therefore, there are 16 directors who are recommending the proposal to
members.
<P>

*  <b>Will the cost of my Service Membership go up?</b>
<P>

The change in legal structure of the NRMA will not mean that the cost of
Service Membership will go up. Any increases in Service
Membership will only be
dictated by the need to properly price this product, which is the same basis of
setting the cost of Road
Service membership as has been applied in the past.
<P>

*  <b>What happens to membership cards?</b>
<P>

Your current card will continue to entitle you to all services. We will send
you a Service Membership card when it is time for you
to pay your next annual
subscription. This card will be much the same as your current card and will
show the number of years you
have been a member.
<P>

Gold Card members will continue to receive their special benefits.
<P>

*  <b>How will the Free Shares affect my Social Security benefits?</b>
<P>

For most people who receive Social Security benefits the proposal will be
financially beneficial, although their payments and benefits
may change
slightly. Some, however, will be adversely affected.
<P>

When this issue was first raised, we commissioned an independent investigation
of the position of people who receive Social Security
benefits in the light of
the proposal. A range of pensioner and other representative groups from the
community sector were consulted
in order to establish their views.
<P>

This issue is complex, as there are many different categories of Social
Security beneficiaries.
<P>

Based on an extensive examination, it was found that only a relatively small
number of pensioners would face unintended consequences.
These people are
already close to cut-off points and many already receive very small benefits,
due to the size of their income and
assets. A smaller number may be more
seriously affected.
<P>

To ensure the best possible outcome for this small group (representing less
than 1% of the NRMA membership), the NRMA has funded
a free independent phone
service, to be conducted by the Council on the Aging. If you think you might be
amongst this small group,
and need help to arrange your affairs, you can call
<b>008 65 63</b> and have the options explained to you. This service will be
available from 5 September, between the hours of 9am to 3pm.
<P>

*  <b>When will members receive their Free Shares?</b>
<P>

If the proposal is approved by members of the Association and of NRMA
Insurance, members who choose the Free Shares will get those
shares and a
statement will be sent by early December confirming how many NRMA shares you
own.
<P>

			<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<P>

<b>THE BOARDS	</b>The NRMA Boards have carefully considered the
<P>

<b>RECOMMEND	</b>advantages and disadvantages  of  the  proposal 
<P>

*  Vote `Yes'	and  have  concluded that this proposal is in the 
<P>

*  Accept the	best interests  of members  and  the NRMA.  The
<P>

    Free Shares	Boards therefore recommend that:

	*  members of each of the Association and 
<P>

	    NRMA Insurance vote in favour of the 
<P>

	    proposal;
<P>

	*  members of the Association choose the Free 
<P>

	    Shares.
<P>

	Your vote is important.
<P>

	75% of those members of each company who vote (either in person or by proxy)
must vote `yes' for the proposal to go ahead."
<P>

39	The next two pages, still within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a>, contained the notices of
meeting.  The notice of meeting for Association read -
<P>

"NOTICE is hereby given that a general meeting of members of NRMA Ltd will be
held at Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, Darling
Harbour, at 10am
Wednesday 19 October 1994.
<P>

<b>Business - Change of status</b>
<P>

To consider and, if thought fit, to pass the following resolution as a special
resolution:
<P>

`That the restructuring of the NRMA, as described in the Information for
Members accompanying the Notice of this general meeting,
be approved and that
for that purpose:
<P>

(a)	the status of NRMA Ltd be converted from a company limited by guarantee to
a company limited both by shares and by guarantee;
<P>

(b)	the Memorandum of Association of NRMA Ltd be amended by:
<P>

(i)	adding at the end of Clause 4 the words "in addition to the amount (if any)
unpaid on any shares held by such member; and
<P>

(ii)	replacing Clause 5 with:
<P>

	`5.  The nominal capital of the Association is $10,000,000,000 
<P>

		  divided into 10,000,000,000 shares of $1.00 each';
<P>

(c)	the regulations contained in the document submitted to this meeting, and
for the purpose of identification signed by the Chairman,
be approved and
adopted as the new Articles of Association of NRMA Ltd to replace all the
existing Articles;
<P>

with each of (a), (b) and (c) above taking effect on the day the Australian
Securities Commission issues to NRMA Ltd a certificate
of registration as to
its new status, but all on the condition that the members of NRMA Insurance Ltd
prior to that time, have also
approved the restructuring of the NRMA.'
<P>

Note: The Information for Members is important and should be read carefully.
The purpose of the resolution is to make legal changes
which would result in
NRMA Holdings Ltd issuing shares to members of NRMA Ltd (and certain members of
NRMA Insurance Ltd). Within
three days of the issue of the prospectus NRMA
Holdings Ltd will apply for listing on the Stock Exchange. <u>As part of the
legal changes all members of NRMA Ltd (other than NRMA Holdings Ltd) will no
longer be members of NRMA Ltd and Road
Service will be provided under the
Service Membership contract on much the same terms as presently apply. This
will be on condition
that Free Shares in NRMA Holdings Ltd are offered by it.
It is the new company which will control the NRMA.</u>  Further information on
this is set out in the Information for Members. Copies of the proposed
Memorandum and Articles of Association
of NRMA Holdings Ltd and of NRMA Ltd are
available on request from the Secretary at 151 Clarence Street, Sydney."
[Emphasis added]
<P>

40	The notice of meeting for Insurance was similar in form and content,
including as to the Note.  The Note contained the sentences,
in place of the
emphasised sentences in the note in the notice of meeting for Association, "As
part of the legal changes all members
of NRMA Insurance Ltd (other than NRMA
Ltd and NRMA Holdings Ltd) will no longer be members of NRMA Insurance Ltd.
This will be on
condition that Free Shares in NRMA Holdings are offered by it.
It is the new company which will control the NRMA."
<P>

41	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a> of the prospectus was entitled "Details of the Members Free Offer
and the Sale Offer".  It occupied pp 22 to 34, and provided information
of
the kind indicated.  A feature material to these proceedings was that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a>
did not make express reference to members giving up membership - there was no
equivalent to the parts of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> emphasised in these reasons.  So the
definitions of Free Shares and thence the Members Free Offer took the reader to
a description
of the mechanics of the first stage offer, but did not direct the
reader's attention to the information in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> and to the emphasised parts
so far as they might shed light on the references to Free Shares. 
<P>

42	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a> included many references to Free Shares and entitlement to Free
Shares, more instructions about completing the Acceptance of Free
Shares form
in order to "choose the Free Shares", and a recommendation by the directors of
Holdings that members of Association and
Insurance vote in favour of the
proposal and members of Association choose the Free Shares.  (The
recommendations in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> had been by the boards of Association and
Insurance.)  Most of the pages were concerned with the NRMA Offer Trust and the
Sale Offer
and its constituents, including the Members Extra Shares Offer.  For
present purposes it is sufficient to refer in more detail to
two aspects of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2.</a>
<P>

43	First, against the marginal note "The Members Free Offer" appeared:
<P>

"Description
<P>

Entitlement to participate in the Members Free Offer is based on membership of
the Association.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> also identifies an exceptional group of NRMA
Insurance members who participate in the Members Free Offer. In this Section,
including
the diagram at the beginning of this Section, when we talk of
`members', it includes that group.
<P>

Your entitlement to Free Shares is shown on the Acceptance of Free Shares form
which came on the outside of this prospectus.
<P>

Members can use their personalised Acceptance of Free Shares form to choose
either:
<P>

*	Free Shares;  or
<P>

*	the cash alternative.
<P>

<i>When you choose to take Free Shares or the cash alternative, you will get
one or the other.  You cannot take some of each.</i>
<P>

The directors of NRMA Holdings recommend that:
<P>

*	members of each of the Association and NRMA Insurance vote in favour of the
proposal;
<P>

*	members of the Association choose the Free Shares."
<P>

This was followed by the instructions about completing the Acceptance of Free
Shares form.
<P>

44	Secondly, after a reference to the NRMA Offer Trust there appeared against
the marginal note "What if I Want to Buy More Shares"
-
<P>

"After choosing to take Free Shares some members may want to buy extra NRMA
shares.  This may be possible, but of course you would
have to pay for any
extra NRMA shares you want which are in addition to your Free Shares.  The
Members Extra Shares Offer enables
you to do this.
<P>

<i>If you only want Free Shares or the cash alternative, you do not have to pay
for any NRMA shares at all.  No member has to buy any
extra NRMA
shares."</i>
<P>

There was an evident distinction between the Free Shares available under the
Members Free Offer, for which the member did not have
to pay, and the shares
available under the Members Extra Shares Offer, for which the member did have
to pay.
<P>

45	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3</a> of the prospectus was entitled "Guide for Investors".  It occupied
pp 36 to 38, and purported to explain the position of, and benefits
falling to, a shareholder as an investor, and to outline taxation
considerations for shareholders.  There is no need to go further
into this
Section.
<P>

46	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of prospectus was entitled "The NRMA and its Business".  It
occupied pp 39 to 50, and was a generally laudatory description of the
NRMA's history, present motoring and insurance services, and intentions and
prospects for growth.
<P>

47	There followed in the prospectus pp A1 to A8 and application forms for
shares in Holdings, all to do with applying for shares
in the event of a Sale
Offer.  The application forms were described in the proceedings as generic
application forms, in that they
were appropriate for use by members or
non-members, and the instructions in the pages were not specific to members:
they included
a request for membership number or policy number if the applicant
was a member or a non-member policy holder of the NRMA, but said
that "priority
can only be assured by use of the personalised application for shares form" and
referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a> of the prospectus.  The personalised application was the
Acceptance of Shares form part of the onsert.  The application forms and
instructions provided for application monies to accompany the application
forms.  On p A8 some information about applications for
shares was placed under
the heading "Further Information for Members", but it was still not specific to
members.  It underlined,
however, that members were amongst those who could buy
shares in Holdings under the Sale Offer.
<P>

48	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of the prospectus was entitled "Financial Information".  It
occupied pp 51 to 60.  It is unnecessary to go into the detail of the
financial information.  That part of the financial information material to
these proceedings was the profit and loss summary of historical
performance for
the four years to 1992/93, estimated actual results for 1993/94, and forecast
results for 1994/95.  The narrative
stated that the forecasts for 1994/95 were
based on budgets prepared by management and adopted by the directors of
Holdings, and
that they were subject to uncertainties and variation and there
could be no guarantee or assurance they would be achieved;  they
had, however,
been independently reviewed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand (Securities) Ltd
("C&amp;L").  Certain assumptions on which the
forecasts were based were set
out, and it was said that the forecast investment return was "sensitive to
changes in the assumed return
on fixed interest and equities investments except
to the extent that fixed interest investments are held to meet insurance
liabilities".
 
<P>

49	Specifically, the forecast consolidated after-tax profit for the NRMA Group
as defined for 1994/95 was $215 million, significant
components of which were
an underwriting loss of $129 million and unrealised investment gains of $102
million.  The defendants' cases
included, in the manner I will later describe,
that there were later adverse movements in these components, and so in the
forecast
profit, material to the NRMA's financial position and requiring the
provision of supplementary information to members.
<P>

50	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> of the prospectus was entitled "Independent Accountant's Report".
It occupied pp 61 to 80, and was a report from C&amp;L addressed
to
Holdings and Perpetual expressed to "provide financial information relevant to
a decision to choose to take shares in NRMA Holdings
or the cash alternative,
and to provide potential investors with financial information relevant to their
decision on whether to invest
in NRMA Holdings."  Annexures to the report
presented a consolidated balance sheet of the NRMA Group as at 31 March
1994 and what
were described as "restated" consolidated profit and loss
accounts for the four years and nine months ended 31 March 1994.  Copious
notes were appended to these financial statements, and it was said in the
report that "a pro forma balance sheet of Holdings to give
effect to the
proposed restructuring" had been prepared on a particular basis.  Amongst other
things, the report then described C&amp;L's
review of the directors' forecast
financial information, making it clear that the review was less than an audit
examination and that
actual results might vary materially from the forecasts,
and concluded -
<P>

"<b>Forecast Financial Information</b>
<P>

Based on our review of the directors' Forecast:
<P>

*	nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the
directors' assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis
for the Forecast;
and
<P>

*	in our opinion the Forecast is properly compiled on the basis of the
underlying assumptions and on a basis consistent with the
accounting policies
of the NRMA.
<P>

<b>Subsequent events</b>
<P>

Since 31 March 1994 and up to the date of this report, significant movements
have occurred in the market values of investments held
by the NRMA.
Furthermore, losses have been realised through the sale of a large portion of
the fixed interest security portfolio
in order to more closely align the
maturity profile with that of the insurance provisions. The outcome of these
movements, including
the effect on the claims provisions, is reflected in the
estimated result for the year to 30 June 1994 set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of this
prospectus. Movements in value since 30 June 1994 to the date of this report
have not been significant in terms of their
effect on the results.
<P>

Other than the matters dealt with in this report, to the best of our knowledge
and belief there have been no material transactions
or events outside the
ordinary course of business of the NRMA Group which require comment on, or
adjustment to, the information contained
in this report, or which would cause
such information to be misleading."

calling for particular mention in these reasons.  The Section concluded with
the signatures to the prospectus of each director of
Holdings and (by its
common seal) Perpetual.  At one point in this Section was the statement,
"Neither NRMA Ltd nor NRMA Insurance

<P>

<b>The Judgments in the Federal Court proceedings</b>
<P>

55	Gummow J said (at 17) -
<P>

"The complaint of the applicants is, broadly, that the prospectus, the notices
of general meeting and the forms of proxy do not
put members in possession of
information appropriate to enable them to make an informed and critical
assessment of the proposal,
and to make an informed decision as to their
response. They say that if proper regard is had to what is said and left unsaid
this
shows contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaata1991383/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the Act. The fundamental allegation is
that by distribution to members of these documents there has been an
engagement, in trade
or commerce, in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or
likely to mislead or deceive."
<P>

The Act to which his Honour referred was the TP Act.  Section 52 of the TP Act
provided that a corporation should not, in trade
or commerce, engage in conduct
that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.  By s 80
of the TP Act, an injunction
could be granted to restrain the engaging in such
conduct.  The Australian Securities Commission ("ASC") appeared in the Federal
Court proceedings as amicus curiae, and drew attention to s 995(2) of the
Corporations Law ("the Law") which proscribed engaging
in conduct that was
misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in or in connection
with the allotment or issue of securities,
any prospectus issued in relation to
securities, or the doing of acts preparatory to or related to the allotment or
issue of securities.
 His Honour observed (at 18) that it appeared that a
finding of contravention of s 52 of the TP Act would have been accompanied
by
a finding of contravention of s 995 of the Law.
<P>

56	In detailed reasons, his Honour considered what was said and not said in the
prospectus which in his opinion made distribution
of the prospectus and onsert
engaging in misleading conduct.  In summary, his Honour found the misleading
conduct because -
<P>

(a)	the statement in the prospectus that Association controlled Insurance by
appointing its board (see the first paragraph against
the marginal heading
"Legal Steps Involved in the Change" in one of the extracts from the prospectus
earlier set out) was in its
context at best a half truth and, as such, apt to
mislead or deceive (at 24);
<P>

(b)	the statement in the prospectus that the two bodies of members were
considered to have similar interests (see the same paragraph
as identified in
(a)), without going on to make clear whether the respective boards considered
that the similarity of interest extended
to the purposes and effects of the
proposed restructuring outlined in the prospectus, was likely to mislead (at
26);  
<P>

(c)	the absence of disclosure, in connection with the basis on which the Free
Shares being offered members of Association had been
allocated (see the summary
of that part of the description of the proposal earlier in these reasons), such
as to enable members to
make a properly informed judgment concerning the
criteria for entitlement to Holdings' shares in relation to the relative values
of the assets and undertakings of Association and Insurance, gave rise to a
contravention of s 52 (at 27);  
<P>

(d)	it was misleading repeatedly to describe in the prospectus, particularly in
the passages most likely to be studied by the ordinary
reader, that which was
offered to members in connection with their consent to the restructuring as
"Free Shares", because the relinquishment
of membership involved the
relinquishment of significant rights to the control of the affairs of
Association and Insurance and demutualisation
removed the possibility of
further enjoyment of other benefits of membership (at 28);  and 
<P>

(e)	the treatment in the prospectus of whether the NRMA would change its
culture and how the restructuring would affect the way
it operated was not a
full and fair disclosure of intentions as to future conduct of the undertaking
to be acquired by Holdings after
demutualisation, and left in half-light
whether Holdings suggested that it would or would not conduct its business and
undertaking
so as not to affect in any substantial way the extent or cost of
services presently provided to members, or whether Holdings chose
to make no
statement on the subject 
<P>

(at 31-2).
<P>

57	Only misleading conduct in the respect in (d) was upheld by the Full Court,
and his Honour said in that respect (at 27-8) -
<P>

"No doubt one adjectival use of `free' is to describe that which is provided
without, or not subject to, a charge or payment.  Counsel
for Holdings submits
that that is what is meant in the prospectus with the use of the phrase `free
shares'.  He pointed, in particular
to the use, on p 21, the first page of
section 2, of the heading:
<P>

	Details of the
<P>

	Members Free Offer
<P>

	and the Sale Offer.
<P>

But, as I have indicated, the particular phrase is `free shares' and this is
used in the prospectus on many occasions.  In particular,
as counsel for the
applicants pointed out, the first two sections of the prospectus are replete
with use of `free shares' which is
not in any apposition to the `sale offer'.

<P>

Rather, the phrase is used to identify and attract the reader by suggesting
there are available for acquisition dividend yielding
shares at no outgoing to
the member.  This accords with another adjectival use of `free', to identify
that which is given without
consideration and as a gift.
<P>

It is true that in several places in Exs A, B and C, including the passage
identified by the asterisk on the leaflet headed "Important
Information Inside"
and on p 12 of the prospectus, it is said that the `free shares' are in
exchange for membership or that membership
is to be given up on condition of
the offer of the `free shares'.
<P>

Nevertheless, the effect of the persistent reiteration of the phrase `free
shares' is to engender in the reader the notion that
the shares may be acquired
without any significant loss or outgoing to the offeree who accepts them.  
<P>

Counsel for the respondents pointed to the provisions in the memoranda of
Insurance and the Association which would deny the members
a distribution of
assets on a winding-up.  That, as I understood the submissions, was used to
support the submission that, in truth,
there could be no significant
consideration moving from the members, so that the shares were `free'.
<P>

I have referred earlier to what might be called the ultimate control of
Insurance by the members, notwithstanding the manner in
which the board is
appointed.  The board of the Association is in a different position, it being
responsible for its election to
the members.  Furthermore, Art 26 of the
present articles of the Association obliges the board on the written
requisition of 200
or more members forthwith to convene a meeting of members to
be held as soon as practicable and, in any case, not later than two
months
after the date of the requisition.
<P>

The relinquishment of membership thus, in a legal sense, involves the
relinquishment of significant rights to the control of the
affairs of the two
corporations.  Further, `demutualisation' removes the possibility of further
enjoyment of the advantages described
earlier in these reasons.  
<P>

A basic question for members to decide, as pointed out earlier in these
reasons, is whether they will be better off remaining as
members or becoming
shareholders or recipients of the proposed cash distribution in lieu of shares.
It is a matter of weighing the
respective advantages and disadvantages of each
course of action.  In that setting, in my view it is likely to mislead or
deceive
to describe repeatedly in the prospectus, particularly in the passages
moot [sic; most] likely to be studied by the ordinary reader,
that which is
offered to members in connection with their consent to the reorganisation as
`free shares'.
<P>

58	Gummow J concluded (at 32) -
<P>

"The applicants have made out their case for declaratory relief as to
contravention of s 52 of the Act. The declaration should be
to the effect
that by distributing to members of the second and third respondents, the
Association and Insurance, documents, copies
of which are Exhibits A, B and C,
the first respondent, Holdings, in trade or commerce, has engaged in conduct
that is misleading
or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive. The nature of
the contraventions is such that it is not practical to quarantine any
particular portion of the prospectus. Nor, as the facts have unfolded and now
stand, would there be efficacy in ordering, before
the times appointed for the
general meetings, the disclosure of information or the publication of
corrective advertisements, by order
under s 87 of the Act. I note that the
particular power in that regard conferred by s 80A is exercisable only on
the application
of a Minister or the Trade Practices Commission.
<P>

Even without the present exigencies of time, it might not be practicable and
might be unwise for the Court to undertake the supervision,
with the suggestion
of its imprimatur, of the dissemination of `corrective' material.
<P>

What is appropriate is injunctive relief under s 80. There should be an
injunction against the further distribution by the respondents
of copies of
Exhibits A, B and C to members of the Association and Insurance.
<P>

The Court having been satisfied that Holdings has engaged in conduct that
constitutes contravention of s 52, it may grant an injunction
in such
terms as it determines to be appropriate (s 80(1)). The contraventions by
Holdings are directed to encouraging a particular
course of conduct by members
of the Association and Insurance in relation to the general meetings called by
the Association and Insurance
for 19 October 1994. For the Association and
Insurance to proceed with those meetings, as proposed, would be to become
parties to
and knowingly concerned in those contraventions. The injunctive
relief should include a restraint upon the Association and Insurance
from
proceeding with any business at the general meetings of members, identified in
the notices of general meeting in Ex C, other
than by the taking of such
steps as are necessary or appropriate to adjourn those meetings. These
restraints upon the Association
and Insurance should have the proviso `without
the leave of the Court': see <i>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade
Practices Commission</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/474.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 474</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2038%20FCR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 38 FCR 248</a> at 266-267."
<P>

Exhibits A, B and C were respectively the first leaf of the onsert, the second
leaf of the onsert, and the prospectus.  A declaration
and orders were made
accordingly.  The injunction restraining further distribution of the prospectus
and onsert, as distinct from
the injunction restraining proceeding with the
meetings, was not expressed to be subject to the leave of the Court.
<P>

59	As I have said, the Full Court did not uphold all the respects in which
engaging in misleading conduct had been found by Gummow
J, and it held
that there was misleading conduct in a different respect.  It upheld
Gummow J only in relation to the use of the phrase
"Free Shares", and it
held that the failure to identify and inform members about disadvantages of
which the directors making the
recommendation that members vote in favour of
the proposal were aware was "to leave the members in a half-light which had the
potential
to lead them to think that the unidentified disadvantages, whatever
they might be, must be ones that they would not treat as significant
in
relation to the rights being given up and the new rights to be acquired in a
public listed company".  The two respects on which
the decision of the Full
Court was founded were, in the view of the Court, linked in the manner
appearing at the ends of the two
passages from the judgment which follow.  I
will refer to them as the free shares question and the disadvantages
question.
<P>

60	As to the free shares question, the Full Court said (at 482-4) -
<P>

"The trial judge found in the applicants' favour on the `Free Shares' complaint
essentially because he considered that the persistent
repetition of the phrase
in the context engendered or was likely to engender the notion that the shares
might be acquired without
significant loss or outgoing and to suggest that such
rights of membership as were given up to participate in the affairs of
Association
and Insurance were of no value and were not material to a decision
to vote for or against the proposal. We turn now to consider that
issue.
<P>

His Honour noted that the proposal, by requiring the relinquishment of the
rights of the members of Association to control Association,
and through their
power to appoint the Council of Association to control the appointment of the
board of Insurance, involved `the
relinquishment of significant rights to the
control of the affairs of the two corporations'. Further, his Honour held that
`demutualisation'
would remove the possibility of further enjoyment of
advantages of subsidised road services and other members' services of
Association,
and of insurance rebates given to policyholders on certain classes
of policy available through Insurance. His Honour held that the
relinquishment
of these substantial rights was incompatible with the notion that the shares
might be acquired without significant
loss or outgoing.
<P>

In this connection, the respondents contended before this Court that his Honour
erred as a matter of fact in his conclusion that
the road services were
subsidised. We think his Honour's finding in that regard was justified by the
financial information on p 52
of the prospectus to which he referred. The
respondents also pointed out that the prospectus at pp 53 and 70 recorded
that the rebates
on insurance which had been provided in the past were not
expected to continue past 31 July 1995. His Honour did not overlook those
statements. He referred expressly to them when considering a statement in the
prospectus that the option of continuing insurance
rebates had been examined
and rejected for several reasons, one of which was that `rebates only benefit
policyholders - and not the
some 30% of members who do not hold insurance
policies'. As this reason disclosed, the benefit of rebates had arisen in the
past
from being a policyholder rather than a member of Insurance, but rebates
had been one of the traditional benefits of the mutual character
of the
organisations which would certainly disappear if the `demutualisation'
proceeded.
<P>

The respondents also contended that his Honour's criticism that the shares were
not `free' because valuable rights were being given
up was unjustified because,
it was submitted, it must have been crystal clear to even the least
sophisticated reader of the prospectus
that membership of the Association and
Insurance was being given up in exchange for shares in Holdings or for the cash
alternative.
We agree that statements to that effect are made in the margin on
the back of the first sheet of the onsert, in the notices of meeting,
and on
p 12 of the prospectus, but to the reader who was previously unfamiliar
with the nature of a mutual organisation and the process
of `demutualisation'
those statements, simple as they were, were liable in our view to be
overwhelmed in their impact by the far
more prominent and persistent reference
to `Free Shares'. This impact was enhanced by the packaging of the prospectus.
Before opening
the package the addressee would have been likely to be attracted
by the messages `Share the Future', `How to Vote!', and especially,
`How many
shares you will be given!' notwithstanding the additional words `There is MORE
information on the back of this page'. But
in any event, these statements that
membership will be relinquished do not answer the conclusion reached by the
trial judge which
was, in effect, that the description of the shares as `free'
was likely to mislead or deceive members into thinking that the rights
that
were to be given up by them were not rights which could be regarded by members
as being of importance to them in making a properly
informed judgment on the
proposal.
<P>

Although it is no doubt true that in some contexts, such as in the expression
`buy one, get one free', the word `free' may be understood
as meaning `without
additional or marginal outlay over what is obviously being paid', this is not
invariably so. `Free' can easily
be misleading or deceptive, depending on the
context: <i>Federal Trade Commission v Standard Education Society </i><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1937/142.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] USSC 142</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=302%20US%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">302 US
112</a>, 116-117 (1937); <i>Book of the Month Club v Federal Trade Commission</i>
<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA2/1953/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1953] USCA2 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=202%20F%202d%20486" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">202 F 2d 486</a>, 488 (2nd Cir 1953). We agree with the trial judge that in the
present context of a document that strongly argued in favour of voting
for the
proposed changes, the persistent use of the expression `Free Shares' was in
fact likely to engender the notion that the shares
might be acquired without
significant loss or outgoing and it was in this respect misleading or
deceptive, or likely to mislead or
deceive, to use that phrase.
<P>

This conclusion involved a finding that the rights to be given up were rights
which would be material to members of the Association
and Insurance in making a
properly informed judgment on the proposal. The respondents argued that this
has not been established by
the evidence. In particular it was argued that
membership of Insurance had no value; it was transitory, lasting only as long
as the
annual policies held by the member, there was no right of renewal; in
the case of policies held by two or more people it was a matter
of chance which
policyholder was entered as a member; no consideration was paid for membership;
membership was not transferable;
and, most importantly, the true beneficiary of
the wealth of Insurance was the Association. It was submitted that such powers
of
control of Insurance as existed in members of Insurance had no practical
significance in the circumstances. In particular, the members
had no power to
confer on themselves any direct financial benefit by way of dividends or
capital rights in the event of a winding
up. There is force in these
contentions in relation to membership of Insurance. But membership of the
Association carried with it
rights to participate in the control of
Association, and through the appointment of the Council of Association, in the
affairs of
Insurance. The evidence did not attempt to place any monetary value
on these rights, and it may be impossible to do so. But it does
not follow that
the rights would not be material to members of Association in making a properly
informed decision: cf <i>Re NFU Development Trust Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%201%20WLR%201548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 1 WLR 1548</a> at
1554;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20All%20ER%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 All ER 135</a> at 139. The rights of control if exercised by a
sufficient body of members could be used to require that the benefits which
have
been enjoyed in the past by members arising from the mutual character of
the NRMA organisation be continued in the future. The materiality
and
importance of the rights of control therefore depended in turn on the
materiality and importance to members of the continuation
of these benefits. It
was in this context that the trial judge said that a basic question for members
to decide was whether they
would be better off remaining as members or becoming
shareholders or recipients of the proposed cash distribution in lieu of shares,
a question that involved weighing the respective advantages and disadvantages
of each course of action."
<P>

61	As to the disadvantages question, the Full Court said (at 485-7) -
<P>

"In our opinion the treatment of the topic of the future conduct of the
undertaking has not been shown to be inadequate for failing
to make a clear
statement of Holdings' intentions. However we do consider that the treatment of
the topic was inadequate, and involved
a contravention of s 52, for
reasons to which we now turn.
<P>

Before this Court counsel for the applicants submitted that there was a
likelihood of change in the future conduct of the undertaking
of the NRMA
organisation for reasons of the following kinds which the prospectus failed to
bring sufficiently to the members' notice:
(i) whilst the present Boards
intended `business as usual' the proposed restructure involved a change in
status and membership; (ii)
shareholders in a listed company would have
different rights and expectations as shareholders, particularly in relation to
profit;
(iii) the duties and obligations of directors or corporations limited
by shares are, so it was submitted in relation to shareholders
(who in time
could become increasingly large and institutional) to look to profit and value
of shares and to pay dividends out of
profits available for that purpose, in
contrast with the duties of directors of a mutual association; (iv) Holdings
after reconstruction
would have the capacity to change the operation by selling
its assets or undertaking; (v) and in the long term the restructure opened
prospects for a takeover, or for effective control of Holdings to pass to a
small minority of large shareholders with strategic holdings.
To these matters
could be added the consideration that, with time, the composition of the Boards
would in any event change and future
boards would not be bound by statements of
intentions by the present board made in the prospectus.
<P>

Counsel for the respondents contended that there are good commercial reasons
why it is unlikely that Holdings would in the future
abandon the `culture'
which has been instrumental to the success of the NRMA organisation in the
past, and that the prospect of control
of Holdings being seized by a minority
of large shareholders or otherwise taken over or disposed of is fanciful for
several reasons.
Whether these contentions adequately answer the applicants'
submission is largely a matter of opinion about which the members must
make a
judgment when deciding upon the proposal and weighing the respective advantages
of continued membership of mutual associations
against a shareholding in
Holdings or the cash alternative. Unless the information available to the
members brings to their attention
matters of the kind identified by the
applicants' submissions (along with any other disadvantages perceived by those
members of the
Boards whose decisions recommend the proposal), and the reasons
why it is asserted that the disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages,
the
members are not fully and fairly informed why they will be `better off' by
voting to receive shares or the cash alternative in
exchange for their
membership of the Association and Insurance.
<P>

The prospectus as a whole, but particularly in the President's letter and the
Information to Members, strongly encourages a favourable
response to the
proposed restructure and conveys the recommendation of the majority of each
board that under it the members will
be `better off'. We agree with the trial
judge that the prospectus does not explain or quantify why this will be the
case beyond
the statement that the wealth of the NRMA organisation will be
unlocked by giving each member the share entitlement identified on
that
member's onsert.
<P>

On p 6 of the prospectus, when repeating the recommendation of the Boards
which was stated on p 1, it is said `The NRMA Boards have
carefully
considered the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and have concluded
that this proposal is in the best interests
of members and the NRMA'. Here is a
statement that there are disadvantages to be considered, yet nowhere in the
prospectus are the
disadvantages identified, explained or compared with the
perceived advantages. On p 11 the prospectus says the NRMA has considered
the advantages and disadvantages of a range of other options and concluded that
the share issue and listing on the Stock Exchange
is in the best interests of
members of the NRMA. Five other options are discussed. This discussion fails to
identify what the disadvantages
of the recommended proposal might be.
<P>

The first of the other options discussed was `Doing nothing'. The prospectus
reads:
<P>

<b>`1.  Doing nothing: </b> The NRMA could continue to operate under its
present structure, but the Boards believe that, by becoming shareholders,
members will
be better off.
<P>

No organisation can rest on its laurels and assume that the way things have
always been done will work in the future. The NRMA has
made many changes to its
operations in the past and has always looked for better ways to do business.
That has made it a market leader.
<P>

This is another change which the Boards believe will significantly benefit
members and make the NRMA stronger in the future. To
do nothing means the
wealth of the organisation remains locked up and inaccessible to members.'
<P>

This discussion fails to state, at least in any meaningful way, the
disadvantages about the proposed restructure which the Boards
had recommended,
and fails to refer to the matters identified in the applicants' submissions. At
p 15, where the prospectus for the
first time discloses that three of the
16 directors of the Association and one of the 11 directors of Insurance are
against the proposal,
there is no statement of the dissenting directors'
reasons which could serve to redress the failure of the prospectus otherwise to
inform the members about the disadvantages of the proposal.
<P>

The prospectus asserts that under the proposed restructure members will be
`better off' and strongly recommends a `yes' vote. In
these circumstances the
failure to identify and inform members about disadvantages of which the
directors making the recommendation
were aware was to leave the members in a
half light which had the potential to lead them to think that the unidentified
disadvantages,
whatever they might be, must be ones that they would not treat
as significant in relation to the rights being given up and the new
rights to
be acquired in a public listed company. This is more particularly so when it is
remembered that, contrary to the notion
engendered by the persistent use of the
phrase `Free Shares', the shares might be acquired without significant loss or
outgoings,
the rights that would be surrendered were significant ones which
were material to the members of Association in making a properly
informed
judgment."
<P>

62	The NRMA's case that the lawyers were at fault, and engaged in or were
involved in the NRMA's misleading conduct, was in the
area of the content of
the prospectus and the onsert tied back to the respects in which the Full Court
found misleading conduct.
 The NRMA did not contend for any other respect in
which the prospectus was misleading, or rely on the respects found by Gummow J
but not upheld by the Full Court, and its case in this area was conducted on
the basis that the reasons of the Full Court expounded
the deficiencies in the
prospectus to be laid at the lawyers' doors.  Some analysis of the deficiencies
as found is appropriate even
at this point in these reasons.
<P>

63	For the free shares question, it can be seen that the reasoning of the Full
Court was that the persistent use of the phrase "Free
Shares" conveyed that the
shares might be acquired without significant loss or outgoing, and that this
was likely to mislead or deceive
because there might be significant loss or
outgoing if the rights lost when membership was given up "could be regarded by
members
as being of importance to them in making a properly informed judgment
on the proposal" or could be "material to the members of Association
in making
a properly informed decision".  
<P>

64	When I come to the facts in the present case, there will be much to do with
describing the shares to be issued by Holdings as
free shares provided members
are informed that the shares are in return for their giving up membership, and
in describing the prospectus
I have emphasised the express references to
members giving up membership.  It was not an answer to the reasoning of the
Full Court,
or that of Gummow J, that there were statements in the onsert and
the prospectus to the effect that membership was given up in exchange
for the
shares.  Gummow J acknowledged those statements, but the deficiency remained
that the persistent use of the phrase "Free
Shares" conveyed that what was
given up was not significant - it was really a failure in informing members
what giving up membership
involved, to be taken into account when weighing the
advantages and disadvantages of demutualisation.  The Full Court also
acknowledged
those statements, although their Honours observed that they "were
liable to be overwhelmed in their impact by the far more prominent
and
persistent reference to `Free Shares'", but the deficiency remained that the
description of the shares as free conveyed that
the rights to be given up might
not be material to making a properly informed judgment on the proposal.  
<P>

65	The reasoning of the Full Court directed attention to the nature and
significance of the lost rights, and to why they would be
material to the
members' decision on the proposal.  The Full Court said that there was force in
the contention that the rights of
membership in Insurance were not material,
but that the rights of membership in Association might be material not because
of a monetary
value (which it may be impossible to establish) but because the
combined exercise of the rights by a sufficient body of members could
be used
to preserve the existing benefits arising from the mutual character of the
NRMA.  The link with the disadvantages question
was, then, that materiality and
importance of the rights of control depended in turn on the materiality and
importance of the existing
benefits, and so on an understanding of the
respective advantages and disadvantages of continuing as before or embracing
demutualisation.
 
<P>

66	These things may be said of this analysis.  First, and repeating what I have
already said, at the heart of the misleading conduct
in this respect was not
that the prospectus and onsert failed adequately to inform members that
membership would be given up in exchange
for shares.  Secondly, if that which
brought the misleading conduct was that members might be misled into thinking
that the membership
rights were not rights which they could regard as important
in making a properly informed judgment on the proposal, or could regard
as
material to a properly informed decision, at the heart of the misleading
conduct in this respect must have been failure adequately
to inform members of
the possible importance or materiality of the membership rights.  Thirdly, it
must be asked what the members
should have been told about the possible
importance or materiality.  
<P>

67	It is here that I respectfully have some difficulty with the reasons of the
Full Court.  The materiality and importance was not
a monetary value of the
membership rights, because it was accepted that it may be impossible to place a
monetary value on them. 
What, then, should members have been told?
<P>

68	From the concluding sentences in the passage from the judgment of the Full
Court first set out, the materiality and importance
may have been that the
rights gave control to members if, thinking the existing structure and whatever
benefits it brought material
and important, they wished to continue that
structure and those benefits.  Why was it misleading not to inform members of
their right
of control?  The general meeting of Association was an exercise of
the control, and members can not have been ignorant of it.  
<P>

69	Alternatively, from the same concluding sentences the materiality and
importance may have been that insufficient information
was given for members to
determine the materiality and importance of the continuation of the benefits,
that is, insufficient information
as to the respective advantages and
disadvantages of the existing structure and a demutualised NRMA, so that they
could value (although
not in monetary terms) the membership rights.  This view
is supported by the concluding sentences of the passage from the judgment
of
the Full Court secondly set out (although the last sentence elevates the rights
to be surrendered to significant and material
rights, no longer rights of
possible materiality and importance).  If this be the correct view of their
Honour's reasons, the free
shares question merges in, and becomes a consequence
of, the disadvantages question.  In short, it was held that it was misleading
to describe the shares to be issued by Holdings as free shares because there
might have been disadvantages in the proposal not sufficiently
identified and
elaborated in the prospectus.  
<P>

70	For the disadvantages question, it can be seen that the reasoning of the
Full Court was that, although the prospectus conveyed
the recommendations that
members would be better off under the proposed restructure, it stated that
there were disadvantages but
did not identify and inform members about
("explain or compare with the perceived advantages") the disadvantages, and
that this involved
contravention of s 52 of the TP Act because the members
might think that the unidentified disadvantages "must be ones that they would
not treat as significant in relation to the rights being given up and the new
rights to be acquired in a publicly listed company".
 
<P>

71	This reasoning directed attention to the unidentified disadvantages, and the
judgment can be read in two ways.  From the concluding
paragraph in the passage
from the judgment secondly set out, the disadvantages were the disadvantages of
which the directors making
the recommendation were aware - those which were
said to exist but were not identified.  If so, the disadvantages non-disclosure
of which underpinned the misleading conduct were not, or not necessarily, those
in the summary of the applicants' submission plus
the consideration added by
the Court (see the second paragraph of the passage).  The Court considered that
there must have been disadvantages,
because the prospectus said so, but itself
did not identify or make findings as to disadvantages which should have been
identified,
explained, and compared with advantages but were not so dealt with.

<P>

72	Alternatively, from earlier paragraphs in the passage the disadvantages were
those in the summary of the applicants' submission
plus the consideration added
by the Court, and as well any other disadvantages of which the directors were
aware.  But even then
the Court made no findings as to the existence of the
disadvantages, saying only that the members should have brought to their
attention
matters of that kind and proceeding on the basis that there must have
been disadvantages.  
<P>

73	Again, I respectfully have some difficulty with the reasons of the Full
Court.  Disadvantages were identified and explained in
the prospectus,
sometimes indirectly (for example, describing the preservation of the NRMA's
consumer and service activities involved
recognising, and countering, a
disadvantage) but also directly (especially under Members' Questions).  If the
judgment be read in
the first way set out above, it involved an assumption,
rather than a finding, that there were disadvantages of the kind in the summary
of the applicants' submission plus the consideration added by the Court, and by
reference to the "Doing nothing" option the conclusion
that there was no
meaningful statement of the disadvantages.  So in the end the vice in relation
to disadvantages on which the Full
Court acted was not that particular
disadvantages existed but were not identified, explained, and compared with
perceived advantages,
but that possible disadvantages might have been
significant in relation to the exchange of rights, but members might have been
led
to think that they could not be significant:  see the last paragraph in the
passage secondly set out.  
<P>

74	That the Full Court did not go beyond possible disadvantages is supported by
regard to the disadvantages to which it referred.
 Their Honours seem to have
taken the class as the likelihood of change in the future conduct of the
undertaking of the NRMA:  see
the opening words of the passage secondly set
out.  Six disadvantages were then postulated, (i) to (v) from the applicants'
submissions
and a further consideration added by the Court.  The part of the
prospectus addressed for the statement of disadvantages was that
part under the
heading "Other Options".  There were grounds for concluding that the
disadvantages to which it referred were not disadvantages
requiring
identification, or were disadvantages sufficiently identified and explained in
the prospectus.  The grounds were as follows,
but were not considered by the
Court:  so the disadvantages were left as possible disadvantages.
<P>

75	As to (i), that the proposed restructure involved a change in status and
membership, the change was referred to more than once,
particularly in the
notices of meeting - it was, after all, what the general meetings were about.

<P>

76	As to (ii), that shareholders in a listed company would have different
rights and expectations as shareholders, particularly
in relation to profit,
the substance of the disadvantage was recognised, and countered, in the fifth
Members' Question asking whether,
with shareholders, the NRMA would pursue
profit at the expense of service.
<P>

77	As to (iii), to the effect that the directors of a company with shareholders
would look to profits and payment of dividends when
directors of a mutual
organisation would not, the substance of the disadvantage was recognised, and
countered, in the fourth Members'
Question asking whether the NRMA would change
its culture and in the fifth Members' Question.  The Full Court observed, in
relation
to abandonment of the culture, that the commercial reasons why the
culture of the NRMA would continue was a matter of opinion for
the judgment of
the members, but the possible disadvantage was there for the members to
consider.
<P>

78	As to (iv), that Holdings would have the capacity to change the operation by
selling its assets or undertaking, so also would
Association and Insurance -
that the restructuring would bring a change other than via a change in
profit-seeking was not evident.
<P>

79	As to (v), that in the long term there might be a takeover or minority
control via strategic holdings, the substance of the disadvantage
was
recognised, and partially countered, in the sixth Members' Question asking
whether the NRMA could be taken over if it issued
shares.  The likely
effectiveness of the protection against takeover - also in part protection
against minority control - was a matter
for members;  the possible disadvantage
was there for the members to consider.
<P>

80	As to the consideration added by the Court, that with time the composition
of the boards would change and future boards would
not be bound by statements
of intention by the present boards, it would be the same for Association and
Insurance too;  the stress
on continuation of the NRMA's culture flagged for
members the possibility of a change in direction if future management so chose,
but there could be the change anyway.
<P>

81	Regard to the disadvantages to which the Full Court referred does not
establish that there was meaningful disclosure of disadvantages,
but it
underlines that information as to the proposal was held to be misleading not
because there were, but because there might have
been, disadvantages in the
proposal not sufficiently identified and elaborated in the prospectus.  The
disadvantages question merged
with the free shares question.  And so my
respectful difficulties with the reasons of the Full Court increase.  How can
it be said
that a prospectus is misleading because it has the potential to lead
members to think that unidentified disadvantages must be ones
they would not
treat as significant, unless the existence and significance of the postulated
disadvantages is established?  Assumption
of the disadvantages is not enough,
and assessment of their significance is required.  
<P>

82	To return to the course of the Federal Court proceedings, at the conclusion
of its reasons the Full Court observed that it might
be that the respondents
would wish to amend or supplement the prospectus, and that it "would endorse
the observation of Gummow J
that it might not be practicable and might be
unwise for the Court to undertake the supervision, with the suggestion of its
imprimatur,
of the dissemination of `corrective' material".  As earlier noted,
the order of Gummow J restraining distribution of the prospectus
and the
onsert was not expressed to be subject to the leave of the Court.  On
30 January 1995 the Full Court heard argument on the
terms of the orders
it should make, the submissions and the result appearing from the following
passage from the reasons then given
(<i>NRMA Holdings Ltd v Fraser</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
55 FCR 489</a> at 489-90) -
<P>

"Mr Garnsey QC for the respondents to the appeal, submitted that for a number
of reasons none of the orders should be disturbed
and in particular that no
order should be made that could result in any further distribution of the
prospectus, whether accompanied
by a supplementary prospectus, other
explanatory or correcting matter, or otherwise. His primary contention was that
no correction
could possibly overcome the deficiencies in the prospectus.
<P>

Mr Bennett QC for the appellants, on the other hand, submitted that the
deficiencies, as identified in our reasons for judgment,
could be overcome by
an appropriate document and he sought an order that would allow the original
prospectus to be distributed if
the ASC so required consequent upon a
supplementary prospectus being lodged with it.
<P>

Although we have concluded that the distribution of Exs A, B and C did involve
conduct in contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> 1974</a>
(Cth) we have reached that conclusion on a more limited basis than the trial
judge. We are not persuaded that it would be impossible
to correct the
contravening effect of those documents, although this is not, of course, to be
taken as a positive finding that correction
is possible. If it were sought to
correct the prospectus and the other documents and the matter came before the
Court the question
would have to be decided in the light of the evidence then
before the Court, including the precise terms of the correcting material
and
all other relevant circumstances. Those circumstances might include the effect
of past advertising and any proposed future advertising.
We did not think it
appropriate in these circumstances to deny to the appellants the opportunity of
seeking to persuade the Court,
should they wish to avail themselves of it, that
it should grant leave to distribute Exs A, B and C or any of them, in
conjunction
with correcting material.
<P>

Mr Bennett submitted that there should be provisos to orders (1), (2) and
(3) which would have the practical effect of allowing
the appellants to proceed
with the business of the general meeting once a supplementary prospectus had
been lodged with the ASC subject
only to the requirements of the ASC, and
without further order of the Court. In our opinion, whilst this course might
have attractions
in other circumstances, we do not consider that it should be
taken when there are other unresolved challenges to the validity of
the
decisions made by the boards of the second and third named appellants pending
in relation to the proposal.
<P>

Mr Bennett submitted that we should only concern ourselves with the discrete
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> issue but we consider that the resolution of the
issues outstanding between the parties in this Court may affect the discretion
to
grant or not to grant leave to send out further material, if such leave were
sought, or to proceed with the meetings. The Court should
also take into
account the desirability that all issues be resolved as expeditiously as
possible, and in one forum."
<P>

Hence the variation to the orders of Gummow J, whereby the restraint on
distributing the prospectus and the onsert was subject to
the leave of the
Court.  
<P>

<b><i>Gambotto's case</i></b>
<P>

83	WCP Ltd had passed a special resolution for the amendment of its articles,
adding article 20A the effect of which was to enable
a shareholder entitled to
hold 90 per cent or more of the issued shares to acquire compulsorily
shares held by minority shareholders
for a stated price per share.  At least in
the two lower courts, it was accepted that the stated price was independently
arrived
at and fair, and there would have been considerable taxation and
administrative benefits for the company if it had become a wholly
owned
subsidiary of the holding company of the majority shareholders.  The majority
shareholders did not vote upon the special resolution,
which was passed upon
the votes of minority shareholders other than Mr Gambotto and
Ms Sandri.  Mr Gambotto and Ms Sandri contended
that the
amendment was invalid, arguing that it was oppressive to them in that it
permitted their shares to be expropriated by the
majority shareholders. 
<P>

84	The invalidity was upheld at first instance (<i>Gambotto v WCP Ltd</i>
(1992) 8 ACSR 141).  McLelland J said (at 143) that the exercise of the
power to alter articles was constrained by principles of
equity, but that the
commonly stated test of bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole was
ambiguous and often unhelpful,
and that it "has not been found possible to
define in any precise way the grounds upon which an ostensible exercise of the
power
should be considered invalid".  He accepted that it would be advantageous
to WCP Ltd if it were to become a wholly owned subsidiary
of the holding
company of the majority shareholders, and said that he would consider "the
question of principle on the notional footing
that the purpose of the amendment
was to achieve the advantages to WCP indicated above".  His Honour then said
(at 144) -
<P>

"The immediate purpose and effect of the amendment was to permit the shares of
the minority shareholders to be expropriated by the
majority shareholders. In
my opinion such an amendment amounts to unjust oppression of those minority
shareholders who object ....
There are three reported English decisions in
which the validity of an alteration of articles of association of a company to
effect
or permit expropriation of shares of a minority has been considered.
[His Honour then referred to the decisions.]  In each case the
criterion sought
to be applied was `bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole'. For
the reasons already indicated, that
is an inadequate criterion in a case of
this kind, and its inadequacy is I think illustrated by a consideration of the
judgments
given in those three cases. 
<P>

It is to be observed that if a majority holding or controlling 75% or more of
the issued capital of a company could validly expropriate
the shares of a
minority by an alteration to the articles for reasons of the kind advanced in
this case, it would be unnecessary
to have such provisions for compulsory
acquisition of shares of dissenting minorities as are to be found in ss 414 and
701 of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

For the above reasons, the amendment to the articles of WCP purportedly made at
the meeting of 11 May 1992 was in my opinion invalid
and ineffective."
<P>

85	On appeal to the Court of Appeal it was held that the amendment was not
oppressive and was effective (<i>WCP Ltd v Gambotto</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 385).</a>
The appeal was heard on 4 March 1993 and the decision was given on 7 May
1993.
<P>

86	The principal judgment was that of Meagher JA, with whom Cripps JA
agreed.  His Honour observed that the words "bona fide and
for the benefit of
the company as a whole" had "beguiled and confused the courts" ever since they
were first used in 1900, and his
reasons for upholding the appeal were (at
389) -
<P>

"In the present case the evidence demonstrated, and the judge accepted, that
there would be enormous taxation advantages for the
company if the minority
shares were expropriated, and that there would be considerable administrative
savings if such an expropriation
took place. Nor was it alleged that the
compensation provisions were inadequate. Just why the court should interfere
and why his
Honour in fact did so, I cannot see.
<P>

As I have pointed out, his Honour's view is consistent with, and only with,
some notion that an expropriation of shares whether
beneficial for the company
or not is a malum in se and as such always enjoinable. His Honour could not
have held that the resolution
in question was `so extravagant that no
reasonable person could believe that it was for the benefit of the company' (to
quote the
test of Latham CJ in <i>Peters' American Delicacy Co Ltd v
Heath</i> (at 482); indeed, he specifically held to the contrary.
<P>

It can hardly be contended that all powers of expropriation are repugnant to
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. The legislation in terms permits expropriations in
s 701 to s 702 (take over schemes), s 411 (compromises) and
s 414 (schemes of
arrangement). Nor, in my opinion, could it reasonably be
contended that these provisions constitute some sort of code governing the
expropriation of shares. If the company's articles had contained an art 20A
when it was incorporated, it is difficult to see how
anyone could object to it.
Moreover, articles of association regularly provide for liens leading to
forfeiture, and this involves
an expropriation of property. Further, the
decisions in cases like <i>Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa, Ltd</i> and
<i>Sidebottom v Kershaw, Leese and Co, Ltd</i> both involved expropriations
which were sanctioned by the courts of England and those cases have been
approved by the courts of Australia.
<P>

For these reasons I am of the view that the appeal must succeed  in so far as
it challenges his Honour's view, which I have set
out, that the expropriation
was invalid."
<P>

87	Priestley JA agreed in the result.  His Honour's reasons were (at
386-7) -
<P>

"Shares are a form of property, and, often, expropriation of property, that is,
the divesting of property from an owner without
that owner's consent, will
attract community opinion that the divestment was oppressive and/or unjust. The
present case does not
strike me as one to which that opinion applies.
<P>

For one thing, that opinion is frequently <u>not</u> applicable where the
divesting is accompanied by just compensation (as is undisputedly the case
here). For another, a person acquiring
the shares in question in the present
case either knew, or should have known that the company (in the original sense)
consisted of
members who each agreed, by the fact of membership, to be bound by
duly passed resolutions of members of the company at general meeting.
Any
divestment pursuant to, or  dependent on, such a resolution, is, in a real
sense, not a divestment against the shareholder's
will; although the
shareholder might vote against a particular resolution, and so not consent to
its consequences at that point,
the shareholder has nevertheless voluntarily
become a member of a group of shareholders, binding themselves together by
rules by
which they agree to be bound by duly passed resolutions even if
individual shareholders disagree with them. There are of course abuses
of these
rules from time to time by members with sufficient voting power; these abuses
may be checked by the courts, if the statutory
provisions are insufficient. I
can see no sign of any such abuse in the present case. The property in the
shares now in question
does not seem to have, or to call for, the kind of
inalienability against their holders' will which the respondents' claim
involves."
<P>

88	The NRMA's allegations of fault on the part of the lawyers in the area of
the new structure and the steps to achieve it make
appropriate some
observations about <i>Gambotto's case</i> to this point.  
<P>

89	It was concerned with shares in a company limited by shares, and with
compulsory acquisition ("expropriation") of shares by a
change in articles.
The power to change the articles was not in doubt, and the question was whether
the exercise of the power was
constrained.  Both McLelland J and the Court of
Appeal found unhelpful the test of constraint according to exercise of the
power
bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole.  
<P>

90	McLelland J did not provide an alternative test, going directly to the
conclusion that there was oppression:  it seems that the
fact of expropriation
was enough to constitute oppression.  The Court of Appeal did not provide an
alternative test, but considered
that the fact of expropriation was not enough
to constitute oppression.  Because the stated price was fair and the
expropriation
was for the benefit of the company as a whole, greater
exploration of what might constitute oppression (or an abuse of the power,
as
Priestley JA described it) in an expropriation of shares was unnecessary.  
<P>

91	<i>Gambotto's case</i> stood for the proposition that the exercise of the
power to change the articles of a company to provide for the majority
shareholders
to compulsorily acquire the shares of the minority was not
oppressive because there was an expropriation of shares, at least provided
that
the acquisition was on fair terms.  If the expropriation was fair, the fact of
expropriation would not make the exercise of
the power invalid.
<P>

92	On 10 December 1993 the High Court granted special leave to appeal from
the decision of the Court of Appeal, and the appeal was
heard on 21 April
1994.  The dates are important in these proceedings, because they were during
the development of the proposal.
<P>

93	In the decision delivered on 8 March 1995 the High Court upheld the appeal.
The principal judgment was the joint judgment of
Mason CJ and Brennan,
Deane and Dawson JJ, and McHugh J delivered a separate judgment.
<P>

94	In the joint judgment the matter of principle was described (at
439) -
<P>

"The fundamental issue in this case is whether, and if so in what
circumstances, the taking of a power by majority shareholders
by amendment to
the articles to acquire compulsorily the shares of the minority shareholders
will be held invalid on the basis that
it is oppressive."
<P>

After discussion of the authorities, it was said (at 444-448) -
<P>

"<u>Striking a balance</u>
<P>

The foregoing analysis of the authorities reveals that the courts have
struggled to strike a balance between the interests of the
majority and the
minority. On the one hand, the courts have recognized that the proprietary
rights attaching to shares are subject
to modification, even destruction, by a
special resolution altering the articles and that the power to vote is
exercisable by a shareholder
to his or her own advantage. On the other hand,
the courts have acknowledged that the power to alter the articles should not be
exercised
simply for the purpose of securing some personal gain which does not
arise out of the contemplated objects of the power. The problem
of stating a
workable criterion arises, as Dixon J said in <i>Peters</i>, `in attempting to
discover and fasten upon some element the presence of which will always vitiate
a resolution for the alteration
of articles of association'.
<P>

<u>The test for determining whether an expropriation is valid</u>
<P>

In the context of a special resolution altering the articles and giving rise to
a conflict of interests and advantages, whether
or not it involves an
expropriation of shares, we would reject as inappropriate the `bona fide for
the benefit of the company as
a whole' test of Lindley MR in <i>Allen v Gold
Reefs of West Africa Ltd</i>. The application of the test in such a context has
been criticised on grounds which, in our view, are unanswerable. It seems to us
that, in such a case not involving an actual or effective expropriation of
shares or of valuable proprietary rights attaching to
shares, an alteration of
the articles by special resolution regularly passed will be valid unless it is
ultra vires, beyond any purpose
contemplated by the articles or oppressive as
that expression is understood in the law relating to corporations. Somewhat
different
considerations apply, however, in a case such as the present where
what is involved is an alteration of the articles to allow an
expropriation by
the majority of the shares, or of valuable proprietary rights attaching to the
shares, of a minority. In such a
case, the immediate purpose of the resolution
is to confer upon the majority shareholder or shareholders power to acquire
compulsorily
the property of the minority shareholder or shareholders. Of
itself, the conferral of such a power does not lie within the `contemplated
objects of the power' to amend the articles.
<P>

The exercise of a power conferred by a company's constitution enabling the
majority shareholders to expropriate the minority's shareholding
for the
purpose of aggrandizing the majority is valid if and only to the extent that
the relevant provisions of the company's constitution
so provide. The inclusion
of such a power in a company's constitution at its incorporation is one thing.
But it is another thing
when a company's constitution is sought to be amended
by an alteration of articles of association so as to confer upon the majority
power to expropriate the shares of a minority. Such a power could not be taken
or exercised simply for the purpose of aggrandizing
the majority. In our view,
such a power can be taken only if (i) it is exercisable for a proper purpose
and (ii) its exercise will
not operate oppressively in relation to minority
shareholders. In other words, an expropriation may be justified where it is
reasonably
apprehended that the continued shareholding of the minority is
detrimental to the company, its undertaking or the conduct of its
affairs -
resulting in detriment to the interests of the existing shareholders generally
- and expropriation is a reasonable means
of eliminating or mitigating that
detriment.
<P>

Accordingly, if it appears that the substantial purpose of the alteration is to
secure the company from significant detriment or
harm, the alteration would be
valid if it is not oppressive to the minority shareholders. So, expropriation
would be justified in
the case of a shareholder who is competing with the
company as was the case in <i>Sidebottom v Kershaw, Leese &amp; Co</i>, so long
as the terms of expropriation are not oppressive. Again, expropriation of a
minority shareholder could be justified if it
were necessary in order to ensure
that the company could continue to comply with a regulatory regime governing
the principal business
which it carried on. To take a hypothetical example: if
the conduct of a television station were the undertaking of a company and
a
renewal of a television licence under a statute depended upon the licensee's
entire share capital being held by Australian residents,
the expropriation of
foreign shareholders who are unwilling to sell their shares to Australian
residents might be justified assuming
it is fair in all the circumstances. But
that is not to say that the majority can expropriate the minority merely in
order to secure
for themselves the benefit of a corporate structure that can
derive some new commercial advantage by virtue of the expropriation.
<P>

Notwithstanding that a shareholder's membership of a company is subject to
alterations of the articles which may affect the rights
attaching to the
shareholder's shares and the value of those shares, we do not consider that, in
the case of an alteration to the
articles authorizing the expropriation of
shares, it is a sufficient justification of an expropriation that the
expropriation, being
fair, will advance the interests of the company as a legal
and commercial entity or those of the majority, albeit the great majority,
of
corporators. This approach does not attach sufficient weight to the proprietary
nature of a share and, to the extent that English
authority might appear to
support such an approach, we do not agree with it. It is only right that
exceptional circumstances should
be required to justify an amendment to the
articles authorizing the compulsory expropriation by the majority of the
minority's interests
in a company. To allow expropriation where it would
advance the interests of the company as a legal and commercial entity or those
of the general body of corporators would, in our view, be tantamount to
permitting expropriation by the majority for the purpose
of some personal gain
and thus be made for an improper purpose. It would open the way to
circumventing the protection which the <i>Corporations Law</i> give to
minorities who resist compromises, amalgamations and reconstructions, schemes
of arrangement and takeover offers.
<P>

As noted in the preceding paragraphs, an alteration to the company's articles
permitting the expropriation of shares will not be
valid simply because it was
made for a proper purpose; it must also be fair in the circumstances. Fairness
in this context has both
procedural and substantive elements. The first
element, that the process used to expropriate must be fair, require the
majority shareholders
to disclose all relevant information leading up to the
alteration and it presumably requires the shares to be valued by an independent
expert. Whether it also requires the majority shareholders to refrain from
voting on the proposed amendment is a question that is
best left open at this
stage.
<P>

The second element, that the expropriation itself must be fair, is largely
concerned with the price offered for the shares. Thus,
an expropriation at less
than market value is prima facie unfair, and it would be unusual for a court to
be satisfied that a price
substantially above market value  was not a fair
value. That said, it is important to emphasize that a shareholder's interest
cannot
be valued solely by the current market value of the shares. Whether the
price offered is fair depends on a variety of factors, including
assets, market
value, dividends, and the nature of the corporation and its likely future.
<P>

<u>Onus</u>
<P>

The respondents' submissions, which are based heavily on <i>Peters</i>, are
premised on the proposition that an alteration allowing an expropriation is
prima facie valid. It is conceded that the suggested
presumption of validity
will be rebutted if the minority shareholder proves either that the alteration
was made for an improper purpose
or that it is oppressive to that particular
shareholder. Nonetheless, the respondents' approach, which forces the minority
shareholder
to shoulder a heavy onus of proof, tilts the balance too far in
favour of commercial expediency and fails to attach sufficient weight
to the
proprietary nature of a share. A share is liable to modification or destruction
in appropriate circumstances, but is more
than a `capitalized dividend stream':
it is a form of investment that confers proprietary rights on the investor.
Accordingly, in
the case of expropriation, we consider that the onus lies on
those supporting expropriation to show that the power is validly exercised.
<P>

It is for the majority to prove that the alteration is valid because it was
made for a proper purpose and is fair in all the circumstances.
This approach
ensures that the application of the relevant principle does not unduly favour
the majority and it largely alleviates
the sting of practical difficulties,
such as poor access to information, that would otherwise confront minority
shareholders.
<P>

<u>The validity of art 20A</u>
<P>

As the appellants did not contend that the expropriation was not fair in the
sense explained above, the validity of art 20A hinges
on whether the
respondents have proved that the amendment was not made for a proper purpose
[sic: was made for a proper purpose?]
The immediate purpose of the amendment
was to allow the expropriation by the majority shareholder of the shares held
by the minority,
including the shares held by the appellants. There is no
suggestion that the appellants' continued presence as members puts WCP's
business activities at risk or that the appellants have in some way acted to
WCP's detriment. Nor is there any suggestion that WCP
sought 100 per cent
ownership in order to comply with a regulatory regime. All that is suggested is
that taxation advantages and
administrative benefits would flow to WCP if
minority shareholdings were expropriated and WCP were to become a wholly-owned
subsidiary
of LEL. In our view, however, that cannot by itself constitute a
proper purpose for a resolution altering the articles to allow for
the
expropriation of a minority shareholder's shares. In that regard, it is not
irrelevant to note that it is difficult to conceive
of circumstances in which
financial and administrative benefits would not be a consequence of the
expropriation of minority shareholdings
by a majority shareholder.
<P>

Accordingly, we would hold art 20A invalid and ineffective on the basis that it
was not made for a proper purpose."
<P>

95	McHugh J stated the question in the appeal (at 449) as whether the
resolution adding the article "was invalid because its passing
was oppressive
of minority shareholders".  After discussion of the test of  benefit of the
company as a whole, including observations
to the effect that it is not always
a satisfactory test for determining whether a proposed alteration of the
articles of the company
is valid, his Honour said (at 453) -
<P>

"In my opinion, a company may alter its articles of association for the purpose
of enabling a shareholder to acquire the shares
of existing shareholders only
when the acquisition is necessary to protect or promote the interests of the
company and when the alteration
will not be oppressive to those shareholders.
In the absence of statutory authorization, a general contractual power to alter
the
articles of a company would not authorize an amendment empowering the
compulsory acquisition of a member's shares. `[C]lear judicial
authority, clear
legislation or clear principle and necessity would seem to be required' before
a general power to alter the articles
of a company could be construed  as
authorizing such a far reaching alteration. The power to alter the articles of
association of
a company, however, does not depend upon contract. It is, and
long has been, authorized by statute. But, wide though that power is,
its
application is, as I have indicated, subject to restrictions. One of them is
that it does not extend to an alteration whose purpose
is to expropriate the
shares of an existing shareholder unless the expropriation is necessary for the
protection or promotion of
the company's interests."
<P>

96	After further consideration of the statutory power to alter articles and
some authorities, his Honour said (at 455-7) -
<P>

"Although, for the reasons that I have given, the generality of the power does
not authorize an alteration providing for the expropriation
of a member's
shares by majority vote, no reason exists for holding that the power does not
extend to those alterations that are
necessary to protect or promote the
company's interests. Thus, alteration for the purpose of expropriating a
member's shares may
be permissible if it is necessary to protect the company
against direct competition from a member or from a company of which the
member
is a director. Similarly, alteration for the purpose of expropriation may be
permissible if the character or status of a member
will cause harm to the
company or prevent it from pursuing a legitimate commercial interest.
<P>

No distinction should be drawn between an expropriation that will enable a
company to pursue a beneficial course of action that
would otherwise be denied
to it and an expropriation that avoids a detriment to the existing interests of
the company. I see no difference
between an expropriation that will enable a
company to renew an existing licence to do something and an expropriation that
will allow
the company to acquire that kind of licence. Nor in a case like the
present, can I see a valid distinction in principle between an
expropriation
that would allow a company to escape the incidence of a particular tax and an
expropriation that would allow the company
to reduce its potential tax
liability. In both cases, the proper conclusion is that the expropriation is
commercially necessary to
protect the assets of the company. That does not mean
that an expropriation will be valid whenever the expropriation will financially
benefit the company. Independently of any question of oppression, the
alteration of articles for the purpose expropriating a member's
shares will be
valid only if it will enable the company to pursue some significant goal, or to
protect itself from some action, that
is external to the company.
Administrative convenience or cost, for example, could never by itself justify
an alteration for the
purpose of expropriation.
<P>

<u>Oppression</u>
<P>

Moreover, the fact that an expropriation is necessary for the protection or
promotion of the company does not prevent it from being
oppressive to the
shareholders whose shares will be acquired. When the articles of association
contain no power to expropriate the
shares of a member of the company, any
resolution granting such a power is prima facie oppressive to those
shareholders who do not
wish to sell their shares. In the absence of an article
authorizing the expropriation of member's shares, members have a legitimate
expectation that, unless some exceptional circumstance should arise they will
be able to retain their shares until they wish to sell
or until the company is
wound up. Once the articles are altered to give the power of expropriation to
the directors or the majority
shareholders, a shareholder whose shares are
liable to be expropriated is placed in the position where he or she can be
forced to
accept cash or debt in exchange for the shares while the majority
retain their shareholding. Any benefits that will flow to the company
from the
acquisition will flow only to the remaining shareholders. Furthermore, those
given the power to acquire are usually not
bound to exercise their power.
Often, the expropriators can time the acquisition to suit their own convenience
and purposes. In periods
such as that which followed the stock market `crash'
of October 1987, the price of shares may be artificially depressed giving the
expropriators the chance to acquire the shares at a price below their
`fundamental value'. Usually, the expropriator is a person
who controls the
company and who often has access to information that is denied to other
shareholders and to the stock market.
<P>

Under these circumstances, to require shareholders to sell their shares against
their will is an infringement of their rights as
autonomous beings to make
their own decision and to carry out their own actions. In a society being free
and equal agents any interference
with the autonomy of any individual needs to
be justified if it is not to be regarded as oppressive. Because those proposing
an alteration
for the purpose of expropriation must justify their action, the
onus must be on them to establish that there has been no oppression.
<P>

To prevent an alteration for the purpose of an expropriation being oppressive
the expropriators will need to act fairly. In a leading
American case,
<i>Weinberger v UOP Inc</i>, the Supreme Court of Delaware, in dealing with a
statute that enabled a corporation that was a majority shareholder in another
corporation
to buy out the minority shareholders and merge the two
corporations, pointed out that the `concept of fairness has two basic aspects:
fair dealing and fair price'."
<P>

97	After expanding on fair dealing and fair price, his Honour concluded (at
459-60) -
<P>

"<u>The present case</u>
<P>

In the present case, the principal goal sought to be achieved by the alteration
was in my view a legitimate business objective and
one that would justify the
expropriation of each appellant's shares provided that it was otherwise fair to
<u>that</u> person. The alteration of the articles and the expropriation of the
minority shares would enable the company to save over $4 million
in taxes.
<P>

In my opinion, however, the company has failed to prove that the expropriation
was not oppressive. It is true that upon the evidence
before the Court and
having regard to the concessions of the appellants the price of $1.365 per
share may well have been a fair price
for the shares, but the onus is on the
company to prove that the price was fair, that the appellants have been dealt
with fairly
and that a full disclosure of all matters in relation to the
alteration and expropriation has been made. The evidence falls far short
of
proving that the company and the majority shareholders have dealt with each
appellant fairly. Almost no attempt was made to make
the full disclosure that
is required in this class of case.
<P>

It follows that the resolution adopting art 20A was invalid. The appeal should
be allowed."
<P>

98	It will be necessary to return to the effect of the decision of the High
Court, but this much can presently be said.  The power
to change the articles
seems still to have been accepted, and the question was still whether the
exercise of the power was constrained
(although McHugh J seems rather to have
read down the power).  A new test was established for a change in articles to
provide for
expropriation of shares, with two limbs:  that the expropriation be
for a proper purpose, and that the expropriation not be oppressive
to the
minority.  The first limb underlined that inquiry in terms of oppression, which
was equated with fairness, was not sufficient,
and that there was an additional
requirement of proper purpose, and proper purpose was not satisfied by benefit
to the company as
a whole but called for something more by way of securing the
company from significant detriment or harm.  The fact of expropriation
would
make the exercise of power invalid, even if the expropriation was fair, unless
the majority shareholders could prove the proper
purpose.
<P>

<center><b>III  THE NRMA'S CLAIMS</b></center>
<P>

99	The plaintiffs in the proceedings were Association, Insurance, and Holdings.
The first defendants were the partners at the time
of AAH.  The second
defendants were the partners at the time of AT.  The third defendant was Mr
Heydon.  The allegations of fault
on the part of the defendants centred upon
the free shares question, the disadvantages question, and the impact of
<i>Gambotto's</i> <i>case</i> on the proposal.  In brief, it was alleged that
the defendants were at fault in failing adequately to advise the NRMA in
relation
to risk to the proposal in connection with <i>Gambotto's case</i>, in
relation to the free shares question, or in relation to the disadvantages
question, and that if the NRMA had been adequately
advised it would not have
suffered loss of the wasted expenditure - as to risk in connection with
<i>Gambotto's case</i> most of the wasted expenditure, and as to the free
shares question and the disadvantages question the whole of the wasted
expenditure.
 On the NRMA's case, had it been told of risk to the proposal in
connection with <i>Gambotto's case</i>, it would have deferred the proposal
until the decision of the High Court and following that decision would not have
proceeded with
it at all in the form then determined, so the expenditure from
the time of deferral would not have been incurred;  if it had proceeded
with
the proposal, then had it been adequately advised in relation to the free
shares question and the disadvantages question it
would have done so in a way
not open to the successful challenge in the Federal Court, and the whole of the
expenditure would not
have been wasted.  There was, of course, much more to the
NRMA's case than in this brief summary, and the detail will come as these
reasons unfold.  
<P>

100	The claims against the defendants, as ultimately set out in points of claim
filed on 25 May 1988, were framed on a number of
different causes of
action.  They may be identified as claims for (a) breach of contract;  (b)
negligence;  (c) contravention of
s 52 of the TP Act or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>");  (d) involvement in
Holdings' contravention of the TP Act or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>;  (e) contravention of
s 995(2) of the Law;  and (f) contravention of s 996(1) of the
Law.
<P>

<b>Breach of contract</b>
<P>

101	AAH and AT were retained by the NRMA, and it was common ground that under
the contracts thereby formed they owed to the NRMA
duties to exercise
reasonable care, skill and diligence ("duties of care") in the matters for
which they were retained.  In the manner
the proceedings were conducted, the
parties said that it did not matter whether the solicitors were retained by
Association, by Insurance,
or by both, or whether the retainer extended to a
retainer by Holdings when Holdings was incorporated.  
<P>

102	Such letters as there were dealing with the retainers addressed fees,
resources, and such like, and did not add to, cut down,
or give content to the
duties of care, and there was a degree of contention over the scope of the
matters for which the solicitors
were retained.  In the result, in the
respective submissions there was little issue over the existence of duties of
care sufficient
for the failures to exercise reasonable care, skill and
diligence on which the NRMA relied.  It is enough to record that the NRMA
alleged in the points of claim, but AAH and AT did not accept in their
defences, that the matters for which each of AAH and AT was
retained were such
that the duties of care included the exercise of reasonable care, skill and
diligence in proffering timely and
accurate advice to the NRMA generally in
connection with all legal issues arising out of the proposal;  in preparing,
advising upon
and settling the prospectus;  in ensuring that the prospectus did
not contain any misleading, incorrect or incomplete information,
statement or
representation;  in ensuring that the prospectus disclosed all information
which was necessary to make the prospectus
true and not misleading;  in
ensuring that the prospectus contained information that was fair and balanced;
in ensuring that the
proposal was lawful and capable of implementation;  and in
proffering timely and accurate advice to the NRMA of any risk that the
proposal
could be rendered unlawful.
<P>

103	The points of claim could probably be read as including a claim for breach
of contract (as distinct from negligence) against
Mr Heydon.  Such a claim was
espoused even to and in submissions, but at a late stage was expressly
abandoned.
<P>

104	It was alleged that AAH and AT breached the contracts in that they failed
to exercise the reasonable care, skill and diligence,
with lengthy particulars
of the failures.  In the hearing of the proceedings the prolixity of the
particulars was not taken up, and
more concise and confined submissions of
failures to exercise the reasonable care, skill and diligence were made.  The
thrust of
the failures alleged in submissions, to which I will come in due
course, was that AAH and AT should have advised that there was a
real risk that
the proposal as then determined could be rendered unlawful by the decision of
the High Court on a successful appeal
in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and should
have advised against describing the shares as free shares at all, or at least
of the risk of using that description as
it was used.  As the NRMA's case was
put in submissions, inadequate advice in relation to the disadvantages question
took a subsidiary
role, being that the prospectus' failure to explain the
disadvantages "compounded the misleading representation that the members
were
giving up nothing of value in exchange for free shares".  
<P>

105	It was then alleged that in consequence of the breaches of contract the
NRMA suffered loss in the amount of the wasted expenditure.
 In the points of
claim the loss on this cause of action, and all others, was claimed globally,
as the entire wasted expenditure.
 In its opening the NRMA made clear that the
loss claimed for failure to advise of risk to the proposal in connection with
<i>Gambotto's case</i> was only the expenditure after the date on which the
advice should have been given and would have been acted on, putting forward
alternative dates in March and April 1994.  In the course of submissions it
said that it was arguable that the prior expenditure
"was lost as a result of
the Gambotto negligence", but confirmed that it was content to start from the
intermediate date.  As to
the loss claimed for failure to advise in relation to
the free shares question and the disadvantages question, in submissions there
was late modification by the NRMA to a claim that part of the wasted
expenditure would be recoverable as such if it succeeded in
establishing the
defendants' liability and other of the wasted expenditure would be recoverable
on a different basis.  Until that
time the NRMA's case on all causes of action
going to free shares/disadvantages liability was that it either succeeded or
failed
in relation to the entire wasted expenditure, and I will further explain
the shift from a global claim of loss in due course.
<P>

<b>Negligence</b>
<P>

106	It was also common ground that the retainers of AAH and AT gave rise to
duties of care under common law principles relating
to negligence apart from
under the contracts thereby formed (see for example <i>Hawkins v Clayton</i>
(1964) 164 CLR 539 at 574-5 per Deane J;  <i>Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 642)</a>, the duties of care having the same content as the duties
of care under the contracts.  In the points of claim the NRMA alleged breach
of
the duties of care and loss in the same respects as for the claims for breach
of contract.  No one submitted that the liability
of AAH or AT, or the
quantification of damages, differed according to whether the NRMA succeeded on
a cause of action in contract
or in tort, and it was accepted that if the NRMA
succeeded on what might be called contractual negligence it would also succeed
on
what might be called tortious negligence.  
<P>

107	At the time of the hearing it was also accepted that questions of
contributory negligence and contribution (see later in these
reasons) were in
the circumstances of this case not affected by liability being in contract
rather than in tort, and with one qualification
in the manner the proceedings
were conducted it was unnecessary to distinguish between the claims for breach
of contract and for
negligence.  The qualification was that, although perhaps
not recognised by it, the NRMA's reliance on the reasoning of the High
Court
in<i> McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 79</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2084%20CLR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 84 CLR 377</a> for
recovery of the wasted expenditure as damages for free shares/disadvantages
liability may have required, or been assisted by,
liability for breach of
contract.
<P>

108	More point to distinguishing between the claims for breach of contract and
the claims for negligence came with the decision
of the High Court, after the
hearing and while judgment was reserved, in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999)
HCA 6.</a>  To the potential disadvantage of the defendants, it was held that
contributory negligence did not provide a defence to a claim for
breach of
contract even where the claim was also brought in tort.  Since the duties of
care had the same content, this meant that
contributory negligence was of no
value to AAH and AT as a defence to the claim for negligence (although both
maintained that <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i> did not affect contributory
negligence so far as it was an available defence to the statutory claims).
<P>

109	Mr  Heydon was asked by AAH and AT, in briefs and letters, to advise
the NRMA in relation to matters to do with the formulation
and implementation
of the proposal.  The NRMA alleged in the points of claim, but Mr Heydon
did not accept in his defence, that the
circumstances in which he was asked to,
and did, advise, and the matters in relation to which he was asked to advise,
were such that
he owed to it a duty of care under common law principles
relating to negligence, being a duty of care to exercise reasonable care,
skill
and diligence -
<P>

"(a)	to give timely and accurate advice to the Plaintiffs in connection with
all legal issues arising out of the Proposal in respect
of which Heydon had
been briefed;

limited to the use therein of the expressions `free shares'

 (e)	to advise whether the prospectus disclosed all information which was
necessary to make it true and not misleading;
<P>

 (f)	to advise whether the accompanying documents (including the onsert) which
had been briefed to him disclosed all information
which was necessary to make
them true and not misleading;
<P>

 (g)	to advise whether the Proposal was lawful and capable of
implementation;
<P>

 (h)	to proffer timely and accurate advice to the Plaintiffs of any risk that
any aspect of the Proposal (including any of the documents
referred to above)
might be or be rendered unlawful."
<P>

110	The full width of the alleged duty of care was not maintained in
submissions, in that negligence in failure to advise in relation
to the
disadvantages question was not maintained against Mr Heydon, and the failures
to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence
on which the NRMA relied to
some extent confined the contest over the extent of Mr Heydon's duty of care.
A significant contest remained.
<P>

111	It was alleged that Mr Heydon breached the duty of care in that he
failed to exercise the reasonable care, skill and diligence,
again with lengthy
particulars of the failures.  As in the case of the claims against AAH and AT,
in the hearing of the proceedings
the prolixity of the particulars was not
taken up, and more concise and confined submissions of failure to exercise the
reasonable
care, skill and diligence were made.  The thrust of the failures
alleged in submissions, to which again I will come in due course,
was that Mr
Heydon should have advised that there was a real risk that the proposal as then
determined could be rendered unlawful
by the decision of the High Court on a
successful appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and should have advised against
describing the shares as free shares at all, or at least that the lawfulness of
the description
should be considered.  As I have said, negligence in failure to
advise in relation to the disadvantages question was not maintained
against Mr
Heydon, but it was submitted that lack of balance in the prospectus was "all
the more reason for him to give cautious
and careful advice about the use of
the expression `free'." 
<P>

112	It was then alleged that in consequence of the breaches of the duties of
care the NRMA suffered loss in the amount of the wasted
expenditure.  What I
have earlier said applies.  Since the claim against him was in tort alone,
contributory negligence remained
a defence available to Mr Heydon.

<b>Contravention of the TP Act and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a></b>
<P>

113	The statutory bases for the causes of action were ss 52 and 82 of the TP
Act and the corresponding provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.  
<P>

114	Section 52 of the TP Act, the provision on which the applicants in the
Federal Court proceedings relied in 1994 to the detriment
of the NRMA, provided
so far as relevant -
<P>

"52 (1)  A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that
is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead
or deceive."
<P>

Section 52 was in Part V of the TP Act.  Section 82 of the TP Act provided
so far as relevant -
<P>

"82 (1)  A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that
was done in contravention of a provision of Part
IV or V may recover the amount
of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person
involved in the contravention."
<P>

115	Section s 42 and 68 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> were in the same terms, save that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> referred to a "person" rather than a "corporation".
<P>

116	The NRMA alleged in the points of claim that by breaching their duties of
care, further or alternatively by failing to correct
"the prospectus, the
accompanying documents and the promotional materials" so as to ensure that
there were no misleading or deceptive
representations contained within them,
AAH and AT in trade or commerce engaged in misleading conduct in contravention
of s 52 of
the TP Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.  It alleged that by
breaching his duty of care Mr Heydon in trade or commerce engaged in
misleading conduct in contravention of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.  It then
alleged that the NRMA suffered loss or damage by that contravening conduct,
recoverable under s 82 of the TP Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, in the amount of
the wasted expenditure.
<P>

117	The "accompanying documents" were the onsert.  The "promotional materials"
were the materials such as media statements, letters
or articles in the NRMA
magazine The Open Road, letters to members, and scripts for responses on a
telephone hotline, produced during
1994 and relevantly referring to free
shares.  The promotional materials had been taken up in the allegation of
duties of care, although
it has not been necessary to refer to that aspect of
the allegation, and will be referred in some detail in these reasons, but their
significance in the proceedings was only as part of the conduct of the parties
illuminating the allegations of default in relation
to the prospectus and
onsert.  The decisions of Gummow J and the Full Court were not founded on
misleading or deceptive representations
in the promotional materials.  The
NRMA's case in these proceedings as opened and conducted relevantly involved
loss because the
decision of the Full Court prevented the proposal from going
to the general meetings, and any breach of duty or conduct in contravention
of
s 52 of the TP Act or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> affecting the promotional materials
was not causative of the loss alleged.  What the NRMA relied on was the
deficiencies in the prospectus
found by the Full Court, not (save as part of
the illustrative conduct) any deficiencies in the promotional materials.
<P>

118	Neither AAH nor AT was a corporation.  In its opening, and even in
submissions, the NRMA said that s 52 of the TP Act nonetheless
extended to
them by the operation of s 6 of the TP Act.  It did not  seem to matter,
because if AAH or AT contravened <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> nothing more would
flow to the NRMA if they also contravened s 52 of the TP Act, and reliance
on the TP Act brought complications
which need not be described.  Therefore,
but also at a late stage in submissions, the NRMA expressly abandoned its
claims against
AAH and AT for contravention of the TP Act, and confined its
claims to claims for contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.  Again at a late stage in
submissions, the NRMA expressly abandoned its claim against Mr Heydon for
contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.
<P>

became, was concerned only with the free shares question and the disadvantages
question:  the case of failure adequately
to advise in relation to risk to the
proposal in connection with <i>Gambotto's case</i> was no part of the claims.
What I have said about a global claim of loss applies.

120	The statutory basis for the cause of action were the provisions already

to recovery against any person "involved in the contravention".  Section 75B of
the TP Act provided so far as relevant -

the TP Act.
<P>

123	The NRMA alleged in the points of claim that Association and Insurance had
suffered loss or damage by conduct of Holdings, namely
the distribution of the
prospectus and the onsert;  that the conduct was in contravention of s 52
of the TP Act (Gummow J and the
Full Court had so held) and also
constituted contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>;  and that all of AAH, AT
and Mr Heydon were persons involved in the contraventions because they
aided, abetted, counselled and procured
the contraventions, induced the
contraventions by their own conduct, and were directly and indirectly knowingly
concerned in or parties
to the contraventions.  The conduct of AAH, AT and
Mr Heydon alleged as their involvement was their breaches of their duties
of care,
and in the case of AAH and AT failing to correct the prospectus, the
accompanying documents and the promotional materials so as to
ensure that there
were no misleading or deceptive representations contained within them.  The
loss or damage alleged was again the
amount of the wasted expenditure.
<P>

124	The abandonment of the claims against AAH and AT for contravention of the
TP Act was matched by abandonment of the claims for
involvement in
contravention of the TP Act against all of AAH, AT and Mr Heydon.  The claim
against Mr Heydon for involvement in
contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> was
maintained.  So in the end the claims were against all defendants for

dispute that if Holdings had contravened s 52 of the TP Act it had also
contravened <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.

127	The NRMA alleged in the points of claim that AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon
engaged in misleading conduct in contravention of s 995(2)
in or in connection
with the making of arrangements and the doing of other acts preparatory to and
in other ways related to the allotment
or issue of securities in the capital of
Holdings and the prospectus issued and the other documents published in
relation to the
securities of Holdings.  The particulars of the allegation took
up the matters alleged to give rise to the duties of care and breaches
of the
duties of care.  It was then alleged that the NRMA suffered loss or damage by
that contravening conduct, recoverable under
s 1005(1), in the amount of
the wasted expenditure.
<P>

128	At one of the late stages in submissions the NRMA abandoned this claim
against Mr Heydon.  Perhaps because, in the claims against
AAH and AT, it was
not necessary that the misleading conduct be in trade or commerce, the claims
were maintained against AAH and
AT.  It was not suggested that anything else
flowed to the NRMA from these claims which would not flow from the claims for
contravention
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.
<P>

129	Again, the claims for contravention of s 995(2) of the Law were concerned
only with the free shares question and the disadvantages

<P>

<b>Contravention of s 996(1) of the Law</b>
<P>

130	Section 996(1) of the Law, also contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7.11" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7.11</a>, provided -

			the prospectus."
<P>

Section 1005(1) extended also to loss or damage by conduct engaged in in
contravention of s 996(1).
<P>

131	The NRMA alleged in the points of claim that AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon
contravened s 996(1) by authorising or causing the issue
of a prospectus which
was or was required to be lodged under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7.12" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7.12</a> of the Law, which contained
material statements which were false or misleading, and which omitted material
information.  It was not
in dispute that the prospectus was in relation to the
securities of a corporation and was, and was required to be, lodged under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7.12" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
7.12</a> of the Law.  The allegation was not fully particularised, but in substance
was that the authorising or causing was by their involvement
in the preparation
and distribution of the prospectus, and that the false or misleading statements
and omissions in the prospectus
were the matters with which the free shares
question and the disadvantages question were concerned.  In submissions the
case for
authorising or causing was not greatly elucidated, involving only
broad reference to the respective involvements in the preparation
and
distribution of the prospectus.  It was then alleged that the NRMA suffered
loss or damage by the contravening conduct, recoverable
under s 1005(1), in the
amount of the wasted expenditure.  
<P>

132	Again, the claims for contravention of s 996(1) of the Law were concerned
only with the free shares question and the disadvantages
question:  the case of
failure adequately to advise in relation to risk to the proposal in connection
with <i>Gambotto's case</i> was no part of the claims.  What I have said about
a global claim of loss applies.
<P>

133	So the claims against the defendants came down to claims for -
<P>

(i)	contractual and tortious negligence, against AAH and AT, and tortious
negligence, against Mr Heydon;
<P>

(ii)	contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, against AAH and AT;
<P>

(iii)	involvement in Holdings' contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, against AAH, AT and

(iv)	contravention of s 995(2) of the Law, against AAH and AT;  and
<P>

(v)	contravention of s 996(1) of the Law, against AAH, AT and Mr Heydon.
<P>

The claims in (i) were for all Gambotto liability and free shares disadvantages
liability.  The claims in (ii) to (v) were for free
shares disadvantages
liability alone.
<P>

<center><b>IV  THE DEFENDANTS' DEFENCES</b></center>
<P>

134	I will outline the defences as filed sufficiently to indicate significant
areas of contention and provide some focus when addressing
the facts.
<P>

<b>Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley</b>
<P>

135	AAH accepted in its defence, ultimately that filed on 15 June 1998,
that it was retained by the NRMA, amongst other things,
to advise on the
possible alternative structures for what became the proposal, to advise on the
compliance of the structure and its
implementation with the Law and "the
general law", and to comment on various drafts of the prospectus and
accompanying documents
and some promotional materials.  
<P>

136	It accepted that it was retained "to advise in respect of the final form of
the Prospectus as to whether any matter had come
to their attention which
caused them to believe" that the prospectus contained any material statement
(excluding the financial material)
that was false or misleading, that there was
any material omission from the prospectus, and that the issue of the prospectus
might
involve the NRMA in misleading conduct.  The words "had come to their
attention which caused them to believe" should be noted.  AAH
denied "the
absence of any advice that the Prospectus was or might be misleading, deceptive
or in any other respect unlawful".  
<P>

137	In relation to <i>Gambotto's case</i>, AAH admitted that it did not give
what the NRMA had defined in the points of claim as "the Gambotto advice" which
should have been
given, namely, "that the prudent course after 10 December
1993, alternatively after 21 April 1994, was for the Plaintiffs not to
proceed with the Proposal, alternatively to proceed with the Proposal only to
the extent necessary to ensure that the Proposal was
kept in a state in which
it could be revived, altered or abandoned conveniently and economically once
the decision of the High Court
in Gambotto was delivered".  (This Gambotto
advice was rather different from the Gambotto advice taken up in the NRMA's
evidence,
but it was not in dispute that AAH did not give the latter Gambotto
advice either.)  
<P>

138	AAH admitted that it knew that the NRMA was relying on it to advise of any
risk of which it (AAH) was aware based on the information
provided to it and,
subject to the qualifications contained in AAH's letter of 18 August 1994
(being the so-called sign-off letter
in relation to the proposal), of any risk
that rendered the proposal unlawful, but denied that the NRMA had suffered any
loss or
damage by reason of any act or omission of AAH.  Indeed, in some parts
of the defence AAH denied that the NRMA had suffered any loss
at all.
<P>

139	Specifically as to ss 995(2) and 996(1) of the Law, AAH said that the
NRMA could not rely on those provisions because the NRMA
had itself contravened
them, and because as a matter of construction the provisions were not available
to a corporation issuing or
involved in the issue of the prospectus or a
corporation related to such a corporation.  This was not taken up in
submissions.
<P>

140	AAH specifically raised two issues of causation.  The first was that any
loss suffered by the NRMA was not caused by any act
or omission on the part of
AAH, but was caused by the supervening decision of the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> "which declared the law in a way which made it
impossible to implement, or which led to the Plaintiff's abandoning the
implementation
of, the Proposal by way of resolutions at members' meetings".
The second had a number of elements rather confusingly thrown together,
and was
to the effect that any loss or damage suffered by the NRMA was not caused by
any act or omission on the part of AAH because
the proposal would have been
rejected by the members for reasons to do with the financial forecasts in the
prospectus and the financial
position of Insurance.  It was said that the
prospectus contained financial forecasts which would have precluded the NRMA
from continuing
with the proposal, or alternatively would in any event have
required a supplementary prospectus to have been issued, with particulars
that
by November 1994 the profit performance of the NRMA was such that it was likely
that the profit for 1994-95 would be materially
different from that forecast in
the prospectus.  It was also said that the financial position of Insurance was
such that, had it
been known to members at the general meetings "as it would
have been as a result of the public announcement of the year's results",
the
proposal would have been rejected by members, or if the proposal had been
initially approved was such that it would have led
to the ultimate overturning
of any decisions of the members made on the basis of the incorrect financial
information.  
<P>

141	Involved in these issues, at least as they were later explained, was that
putting the proposal to the general meetings would
have been delayed by the
decision of Gummow J even if the defendants had not been at fault in relation
to the free shares question
or the disadvantages question, because his Honour's
orders were founded in part on other deficiencies in the prospectus not now
alleged
against the defendants, and that during the delay the inhibiting
financial position would have become known and would have brought
defeat to the
proposal;  further, during the delay the decision of the High Court would have
been given with the same result.  More
as to these issues should await the
attention to the submissions on causation later in these reasons.  There was no
doubt during
the hearing that AAH (and the other defendants) sought to defeat
the NRMA on causation grounds which included the issues of causation
specifically raised.
<P>

142	AAH relied on some exculpatory provisions of the Law.  They were complex
and difficult to summarise.  AT and Mr Heydon also
relied on some exculpatory
provisions of the Law, with overlapping between the provisions relied on, and
it is convenient to set
out now the full spectrum of the provisions.
<P>

143	First, AAH relied on part of the combined operation of ss 1006 and
1009 of the Law in answer to the claims for contravention
of ss 995(2) and
996(1).  By s 1006(1), s 1006 applied - 
<P>

"... for the purposes of an action under section 1005 in respect of conduct
being the issue of a prospectus in relation to securities
of a corporation:
<P>

	(a)	in which there is a material statement that is false or misleading; or
<P>

	(b)	from which there is a material omission".
<P>

Then by s 1006(2) the reference in s 1005(1) to any person involved in the
contravention included a reference to all or any of -
<P>

"(e)	if the prospectus includes a statement that purports to be, or to be based
on, a statement made by an expert and the expert
gave consent under section
1032 to the issue of the prospectus - that expert;
<P>

<i>	...</i>
<P>

(g)	a person named, with the consent of the person, in the prospectus as an
auditor, banker or solicitor or the corporation or for
or in relation to the
issue or proposed issue of securities;
<P>

(h)	a person named, with the consent of the person, in the prospectus as having
performed or performing any function in a professional,
advisory or other
capacity not mentioned in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) for the corporation or for
or in relation to the issue or proposed
issue of securities".
<P>

Then by s 1009(2), (3) and (4) -
<P>

"(2)	A person referred to section 1006(2)(e)(g) or (h) is liable in an action
under section 1005 only in respect of:
<P>

(a)	a false or misleading statement in the prospectus purporting to be made by
the person as a person referred to in that paragraph,
or to be based on a
statement made by the person as a person referred to in that paragraph; or
<P>

(ba)	in the case of a person referred to in paragraph 1006(2)(e) - an omission
of any material matter from a statement in the prospectus
purporting to be made
by the person as a person referred to in paragraph 1006(2)(e), or to be based
on a statement made by the person
as such a person; or
<P>

(b)	in the case of a person referred to in paragraph 1006(2)(g) or (h) - an
omission from the prospectus of any material matter
for which the person is
responsible in the person's capacity or purported capacity as a person referred
to in paragraph 1006(2)(g)
or (h).
<P>

(3)	A person referred to in paragraph 1006(2)(e) is not liable in an action
under section 1005 in respect of a false or misleading
statement in, or an
omission from, the prospectus if it is proved:
<P>

	...
<P>

(c)	that the person was competent to make the statement and, after making such
inquiries (if any) as were reasonable, had reasonable
grounds to believe, and
did until the time of the allotment or issue of the securities believe that:
<P>

(i)	if the action is in respect of a false or misleading statement - the
statement was true and not misleading; or
<P>

(ii)	if the action is in respect of an omission from a statement - there were
no material omissions from the statement.
<P>

(4)	A person referred to in paragraph 1006(2)(g) or (h) is not liable in an
action under section 1005 in respect of a false or misleading
statement in, or
an omission from, the prospectus if it is proved:
<P>

	...
<P>

(b)	in the case of a statement - that the person was competent to make the
statement and, after making such inquiries (if any) as
were reasonable, had
reasonable grounds to believe, and did until the time of the allotment or issue
of the securities believed,
that the statement was true and not misleading;
or
<P>

(c)	in the case of an omission - that the person, after making such inquiries
(if any) as were reasonable, had reasonable grounds
to believe, and did until
the time of the allotment or issue of the securities believe, that there were
no omissions from the prospectus
of material matters for which the person was
responsible in the person's capacity as a person referred to in paragraph
1006(2)(g)
or (h), and that the person was competent to act in that
capacity".
<P>

Very broadly, an adviser could gain protection under these provisions if his
involvement was limited or he had acted reasonably.
 The reliance of AAH, as
pleaded in its defence, was confined to the exculpation under s 1009(4), and in
submissions it did not take
it up at all.  
<P>

144	Secondly, AAH relied on s 1011(1) of the Law in answer to the claims for
contravention of ss 995(2) and 996(1):  it provided
-
<P>

"1011(1)	The corporation, a person referred to in paragraph 1006(2)(d) or (f)
or a person who authorised or caused the issue of
the prospectus is not liable
in an action under section 1005 if it is proved that the false or misleading
statement or the omission:
<P>

	(a)	was due to a reasonable mistake;
<P>

	(b)	was due to reasonable reliance on information supplied by 
<P>

		another person; or
<P>

	(c)	was due to the act or default of another person, to an 
<P>

		accident or to some other cause beyond the defendant's 
<P>

		control;
<P>

	and, in a case to which paragraph (c) of this subsection applies, that the
defendant took reasonable precautions and exercised
due diligence to ensure
that all statements to be included in the prospectus were true and not
misleading and that there were no
material omissions from the prospectus."
<P>

Again very broadly, a person could escape liability if he had acted reasonably.
This was taken up in submissions.
<P>

145	Thirdly, AAH relied on s 1318(1) of the Law together with
s 1318(4) describing its application, in answer to all the claims
against
it.  They provided -
<P>

"1318(1)	If, in any civil proceeding against a person to whom this section
applies for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach
of duty in a
capacity as such a person, it appears to the court before which the proceedings
are taken that the person is or may
be liable in respect of the negligence,
default of breach but that the person has acted honestly and that, having
regard to all the
circumstances of the case, including those connected with the
person's appointment, the person ought fairly to be excused for the
negligence,
default or breach, the court may relieve the person either wholly or partly
from liability on such terms as the court
thinks fit."
<P>

 "(4)	This section applies to a person who is:
<P>

(a)	an officer of a corporation;
<P>

(b)	an auditor of a corporation, whether or not the person is 
<P>

	an officer of the corporation;
<P>

(c)	an expert in relation to a matter:
<P>

	  (i)		relating to a corporation;  and
<P>

	  (ii)		in relation to which the civil proceedings has been 
<P>

			taken or the claim will or might arise; or
<P>

(d)	a receiver, receiver and manager, liquidator or other person appointed or
directed by the court to carry out any duty under
this Law in relation to a
corporation."
<P>

Again very broadly, an expert could escape liability if he had acted honestly
and should be excused.  This was also taken up by
AAH in submissions, although
only in relation to the claims for contravention of ss 995(2) and 996(1) of the
Law.
<P>

146	AAH then said that the NRMA had failed to mitigate its loss, because it
could have rectified any misleading or deceptive statements
in the prospectus
by issuing a supplementary prospectus and did not do so, alternatively because
after the decision of the High Court
in <i>Gambotto's case</i> it was still
open to the NRMA to implement the proposal by way of a court-approved scheme of
arrangement but the NRMA did not do
so.
<P>

147	Finally, AAH alleged that the NRMA contributed to its loss by its own
negligence and that, if AAH was liable, the amount for
which it was held liable
should be reduced by such amount as was thought just and equitable in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1965404/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1965404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
1965</a>.  Detailed particulars of the contributory negligence were given,
rivalling in prolixity the NRMA's particulars of breach, the thrust
of which
was that the NRMA was at fault in persisting with the description "Free Shares"
knowing of the risk in doing so and that
the NRMA was at fault in either
inadequately identifying the disadvantages in the proposal or going ahead with
the proposal knowing
that the prospectus did not adequately address them.  As I
have indicated, following the decision in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i>
contributory negligence was not available to AAH as a defence to the claim for
breach of contract, and so of no practical value as
a defence to the claim for
negligence.  At least in submissions, the parties were at issue over whether
contributory negligence was
a defence to the statutory claims, and <i>Astley v
Austrust Ltd</i> was said by the NRMA to support its position and by the
defendants to support their positions.
<P>

<b>Abbott Tout</b>
<P>

148	The position of AT was in many respects, but not all, the same as or
similar to that of AAH.
<P>

149	AT accepted in its defence, ultimately that filed on 16 June 1998,
that it was retained to assist in relation to the proposal,
but said that its
retainer was restricted to a list of particular matters  This particularity -
and the list was long - was apparently
with a view to excluding any duty of
care in relation to the free shares question, the disadvantages question, or
the impact of <i>Gambotto's case</i> on the proposal, as the defence did not
concede such a duty of care, and in the course of the evidence there was
occasional reference
to such a stance.  As I have indicated, in the result
there was little issue over the existence of a duty of care sufficient for
the
failures to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence on which the NRMA
relied.  That the retainer included providing a "sign-off
letter in relation to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1965404/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus" was admitted.
<P>

150	AT did not specifically deny the allegation of breach of the duty of care,
but the proceedings were conducted on the basis that
breach was in issue.  It
admitted that it did not give the Gambotto advice, while saying that it was not
retained to advise in relation
to <i>Gambotto's case</i> and that in any event
the Gambotto advice would not have been appropriate.
<P>

151	Specifically as to ss 995(2) and 996(1) of the Law, AT also said that
the NRMA was not entitled to rely on those provisions
because the NRMA had
itself contravened them, or in the alternative that the NRMA was "not within
the category of persons to whom
Sections 995, 996 and 1005 (in relation to a
contravention of Sections 995 or 996) of the Corporations Law are available to
be relied
upon or used for relief".  This was not taken up in submissions.
<P>

152	As to causation, AT raised the issues which AAH had raised concerning the
supervening decision in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, the financial forecasts in the
prospectus, and the financial position of Insurance.  There were some
differences in expression from
the defence of AAH, but not such as to warrant
further attention at this point.  AT also relied upon exculpatory provisions of
the
Law, in its case the full range of provisions earlier set out (except
s 1011(1)(a)).  As to s 1318(1) its reliance also extended
to all
claims against it, and AT did take this up in submissions.
<P>

153	AT said that the NRMA had failed to mitigate its loss, because it failed to
seek special leave to appeal to the High Court from
the decision of the Full
Court, failed to issue a supplementary prospectus, and failed to implement the
proposal by way of a scheme
of arrangement.  In submissions, failure to seek
special leave to appeal to the High Court was expressly abandoned.
<P>

154	Finally, AT also alleged contributory negligence on the part of the NRMA,
with detailed particulars with a similar thrust to
that earlier described but
more directly asserting that the NRMA chose to rely on the advice of its
directors, management, legal
staff, consultants, and "other external lawyers"
rather than the advice of AT.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon</b>
<P>

155	Mr Heydon's defence was ultimately that filed on 15 June 1998.  He
admitted that he owed to the NRMA a duty of care "in connection
with the
expression of his opinion on the matters in respect of which it was sought, but
only to the extent that his advice was sought
by any particular company on any
particular occasion".  He denied any wider duty of care.  He said that he was
not asked to express
an opinion material to the free shares question, the
disadvantages question, or the impact of <i>Gambotto's case</i> on the
proposal, save to the extent of certain limited advice in relation to the
onsert at the beginning of August 1994 as to which
he said there was no breach
of the duty of care.  He denied that he was asked to advise or express an
opinion on whether the prospectus
was or might be misleading, deceptive, or in
any other respect unlawful, and denied that there was any occasion for him to
advise
as to the materiality of <i>Gambotto's case</i> to the proposal.  His
position included, therefore, that he did not owe to the NRMA a duty of care
within which fell the failures
to advise alleged by the NRMA.
<P>

156	Specifically as to ss 995(2) and 996(1) of the Law, Mr Heydon said
that as a matter of construction the NRMA was not within
the category of
persons who could rely on those provisions because each of Association,
Insurance and Holdings was either responsible
for conduct engaged in in
contravention of the provisions or was involved in the contraventions.  As I
have said, the allegation
of contravention of s 995(2) of the Law was
abandoned as against Mr Heydon, but he did not take this response up in
submissions in
relation to s 996(1).  
<P>

157	Mr Heydon's defence did not expressly raise the issues going to
causation or mitigation (the supervening decision in <i>Gambotto's case</i>,
failure to seek special leave to appeal to the High Court, failure to issue a
supplementary prospectus, failure to proceed by way
of a scheme of arrangement)
which had been raised by AAH and AT.  Mr Heydon did not rely on the
exculpatory provisions of the Law,
save that he relied on s 1318(1) in relation
to all the claims against him.  Mr Heydon alleged contributory negligence
on the part
of the NRMA, again with extensive particulars the thrust of which
was similar to the thrust of those in the defence of AT.  
<P>

158	The additional matter in Mr Heydon's defence was that the claims under
the TP Act and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> were said to be statute barred because they accrued
more than three years before action was commenced against him (see TP Act
s 82(2),
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68(2)).</a>  With the abandonment of the claims under
the TP Act, only the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> was relevant.  It was acknowledged in submissions
that the matter was likely to be academic.  If Mr Heydon was liable for
negligence,
there was no limitation defence.  If he was not liable for
negligence, at least at one point the NRMA agreed that it was unlikely
that he
would be found liable for involvement in Holdings' contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, although that does not automatically follow.  
<P>

<center><b>V  OTHER CLAIMS IN THE PROCEEDINGS</b></center>
<P>

159	Each of AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon cross-claimed against the others of
them for indemnity or contribution.  The cross-claim of AAH
repeated the NRMA's
allegations against AT and Mr Heydon, alleged that AT and Mr Heydon
"caused or contributed to" the NRMA's loss
or damage, and said that AT and
Mr Heydon were "liable to pay contribution" to AAH.  The nature and source
of the liability were
not stated.  The cross-claim of AT alleged that if AT was
liable to the NRMA then AAH and Mr Heydon were also liable to the NRMA,
and said that AT was "entitled to contribution" from AAH and Mr Heydon.
The entitlement was said to be as an action for contribution
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</i> 1946</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>") "or in
equity".  The cross-claim of Mr Heydon was similar to that of AT, save
that it claimed a declaration "as to the apportionment
of liability, either
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</i>
1946</a> (NSW) or in equity" and judgment to give effect to the apportionment of
liability, and a specific order as to costs incurred by Mr
Heydon.
<P>

160	Each of AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon also cross-claimed against the NRMA.
Subject to a qualification, to which I will come, the cross-claims
took the
same form.  They were expressed to be for contribution under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR
Act</a>  <i>"or otherwise", </i>which had the virtue of comprehensiveness but
called for explanation.  
<P>

161	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a> provides, so far as relevant -
<P>

"5(1)	Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a
crime or not) -
<P>

	...
<P>

(c)		any tort-feasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution
from any other tort-feasor who is, or would if sued
have been, liable in
respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tort-feasor or otherwise, so,
however, that no person shall be
entitled to recover contribution under this
section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the
liability
in respect of which the contribution is sought.
<P>

  (2)	In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the
contribution recoverable from any person shall be
such as may be found by the
court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person's
responsibility for the damage;
and the court shall have power to exempt any
person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution
to be
recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity."
<P>

162	The "or otherwise" in the cross-claims against the NRMA was explained as
involving the principle of contribution for which <i>Albion Insurance Company
Ltd v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20121%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 121 CLR 342</a> is
commonly cited ("the Albion principle"), that persons who are under co-ordinate
liabilities to make good the one loss must share
the burden pro rata (see in
particular per Kitto J at 349-50).  
<P>

163	When the cross-claims were brought, by amendment early in the hearing, the
NRMA suggested that they raised claims unknown to
the law, and were the product
of misplaced ingenuity and without substance.  The amendment was nonetheless
consented to, on the basis
that the merits of the cross-claims would be
addressed together with all other issues in the proceedings (and according to
the NRMA
would be found to be nil).  The description of the cross-claims
against the NRMA should include their "or otherwise" basis, although
it must be
accepted that in those and other respects the cross-claims may be novel and a
proper description is therefore not short.
<P>

164	I will first describe the cross-claims by reference to the cross-claim by
AAH, and then describe the qualification arising in
the cross-claim by AT.
<P>

165	The first way in which the cross-claim was put was to the following effect.
If the distribution of the prospectus and accompanying
documents was misleading
conduct, as found in the Federal Court, then each of Association, Insurance,
and Holdings had engaged in
misleading conduct in contravention of s 52 of
the TP Act and s 995(2) of the Law, and each of Association, Insurance,
and Holdings
had authorised or caused the issue of an erroneous prospectus in
contravention of s 996(1) of the Law.  Where Association engaged
in the
misleading conduct, or authorised or caused the issue of the prospectus, then
Insurance and Holdings were both involved in
the contraventions (I use the word
"involved" to encompass aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, inducing, and
being knowingly
concerned in or a party to the contraventions).  Where
Insurance engaged in the misleading conduct, or authorised or caused the issue
of the prospectus, then Association and Holdings were both involved in the
contraventions.  Where Holdings engaged in the misleading
conduct, or
authorised or caused the issue of the prospectus, then Association and
Insurance were both involved in the contraventions.
 Therefore -
<P>

(a)	if AAH was a tortfeasor liable to Association or Insurance, Holdings was a
tortfeasor liable to Association or Insurance and
there could be contribution
from Holdings to AAH under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;  if AAH was a tortfeasor
liable to Insurance or Holdings, Association was a tortfeasor liable to
Insurance or Holdings and there
could be contribution from Association to AAH
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;  and if AAH was a tortfeasor liable to Association or
Holdings, Insurance was a tortfeasor liable to Association or Holdings and
there could be contribution from Insurance to AAH under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;
and
<P>

(b)	Holdings was under a co-ordinate liability with AAH in respect of any
liability of AAH to Association or Insurance;  Association
was under a
co-ordinate liability with AAH in respect of any liability of AAH to Insurance
or Holdings;  Insurance was under a co-ordinate
liability with AAH in respect
of any liability of AAH to Association and Holdings;  and if AAH was liable to
Association, Insurance,
or Holdings it was entitled to contribution whereby the
burdens were shared pro rata under the Albion principle.
<P>

166	The second way in which the cross-claim was put was to the following
effect.  Association and Insurance were promoters of Holdings.
 Where by the
issue of the prospectus Association, Insurance, and Holdings engaged in
misleading conduct in contravention of s 995(2)
of the Law, or authorised
or caused the issue of an erroneous prospectus in contravention of
s 996(1) of the Law, then, because they
were promoters, by force of
s 1006 of the Law Association was involved in the contraventions by
Insurance and Holdings and Insurance
was involved in the contraventions by
Association and Holdings.  Therefore -
<P>

(a)	if AAH was a tortfeasor liable to Insurance or Holdings, Association was a
tortfeasor liable to Insurance or Holdings and there
could be contribution from
Association to AAH under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;  if AAH was a tortfeasor
liable to Association or Holdings, Insurance was a tortfeasor liable to
Association or Holdings and there
could be contribution from Insurance to AAH
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;  and
<P>

(b)	Association was under a co-ordinate liability with AAH in respect of any
liability of AAH to Insurance or Holdings;  Insurance
was under a co-ordinate
liability with AAH in respect of any liability of AAH to Association or
Holdings;  and if AAH was liable
to Association, Insurance, and Holdings it was
entitled to contribution whereby the burdens were shared pro rata under the
Albion
principle.
<P>

167	The third way in which the cross-claim was put was to the following effect.
Association and Insurance were promoters of the
proposal.  They prepared drafts
of the prospectus and considered whether it was misleading.  To their
knowledge, Holdings relied
on them in that respect.  Association and Insurance
therefore owed duties of care to Holdings in relation to the preparation and
content of the prospectus.  They breached those duties of care (presumably in
that the distribution of the prospectus was found to
be misleading conduct),
whereby Holdings suffered loss.  Therefore -
<P>

(a)	if AAH was a tortfeasor liable to Holdings, Association and Insurance were
tortfeasors liable to Holdings and there could be
contribution from Association
and Insurance to AAH under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;  and
<P>

(b)	Association and Insurance were under co-ordinate liabilities with AAH in
respect of any liability of AAH to Holdings, and if
AAH was liable to Holdings
it was entitled to contribution whereby the burden was shared pro rata under
the Albion principle.
<P>

168	The fourth way in which the cross-claim was put was to the following
effect.  Association and Insurance were funding the proposal.
 Holdings was
issuing the prospectus and offering shares thereunder.  Holdings therefore owed
duties of care to Association and Insurance
in relation to the preparation and
content of the prospectus.  It breached the duties of care (again presumably in
that distribution
of the prospectus was found to be misleading conduct),
whereby Association and Insurance suffered loss.  Therefore -
<P>

(a)	if AAH was a tortfeasor liable to Association or Insurance, Holdings was a
tortfeasor liable to Association and Insurance and
there could be contribution
from Holdings to AAH under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>;  and
<P>

(b)	Holdings was under a co-ordinate liability with AAH in respect of any
liability of AAH to Association and Insurance, and if
AAH was liable to
Association and Insurance it was entitled to contribution whereby the burden
was shared pro rata under the Albion
principle.
<P>

169	The qualification earlier mentioned was that the cross-claim by AT was put
in three further ways.  
<P>

170	First, it was alleged that there were implied terms of the contract arising
pursuant to AT's retainer that Association, Insurance
and Holdings "would
provide complete and proper instructions to enable AT properly and fully to
advise on and assist in preparing"
the prospectus and other documents, to the
extent to which AT did so, and "would properly use advice, drafts and other
material in
respect of" the prospectus and other documents provided by AT to
any of them.  It was alleged that the implied terms were breached,
taking up
the matters particularised for the contributory negligence put forward in AT's
defence, and it was said that AT thereby
suffered loss being<i> </i>"such
losses, damages, costs and expenses as AT has incurred in respect of these
proceedings and is alleged or found liable (if any)
to pay in these
proceedings".<i>  </i>
<P>

171	Secondly, it was alleged that Association, Insurance, and Holdings owed a
duty of care to AT "by implied term in the relevant
retainer and, further and
in the alternative under the general law" to exercise reasonable care in a
number of respects, that they
failed to do so (again taking up the particulars
of contributory negligence), and that AT thereby suffered the same loss as just
described.  The exercise of reasonable care was said to have been
required -
<P>

"(a)	in providing complete and proper instructions to enable AT properly and
fully to advise on and assist in preparing the Prospectus,
the Accompanying
Documents and the Promotional Materials (to the extent it is found that such
documents were advised on and their
preparation assisted by AT);
<P>

(b)	in using advice, drafts and other materials in respect of the Prospectus,
the Accompanying Documents and the Materials provided
by AT to any of
Association, Insurance and Holdings;
<P>

(c)	in preparing, considering and commenting upon drafts of the Prospectus, the
Accompanying Documents and the Promotional Materials;
<P>

(d)	to ensure that the Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the
Promotional Materials did not contain any misleading, incorrect
or incomplete
information, statement or representation;
<P>

(e)	to ensure that the Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the
Promotional Materials disclosed all information which was
necessary to make
each of them true and not misleading; and
<P>

(f)	to ensure that the Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the
Promotional Materials contained information that was fair
and balanced."
<P>

172	Thirdly, it was alleged that Association, Insurance, and Holdings in trade
or commerce "represented, gave the impression, or
created in AT a reasonable
expectation" as to a number of matters, that the representation, impression or
reasonable expectation
was incorrect (again the particulars of contributory
negligence were taken up), that by reason of that incorrectness Association,
Insurance, and Holdings had contravened s 52 of the TP Act, and that AT
had thereby suffered the same loss as earlier described.
 The matters were
connected with the areas for exercise of reasonable care just set out, and were
said to be -
<P>

"(a)	they and each of them had provided complete and proper instructions to
enable AT properly and fully to advise on and assist
in preparing the
Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the Promotional Materials (to the
extent it is found that such documents
were advised on and their preparation
assisted by AT) or had taken reasonable care so to do;
<P>

(b)	they and each of them had completely and properly used advice, drafts and
other material in respect of Documents and the Promotional
Materials provided
by AT to any of Association, Insurance and Holdings or had taken reasonable
care so to do;
<P>

(c)	they and each of them had taken reasonable care in preparing, considering
and commenting upon drafts of the Prospectus, the
Accompanying Documents and
the Promotional Materials;
<P>

(d)	the Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the Promotional Materials
did not contain any misleading, incorrect or incomplete
information, statement
or representation or that they had taken reasonable care so to ensure;
<P>

(e)	the Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the Promotional Materials
disclosed all information which was necessary to make
each of them true and not
misleading or that they had taken reasonable care so to ensure; and
<P>

(f)	the Prospectus, the Accompanying Documents and the Promotional Materials
contained information that was fair and balanced or
that they had taken
reasonable care so to ensure."
<P>

173	In submissions the cross-claims against the NRMA were touched on, but only
briefly, and as to some of the ways they were not
taken up at all.  Now is not
the time to explore them further.  The allegations of contributory negligence
and the cross-claims are
two reasons why a deal of attention was given in the
hearing to the origins and development of the proposal, and to the parts played
not only by the defendants but also by directors and officers of the NRMA.
<P>

<center><b>VI  FACTS</b></center>
<P>

<b>Preface</b>
<P>

174	It should be appreciated that the facts which follow are of necessity
selective from all that occurred in relation to the proposal.
 A vast amount of
work went into the proposal, much of it of no relevance or of only peripheral
relevance to these proceedings, and
it should not be thought that what I will
describe adequately reflects all that was done.  
<P>

175	Events material to advice in relation to the free shares question, the
disadvantages question, and risk to the proposal in connection
with
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, and otherwise to the defences and cross-claims, were
interwoven, with each other and with all else that occurred, and must be seen
in the context of the overall development and implementation of the proposal.
Some aspects of the defences called for a description
of the development of the
proposal from early times.  Further, the submissions involved close attention
to what was said in many
documents, and so I have set out many extracts in
order that the events and the submissions may better be understood;  as well,
exposing
sometimes extensive extracts assists in understanding how the
defendants, the directors and officers of the NRMA, and others acted
and
thought at the time.  It is important to avoid the improper influence of
hindsight in deciding these proceedings, and to endeavour
to get back to the
position some years ago.  
<P>

176	The facts which follow are therefore lengthy and detailed, although I
repeat necessarily selective.  To the reader dismayed
by the length and detail,
be content:  you have been spared the sixty-eight lever-arch files of
documents, the nine lever-arch files
of witness statements, a few more files of
miscellaneous exhibits, and about five thousand pages of transcript of oral
evidence.
<P>

177	Recollections of witnesses were variable, but often poor or only in general
terms.  That is not surprising, nor is it surprising
that on some matters
recollections differed.  I have no doubt that most of those who gave evidence
were doing their best to recall
and recount, honestly and as carefully as they
could, their thoughts and deeds in the period 1992-95, which is not to deny the
effect
of plain bad memory and the more subtle effect of associations, outside
influences, and self-interest on the most honest and careful
witness.  The
capacity of the human mind to delude itself is great.  Poor and only general
recollections, and differing recollections,
make it all the more important when
making findings as to what occurred to endeavour to get back to the position
some years ago,
the better to make inferences when proper to do so and to
resolve differences in recollection.
<P>

178	Not all the facts described, and in particular not all the resolutions of
differences in recollection, are of moment in my decision
of these proceedings,
but I have taken the view that my findings should be reasonably comprehensive
for the benefit of any appellate
court which may be invited to see the claims
otherwise than as I see them.  Further, to assist in understanding I have at
times provided
some narrative or explanation as I set out what occurred.
<P>

<b>The origins of the proposal</b>
<P>

179	The President of Association and chairman of Insurance from 1991 was
Mr Donald Mackay.  The senior management of the NRMA comprised
a chief
executive officer and a number of general managers.  The chief executive
officer held that position in both Association and
Insurance. The general
managers included a general manager of Association and a general manager of
Insurance, together with general
managers in various areas such as financial
services, finance and administration, and community and customer relations.  In
the period
to September 1992 the chief executive officer was Mr John
Lamble.  Mr Ray Willing was the general manager of Insurance.  
<P>

180	In late 1991 Insurance embarked on a review of its corporate structure, it
seems because it was thought that it might be inappropriate
for such a major
financial entity to be controlled by Association.  Its board established a
committee of Mr Mackay, Mr Lamble, and
Mr Willing to make a
preliminary investigation.  A number of merchant banks were approached, and
Macquarie Corporate Finance Ltd
("Macquarie") was commissioned to provide a
report.  The report was provided in February 1992.  In its covering letter
Macquarie
suggested that, because it contained a number of statements and
conclusions "of a very sensitive nature", the distribution of the
report should
be confined to Messrs Mackay, Lamble and Willing.  Even at this time it was
recognised that a restructuring was likely
to meet what were called "opposition
arguments", and Macquarie set out "the potential responses of Opposition
groups".  These were
delay, a counter-proposal with "fairer" distribution of
benefits, and a counter-proposal proposing across the board premium reductions
for NRMA members.  As to delay, it was said, "one tactic would be to stall the
implementation process for the recommended proposal
through legal objections.
Arguments about definition of member or the proposed entitlements to benefits
could be possible".
<P>

181	In Macquarie's opinion, and for reasons it gave in detail, Insurance should
demutualise by converting to a company with a share
capital, offering its
shares to existing members, and listing on the Stock Exchange.  The reasons
were, in summary, that the mutual
structure was no longer appropriate to
Insurance's business and financial position because it restricted members'
access to Insurance's
wealth and did not provide an efficient method for
raising capital;  that Insurance had a large and increasing capital surplus;
and
that demutualisation and listing would provide members with "a mechanism
which enables them to realise the value inherent in the
business" and would
give Insurance "a more efficient and flexible structure, particularly in terms
of its capitalisation, the provision
of owner discipline and overall fairness".

<P>

182	The report also briefly referred to alternatives, including "an integral
demutualisation and listing" of both Insurance and
Association very broadly of
the nature of the later proposal.  This alternative was thought unacceptable
because, it was said, investors
in the new holding company "might query its
commercial focus if a motor club (which includes public service activities) is
integrated
with a commercial insurance operation", and because the listed
public company structure might not be an appropriate structure for
Association
"as it may inhibit public service activities".
<P>

183	Notwithstanding Macquarie's suggestion of confidentiality, the Macquarie
report was the subject of a presentation to the board
of Insurance on
20 February 1992.  The presentation was to Mr Mackay, Mr Lamble, and Mr
Willing, plus other directors who were also
directors of Association, Mr Mark
Burrows, Mr Holden, Mr Peter Jack, Dame Leonie Kramer, and Ms Lynn Ralph.  Two
general managers
within Insurance, Mr Richard Cox and Mr Adrian Rees, were also
present.  The minutes recorded that the board "discussed the work
to date by
Macquarie and noted that it concentrated on one possible course of action".

<P>

184	A special board meeting was appointed for 12 March 1992 to discuss
what was called "a range of strategic options" for Insurance,
including its
relationship with Association and its structure and management.  The NRMA
management was asked to prepare a "report
on options ... with pros and cons".

<P>

185	The Macquarie report was before the board on 12 March 1992, and there was a
presentation by Mr Lamble, presumably of management's
report.  The board
then comprised Mr Mackay, Mr Burrows, Mr Graham Douglass, Mr Jack, Mr Holden,
Ms Ralph, Ms Jane Singleton, Mr
Lamble and  Mr Willing, and Mr Peter Corrigan,
Mr Rees, and Mr Daniel Wilkie were also in attendance.  Messrs Corrigan and
Wilkie
were also general managers within Insurance.  It seems that the
management report was not favourable, and other evidence indicated
that Mr
Willing thought that Macquarie did good work "but the objective was totally
unrealistic as spinning off the insurance operation
would have split the group
asunder, in terms of people, culture and marketing".  
<P>

186	It was resolved that management carry out further work on issues to do with
Insurance's long-term future, and that "any change
in capital structure" was
contingent on completion of that work.  The resolution included that a report
to "Council", that is, the
board of Association, should be prepared, and it is
easy to see that the matters raised had a significance going beyond Insurance
and relevant to Association - as a practical matter, of course, Association
knew all that Insurance knew through the common directors
and overlapping
management.
<P>

187	The resolution also included that there should be another special board
meeting in April 1992 "to consider some of the above
issues further".  So far
as the evidence shows, that did not occur.  It seems that there was media
speculation of floating Insurance,
and perhaps this moved the NRMA to kill off
any talk of demutualisation in whole or part, as it did in a public
announcement in June
1992.  The restructuring recommended by Macquarie was not
take up, but the issues which had been raised did not go away.  Insurance's
review had opened up restructuring the NRMA in general, and from the review, it
seems, came consideration of wider restructuring.
<P>

<b>The Christmas Project is established</b>
<P>

188	It was known that Mr Lamble was to retire, and at least by mid-1992
Mr Willing was known as his successor.  Mr Willing officially
took
over as chief executive officer on 1 October 1992, being replaced as
general manager of Insurance by Mr  Corrigan.  In July
1992 the NRMA
established the Future Structure Consultative Group ("the Group"), which
provided a report dated 13 August 1992 to
Mr Willing as chief
executive officer designate.  The senior members of the Group were
Ms Helen Conway, the NRMA's secretary and
general counsel, and
Mr Neville King, its general manager - strategic planning.  There were six
other members, all it seems from
within NRMA management, and the list of
acknowledgments in the report showed that they consulted widely within the
organisation.
 
<P>

189	The report described the Group's responsibility as considering the
strategic direction of the NRMA and recommending several
alternative
organisational structures consistent with that strategic direction.  The
recommendations favoured what was called a customer-based
structure, referring
to internal organisation of management and support functions, and the report
did not directly consider restructuring
in the sense of demutualisation.  It
was said, however, that a number of<i> </i>"strategic imperatives" would be
enhanced by changes to the organisational structure as considered in the
report, amongst which was
"Consolidation of the NRMA and NRMA Insurance".
<P>

190	It is tolerably clear that the report of the Group then flowed on to
consideration of demutualisation, as is understandable
in the light of the
board resolution of 12 March 1992 and the consolidation identified as a
strategic imperative.  The evidence gave
no detail, but demutualisation was a
topic at a meeting between Mr Corrigan and a merchant bank in August 1992;  a
stockbroker wrote
to Mr Willing in early November 1992 offering its services in
a float of the NRMA (this may have been unsolicited);  and at the end
of
November 1992 Mr Willing was debating which of a number of merchant banks to
use for what his memorandum to Mr King dated 30 November
1992 called
"restructure of group companies".  The memorandum asked that he and Mr King
"get together to begin to scope this project".
<P>

191	By a memorandum dated 3 December 1992 Mr King called a meeting
for 9 December 1992 to discuss "the corporate restructure project".
 Those
attending were to be Mr Willing, Mr King,  Ms Conway, and two members
of Mr King's strategic planning department or Ms Conway's
secretariat, Mrs Thomasin Graham and Ms Prudence Godwin.  Mrs Graham and
Ms Godwin had legal qualifications.  A so-called agenda
for the meeting, more a
list of topics for consideration, asked why undertake a restructure, what were
the options, why the preferred
option was preferred, how to proceed, and who to
involve and when (instancing solicitors and a merchant bank).  Attached to the
memorandum
was a list of possible options, the first of which was "Group
unified under one ultimate holding company which is:- (a) company limited
by
shares;  (b) company limited by guarantee;  (c) company limited by shares and
guarantee".  The other options were that one only
of Association or Insurance
become subject to a holding company, that Association and Insurance stay the
same but their subsidiaries
change, or something indicated by "joint venture
options?"  
<P>

192	So began the Christmas Project, the title in the minutes of the meeting of
9 December 1992, it seems chosen for no reason other
than the time of year.
<P>

<b>The Christmas Project report</b>
<P>

193	The minutes of the meeting of 9 December 1992 generally covered the topics
in the agenda.
<P>

194	The reasons for restructuring were to do with capitalisation and
governance.  It was said that the NRMA was over capitalised
and largely
confined to a New South Wales membership, and that the mutual structure
precluded return of capital and inhibited expansion
beyond New South Wales:
figures were given.  It was said that although members "owned" Association and
Insurance respectively they
did not have "a direct financial stake" in the
companies, so that "governance issues are cumbersome" and members did not see
the
management of the companies as a matter with which they should concern
themselves, and that any restructure should have the aim of
"aligning the
interests of owners, that is the members at present, more closely with the
management and control of the company".
 
<P>

195	Four options were described, the first and preferred option and some
comments being recorded in the minutes -
<P>

"*	The creation of a holding company which could be either public and listed
<u>or</u> public and unlisted.
<P>

	Money would be `released' from the present NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance
Limited in the form of shares in the new company (or
cash if a member did not
want shares).
<P>

*	This of course raises a host of issues, most importantly the issue of equity.
In other words, what rules would be used to decide
who gets what shares or
cash.
<P>

*	In this option the mutuality of NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited would
be `exchanged' for shares in the holding company
and the two existing companies
would become companies limited by shares which would be held by the holding
company."
<P>

The other three options were that Association and Insurance become "separately
owned", either as mutuals or with one becoming a
company limited by shares;
that Association itself become the holding company of Insurance and a company
limited by shares;  and
that one of the subsidiaries, or a new subsidiary,
become a vehicle for expansion.
<P>

196	As to progress and who to involve, it was noted that there should be market
research to determine whether there was "members'
permission to embark on such
a restructure", but it was then said, "If we do not have such permission
Marketing will determine what
we need to do so as to change the climate or
attitude of our members in order to obtain that permission".  It was said that
Mr King
was "the owner of the Christmas Project", but that "in view of the high
level of legal content, Helen Conway is to be involved with
all legal aspects
of the project".  A steering committee was proposed, comprising
Mr Willing, Mr King, Ms Conway, and Messrs Corrigan
and Mackay
<i>"</i>as necessary", and a project team was proposed comprising Mr King,
Mrs Graham, Ms Godwin, a "financial person" to be named,
Mr Rowan
Ross, and Mr John Morgan.  Mr Ross was from
BT Corporate Finance Ltd ("BT"), it seems selected as the merchant bank
envisaged in
the agenda.  Mr Morgan was from AAH, according to the minutes
selected as the solicitor envisaged in the agenda "in view of his knowledge
of
the insurance industry;  work for NSW Treasury in relation to the privatisation
of the NSW GIO;  and his familiarity with the
operation of the NRMA Group".
<P>

197	The minutes of the meeting of 9 December 1992 included -
<P>

"Persons who are to know of the project - all those present together with the
President, Mr D G Mackay, Mr Peter Corrigan, General
Manager, Insurance and in
the near future Mr Adrian Rees, General Manager, Financial Services.
<P>

Neville King will put together a list of financially skilled staff who would be
suitable for use on the Christmas Project.
<P>

<u>Timetable</u>
<P>

March is the first staging post. There will be a meeting in March at which a
project plan will be presented. At that time it would
be likely that the
project will be presented to Dame Leonie Kramer, Ray Kirby, Mark Burrows (who
shall probably have had earlier
involvement) and Ms Lynn Ralph."
<P>

198	The persons last named were long-standing NRMA directors.  Mr Ray
Kirby had been a director of Association since 1981 and a
director of Insurance
since 1986, and was Deputy President of Association.  Dame Leonie Kramer had
been a director of Association
since 1984 and a director of Insurance since
1991.  Mr Burrows had been a director of Association since 1985 and a director
of Insurance
since 1986:  he was a merchant banker.  Ms Ralph had been a
director of Association since 1986 and a director of Insurance since
1990.  All
but Mr Kirby had been at the board meeting in 1992 concerning Insurance's
review of its corporate structure, and Mr Kirby
must have been aware of that
matter.
<P>

199	Mr Willing approached Mr  Ross and Mr Morgan.  By
mid-February 1993 both had been engaged and the bases of their engagements
had
been settled.  
<P>

200	As to BT, in an engagement letter its role was said to be to act as
financial adviser to the NRMA "in relation to the restructuring
of the NRMA and
NRMA Insurance", and it was said that it was envisaged that it would first
advise on the most appropriate future
corporate and financial structure for the
companies which would allow them to best satisfy their aims and objectives, and
then if
there were a restructuring would advise on implementing the desired
restructuring.  In relation to the first stage, it was said that
it was
expected that BT's role "may include assisting the NRMA in reviewing the
options available, assessing the<i> </i>likelihood of being able to
successfully implement those options and in preparing the project plan for
presentation in March".  In
relation to the second stage, it was said that BT's
role "would be likely to include providing advice to the NRMA on appropriate
strategies and approvals required to implement the restructuring, member and
press relations and valuation considerations".  
<P>

201	The role of AAH was not recorded in a similar engagement letter, and the
letter to do with its remuneration noted only that
it was retained "in relation
to ... the NRMA Group project known as `Project Christmas'".  The unnamed
financial person was not followed
through, and no additional person joined the
project team.
<P>

202	It does not seem that the steering committee proposed on 9 December
1992 was formally constituted, and it did not act as such.
 No doubt the
persons proposed as its members were kept informed and were consulted from time
to time, but so far as the evidence
showed they did not have much to do with
the preparation of the Christmas Project report.
<P>

203	At the meeting of 9 December 1992 the most important issue seen in the
preferred option was the issue of equity, "what rules
would be used to decide
who gets what shares or cash".  This involved what came to be called the
windfall and later the question
of entitlements.  There was also raised at once
the question of how to change Association or Insurance to companies limited by
shares
under a holding company.  A little later there was consideration of the
nature of a member's interest in Association or Insurance,
and of what the
member would be giving up if there was an "exchange" for shares in the holding
company.  The consideration of all
these matters in the course of preparation
of the report provided background to the free shares question and of advice in
relation
to the risk to the proposal in connection with <i>Gambotto's case</i>.

<P>

204	The project team met on 16 February 1993.  The meeting operated as a
kind of briefing for BT and AAH, present by Mr Ross and
Mr Morgan.
<P>

205	Mr Morgan wrote to Mr King in anticipation of the meeting,
recording the areas which he considered the briefing should cover
and providing
a paper on "legal issues relating to Project Christmas".  The paper contained
some general observations on a possible
restructuring, not a restructuring in
the form later adopted but with Insurance as the centrepiece.  
<P>

206	The paper raised in different terms the issue of equity.  After brief
reference to the current structure of the NRMA, Mr Morgan
noted that on a
winding-up of Insurance any surplus went to Association, and said -
<P>

"This leads to an interesting question as to who owns the `Estate'. On one hand
the Estate or surplus has been produced by the business
activities of Insurance
with its policy holders and the past and present policy holders have largely
contributed to the Estate. However
on winding up the Estate is notionally owned
by the Association. The sharing of the Estate in any proposal may become a
critical
issued [sic]. However it may be made easier by the fact that the
association members and the insurance members have a high decree
of overlap.
However the Association's members do not own the Estate of the Association
because on a winding up of that entity the
surplus or Estate is returned to an
entity with similar objects."
<P>

The areas for the briefing set out by Mr Morgan included areas reflecting
this issue, namely -
<P>

"8.	Who do you believe owns the `estate', policy holders or the Association?
<P>

 9.	Is the `estate' to be distributed in anyway [sic]?"
<P>

207	The paper also raised the question of how to change from a company limited
by guarantee, and part of what was said under the
heading "Corporations law
issues" was -
<P>

"A company limited by guarantee may only change its status under Section 167
and the change of status permitted is a conversion
to a company limited by both
shares and by guarantee.  It would appear that the better view is that a
company limited by guarantee
cannot convert wholly to a company limited by
shares through a scheme of arrangement.  It may well be necessary for
legislative intervention
to permit this.
<P>

The change of status is achieved effectively by a special resolution of members
agreeing to a reconstruction of the entity.  There
may however be an issue if
policy holder members voted to amend the Memorandum &amp; Articles of Insurance
so as to change the distribution
of the Estate without the approval of the
Association.  This may either give rise to class rights issues and the need for
the consent
of Association or alternatively may give rights to the Association
to seek relief from oppression."
<P>

208	Present at the meeting were Mr Willing, Mr King, Ms Conway, Mrs Graham, Ms
Godwin, Mr Ross, and Mr Morgan.  According to Ms
Godwin's notes of the
meeting, there was general discussion of "ownership and issues which might
arise", the major issues being -
<P>

"*	Who will get the windfall gain?
<P>

 *	How is any windfall meaningfully returned.
<P>

 *	What should the ultimate structure be.
<P>

 *	Implementation issues particularly political exposures."
<P>

Still according to the notes, it was agreed that Mr Ross and
Mr Morgan "would prepare an outline of the subject headings for a report
on the Christmas project for the next meeting", the next meeting being
appointed for 23 February 1993.
<P>

209	An outline for a report was prepared for the meeting of 23 February
1993.  It included eight headings and numerous sub-headings.
 The heading "Aims
and Objectives" had subheadings concerned with surplus capital, governance,
access to capital, and a national
insurer;  the heading "Alternative
Structures" had subheadings concerned with a holding company and transfer of
business to a new
company, and within the first subheading alternatives of
Association, Insurance and a new company;  the heading "Critical Issues"
had
subheadings "Windfall gain" and "Asymmetry between voting rights and economic
interest and winding up";  the heading "Implementation
Issues" had many
subheadings including subheadings concerning legal, taxation, accounting,
financial, operational, and public relations
matters, each with further
sub-division;  and the heading "Risk Analysis" had amongst its sub-headings
"Approval of members/policyholders"
and "Possible spoiling tactics".  
<P>

210	Present at the meeting on 23 February 1993 were Mr Willing,
Ms Conway, Mr King, Mrs Graham, Mr Ross, Ms Marianne
Birch, Mr Peter
Barry, and Mr Morgan.  Ms Birch and
Mr Barry were also from BT.  The minutes of the meeting noted who was to
prepare what section
of the report, for example, the aims and objectives by Mr
King, Ms Conway and Mrs Graham and the critical issues and alternative
structures by BT with input from Ms Conway and Ms Godwin.  The record of
discussion against "Critical Issues" included, "Windfall
gain - entitlement
discussed - need to be careful on who is required to contribute on a winding up
- system to decide who is entitled
to the windfall".  
<P>

211	The next meeting of the project team was on 2 March 1993.  Present
were Mr King, Mrs Graham, Mr Ross, Ms Birch, Mr Barry,
Mr
Morgan, and Mr Mark Schultz.  Mr Schultz was a solicitor from
AAH with taxation expertise.  Prior to the meeting there had been circulated
by
BT a revised outline for the report, amended in accordance with the discussion
on 23 February 1993 (the amendments were mainly
to do with the order in which
subjects would be dealt with), together with BT's draft of the critical issues
and alternative structures
sections of the report.  A draft paper on matters to
do with companies limited by guarantee had also been circulated by Mr
Morgan.
<P>

212	In BT's draft of the critical issues section of the report there was
considerable discussion under the sub-heading "Windfall
Gain".  Earlier in that
section it had been said that the economic interest in the NRMA did not match
ownership, and that it was
proposed to "align the ownership of NRMA and NRMA
Insurance with the holders of the economic interest in each, such that owners
are
able to participate in the economic interest of the entities during the
course of carrying on business and upon winding up".  It
was then
said -
<P>

"Based on the proposal to match the ownership of both the NRMA and NRMA
Insurance with the holders of the economic interest, a windfall
gain is likely
to arise for those parties entitled to participate. This windfall gain will
reflect the total value of each of the
businesses including the surplus
reserves. It is proposed that parties would be provided with the opportunity to
participate in the
ownership of the entities at no cost or receive a cash
equivalent, or alternatively they would be required to provide a nominal
contribution
compared to the value of the security acquired."
<P>

There were then identified "issues in relation to the windfall gain", including
who was entitled, the basis of entitlement, the
timing of entitlement, the
treatment of surplus reserves, and the treatment of income on surplus reserves.
Each of these was considered.
<P>

213	In the draft alternative structures section of the report BT put forward
three options.  One involved changing Association into
a company limited by
shares and by guarantee, Association acquiring Insurance, and members of both
companies being offered shares
in Association.  Another involved the reverse,
with Insurance becoming the holding company of Association.  The third involved
a
new company acquiring both Association and Insurance, with members becoming
shareholders in the new company.  A number of issues
were to be addressed for
each alternative.
<P>

214	To interpolate, the draft included that members might get whatever they got
from the restructuring "at no cost" or receive a
cash equivalent:  this can be
seen, with hindsight, as the beginning of the free shares question.  What
members could get from the
restructuring was left in general terms, described
in the passage set out above as "the opportunity to participate in the
ownership
of the entities", and how they would participate was not stated but
involved them being offered shares in a company or cash.  Hence
the notion of a
windfall, in the sense that the shareholders would have "rights" to the NRMA's
assets which they did not have as
members.  As members they did not receive
dividends, and could not receive a return of capital;  the members of Insurance
could not
receive any surplus on a winding-up of Insurance, since any surplus
went to Association, and the members of Association could not
receive any
surplus on a winding-up of Association, since any surplus went to an
institution with similar objects or for charitable
purposes.  And in another
sense, there would be a windfall to some members in comparison to others, for
example, in that persons
who were members of Association but not of Insurance
would end up sharing the wealth of Insurance with members of Insurance:  thus
the windfall involved the question of entitlements.  
<P>

215	All this had been foreseen earlier, including by Mr Morgan in his reference
to the "Estate".  It was now being brought into
focus.  The windfall, and the
question of entitlements to which it led, then threw up fairness between
members as a potential source
of complaint of oppression, and as will be seen
brought attention to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.
<P>

216	Much of Mr Morgan's draft paper is not of significance in these
proceedings.  It was a collection of corporations law topics
with reference to
the position of companies limited by guarantee, and had no other theme or
particular conclusion.  It included references
to oppression and to changing
the status of a company by special resolution on the one hand or by a scheme of
arrangement on the
other hand.  
<P>

217	As to oppression, it was said in the draft paper -
<P>

"Remedy under the Corporations Law (section 260) in cases of oppression is
available within a company limited by guarantee. In establishing
oppression,
the members have to establish an unfair abuse of powers and an impairment of
confidence in the probity with which the
company's affairs are being conducted,
rather than resentment on the part of a minority at being outvoted on some
issue of domestic
policy: <i>Re Ingleburn Horse and Pony Club Limited</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20NSWLR%20641" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 NSWLR 641".</a>
<P>

There is no doubt that the NRMA was made aware of the potential for complaint
of oppression, and there will be further instances
of it being informed on that
subject.
<P>

218	What was said in the draft paper about change of status followed on from
the paper for the meeting of 9 December 1993.  There
was first a description of
the steps involved in a change of status by special resolution pursuant to
s 167(1) of the Law.  Section
167(1) specifically referred to change of
status where a company limited by guarantee converted to a company limited both
by shares
and by guarantee, but did not refer to change of status where a
company limited by guarantee converted to a company limited by shares
alone.
Mr Morgan had suggested in the earlier paper that a company limited by
guarantee could not convert to a company limited by
shares alone by special
resolution pursuant to s 167(1).  Could it convert by a scheme of arrangement?
In the earlier paper Mr Morgan
had suggested that it could not.  
<P>

219	In the draft paper for the meeting of 2 March 1993 it was said that
s 411 of the Law "deals with schemes of arrangement, and
there is some
judicial disagreement as to whether changes of status not referred to in
section 167 may nevertheless be carried out
under a scheme approved by a court
under section 411".  This was followed by consideration of cases evidencing the
judicial disagreement,
the last of which was <i>Australian Securities
Commission v Marlborough Goldmines Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 101</a> in which, in a
judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia delivered
on 14 December 1992, it had been held
that s 167 did not cover the
field and that s 411 gave power to sanction a scheme of arrangement to
convert a limited company to
a no liability company.  Mr Morgan's summary
of the holding included that -
<P>

"... the difference between section 167 and section 411 is that section 411
involves close control by a court, and section 167 does
not require close
supervision. The reason that section 167 provides for only five out a larger
number of possible changes of status
is that the other possible changes involve
potential prejudice to creditors or members. Accordingly, those changes of
status which
may be potentially prejudicial should not occur other than under
the supervision of the court (under section 411)."
<P>

220	Again to interpolate, at one point it was suggested by the NRMA in these
proceedings that this thinking should have brought
attention to <i>Gambotto's
case </i>in a different connection, not that of oppression but that of whether
Association and Insurance could change their status from companies
limited by
guarantee by members' resolutions as distinct from  by a scheme of arrangement.
It showed that Mr Morgan was alive to
whether the status of Association and
Insurance could be changed from that of companies limited by guarantee by
members' resolutions,
as distinct from by a scheme of arrangement.  But at this
time Mr Morgan was saying that the status of a company could be changed
by
members' resolution to that of a company limited by shares and by guarantee,
but not to that of a company limited by shares alone.
 The question was whether
status could be changed to that of a company limited by shares alone by a
scheme of arrangement.  The question
was not one to which <i>Gambotto's
case</i>, then about to be heard in the Court of Appeal, was material, and I do
not think it should have directed attention to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  The
thinking did assume that change of status to that of a company limited by
shares and by guarantee could be achieved by members'
resolution.  The
assumption was later expressly questioned, and that was the time for attention
to <i>Gambotto's case</i>, in a connection beyond oppression, if such attention
was called for.
<P>

221	The discussion at the meeting of 2 March 1993 included that tax
implications of the alternative structures could be a major
issue in
determining which option to adopt:  that seems to have explained the attendance
of Mr Schultz.  A particular matter recorded
in the minutes of the meeting
was "that a fundamental objective would be that the shares vesting in the hands
of new shareholders
must be free of tax so those new shareholders don't have to
sell shares in order to pay after tax (Capital Gains Tax Issue)."  According
to
the minutes, it was thought that the most likely holding companies were
Association or the new company, but it was said that it
was necessary to
consider "the implementation issues" of each course.  It was decided to
approach the Corporate Law Reform Committee
to seek an amendment to the Law "to
allow a company limited by guarantee to change status to a company limited by
shares only", that
is, to seek an expansion of the scope of s 167 dealing with
change of status by members' resolution.  
<P>

222	The next meeting of the project team was appointed for 9 March 1993,
and Mr Schultz prepared a preliminary discussion paper
for the meeting.  I
earlier noted, in an interpolation, that what the members could get from the
restructuring was left in general
terms, but Mr Schultz's perspective brought
attention to what members had and would give up in the restructuring.  He asked
whether,
with the issue of shares on the conversion of Association or Insurance
to a company limited both by shares and by guarantee or the
interposition of
the new company, there was a disposal of an interest by a member.  The
tentative answer was that there was not,
because "a member does not have any
fractional interest in a company limited by guarantee unless and until it
converts and issues
share capital".  It followed that the value of the shares
received was not consideration upon disposal of an asset for income tax
or
capital gains tax purposes.  The paper said, "At most, a member has only
contractual rights to vote, and to obtain defined services.
 These rights might
even be left in place after the issue of shares to avoid any suggestion of a
disposal".  So there was raised
what can be seen, again with hindsight, as an
element in the free shares question.
<P>

223	The meeting of 9 March 1993 was attended by Mr King,
Mrs Graham, Ms Godwin, Mr Ross, Ms Birch, Mr Barry,
Mr Morgan and Mr Schultz.
 According to the minutes of the meeting,
in the preparation of the report (which seems not to have progressed to a
further or more
extensive draft, presumably because awaiting the taxation
input) Mr Barry was to prepare a draft paper "fleshing out the aims and
objectives of the proposed alteration to status and structure", and
Mr Morgan was to "provide comments on the aims and objectives
of the
restructure and change of status together with an outline of the mechanism for
doing so for the two most probable of the proposed
structures".  Mr Morgan was
also to approach the ASC "on a no-names basis" to discuss change to the Law to
make it easier for a company
limited by guarantee to convert to a company
limited by shares.  The minutes described the draft paper as for presentation
to a "Board
Committee", I think meaning the group comprising Mr Kirby,
Dame Leonie Kramer, Mr Burrows and Ms Ralph foreshadowed on
9 December
1992 - no formal committee had been or was established by the
board of either Association or Insurance.
<P>

224	The next meeting of the project team was on 16 March 1993.  It was
attended by Mrs Graham, Ms Godwin, Mr Ross, Ms Birch,
Mr
Barry, and Mr Morgan.  Prior to the meeting BT circulated a
further and more extensive partial draft of the report, and Mr Morgan
circulated a paper on the aims and objectives of the restructuring and a paper
on the legal steps necessary for the restructuring.
 The expanded draft report
included the aims and objectives, and this material was generally as
contemplated on 9 March 1993.  
<P>

225	The draft report followed the earlier outline, and was expressed to set out
the issues associated with each key point detailed
in the outline and to be
preliminary to a more detailed report on the issues and an overall proposal.
It incorporated, with slight
changes, what had been said about critical issues
and a windfall gain in BT's earlier document, saying that the basis of
entitlement
should be both simple and equitable and "parties entitled to the
windfall gain should be able to understand the basis of entitlement
and it
should be seen to be fair".  A number of possible bases of entitlement were
suggested.  As to alternative structures, the
same possibilities as before were
set out, but the draft simply noted the issues to be addressed in making a
choice and the draft
report did not yet canvass those issues.  
<P>

226	Mr Morgan's paper on aims and objectives included that Association and
Insurance had excess capital "and there is no simple
solution to its
distribution to its members now and in the future without a restructuring of
the organisations".  His paper on legal
steps took as its basis "that a new
holding company (`Newco') is established which becomes the direct shareholder
in Association
and Insurance and Newco issues shares to the members and
policyholders of Association and Insurance".  He outlined a procedure for
changing the status of Association and Insurance to that of companies limited
by shares and by guarantee by special resolutions in
general meeting, pursuant
to s 167 of the Law.  The procedure was general, it was said that as the
proposal developed other steps
might be identified and greater detail would be
provided, and so far as presently relevant the "principal steps" were said to
be
"the change of corporate status and restructuring of membership and
membership rights of Association and Insurance", "the issue of
shares by
Association and Insurance to Newco", and "the offer by Newco of shares to
members, policyholders and the public".  
<P>

227	When briefly addressing each of these steps in his paper, Mr Morgan said as
to the first step that what was required was a general
meeting of each of
Association and Insurance to approve the change of status to a company limited
by shares and by guarantee and
appropriate alterations to the memoranda and
articles, and that this could be done pursuant to s 167 of the Law.  He
observed that
there were "legal doubts as to whether a change to a company
limited by shares is possible" and "Depending on the outcome of current
litigation before the High Court, a change of status to a company limited by
shares may be possible by way of a Court approved scheme
of arrangement", and
referred also to "exploring possibility of legislative change to s 167".
Although not identified, this was a
reference to an appeal from the decision of
the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in <i>Australian
Securities</i> <i>Commission v Marlborough Goldmines Ltd: </i> it<i> </i>was
not a reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i>, in which the judgment of the Court
of Appeal was then pending.  
<P>

228	As to the third step, there was no further description of the issue of
shares to members, which seemed to be treated as part
of the one offering to
members, policyholders and the public all governed by a prospectus.  In this
paper, that members might get
whatever they got from the restructuring "at no
cost" was not evident, and (perhaps influenced by Mr Schultz's paper) members
would
not necessarily give up their membership rights:  see the
passage -
<P>

"The amendment of the Articles of Association will involve an alteration of
rights between the existing members of the companies
and the shareholder
members.  Consideration will need to be given to whether existing members
should continue to have membership
rights at all and, if so, in what form.
Whatever is done will require a special resolution of members and would be
incorporated into
the resolutions for change of status."
<P>

229	It seems that the meeting of 16 March 1993 saw the new holding company
as the preferred option, and it may be that Mr Morgan's
reference to
continuation of membership was taken up.  A note of the meeting included -
<P>

"Preferred route is 
<P>

*	list a new Holding corporation
<P>

*	retain NRMA with membership 
<P>

...
<P>

This proposition may be most palatable as we can say to members that nothing
will change as far as members are concerned."
<P>

230	There followed development of the draft report to a further draft without,
so far as appears from the evidence, further formal
meetings of the project
team.  
<P>

231	The NRMA, through Ms Godwin, prepared and circulated a draft introduction
to the report intended to explain why a restructuring
was thought necessary,
and BT incorporated it with amendments into the further draft.  Some aspects of
the draft introduction may
be noted now, as they were said to be material in
these proceedings to the disadvantages question.  
<P>

232	It identified as the major factors "which propel us towards changing the
structure of the Group" the evolution of the NRMA's
role and the growth of
surplus capital within the group, and then described problems in the
distribution of capital (profits), administrative
inefficiency, and what was
described as misalignment between ownership and control.  It
continued -
<P>

"<b>SOLUTION - RESTRUCTURE OF THE NRMA GROUP</b>
<P>

By listing a holding company which would own NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance
Limited, many of these problems are resolved.
<P>

<b>Advantages</b>
<P>

Such structure would have the advantage of not requiring any major alteration
to the present structure. As far as our members would
be concerned there would
be little change in the manner of delivering services.
<P>

The use of a listed company limited by shares would make the return of capital
to members in the form of shares very simple. Furthermore
such a structure
would provide a means for the equitable distribution of future profits.
<P>

The other benefit of using this method for returning capital and future profits
is that it can be done without stripping the Group
of its assets.
<P>

Ownership and control of the Group would become much more aligned. Takeover
becomes a far more difficult and expensive exercise.
Hence greater stability
for the Group is achieved.
<P>

<b>Other Issues Resulting from a Restructure</b>
<P>

<u>Profit Making Imperative</u>
<P>

As a listed company with a need to pay dividends there would be an increased
emphasis on the making of profits. This could lead
to conflict with some of the
Group's current activities which can be categorised as social or representative
in nature and which
are not directly profit making.
<P>

On the other hand, as the Group's present strength is due both to financial
acumen and the taking of an active role in the community,
possible conflict
between profit making and non-profit making activities can be viewed as
unlikely.
<P>

<u>Loss of `Membership' Feeling</u>
<P>

The Group at present has a strong service-based culture. Members feel as though
they belong to the organisation. It would be necessary
therefore to ensure that
any restructure of the Group did not result in members losing this sense of
belonging.
<P>

<u>Dividends</u>
<P>

At the moment the Group does not pay dividends. Profits are therefore retained
and can be built upon. As a listed company we would
have to pay dividends.
However, as our major aim is to return capital and future profits to our
owners, the payment of dividends
ought not to be viewed as a disadvantage.
<P>

<u>Trade Practices Issue</u>
<P>

The Trade Practices Commission currently does not prevent us from requiring
persons who take out insurance with NRMA Insurance to
also be or become members
of NRMA Limited. If there is a restructure of the type being considered, it is
likely that the Trade Practices
Commission would no longer permit us to do
this. This would possibly mean a loss of sales of some of our services but need
not necessarily
do so. Even without a restructure it is quite possible that the
Trade Practices Commission may reconsider its view on our current
practice and
decide that it ought not to continue.
<P>

<b>TO SUMMARISE:</b>
<P>

*  The strategic intent of the Group has widened in both a geographic sense and
in the range and types of assistance which the Group
wishes to provide. A
listed company structure is more appropriate for a company which aims to be a
national assistance organisation;
<P>

*  The NRMA Group is over-capitalised;
<P>

*  Over-capitalisation in a mutual organisation can lead to:
<P>

     -  mis-alignment of ownership and control
<P>

     -  and inefficiency;
<P>

*  The present structure does not easily permit the equitable return of capital
or distribution of future profits to the owners
of the Group;
<P>

*  The listing of the holding company for the Group solves these problems."
<P>

233	BT also incorporated into the further draft report the substance of
Mr Morgan's paper in relation to legal steps and Mr Schultz's
paper
on taxation issues.  The existing references to windfall gain were retained,
with some modifications, and it was emphasised
that the classes of people who
would be entitled to participate in the windfall gain would need to be
determined and that the basis
of entitlement should be both simple and
equitable.  
<P>

234	There were a number of other changes and additions to the further draft
report, which was a more complete document than its
predecessors, although
often noting matters for consideration and decision and listing whole sections
to be "addressed in detail
following discussion with members of the NRMA
Council" (ie directors).  An addition of possible significance in these
proceedings
was Section 4.5, headed "Membership Status".  
<P>

235	The section began with the bald statement -
<P>

"Under the proposed structure members of the Association and Insurance would
give up their current membership rights in exchange
for shares in the holding
company, as set out in the table below."
<P>

236	A table then set out a comparison between current (membership) rights and
obligations and proposed (shareholder) rights and
obligations, and comments
were made including that the proposed rights and obligations "were more
favourable than" the current rights
and obligations and -
<P>

"d.	As both Insurance and the Association will still exist, consideration
should be given as to the advantages and disadvantages
of having existing
members retain some membership rights/obligations of the Association and
Insurance, in addition to their rights
and obligations as shareholders of the
new holding company.

An alternative to members retaining membership of Association and Insurance, is
for a contractual relationship to be established
between Association and its
members.  Upon payment of an annual membership fee, members would be entitled
to receive the services
of the Association in the form currently provided.  The
distinction being that contractually they are titled `members' and are entitled
to receive services, whereas, under the existing membership, the rights and
obligations of members are specified in the Memorandum
and Articles, and
arguably the member has an interest in the economic benefits of the NRMA
Group."
<P>

237	The evidence did not reveal the source of the description of giving up
membership rights in exchange for shares in the holding
company.  The comments
showed that retention of membership was still a live alternative, and the part
of the draft report incorporating
the substance of Mr Morgan's paper in
relation to legal steps retained what he had said about existing members
continuing to have
membership rights.  But the notion of giving up membership
rights in exchange for shares, previously implicit in Mr Schultz's paper,
had
been made express.  It later became dominant, and is material to the free
shares question.
<P>

238	Those involved were working towards a presentation of the report to NRMA
management on 1 April 1993, and a further draft was
produced.  The draft
report in its 30 March 1993 version, now entitled the Christmas Report and
incorporating comments received from
Ms Godwin, Mr Morgan, and
Mr Schultz, was presented to and discussed at a meeting attended by
Mr Willing, Mr Rees, Mr Corrigan, Mr
King, Ms Conway,
Mr Doug Pearce, Mrs Graham, Ms Godwin, Mr Ross,
Ms Birch, Mr Barry, Mr Morgan, and Mr Schultz.  The
presentation
was described in a memorandum to Ms Conway as a "run through"
prior to the presentation to "some members of the Board of NRMA Limited".
Mr Rees was then general manager, financial services, and Mr Pearce
was general manager, finance and administration. 
<P>

239	The draft report as at 30 March 1993 had some changes from the draft which
had followed the meeting of 16 March 1993.  They
included that while the
previous Section 4.5 entitled "Membership Status", now Section 4.2 with the
same title, retained the description
of giving up membership rights in exchange
for shares in the holding company, it now omitted the comments showing that
retention
of membership was still a live alternative (although the part of the
draft report incorporating the substance of Mr Morgan's paper
in relation to
legal steps stayed the same).  
<P>

240	Further, there was now some emphasis on protection from minority groups as
an aspect of the asymmetry between voting control
and economic interest.  This
can be seen in particular in two passages in the draft report -
<P>

"The lack of ownership interest leaves open the opportunity for minority
interest groups to secure control of the Board and management
of the
Association and Insurance, and to apply the significant financial resources of
these organisations for their objectives. 
Provided such minority groups do not
purport to adversely affect members rights to road service or other services
provided by the
Association, any move to acquire control of the NRMA Group is
likely to generate little resistance from members, whether or not it
is
supported by the existing Board."
<P>


<P>

"Under the current company structure, control of the surplus capital rests with
the NRMA Board.  While the extensive membership
of NRMA of 2.2 million provides
a natural takeover defence, the proportion of members who vote is significantly
smaller.  It may
not prove to be too difficult for a group to achieve control
of the NRMA Board and thereby obtain control of the NRMA Group's resources."
<P>

Indeed, an agenda for the meeting of 1 April 1993 - the authorship was probably
BT - baldly answered the question , why restructure?,
with the word
"control", and the explanation, "The current structure is easily susceptible to
minority interest groups taking control
of the NRMA's resources".
<P>

241	The minutes of the meeting of 1 April 1983, prepared by Ms Godwin,
included -
<P>

"Issues arising from the presentation which could be given greater prominence
or dealt with in more detail in the report are noted
below. 
<P>

1.	The `swap' of the inchoate rights which members presently have in the NRMA
Group for the very definite rights which a shareholder
in a company which owned
the resources would have, results in members having the flexibility and
discretion in timing their receipt
of financial resources from the company.
Currently distribution of those resources to members is totally at the
discretion of the
Board and Management of the Group. Hence one could say there
is a devolution of power from Board and Management to members (ie
Shareholders).
<P>

...
<P>

6.	Other issues which will require attention at an early stage are
<P>

*	public relations both internally and externally;
<P>

*	possible attacks on the proposal and information which the company needs to
be in a position to provide to counter those attacks;
<P>

*	the accounting issues relating to taxation and ASX scrutiny."
<P>

242	The notion of exchange of membership rights for shares seems to have become
accepted, although as a general description rather
than a legal analysis, and
again it was recognised that there could be opposition to the restructuring.
As to that, in the incomplete
part of the draft report dealing with
implementation issues there was an outline -
<P>

"d.	Implications of defeat
<P>

In the event that the proposed restructure was to fail, the current Board of
Directors of NRMA would be associated with the unsuccessful
proposal, and as
such their future positions on the Board may be jeopardised.  Further the
restructuring process invites interest
from other action groups as it
highlights the value of the NRMA Group and its governance.
<P>

e.	Possible spoiling tactics
<P>

	Possible spoiling tactics include:
<P>

i.	services will be diminished as a result of the restructure;
<P>

ii.	the NRMA Group will focus on profit making and as a result prices charged
will be excessive.
<P>

iii.	the membership culture will change;
<P>

iv.	there are other ways to distribute the surplus capital;  and
<P>

v.	the NRMA Group has been successful to date, thus there is no reason to
change."
<P>

243	The minutes of the meeting of 1 April 1993 also recorded things to be done
before "going to sub-group of directors of the Board".
 They included that BT
would provide a timetable of events leading up to the proposed restructuring,
in particular showing the sequence
of events, and a paper setting out options,
commenting on the timing, providing a brief "risk analysis" of each option, and
giving
a budget and internal resource requirements for each option.  The
options identified were doing nothing, return of capital under
the present
structure, full listing, and "others".  It was agreed that Mr Morgan should "go
to Government on an anonymous basis"
with a view to legislative change to s 167
of the Law.
<P>

244	There was then further work on the draft report, with a meeting of the
project team on 16 April 1993.  Present at the meeting
were Mr King,
Ms Godwin, Mr Ross, Ms Birch, Mr Barry, and Mr Morgan.
Prior to the meeting BT circulated a paper described as "setting
out the risks,
timing, budget and internal resource requirements of the alternatives".  The
paper was a substantial document, later
developed in its own right, and I will
refer to it as the alternatives paper.  Mr Morgan circulated a paper on
the payment of dividends
by Association and Insurance, and Mr Schultz
circulated an expanded paper on taxation issues.  
<P>

245	The BT alternatives paper covered the options of doing nothing, return of
capital under the present structure, and full listing,
in the case of full
listing saying that the option was described in the draft Christmas Project
report.  Benefits of each, risks
of each, timetables, and budgetary and
resource requirements, were stated.  The benefits and risks in the case of full
listing were
broadly the matters already to be found in the draft Christmas
Project report.  The risks included that non-members might claim that
they had
not been treated equitably in the allocation of entitlements.  That it would be
an expensive exercise was clear:  BT estimated
the costs to float the NRMA
Group, based on an average of other public offerings, at $29,100,000 (simple
average) or $24,200,000
(weighted average) excluding broker fees, and described
the annual costs associated with a public company, including listing fees,
the
maintenance of a share register, the preparation of annual reports and annual
returns, and compliance with the Stock Exchange
Listing Rules.  
<P>

246	Mr Morgan's paper on the payment of dividends, it seems brought about
by speculation at the meeting of 1 April 1993 about whether
dividends could be
paid under the present structure as a way of distributing surplus capital, came
to the conclusion that if the
memorandum and articles of a company limited by
guarantee so permitted the company could pay a dividend or distribute its
profits.
 But amendments to the NRMA memoranda and articles would be required,
and Mr Morgan identified a number of practical difficulties
if the NRMA wished
to follow that course.
<P>

247	Mr Schultz's expanded paper on taxation issues was consistent with his
earlier paper, but did include that it was arguable that
"the rights of members
to vote, receive free service etc are capital gains tax assets" and that if
those rights were disposed of
in consideration for shares in Newco "there is a
prospect that a capital gains tax liability may arise".  In developing the
question
whether there would be a taxable disposal of an asset by members, it
was said that the main issue was whether members of Association
and Insurance
had any form of "proprietorial interest" in the company and, if so, whether
that interest was a capital gains tax asset,
and a preliminary answer in the
negative was given.  But it was repeated that it was arguable that some part of
the consideration
for the receipt of shares by members would relate to the
disposal of the right to vote, a contractual chose in action.
<P>

248	From Ms Godwin's notes, the alternatives paper was the focus of the meeting
of 16 April 1993.  It seems that the option of doing
nothing was rejected,
that Mr Morgan was asked to provide more on "problems with dividends under
present structure", and that there
was particular reference to "problems with
`rearranging' membership of Insurance to achieve equity of distribution".
There was discussion
of the timing of any restructuring, in particular its
relationship with the then contemplated expansion of the NRMA's operations
into
Victoria.  That was further considered after the meeting, and was the subject
of a memorandum from Mr King to Mr Willing dated
19 April 1993
in which it was suggested that the expansion should proceed before any
disclosure in the public domain of the Christmas
Project, in order to keep the
NRMA's resources and attention on the expansion and to reduce uncertainty.  
<P>

249	Further drafts of the alternatives paper were prepared, still containing
the substance of the parts of the earlier draft described
above.  After the
benefits of the third option were now added disadvantages, being that the
restructuring process was very complex,
that significant management time would
be diverted from the day to day management of the organisation and the
expansion program to
the restructuring process, and that the costs involved in
the process would be significantly greater than under the second option.
 
<P>

250	On 22 April 1993 the final alternatives paper was provided to
Mr Willing.  It was said that while working on the alternatives
paper it
had been concluded "that the issue of surplus capital was not as important as
it had seemed earlier in view of the demands
which expansion will place on
capital":  presumably this was connected with the expansion into Victoria.  It
was suggested that less
emphasis be placed on the issue of surplus capital in
"the major report" (ie the Christmas Project report), and Mr Willing was asked
whether he would like a further meeting with BT "to discuss the final slant of
the major report".  
<P>

251	It seems that Mr Willing let the matter rest for the next month.
Mr Morgan was asked to advise on interim steps which could
be taken
towards a float while the expansion into Victoria proceeded, and provided a
paper on the subject of a "staged process";
 he was also asked for advice upon
whether Insurance could pay a dividend to members without any amendment to its
current articles,
and advised that the directors could not, but the company in
general meeting could, declare a dividend.  
<P>

252	In mid-May 1993 Mr Willing was reminded of the draft report and paper and
the possible staged process, and was asked whether
there should be a
presentation on the work done so far or further investigation of the staged
process and delay of "the larger project".
 From what follows, it must have
been decided to continue with the larger project.
<P>

253	A final draft dated 28 May 1993 of what was described as the Christmas
Project report, but entitled "Christmas Project - Analysis
of Alternative
Options", was circulated.  The evidence did not go into any further meetings of
the project team at which it was considered.
 The report seems to have been a
synthesis of the draft Christmas Project report and the draft alternatives
paper, but with the possibilities
for restructuring limited to the options from
the alternatives paper.  It still placed emphasis on voting rights and economic
interest,
and on governance, amongst other matters, and referred to the
windfall and the critical issue of entitlements.  It now referred under
the
heading "Membership Status" to members giving up "their indirect ownership
interest in exchange for the right to receive shares
in the holding company",
two changes in expression which were not explained in the evidence but
demonstrate that the way the restructuring
might be brought about was still
imprecise and fluid.
<P>

254	Before going to presentation of the Christmas Project report, I should
briefly refer to what was done about legislative change
to s 167 of the Law:
it was said to be material to what the defendants should have advised in
relation to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  It will be recalled that Mr Morgan's
paper on companies limited by guarantee referred to the possibility of seeking
an amendment
to s 167 of the Law to permit a company limited by guarantee
to change its status to a company limited by shares alone, and that
there had
been agreement thereafter on anonymous approaches to various authorities or the
government.
<P>

255	It must have been decided to consider a more forthright approach.  On
29 March 1993 Mr Morgan sent to the NRMA, with a copy
to
Mr Ross, a draft letter to the Attorney General seeking an amendment.  The
draft letter said that while a company limited by guarantee
could convert to a
company limited both by shares and by guarantee under the procedure contained
in s 167, it was "unclear whether
a company limited by guarantee could
convert to another type of company under a Section 411 scheme of arrangement".
The draft letter
suggested that "It may be that a change of status of a company
limited by guarantee to, for example, a company limited by shares,
could not be
carried out under Section 411 because of the guarantee company's absence of
share capital", and included -
<P>

"Given the uncertain state of the law in relation to Section 411, we believe
that the provisions of Section 167 should be amended
to permit changes of
status not currently expressly permitted, in circumstances where there can be
no possible prejudice to creditors.
The High Court may determine in the appeal
against the <i>Marlborough Gold Mines</i> decision that changes of status not
contemplated under Section 167 of the Corporations Law may nevertheless be
carried out under
Court supervision, under Section 411. Notwithstanding this
possibility, we believe that it would be preferable for the scope of Section
167 to be broadened to include other changes of status which could be achieved
without prejudice to creditors. The procedure specified
in Section 167 is much
simpler than that involved in a scheme of arrangement carried out under Section
411."
<P>

256	However, a letter in the form of the draft was not sent at that time.  On 6
May 1993 the High Court gave judgment in <i>Australian Securities Commission v
Marlborough</i><u> </u><i>Gold Mines Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 485.</a>  It was held,
reversing the decision appealed from, that the Law did not permit the
conversion of a limited company into a no liability
company, and that
s 411 of the Law did not authorise approval of an arrangement which
effected such a conversion.  The possibility
envisaged in the draft letter did
not come to pass.  
<P>

257	Presumably on the instructions of the NRMA, Mr Morgan then sent to the
Attorney General a letter dated 8 June 1993, in the form
of the earlier
draft altered to take account of the decision of the High Court.  The letter
now said, "It is doubtful whether a company
limited by guarantee could convert
to another type of company under a Section 411 scheme of arrangement although
the High Court did
not go this far in its <i>Marlborough</i> judgment".  It
went on to suggest the amendment.  
<P>

258	A letter from the Attorney-General's Department acknowledged Mr Morgan's
letter, and said that it would be taken into account
in the Department's
consideration of the High Court's decision.  This was not encouraging, and it
seems that change of the status
of Association and Insurance to companies
limited by shares alone passed out of consideration.  So the scheme of
arrangement route
instead of the members' resolution route, as a possible
answer to the perceived difficulty where the change was to the status of
companies limited by shares alone, fell away.  The materiality to what the
defendants should have done about <i>Gambotto's case</i> was, on the NRMA's
case, that Mr Morgan had paid regard to the possible impact on what the NRMA
wanted to do of the pending appeal
to the High Court from the decision of the
Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, and that a step in
connection with
the proposal had apparently been deferred to await the result
of the appeal.
<P>

259	The Christmas Project report was presented to the "Board Committee" on 26
July 1993.  In the course of the hearing some of the
defendants attributed
particular significance to the occasion, suggesting that it was rather
clandestine with calculated exclusion
of potential opponents to the
restructuring.  I do not accept that it had that character.  
<P>

260	The presentation on 26 July 1993 was attended by Mr Mackay,
Mr Kirby, Mr Burrows, Dame Leonie Kramer, Ms Ralph (by
telephone),
Mr Willing, Mr Corrigan, Mr King, Mr Rees, Ms Godwin,
Mr Ross and Mr Morgan.  It was held not at the offices of the NRMA,
but at
the offices of the firm of solicitors of which Mr Mackay was a
partner.  Earlier in July Ms Godwin had prepared an agenda for the
meeting, according to which there were to be opening remarks by
Mr Willing, a presentation by Mr Ross, and then discussion.  There
were no minutes of the occasion.  
<P>

261	The report dated 30 January 1995 of the NRMA's corporate process review
committee ("the Booth report"), established after the
Federal Court proceedings
to investigate suggested excessive conduct by management, described the
meeting -
<P>

"Triggered by the BT report and timed ahead of the imminent departure of
Mr Willing overseas, a meeting was held on 26 July 1993
with the
Executive group of the Boards of NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited. At
this meeting, a presentation was given by Rowan
Ross of BT. Mr Mark
Burrows and members of NRMA management also attended the meeting. Prior to the
meeting, Mr Willing consulted
with the Chairman, Mr Don Mackay about
whether the organisation should continue to develop the proposal.
Mr Mackay replied that he
would like the Executive group of the Boards to
determine this. The meeting held on 26 July 1993 provided management with
supportive
feedback for the continued development of the proposal".
<P>

262	The recollections of those at the meeting were not good, and did not add
much to this summation in the Booth report.  The summation
is itself not
necessarily reliable, because the result of enquiries eighteen months later and
based on informants and information
not now identifiable.  
<P>

263	Mr Kirby had the most concrete recollection, to the extent that he gave
evidence that he was "offended" by the proposal, said
he was not interested,
and left the meeting;  he could not recall anything of what was explained at
the meeting because he rejected
the proposal.  I think the firmness evident in
Mr Kirby's evidence may have increased with the passage of time.  While he did
not
favour what was presented, the occasion extended over something like an
hour, and I doubt that his reaction at the time was as abrupt
as might have
been thought from his evidence.  Mr Rees recalled what he described as very
broad discussion around the purpose of
a potential restructure, the
alternatives of the form it might take, and that no decisions were taken.  Mr
Ross recalled giving a
presentation on alternative structures, but had no
detailed recollection:  in general, he recalled some of those present
expressing
a view that full consideration had not been given to other
alternatives, and he did recall that Mr Kirby had a concern which he (Mr
Ross)
could not specify.  Mr Morgan's entries in his notebook did not enable
reconstruction of what occurred at the meeting, but
supported that Mr Kirby and
Ms Ralph were not receptive to what was presented.  There were no other
worthwhile recollections.
<P>

264	Why was the particular group at the presentation?  It was not a last-minute
selection, but gave effect to what had been proposed
(although the date was
later) by the Group in December 1992 and had been reiterated, by the reference
to presentation to the "Board
Committee", thereafter.  
<P>

265	In a chronology prepared by Mr Pearce for the review resulting in the Booth
report he said -
<P>

"It is my understanding that this group was selected as they are the senior
office bearers of Boards, and from the Executive Committee
of the Boards with
the one director who has had significant experience in such a proposal. As
stated earlier, the aim was to test
the acceptability of the proposal before
expanding resources. The group was restricted in order to maintain absolute
confidentiality
over the proposal. It was clear at that stage, any public
discussion of the issue could have caused a `run' on memberships to get
a
`piece of the action'. This could have had legal consequences along the lines
of insider trading and perhaps more importantly could
have significantly
diluted the potential entitlement of existing members of both mutuals."
<P>

266	Mr Pearce did not give evidence, and this recitation of his understanding
is not necessarily weighty.  But the reasons in his
understanding made sense,
and it can readily be accepted that the Group thought that a directorial
reaction to its work from the
senior directors would suffice and that undue
dissemination of what became the Christmas Project report should be avoided.
It would
be unrealistic to think that the general question of restructuring was
not known within the NRMA, given the number of people (including
some not on
the project team) who must have had involvement in the Christmas Project, and
the reference to a "Board Committee" does
not gain a sinister connotation
because there was no formally constituted committee - it could be simply a way
of referring to the
group.  Mr Mackay, who as President would have been central
to any illicit limitation in the membership of the group, firmly rejected
such
a suggestion, and I accept this.
<P>

267	I do not think there was anything more to the particular group at the
presentation than I have indicated, and do not accept
that there was calculated
exclusion of potential opponents to the restructuring.
<P>

<b>Change from the Christmas Project to the Legal Status Project</b>
<P>

268	The immediate progress on the Christmas Project after 26 July 1993 was
slow.  Perhaps this simply continued the lesser attention
to restructuring than
to the expansion into Victoria;  perhaps the so-called "supportive feedback"
from the presentation of 26 July
1993 included critical comment calling for a
fresh approach, as Mr Kirby's evidence and what next happened might
suggest.  
<P>

269	BT prepared a different, shorter, report dated 20 August 1993 entitled
"Project Christmas - Alternative Structures".  I will
call this the alternative
structures report, to be distinguished from the alternatives paper.  
<P>

270	In its introduction the alternative structures report said that the current
structure of the NRMA gave rise to a number of problems,
including that being a
mutual organisation with a membership base restricted to New South Wales was
"not consistent with the vision
to become a national assistance organisation";
that it had capital in excess of its current and expected future requirements;
that
its ownership should be aligned with "the economic interest in the NRMA
Group's earnings and its capital base";  and that its governance
should "match
the interest of those who participate in the economic benefits of the NRMA
Group".  It was specifically noted that
under the alternative structures the
primary objective of the NRMA would be to maximise the return to shareholders,
as a matter material
to the future funding requirements of Association if
Insurance were no longer to subsidise its activities, including its activities
of a community nature.  
<P>

271	There were then canvassed in point form and with diagrams a number of
alternative structures, the points setting out advantages
and disadvantages for
each.  One so-called alternative structure was to retain the existing structure
but distribute surplus capital;
 another was to list the NRMA Group;  another
was to list Insurance;  another was to list Association;  another was to merge
Association
and Insurance.  The alternative of listing the NRMA Group was said
to involve the creation of a holding company of Association and
Insurance, the
conversion of those companies to companies limited by shares and by guarantee,
and the offering to members and policy
holders of an interest in the holding
company.  This was said to have the advantages of addressing the current
structure problems;
 facilitating access to new capital;  maintaining the
existing relationship between Association and Insurance;  and providing a
stable
shareholders' register.  It was said to have the disadvantages of being
more complex;  of being "timely" (presumably time-consuming)
and costly
compared to alternatives not involving a structural alteration;  of the
possible need to discontinue "tied selling" between
Association and Insurance;
that community services provided by Association might need to be specifically
enshrined in the holding
company's charter;  and that there was a risk of
disrupting "the existing `mutual' culture, thus jeopardising the NRMA Group's
comparative
advantage".  
<P>

272	The alternative structures report did not have the detail of its
predecessor, although the work that had gone into the Christmas
Project report
could be seen.  It is evident that there had been a fresh approach, a return to
the reasons for restructuring, to
more alternatives, and to broader assessment
of the pros and cons of the alternatives, and that the focus was on what should
be done
rather than how it should be done.  In a memorandum to Mr King
dated 30 August 1993 Mr Willing expressed thanks for the work on the
Christmas Project to that time, and said, amongst other things, that it was
worthwhile to look at some of the alternatives, including
the current
structure, in greater detail and that more research was needed to ensure that
any decision relating to the NRMA's structure
was in the long term best
interests of members and policyholders.  He said that it was important to "look
hard at the question of
entitlements which our members may have".  It is not
clear whether Mr Willing had the alternative structures report at this
time,
but what he said reflected the fresh approach.  
<P>

273	Consistently with this, Ms Godwin's reaction to the alternative structures
report, as conveyed in a memorandum to Mr Morgan,
was that more detailed
analysis was required "if we are to succeed in persuading others that these
alternatives are unattractive".
 More work was done, and the alternative
structures report passed through a number of further drafts, principally under
the direction
of BT but with comments and input from Ms Godwin and
Mr Morgan.  As well, Ms Godwin and Mr Morgan spent some time discussing
the
question of entitlements with a view to recommendations for the basis of
entitlement.  Mr Willing was kept generally informed.  
<P>

274	By the second half of September 1993 the alternative structures report was
in developed form.  The Christmas Project had come
to be called the Legal
Status Project (although some continued to use the old name), and it was
proposed that there be a meeting
of NRMA management in relation to the project
on 8 October 1993.  
<P>

275	The meeting proposed for 8 October 1993 seems to have been held on
6 October 1993.  It was attended by Mr Willing, Mr Rees,
Mr Corrigan, Mr King, Mr Pearce, Mr Stuart Salvage, and
Ms Godwin.  Mr Salvage was in the communications area within the
NRMA, and
became the initial so-called project manager for the project, in due
course with the role of coordinating the activities of all those
involved in
it.  His presence suggests that it was thought that the project would be taken
up, and from Ms Godwin's notes of the
meeting the same appears.  It seems that
there was a wide ranging discussion, preliminary but as if on the assumption
that a restructuring
proposal of some kind would go forward, touching on
questions of market research, public relations, when to "go public", the timing
for any listing, engaging accounting and actuarial assistance, and establishing
a steering committee and project management group.
 
<P>

276	Ms Godwin's notes of the meeting of 6 October 1993 included, "Discussion of
project at Terrigal".  	On 25 October 1993 the question
of restructuring was
presented to a wider group of NRMA management as part of their periodical
retreat at Terrigal.  All general
managers attended.  There was little detail
of the meeting in the evidence, and it seems that the occasion was more one of
informing
the general mangers than of inviting their contributions;  however,
no doubt there was discussion.  There was no suggestion in the
evidence that
the Terrigal retreat caused reconsideration of the Legal Status Project at
management level.
<P>

<b>The proposal in late 1993</b>
<P>

277	After all the time and detailed consideration leading to the Christmas
Project report, the Legal Status Project was in place
with comparative ease:
the earlier work, of course, underlay the alternative structures report and its
acceptance at management level.
 The basis of the proposal was now becoming
clearer.
<P>

278	Perhaps to fulfil the desire for a more detailed analysis to which Ms
Godwin had referred, BT provided an updated version of
the Christmas Project
report dated 27 October 1993, said to be for the NRMA's comments.  It
appears to have been a combination of
elements of the earlier Christmas Project
report and the alternative structures report, resulting in a more detailed
version of the
latter report.  This report identified future growth, surplus
capital, and governance as the principal issues raised by the current
structure, and while it listed and considered a great number of alternatives as
before (even more alternatives, but still including
retaining the current
structure), it expressed a preference, with reasons, for converting the NRMA's
mutual structure into one of
shareholding listed on the Stock Exchange.  
<P>

279	Aspects of the developing proposal material to these proceedings should be
brought out.
<P>

280	The process for the conversion was described in the executive summary in
the report -
<P>

"*	Converting the Association (NRMA Limited) and Insurance (NRMA Insurance
Limited) into companies limited by shares and guarantee.
<P>

*	Establishing a holding company (HOLD Co) which is limited by shares only.
HOLD Co would hold all of the issued shares in the Association
and
Insurance.
<P>

*	Offering to members and other parties deemed to be entitled, shares in HOLD
Co on a predetermined equitable basis.
<P>

*	Those parties who are entitled to participate could be given the choice of
subscribing for shares in HOLD Co or renouncing the
offer and receiving a cash
sum based on the net market value of their entitlement.
<P>

*	Shares renounced, could be pooled together and offered to institutions though
a tender process or underwriting mechanism.
<P>

*	HOLD Co would be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
<P>

*	A special distribution of the capital surplus to the NRMA Group's operations
and the planned expansion program could be made to
shareholders following the
allotment of shares in HOLD Co.
<P>

*	This distribution may either be in the form of a franked dividend, to
minimise the amount of tax payable on the distribution,
or a capital return.
<P>

*	Payment of a special distribution should eliminate any discount the market
would be likely to attribute to the surplus capital
if it were retained in the
NRMA Group following listing.
<P>

*	Members in their capacity as shareholders in HOLD Co, would have the right
to:
<P>

	-	vote
<P>

	-	receive dividends;
<P>

	-	realise the market value of their shareholding at any time;  and
<P>

	-	participate in any surplus on winding up.
<P>

*	Members would have the right to receive services from the Association and
Insurance on a contractual basis, following the payment
of fees for service.
<P>

*	The Association `membership' culture could be preserved through the corporate
structure of the Association.  The Association could
be converted into a
company limited by shares and guarantee.  HOLD Co would own 100% of the shares
of the Association and would hold
all the voting rights.  Members would have no
voting rights, but would contribute in the event of a deficiency upon winding
up for
a sum guaranteed at the time of payment of membership fees.  In
addition, the provision of community and non-profit services could
be
specifically provided for as part of the structure."
<P>

281	In the body of the report the same matters were described -
<P>

"The way in which the preferred structure could be implemented is set out
below.
<P>

*	Members and other parties who are deemed to have an entitlement, could be
offered, in proportion to a pre-determined basis of
entitlement, the right to
either subscribe for shares in HOLD Co or to receive a cash payment.
<P>

*	Those that accept the offer of shares would be allotted shares in HOLD Co
following the payment of a subscription price.  The
subscription price is
likely to be small relative to the market value of the shares.
<P>

*	Those who elect to take the cash alternative and renounce the offer to
subscribe for shares would receive an amount of cash based
on the market value
of the shares.
<P>

*	Shares renounced by members/policyholders could be pooled together and
offered to institutions through a tender process or underwriting
mechanism.
For example, institutions could be asked to tender for the available shares
(price and volume).  Upon the close of the
offer period, the price at which all
shares would be allocated would be determined and the shares allotted
accordingly.
<P>

*	Upon allotment, moneys subscribed by institutions (less costs associated with
the tender/underwriting process) would be distributed
to the
members/policyholders who renounced their entitlement to subscribe for shares,
in proportion to their entitlement to subscribe
for shares, in proportion to
their entitlement.
<P>

*	HOLD Co would be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
<P>

<b>Special Dividend</b>
<P>

It is proposed HOLD Co could make a distribution of surplus capital (either
through a special dividend or capital distribution),
to all shareholders
immediately following the allotment of shares.  The reasons for distributing
surplus capital include:
<P>

*	the market is likely to discount the value of the surplus capital if it
perceives that these funds are not required for the NRMA
Group's core business
or to finance the planned expansion program;  and
<P>

*	as a listed company, the NRMA Group will be able to access new capital from
the equity market as required.  This gives the company
the ability to operate
on a lower capital base than as a mutual organisation.
<P>

<b>Members Rights &amp; Obligations in HOLD Co</b>
<P>

Shareholders in HOLD Co would be able to exercise all the rights attaching to a
shareholding in a listed company, including the
entitlement to:
<P>

*	one vote per share;
<P>

*	participate in dividends, as declared;
<P>

*	participate in any surplus capital on winding up;  and
<P>

*	dispose of their shareholding on market at any time.  The value of the
shareholding could be readily ascertained by reference
to the price at which
the NRMA Group is trading on the Australian Stock Exchange.
<P>

<b>The Association and Insurance</b>
<P>

*	The Association and Insurance would be converted to companies limited by both
shares and guarantee.
<P>

*	HOLD Co would own 100% of the issued shares in the Association and Insurance.
The Board of Directors of HOLD Co (appointed by
the shareholders) would be
responsible for both the Association and Insurance.
<P>

*	The Association's `membership' culture could be preserved through the
corporate structure of the Association.  Members would have
no voting rights in
the Association, but would contribute in the event of a deficiency upon winding
up for a sum guaranteed at the
time of payment of membership fees.  In
addition, the provision of community and non-profit services could be
specifically provided
for as part of the structure.
<P>

*	Insurance would provide insurance services to policyholders in accordance
with the policy of insurance."
<P>

282	As to the critical issue of the basis of entitlement, the report later said
- 
<P>

"Under the proposed restructuring of the NRMA Group, a windfall gain arises for
those parties who are deemed to be entitled to participate.
 This windfall gain
is reflected in the value of the direct ownership interest acquired in exchange
for the current indirect interest.
<P>

The windfall gain gives rise to the following critical issues:
<P>

*	who is entitled to participate;  and
<P>

*	on what basis are they entitled to participate.
<P>

Each of these issues are [sic] discussed below.
<P>

<b>Who is entitled to participate?</b>
<P>

The parties who are most likely to be entitled to participate in the allocation
of shares in the NRMA Group include:
<P>

*	current members of the Association and Insurance;
<P>

*	policy holders;  and
<P>

*	employees.
<P>

Preliminary legal advice suggests that the initial offer to subscribe for
shares in the NRMA Group must be made to members (reflecting
their ownership in
a legal sense), unless otherwise agreed by the members.  This would exclude
policyholders and employees who are
not members.
<P>

As a consequence, if certain classes of customers are to be treated as members,
it will be necessary to ensure they either become
members, or alternatively,
approval is sought from the members to authorise the participation of
non-members in the entitlement process.
<P>

<b>On what basis are they entitled to participate?</b>
<P>

The prime criteria for determining the basis of allocation of entitlements
should be, in our view:
<P>

*	demonstrably equitable;  and
<P>

*	simple for members to understand and for the NRMA Group to administer.
<P>

A <u>cumulative</u> basis of entitlement has been proposed, which effectively
rewards loyalty.
<P>

The entitlements may be based on a number of criteria, for example:
<P>

Members	*	Current member of the Association.
<P>

	*	Member for more than a predetermined period (eg. 10 or 25 years).
<P>

Policyholders	*	Current policyholder.
<P>

	*	Holding more than a predetermined number of policies (eg. 3 or 4
policies).
<P>

Employees:	*	Employee of the NRMA Group.
<P>

	*	Number of years service. 
<P>

Once the preferred structure is agreed, the legal position on who is entitled
to participate and market research would be carried
out with a view to
finalising the appropriate basis of allocation of entitlements."
<P>

283	Nothing was said about giving up membership in exchange for shares, and
there was no equivalent to the "Membership Status" material
of earlier reports.
It was said, however, when dealing with taxation issues, and referring to AAH's
earlier papers - 
<P>

"A preliminary assessment concluded that the receipt of shares, by members
would be a `gift' or `windfall' gain and would not be
assessable in the hands
of members upon receipt.  The preferred view is that a member of the
Association or Insurance has no significant
`proprietary' interest in the
Association or Insurance for capital gains tax purposes.  Accordingly, when a
member receives newly
issued shares in effective substitution for his previous
interest, the member should not be regarded as having disposed of an asset
for
capital gains tax purposes.  This opinion, however, should be made the subject
of an application for a binding private tax ruling
to remove any doubt.  The
rights of members to vote and to receive vehicle service may possibly be
regarded as assets for the purposes
of capital gains tax."
<P>

284	The report referred to risks of the preferred restructuring in the
words -
<P>

"The risks associated with changing the structure of the NRMA Group from a
mutual organisation to an organisation limited by shares
and listed on the
Australian Stock Exchange may include:
<P>

*	minority interest groups may identify the restructure as a threat to their
ability to control the NRMA Group and propose an alternative
short term
solution;
<P>

*	some members/policyholders may claim that they have not been treated
equitably in the allocation of entitlements;
<P>

*	the restructuring process invites interest from other action groups as it
highlights the lack of proprietorship of the NRMA Group's
substantial financial
resources;  and
<P>

*	in the event that the proposed restructure was to fail, the current Board of
Directors would be associated with the unsuccessful
proposal.
<P>

Possible spoiling tactics that may be used by those opposing the restructuring
proposal may include claiming that:
<P>

*	services will be diminished as a result of the restructure;
<P>

*	the NRMA Group will focus on profit making and as a result the membership
fees of the Association and the premiums of Insurance
will increase, community
programs will be abandoned and the position of many non-profit services will be
curtailed;  
<P>

*	the membership culture will change;
<P>

*	there are other ways to distribute surplus capital;  and
<P>

*	the NRMA Group has been a success to date, therefore there is no reason to
change."
<P>

285	Some observations on these aspects, in the light of what I have earlier
said, may be made.
<P>

286	First, and material to the free shares question, in general terms the
member was seen as receiving shares in exchange for his
"previous interest",
but at least for capital gains tax purposes the member's interest was not
regarded as a significant proprietary
interest.  This still left recognition
that the member had rights, in law choses in action, to vote and receive road
service, as
Mr Schultz had earlier suggested.  And although for capital gains
tax purposes the receipt of shares might be a gift or windfall
gain, members
were to pay a subscription price for their shares in HoldCo, and were then to
receive a distribution of surplus capital,
either as a dividend or as a return
of capital.  Mr Morgan's earlier letter to Ms Godwin of 1 October 1993, which I
will shortly
set out in part, had envisaged that members would subscribe for
their shares and pay the par value, and it may be that Mr Morgan
and the BT
author of the report had spoken on the subject.  That the subscription price
was "likely to be small relative to the value
of the shares" threw up the
possible problem of issue of shares at a discount, and Mr Morgan had foreseen
this in his letter.  The
nature of a members' rights was further addressed by
Mr Morgan in early November 1994.
<P>

287	Secondly, at this time the implementation of the proposal - the change in
status by members' resolutions - was left up in the
air.  The earlier
consideration of the members' resolution route and the scheme of arrangement
route did not come up, probably because
the conversion of Association and
Insurance was to be to companies limited by shares and by guarantee, not by
shares alone, and the
context of the earlier consideration no longer obtained.
The two routes came up, in a different context, in early December 1993.
<P>

288	Thirdly, entitlements was now considered in more detail, and the risk of
complaint that entitlements had not been allocated
equitably was more
specifically recognised.  As will shortly be seen, apart from the report the
NRMA had been giving more thought
to entitlements, and they were the subject of
detailed advice from Mr Morgan in early November 1994.  The advice directly
linked
entitlements and the potential for complaint of oppression.
<P>

289	Fourthly, possible disadvantages in the proposal were identified,
specifically as matters which might be alleged by those using
"spoiling
tactics".  They were diminished service, focus on profit making with consequent
increase in fees for road service and premiums,
and loss of community
programmes and non-profit services, plus general change in "membership
culture".
<P>

<b>More advisers are engaged</b>
<P>

290	The involvement of AAH in the proposal flowed from the engagement of Mr
Morgan for the Christmas Project at the end of 1992
or early in 1993.  At the
end of October 1993 Mr Gregory Bateman of Abbott Tout was brought in to
the Legal Status Project.  
<P>

291	The NRMA had been obtaining advice from and through Mr Bateman about
the requisitioning and conduct of general meetings, it
seems for reasons
unconnected with the consideration of restructuring.  A memorandum from
Ms Godwin to Mr Willing dated 27 October
1993 included, "At the
moment, Greg is unaware of the Legal Status Project.  I would like to bring him
in to it very soon because
I think he could contribute a lot, especially as far
as the question of possible structure of the Group".  Mr Willing agreed.

<P>

292	Mr Bateman was "put into the picture" (the words are taken from
another memorandum of Ms Godwin) on 4 November 1993.  Within
the NRMA
Ms Godwin proposed that AAH should "have control of the legal work for the
float process" but that AT should advise on structural
issues and possibly be
engaged for "other aspects of the project".  According to Ms Godwin's
notes of the meeting of 4 November 1993,
Mr Bateman was asked "to look at
possible structures which would be useful for company to consider.  Especially
to keep in mind how
Association activities of community advocate and community
service nature could be funded in such a structure whilst maintaining
independence of Association".
<P>

293	Also at this time the NRMA engaged Port Jackson Partners Ltd ("PJP"), in
the nature of a merchant bank.  Mr Terry Arcus of that
company acted as
adviser.  In due course Mr Ross and Mr Arcus acted in cooperation, but Mr Arcus
at times took a more leading role.
 His initial involvement, not greatly
explored in the evidence, was the production in late October 1993 of a document
summarising
in headings the comparative "risks" of the NRMA changing its
structure or doing nothing and some issues to be addressed.  What this
led to
at the time was unclear from the evidence, but the engagement of PJP, as well
as the retention of AT, indicated how seriously
the NRMA was furthering the
Legal Status Project.  
<P>

<b>	Advice on entitlements</b>
<P>

294	With the increasing activity in developing the proposal, the question of
entitlements became prominent.  It had long been recognised
as a crucial issue,
and was now addressed more fully.  It involved considering in more depth the
nature of a member's interest. 
<P>

295	With the alternative structures report, Ms Godwin and Mr Morgan spent some
time discussing the question of entitlements with
a view to recommendations for
the basis of entitlement.  In September 1993 Ms Godwin prepared an analysis of
factors according to
which entitlements could be determined (membership, former
membership, policyholder, former policyholder, length of membership or
time of
holding policy, number of policies held, number of subscriptions, total amount
paid in subscriptions, total amount paid in
premiums, employment, and many
other factors).  She asked for advice from Mr Morgan.  
<P>

296	Mr Morgan provided "draft initial views" by a letter to Ms Godwin
dated 1 October 1993.  The letter stated that Mr Morgan's
main theme was
"a concern about the fact that it may not be appropriate to recognise the
customer relationship because what we are
really doing is to change `ownership'
from being a member to that of a shareholder so that the member can realise
either now or in
the future the value of your ownership".  His views
included -
<P>

"Here existing `owners' are to be allocated the economic value of the entity.
Shares cannot be issued at a discount and, from this
point of view, the likely
approach is to offer two options to the `owners';
<P>

(a)	subscribe the par value for shares and receive a share with a market value
greater than par;
<P>

(b)	renounce right and receive cash equal to amount share sold for (its full
value).
<P>

Therefore, entitlement issues arise regarding the initial option and, secondly,
as to whom the `renounced' shares are offered. Unless
the `members' otherwise
agree, the first leg must be an offer to members - it reflects ownership in a
legal sense."
<P>

297	By a letter dated 11 October 1993 Ms Godwin asked Mr Morgan
for specific advice.  She identified the general question as "whether
membership equals ownership", and the specific questions included -
<P>

"1.	Do members of the Association and the Insurance company have any
proprietorial interest in those companies respectively?
<P>

...
<P>

5.	I assume that members' approval for basis of allocation must be obtained, is
this correct? If `yes' must that approval be of
a very specific plan or can it
be an approval `in principle'?"
<P>

Ms Godwin observed that it seemed from the paper on taxation issues that
members may have no proprietary interest, and that if this
were so it was
necessary to explore the benefits and disadvantages of making any allocation on
a wider basis.  In the memorandum
to Mr Willing of 27 October 1993
she linked that with advice on "possible means by which either NRMA Limited or
NRMA Insurance could
be attacked", and it is clear that she saw that complaint
over the basis of entitlement could be used to claim relief from oppression.
<P>

298	Mr Morgan's advice was by a lengthy letter dated 4 November 1993.  Some
importance was attached to the letter in these proceedings,
and a number of
passages should be noted.
<P>

299	Mr Morgan began by addressing the nature of the interest of a member of
Association or Insurance generally, saying that the
focus was on the type of
interest or "property" which the member held by reason of membership.  He
said -
<P>

"In our view the member's rights are actually described as a `chose in action',
a well known of [sic] form of personal property.
This form of property is the
same form of property that a person has as a party to a contract and it arises
essentially by reason
of the fact that by becoming a member the member thereby
becomes contractually bound to the company and to other members in accordance
with the contract set forth in Section 180 of the Corporations Law. The member
has a bundle of rights under this contract. The member
also has obligations
under the contract. Under the Corporations Law the member also has other rights
and obligations. However, these
rights and obligations arise from statute and
are not strictly part of the property of the member.
<P>

Membership of a company limited by guarantee may be compared to a shareholding
of a company limited by shares. The Courts have found
it extraordinarily
difficult to define the legal nature of shares despite their familiarity and
the Courts have usually described
shares as a `chose in action' or as a `bundle
of rights'. A share is not a form of tangible property but, because a share is
usually
transferable [sic], is it loosely described as `property' in a more
general sense so as to equate it with other types of tangible
or transferable
property. In reality the type of property held by a member of a company limited
by guarantee is essentially the same
as the type of property held by a
shareholder in a company limited by shares. The real difference between the two
arrangements is
in the rights and obligations that attach to them."
<P>

300	So Mr Morgan answered the first question asked by Ms Godwin on 11
October 1993 in the terms, "that members of both the Association
and Insurance
have a form of personal property arising from the contract constituted by the
Memorandum and Articles of Association
of both companies".
<P>

301	Mr Morgan then went to the rights and obligations of a member.  He
began -
<P>

"The members' rights are essentially the right to vote and the principal
obligation is to contribute on winding up and to pay membership
fees and
charges. However, in critical matters, some members have different rights or no
rights at all. The power to vary these rights
by members is also a critical
issue for consideration."
<P>

In connection with variation of the rights, he adverted to s 260 of the
Law "which prohibits oppressive conduct, this protects a
member against the
companies' affairs being conducted oppressively, unjustly or in a
discriminatory way and similarly protects class
rights";  he adverted also to
s 167 of the Law.  
<P>

302	After a brief description of the Christmas Project (as he still called it)
structure as one likely to involve the use of a holding
company issuing shares,
Mr Morgan continued -
<P>

"<b>The Windfall</b>
<P>

The position of Project Christmas does not easily fit into any of the normal
situations.  It is an issue but it is also a `sale'
in a sense.  This is
because the essence of the offering is not a capital raising but rather the
transfer of economic ownership to
shareholders.
<P>

However, shares may not be issued at a discount and for a number of reasons,
including tax and doubt as to whether the members have
anything in the nature
of transferable property to sell, it is proposed that each member `transfer'
(or more properly give up) their
existing rights for shares.
<P>

Shares will be issued at par, say $1.00.  Those entitled may take them up or
renounce the right and receive the cash consideration
received on disposition
of the renounced shares.  Once issued, the shares would be worth considerably
more than $1.00 and this difference
is the `windfall' or equivalence of the
economic interest in the NRMA Group.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>Is passing part of the Windfall to non-members valid?</b>
<P>

If we assume the requisite majority of members and each relevant class approves
a proposal to issue shares on a windfall basis to
non-members being
policyholders, can dissenting members complain and what is the likelihood of
success?
<P>

Secondly, could Association members complain if shares are issued on a windfall
basis to members of Insurance by reference to their
membership of Insurance or
to persons who are not members of Association.  This could arise, for example,
where the number of shares
reflected membership of Insurance in some way (eg
premiums paid).
<P>

In essence, the grounds of complaint would be either:
<P>

(a)	a fraud on the minority;  or
<P>

(b)	oppression either at general law or under section 260 of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

The argument would be that the majority of members or directors in so acting
either misused their power to the detriment of the
minority or acted
oppressively or in a manner that was unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly
discriminatory against, a member or class
of members or contrary to the
interests of members as a whole.
<P>

If the action involves a fraud on the minority in accordance with the common
law principles, it is more than likely that action
would also be available
under Section 260 of the Corporations Law.  That section has a number of
advantages for a member pursuing
the matter, being procedural advantages and
advantages in the scope of the orders that a Court may be able to make in the
event that
the conduct is found to fall within that section.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>Likely legal consequences of allocating, or attempting to allocate, shares
to non-members</b>
<P>

We conclude that there is a danger that, if, as part of the process, shares are
allocated to non-members (that is policyholders)
on the basis that those
members become entitled to the windfall, persons who are members may well have
a claim against the companies
on the basis of there being a fraud on the
minority or, alternatively, a breach of Section 260 of the Corporations Law.
The risk
of this is far less if the non-members to whom this right is extended
come within a class of policyholder who would have been a member
but for
matters of inadvertence, error or like matter.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>Is members' approval for the allocation required and is that approval
required specifically or can it be obtained in principle?</b>
<P>

The answer to this question depends in part as to exactly what structure is
adopted and how the process of approval is carried out.
However, regardless of
the structure, it appears to us inevitable that the background to the detailed
resolutions required to effect
a change of status of Association and of
Insurance or the acquisition of shares by a Holding Company and the issue of
shares by that
Holding Company will require detailed explanation to members as
to the basis on which the shares will be issued and the way in which
they will
be allocated. As we have noted, the actual allocation of shares is normally a
matter for Directors or Owners but the situation
here is different from the
norm. We do not believe that members will approve the proposal unless the
Directors' proposals in respect
of this matter are made clear at any relevant
meeting and, unless that is done fully and frankly, members may truly have a
basis
for a legal remedy under Section 260.
<P>

<b>The Risk Considerations</b>
<P>

One of the real concerns of extending the windfall to non-members is the
opportunities it provides for `spoilers'.  If an action
is commenced under
Section 260 that cannot be quickly disposed of or about which we have a high
level of confidence that it will
not be successful, it has the real likelihood
of catastrophically upsetting the issue and listing process."  
<P>

303	Mr Morgan did not in terms answer the second question asked by Ms Godwin on
11 October 1993, but clearly conveyed a yes and
that there had to be a specific
plan.  In doing so, however, he acted on the notion of giving up membership
rights for shares, at
least in relation to the windfall element of the shares
and even though there was payment of par value for the shares, and
(consistently
with the paper on taxation issues) described the membership
rights as essentially the right to vote.  He made plain that complaint
over
entitlements could be used to claim relief from oppression, even as a
"spoiling" claim.  The postulated complaint was not only
of giving entitlements
to non-members, but of giving entitlements to members of Insurance of which
members of Association might complain,
and other complaints of unfairness
between members would readily have been envisaged.  Further, Mr Morgan noted as
relevant to oppression
that full and frank disclosure of the proposal was
required.
<P>

304	Ms Godwin sent a copy of Mr Morgan's letter of 4 November 1993 to
Mr Bateman.  Her concern at the time seems to have been Mr
Morgan's
suggestion that the directors of Insurance might have been a class of members.
Ms Godwin said that if the board of Insurance
remained as it was "there is
likely to be 25% of the Board voting against proposals connected with this
project", and that if a director
in favour retired "the proposals would be in
jeopardy".  She had already asked Mr Bateman to obtain the opinion of senior
counsel
on "class rights issues", specifically whether Association was a class
of member in Insurance, and she said the position of the directors
of Insurance
should be included.  Mr Bateman briefed Mr David Bennett QC in early
December 1993.  Later in the month Mr Bennett provided
an advice that the
directors were not a class of members, although he said that it was remotely
arguable that they were and for more
abundant caution their consent should be
obtained.
<P>

305	By a letter to Ms Godwin dated 9 November 1993 Mr Morgan provided a
summary of his advice as to entitlements, so far as relevant
being -
<P>

"1.	The members of both Association and Insurance hold a form of personal
property in the relevant company the rights and interests
(and, of course, the
obligations) arising from the terms of the contract between each other and with
the company constituted by the
Memorandum and Articles of Association.  The
members also have, in their capacity as members, common law rights and rights
under
statute to protect their interest.  The principal rights are those to
take action in the event of fraud on the minority or in the
event of
oppression.
<P>

2.	A policyholder of Insurance who is not a member of Association or Insurance
has no such rights or interest.
<P>

3.	In order to effect an allocation of shares to non-members and to make the
offer contemplated by Project Christmas, the Memorandum
and Articles of
Association of both Association and Insurance need to be changed and these
changes will of necessity change the rights
of members.  Project Christmas
involves a transfer of economic ownership and therefore, a windfall to those
who are granted `entitlements'.
The entitlements can be taken in the form of a
share or cash if the share right is renounced.  This raises two questions:
<P>

(a)	whether or not different classes of members exist and whether particular
consent is required from those classes if the amendments
particularly affect
them;  and
<P>

(b)	whether dissentient members may have a cause of action if the windfall is
passed to non-members.
<P>

...
<P>

	On the second question we conclude that, if the windfall is passed to
non-members, that [sic] dissentient members may have a right
of action for
fraud on the minority or for oppression under Section 260 of the Corporations
Law......
<P>

5.	Although allocation is essentially a matter for Directors, in our view, to
obtain approval for the Project, the proposed methods
of allocation will need
to be explained in detail in order to obtain a relatively informed consent."
<P>

<b>Project organisation</b>
<P>

306	On 9 November 1993 BT provided a draft timetable for the restructuring,
according to which the proposal would go to the members
of the NRMA in the
first week of July 1994 and would conclude with listing in the second week of
October 1994.  The establishment
of working groups in the first week of March
1994, with particular responsibilities for offer structure, prospectus/due
diligence,
and logistics, was suggested.  Steps were put in train to "clean up"
the data base from which membership of Association and Insurance
was taken and
to enable various factors for entitlements to be ascertained.  Within the NRMA
Mr  Rees was detailed to head the project,
and The Rowland Company Pty
Limited ("Rowland") was engaged to advise on public relations and advertising
matters.  The market research
group often used by the NRMA, Woolcott Research
Pty Limited ("Woolcott"), was brought into the project a little later.
Confidentiality
agreements were prepared, and presumably entered into as
necessary.
<P>

307	A meeting was held on 25 November 1993, attended by NRMA management and
representatives of BT, PJP, and Rowland, at which there
were discussed various
strategic and operational issues, including a project management structure,
communications, the roles of the
outside advisers, the resources to be brought
in by the NRMA, and a timetable and budget.  Mr Rees recommended a
steering committee
comprising Mr Willing and himself, with a project
management organisation under his direction.  In fact the steering committee
was
informal at best, and the project management organisation changed as the
project continued.
<P>

308	An all day "strategic planning conference" was held on 1 December
1993, attended by Mr King, Mr Rees, Ms Conway, Mrs Graham,
Ms Godwin, Mr Arcus, and Mr Philip Stern also of PJP.  It had been
preceded by meetings on 26 and 29 November 1993, at which had
been variously
present Mr Willing, Mr Ross, Mr Barrett of Rowland, and others
additional to those present on 1 December 1993.  The
meetings had been
concerned amongst other things with a detailed timetable from taking the
proposal to the boards in the first week
of February 1994 to listing in October
1994;  with entitlements (the need for a recommended basis of entitlement by
the time of the
board meetings and board decisions at the March meeting);  and
with alternative  structures.  
<P>

309	It seems that PJP's contribution was now being received, and PJP prepared
discussion topics for the strategic planning conference
calling for a<i>
</i>"recap of thinking" in connection with entitlements and the new structure
and setting out considerations material to each (the absence
of anyone from BT
at the meeting may have been intentional).  The discussion at the meeting, of
which there was not detailed evidence,
seems to have brought a number of
questions for Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman.  
<P>

310	At a meeting on 2 December 1993, at which Mr Rees,
Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman were
present, Mr Morgan and
Mr Bateman were brought up to date on the project (the
wording reflects that of Ms Godwin's file note).  Amongst other things,
there
was discussion of the project management organisation and of the roles
Messrs Morgan and Bateman were to play.  In general, Mr Morgan
was to
deal with the prospectus and most of the legal matters, Mr Bateman with
specific matters.  The immediate attention was to
be to the issue of
entitlements.  A matter particularly mentioned, as recorded in
Mr Bateman's note of the meeting, was "Spoiling
tactics are the issue eg,
injunction, proceedings on foot", and Mr Bateman was asked by Ms Conway to
"think through what spoiling
tactics might be adopted by those opposed to the
proposal so that we can understand what they may be, how they should be
counteracted
and dealt with".  
<P>

311	To follow through this request, Mr Bateman responded to it at a meeting
with Ms Conway, Mr Barrett, and Mr Ian Cropper also
of Rowland on 3 December
1993.  It is unnecessary to go in detail into what was said.  The tactics
forecast by Mr Bateman included
allegations that the directors were misleading
the members in their notices of meeting, and the bringing of court proceedings,
the
court proceedings being founded on allegations of oppression, of misleading
the members, and of breach of duty on the part of directors.
 Mr Bateman
explained that oppression was "a wide-sweeping concept", not always capable of
precise definition but essentially when
actions were taken by a majority to act
in their interests at the expense of the minority of shareholders;  he said
that going to
court arguing for oppression would be "a key weapon", because the
very fact of the proceedings would generate publicity, suspicion,
and concern.
He referred specifically to a spoiling tactic of bringing court proceedings
upon the publication of the notice of meeting
and its explanatory memorandum,
alleging that the documents were misleading, and explained that what was
required was that the documents
fully and fairly inform the members of
everything material to their decision in relation to the matter, of all they
needed to know
to understand the issues to be voted on.
<P>

312	There developed as part of the project management organisation regular
meetings known as communications meetings, attended by
many of those concerned
with the project and intended to ensure that those concerned with one aspect of
it knew what was happening
in the other aspects.  The first meeting of this
kind, although at the time more of a general planning meeting, was held also on
3 December 1993.  It was attended by Mr King, Mr Rees, Mr Ron
Burnstein (general manager, community and customer relations), Mr Pearce,
Ms Melanie O'Connor (general manager, human resources), Ms Conway,
Ms Godwin, Mr Ross, Mr Barry, Mr Stern, Mr Barrett,
Mr Morgan,
and Mr Bateman.  Ms Godwin's notes of the meeting recorded
a tentative programme for presentation of the proposal to the Board of
Management of Association and the board of Insurance on the first Thursday in
February, and to the board of Association two weeks
later, and 6 December 1993
was appointed for the next meeting with a programme of communications meetings
thereafter.
<P>

<b>The question of scheme or meeting</b>
<P>

313	Prominent in this period was further attention to entitlements,
particularly with an eye to the "spoiling" to which Mr Morgan
had referred
in his advice of 4 November 1993.  
<P>

314	In a letter to Ms Godwin dated 17 November 1993, Mr Morgan
recorded a request to consider steps open to persons seeking to obtain
control
of the NRMA and what difficulties and hurdles that person might face.  Although
at first sight not entirely responsively
to the request, Mr Morgan said
that "In the context of Project Christmas"<i> </i>it was necessary to consider
potential action that might be taken by a person seeking to gain control of the
NRMA or "actions that
may be taken by persons seeking to "spoil" proposals
supported by the Board or by the members in general meeting".<i>  </i>As to
spoiling, Mr Morgan's observations included, "The defensive opportunities
for the Board in an attack upon Association are relatively
limited although a
dissentient group of members may perhaps be able to bring an action alleging
fraud on the minority or oppression
if they could demonstrate that in some way
they were adversely affected and that the proposal was not able to be justified
as in
the best interest of the company as a whole". 
<P>

315	A basis of entitlement was set out in a memorandum from Mrs Graham and
Mr Peter Worland (assistant general manager, external
relations) to
Mr Rees dated 19 November 1993.  The basis was simple, perhaps simplistic,
and was that "any entitlement be offered
to all members of NRMA Limited in
equal shares".  The basis later adopted was more sophisticated.  The notion of
oppression must
have gained currency, because the reasons for the suggested
basis included, under the heading "Oppression Suit" -
<P>

<b>	</b>"The greatest risk of failure is that a body of opinion develops which
opposes the float and the vote is lost.  The second greatest
risk of failure is
that someone decides to bring an action alleging oppression or fraud on the
minority which, regardless of the
ultimate outcome of the case, would be
sufficient to effectively extinguish any chance of success".
<P>

316	A meeting was held on the morning of 6 December 1993, attended by
Mr Rees, Mr King, Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, Mr Ross,
Mr Barry,
Mr Arcus, Mr Stern, Mr Morgan, and
Mr Bateman.  It examined a structure involving a holding company with
Association, Insurance,
and other NRMA companies as subsidiaries, and the
attention seems to have been on providing for a "Foundation"<i> </i> as the
vehicle for the NRMA's advocacy and community services.  
<P>

317	In the climate of attention to entitlements and spoiling, oppression must
have been in the minds of those present.  There was
consideration of removing
the voting rights of members of Association while leaving them as members, and
according to the record
of the meeting the objections to that course included
that there might be an oppression action and/or an action under section 260
of
the Law.  
<P>

318	The question of scheme or meeting now specifically arose.  The record of
the meeting at a later point read -
<P>

"<b>1.13	Scheme or Meeting</b>
<P>

Under the proposal we would be extinguishing the rights of members in
Association and Insurance, albeit in return for other benefits,
namely, shares
in a holding company and/or a cash benefit.
<P>

It is possible that of the 1.8 million (approximate) members of Association
only a fairly small proportion will vote. Assume, for
example, that 200,000
members vote on the proposal. If 75% of those 200,000 voting are in favour this
will mean that 150,000 members
of the Association have determined the future of
the organisation. A possible way of dealing with this issue is to have the
proposal
embodied as a scheme of arrangement which is then approved by court.
The difficulty with that is that opponents of the proposal have
the right then
to attack the proposal in court. This provides a very public and formal forum
for opposition.
<P>

It was suggested that the determination of the acceptance or rejection of the
proposal by a vote at a meeting is no different from
the compulsory acquisition
of a minority holding (other than the size of that holding).
<P>

A scheme forces us to go to court and virtually seeks opposition to the
proposal. (This is not to suggest that there would be no
opposition if the
proposal were to be dealt with by way of voting at a meeting but it is far less
attractive for an opponent to actively
bring a case against those putting
forward the proposal than to respond to an action which has already been
initiated in court by
those proposing.)
<P>

Benefits of embarking on a scheme approach are the:-
<P>

*	openness of handling the matter in this way
<P>

*	the guaranteed success of the proposal if the scheme is approved
<P>

*	a formal forum for airing the proposal
<P>

against which must be offset the problem of giving a very attractive forum to
one's opposition.
<P>

<b>Benefits of a vote/meeting</b>
<P>

*	Openness of proposal
<P>

*	Democracy at work
<P>

*	Less attractive forum for opponents
<P>

JM to obtain Sydney Council's [sic] advice
<P>

by 31 December, 1993."
<P>

319	On the NRMA's case, this question of scheme or meeting provided the first
and principal occasion for advice of risk to the proposal
from the appeal to
the High court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  It is important to see how the
question arose.  There were differing recollections.
<P>

320	Mr Morgan had earlier advised to the effect that the status of the mutual
companies could be changed to that of companies limited
by shares and by
guarantee under s 167 of the Law, that is, by resolutions in general
meeting, but that oppression would have to
be avoided.  Only if there was to be
a change in status to that of companies limited by shares alone did Mr Morgan
see a difficulty,
and he had also said that there was doubt whether the
difficulty could be overcome by a scheme of arrangement - hence the request
for
legislative change to s 167.  Although the proposed restructuring was not
settled in detail, it seems to have been regarded as
acceptable that
Association and Insurance should become companies limited by shares and by
guarantee.  For Mr Morgan, therefore,
there was no occasion to go to a scheme
of arrangement, and no point in doing so.
<P>

321	According to Mr Morgan, at the meeting of 3 December 1993 someone, probably
Mr Ross, asked whether it was necessary to have
a scheme of arrangement in
order to implement the proposal, and he (Mr Morgan) replied that it could be
done by having the members
agree to amendments to the memoranda and articles of
the companies.  In his witness statement dated 28 April 1997 Mr Morgan said
that Mr Bateman expressed agreement, and that at the meeting of 6 December 1993
there was a similar exchange and agreement.  Mr Morgan
gave evidence of his
consideration of the matter and his reasoning.  In short, he considered that
there was power in accordance with
the articles of Association and Insurance
and the provisions of the Law to amend the articles to provide for
extinguishment of membership
in a way binding on all members, provided that
there was no oppression either under common law principles or within s 260 of
the
Law:  hence Mr Morgan was concerned that the entitlements should be
determined in a manner which was fair.  Mr Morgan said that he
took into
account the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, which he
thought stood for the proposition that the cessation of membership rights could
be effected so long as any unfairness of
a type which could justify complaint
of oppression was avoided.  
<P>

322	According to Mr Bateman, however, he did not agree at the meetings with Mr
Morgan's reply to the enquiry, but said that he thought
a scheme of arrangement
was necessary in order to "force out everybody from membership of Association
and Insurance".  His reasoning,
reflected in the extract from the record of the
meeting set out above, was that if only a small proportion of members voted (as
historically
had been the case at annual general meetings) a minority of
members could deprive the majority of their membership, and he felt that
might
take the matter out of the normal situation of effective resolutions.  
<P>

323	According to Mr Bateman, when he voiced his doubt Mr Morgan replied that<i>
Gambotto's case</i> said that shareholders could vote to adopt new articles
with compulsory acquisition provisions, thereby forcing out dissenting members.
That Mr Morgan said something to this effect is supported by the part of the
extract from the record of the meeting referring to
the compulsory acquisition
of a minority holding.  Mr Bateman maintained his doubt and his opinion that a
scheme of arrangement was
necessary;  Mr Morgan said that a scheme of
arrangement was undesirable because it provided a platform for opponents of the
proposal;
 Mr Bateman said he was unhappy with that approach and "I really
think this should be looked at";  and Ms Conway said that Mr Morgan
would have
to "advise on how members' rights are crunched out" and that a QC's opinion
might be necessary.  Still according to Mr
Bateman, there was a brief return to
the subject later in the meeting, when Mr Bateman said, "If only 120,000 people
vote for the
new articles and 75% are in favour, that is 90,000 can we impose
the results on the entire 1.8 million members?  It just seems wrong,
and I
think we need a scheme to be able to implement that."  Mr Rees then reiterated
that Mr Morgan would be determining whether
to proceed by members' resolution
or scheme of arrangement.  
<P>

324	Others present at the meeting were either not asked for their recollections
or had no significant recollections on this matter.
 Mr Bateman's recollection
is broadly supported by the extract from the record of the meeting, in
particular in his denial that he
agreed with Mr Morgan's opinion that members'
resolutions were sufficient:  it is unlikely that the record would have said
what it
did had there not been an exchange of the kind of which Mr Bateman gave
evidence.  Further, in his witness statement dated 8 August
1997, responding to
the witness statement in which Mr Bateman set out his recollection, although Mr
Morgan said he did not recollect
much of what Mr Bateman had set out he
acknowledged that on 3 December 1993 Mr Bateman had expressed the view that a
scheme of arrangement
would be necessary (but he also said that Mr Bateman
added that it might be possible to "do it" by way of members' resolution). 
As
well, Mr Morgan said that he recalled Mr Bateman querying on 6 December 1993
whether the result could be imposed on all members
if only a particular number
voted for the new articles and 75 per cent of them were in favour.  Mr
Bateman's recollection is also
broadly supported by Mr Rees, and by Ms Conway
save as to the expression "crunch out members rights".  On any view, the
question
of scheme or meeting was raised, and I consider that it arose and was
dealt with in the manner recounted by Mr Bateman.  
<P>

325	That included reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i>, which was clearly
mentioned as a relevant case.  Its relevance in the then context was in
connection with compulsory extinguishment
of membership, on one view a kind of
expropriation no different from compulsory acquisition of a minority
shareholding.  There was
a fairly obvious preference for avoiding a scheme of
arrangement if that route was not necessary.  Despite the background of
entitlements
and oppression to which I have referred, the advice which Mr
Morgan was instructed to obtain amounted to advice as to whether the
fact of
something like expropriation might make the exercise of the power to amend the
articles invalid, not as to whether the basis
of entitlement (which was still
unresolved) or any other matter provided grounds for a claim of invalidating
oppression.  
<P>

326	On the afternoon of 6 December 1993 there was a further meeting directed to
legal issues, attended by Ms Conway, Ms Godwin,
Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman.  The
record of the meeting noted a great many matters for attention and the person
or persons responsible.
 It included, under the heading "Scheme or Meeting?",
that Mr Morgan was to "prepare brief and obtain Senior Counsel's opinion on
the
issue of whether the organisation would be obliged to deal with any proposal
relating to structure by way of a scheme or whether
this could be done by
meeting".  Mr Bateman's note of the meeting included, clearly referable to this
item, that "Mr Morgan will
prepare opinion on whether scheme is required or
whether res of members to crunch out members is sufficient".  
<P>

<b>Some other elements in the proposal</b>
<P>

327	The morning meeting on 6 December 1993 also considered the basis of
entitlement, and valuation material to entitlements, and
according to the
record of the meeting the issue "How will people get their entitlement and what
will they get".  It was asked who
was entitled, how the net worth of the
organisation was to be divided, and how the groups entitled were to divide
their portions,
and there was discussion of how Association's "rights in
Insurance" might be valued.  
<P>

328	As to how people would get their entitlements, the record of the meeting
included -
<P>

"2.5	Is there a way to subscribe for shares without the requirement for a
payment to be made by the person subscribing?
<P>

It is possible although messy and difficult.  One suggestion was the issue of
bonus shares by Insurance after it had converted to
a company limited by shares
and guarantee and that there would be some conversion of shares between the
holding company and Insurance.
<P>

However on analysis there would be no difference in the allocation results if
such a method were used and there was no intrinsic
benefit in doing so (apart
from the avoidance of the need to front with cash for the shares)."
<P>

329	There was later reference under the heading "Mechanics" to cash alone, to a
choice of shares or cash with members having "to
find cash to pay the par value
of the shares", to shares with what was called a savings plan, and to
allocation of shares not taken
up by members in the first instance.  
<P>

330	Later again the record included -
<P>

"3.3  Do people who are buying shares actually have to hand over cash?  There
needs to be payment of the par value (tax advice previously
given on this point
and will be confirmed) and any other way is extremely difficult.  Reasons for
these difficulties should be noted
by JM.
<P>

JM
<P>

There is the question of financial assistance should the Group pay for the
shares on the basis that it sets aside the money pre-float
to which members are
said to be entitled and which is then held "in trust" (very loose terminology)
and that money is then used to
pay for shares which members take up. 
<P>

JM to advise and obtain Counsel's 
<P>

advice on issue of financial assistance
<P>

Par Value of Shares?
<P>

We need a recommendation on capitalisation of structure, market value of shares
and par value of shares and related matters.  This
issue raised by the question
of how much would we be asking a member to pay?  If for example shares had a
par value of $1 this could
be prohibitively high for members to take up the
shares.
<P>

BT"
<P>

331<i>	</i>There can be seen development of the previous thinking, perhaps
rather unclear thinking, that members wishing to take shares in the
holding
company rather than cash would subscribe for the shares and pay par value.  It
was questioned whether actual payment was
necessary, although at the time it
was thought it was difficult to avoid the necessity, and Mr Morgan was to
advise on the difficulties
of any other course.  It seems that one other course
was raised, some kind of trust of NRMA money to be used to pay for the shares,
and that a problem of the NRMA providing unlawful financial assistance was
foreseen.  Mr Morgan was to brief counsel.  It is evident
that at this time
members were still seen as paying cash for the shares in some way.  The
relationship between the par value and
the market value of the shares was
raised, and although not specifically noted in the record would have thrown up
its own problems.
 The development of the thinking was in its early stages, and
not entirely precise.
<P>

332	And the matter of spoiling continued to receive attention.  Apart from the
reference at the morning meeting on 6 December 1993
to oppression in connection
with removing the voting rights of members of Association while leaving them as
members, the record of
the afternoon meeting on the day included a note to the
effect that Mr Bateman was to advise on "Legal Spoiling and Tactics".
Mr
Bateman's note of that matter was "Spoiling tactics/war games".  The
reference to war games was to a suggestion by Mr Barrett that
there should be
an exercise, described as a war gaming session, at which two "teams" would
present cases for and against the restructuring.
 The case for the
restructuring would assist Rowland to devise easily understood and appealing
messages to sway the emotions of members
in favour of the proposal.  The case
against restructuring would expose what opponents of the restructuring might do
and the arguments
or appeals to emotion they might use.  The war gaming session
was conducted on 14 December 1993.
<P>

333	Following the afternoon meeting on 6 December 1993 each of Mr Morgan
and Mr Bateman provided Ms Godwin with a list of legal
issues.  
<P>

334	Mr Morgan's list identified "the areas in which I believe you will require
advice from us", and the first two items were "the
entitlements proposal and
legal risks associated with it"<i> </i>and "whether a scheme of arrangement is
necessary"; other issues were broad, including the steps required for
restructuring and "identification
at this stage at a relatively high level of
matters which will need to be dealt with in the proposal to members and offer
documents
including initial drafting of our client prospectus".  
<P>

335	Mr Bateman's list was more detailed and addressed more particular
matters, and seems to have been a list of legal issues generally
rather than
those falling to AT.  It included "Can a resolution of members of each of
Association and Insurance resolve to adopt
new Articles or other procedures
which will effectively cause every member, bar Holdings, to cease to be a
member from the Changeover
Date.  Alternatively, will a scheme of arrangement
be required".  It also had a number of matters to do with arriving at
entitlements,
and under the heading "Litigation" included "Who will<i>
</i>defend court challenges based on:  (a) oppression; (b) breach of directors
duties; (c) misleading information in material sent to
members; (d) refusal of
access to information".  
<P>

336	Neither Mr Morgan's list nor Mr Bateman's list specifically identified how
members would get their entitlements as a legal issue.
 Ms Godwin provided her
own list of legal issues to Ms Conway.  It included "tax issues connected with
paying dividend", "nature
of entity used if no cash to be paid by company", and
"financial assistance question if we try to avoid requirement that our members
have to pay `up front' for shares" - an eclectic collection demonstrating the
uncertainty at this time.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed on scheme or meeting</b>
<P>

337	The question of scheme or meeting came up at another meeting on legal
issues on 9 December, attended by Ms Godwin, Mr Morgan,
Mr David
Simpson, and Mr Bateman.  Mr Simpson was a solicitor at AAH working
with Mr Morgan on the Legal Status Project;  he became
a partner of AAH on
1 July 1994.  
<P>

338	The discussion at the meeting included what Ms Godwin's record of the
meeting described as "Analysis of whether a meeting or
scheme needed to carry
out any proposed restructure", and that Mr Morgan would prepare a brief
for Mr Heydon "for Monday, 13 December"
to obtain an oral opinion.
Ms Godwin's record later said, under the heading "Entitlement" -
<P>

"Following the initial conference on this matter which [sic] Heydon QC it
is proposed that there be a conference with him at which
Ray is present.  It is
intended that we have a very strong indicative view on this issue no later than
17 December". 
<P>

The oral evidence did not clarify this.  Mr Simpson's notes of the meeting
had "Entitlements issues" followed by an arrow pointing
to "get counsel
sign-off", the names of Mr Heydon and Mr Willing, and another arrow
to the words "place this material in brief".
 The oral evidence did not clarify
this either.
<P>

339	According to Mr Bateman, in the course of the discussion Mr Morgan made a
reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i> which he could not recall, and he (Mr
Bateman) said -
<P>

"I just think you need a scheme to do the proposal.  First, you need legal
certainty if you are going to take away 1.8 million memberships,
particularly
where only a small number of people will vote.  Second, the proposal will
involve giving benefits to policy holders,
as opposed to members.  Third, you
are also going to force membership of the new Foundation on people."
<P>

Ms Godwin said, "We understand your view, let's just wait to see what Heydon
says".  
<P>

340	Mr Morgan did not recall Mr Bateman saying any of these things.  Mr Simpson
gave evidence that at no time did Mr Bateman say
what appears in the first two
sentences, and that he did not recall Mr Bateman ever saying what appears in
the third sentence.  More
generally, according to Mr Simpson Mr Bateman did not
ever say anything to the effect that the proposal could not be implemented
by
resolutions of members alone.  Mr Simpson's recollection was that he, and in
his belief Mr Morgan, were of the tentative view
that the proposal could be
implemented by resolutions of members, but that the matter needed research, and
that it was possible that
Mr Morgan said as much.  
<P>

341	It is clear enough, from the record of the meeting and Mr Simpson's notes
and from the letter and brief next mentioned, that
a connection was perceived
between entitlements and whether a scheme of arrangement was necessary.  This
was an extension of the
contention over scheme or meeting on 3 and 6 December
1993, because it introduced as a matter material to proceeding by members'
resolutions what members, and perhaps others, would get in lieu of their
memberships.  It was but a short step to whether the fairness
of the basis of
entitlement impacted on proceeding by members' resolutions, and the step was
taken in the brief to Mr Heydon.  But
the original contention remained.  Mr
Bateman's recollection of the meeting of 9 December 1993 is consistent with
what I have accepted
occurred on 3 and 6 December 1993, and broadly supported
by the objective material, and I accept it.  
<P>

342	Mr Morgan telephoned Mr Heydon, and told him that the NRMA was "thinking of
restructuring" and that he expected "a number of
specific legal questions to
arise in the coming months on which we would wish to seek your advice".  He
asked whether Mr Heydon was
reasonably available, and Mr Heydon said that he
was.  Mr Morgan said that there was one brief to be considered in the very near
future, that an urgent written opinion was needed, and that he would like to
explain it in conference before Mr Heydon advised in
writing.  Mr Heydon said
he would try, but pointed out that he was in a current court case and that his
last working day would be
20 December 1993.  A conference was fixed for 14
December 1993.
<P>

343	On 10 December 1993 Mr Morgan wrote to Mr Heydon confirming the
conference for 14 December 1993 and, in advance of the formal
brief, providing
some background information and describing "the main questions we are asking".

<P>

344	Mr Morgan said that the final proposal had not been determined, but that in
broad terms the proposal being examined was "that
members would be given an
entitlement to subscribe for shares in the holding company at par with an
option to renounce that right",
with the renounced shares then being sold to
institutions and the net proceeds distributed to the members who had renounced
their
rights.  He said that the members who had subscribed for shares would
receive shares much higher in value than the subscription monies
they had paid.
The letter continued -
<P>

"One of the most significant matters causing concern is the manner in which the
entitlement to shares is distributed between the
members of the Association and
the members of Insurance and the extent to which any benefits may be provided
to policyholders of
Insurance who are not members.  We have set out our views
in relation to class rights and entitlement issues in our letter of 4 November
1993, a copy of which is attached.
<P>

The immediate question which we have for you focuses upon the amendments which
will need to be approved in general meeting to the
Memorandum and Articles of
Association of Association and Insurance.  Those amendments, when given effect
to, will remove the existing
members as members of those companies on the basis
that those members are given an allocation of shares in the new holding
company.
<P>

It has been suggested that, if this was approached by way of a scheme of
arrangement and the scheme was approved by the Court, then
certainty would be
achieved as to the binding effect of the resolution of members upon all
members.  We, however, believe that a
scheme of arrangement carries with it
significant risks and, in particular, provides a greater opportunity for
opponents to the proposal
to express their views and to have them heard in the
forum of the Court.
<P>

We also believe that, on the basis of current authority, if the members duly
approve the reconstruction of the companies and the
shares in the holding
company are duly issued in accordance with that reconstruction proposal, that
that is of itself sufficient
to bind the members.  Of course, members may seek
to bring action on the basis that there is a fraud upon the minority or that
there
is an oppression but we believe that, so long as the allocation of
entitlements is fair, the likelihood of the success of such action
is extremely
low.  You should note that based on past experience the voters turnout at the
meeting to approve the proposal may be
quite low.  In the past, voter turnout
has been about 5% of Association members and less than 1% of Insurance
members.
<P>

The question we therefore ask you to consider is whether a scheme is necessary
to achieve the ends sought.
<P>

For the purposes of considering this narrow question as to whether or not a
member's resolution approving the proposal will effectively
bind members, you
should assume that the allocation adopted will meet the requirements of
fairness as between members.
<P>

The only particular group of members who will be treated differently will be
those persons who become members after the date of
the announcement of the
proposal.  The current proposal would involve a closing of the books of each
company at the date of announcement
with a clear statement then being made to
any person who became a new member thereafter that their membership would not
entitle them
to participate in the share issue by the holding company and that
the membership would terminate on the reconstruction being approved.
<P>

There are some other matters which we would like you to examine and, in
particular, we would be looking to you for any comment you
might have in
relation to our analysis of the entitlements issue.  We will deal with these
more fully in our formal brief and in
the conference".
<P>

345	A draft brief to Mr Heydon was prepared by Mr Simpson, at the request of Mr
Morgan and to deal with issues identified by Mr
Morgan.  Mr Simpson had a note
of a discussion with Morgan on 9 December 1993, which included "scheme of
arrangement/necessary? 
Gambotto - Meagher J and fairness", and his research
for the brief included reading the decisions of McLelland J and the Court of
Appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  As will be seen, <i>Gambotto's case</i> was
referred to at some length in the brief, although it will be necessary to
consider in what connection.  
<P>

346	According to Mr Simpson, he formed the view that <i>Gambotto's case</i>,
and in particular the judgment of Meagher JA, stood for the proposition that if
the compensation for expropriation was fair and
benefits flowed to the company
from the expropriation, then it was possible to expropriate proprietary rights
of minority shareholders
in a company pursuant to majority shareholder
resolution, although what was fair compensation depended upon the particular
proposal.
 He thought that this was consistent with other English and
Australian cases to which he had recourse.  So he thought that a scheme
of
arrangement was not necessary in order to implement a proposal whereby
membership rights in Association and Insurance were extinguished
in exchange
for shares in a holding company, and that the proposal could be implemented
through members' resolutions if it could

<P>

be said that no classes of members of Association and Insurance were being
treated unfairly or oppressively.  In his witness statement
Mr Simpson said
that he may have asked a solicitor at AAH to look into any progress of
<i>Gambotto's case</i> after the decision of the Court of Appeal, but in his
oral evidence he said that this was not based on recollection but on
speculation.
<P>

247	The draft brief was provided to Mr Morgan, who approved it.  It was
provided to Ms Godwin and Mr Bateman for their comments,
and was amended to
take account of the comments.  The brief in its final form was delivered to
Mr Heydon on the afternoon of 13 December
1993, the covering letter
confirming the conference appointed for 7.30am on the next day.
<P>

348	The brief began by describing the NRMA's existing structure and membership,
and then said - 
<P>

<b>"2.	Proposed Structure</b>
<P>

At this stage the structure of the proposed flotation being considered is
somewhat fluid although Counsel can assume for present
purposes that the
structure of the proposed flotation will be as follows:
<P>

(a)	a new holding company (`HoldCo'), being a company limited by shares, will
be created;
<P>

(b)	the status of each of Association and Insurance would be altered from
companies limited by guarantee to companies limited by
shares and guarantee so
as to permit the issue of shares by each of them to HoldCo;
<P>

(c)	members of each of Association and Insurance will be offered, in proportion
to predetermined entitlement, the right to either
subscribe for shares in
HoldCo or to renounce the right to make such subscription;
<P>

(d)	those members that accept the offer of shares in HoldCo will be allotted
shares in HoldCo following the payment by them of a
subscription price which,
we anticipate, would equal the par value of the shares in HoldCo;
<P>

(e)	those members of Association and Insurance who renounce their rights to
subscribe for shares in HoldCo will receive an amount
of cash as further
explained in (g) below;
<P>

(f)	shares renounced by members of Association and Insurance will be pooled and
offered to institutions through a tender process
or some other underwriting
mechanism (for example, institutions could be asked to tender for the available
shares and, at the close
of the tender period, the price at which all shares
would be allocated to the institutions would be determined and the shares
allotted
accordingly);
<P>

(g)	upon allotment of the shares in HoldCo moneys subscribed by the
institutions (less costs associated with the tender/ underwriting
process)
shall be distributed to the members of Association and Insurance who renounce
their right to subscribe for shares in HoldCo,
in proportion to their
entitlement;
<P>

(h)	HoldCo will be listed on Australian Stock Exchange Limited;
<P>

(i)	at the end of this process HoldCo will own 100% of the issued capital of
Association and Insurance.
<P>

Shares in HoldCo will be issued at par and Counsel may assume that, once
issued, the shares will be worth considerably more than
their par value and
that this difference will be, as it were, a `windfall' for members of
Association and Insurance who participate
in the flotation scheme. We shall
return to the `windfall' later."
<P>

349	After reference to class rights under the memoranda and articles of the
companies, the brief continued -
<P>

"<b>4.	The Windfall</b>
<P>

As referred to above once issued it is likely that the shares in HoldCo will be
worth considerably more than the subscription price
(that is, the par
value).
<P>

One issue is whether the members of Association and Insurance may approve, or
could the directors approve, the issue of shares in
HoldCo carrying the
windfall to non-members including policyholders of Insurance who do not qualify
for membership of Insurance?
<P>

In the process of amending the Memorandum and Articles of Association of each
of Association and Insurance it will be necessary,
inter alia, to disclose
details of the windfall and the proposed recipients who will be entitled to the
windfall. Without full disclosure,
the proposal could clearly be vulnerable to
attack.
<P>

If the windfall goes to a wider class than members of both Association and
Insurance, then it follows that the amount of the windfall
available to those
members is reduced.
<P>

In the case of Insurance, the consent of Association, and probably the
directors appointed by the Council of the Association who
are members, is
required. The Council of Association presently has the power to give or
withhold that consent at a general meeting
of Insurance, but in doing so, the
Councillors must act in the best interests of Association and therefore its
members.
<P>

On the assumption the requisite majority of members in each relevant class
approves a proposal to issue shares on a windfall basis
to non-members being
policyholders, can dissenting members complain and what is the likelihood of
success? Secondly, could Association
members complain if shares are issued on a
windfall basis to members of Insurance by reference to their membership of
Insurance or
to persons who are not members of Association? This could arise,
for example, where the number of shares reflected membership of
Insurance in
some way eg premiums paid.
<P>

In essence the grounds of complaint would be either:
<P>

(a)	a fraud on the minority;
<P>

(b)	oppression either at general law or under Section 260 of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

We shall deal with these in paragraph 7 below.
<P>

<b>5.	The Winding up Provisions - Association's Share of Insurance's Net
Worth</b>
<P>

The extent to which Association is entitled to a share of Insurance's net worth
is likely to be a contentious issue.
<P>

As a guide, Insurance has a net worth of approximately $2.3 billion and
Association has a net worth of approximately $200 million.
 The quantum of
return to the members of Association and Insurance will be quite dramatically
affected depending upon the allocation
of Association's share of Insurance's
net worth.  This is demonstrated in the two pages briefed herewith referred to
in paragraph
9(d) of this brief.
<P>

As you will see from the attached pages, if Association is not given any right
to participate in the net worth of Insurance then
the allocation to Association
members would be approximately $100 per member, whereas if it were given a
right to participate to
a level of 50% of Insurance's net worth the allocation
to the members of Association would be $710 per member and, if Association
were
given a right to participate as to 100% of Insurance's net worth, the
allocation to Association members would be $1,320 per
member.
<P>

An issue which needs to be investigated and upon which Counsel's advice is
sought is whether, and to what extent, the winding up
provision contained in
clause 5 of the Memorandum of Association of Insurance entitles Association to
participate in the assets of
Insurance.
<P>

A concomitant issue with both commercial and legal ramifications is how
Association's special rights under the Memorandum and Articles
of Association
of Insurance can be valued and how this affects the allocation of Insurance's
net worth to the members of Association.
<P>

In any process of valuation, allocation and determining the level or quantum of
the rights of Association to the net worth of Insurance
the members of
Association and/or Insurance may seek to resort to legal action if they feel
there is justification for doing so.
<P>

As with our discussion above concerning the `windfall' the relevant grounds of
complaint would be either:
<P>

(a)	a fraud on the minority;  or
<P>

(b)	oppression either at general law or under section 260 of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

<b>6	Major Issue - Scheme of Arrangement or General Meeting</b>
<P>

The major issue that needs to be considered and on which Counsel's advice is
sought is whether the resolutions which will need to
be passed by Association
and Insurance to facilitate the flotation is best achieved by:
<P>

(a)	a scheme of arrangement under Section 411 of the Corporations Law;  or
<P>

(b)	extraordinary general meetings of the members of Association and
Insurance.
<P>

Historically, meetings of members of Association have a voter turnout of
approximately 5% of members (as mentioned in 3 above, the
total membership of
Association is approximately 1.9 million members) and meetings of Insurance
have a voter turnout of approximately
1% of members (the total membership of
Insurance is approximately 1.6 million members).
<P>

The obvious advantage of a scheme of arrangement for each of Association and
Insurance is that the schemes would be binding on the
members of each assuming
the schemes were approved by the Court.  If it was desired to provide benefits
to non-member policyholders
a scheme would be advantageous but perhaps not
absolutely necessary.
<P>

A disadvantage of proceeding by the scheme of arrangement route is that in
doing so a forum is readily provided for opponents of
the proposals to express
their opposition and generally put their views on the matter.
<P>

In determining whether to sanction a scheme the classic formulation of the test
which the court will apply is whether `an intelligent
and honest man, a member
of the class concerned, acting in respect of his interests, might approve', the
scheme: In <i>re Dorman Long &amp; Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1934%5d%20Ch%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1934] Ch 635.</a> This test is
sometimes re-stated as whether `the arrangement can reasonably be supposed by
sensible business people to be for the
financial benefit of the classes of
persons concerned': <i>In re H Stanke &amp; Sons Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20SASR%20156" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] SASR
156.</a>
<P>

Although courts have power to withhold approval because a scheme is
unreasonable, they are reluctant to make commercial judgments.
According to
Bowen, LJ, <i>in re Alabama, New Orleans Texas and Pacific Junction
Railway</i><u> </u><i>Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%201%20Ch%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 1 Ch 213</a> at 243: `A reasonable compromise
must be a compromise which can, by reasonable people conversant with the
subject, be regarded as
beneficial to those on both sides who are making it'.
Lindley, LJ, in the same case, said that the matter was to be looked at from
a
commercial, rather than legal, viewpoint.
<P>

In our view, the relevant resolutions may be passed by members of Association
and Insurance in general meeting without recourse
to a court approved scheme of
arrangement. In either case, however, we need to consider the issue of
oppression both at general law
and under Section 260 of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

<b>7.	Oppressive Conduct</b>
<P>

Broadly, the argument would be that the majority of members or directors either
misused their power to the detriment to the minority
or acted oppressively or
in a manner that was unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory
against, a member or class of members
or contrary to the interests of members
as a whole.
<P>

If the action involves a fraud on the minority in accordance with common law
principles, it is in our view more than likely that
action would also be
available under Section 260. The courts have pointed out that Section 260 and
its predecessors are intended
to provide a greater measure of curial protection
to members of the company and have been drafted in wide form in order to
accommodate
the almost limitless varieties of oppressive behaviour possible and
the need for the court to have an appropriately extensive discretionary
power
to effect justice in the particular circumstances of individual cases see
<i>Jenkins v Enterprise Goldmines NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%206%20ACSR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 6 ACSR 539</a> and <i>Re Bodaibo
Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%206%20ACSR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 6 ACSR 509).</a>
<P>

There have been a large number of cases on what conduct is `oppressive or
unfairly prejudicial' and, in summary, the cases reveal
the following:
<P>

[Here were set out lettered sub-paragraphs a number of propositions and case
references.]
<P>

Courts have traditionally been reluctant to claim intervention as a role in
relation to commercial judgments and whilst <i>Wayde's</i> case may suggest
that this traditional reluctance may be overborne by the section, it does not
alter the position that the court
will not second guess commercial decisions,
although there is nothing preventing a court from doing so.
<P>

The recent decision of the NSW Court of Appeal in <i>WCP Limited v Gambotto</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 385</a> involved an amendment to the articles of association of a
company to enable the major shareholder, which held approximately 99.7%
of the
issued capital of the company, to acquire compulsorily the 0.3% not already
held by it at fair value.
<P>

In his judgment, Meagher JA points out that the leading case in the doctrine of
majority oppression is the decision of the English
Court of Appeal in <i>Allen
v Gold Reefs of West Africa, Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%201%20Ch%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] 1 Ch 656.</a> In that case the
court held a new article extending a company lien over partly paid shares to
fully paid shares was valid. Lindley
MR, when dealing with the majority's power
to change the articles (at 671) said:
<P>

`... it must be exercised, not only in the manner required by law, but also
bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole,
and it must not be
exceeded.'
<P>

Meagher JA points that initially these words of Lindley MR were taken as
setting two requirements, namely:
<P>

	(i)	that the alteration should be made in good faith; and
<P>

	(ii)	that it should intend to benefit the company as a whole.
<P>

The test propounded by Lindley MR in <i>Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa,
Limited</i> was discussed in some detail by Latham CJ and Dixon J in <i>Peters'
American Delicacy Company Limited v Heath</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2061%20CLR%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 61 CLR 457.</a> Their Honours
in that case pointed out, amongst other things that:
<P>

(i)	Lindley MR's test, although constantly invoked, was almost meaningless;
<P>

(ii)	in many cases, the proposal was so obviously beneficial to the company
that the amendment to the articles in question must
necessarily be valid;
<P>

(iii)	in every case the proposed amendment would be ex facie invalid, for
example, if it involved misappropriating shares without
compensation, depriving
the minority of voting rights, allowing the majority to acquire the company's
property at an undervalue;
<P>

(iv)	the test of Lindley MR was wider than was necessary for the purposes of
that case. There would have been less confusion in
later cases if Lindley MR's
words were taken as merely laying down a negative test rather than a positive
test which must be complied
with in all cases; and
<P>

(v)	where it was arguable whether a test was beneficial for the company, the
court would not substitute its views for those of the
shareholder. In such
cases it will simply decline to interfere.
<P>

In the<i> Gambotto</i> case Meagher JA pointed out that the evidence
demonstrated that there would be taxation advantages for the company if
minority shares
were appropriated and there would be considerable
administrative savings if such an appropriation took place. As referred to
above,
there was no allegation that the compensation provisions were
inadequate. In those circumstances the Court of Appeal could see no
reason to
interfere.
<P>

Turning to the question of the NRMA, the issue is whether if shares are issued
to persons who are not members, such issue having
been approved by the
requisite majorities of Association and Insurance in general meeting, or if the
flotation proceeded by way of
scheme of arrangement, the minority could
challenge the resolution or the scheme on the basis of the principles outlined
above.
<P>

It is, at this stage, possible to divide non-member policyholders into various
groups as follows:
<P>

(a)	those policyholders who have been disenfranchised from membership by
administrative error (eg omitting from proposal forms accidentally
the
agreement to be bound by the Memorandum and Articles of Association);
<P>

(b)	policyholders disenfranchised by operation of law (eg trade practices
legislation) or by other means not within the control
of the policyholder;
<P>

(c)	in other cases, policyholders may have unwittingly ordered their affairs so
as to deny themselves membership (eg the fact that
only the first-named holder
of a policy is qualified for membership).
<P>

Beyond these groups is a wider group of policyholders who have been offered
policies on the basis that no membership is offered.
 There are also those
policyholders who could not in any circumstances be members by reason of merely
holding a policy (eg policyholders
with NRMA Life Limited).
<P>

In our view a court would treat the NRMA Group's position sympathetically in
relation to those policyholders who were unwittingly
disenfranchised but we
would not be prepared to rule out the possibility of members being able to
bring a successful action under
Section 260 or on the basis of fraud on the
minority in the event that a wider group of policyholders who were not members
were provided
with the windfall.  The likely success of such an action
increases as the class of non-members is expanded and the expansion is not
the
correction of past errors, but the true expansion of the class of members.
<P>

A further issue is whether or not the members of the Association could complain
if the windfall was offered to members of Insurance.
 In our view, such a
complaint would have little prospects of success.  In the first place, most
members of Insurance would be members
of Association or, alternatively,
employees or members of other organisations approved by the Association.
Secondly, it is Insurance
which has provided the economic wealth.  Association
as a member of Insurance, could, in our view, agree to this as being a matter
properly in the best interests of Association as the Association requires the
approval of the ordinary members of Insurance to unlock
the wealth of Insurance
for the benefit of the members of the Association.
<P>

The concerns raised by Section 260 that the class of members be expanded to
include people who are presently non-members of Insurance
can be alleviated in
part by taking, for example, the following step:
<P>

(a)	as part of the resolutions dealing with the change of status and the issue
of shares, the Articles of Insurance could be amended
so as to make some
policyholders members, provided that those policyholders who thereby become
members do so on a properly explicable
basis, eg administrative error, legal
constraints or some other similar basis;
<P>

(b)	rather than providing to these policyholders the `windfall', it may be
proper to provide them with some preference in the allocation
of shares not
taken up by members at a price which gave them some recognition of their
contribution as policyholders.
<P>

In our view the prospects of a successful action under Section 260 of the
Corporations Law would increase if, for example, the class
of members of
Insurance was expanded to include, say, policyholders of the NRMA Life Company
who presently have no entitlement on
any basis to membership.  The group that
lies between these two classes presents a more difficult problem:  these are
those policyholders
who are not qualified members because they are not the
first-named in the policy.  This would require an amendment to Article 4 and,
on balance, we believe that a change in the basis of this class of benefits as
a participant in the windfall, may well be successfully
challenged under
Section 260.
<P>

A further issue is whether or not the members of Association and/or Insurance
could complain about any allocation to Association
of a share of the net worth
of Insurance.
<P>

<b>8.	Questions</b>
<P>

Counsel is briefed to advise generally in relation to the above matters and
specifically on whether Counsel can confirm our view
that we believe that it is
not necessary for the NRMA Group to proceed by way of scheme of arrangement
under Section 411 of the Corporations
Law to realise the successful adoption of
the relevant resolutions.
<P>

We also seek Counsel's advice as to whether, if a person brought an oppression
action challenging the proposals, steps would be
available to NRMA to conclude
the oppression action expeditiously.
<P>

Our view is that the relevant resolutions may be passed by the members of
Association and Insurance in general meeting and that,
despite the difficulty
in dealing with persons who are presently non-members, those difficulties may
be overcome in a manner which
brings some non-members into the membership fold
without exposing the Association and Insurance to successful claims under
Section
260 under common law."
<P>

350	Before going to the conference of 14 December 1993, some matters may be
noted.  
<P>

351	First, the proposal was essentially the same as earlier stated, and in
particular involved payment of the par value of the shares
to be issued by the
holding company.
<P>

352	Secondly, the brief sought specific advice about whether it is "necessary
for the NRMA Group to proceed by way of scheme of
arrangement ... to realise
the successful adoption of the relevant resolutions", that being the "major
issue" identified in the brief.
 Although when earlier identified the issue had
been whether "the resolutions ... is best achieved" by scheme or meeting (an
infelicitous
phrasing but clear enough), this question for specific advice was
one of ability to bind members and not one of possible oppressive
conduct.  The
specific advice sought was by way of confirmation of AAH's view, and AAH's view
as expressed put aside as a separate
matter the issue of oppression.  
<P>

353	Thirdly, the brief also sought specific advice about whether "if a person
brought an oppression action challenging the proposals,
steps would be
available to NRMA to conclude the oppression action expeditiously".  In terms,
this was procedural - not whether the
oppression action was likely to succeed,
but how it could be quickly dealt with.  In the body of the brief complaint and
success
in complaint of oppression were raised as issues, but not as matters
for substantive advice.  It was as if an oppression action was
seen as likely,
if not inevitable, whether the members' resolution route or the scheme of
arrangement route was taken.
<P>

354	Fourthly, the brief also sought advice generally, but it was not clear what
that meant.  It could have meant advice as to anything
touched on in the brief,
for example, whether and to what extent the winding-up provision in the
memorandum of Association entitled
it to participate in the assets of Insurance
(described as something on which advice was sought when mentioned) or the
likelihood
of success of a complaint of oppression in relation to shares issued
to non-member policyholders (not so described when mentioned).
 The generality
was underlined by the brief's closing reference to AAH's view concerning
difficulties in dealing with non-members,
as if only such dealings might bring
complaint of oppression, when the brief had referred also to complaint by
members of Association
if the windfall were offered to members of Insurance
and, in one sentence, to complaint by members of Association and Insurance if
a
share in the net worth were offered to members of Association.   
<P>

355	Fifthly, the reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i> was not in connection with
the "major issue", but in connection with oppressive conduct and whatever may
have been asked of Mr Heydon
in that respect.  It was in the part of the brief
to do with oppressive conduct, it followed a summary of what, on the cases, was
oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct, and it was plainly enough cited as
a recent illustration of no unfairness in the majority's
exercise of its power
to change the articles.  The brief did not treat <i>Gambotto's case</i> as
going to whether the fact of something like expropriation would make an
exercise of the power to amend articles invalid - indeed,
oppression was seen
as a constraint on both proceeding by scheme of arrangement and proceeding by
members' resolution (see "In either
case, however, we need to consider the
issue of oppression ..." ).  This is not surprising, given the views held by Mr
Morgan and
Mr Simpson:  in their view, the issue was whether there was fair
compensation and no oppression.
<P>

356	Sixthly, and following from the last observation, what might be thought
surprising is that Mr Bateman's grounds for doubting
the members' resolution
route were not exposed in the brief, and that <i>Gambotto's case</i> was not
cited in the brief in that connection.  There seemed to have been a shift from
concern over crunching out members' rights
(I use the vivid phrase even if it
was not used at the time) to concern about fairness of entitlements.  The
latter was a valid concern,
but the former remained.  As I have indicated, the
advice which Mr Morgan was instructed to obtain on 6 December 1993 amounted to
advice as to whether the fact of something like expropriation might make the
exercise of the power to amend the articles invalid.
 He did not identifiably
ask for hat advice, and it is curious that Mr Bateman did not suggest that the
brief clearly extend to it.
<P>

357	Seventhly and finally, given the obscurity in some respects of the brief,
and its late delivery, it could not reasonably have
been expected that Mr
Heydon could advise early on 14 December 1993, without further information or
at all.  It is no wonder that
the conference on 14 December 1993 was only
exploratory, and that a revised brief was then provided to Mr Heydon on 15 or
16 December
1993.
<P>

<b>The conference of 14 December 1993 and Mr Heydon's advice</b>
<P>

358	For what follows, it should be recalled that the decision of the Court of
Appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> had been given on 7 May 1993, and the brief of
13 December 1993 cited that decision:  it must also have been the decision
referred
to on 6 December 1993.  The decision had been reported in the New
South Wales Law Reports, and the citation in the brief shows that
the report
was available prior to December 1993 and was known to AAH.  
<P>

359	The report contained at the foot of the first page, as was customary when
it was so, an editorial note, "An application for
special leave to appeal to
the High Court has been filed".  The application for special leave to appeal
had been heard, and granted,
on 10 December 1993.  The defendants' knowledge of
the application for special leave to appeal, of the grant of leave to appeal,
and in due course of the hearing of the appeal on 21 April 1994, was to some
extent in question in these proceedings.  
<P>

360	Present at the conference on 14 December 1993 were Mr Heydon,
Ms Godwin, Mr Morgan, Mr Simpson, and Mr Bateman.  There was
quite
a divergence in the recollection of what occurred.  It is best exposed by
describing their recollections in a different order.
<P>

361	Mr Morgan's note of the conference recorded those present and simply,
"Discussed Brief".  Despite the brevity of the note, in
a witness statement
Mr Morgan said that he recalled that there was a detailed discussion about
provisions of the Law, and that Mr
Heydon said "<i>Gambotto</i> must be
right.  It must be right that you can go by way of members' meetings rather
than by scheme of arrangement".  According to
Mr Morgan, no one else present
expressed disagreement.  
<P>

362	Mr Morgan's oral evidence concerning the reference to <i>Gambotto's
case</i> was slightly different.  He said that he drew the case to Mr Heydon's
attention, that Mr Heydon then picked up a report of the case
and read it or
part of it, and that there was some discussion about the decision and in
particular its facts and Mr Heydon made a
comment -
<P>

" ... I believe after some interchange with me, to the effect - on the issue of
whether a members' resolution could be used to bind
members in terms of - I
don't think the word `expropriated' was used, I don't recollect that, but the
effect of expropriation or
taking away members' rights.  He said words to the
effect that, following his reading of Gambotto, `well, that must be right',
meaning
that that must be right that you can do it by members' resolution".

<P>

Mr Morgan's recollection in his oral evidence was that the case was not
discussed in the context of oppression, and his evidence
was that while he
thought it was "substantially an oppression case" there was also "an underlying
issue as to whether or not members
could resolve to take away membership at
all".  He had no recollection of reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i> being on
appeal to the High Court, while saying that it was possible that someone at the
conference did so refer to it.  It was Mr
Morgan's vague recollection that he
first became aware of the appeal, at the time awareness that the High Court had
heard the appeal,
at some time during the proceedings before Gummow J.
<P>

363	Mr Bateman's note of the conference said only "discuss the issues of
(a) res of members vs scheme;  (b) entitlements".  According
to Mr Bateman, Mr
Morgan went through the matters and issues referred to in the brief, with
occasional comments from Mr Heydon and
himself.  His recollection was not that
Mr Heydon said that <i>Gambotto's case</i> must be right and it must be right
that the members' resolution route rather than the scheme of arrangement route
could be used,
although his understanding from the conference was that it was
Mr Heydon's tentative view that the members' resolution route could
be used.
He was unsure whether in the course of the conference he explained the doubts
which he had voiced on 3 and 6 December 1993.
 
<P>

364	But, still according to Mr Bateman, there was reference to <i>Gambotto's
case</i> being on appeal to the High Court (but not more specifically to the
matter of special leave to appeal), and Mr Morgan said that he
had spoken
to Mr Arthur Emmett QC, who had appeared for the successful party in the
Court of Appeal, and that Mr Emmett considered
that the appeal to the High
Court would not be successful.  And in the course of the conference
Mr Morgan outlined timing for the
restructuring involving meetings of the
members of Association and Insurance in September or October 1994 and listing
of the holding
company in about November 1994, and Mr Heydon said,
"Whatever significance the Gambotto case may have, by the time the High Court
hears the appeal, reserves its decision and then hands down its judgment, it
will be well after all of the milestones and steps have
been taken to list the
new NRMA company on the stock exchange".  
<P>

365	Mr Heydon had no real note of the conference.  In preparing for the
conference he jotted a few words on a piece of paper, "no
spec resn needed of
Assn (?), only of Insurance", plus the word "Gambotto", and in the conference
he made a few notes on the briefed
material recording explanations given by Mr
Morgan.  His evidence in his witness statement was general, to the effect that
there
was detailed discussion about provisions of the Law, mainly an analysis
of them by Mr Morgan in the course of a lengthy exposition
of the NRMA
demutualisation as then planned and whether it could be effected by members'
resolution or by scheme of arrangement.
 
<P>

366	In his oral evidence Mr Heydon gave a more detailed recollection of the
conference.  It was quite extensive, and involved Mr
Morgan inquiring into the
possibility of joint opinions with Mr Emmett, explaining matters concerning the
NRMA and its activities
and the proposal as it then stood, referring to the
articles of Association and Insurance and provisions of the Law, and asking
whether
Mr Heydon thought there was any obstacle to proceeding by way of
special resolutions carried through general meetings of the two
companies.  Mr
Heydon could not remember his answer at that point.  He recalled Mr Morgan
asking for a written opinion in the next
few days, there was discussion of the
end time of 20 December 1994 and the commitment to the current case, and Mr
Heydon said that
subject to that commitment he would endeavour to do the
opinion by 20 December 1994.  
<P>

367	According to Mr Heydon, when Mr Morgan was explaining the proposal he said
that it was preferred to proceed by having general
meetings and special
resolutions of the companies in general meeting, rather than using s 411 of the
Law, because the scheme of arrangement
route "gives dissidents a platform, as
it were, to express their opposition, which they might not necessarily - which
is a course
they might not necessarily adopt if the procedure was simply by way
of attempting to get special resolutions passed by general meetings".
 Mr
Morgan talked of the windfall and how it should be distributed amongst the new
shareholders in the holding company, and of whether
it would be possible to
give the windfall to people who were not members of Insurance but nonetheless
had a policy with Insurance
and of problems of whether non-members of
Association and Insurance should get any part of the companies' wealth.  He
adverted to
class rights and, still according to Mr Heydon -
<P>

"He said, as I said earlier, `We have to consider the questions of class
rights, questions of oppression and s 260.  We have set
out in the brief some
of the cases on 260 and that area of law.  The most recent case is a decision
of the Court of Appeal in <i>Gambotto</i> this year.  Have you been able to
look at that?'  I said, `Yes, I have looked at that' and I think I had the
volume on the desk.
 He said, `What do you think of that?'  I can't remember
precisely what I said, but I said words to the effect that it seems reasonable
or it seems okay."  
<P>

368	Mr Heydon thought he had read the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> before the conference, as his note might suggest, but
his recollection was that oppression and the decision of the Court of Appeal
in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> were mentioned only briefly and at the end of the
conference.  While he may have said that he though that <i>Gambotto's case</i>
was correct, and he did think it was correct, he did not recall anything being
said about it being subject to a High Court appeal,
and he did not recall
reference to Mr Emmett or Mr Emmett's views.  He did not recall being
told about timing or milestones, and
was not shown any timetables, and did not
recall saying what Mr Bateman attributed to him.  He doubted that he was
aware that special
leave to appeal had been granted, since that had been only
two days before the conference and he had not been in the High Court on
that
day, and he was sufficiently doubtful that he would deny that he was aware;
further, while he may have become aware that the
application for special leave
had been filed, he could not remember whether he was conscious of it at the
conference, and he did
not know that an appeal had been heard until after the
High Court's judgment in March 1995.
<P>

369	Mr Heydon doubted that he had said that it must be right that you could go
by way of members' meeting rather than by scheme
of arrangement, as it was the
question to be advised on in writing after more detail consideration of the
brief, and did not recall
the words attributed to him by Mr Simpson, to which I
will shortly refer, but accepted that he may have said "something more
tentative
or provisional about the possibility of proceeding by way of members'
meetings". Mr Heydon's general recollection was that the conference
was
preliminary to his detailed consideration of the brief, which had only arrived
a short time before, and that whatever he said
was in provisional terms.
<P>

370	According to Mr Simpson, in the course of the conference
Mr Heydon said words to the effect, "My preliminary view is that a
scheme
of arrangement is not necessary.  I'll consider it further.  I've read
<i>Gambotto</i>.  I think Meagher's judgment is quite strong.  I think fairness
is the key."  Mr Simpson acknowledged that he (Mr Simpson) might
have known at
some time of an application  for special leave to appeal and an appeal, but
could not remember knowing:  at one point
he said that he had a recollection of
asking a solicitor at AAH to check what had happened or was happening in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> after the decision of the Court of Appeal, but was not
sure of this or when, if at all, it occurred, and as I have said he later
described it as speculation.
<P>

371	Mr Morgan denied saying anything about Mr Emmett and his views,
and Mr Simpson did not recall any such thing.  Mr Morgan did
not
specifically confirm, deny, or express lack of recollection of the statement
attributed to Mr Heydon concerning significance
and milestones, but such a
statement could not stand with Mr Morgan's evidence that he was unaware of the
appeal.  Mr Simpson said
that Mr Heydon might have said words to the
effect recounted by Mr Bateman, but that he could not recall them.  While he
recalled
Mr Heydon's reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i> during the conference,
he could not recall whether anyone said that it was on appeal to the High Court
or any reference to special
leave to appeal;  Mr Simpson's recollection of the
conference was quite limited.
<P>

372	Ms Godwin seems normally to have taken reasonable notes of meetings,
but her note of the conference recorded only the participants
and time, with
nothing thereafter.  (There was a doodle in the margin:  it can not have been a
momentous occasion for her.)  She
had no real recollection of the conference.
She recalled that the proposal was discussed in general, and that
Mr Heydon said it seemed
"alright", adding that he "wasn't really advising
at that point" and that he "wanted to look at his end".  She had no
recollection
of anything said about a scheme of arrangement being necessary or
unnecessary.  She said that she thought the name Gambotto came
up at the
meeting, and she said that after the meeting she asked Mr Bateman "what
Gambotto was about";  her best recollection of
the answer was that it was
something to do with oppression.  At the time Ms Godwin had the general
understanding that oppression
was where a majority of members were trying to do
something which was unfair to a minority of members of the company.  Ms Godwin
recalled that this exchange with Mr Bateman was when she, Mr Morgan and Mr
Bateman were in a coffee shop, and that in the course
of it reference was made
to<i> Gambotto's case</i> being on appeal to the High Court.  
<P>

373	In the end I do not think much will turn on the divergences in
recollections of what occurred at the conference.  The recollections
were
incomplete and imperfect, and the divergences were quite marked.  Guidance as
to what was said at the conference is to be found
in what followed the
conference.  
<P>

374	I do not think that Mr Heydon said definitely that "it must be right that
you can go by way of members' resolution", although
it is likely that he
expressed a provisional view to that effect:  as will appear, within a short
time he gave firm advice to that
effect.  That was the "major issue" in the
brief, and was isolated for Mr Heydon's advice in the next few days.  Nor do I
accept
that, if Mr Morgan intended by his evidence so to convey, Mr Heydon
referred to <i>Gambotto's case</i> as the reason why proceeding by resolutions
in general meetings must be right.  <i>Gambotto's case</i> was not mentioned in
the firm advice which was shortly given, and while there was reference to
<i>Gambotto's case</i> in the conference and Mr Heydon probably expressed the
view that the decision of the Court of Appeal was correct I consider that
was,
as Mr Heydon recalled, in connection with oppression as the broad separate
matter raised in the brief.  In these respects I
prefer the evidence,
<P>

 essentially, of Mr Heydon to that of Mr Morgan.
<P>

375	Of more difficulty is whether there was reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i>
being on appeal to the High Court.
<P>

376	Where the editorial note in the report disclosed an application for special
leave to appeal, that Mr Simpson's researches would
have led him to note that
fact, to Mr Morgan also knowing of it, and to Mr Morgan speaking of it to Mr
Emmett, is understandable.
 Mr Emmett was in the wings as an additional or
alternative counsel to Mr Heydon, having been identified as possible counsel at
the
meeting of 6 December 1993.  His involvement was raised with Mr Heydon at
the conference, and he was in fact briefed with the same
brief as the revised
brief delivered to Mr Heydon on 15 or 16 December 1993.  Mr Morgan may well
have telephoned Mr Emmett to enquire
as to his availability, and the appeal may
then have been mentioned.  Reference at the conference to <i>Gambotto's
case</i> being on appeal to the High Court would have been unexceptional, and
if Ms Godwin's evidence is to be accepted there was like reference
in the
coffee shop.
<P>

377	A number of matters may be said to go against this.
<P>

378	First, if the appeal was mentioned it might be thought that there would be
a record of further enquiry into the fate of the
appeal.  There was not, but
rather there were the recollections of becoming aware of the appeal much later.
As to Mr Morgan's recollection,
that he became aware of the appeal at some time
during the proceedings before Gummow J received some small support from a note
made
by Mr Simpson on 22 September 1994 in relation to the Federal Court
proceedings, which included "Gambotto issue" and according to
Mr Simpson
recorded something Mr Morgan had told him about the claim of the applicants.
The support is small, because the Federal
Court proceedings commenced on 22
September 1994 were not founded on <i>Gambotto's case</i> and there was no
particular evidence of an occasion on which <i>Gambotto's case</i> might have
been referred to in connection with the proceedings, but it is possible that
some communication, even an informal one,
between the lawyers for the
respective parties brought a reference to it.  
<P>

379	On the other hand, Mr Morgan's vague recollection could have been of a
reawakened knowledge of the appeal, and later enquiry
into the fate of the
appeal depended on the perception at the time of the significance of the case
and the possible appellate result.
 Rightly or wrongly, at the time of the
brief and the conference it does not seem to have been perceived as significant
to proceeding
by members' resolutions, and while significance to oppression was
recognised that was not the "major issue" and the fundamental test
of fairness
for which the case was taken was not thought to be in doubt.  It is quite
possible, then, that reference to the appeal
at the conference would not have
remained in the minds of all the participants. 
<P>

380	Secondly, the response attributed to Mr Heydon may be thought unlikely.
The then anticipated timing was not as Mr Bateman recalled
was outlined, but
was to a shorter time-scale, and there could not have been confidence in the
passage of time before a decision
in the appeal.  
<P>

381	On the other hand, a passing comment about the relative times of the
decision and the float, where the possible appellate outcome
was not perceived
as particularly significant, may have been made, its detail wrongly recalled by
Mr Bateman.
<P>

382	Thirdly, there were reasons to doubt Ms Godwin's evidence about the like
reference in the coffee shop.  As will later appear,
there was another
conference with Mr Heydon on 2 February 1994, and Mr Bateman had a file note
showing that he, Mr Morgan, and Ms
Godwin then repaired to a coffee shop.
According to Mr Bateman, this was the only coffee shop occasion following a
conference with
Mr Heydon.  Ms Godwin agreed that she could not say that the
<i>Gambotto case</i> occasion was not on 2 February 1994.  
<P>

383	On the other hand, there was nothing to explain why <i>Gambotto's case</i>
should have excited Ms Godwin's interest on 2 February 1994, and when the case
was undoubtedly discussed, however briefly, on 14
December 1993 one would
expect Ms Godwin to have asked what it was about at that time rather than on
the later occasion.  Since the
draft brief had been provided to Ms Godwin, she
may well have known of <i>Gambotto's case</i> and been moved to know more about
it by the reference to it in the conference.  If Ms Godwin was in error in
placing the exchange
in a coffee shop, but it did occur after the conference of
14 December 1993, her evidence is of some value, because reference in
the
exchange to <i>Gambotto's case</i> being on appeal would show that there was
knowledge of the appeal as at 14 December 1993.
<P>

384	These and other indicators can not all be reconciled, and some of them
involve little more than speculation.  In my opinion
the more likely position
is that Mr Morgan did refer to <i>Gambotto's case</i> being on appeal, and
those at the conference were thereby made aware of the appeal if they were not
independently aware of it.  That
does not necessarily mean knowledge of the
grant of special leave to appeal on 10 December 1993, and the reference may
have been
to an appeal in a loose sense which could have conveyed either an
application for special leave to appeal or the grant of special
leave to
appeal.  After all, the law report disclosed the application for special leave
to appeal, and at least four of the lawyers
present should have read the law
report.  I accept the substance of the evidence of Mr Bateman on this matter,
broadly supported
as it is by the evidence of Ms Godwin, without accepting the
precise outlining of timing and response.
<P>

385	To return to what otherwise occurred at the conference, whatever was said
by Mr Heydon did not on any account extend to advice
that no problem of
oppression could arise in the demutualisation proposal.  It is entirely
understandable that, with such recent
delivery of the brief, that matter would
not have been gone into beyond an observation, with reference to <i>Gambotto's
case</i>, to the effect that fairness was the key in considering oppression.
That nothing more significant was said in relation to oppression
is supported
by Mr Morgan's later acceptance that Mr Heydon should not then advise on
"oppression or the other questions".  
<P>

386	At the conclusion of the conference Mr Morgan asked when the written
opinion would be available, and Mr Heydon said he would
try to provide it on or
before 20 December 1993 but it would depend on the then current case.  He asked
that Mr Morgan contact him
in the next few days to check on progress.  
<P>

387	Later on 14 December 1993 Mr Bateman sent to Ms Godwin an extract
from another document setting out passages from <i>Hennessy v National
Agricultural and Industrial Development Association</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%20IR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) IR 159</a>, saying
in his covering letter that it was relevant to the "`mass elimination' of
members of each of the Association and Insurance",
and should be drawn to Mr
Morgan's attention "so that Dyson Heydon can consider the <i>Hennessy case</i>
as part of the overall issue of whether there should be a scheme of arrangement
rather than simply special resolutions of members
of each of the Association
and Insurance".  This tends to support that Mr Heydon did not express a
definitive view in the conference.
 
<P>

388	Mr Simpson prepared a revised brief, and sent it to Mr Heydon on
15 or 16 December 1993.  It had some relatively formal changes,
including a
different division into sections, and some changed and additional observations
and questions in the body of the brief.
 The additional matters included a
sub-section addressing Association's rights to Insurance's net worth.  
<P>

389	The "major issue" was described in different terms, terms which more
clearly directed attention to the ability to proceed by
members' resolutions
and put aside any issue of oppression -
<P>

"<b>10.	Major Issue - Scheme of Arrangement or General Meeting</b>
<P>

The major issue that needs to be considered and on which Counsel's advice is
sought is whether the resolutions which will need to
be passed by Association
and Insurance to facilitate the proposal must, as a matter of law, be achieved
by:
<P>

(a)	a scheme of arrangement under Section 411 of the Corporations Law,
<P>

	or whether, in the absence of a legal requirement that the matters proceed by
way of scheme of arrangement, the proposals can be
realised by:
<P>

(b)	extraordinary general meetings of the members of Association and
Insurance."
<P>

390	There was a passage dealing with <i>Hennessy v National Agricultural and
Industrial Development Association</i>.  In the section concerned with
oppressive conduct there were added as examples of the reasons for an
oppression action a member
of Association and Insurance objecting to
Association members participating in the net worth of Insurance, a member of
Association
or Insurance "objecting to the broadening of the class of members
who participate in the scheme', and a person "objecting to disenfranchisement
as a result of the timing of the record date".  (The record date was to be the
date from which members would no longer be accepted
in the lead-up to the
meeting.)  
<P>

391	And the questions at the end of the brief were substantially reframed into
more precise questions -
<P>

"<b>12.	Questions</b>
<P>

(a)	<u>Main Issue</u>
<P>

On an urgent basis we seek Counsel's advice as to whether there is a legal
requirement to proceed by way of scheme of arrangement
under Section 411 of the
Corporations Law or whether it is sufficient if the necessary resolutions are
passed by members in general
meeting?
<P>

(b)	<u>Other Issues</u>
<P>

Also, and by way of summary of the above, we seek Counsel's advice on, and/or
confirmation of, the following matters:
<P>

(a)	where certain provisions of the Articles of Insurance are expressed as
giving the council of Association the relevant right
or power, that such right
or power is a right or power of Association, not of the councillors in their
capacity as councillors;
<P>

(b)	that the existing directors of Insurance (as opposed to all those persons
who have never been a director) constitute a separate
class;
<P>

(c)	the prospects of success of an action against Association and/or Insurance
based on any of the following reasons:
<P>

(i)	expansion of the class of members who are eligible to participate in the
flotation;
<P>

(ii)	the establishment of the record date.
<P>

		Would your answer to (c)(i) be different if the expansion of members resulted
from correcting past administrative errors rather
than for substantive
reasons?
<P>

(d)	do the directors of Insurance have power to declare and pay a dividend?
<P>

(e)	Can some of the net worth of Insurance be allocated to Association? On the
assumption that some of Insurance's net worth is
allocated to members of
Association, what is the prospect of a member of Insurance or Association
successfully challenging the allocation?
<P>

(f)	if a person brought an oppression action challenging the proposals, what
steps (if any) would be available to NRMA to conclude
the action
expeditiously?"
<P>

392	Again, the delivery of the revised brief indicates that Mr Heydon had not
expressed a definite view in the conference, on the
"main issue" let alone on
the "other issues".  The question in the "main issue" was now clearly separate
from the questions to do
with oppression in the "other issues", which later
questions were now much more precise.  <i>Gambotto's case</i> was still
referred to in connection with oppressive conduct, not the "main issue".
<P>

393	As things then stood, Mr Heydon was to provide a written opinion by 20
December 1993, subject to his commitment to the current
case.  According to
Mr Heydon, on 16 or 17 December 1993 Mr Morgan asked him how the opinion
was going, and he said that he could
deal with the "structural and machinery
aspects under the Corporations Law and the issue of which articles must be
amended" within
the time frame, but would not have time to consider and advise
on "oppression issues or the other questions" before the vacation.
 Still
according to Mr Heydon, Mr Morgan replied that it was not necessary for
him to deal with oppression or the other questions,
and that "What I need to
know is whether it is legally possible to effect the restructuring by members'
resolutions or whether a
scheme of arrangement is legally necessary".  There
was then some discussion of <i>Hennessy c National Agricultural and Industrial
Development Association</i>.  
<P>

394	Mr Morgan had a note of a conversation with Mr Heydon on 16
December 1993, uninformative as to content.  He did not recall the
terms of the
conversation, but said that it was possible that it was to the effect stated by
Mr Heydon.  
<P>

395	According to Mr Morgan, at the time he saw <i>Gambotto's case</i> as
contemplating that an expropriation of members' property could be oppressive
because of unfairness on the particular facts;  he
did not think that
Mr Heydon would be giving an opinion on whether the particular details of
any proposal would be oppressive or
unfair to members, because the details had
not yet been developed;  he thought that Mr Heydon would advise on whether
there was any
objection as a matter of principle to proceeding by way of
members' resolutions;  and while he thought that expropriation of members'
property in the absence of a scheme of arrangement could be oppressive because
of unfairness on the particular facts, he did not
think that there was any
issue as to whether expropriation of members' property in the absence of a
scheme of arrangement could as
a matter of principle be oppressive.  That Mr
Morgan would have replied as Mr Heydon stated is therefore quite
understandable, and
I accept that there was the conversation as recounted by Mr
Heydon.  Mr Morgan's view of <i>Gambotto's case</i>, as he recalled it, was
consistent with his stance on 3 and 6 December 1993, and with the brief,
including that he did not see the
case as going to whether the fact of
expropriation would exclude the members' resolutions route.  Fairness, or
oppression, was his
concern, and he saw <i>Gambotto's case</i> as a case on
oppression in the sense of fairness.
<P>

396	Mr Heydon provided a written opinion dated 20 December 1993.  He
recorded the steps set out in the description of the proposed
structure in the
revised brief.  He then said, in language reflecting the "major issue" in the
body of the brief -
<P>

"I am asked whether the resolution which will need to be passed by Association
and Insurance to effectuate the proposal must, as
a matter of law, be achieved
by a scheme of arrangement under s 411 of the Corporations Law, or
whether, in the absence of a legal
requirement that the matters proceed by way
of scheme of arrangement, the proposals can be realised by extraordinary
general meetings
of the members of Association and Insurance."
<P>

397	After immediately recording his conclusion that the proposals could be
realised by extraordinary general meetings of the members
of Association and
Insurance, Mr Heydon set out and discussed parts of s 167 and certain
other provisions of the Law and parts of
the memoranda and articles of
Association and Insurance.  
<P>

398	He identified the necessary changes to the articles of Insurance, and said
that in his opinion all necessary changes could be
made by special resolution
under the provisions of the Law.  In his discussion he said that the validity
of the alterations was conditional
on compliance with other provisions of the
Law, including s 260 
<P>

" ... which prohibits oppressive or unfairly prejudicial or unfairly
discriminatory conduct.  (This issue will be dealt with in
a separate
opinion.)"  
<P>

399	He went through the same process with the articles of Association, and said
that there was no bar to effecting the changes by
special resolution:  the same
conditions must have applied.  
<P>

400	Finally, Mr Heydon referred to <i>Hennessy v National Agricultural and
Industrial Development Association,</i> saying that there were dicta "to the
effect that a company limited by guarantee could not reduce its membership (and
the projected
proposals will have that outcome)".  After setting out the
relevant passages from that case, he concluded his opinion -
<P>

"These observations were made against a framework of legislation containing
much less extensive powers to amend the Memorandum of
Association than those
existing under the Corporations Law. No such limitations are to be found in the
language of the Corporations
Law. Further, the analogy between a reduction of
capital and a reduction of members who have given their guarantees is in my
opinion
weak; the central point of a company limited by guarantee is that it
has no capital, and hence rules against reduction of capital
can scarcely
apply, particularly in a context where the company is moving to the new status
of a company limited by shares and by
guarantee. Capital is being introduced,
not reduced. In my opinion <i>Hennessey's case</i> is no bar to what is
proposed.
<P>

It follows that in my opinion the proposals can be realised by appropriate
special resolutions passed at extraordinary general meetings
of the members of
Association and Insurance, and that a scheme of arrangement is not legally
necessary."
<P>

401	The opinion did not provide advice on the "other issues" in the brief, and
made no mention of <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  Mr Heydon had been told that it was
not necessary for him to deal with the other issues in the brief, and the
opinion included
that the issue of oppression would be dealt with in a separate
opinion.  As will appear when I come to Gambotto liability, this perceived
division between legal necessity and oppression was important in the failure to
advert to risk to the proposal from the appeal in
<i>Gambotto's case</i>.  The
decision of the High Court could be seen as concerned with oppression, but with
necessary oppression because of the expropriatory
nature of the resolutions,
and in truth it affected legal necessity.
<P>

402	Mr Morgan gave evidence that he took the opinion of 20 December 1993 to
confirm his view that a scheme of arrangement was unnecessary
in order to
implement the proposal.
<P>

<b>Development of the proposal</b>
<P>

403	The form of the restructuring was further considered at a meeting on the
morning of 4 January 1994.  Present at the meeting
were Mr Willing, Mr Rees, Mr
King, Mr Bernstein, Mr Pearce, Mr Conway, Ms Godwin, Mr Barry, Ms Birch, Mr
Arcus, Mr Stern, Mr Barrett,
Mr Morgan, Mr Bateman, and some others.  According
to the record of the meeting, there was "in principle approval" of a structure
involving an entity called "InvestCo", it seems in addition to the new holding
company and in some manner the means by which members
would be "given" (the
word in the record of the meeting) the NRMA's excess funds.  The form of
InvestCo and various other matters
were discussed, including the need to
"examine the mix cash/or shares in holding and/or InvestCo and the implications
of that mixture".
 There was also discussion of the use of the Foundation to
ensure the continuation of the NRMA's advocacy and community activities.
 
<P>

404	The role of InvestCo was a new matter, or at least new in its prominence,
and it is plain enough that there was much to be resolved
about the form of the
restructuring.  There was later discussion of the role of InvestCo, in which it
was proposed that it would
be the holding company of the holding company and
that members would be "offered an entitlement to receive a predetermined number
of shares in Holding Company and a predetermined number of shares in InvestCo":
the members could take up their entitlement "or they
may renounce their rights
and receive a cash amount based on the price paid by institutions and others
who will be offered the renounced
Holding Company and InvestCo shares".  The
shares in Association and Insurance would be issued to the holding company for
a nominal
sum, dividends would be declared up the line to InvestCo, and the
holding company (but apparently not InvestCo) would make a bonus
issue to
shareholders.  In another version, dividends would be paid by Association and
Insurance to members and applied to meet the
subscription moneys.  Many
complicated diagrams and lists of steps were prepared.  Taxation complications
were foreseen.  As will
appear, in early February 1994 the use of InvestCo
seems to have been abandoned.  
<P>

405	There was continued discussion on entitlements, with recognition of the
significance of the basis of entitlement to complaint
of oppression.  On 4
January 1994 Mr Morgan provided a paper describing "Major legal issues which
will need to be discussed in relation
to Project Christmas", and the legal
issues included "The oppression remedy - How can it be used to upset the
proposals?  Allocation
of entitlements" and "Entitlement of members of
Association to share in the net worth of Insurance - How are Association's
rights
to be `valued'?".  More attention was being given to value as part of
arriving at the basis for entitlement, and on occasions the
question of
entitlements was referred to as a question of value.  
<P>

406	Entitlements was the subject of a meeting on the afternoon of 4 January
1994, attended by the same persons as attended the meeting
on the morning of
that day, and according to the record of the meeting there was "in principle
approval" upon variation in entitlement
according to membership length and
possibly according to number of policies and membership of Insurance, and there
was considered
and noted for further thought setting a cut-off date for new
membership.  Again, it is evident that much more was to be done to finalise
a
basis of entitlement.  
<P>

407	On 5 January 1994 Ms Conway, Ms Godwin and Mr Bateman met to consider
establishing the cut-off date.  It was proposed that there
be a cut-off at
midnight on the day before the planned public announcement of the
restructuring, at that time 24 February 1994, but
subject to board decision and
with many details to be worked out.
<P>

408	It had long been recognised that members must be fully informed as to the
proposal (I have referred to a number of instances
of Mr Morgan so advising),
and it had also long been recognised that the proposal would require a
prospectus because of the issue
of shares, including to members of the public.
As early as the meeting of 3 December 1993 there had apparently been some
discussion
of what was involved in fully informing members.  Someone asked at
the meeting whether the notice of meeting or prospectus going
to members had to
set out a "no" case, that is, a or the case against the proposal in whatever
form it took.  It may have been on
this occasion that there was reference to a
"yes" case and a "no" case as on a referendum.  
<P>

409	The answer, according to Mr Morgan given by Mr Bateman, was recorded by Ms
Conway in the note, "notices must be fair but don't
have to specifically
include `no' case", and Ms Godwin's notes of the meeting included "no
obligation to canvass for a <u>No</u> vote (ie put a No case) but if you are
recommending a decision then the info accompanying it must be balanced".  Mr
Morgan expressed
agreement, and told those present that, if the notice of
meeting was part of a prospectus, it had to comply with the prospectus
requirements
of the Law as well, and so could not be misleading or deceptive
and had to contain all information which investors and their advisers
would
reasonably require and reasonably expect to find in the prospectus for the
purpose of making an informed assessment of the
financial position of the
company and the rights attaching to the shares.  According to Mr Morgan, he
said that the NRMA would have
to provide an explanatory statement which fairly
and reasonably set out the information necessary for a member to make an
informed
decision as to whether to vote in favour of or against the proposal.

<P>

410	It appears from Ms Godwin's notes that the idea of combining the notices of
meeting with the prospectus arose at this meeting:
 she recorded, "Information
memorandum accompanying the meeting notice must be as detailed as the
prospectus anyway, so why not send
prospectus with notice of meeting".  
<P>

411	Specific attention to the prospectus came much later, but Mr Morgan's legal
issues paper of 4 January 1994 identified prospectus
and due diligence
requirements as issues.  Mr Morgan provided a paper on the due diligence
process and a draft due diligence check
list on 4 January 1994.  
<P>

412	Amongst other things, the paper recommended the appointment of a due
diligence committee comprising representatives of the board
of the issuer, the
issuers' legal and financial advisers, the underwriter, and the underwriter's
legal advisers, and outlined a programme
for a due diligence exercise.  It
included -
<P>

"Briefly, a due diligence and verification programme must generally be
conducted in relation to a prospectus to ensure that the
content requirements
imposed on the prospectus by Division 2 of Part 7.12 of the Corporations Law
are not breached and, if they are
breached, that the issuer and its directors
and advisers and the Underwriter (`Persons Liable') will have the benefit of
the defences
available to Persons Liable in relation to such liability to the
maximum extent possible.
<P>

If there is a material statement in the prospectus that is false or misleading,
or a material omission from the prospectus, then
those involved with the
authorisation or issue of the prospectus potentially face criminal and civil
liability.
<P>

Persons Liable can avoid potential liability by acting in such a way that a
defence to criminal and civil liability is available
to them. This, the `due
diligence defence', is substantially contained in sections 996(2) (criminal)
and 1011 (civil)."
<P>

More will be said of the due diligence process, but the paper made clear, if it
was not already understood, that the prospectus
(and by inclusion or extension
the information to members) should not contain a material statement that was
false or misleading or
a material omission.  
<P>

413	There was a revision of the project management organisation.  An
organisational structure was circulated in January 1994.  At
the apex was the
steering committee comprising Mr Willing and Mr Rees.  At the next
level was Mr Rees as project manager, with the
assistance at that level of
Mr Stern as "timetable co-ordinator" and BT, PJP, Rowland, and the firm
Hogan Marketing Services ("Hogan"):
 the role of Hogan was indicated by its
name.  At the working level were four groups, described as "structure" headed
by Mr King,
"members' authorisation and logistics" headed by
Ms Conway,<i> </i>"communications" headed by Mr Rees, and "offer
process" headed by Mr Pearce.  
<P>

414	Although it seems to have received general approval, after some time this
project management organisation fell by the wayside.
 Amongst other matters,
the steering committee really did not function as such;  Mr King left the
NRMA;  in early April 1994, perhaps
when the magnitude of the task was better
appreciated, Mr Phil Hosking was brought in to manage the project in a
timetabling and
co-ordination sense;  and a number of the activities allocated
to the four groups were reallocated and redistributed amongst different
working
groups.  Logistically the project underwent change, and in this as in many
other respects the Legal Status Project was far
from fully formed, even for
presentation to the boards, in early 1994.
<P>

415	It was foreseen that the proposal would receive publicity, and on 5 January
1994 Mr Morgan wrote to Ms Godwin advising on pre-prospectus
advertising and
discussion of the proposal.  He suggested that the ASC be approached for an
exemption and other accommodation by
which the NRMA could participate in public
debate over the proposal prior to the issue of a prospectus.  In due course an
exemption
was obtained.  But the prospect of publicity, and the ability to
engage in public debate over the proposal, led to attention even
in January
1994 to what I have earlier described as external communications.  
<P>

416	Mr Barrett drafted a media release of 18 January 1994 and sent it to
Mr Morgan.  He said that there were many details still
to settle and that the
text was far from accurate in all areas, but that it gave "some idea of the
sort of things we would like to
be able to say ... but I would appreciate your
reaction".  
<P>

417	The draft, using a nom de plume, attributed to the person in fact
Mr Willing -
<P>

"Mr Smith said: `The Board has instructed management to evaluate the
possibilities, and the most likely scenario is a public listing.
The details
are to be investigated but this would involve giving each member, policy holder
and staff member shares or cash to the
value of at least $500 and possibly as
much as $2,000 based on length of membership and number of policies held".
<P>

The use of the word "giving" should be noted.  It was matched in a memorandum
on "advertising issues" dated 24 January 1994, which
included the
observation that the corporatisation of the NRMA "will be achieved by a share
allocation (at no cost) to the existing
member/policyholder owners of NRMA
Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited".  
<P>

418	At this stage in the development of the proposal it was not clear that the
shares would be at no cost.  The current thinking
was that members would
subscribe for shares at par value, lest there be the issuing of shares at a
discount, and someone noted "nominal
cost (eg 0.50) req'd" on a copy of the
memorandum last mentioned, adjacent to the words "at no cost".   However, from
the first involvement
of the marketing and public relations advisers the
message of shares at no cost was seen by them as important, and that was plain
in later events.
<P>

419	Starting in January 1994 BT prepared a series of timetables showing a
"critical path" for the Legal Status Project to its completion.
 So far as they
were historical the timetables were not accurate, either as to the steps taken
or when each was taken.  The first
timetable included that the step of
"recommend preferred structure"<i> </i>was completed by 4 January 1994,
which was accurate in the general sense of consensus on a holding company
structure but not accurate
in that the structure was otherwise still being
discussed and formulated.  It said that the step of determining whether a
scheme
of arrangement was required from a legal perspective was completed by
4 January 1994, distinguishing that from whether a scheme of
arrangement
was required from a commercial perspective as a step to be taken by
15 April 1994.  The meaning of requirement from a
commercial perspective
was not clear, but the first step was completed by 4 January 1994 to the
extent that Mr Heydon's opinion of
20 December 1993 dealt with it.  
<P>

420	The timetable was soon changed.  In a letter dated 19 January 1994 BT
commented on a proposed change whereby board approval
would be postponed from
24 February 1994 to 24 March 1994, spelling out some consequential changes
with the likelihood that the overall
timetable would be extended by four weeks.
At a meeting on 19 January 1994, 17 March 1994 was selected as the
likely day for announcement
of the proposal (and so for board approval).  On
24 January 1994 BT distributed an amended timetable in which there was
approval
by the board of Insurance on 17 March 1994 and approval by the
board of Association on 24 March 1994.  Why the different times for
the
boards was not explained.  
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed on oppression</b>
<P>

421	The agenda for the communications meeting held on 16 December 1993 included
"scheme or meeting?", but so far as appears there
was no report on that issue:
this adds support to the view that Mr Heydon had not given definite advice
at the conference on 14 December
1993.  At a meeting on 20 December 1993
attended by Mr Pearce, Ms Godwin, Mr Barry, Ms Birch,
Mr Stern, and Mr Morgan, the principal
discussion concerned when a
prospectus could and should be issued, but the record of the meeting included
under the heading "Comparison
of Scheme or Meeting" -
<P>

"Whilst a scheme is not the preferred route it is possible that we could be
forced to use it if there are otherwise insuperable
reconstruction problems (eg
taxation issues) comparison will include estimated length of court process or
description of that process
<P>

John Morgan to prepare by 4 January 1994"
<P>

It is not clear whether Mr Morgan had received Mr Heydon's opinion of
20 December 1993 before attending this meeting, although probably
he had not.
Nor is it clear what lay behind the possible forced use of a scheme of
arrangement or what Mr Morgan was to prepare.
<P>

422	At a communications meeting on 31 December 1993, attended by
Mr Willing, Mr King, Mr Burnstein, Mr Pearce,
Ms Conway, Ms Godwin,
Mr Ross, Mr Arcus, Mr Stern,
Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman, Mr Morgan said that Mr Heydon
considered that the restructuring could be
done by vote of members and a scheme
of arrangement was not necessary.  This left outstanding the "other issues" in
the revised brief
of 15 or 16 December 1993, and possibly the note in
Ms Godwin's record of the meeting, "Heydon's advise [sic] on value week
starting
24 January, 1994", contemplated further advice from Mr Heydon on the
"other issues".  As I have said, it seems that value was a way
of referring to
entitlements.  
<P>

423	So far as the evidence disclosed, the question of forced use of a scheme
for taxation or other reasons fell away.  Whether Mr
Morgan prepared something
by 4 January 1994 was unclear, but if he did it did not bring further
consideration of a scheme of arrangement.
 That may explain the date in BT's
timetable.  
<P>

424	But to the outstanding "other issues" was added a capital gains tax
question.  At the communications meeting held on 14 January
1994 Mr Morgan was
asked to reconsider the taxation implications of the restructuring, and on
18 January 1994 he attended a meeting
with Mr Pearce, Mr Paul
Baker (also of the NRMA) and Ms Birch, in company with Mr Larry Magid
and Mr Adrian Chek of AAH, principally
to do with taxation issues.
Mr Magid and Mr Chek were taxation specialists.  The immediate issue
was how to effect the restructuring
"tax effectively" without realising a
capital gains tax liability under s 160ZZS of the <i>Income Tax Assessment
Act</i>.  According to the record of the meeting, an opinion from Mr Heydon was
expected in the next week, and it was determined that the
brief would "then be
expanded to ownership from the context of section 160 ZZS (AAH to
do)".
<P>

425	As contemplated, although perhaps a little later than contemplated, on 25
January 1994 Mr Morgan delivered to Mr Heydon a brief
following on
from the revised brief of 15 or 16 December 1993.  The brief was prepared by Mr
Simpson.  As had Mr Morgan, he took
Mr Heydon's opinion of 20 December 1993 to
confirm that the proposal could be implemented by members' resolutions if fair,
that is,
not oppressive, but he was concerned about challenges to particular
aspects of the proposal - especially offering shares to non-members
and
allocating part of Insurances' net worth to Association - on the ground of
oppression.
<P>

426	The brief took up much of what had been said in the earlier brief.  It
repeated the description of the NRMA's then structure
and membership, adding a
reference to the provisions of the memoranda of each of Association and
Insurance in relation to distribution
of assets on a winding up.  It noted an
issue of the claim which Association may have to the assets to Insurance and
the allocation
of those assets to members of both Association and Insurance.
It repeated the description of the proposed structure, with the addition
of
InvestCo as a company, additional to HoldCo, shares in which would be allotted
to members on the payment of a subscription price
anticipated to equal the
"buyer value" of the shares.  As had been done in December, it was said that
the shares would be worth considerably
more than their par value, and that the
difference would be a windfall for members of Association and Insurance.  A
section of the
brief repeated the substance of the section of the earlier brief
to do with the windfall, and an expanded section of the brief dealt
with
Association's share of Insurance's net worth and concluded, in the same manner
as had the section in the earlier brief, with
the observation that there could
be complaint and legal action over the valuation and allocation of the net
worth of Insurance to
the members of Association founded on fraud on the
minority or oppression either at general law or under section 260 of the
Law.
 
<P>

427	But the brief omitted the section headed "Major Issue - Scheme of
Arrangement or General Meeting" from the earlier brief, and
went straight to
repeating, under the same heading, the substance of the section of the earlier
brief under the heading "Oppressive
Conduct".  In the body of that section
there were noted as "the issues for the NRMA", in slightly different terms from
the issue
for the NRMA in the earlier brief, whether members could mount a
challenge on the basis of the principles concerning oppression if
shares in
HoldCo and InvestCo were offered to non-members with the approval of the
requisite majorities of Association and Insurance
in general meeting, or if
part of Insurance's net worth was allocated to Association.  
<P>

428	The brief concluded with specific questions -
<P>

"<b>9.	Questions</b>
<P>

(a)	We seek Counsel's advice on the prospects of success of an action commenced
by members of Association and/or Insurance based
on any of the following
reasons:
<P>

(i)	expansion of the class of members who are eligible to participate in the
flotation; and
<P>

(ii)	the allocation of some of the net worth of Insurance to Association.
<P>

(b)	If a person brought an oppression action challenging the proposals, what
steps (if any) would be available to NRMA to conclude
the action
expeditiously?"
<P>

429	The brief was delivered under cover of a letter confirming a conference for
27 January 1994.  As envisaged at the meeting of
18 January 1994, on 27 January
1994 Mr Morgan sent to Mr Heydon an addendum, described in the covering
letter as focusing upon <i>"a capital gains tax issue in relation to which the
correct analysis of NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited is critical"</i>.

<P>

430	The addendum did not put a particular question or questions to
Mr Heydon, but described the issue as whether the natural persons
who
immediately before 20 September 1985 held a majority underlying interest
in the assets of Association ceased, and when they first
ceased, to hold that
interest.  Amongst the questions said to arise were whether the members of
Association held a majority underlying
interest in its assets and whether the
policy holders had any interest in the property of Insurance.  
<P>

431	Mr Morgan attended a conference with Mr Heydon on 27 January
1994.  The conference appears to have been of a preliminary nature,
and Mr
Heydon was not asked to express, and did not express, any opinion to do with
oppression or in answer to the specific questions
in the brief.  A further
conference was appointed for 2 February 1994.  
<P>

432	A letter dated 31 January 1994 confirming the further conference, a copy of
which was sent to Mr Bateman, restated the questions
for Mr Heydon.  It
included -
<P>

"At our conference last week I indicated that I would provide some further
information relating to the proposal for entitlements
and the particular
questions which we need to address at the conference this week which I confirm
at 7.30 am on Wednesday, 2 February
1994.
<P>

<b>Entitlements</b>
<P>

Broadly, the recommendations for entitlements are summarised in the attached
document.  In essence, the holding company will allocate
shares to members of
the Association by reference to years of membership and also by reference to
whether or not the member holds
a policy with Insurance.  Membership of
Insurance is not proposed to be a criteria of eligibility for the proposed
entitlements.
 The reasons for this proposed approach is that a number of
members of Association may well hold policies with Insurance (eg green
slips)
which would not qualify them for membership of Insurance.  The general proposal
is for a $500 minimum allocation up to an
allocation of $2,000.  At this stage,
these are indicative numbers and would require adjustment once final figures
are known but,
hopefully, will generally reflect the position.
<P>

<b>Questions for Senior Counsel</b>
<P>

1.	Does Senior Counsel essentially agree with the view we have taken as to the
nature of the existing entitlements of members of
Association and Insurance in
the Observations to Brief?
<P>

2.	What is the correct way, or preferable way, to approach the allocation of
the interest of Association in Insurance as between
the members of Insurance
and Association? Is it an interest of valuation or is it an interest, the
nature of which is not capable
of valuation but which is nevertheless real and
that, as a consequence, any allocation that is made must be perceived to be
fair
and reasonable having regard to that interest?
<P>

3.	Are there any steps which Senior Counsel believes should be taken to protect
against legal attack on the method of allocation,
eg an oppression suit?
<P>

4.	Does Senior Counsel believe that an allocation of entitlements in HoldCo of
the type outlined in the attachment could be successfully
made the basis of an
oppression suit?
<P>

5.	Could the Board of either Association or Insurance declare a dividend to
members and, if so, need it be an equal amount for each
member or could it
differentiate between members?
<P>

6.	Could Insurance and/or Association in general meeting (without amending the
Articles of Association) declare a dividend and could
that dividend be of a
different amount for different categories of member?
<P>

7.	Do members of Association hold an underlying interest in the assets of
Association in terms of Section 160ZZS of the Income Tax
Assessment Act and did
they hold such an interest prior to the amendment of the Memorandum of
Association of on 11 November 1992?
<P>

8.	Does a policyholder/member of Insurance hold an underlying interest in
Insurance?
<P>

9.	Does Senior Counsel have any other thoughts in relation to the application
of Section 160ZZS to Association and the change in
its Memorandum and Articles
on 11 November 1992?"
<P>

433	The attachment to do with entitlements was diagrammatic, indicating a
primary entitlement according to length of membership
of Association, and the
lengths, but that only those members of Association who held one or more
policies with Insurance should share
in what was called the Insurance pool and
that there might be special cases such as NRMA employees without Association
membership.
<P>

434	A short comment on the brief is appropriate.  It was a mixed bag,
particularly as expanded by the questions in the letter of
31 January 1994.
The area of discourse was entitlements, but the questions were concerned with
aspects of existing rights of members
as well as fair allocation between
members, plus the rather separate matter of an interest for capital gains tax
purposes.  The brief
did ask for advice, going beyond the procedural advice, on
the prospects of successful complaint of oppression (in the end, questions
3
and 4 in the letter of 31 January 1994).  <i>Gambotto's case</i> was still
referred to in the observations as relevant to oppressive conduct.  With the
addition of the capital gains tax questions,
the brief was taking up with
modifications the "other issues" from the December brief because they had not
then been the subject
of advice.
<P>

<b>The conference of 2 February 1994</b>
<P>

435	Present with Mr Heydon were Mr Morgan, Mr Bateman, and Ms Godwin.  Again,
there were divergent recollections of what occurred.
<P>

436	Mr Heydon's note of the conference read -
<P>

"Rights of member are bundle of rights - chose in action - under Mem + Arts.
<P>

Therefore Assn member - has no w.up rights
<P>

-  right to vote to change Articles so as to give right to take assets on
w.up
<P>

-  right to transfer membership
<P>

But no rights to underlying assets subject to change of arts re w.up.
<P>

Amend articles to permit dividends to be declared - differently for different
classes, + difft depending on length of membership"
<P>

According to Mr Heydon, the conference was taken up with discussion of the
nature of rights of members of Association and Insurance,
he was not asked to
deal systematically with the questions in the letter of 31 January 1994, and he
was not asked to answer, and
did not answer, the particular questions including
questions 3 and 4 dealing with oppression.
<P>

437	Mr Morgan had a more full note of the conference, but no significant
recollection beyond his note.  His note indicated that
the conference covered
more than Mr Heydon recalled:  it recorded four subjects, namely -
<P>

"1.	Dividend - No authority for company to do it
<P>

	Better for Articles to be changed to declare dividend
<P>

	Directors query [?]
<P>

	Therefore dividend ought be dealt with at general meeting
<P>

2.	Give benefits to members not non-members.
<P>

3.	Pure parity no problem.
<P>

	Greater disparity gives greater risk
<P>

	But rewarding loyalty relevant.
<P>

4.	Looks okay on distribution but query non-members.
<P>

	Non-members offer to HoldCo."
<P>

438	Mr Morgan gave evidence that one form of the proposal at the time involved
declaration of a dividend and the use of the dividend
to pay for shares in the
holding company.  He said that an issue was whether the boards of Association
and Insurance, or the companies
in general meetings without amendment of the
articles, could declare dividends, and in particular could declare dividends in
different
amounts for different categories of members, or whether amendments to
the articles were necessary for this to be done.  This gave
rise to questions 5
and 6 in the letter of 31 January 1994.  Based on his notes, he said that Mr
Heydon gave advice favouring amendment
to the articles (note 1).  Differential
dividends led on to entitlements, and again based on his notes Mr Morgan gave
evidence to
the effect that there was discussion of giving entitlements to non
members and advice against it (notes 2 and 4).  
<P>

439	From note 3, particularly the reference to risk, it would seem that there
was reference to oppression, that being a relevant
risk and no other risk being
suggested, and from note 4 it might be thought that Mr Heydon advised that,
provided the entitlements
were confined to members, there could be a
differential allocation of entitlements of the kind then contemplated provided
the disparity
was not too great.  But even if so, and it is speculation from
the notes, oppression may have been dealt with generally, and without
particular attention to the allocation of entitlements outlined in the
attachment to the letter or more specific advice or particular
attention to
questions 3 and 4 in the letter.
<P>

440	Mr Bateman's note recorded that the conference occupied an hour and twelve
minutes, but as to content said only "discussed:
 (a) dividend; (b)
entitlement".  Mr Bateman's recollection was that Mr Morgan talked about the
possibility of paying for the shares
to be issued by the holding company by a
dividend out of each of Association and Insurance, with members applying the
dividends in
paying up the shares to be issued, and that Mr Morgan also talked
about the nature of the framework for entitlements;  he had no
other
recollection.  
<P>

441	Ms Godwin had no note and no recollection of what occurred at the
conference.  
<P>

442	On any view Mr Heydon did not advise on the capital gains tax questions,
and if he had addressed the questions in the letter
of 31 January 1994 a
reflection of that in a later document or meeting would be expected.  There was
no such reflection.  When Mr
Morgan reported to a meeting on 4 February 1994
concerning capital gains tax, he made no mention of advice by Mr Heydon on that
matter.
 More particularly, in the continuing consideration of entitlements it
was not suggested that Mr Heydon had advised on a particular
approach to
allocation of the interest of Association in Insurance as between the members
of Insurance and Association, advised on
any steps to protect against legal
attack on the method of allocation, or approved any kind of allocation as
oppression-free.  According
to Mr Morgan, no one said to Mr Heydon that he
could or should disregard any of the questions in the letter of 31 January
1994. 
But Mr Morgan agreed that the questions were not gone through, and while
he said that "the substantive matter being discussed was
whether the proposal
for entitlements was one we could proceed with", the conference was conducted
without Mr Morgan seeking answers
to the questions. 
<P>

443	Mr Morgan said that he expected that, if there were any matters which
affected the legal acceptability of the proposed entitlements,
Mr Heydon would
raise them in the conference, but such an expectation went beyond even the
questions in the letter of 31 January
1994 and was not warranted.  The
conference proceeded in a manner whereby Mr Heydon was not required to answer
the particular questions
in the letter of 31 January 1994 (or the particular
questions in the brief).  Mr Heydon's task and advice in relation to
entitlements
and oppression was general.  So far as can be found, the advice
was to the effect that giving entitlements to non-members involved
risk (and
they should have to make an offer to HoldCo);  that disparity between members
brought risk but rewarding loyalty was relevant
to parity;  and that an
allocation of entitlements of the type outlined in the attachment to the letter
(which was itself broadly
expressed and with the figures subject to adjustment)
was unlikely successfully to be made the basis of an oppression suit.  Mr
Heydon's
advice in this last respect was less than definite, as the imprecise
phrase "looks okay" indicated.  
<P>

444	No one suggested that <i>Gambotto's case</i> was referred to at the
conference.  In one sense that is curious, since it was cited in the brief and
was a recent case to do with
oppression, and this conference, unlike the
conference on 14 December 1993, was concerned more with oppression in the sense
of fairness
than with the legality of proceeding by members' resolutions.  In
another sense it is not curious, since the advice was general and
it is
probable that, as earlier explained, the fundamental test of fairness was not
thought to be in doubt.  Again rightly or wrongly,
an appeal in <i>Gambotto's
case</i> was not seen at this conference as significant, and if, as I have
found, an appeal was mentioned on 13 December 1993, the minds of
those at the
conference did not turn to it.  
<P>

445	Mr Bateman's note also recorded that after the conference he, Mr Morgan and
Ms Godwin had a discussion over coffee:  I referred
to this when considering
the conference on 14 December 1993.  Mr Morgan had no recollection of such a
discussion.  As I have already
said, Ms Godwin had a recollection of a
discussion at a coffee shop after a conference with Mr Heydon, which she
originally placed
as following the conference of 14 December 1993.
<P>

446	It is, of course, possible that Ms Godwin asked about <i>Gambotto's
case</i> on 2 February 1994 because the brief cited it, even if it had not been
referred to at the conference.  But I remain of the view that
the occasion when
Ms Godwin asked about <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and there was mention of an
appeal, was more likely in connection with the conference on 14 December 1993.
If it was not, of course,
but  was following the conference on 2 February 1994,
the solicitors were aware of the appeal by or at that time.
<P>

<b>Further development of the proposal</b>
<P>

447	The taxation implications of the proposal remained prominent.  On 3
February 1994 Mr Morgan provided to Mr Rees and Ms Godwin
a memorandum to the
effect that, for capital gains tax reasons, a dividend in favour of members was
thought necessary.  On the same
day BT provided a paper to the effect that
taxation and other issues made InvestCo unattractive, and an alternative
involving targeted
shares was discussed.  At a meeting on 4 February 1994 it
was decided that the preferred approach was to seek legislative change
to
overcome the perceived capital gains tax impact, and Mr Morgan and Mr Magid
were asked to prepare a paper setting out the argument
and detailed proposal
for the legislative change and another paper on the fallback "worst case"
position.  
<P>

448	All this was material to the form of the restructuring, and in particular
to the question whether payment by members of the
par value of shares to be
issued to them, as was then intended, could be funded by declaration of a
dividend.  One of the matters
noted in the record of a communications meeting
on 11 February 1994 was:  "Issue:  Payment of par value decision dependent on
tax
position?", which according to Ms Godwin's more detailed note involved
whether members would have to "pay the par value".  
<P>

449	Discussion of entitlements continued, and there was proposed what was at
first called the confirmation letter and later became
known as the entitlements
letter, letters intended to tell members of entitlements and their own
entitlements and invite any disagreement
as to length of membership or other
criterion.  Mr Bateman was asked to work on the entitlements letters.  
<P>

450	Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman were also asked to work on the nature and form of
the resolutions which the boards would be asked to
approve.  Within the NRMA
there was discussion of when and how to inform staff, and more attention to
external communications (including
the beginning of steps towards a hot line to
deal with members' questions).  There was also discussion of the format of the
prospectus,
and Mr Bateman prepared drafts (later radically changed) of proxy
forms and a form for acceptance of shares in the holding company.
 This last
form called for the member to "accept in full the shares offered and lodge
Application Monies", and to attach a cheque.
 Marketing research was conducted,
and in the latter part of February 1994 the "Share the Future" slogan and a
logo taking it up
were devised and approved.
<P>

451	It was a time for getting into the detail of the Legal Status Project, in
these and a myriad of other respects, but progress
in settling the form of, and
in particular the method of implementing, the restructuring was dependent on
outstanding taxation questions.
 The restructuring alternatives were considered
at a meeting on 16 February 1994.  Present were Mr Willing, Mr Rees, Mr Pearce,
Mr
Baker, Ms Godwin, Mr Ross, Mr Barry, Mr Stern, Mr Morgan, and Mr Magid.  
<P>

452	Mr Morgan had prepared a number of papers for the meeting.  The "base
structure" then under consideration involved establishment
of what was called
HoldCo, offering to members of Association and Insurance predetermined
entitlements to shares in HoldCo, approval
by members of changes in the status
of Association and Insurance, and payment of dividends to members by
Association and Insurance
to be applied to meet subscription monies when the
shares were taken up:  if the entitlements were renounced, they would be taken
up by a trustee and offered to institutions or the public, and the proceeds
would be distributed to members.  An alternative, thought
possibly to overcome
a capital gains tax difficulty, had Association issuing shares to members which
they then exchanged for shares
in HoldCo, with Insurance becoming a subsidiary
of Association rather than of HoldCo.  Alternatively again, legislative relief
to
overcome the perceived capital gains tax difficulty could be sought.  The
taxation consequences, particularly as to capital gains
tax, with and without
legislative amendment, were detailed.  
<P>

453	The evidence did not go into the discussion at the meeting, but Mr
Bateman's note of the meeting recorded a query about how
the dividend could be
used to pay up the capital.  Mr Bateman's note of a meeting on 23 February 1994
included, it seems as a then
envisaged way of issuing shares in HoldCo, that
the par value of the shares would be paid for by differential dividends to
members
of Association, and that there would immediately be a bonus issue.  
<P>

454	At least to this point, there was no question of the shares being free, as
was reflected in a memorandum from Ms Godwin to Mr
Rees dated 23 February 1994
commenting on the proposed announcement of the proposal by Mr Willing.  Ms
Godwin said that a reference
to no payment for the shares should be deleted
because "Unfortunately as I understand it we cannot totally eliminate the need
for
at least some of the recipients of shares to pay the par value (or part of
the par value)."
<P>

<b>The question of non-responding members</b>
<P>

455	The consideration of the proposal, in particular the preparation of the
form for acceptance of shares in the holding company,
threw up the position of
members who did not respond by indicating acceptance of shares.  If they
neither indicated acceptance nor
renounced their entitlements (as the proposal
then contemplated they might), but were silent - were non-responding members -
could
they be made shareholders in the holding company by force of the special
resolutions, or would they be sent the cash flowing from
the trustee taking up
their entitlements?  
<P>

456	According to Mr Bateman, at the communications meeting on 11 February 1994
he and Mr Morgan had an exchange in connection with
non-responding members.  Mr
Morgan said that those who did not respond would be allotted and issued shares
by the holding company.
 Mr Bateman said that he did not think that he could
force the shares on people, they had to agree to become members and some
positive
step had to be taken.  Mr Morgan said that he could declare that he
held something in trust, and it was the beneficiary's until disclaimed,
and the
same could apply with the holding company and the shares for those who did not
respond.  Mr Bateman said that that might
be so in the case of a declaration of
trust, but not in relation to membership of a company where there had to be
agreement to become
a member.  Mr Morgan said that he would look into it, but
thought that shares could be allotted to a person who did not respond.
 
<P>

457	Mr Morgan did not recall the exchange on 11 February 1994, but agreed that
there might have been such an exchange, and I accept
that the two views on the
question of non-responding members were voiced as recounted by Mr Bateman.
<P>

458	The question was identified in Mr Bateman's notes of a meeting of 15
February 1994, "can you make people members of HoldCo if
they have not
responded (difficult position)".  In an AAH internal memorandum dated 23
February 1994 Mr Morgan said, "We are looking
at the issue of whether or not
shares can be issued, in effect, by way of gift and we are preparing a Brief
for delivery to Dyson
Heydon on that issue and will see him next week".  The
expression "by way of gift" could mislead.  Mr Morgan did not mean without
payment, but without indication of acceptance.  The relevance of the question
to these proceedings was not in relation to the free
shares question, but in
relation to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  In the course of the hearing the NRMA
suggested that their advice on the non-responding members' question was another
occasion
on which the solicitors, and Mr Heydon, could have been moved to give
the<i> </i>Gambotto advice.  As will be seen, in the brief to Mr Heydon there
was reference to a possible analogy between compulsorily making
people
shareholders (the non-responding members question) and compulsorily taking
their shares away (<i>Gambotto's case</i>).
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed on the non-responding members question</b>
<P>

459	The initial brief from AAH was dated 25 February 1994, and was sent to
Mr Heydon on that day.  The covering letter said - 
<P>

	"What is being considered is whether, in the case of those members who do not
respond to the HoldCo offer, we can impose a requirement
that non-responding
members will have shares allotted to them (as opposed to cash).
<P>

	In other words, is it possible to `force' the allotment of shares onto
non-responding members? The shares would be fully paid up
and the manner in
which that payment would be made is not a matter for the Brief."
<P>

460	The brief was replaced by a brief dated 7 March 1994, the day of the
conference at which Mr Heydon advised.  The difference
between the briefs was
the description of the proposal.  
<P>

The brief of 25 February 1994 began -
<P>

"Senior Counsel has already been briefed in relation to certain proposals
involving NRMA Limited (`Association') and NRMA Insurance
Limited
(`Insurance').  The purpose of this brief is to seek Senior Counsel's opinion
on one specific aspect of the proposals.  
<P>

The proposals envisage that a new holding company (`HoldCo') of the NRMA Group
will be established with 5 interim shareholders.
Association and Insurance will
each undergo a change of status from companies limited by guarantee to
companies limited by shares
and guarantee and each of their respective
memorandum [sic] and articles will be amended accordingly.
<P>

Members of Association and Insurance will be allotted shares in Association and
Insurance which recognises their `interest' in each
company. Senior Counsel can
assume for the purposes of the advice that the members of Association and
Insurance in general meeting
will approve the resolutions necessary to change
the status of each company.
<P>

Included in the resolutions will be a resolution approving the payment of a
dividend by each of Association and Insurance to their
members, which dividend
would be applied by each company to pay up fully the shares to be allotted to
members. Senior Counsel may
assume that if any Corporations Law approvals are
required for this purpose, such approvals will be obtained. Senior Counsel may
also assume that the resolutions amending the articles of each of Association
and Insurance will provide for the transfer of shares
in Association and
Insurance from members to HoldCo referred to below.
<P>

Members of Association and Insurance will then be offered to swap their shares
for shares in HoldCo (and HoldCo will become the
only member of each of
Association and Insurance). The offer by HoldCo to members of Association and
Insurance will enable members
to either:
<P>

(a)	be allotted shares in HoldCo; or
<P>

(b)	renounce their right to take the shares and receive cash instead (this cash
coming from the institutional tender referred to
in our previous Brief).
<P>

There will be a number of members who do not respond to the HoldCo offer and it
is obviously necessary to make provision for what
will occur if a member
doesn't respond, ie; does the member obtain shares or cash?
<P>

Consideration is being given to providing that all members who do not respond
to the HoldCo offer shall be allotted shares in HoldCo."
<P>

461	It will be seen that the description of the proposal was of a variant in
which Association and Insurance issued shares to members
which they then
exchanged for shares in HoldCo.  
<P>

462	In the replacement brief the description, in substitution for the third,
fourth, and fifth paragraphs in the extract just set
out, was -
<P>

"There are then two options under consideration.
<P>

1.	Members of Association and Insurance will be allotted shares in Association
and Insurance which recognises their `interest' in
each company. Senior Counsel
can assume for the purposes of the advice that the members of Association and
Insurance in general meeting
will approve the resolutions necessary to change
the status of each company.
<P>

	Members of Association and Insurance will then be offered to swap their shares
for shares in HoldCo (and HoldCo will become the
only member of each of
Association and Insurance). The offer by HoldCo to members of Association and
Insurance will enable members
to either:
<P>

(a)	be allotted shares in HoldCo; or
<P>

(b)	renounce their right to take the shares and receive cash instead (this cash
coming from the institutional tender referred to
in our previous Brief).
<P>

2.	Members of Association and Insurance will be allotted shares in HoldCo and
on allotment (or some other date) shall cease to be
members of Association and
Insurance. The other possible dates may be:
<P>

(a)	the date on which shares are issued by Association and Insurance to HoldCo;
or
<P>

(b)	some other date such as the date the resolutions of members takes
effect.
<P>

In both cases the resolutions may include a resolution approving the payment of
a dividend by each of Association and Insurance
to their members, which
dividend would be applied by each company to pay up fully the shares to be
allotted to members. Senior Counsel
may assume that if any Corporations Law
approvals are required for this purpose, such approvals will be obtained.
Senior Counsel
may also assume that the resolutions amending the articles of
each of Association and Insurance will provide for the transfer of
shares in
Association and Insurance from members to HoldCo referred to below."
<P>

463	The replacement brief more closely reflected the alternatives still under
consideration.
<P>

464	Going only to the replacement brief, although in these respects there was
no material difference, after the description of the
proposal it immediately
stated -
<P>

"<b>1.  THE SPECIFIC QUESTION</b>
<P>

The question is therefore whether HoldCo can, in effect, force an allotment of
shares by providing that all members of Association
and Insurance who do not
respond to the HoldCo offer shall have HoldCo shares allotted to them."
<P>

465	The observations in the brief then dealt with "Relevant legal
considerations" and "Application of the above considerations to
the NRMA case".
The legal considerations were of contractual matters to do with consensus and
silence as acceptance.  The discussion
of application of the considerations
included -
<P>

"<b>(b)	Schemes of arrangement and compulsory acquisition - </b>
<P>

<b>	can we draw an analogy?</b>
<P>

We have given consideration as to whether an analogy can be drawn between
`forcing' shares in HoldCo on members and cases where
a scheme of arrangement
is undertaken whereby shareholders in one company become shareholders in a new
company or where shareholders
in a company have their shares acquired
compulsorily under stipulated procedures.
<P>

A recent example of the latter was the decision of the New South Wales Court of
Appeal in <i>WCP Ltd v Gambotto</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 385</a> which, in essence,
emphasised that the terms upon which the shares in that case were being
acquired compulsorily must be `fair'.
<P>

The difficulty in drawing any analogy between these cases and our situation it
[sic] that, of course, both a scheme of arrangement
and the compulsory
acquisition provisions are specifically blessed by statute. The analogy is
therefore not a strong one.
<P>

The reason for raising the issue is that whether or not it is possible to draw
together various streams of authority which would
enable the conclusion to be
reached that the `package' being offered to members is fair and that there is
no valid reason to disallow,
in the special circumstances that the NRMA case, a
provision which requires non-responding members to be allotted shares [sic]. It
is integral to the proposals that each member receives something."
<P>

466	After a summary of arguments, the brief asked Mr Heydon "to advise on the
question referred to in paragraph 1 above".  There
was an addendum to the
replacement brief, on a separate page, which suggested a mechanism for the
"default" position being shares
rather than cash.
<P>

<b>The conference of 7 March 1994</b>
<P>

467	A conference with Mr Heydon was appointed for 7 March 1994.
Mr Bateman and Ms Godwin were informed.  Present with Mr Heydon
at
the conference were Mr Morgan, Mr Simpson and Mr Bateman.  Again the evidence
of what occurred at the conference was incomplete,
and there were divergent
recollections.  There was a particular conflict over whether something was said
at the conference about
free shares.  
<P>

468	Mr Heydon had little recollection of the conference.  His notes, partly of
preparation for the conference, were of Delphic obscurity,
it seems even to Mr
Heydon by the time these proceedings brought resort to them.  They did indicate
concentration on s 180(3) of
the Law, a provision by which a member of a
company was not bound by certain alterations to the constitution of a company
made after
he became a member unless he agreed to it in writing.  One of Mr
Heydon's notes for or of the conference, a note of a matter which
he did not
recall being discussed but which "occurred to his mind", was "why can't he say
I just want to stay a member of Association
and Insurance".  According to Mr
Heydon, he was not asked for and did not express any opinion concerning
oppression on the occasion,
and there was no request for a written opinion on
the question in the brief.
<P>

469	Mr Morgan's notes of the conference, beyond which he had no real
recollection, were also rather obscure, but indicated that
there was fairly
extensive discussion involving s 180(3) of the Law, the use of a trustee,
changing articles, and a scheme of arrangement.
 Mr Morgan agreed that no
advice was given by Mr Heydon in relation to oppression, and to the best of his
recollection there was
no reference in the conference to <i>Gambotto's
case</i>.  In his evidence Mr Morgan said that he thought that his view at the
time was that it was not possible to make a member a shareholder
in the holding
company without the member's agreement, that Mr Heydon agreed, and that there
was some discussion of using a trust
or a scheme of arrangement to overcome
that difficulty.  He had no other significant recollection.  If Mr Morgan did
think at the
time that it was not possible to make a member a shareholder in
the holding company without the members' agreement, his view had
been modified
since early in February 1994.  Maybe it had - the arguments described in the
brief went in both directions, and the
brief did not put forward an AAH
view.
<P>

470	Putting aside the free shares matter, Mr Simpson also had no recollection
of the conference beyond his notes, but he had the
most extensive notes.  They
indicated discussion of s 180(3) of the Law, and that a scheme of arrangement
came up as one of three
possible ways of forcing an allotment of shares on a
non responding member, the other ways being amendment of the articles and use
of a trust.  The notes tended to confirm that Mr Heydon advised that compulsory
shareholding could not be achieved simply by amendment
of the articles, but
that the other ways could be available.  They did not suggest any reference to
oppression, and Mr Simpson did
not recall any such reference.  At the close of
the notes was "Brief Dyson on options we've discussed", suggesting that the
opinions
expressed were subject to further consideration.  Mr Simpson had no
recollection of reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.
<P>

471	According to Mr Bateman, Mr Heydon "substantially agreed with the viewpoint
I expressed on 11 February 1994".  Mr Bateman's
recollection was that there was
a discussion about conferring shares in the holding company upon people who
were not members of either
Association or Insurance, the matter being raised by
Mr Morgan, and that Mr Heydon expressed the view that a scheme of arrangement
was a possible way of doing so but that it would be desirable that the
conferral of the shares be restricted to those people who
were members of
either Association or Insurance.  Prior agreement to becoming a shareholder was
unnecessary where a scheme of arrangement
was used.  This was supported by Mr
Bateman's notes of the conference.  They recorded a time for the conference and
-
<P>

"-	s 180(3) discussed
<P>

-	scheme of arrangement is a possibility
<P>

-	fallback cannot be allotment of shares
<P>

- 	     "     of allotment to trustee who holds shares in trust pending
instruction is OK"
<P>

To the best of Mr Bateman's recollection there was no reference to oppression
or <i>Gambotto's case</i> during the conference.  
<P>

472	Some guidance from what happened after the conference might be expected,
but there was little guidance from the evidence.  A
BT file note of 8 March
1994, author unclear, apparently recording what was said at a meeting with
Messrs Morgan and Simpson, included
"<u>Haydon</u> [sic] bottom line can't just
force shares on members", that "other ways of doing it" were discussed, and
that "putting a trust on
top" was acceptable.  The meaning of other things in
the file note is obscure.  File notes apparently written by Ms Birch of
meetings
on 10 March 1994, one with Mr Morgan, refer to relinquishment of
entitlement to get shares, scheme of arrangement, and the need to
see Mr Heydon
again "with firm proposal and specific steps", but the notes were not explained
or investigated in the evidence and
I do not think any significance could
safely be attributed to them.  Mr Bateman's notes of a meeting on 15 March
1994, it seems a
meeting of substance because attended by Mr Willing, Mr Rees,
Mr Burnstein, Mr Pearce, Ms Conway, Mr Ross, Mr Barry, Mr Stern, and
Mr Morgan,
included, "Share default is preferred position.  Those shares should be held by
a trust.  After 6-12 months those shares
are sold and cash distributed.  Peter
Barry will do share trust concept."  There was otherwise no highlighting of the
question of
non-responding members in the period after 7 March 1994.  
<P>

473	With further development of the proposal, the shares in Holdings offered to
non-responding members fell into the NRMA Offer
Trust.  The share default was a
default to the Trust, and it may be that there was discussion of a trust on 7
March 1994 as a means
of forcing shares on members in the sense that the shares
would be held for a time but then, if the member did not make a late choice,
would be sold, so that the member would receive cash.  This may have been the
point of the last of Mr Bateman's notes, with the trust
there referred to
becoming the NRMA Offer Trust.  It must have been accepted that the allotment
of shares could not be forced on
non-responding members, and that they would in
due course receive cash.  
<P>

474	I see no reason to conclude, as the NRMA seemed to suggest should be
concluded, that the undoubted reference to a scheme of
arrangement in the
conference was in the context of scheme or meeting of December 1993, or
involved revisiting Mr Heydon's opinion
of 20 December 1993.  There was clearly
enough quite extensive discussion of the particular question on which Mr Heydon
had been
asked to advise.  That question was whether HoldCo could force its
shares on non-responding members, more precisely whether the offer
by HoldCo to
members or allotments to members could result in allotment to the
non-responding members.  It was not whether resolutions
of Association or
Insurance could have that result.  
<P>

475	From the notes of the conference it may be that the discussion ranged more
widely, and included using a scheme of arrangement
to bind non-responding
members, but the context was quite different from that of changing the status
of Association and Insurance
by turning members of a company limited by
guarantee into shareholders in the holding company.  If it was implicit in Mr
Heydon's
advice that non-responding members could not be obliged to become
shareholders in HoldCo pursuant to resolutions of Association or
Insurance, but
that they could be so obliged pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (although it
is not easy to come to this conclusion
on the state of the evidence), that was
not expropriation of shares but the reverse, and <i>Gambotto's case</i> was not
relevant.  There was no reason to give advice about <i>Gambotto's case </i>or
oppression, and it was not given.
<P>

476	The particular conflict over whether something was said at the conference
about free shares was distinct from the question of
non-responding members.
<P>

477	In his witness statement dated 28 April 1997 Mr Simpson said that in early
March 1994 he had a conversation with Mr Morgan,
in which Mr Morgan said, "We
need to look at whether the shares can be called `free'.  I think it's probably
okay because although
members are giving up their rights in Association and
Insurance, they won't have to pay for the shares."  Mr Simpson agreed.  He
said
that he had given consideration at this time to whether the shares could be
called free shares if there was to be no cash payment
for them, seeing an issue
of whether this would contravene s 52 of the TP Act and s 995 of the Law as
being misleading because, even
though members would not be paying for the
shares, the fact that they were giving up a right, namely membership of
Association or
Insurance, meant that the shares in the holding company could
not be described a free.  He formed the view that the description could
be used
and was not misleading.  
<P>

478	In the same witness statement Mr Simpson said that he recalled attending a
meeting in Mr Heydon's chambers with Mr Heydon, Mr
Morgan, and Mr Bateman,
which on his best recollection was prior to 17 March 1994 but possibly not
until around June 1994, and that
there was an exchange concerning free shares.
Either Mr Morgan or Mr Bateman, probably Mr Morgan, said, "We would like to use
the
expression `free' to describe the shares because members are not paying for
the shares.  Do you think that's all right, given that
although they are not
paying for them the members are also giving up a right? Can we say the shares
are free even though members
are giving something up?"  Mr Heydon replied, "I
think it is all right.  Even though members are giving up something, they are
still
not paying for the shares.  I think that's okay".  
<P>

479	In his oral evidence Mr Simpson fixed the exchange at 7 March 1994, saying
that he had residual doubt but "felt at the meeting
on 7 March we discussed the
use of the word `free' because at that time what I call the communications
people had said that they
were getting positive feedback from the use of that
word".  
<P>

480	Mr Morgan neither supported nor denied this exchange.  He gave evidence of
his consideration of whether the proposed shares
in the holding company could
be described as free, and of his conclusion that they could.  The primary
reason for his conclusion
was that the everyday meaning of `free' was `at no
cost', in the sense that there was no need to pay any money, and that that was
how the word would be understood by members receiving material sent to them.  A
secondary reason, he said, was that, provided there
was separate provision for
continued road service and other membership services, minimal if any value
could be ascribed to membership
of Association and Insurance, so that very
little if anything of value was to be exchanged for the shares - exchanged by
the individual
members, although the memberships might have value together in
the hands of the one entity.  The rights given by membership were
not saleable,
and it was highly doubtful that a dividend could be declared.  
<P>

481	According to Mr Morgan, he discussed his conclusion with Mr Ian Tonking, a
partner at AAH specialising in trade practices matters,
and Mr Tonking agreed
with him;  he also discussed it with Mr Simpson, and he and Mr Simpson were in
agreement.  If this be so, it
is understandable that Mr Morgan might have asked
Mr Heydon for his view at the conference on 7 March 1994, but if he had done so
some recollection of the occasion would be expected when Mr Morgan had a
recollection of discussing his view with Mr Tonking and
Mr Simpson.  
<P>

482	Mr Bateman said that to his recollection no one at the conference asked
about the use of the expression "free shares".  He later
said that he thought
any such exchange as Mr Simpson recalled would have stuck in his mind, because
it would have been inconsistent
with the proposal as it then stood involving
payment of dividends.
<P>

483	Mr Heydon denied the exchange, saying that apart from advice concerning the
onsert in early August 1994 (see later in these
reasons) he was never asked
whether it was all right to use the expression "free shares", and that he never
said that it was.  
<P>

484	In resolving this conflict, some further matters should be taken into
account.
<P>

485	First, according to Mr Morgan, at a meeting which he initially put in late
January/early February 1994 but later said was more
probably in March 1994,
probably a communications meeting, Mr Barrett asked him whether there were any
difficulties with the use
of the word `free' to describe the shares, saying
that the message conveyed to members had to be simple and that one reason it
was
necessary to use the word `free' was so that members understood that they
did not have to send any money in to obtain the shares.
 Mr Morgan said that he
replied that it was acceptable to use the word `free' so long as it was
explained in the prospectus that
members were giving up their rights in
Association and Insurance in return for the shares, and that Mr Bateman, also
at the meeting,
expressed his agreement.  This is consistent with Mr Morgan's
evidence, but difficult to reconcile with the stance of AAH in the
first
quarter of 1994, described when I come to external communications a little
later in these reasons, by which the "no cost" message
was acceptable only if
in terms of intention that the shares be free.  Explanation of giving up rights
was no part of AAH's then
stance.  The AAH stance casts doubt on Mr Morgan's
recollection not only of the exchange with Mr Barrett, but also of his raising
free shares with Mr Heydon.
<P>

486	Secondly, as at 7 March 1994 members were paying for the shares, at least
by swap of shares in Association or Insurance or by
payment of par value, and
even though a dividend might have been declared which could be applied to pay
the shares up in full there
was in a real sense payment.  There was no payment
in the sense of no large cash outlay, but if there was concern over giving up
membership rights there would have to have been concern over the swap, the
payment of par value, or the dividends.  It would be odd
if Mr Morgan had not
said that members were in a way paying for the shares, and odd if Mr Heydon,
with the knowledge of the proposal
from the replacement brief, had in his reply
not adverted to the swap or to payment of par value, and to the dividends.
<P>

487	In short, an exchange as recalled by Mr Simpson is out of step with the
circumstances at the time.  Mr Simpson's recollection
was not firm, and he
agreed that the extent of his recollection was that Mr Heydon had said that the
shares were capable of being
described as free, but no more, and that whether
that description was misleading or inaccurate depended on the context.  That is
quite a different thing from the exchange as first recounted by Mr Simpson, and
consistent with AAH's concern at the time (in the
context of the external
communications) over the "no cost" message.  It meant little, and because it
meant little may have been the
effect of a passing remark at the conference
which no one else remembered.  When Mr Morgan did not support it, Mr Bateman
was rather
against it, and Mr Heydon denied it, I am not satisfied that there
was an exchange of the more positive kind first recounted by Mr
Simpson.  
<P>

<b>Development of the proposal to presentation to the boards</b>
<P>

488	On 8 March 1994 Mr Morgan faxed to Mr Rees a summary of the proposal as it
then stood.  The heading to the fax was simply "Structure".
 
<P>

489	The first paragraph recorded the principal objectives to be achieved in the
restructuring, said to be in no particular order
-
<P>

"(a)	A new holding company with a flat structure beneath it.
<P>

(b)	Entitlements as defined by Phil Stern.
<P>

(c)	No cash to be required from members;  share subscriptions to be funded by
dividend or other means.
<P>

(d)	Shares in the hands of members to be post CGT assets with cost base equal
to the net asset value per share of Association and
Insurance.
<P>

(e)	Shareholding preferred as the outcome in default of member election, rather
than cash.
<P>

(f)	Simplicity.
<P>

(g)	Completion within contemplated timetable (which suggests a need to avoid
putting to Government request which raised general
policy issues requiring wide
consultation)."
<P>

490	It is to be noted that these were objectives:  it did not follow that the
proposal met them.  Objective (c), no cash to be required
from members, still
contemplated payment for the shares, although funded in some way.  Objective
(e), addressing non-responding members,
was a preferred outcome, but what
followed showed that, presumably as a result of the conference with Mr Heydon,
it was in doubt.
 
<P>

491	The fax suggested three alternative structures.  
<P>

492	The first structure was described as the "Base HoldCo Structure".  Members
would be invited to subscribe, according to entitlements,
for shares in HoldCo
"which will be paid to a relatively nominal amount".  HoldCo would take up
shares in each of Association and
Insurance.  Members of Association and
Insurance would cease to be members.  If the subscription for HoldCo shares
could be funded
by dividend, that met all the objectives, subject to two
matters.  One was that "the extent to which shares can be achieved as a
default
option is limited;  the use of a trust can extend the time within which the
elections can be solicited from members":  this
was clearly enough a reference
to forcing shares on non-responding members.  
<P>

493	The second was that legislative relief was necessary in order to have a
satisfactory tax outcome.  The other structure was described
as the "HoldCo
Takeover Structure".  Association and Insurance would issue shares to members
in a demutualising transaction, with
legislation to produce the desired tax
outcome.  Those shares would then be exchanged for shares to be issued by
HoldCo as consideration
for HoldCo's acquisition of the shares.  
<P>

494	The third structure was described as the "Association as HoldCo Structure".
Association would issue shares to members according
to entitlements.  It would
take up shares in Insurance, and the other members of Insurance would cease to
be members.  There would
be no allotment or acquisition of shares by a new
holding company, and Association would be the holding company.  
<P>

495	A number of disadvantages in the second and third alternatives were set
out, and it was recommended that the first alternative
put to government, no
doubt in connection with legislation for taxation relief, be the Base HoldCo
Structure. 
<P>

496	There was then a new development, for the purposes of these proceedings and
with hindsight a significant development in relation
to the free shares
question.  
<P>

497	Following a discussion between Mr Rees, Mr Barry, and Mr Morgan on 9 March
1994, on that day Mr Barry sent to Mr Morgan a note
of a "model" according to
which there would be no need for a dividend.  The model expressly assumed that
members "have an existing
entitlement in Association and Insurance".  It
proceeded by the steps of establishment of HoldCo, agreement by members to
transfer
their entitlement in Association and Insurance to HoldCo in
consideration for the issue of HoldCo shares and conditionally on the
conversion of Association and Insurance to companies limited by shares and
guarantee, and the allotment of the shares in HoldCo.
 The features of the
model were said to include that, since the consideration for the issue of
shares in HoldCo was the transfer
of members' existing entitlements, a cash
payment by members equal to the par value of the shares in HoldCo would not be
required.
 Therefore no cash distribution to members would be required from
Association and Insurance to fund the par value payment, no bonus
issue to
increase shareholdings would be required, and a number of taxation difficulties
would be overcome.  It was noted that the
capital structure of HoldCo would
comprise shares issued at an optimal par level and a premium, in aggregate
equal to the value of
members' entitlements.
<P>

498	This model was also taken up  by Mr Morgan in a fax dated 9 March 1994 to
Messrs Willing and Rees, copied to Ms Godwin and Mr
Barry.  The fax included
-
<P>

"This morning, we discussed with Peter Barry a variation on the `HoldCo
Takeover Structure' outlined in paragraph 4 of yesterday's
facsimile.  The
variation is that Association and Insurance do not issue shares to their
respective members but rather, following
the approval of members in General
Meeting, the members agree to swap <u>their entitlement to take up shares</u>
in Association and Insurance for shares in the Holding Company.  The shares in
the Holding Company would be issued in consideration
of members giving up their
rights and would therefore be fully paid up.  There would be no need for a
dividend to fund the par value
of the shares.  This makes this option very
attractive from the point-of-view of providing a simpler proposal to
members.
<P>

The value of the rights of a member to take up shares following a members'
meeting ought not be different from the value of the
shares which would
otherwise have been listed by Insurance or Association.
<P>

To satisfy its obligation, HoldCo would issue shares with a par value of say $1
and with a premium in respect of that part of the
value which exceeds $1.  The
premium would be transferred to a share premium account and would be subject to
the restrictions applied
to the use of moneys in a share premium account.
Further, this appears to be a small penalty to pay for the added
simplicity."
<P>

499	The key development was that no payment of subscription moneys for the
shares in the holding company would be required of members,
even payment funded
by a dividend or in some other manner from the NRMA's wealth.  The shares in
the holding company would be free
in the sense that not even funded cash would
be paid, although they would not be free in the sense that the members would
give something
up, their entitlements, in exchange for the shares.  There was a
difference between Mr Barry and Mr Morgan upon what would be given
up.  Mr
Barry referred simply to members' existing entitlements, it seems having in
mind some kind of rights to share in the NRMA's
wealth.  Mr Morgan referred to
members' entitlements to take up shares in Association and Insurance, a
different thing and something
which would not exist until Association and
Insurance became companies limited by shares and by guarantee and the members
were given
entitlements to take up shares in them.  Neither Mr Barry nor Mr
Morgan seems to have had in mind members' rights as identified in
the Federal
Court proceedings, although Mr Barry was closer to that than Mr Morgan.  
<P>

500	Returning briefly to the conference of 7 March 1994, if Mr Morgan were
thinking of members' rights, would he not have taken
them as or as part of the
rights the members were giving up?  And as earlier noted, not until 9 March
1994 could it really be said
that there might be no payment for the shares.
<P>

501	This development in the way the proposal was to be put into effect does not
seem to have further progressed prior to the boards
approving the proposal on
17 March 1994, perhaps because time did not permit.  Further consideration had
been given to entitlements,
but as the board meetings came closer the intended
basis of entitlement was much as had been set out in the attachment to the
letter
of 31 January 1994.  Some very preliminary work had been done in
relation to the prospectus, to which I will come.  There is no doubt,
however,
that what was to go to the boards was still a restructuring in concept, subject
to further development of its detail.  
<P>

<b>External communications</b>
<P>

502	Considerable attention was given to the external communications in the
hearing of these proceedings, purportedly for the assistance
they gave on the
free shares question.  Particularly when there were the events of early August
1994 to which I will come, they may
not have all the significance attributed to
them.  
<P>

503	I have referred to Mr Barrett's memorandum of 24 January 1994 referring to
"share allocation at no cost", and to the correction
indicating that there
would be a cost.  Mr Barrett still wanted the message of shares at no cost, as
appears for example in a memorandum
from Mr Barrett to Mr Barry dated 22
February 1994 including, as a possible way of expressing "the entitlement
proposition", that
the shareholder would "receive an issue of NRMA shares at no
cost".  
<P>

504	The matter came up directly when, on 25 February 1994, Ms Suzanne Parker of
Rowland sent to AAH a draft media statement and
a draft of material for the
March/April issue of the Open Road, to be distributed after the announcement of
the proposal.  
<P>

505	The draft media statement included-
<P>

"Mr Don Mackay, President of the NRMA, said: `Members already own the
organisation. However, currently we are unable to distribute
the wealth of the
NRMA to these people.
<P>

`By giving shares to members, they would be able to participate in our current
and future financial success. The shares would cost
members nothing. We are
returning wealth to people, not raising money. ...'"
<P>

The draft media statement also<i> </i>had Mr Willing saying that "in order
to issue shares, the NRMA would have to become a public company listed on the
Australian Stock
Exchange. This would allow the creation of shares which could
be distributed to members<i>"</i>.  A little later it attributed to
Mr Mackay the statement, "The issuing of shares at no cost to members on
this scale would be unprecedented
in Australian corporate history".  
<P>

506	The draft material for The Open Road was in Mr Willing's column, and
included -
<P>

"The option being investigated is to make members into shareholders.  In this
way, each individual member would receive shares valued
at hundreds of
dollars.
<P>

Members already own the NRMA. However, they do not benefit in a direct
financial way from our tremendous success. By giving shares
at no cost to all
members, they would be able to participate in our current and future financial
success. The shares would have an
immediate capital value. They would also
entitle the shareholders, that is you the members, to receive as dividends part
of any future
profits the organisation may make."
<P>

507	Either Mr Simpson or Mr James Wood, another solicitor at AAH working on the
proposal with Mr Morgan, suggested a number of changes.
 They included
changing "giving" to "issuing<i>"</i> and deleting the sentence <i>"</i>The
shares would cost members nothing" in the first passage from the draft media
statement, changing "distributed" to "allocated"
in the second passage, and
deleting the third passage, and in the draft material for The Open Road
changing "receive" to "be allocated"
and deleting the following words, changing
"giving" to "issuing", and deleting the words "at no cost".  In a letter to
Ms Parker
dated 28 February 1994, Mr Simpson or Mr Wood made the
general comments -
<P>

"1.	It is not possible to adopt terms such as `giving away' of shares, `at no
cost' or `will cost members nothing'. As mentioned,
the precise details of the
allocation of shares to members have not been finalised.
<P>

2.	The estimated `value' of the shares to be distributed has not yet been
agreed. We do not think it is possible to include references
to those amounts
in this document. This includes references to `hundreds of dollars'."
<P>

508	This attention to giving shares to members at no cost in the media
statement and the Open Road was matched by attention to the
same language in a
question and answer script being prepared by Hogan, intended to be used by
telephone operators responding to enquiries
to a "NRMA share information
centre" operating from the announcement of the proposal.  
<P>

509	The Hogan draft as at 28 February 1994 included in the answer to the
question, "What is it all about?", that the NRMA had accumulated
wealth which
belonged to members but in which they could not share and, "By giving shares to
current members, with the shares costing
nothing, but having a capital value,
we would be returning the wealth to members.  The shares created would enable
everybody to gain
access to their share of the organisation's profits."  The
word "giving" was changed to a word which is indistinct in the copy in
evidence
but may have been "providing", the words "with the shares costing nothing" were
deleted, and there was written against this
part of the draft, "not technically
correct".  A number of other places in this script at which there was reference
to shares "at
no cost" had those words deleted.  
<P>

510	It is convenient to follow through each of these external communications.

<P>

511	The draft media statement seems to have been abandoned, and on 9 March 1994
Mr Greg Crowther of Rowland sent to Mr Morgan a
draft media release, clearly
enough based on the Open Road copy in its first draft form and attributing to
Mr Mackay reference to
"giving shares to all members".  Someone in AAH marked
the draft up by substituting "issuing" or "distribute" for "giving", and a
fax
from Mr Simpson to Mr Crowther dated 11 March 1994 (copied to Mr Rees and Ms
Godwin) containing AAH's comments included, "the
phrase `by giving shares' goes
too far.  It should either read `by issuing shares' or `by distributing
shares'."  
<P>

512	The fax was sent at 2.14 pm, but the subject must have come up at a meeting
at 2pm that day attended by NRMA personnel concerned
with public relations and
representatives of the marketing and public relations advisers, including Ms
Parker and Mr Crowther.  The
minutes of that meeting included -
<P>

"There is legal resistance to the `no cost' message being in the announcement
press release, although this question may be addressed
in  questions following
the announcement. The `no cost' message will be communicated in the
advertising. It was subsequently agreed
with Allens that the following wording
is acceptable: `<u>It is our intention that these shares be free</u>.'"
<P>

513	The legal resistance was exemplified by, and the subsequent agreement was
foreshadowed in, a discussion of which Mr Barrett
 gave evidence at some time
before the 3.30 meeting on 11 March 1994 to which I next refer.  The discussion
was with Mr Morgan and
perhaps Mr Simpson.  Mr Morgan explained that at that
time it was not certain that the shares could be issued at no cost or free,
because it might be necessary to require a dividend to be declared and for
members to apply the dividend in payment for the shares.
 The discussion turned
to other words which could be used, and Mr Morgan said that it would be all
right to use a phrase such as
"It is our intention that these shares be free".

<P>

514	The subsequent agreement was reached at the communications meeting at 3.30
pm on 11 March 1994.  Present at the meeting were
Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, Mr
Ross, Mr Barrett, Mr Morgan, Mr Bateman, and numerous others.  
<P>

515	Mr Bateman's note of the meeting included, apparently in connection
with announcement of the value of the shares members would
receive -
<P>

"<u>Intending</u> that members do not have to pay anything.
<P>

If follow up question comes - <u>minimal</u> cost"
<P>

516	Mr Bateman gave evidence of discussion at the meeting concerning reference
to the value of shares, and also concerning free
shares.  His evidence included
that Mr Morgan said -
<P>

"One of the issues we are still grappling with is how the shares are going to
be paid up.  As you know, we have been looking at
the possibility of dividends
being paid out by each of Association and Insurance, and the like.  We have
been discussing these matters
with Dyson Heydon.  At this stage we can't
guarantee that members will not have to pay anything.  We have to use the word
`intending'.
 In other words, we will be saying that `it is our intention that
members do not have to pay anything for the shares'.  That's as
far as we can
go at the moment."
<P>

Mr Bateman said that Mr Barrett asked why it couldn't just be said that the
shares were going to be free, and that Mr Morgan replied
that until it was
sorted out "we can really only say that we are intending that members don't
have to pay anything.  If a follow
up question comes from a journalist as to
what this means, the appropriate answer that Don Mackay should give is that the
shares
will be given at nominal cost".  This was then changed at Mr Barrett's
suggestion to "minimal cost".  
<P>

517	Mr Morgan did not recall saying these things, but he agreed that they
reflected his state of mind at the time, his notebook
for this meeting included
"Is our intention that the share be free", and I accept that he did say them.

<P>

518	The final version of the media statement was approved by AAH on 15 March
1994.  In that version, Mr Mackay referred to issuing
shares to members and to
members getting shares, Mr Willing referred to shares being distributed among
members, and there was attributed
to Mr Willing the statement "It is our
intention that these shares be free to members".  
<P>

519	Going to the question and answer script, the next draft dated 3 March 1994
referred to "issuing shares" or "receiving shares"
rather than "giving" shares
to members, although it still had one reference to the shares being at no cost.
The next draft dated
7 March 1994, apparently following a meeting between Ms
Godwin and Ms Vicki Hogan of Hogan, had no reference to shares at no cost,
and
was accompanied by a note from Ms Hogan stating "While we cannot say `no cost'
I draw your attention to page twenty and our scripted
answer".  The answer at
that page to the question "Will we have to pay for these shares?" included "No.
If you were a current member
on 16 March 1994 you will be eligible to receive
shares" and "Details are still being worked out, but the net affect [sic] is
expected
to be that you would not have to send any money".  
<P>

520	In another draft dated 9 March 1994 these answers to the question "Will we
have to pay for these shares?" remained.  The same
question and this part of
the answer appeared elsewhere in the script.  The draft went to AAH, and was
marked up with queries against
the two negative answers, in relation to the
first with the marginal note "Can't say shares are free".  The next draft dated
11 March
1994 reflected this, omitting the two words "No" but in both places
containing the words "It is expected that you will not have to
send any money
for the shares".  The final draft, dated 15 March 1994 and "signed off" by AAH
on that day, dealt with the first question
in the same way, but the question at
page 20 included in the answer "It is our intension [sic] that you will not
have to send any
money for the shares".
<P>

521	As to The Open Road, the next draft of the Open Road copy was sent to Mr
Wood on 2 March 1994.  It reflected the changes he
had suggested.  The copy
went through further drafts with comments which it is unnecessary to detail.
The Open Road copy was "signed
off" by AAH prior to publication.
<P>

522	Other external communications, such as the script for a media conference to
be held on the announcement of the proposal and
the text of the President's
message in the Open Road, referred to issuing shares to members and to the
intention that the shares
be free to members.  It is unnecessary to detail
them.  What is quite plain is that, as I have said, the marketing and public
relations
advisers wanted to convey the message of shares at no cost, but AAH
advised against that bald description although eventually considering
acceptable a description to the effect that the NRMA intended that members
would not have to send any money or intended that the
shares would be free to
members.  Mr Bateman acquiesced in that course.  
<P>

523	The "legal resistance to the `no cost' message" was, however, not because
it was perceived that the shares would be issued in
return for giving up
membership rights.  The reason for the resistance was initially that, as the
proposal was seen, members would
have to pay at least subscription moneys of
the par value of the shares, and later more, although the payments might be
funded in
some way out of the NRMA's wealth.  The modification to an intention
that the shares be free was because, with the new way of giving
effect to the
issue of the shares suggested on 9 March 1994, members might not have to pay
the subscription moneys or other moneys,
and so the NRMA's undoubted objective
that no cash be required from members (see Mr Morgan's fax of 8 March 1994)
could be reflected
in a statement of its intention.  
<P>

524	An intention that the shares be free, qualified as an intention because it
was then not certain that members would not have
to pay anything, carried with
it that the shares could be described as free once it was established that
members would not have to
pay anything.  Mr Morgan and Mr Simpson may well have
given thought to whether the fact that members would be giving up membership
rights would preclude or endanger this, even though I am not satisfied that it
was raised with Mr Heydon on 7 March 1994.  That thought
was given to the
matter is found not only in their evidence to which I have already referred,
but also in other evidence including
that of Mr Rees to which I next refer,
that of an exchange to which Mr Mackay was a party early in July 1994 to which
I refer much
later, and more generally the fact that in the drafting of the
prospectus there was reference to members giving up their membership
rights.

<P>

525	There was, however, divergence between Mr Bateman and others over whether
the possible significance of loss of membership rights
to describing the shares
as free was made known to the NRMA, with advice to the effect that the share
could be so described provided
there was disclosure of what the members were
giving up.
<P>

526	An occasion for the divergence was at about this time, although not
necessarily in connection with external communications.
 According to Mr Rees,
at what he described as a planning meeting shortly before 17 March 1994 Mr
Morgan said words to the effect,
"The word `free' implies that members are not
giving anything up to get the shares.  The fact is they are giving up their
rights
as members and we must be careful that we describe the position
accurately".  Still according to Mr Rees, Mr Bateman replied, "John,
I think
you are being overly technical.  As I understand the proposal at present NRMA
is contemplating a issue of shares to members
that involves no payment of
money.  The commonly understood meaning of the term `free' is that there is no
payment, and it seems
reasonable to me that in that situation NRMA can use the
word `free'.  In any case the rights of members are quite narrow.  They
receive
no financial benefit in the event of a winding up.  Their rights comprise
things like voting, attendance at meetings and
so on.  Even these rights are
limited in the sense that if a member fails to pay their annual membership fee
then these rights disappear.
 Provided these matters are properly disclosed in
the prospectus I think its okay to use the word `free'."  
<P>

527	Mr Morgan had no recollection of such an occasion.  Mr Bateman denied
saying what was attributed to him, and according to his
evidence apart from the
meeting on 11 March 1994 (he must have meant what was said about an intention
that the shares be free) Mr
Morgan did not in his presence say that the
description of free shares could be used.  
<P>

528	I do not see why I should put aside the evidence of Mr Morgan and Mr
Simpson of giving thought to the possible impact of loss
of membership rights
on describing the shares as free, though dependent on the resistance for other
reasons to the "no cost" message
being overcome.  Once there was a real
prospect that the members would not have to pay anything, it is understandable
that the matter
would emerge.  The response attributed to Mr Bateman by Mr Rees
was consistent with Mr Bateman's evidence of the view he took of
members'
rights.  Taking account also of, for example, the exchange to which Mr Mackay
was a party early in July 1994, there was
a body of evidence from different
sources supporting that there was raised with the NRMA the use of the
description of free shares
in conjunction with disclosure of what the members
were giving up, that the use was approved, and that Mr Bateman was a party to
what was said.  I accept the evidence of Mr Rees to which I have referred.  
<P>

<b>The proposal is approved by the boards</b>
<P>

529	At some time in early March 1994 it was decided to put the proposal before
the boards on the one day, 17 March 1994.  Mr Rees
attempted a draft of
resolutions for the boards, and Mr Bateman returned to his own draft and
revised it.  Mr Rees had also prepared
a draft of a report for the boards, and
circulated it to Mr Willing, Ms Conway, Mr Pearce, Ms Godwin and Mr Stern.  The
decision
to put the proposal before the boards on 17 March 1994 was not without
some wavering by Mr Willing, on the ground that the proposal
was insufficiently
firm because of uncertainty of the capital gains tax position.  
<P>

530	By this time, as might be expected, word of a possible demutualisation had
leaked out.  There were newspaper articles on 19
February 1994 to the effect
that the NRMA was considering demutualisation and listing.  The newspaper
reports included that the Motorists
Action Group ("MAG") (as to which see
later) was opposed to any such action.  
<P>

531	Mr Rees finalised his report to the boards in a document dated 8 March
1994.  The report addressed reasons for restructuring,
and did not go into
detail concerning alternative structures;  it did not deal at all with the
steps required to achieve a new structure,
and in particular with how shares in
the new holding company would be issued.  
<P>

532	The report recommended that the "Board of the NRMA Group approve further
detailed investigation into the implementation of a
restructuring of the NRMA
into a company limited by both shares and guarantee and listed on the
Australian Stock Exchange", the restructuring
to be conducted "in a way that
guarantees the unique features and traditions of the NRMA are preserved".  The
description of the
proposal was limited to "key aspects", being -
<P>

"2.1.2	Establishment of a listed holding company to control the major existing
operating companies (Association, Insurance, and
Life) as subsidiaries
(Appendix 2).
<P>

2.1.3	Offer members shares in the new company so that members can become
directly entitled to the wealth of the NRMA.  Entitlements
to shares would be
based on a formula reflecting length of membership (see Appendix 3).
<P>

2.1.4	A special provision would be enshrined in the Articles to provide for
continued advocacy and mutual type service activities.
<P>

2.1.5	The key concept of NRMA membership will continue, by allowing people to
join a `club' for the purposes of receiving the member
services currently
available.
<P>

2.1.6	The restructuring proposed would require changes in the Memorandum and
Articles of both the Association and the Insurance
company.  Thus the
restructuring would be implemented only upon approval by 75 per cent of the
members voting at a general meeting
of members to authorise the
restructuring."
<P>

The appendices did not materially flesh out the steps to achieve the new
structure.  Towards the end of the report there was reference
to other
solutions and options which had been considered, but at the level of overall
structure rather than in detail.
<P>

533	On 9 March 1994 Mr Rees circulated to all general managers of the NRMA a
copy of his proposed report to the boards, together
with other information
concerning the proposals, and at some time in the following week there was what
was referred to as an executive
conference at which the proposal was presented
at management level.  It is plain that at this time the proposal to demutualise
became
common knowledge, if it had not already been such, amongst the senior
executives of the NRMA, and it was probably widely spoken of.
 Indeed, a large
newspaper article on 12 March 1994 reported the demutualisation as a watershed
in the NRMA's history, putting arguments
for and against. 
<P>

534	The directors of Association were Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Ms Ralph, Ms Anna
Booth, Mr Mark Burrows, Mrs Maree Callaghan, Mr Douglass,
Mr Nicholas
Farr-Jones, Miss Fraser, Mr Jack, Dame Leonie Kramer, Mr Geoff Lawson, Ms
Singleton, Mr R Talbot, Dr Roger Vanderfield,
and Dr Ron Werner.  The directors
of Insurance were Mr Mackay, Mr Burrows, Mr Jack, Mr Kirby, Mrs Callaghan, Mr
Corrigan, Mr Douglass,
Mr Michael Easson, Mr Farr-Jones, Ms Singleton, and Mr
Willing.  There were five directors of Association who were not directors
of
Insurance (Ms Ralph, Miss Fraser, Mr Talbot, Dr Vanderfield and Dr Werner), and
three directors of Insurance who were not directors
of Association (Mr
Corrigan, Mr Easson, and Mr Willing).  The Board of Management and Insurance
Liaison Committee comprised Mr Mackay,
Mr Kirby, Ms Ralph, Ms Booth, Mr Cox, Mr
Jack, Dame Leonie Kramer, Dr Vanderfield, Dr Werner, and Mr Willing.  Not all
the directors
gave evidence in these proceedings - those not called were Miss
Fraser, Ms Singleton, Mr Talbot, Dr Vanderfield, and Mr Willing.
<P>

535	The directors of Association were elected by members, until 1993 annually
and thereafter biennially.  For some years there had
been "tickets" in the
elections, and Mrs Callaghan, Miss Fraser, Mr Lawson, Ms Singleton, and Mr
Talbot had been elected on the MAG
ticket.  Mrs Callaghan had ceased to be a
MAG adherent, but there remained two broad groupings on the NRMA boards, the
MAG directors
and the other directors (which is not to say  that the MAG
directors were unified or that other directors had been on the one ticket
or
were unified).  Mr Talbot was the most active in the MAG cause.
<P>

536	In the week prior to and on 17 March 1994 the members of the boards were
given "pre-briefings" on the proposal intended to be
put before the boards on
that day.  Recollections of the occasions were varied.  The pre-briefings seem
to have been given by Mr
Willing, with some involvement of Mr Mackay, but the
detail into which they went was not clear.  
<P>

537	Particular reference was made in the proceedings to the pre-briefing given
to Mr Talbot.  
<P>

538	A letter to Mr Talbot from Mr Mackay dated 11 March 1994 told him of a
meeting of Association convened for 1 pm on 17 March
1994, described the
meeting as "called to discuss a confidential matter", and informed him that a
pre-briefing had been arranged
for him at 12 noon on the same day.  Mr Talbot
telephoned Mr Mackay to ask why the meeting had been called, but Mr Mackay
declined
to say more on the ground that he did not want the matter discussed in
the media before the meeting.  On the evidence before me,
there were grounds
for Mr Mackay to fear that Mr Talbot would not respect the confidentiality of
the matter but would engage with
the media if he were told more.  
<P>

539	There was then a response from Mr Talbot dated 14 March 1994, written in a
manner which could be described as confrontational,
complaining of refusal to
inform him of the subject of the meeting.  It is difficult to accept that Mr
Talbot was unaware of the
proposal, or unaware that the meeting convened for 17
March 1994 would address the proposal, and in the conversation with Mr Mackay
Mr Talbot asked if the meeting was about the floating of Insurance - there had
earlier been media reports on that subject. The defendants
nonetheless placed
some significance on the time appointed for the pre-briefing.  
<P>

540	The significance last mentioned, which I will describe later in these
reasons, requires regard to the positions of Miss Fraser,
Mr Lawson, and Ms
Singleton.  
<P>

541	There was no evidence as to the pre-briefing afforded to Miss Fraser.  A
letter dated 11 March 1994 from Mr Mackay to Ms Singleton
invited her to a
pre-briefing arranged for 9.00am on 17 March 1994, prior to the meeting of the
board of Association at 1.00pm on
that day called "to discuss a confidential
matter".   Mr Lawson was overseas at the time, and Mr Mackay spoke to him and
then sent
a fax on 16 March 1994 telling him of the meeting, very broadly of
the proposal, and that the board would be asked "to approve management
in
investigating the proposal with a view to it being discussed at a board retreat
in May and the final discussion as to whether
or not to proceed being made not
later than August".  Mr Lawson indicated that he was in favour of the
resolution to investigate
the proposal.
<P>

542	There were three relevant meetings on 17 March 1994, one of the Board of
Management and Insurance Liaison Committee, one of
the board of Insurance , and
one of the board of Association.  The first two meetings were held
concurrently.
<P>

543	The Board of Management and Insurance Liaison Committee and the board of
Insurance met at 11.20am.  Present in their respective
capacities were
Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Ms Ralph, Ms Booth, Mr Corrigan, Mr Cox, Mr
Douglass, Mr Easson, Mr Farr-Jones, Mr Jack, Dame
Leonie Kramer, Ms Singleton,
Dr Werner, and Mr Willing, and in attendance were members of
management including Mr Pearce, Mr Rees,
and Ms Conway.  Mr Willing
presented a report on the proposal, it seems Mr Rees' document of 8 March
1994 together with further materials
by way of overhead slides and charts.  
<P>

544	The Board of Management and Insurance Liaison Committee resolved -
<P>

"<b>Proposal for Listing</b>
<P>

That the Board of Management recommends to the Board of NRMA Limited that
approval is given for management to proceed with the further
development of the
proposal for listing of the NRMA Group on the Australian Stock Exchange
(subject to members' approval) and that
management is authorised to do all
things necessary to progress that process.
<P>

That the Board of Management recommends to the Board of NRMA Limited that
approval be given for the formation of a company to be
called `NRMA Holdings
Limited' with the President, Deputy President, Chief Executive Officer, Group
Secretary and General Counsel
and Greg Bateman of Abbott Tout, Solicitors,
being the five (5) subscribers as to $1.00 each. Such approval would be given
on the
basis that:
<P>

(a)	subject to members' approval, NRMA Holdings Ltd is to be the vehicle
whereby the NRMA Group is listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange;
<P>

(b)	prior to such listing the subscribers undertake to procure that NRMA
Holdings Ltd will not trade without the prior approval
of the Board of
Directors of NRMA Ltd;
<P>

(c)	each of the subscribers will remain the only shareholders until such
listing is to be implemented; and
<P>

(d)	if such listing has not been implemented within 12 months, those
subscribers undertake to transfer the issued share capital
of NRMA Holdings Ltd
to the Association or as the Board of Directors of NRMA Ltd may direct.
<P>

<b>Advisers</b>
<P>

That the Board of Management recommends to the Board of NRMA Limited that the
advisers listed below be retained in connection with
the proposal for listing.
Each would be retained on the following basis:
<P>

(a)	each is to advise the Association, NRMA Insurance Ltd and NRMA Holdings
Ltd;
<P>

(b)	pending such listing, the fees of such advisers shall be borne by the
Association and NRMA Insurance Ltd as to 10% and 90% respectively;
<P>

(c)	upon a successful listing of NRMA Holdings Ltd, it shall reimburse the
Association and NRMA Insurance Ltd all such fees and
other costs associated
with such listing.
<P>

The advisers, their roles and basis of their fees are:
<P>

[Here the advisers and other information was set out.]
<P>

<b>Due Diligence Committee</b>
<P>

That the Board of Management recommends to the Board of Directors of NRMA
Limited that:
<P>

(a)	a Due Diligence Committee be established to plan and carry out the due
diligence necessary for the proposal;
<P>

(b)	The Due Diligence Committee comprise:
<P>

	(i)	the President;
<P>

	(ii)	the Chief Executive Officer;
<P>

	(iii)	a Partner of Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley;
<P>

	(iv)	a Partner of Abbott Tout
<P>

	(v)	a Partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand;
<P>

	(vi)	a Partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu;
<P>

	(vii)	an Executive Director of BT Corporate Finance Limited;
<P>

	(viii)	such other persons as the President or the Chief Executive Officer may
approve from time to time;
<P>

(a)	the President and the Chief Executive Officer may appoint alternates to
attend meetings of the Due Diligence Committee on their
behalf and may approve
other persons to attend such meetings as observers.
<P>

<b>Service Members</b>
<P>

That the Board of Management recommends to the Board of Directors of NRMA
Limited that, as from midnight on 17 March 1994, the handling
of
membership (new members, renewals of current memberships) be dealt with in the
manner set out in the document headed `Rules Relating
to Membership from
midnight on 17 March 1994' tabled at the meeting.
<P>

<b>Publication</b>
<P>

That the Board of Management recommends to the Board of NRMA Limited that
approval is given for a press statement to be made in
the form of that tabled
at the meeting and that the President and the Chief Executive Officer (and
persons specifically authorised
by either of them) deal with the media in
relation to the proposal."
<P>

545	The board of Insurance resolved in like terms, save that it resolved for
itself to give approval to management to proceed with
the further development
of the proposal, conveyed to the board of Association that it agreed that
approval should be given to the
formation of Holdings, and resolved for itself
to give approvals in relation to advisers, the due diligence committee and the
press
statement.  
<P>

546	The resolutions of the Board of Management and Insurance Liaison Committee
were unanimous;  the resolutions of the board of
Insurance were unanimous save
that Ms Singleton abstained.  It was noted that the directors would hold a
retreat on 7 and 8 May 1994
"to discuss further developments of the
investigations into the proposal".  The meetings concluded at 12.50 pm.
<P>

547	The board of Association met at 1.09pm.  Present were Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby,
Ms Ralph, Ms Booth, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Douglass, Mr
Farr-Jones, Miss Fraser, Mr
Jack, Dame Leonie Kramer, Ms Singleton, Mr Talbot, and Dr Werner, and in
attendance were Mr Willing and
other members of management as before.  Mr
Willing again presented a report on the proposal and further materials.  
<P>

548	Motions for resolutions in like terms to those of the morning meetings,
save that Association would resolve for itself to give
approvals to management
to proceed with the further development of the proposal and to form Holdings
and would resolve for itself
to give approval in relation to advisers, the due
diligence committee, and the press statement, were proposed.  Mr Talbot moved
and
Miss Fraser seconded that the motions be deferred until the next meeting.
The latter motion was put and declared lost.  Association
then resolved in
terms of the substantive motions.  Those in favour were Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Mr
Jack, Ms Booth, Dame Leonie Kramer,
Dr Werner, Mr Douglass, Mr Farr-Jones, Ms
Ralph, and Mrs Callaghan.  Ms Singleton and Miss Fraser abstained.  Mr Talbot
dissented,
and requested that his dissent be noted on the ground that he wanted
more time to consider the proposal.  It was noted that Mr Burrows,
Mr Lawson
and Dr Vanderfield had been contacted and had indicated to the President that
they supported the proposal.  The same note
concerning a retreat was made.  The
meeting concluded at 1.50pm.
<P>

549	To return to the significance of the time appointed for Mr Talbot's
pre-briefing, it will be seen that it was after the meetings
of the Board of
Management and Insurance Liaison Committee and of Insurance, and only a short
time before the meeting of Association.
 The elapsed time of the former
meetings was more than the elapsed time of the later meeting.  The case of some
of the defendants
included that the majority of the boards, led by or in
sympathy with Mr Mackay, had such antipathy towards MAG and in particular
towards Mr Talbot, or at the least were sufficiently concerned to impede the
opposition to the demutualisation which was expected
from MAG and Mr Talbot,
that the conclusion was enhanced that they would have proceeded with the
proposal even if they had received
the Gambotto advice which the NRMA said
should have been given.  Elements in this case, to which I will return later in
these reasons,
were that there was a deliberate withholding from Mr Talbot of
information concerning the proposal until just before the meeting
of
Association;  that the holding of a joint meeting of the Board of Management
and Insurance Liaison Committee and the board of
Insurance was unusual, if not
unprecedented, which it was;  that there was a calculated plan to have a
commitment of Association
to the proposal to the extent that the members of
Board of Management and Insurance Liaison Committee and the board of Insurance
had already assented to it before the meeting of Association;  that the
duration of the meeting of Association was insufficient for
proper assimilation
of the proposal;  and that the rejection of Mr Talbot's request for deferral
was inappropriate.  I note these
matters now to explain why I have referred to
events concerning the meetings on 17 March 1994 in the way I have, and without
comment.
 I will be recording in these reasons further events the defendants
said went to the same case.  
<P>

550	The proposal was officially announced at a media conference at 3 pm on 17
March 1994.  The media statement released at this
time, in the form previously
approved, relevantly referred to "issuing" and "distributing" shares, and
attributed to Mr Willing (amongst
other things) the statement "It is our
intention that these shares be free to members".  
<P>

<b>A new project organisation</b>
<P>

551	Mr Hosking was brought in at about this time.  He established contact
persons for various areas, such as members, media, and
government.  He also
established "groupings of key personnel" which by and large remained in place
for the rest of the Legal Status
Project.  Knowing the groups will assist in
what follows.
<P>

552	One was the core group, said to be responsible for the entire project.  The
members were to be Mr Willing, Mr Rees, Mr Pearce,
Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, Mr
Jacob Mamutil (a senior manager with the NRMA, legally qualified), Mr Stern,
and Mr Hosking.  It could be
seen as a successor to the steering committee.
Rather like the steering committee, it does not seem to have operated as
intended,
and at times coalesced with the general communications group.  
<P>

553	Another was the general communications group, readily enough seen as taking
up the earlier communications meetings.  Its members
were Mr Willing, Mr Rees,
Mr Pearce, Ms Conway, Ms O'Connor, Ms Godwin, Mr Mamutil, Ms Elizabeth Shaw (in
the communications area
within the NRMA), Mr Peter Worland (assistant general
manager, external relations), Mr Tony Hoban (a senior manager with the NRMA,
in
the communications area), Mr Hosking, Mr Ross, Mr Barry, Mr Stern, Mr Barrett,
Ms Hogan, Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman.  
<P>

554	Another was the due diligence working group.  Its members were Mr Rees, Mr
Pearce, Ms Conway, and Mr Baker (in the taxation
area within the NRMA).  
<P>

555	Another was the prospectus working group.  Its members were Ms Godwin, Mr
Hosking, Mr Barry, Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman.  
<P>

556	Another was the accounting working group, the members of which need not be
stated.  
<P>

557	Finally, there was the logistics working group.  Its members included Mr
Mamutil, Ms Karen Scroope (a project manager with the
NRMA, experienced in
computer-aided technology), Mrs Lisa Storrs (a corporate adviser, legally
qualified, within the NRMA's secretariat),
and Mr Hosking.
<P>

558	At the same time, that is, in early April 1994, Mr Rees decided that each
adviser to the NRMA should have a member of NRMA management
"responsible for
tracking the advisor's [sic] activities".  His designations included himself
for PJP and Rowland, Mr Pearce for
BT and the investigating accountant, and Ms
Conway for AAH and AT.
<P>

<b>The due diligence committee</b>
<P>

559	On 17 March 1994 the boards had resolved to establish a due diligence
committee, and the due diligence working group just mentioned
was concerned
with its functioning.  The due diligence committee itself first met on 22 April
1994.  Its members were Mr Mackay,
Mr Kirby, Dr Werner, Mr Willing, Mr Rees, Mr
Morgan, Mr Bateman, Mr Robert Lynn of C&amp;L, Mr Rick Hullah of Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu
("DTT"), and Mr Barry.  Mr Hullah was to act, and acted, as
returning officer for the general meetings.  In June 1994, following
the
appointment of J B Were Stockbroking Ltd ("Were") as stockbrokers for the
proposal, Mr Brad Rees of that organisation was appointed
to the committee.  On
18 July 1994, following the incorporation of Holdings, Mrs Callaghan and Mr
Jack were appointed to the committee.
<P>

560	The due diligence committee operated under the legal guidance of Mr Morgan,
and other solicitors from AAH played a significant
part in the conduct of the
due diligence process.  At an early time Mr Morgan provided a planning
memorandum and verification programme
for a due diligence process, a draft
(almost pro forma) due diligence report to go from the committee to the
proposed holding company,
and materiality guidelines.  
<P>

561	The materiality guidelines were intended to provide criteria for what was
material or not material to the due diligence process,
and were both
quantitative and qualitative.  They said that the legal concept of materiality
was "really driven by a consideration
of what may affect a decision of a
potential investor", and the qualitative guidelines included regard to breach
of legislative or
other requirements, to matters it would ordinarily be assumed
the readers of the prospectus would require inclusion of or comment
on, and
generally anything management "considered to be material in terms of the future
operations of the business".  As will be
seen, the NRMA's case in these
proceedings included that the materiality guidelines encompassed risk to the
implementation of the
proposal from the use of the notion of free shares.
<P>

562	For the purposes of these proceedings it is unnecessary to go into the due
diligence process in detail.  There was implemented
a procedure of interviews
and presentations by NRMA management to identify material matters, and a
careful procedure for verifying
the correctness of statements of fact,
including intention, in the prospectus.  The process included in the provision
of the so-called
sign-off letter from AAH and, as it happened, another sign-off
letter from AT, going to the legal integrity of the report of the
due diligence
committee to Holdings and of the prospectus.  There will be reference in what
follows to the prospectus and the onsert
going before the due diligence
committee as they were drafted, and there will be particular reference to the
sign-off letters from
AAH and AT material to the report of the due diligence
committee in August 1994 and to the prospectus itself. 
<P>

<b>Further development of the proposal</b>
<P>

563	The further work on the form of the restructuring seems to have been led by
Mr Morgan.  It took up the approach which had been
suggested on 9 March 1994 by
which no payment was required for the shares to be issued by the holding
company.
<P>

564	The early development can be seen in an AAH memorandum, probably internal,
of 24 March 1994.  It outlined three approaches and
opted for a preferred
approach - 
<P>

"<b>THE THREE APPROACHES</b>
<P>

<b><u>1.  Base HoldCo structure approach</u></b>
<P>

This approach merely involves HoldCo making an issue and upon that issue being
made the status of Association and Insurance changes,
members cease to be
members and Association and Insurance issue shares to HoldCo.  There is no
explicit link between the expiry or
giving up of membership rights in Insurance
and Association with the issue of the shares.
<P>

<b>Issues for base structure</b>
<P>

The base structure satisfies all significant requirements other than the
requirement in relation to the paid up capital in that
a dividend would have to
be provided to the members for the purposes of paying up capital.  This
statement assumes the tax relief
sought is granted.
<P>

<b><u>2.  The HoldCo takeover structure approach</u></b>
<P>

As originally proposed this involved a swap of shares issued in Association and
Insurance for shares in HoldCo.  This has been developed
to be a swap of an
entitlement for shares in Association and Insurance for shares in HoldCo just
to avoid the necessity of issuing
shares out of Association and Insurance.  In
this case the paid value for the shares for HoldCo would be in effect the value
of the
group which is transferred to HoldCo in consideration of the issue of
the shares out of HoldCo.  Subject to the relevant tax relief
being granted,
this solves the problems other than the problem of locking in members to the
arrangement by a resolution.  It may
be necessary also to re-visit the way in
which entitlements are dealt with having regard to whether or not as part of
step 1 members
entitlements in Insurance are swapped to HoldCo or whether, in
effect, initially Insurance becomes a subsidiary of Association and
then is
subsequently transferred to HoldCo.
<P>

<b><u>3.  Association as HoldCo</u></b>
<P>

This proposal involves Association being the holding company and aims at
overcoming the Corporations Law problem of agreement being
required for a
person to become a member of a company.  As all persons who will be entitled to
entitlements are members of Association,
in effect the shares can be allotted
to them without any further agreement.  The only issue is how are the shares
paid up and for
that purpose a dividend would need to be paid which would
create a tax liability for some members.
<P>

<b>PREFERRED APPROACH</b>
<P>

The approach which seems to provide the best solution and is most consistent
with the announcements which have been made is the
second approach, the HoldCo
takeover approach.  The question then arises, how is that to be achieved.  To
answer that question we
need to analyse carefully the formula to be used for
the proposed resolutions to be put to members at the meetings of Association
and Insurance and to analyse the nature of the HoldCo offer/invitation.  We
suggest the resolutions should be as follows:
<P>

(a)	the members resolve that each company change status to companies limited by
shares and guarantee;
<P>

(b)	the members resolve that in consideration of HoldCo making the invitation
contained in the prospectus (invitation is used advisedly)
the members agree
that the articles be amended so that each member ceases to be a member and that
a share or shares in Association
and Insurance are transferred to HoldCo and in
consideration of the issue of that share to HoldCo the value of that share over
the
subscription monies subscribed by HoldCo be applied to pay up the shares
issued by HoldCo pursuant to its offer.  In consideration
of the foregoing
Association and Insurance agree to issue a share paid up to $1 for $1 to
HoldCo.  That resolution of Association/Insurance
would bind all members if
passed by the requisite 75% majority."
<P>

565	The Base HoldCo structure had earlier been preferred, but was now
supplanted by a modified version of the earlier HoldCo Takeover
Structure -
modified to reflect the ideas of 9 March 1994, in that the members'
entitlements to shares in Association and Insurance
were exchanged for shares
in the holding company.  This was not quite the same as the idea of 9 March
1994, but did avoid subscription
moneys and payment of a dividend.  According
to the second suggested resolution, although not clearly, the member's
entitlements
to shares became something rather different, indeed rather fell
away, and the shares to be issued by HoldCo would be issued fully
paid in
return for the members ceasing to be members and agreeing to the issue by
Association and Insurance of shares to the holding
company.  Mr Morgan seems to
have thought that this resolution would solve what he described as "the problem
of locking in members
to the arrangement by a resolution", that is, the
question of non-responding members, but there was something of a shift from the
HoldCo takeover structure as described.
<P>

566	In early April 1994 Mr Morgan prepared a more detailed paper, clearly
enough based on this memorandum, which went to the NRMA
and Mr Bateman.  Its
purpose was to identify the key requirements of the proposed restructuring and
to test those requirements against
alternative structures.  
<P>

567	One of the key requirements was that the paid up capital for the shares in
the holding company was not subscribed directly by
members or provided by way
of dividend;  another was that the members of Association and Insurance were
bound to the restructuring
by the resolutions passed at their general meetings,
and that neither some other agreement nor a scheme of arrangement was required.
Two models were proposed, one being the HoldCo takeover structure and the other
being the Association as HoldCo structure from the
earlier memorandum.  The
first was preferred as meeting more of the key requirements, but subject to
legislated tax relief to avoid
adverse capital gains tax.  The second was
rejected because, amongst other reasons, it was not clear that the allotment of
shares
could be achieved without a dividend to members of Association.  
<P>

568	The steps in the HoldCo takeover structure were described in the summary of
the model -
<P>

"(a)	HoldCo offers shares to members of Association capable of acceptance by
return of an acceptance form;  the shares of members
who reject the offer or do
not respond are allotted to a default trust which makes a secondary issue.
<P>

(b)	The offer is conditional on HoldCo becoming a member of Association and
Insurance and on the members of Association and Insurance
resolving to change
status to companies limited by shares and by guarantee and otherwise alter the
memorandum and articles to provide
that on a winding-up the property is
distributed to members and that on allotment of the shares offered by HoldCo
all members other
than HoldCo cease to be members of Association or Insurance.

<P>

(c)	Members of Association and Insurance approve in general meeting resolutions
as in (b)."
<P>

569	In the commentary on the model Mr Morgan wrote - 
<P>

"If the resolutions are structured as set out above, there should be no
dividend to members because the HoldCo shares they receive
are not distributed
to them (or procured to be distributed to them) by Association or Insurance;
rather they receive those shares
as a consequence of their ceasing to be
members of Association and Insurance. In other words, they receive the shares
in exchange
for something they relinquish (hence the need for legislative
exclusion of that disposal from the normal CGT provisions)."
<P>

570	The former idea of exchange of the members' entitlements to shares in
Association and Insurance, difficult to find in the resolutions
in the earlier
memorandum, has now gone, and the consideration for the HoldCo shares is
expressly members giving up their memberships.
 In a practical sense, of
course, giving up membership so that HoldCo is the only (shareholding) member
means that HoldCo through
its shareholding has all the NRMA's wealth.  Mr
Bateman concisely summarised the matter in a file note dated 7 April 1994 -
<P>

"	idea he presently favours is
<P>

(a)	HoldCo becomes member of each of Association and Insurance
<P>

(b)	insert Articles in each of Ass &amp; Ins' Articles expelling members,
except for HoldCo
<P>

(c)	this is in consideration of HoldCo issuing shares to expelled members".
<P>

571	It will be seen that there was still room for the doubts expressed by Mr
Bateman in December 1993 giving rise to the question
of scheme or meeting.  The
articles of Association and Insurance would be changed by members' resolutions
inter alia to provide that
all members other than HoldCo would cease to be
members.  This may have been behind Mr Bateman's use of the words "expelling"
and
"expelled" in his file note.  What the developed proposal brought more to
the fore, however, was the nature of the consideration
for the HoldCo shares.
No longer was it money, even if funded to members.  It was something more
abstract, not of fixed value, possibly
not capable of valuation.  That was seen
as raising a capital gains tax problem (harking back to the earlier papers of
Mr Magid),
whether termination of membership was giving up property and what
the value of the property was.  
<P>

572	It was also seen as raising a corporations law problem, expressed (perhaps
obscurely) in Mr Morgan's paper as -
<P>

"Conceptual difficulty in providing that the HoldCo shares are paid-up from the
value of the NRMA Group transferred to HoldCo (as
a result of HoldCo being the
only member of Association and Insurance).  Consideration must be a
consideration recognised by the
law.  This appears to be satisfied but is to be
verified with Senior Counsel."
<P>

This second matter led to a further brief to Mr Heydon.
<P>

573	That the members were seen as giving something up in return for their
shares was, however, not in doubt by this time.  Three
illustrations from the
period after 7 April 1994 are sufficient.
<P>

574	One is a letter from Mr Bateman to Mr Pearce dated 28 April
1994 concerning the treatment of goodwill when valuing the NRMA.
Mr Bateman's recital of the background included -
<P>

"<b>Restructuring</b>
<P>

1.2	The proposed restructuring of the NRMA Group, if approved by the members of
each of the Association and Insurance would, in
effect, involve the following
steps:
<P>

(a)	NRMA Holdings Limited would become a member of each of the Association and
Insurance;
<P>

(b)	each of the Association and Insurance would convert to a company limited by
guarantee and shares;
<P>

(c)	all members, other than NRMA Holdings Limited, would give up their
membership of each of the Association and Insurance in return
for the issue of
fully paid shares in NRMA Holdings Limited; and
<P>

(d)	this would result in NRMA Holdings Limited being the only shareholder of
each of the Association and Insurance.
<P>

1.3	The restructuring of the NRMA Group may not follow the steps outlined in
the preceding paragraph but, essentially, whatever
those steps are, the
practical effect is that:
<P>

(a)	NRMA Holdings Limited will have become the sole shareholder of each of the
Association and Insurance; and
<P>

(b)	the former members of each of the Association and Insurance will have given
up their membership of each of the Association and
Insurance in return for the
right to receive fully paid shares in NRMA Holdings Limited."
<P>

575	Another is the summary of the basis of entitlement, drawn together as the
"Entitlement Rules" by Mr Bateman and sent to Ms Godwin
on 2 May 1994.  In at
least two places it gave as the reason for entitlements that "members of the
Association have legal rights
and it is in return for giving up those rights
that an entitlement to shares in NRMA Holdings Limited will be offered to that
member".
 When Mr Morgan prepared some amended Entitlement Rules, provided to
Ms Godwin on 19 May 1994, he said that the members of Association
and the
members of Insurance (other than Association and its directors) "give up their
entitlement to membership in consideration
of receiving shares in NRMA Holdings
Limited or an interest in the Default Trust".
<P>

576	A third illustration, from a memorandum of 5 May 1995 by Mr Morgan, is his
"summary of restructuring steps" -
<P>

"1.	HoldCo becomes a member of Association and Insurance.
<P>

2.	Prospectus registered incorporating Notice of Meeting.
<P>

3.	Members meetings.  At members meetings the following resolutions are
passed.
<P>

(a)	Articles affecting [sic] change of status are approved including change in
winding up provisions providing for assets to be
distributed to members on
winding up;
<P>

(b)	new Article to be inserted providing that on condition that HoldCo
completes offer, the members agree to the cancellation of
their membership in
consideration of HoldCo issuing shares to members in accordance with the
entitlements proposal on the basis that
the value thereby transferred to HoldCo
be applied to pay up the shares with the balance being paid to a share premium
account.
<P>

4.	Offer to members to take shares closes at date of meeting or later date -
query.
<P>

5.	Shares allotted to accepting members but not issued and balance of shares
issued to default trust.
<P>

6.	Default trust opens secondary offer - pricing mechanism to be determined and
allocation rules to be determined.
<P>

7.	secondary offer closes and shares issued to accepting members and
transferred by default trust to persons provided with allocation
under
secondary offer.
<P>

8.	ASX Listing."
<P>

577	Further tracing of the development of the proposal in these reasons will be
minimal.  The proposal was now essentially in the
form in due course
adopted.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed on paid-up shares</b>
<P>

578	The advice of senior counsel foreshadowed by Mr Morgan in the paper of
7 April 1994 was sought by a brief to Mr Heydon dated
19 April
1994.  
<P>

579	The brief set out the alternative structures then under consideration,
while saying that the HoldCo takeover structure was favoured
and that the
advice was sought in relation to it.  The brief then stated -
<P>

<b>"The Specific Issue upon which we seek advice</b>
<P>

We seek Counsel's advice upon one specific issue relevant to the first
structure.
<P>

That structure provides that the shares to be issued by HoldCo will be paid up
from the value of the NRMA Group transferred to HoldCo
as a result of HoldCo
becoming the only member of Association and Insurance after the existing
members have given up their rights
of membership. That is, members give up
their rights as members in consideration of HoldCo using the consideration that
flows from
this retirement (the value of the NRMA Group which is owned solely
by HoldCo) to pay-up the shares issued by HoldCo to members.
<P>

In other words, the paid up capital for the HoldCo shares is not subscribed
directly by members or provided by way of dividend.
<P>

The question is whether the shares to be issued by HoldCo may be paid up in
this way?"
<P>

580	It will be seen that this was a more precise statement of the corporations
law problem.  Two sides of a bargain were identified,
on one side the members
giving up their rights of membership, so that a practical matter the wealth of
the NRMA went to HoldCo as
the remaining (shareholder) member, and on the other
side HoldCo issuing shares fully paid, as a practical matter using that wealth.
The perceived problem was whether HoldCo could issue shares fully paid when
they were paid up not by shareholders' subscriptions,
in cash or by application
of a dividend, but by HoldCo acquiring the wealth of the NRMA as a practical
consequence of the members
giving up their rights of membership.
<P>

581	The observations in the brief then discussed consideration other than cash
consideration, with reference to certain provisions
of the Law and cases
supporting the proposition that the courts will generally not examine the value
of non-cash consideration provided
it is not illusory.  The brief concluded,
perhaps mis-stating the perceived problem -
<P>

"In the case of the NRMA, the consideration for the relinquishment of
membership is the allotment of shares by HoldCo to the (former)
members of
Association and Insurance the value for which derives from the value of the
NRMA Group of which HoldCo is the sole member
(prior to the allotment being
made).
<P>

We do not see a difficulty with this consideration being recognised by the law
but we seek Senior Counsel's confirmation."
<P>

582	A copy of the brief was sent to Ms Godwin and Mr Bateman.  A
conference with Mr Heydon was arranged for 29 April 1994.  
<P>

583	The conference was attended by Mr Morgan, Mr Simpson, and
Mr Bateman.  Again recollections of what was said at the conference
were
not good.  Mr Heydon had no note of the conference.  Mr Morgan, Mr Simpson, and
Mr Bateman did have notes of the conference,
of variable clarity. 
<P>

584	According to Mr Bateman, during the conference there was discussion of the
difficulty of attributing any value to an individual
membership of Association,
and of the even greater difficulty of attributing any value to an individual
membership of Insurance.
 Mr Heydon referred to provisions of the memoranda and
articles of Association and Insurance, and made a number of comments to the
effect that the memberships were for practical purposes not transferable, that
it was doubtful if dividends could be paid, that on
a winding-up of Insurance
the surplus assets went to Association and on a winding-up of Association the
surplus assets went to an
organisation with similar objects, and that
membership of Association ended if not paid for each year and membership of
Insurance
ended if no policy was held.  Still according to Mr Bateman, Mr
Heydon said that a member of Association had "a bundle of very weak
rights
conferred by equity and the Corporations Law", and that they did not amount to
much, and later said -
<P>

"Yes, there is a real difficulty putting any value on an individual membership
of the Association.  It is even harder in the case
of a membership of the
Insurance company.  That being the case, I agree with your analysis, John
[Morgan].
<P>

It does seem to me that HoldCo will receive valuable consideration, not from an
individual member giving up his membership, but
from the overall value that
HoldCo receives as a result of it becoming the only member of each of the
Association and the Insurance
company.  That seems to be quite a proper form of
valuable consideration and would enable HoldCo to issue the shares credited as
paid up to their par value.
<P>

It's one of those strange situations where HoldCo receives a lot in value by
getting control of the two companies by virtue of all
the members collectively
giving up their memberships.  Something of value is only received because they
all give up their memberships
together and they do so at the one time.  The
parts only become worth something when given up as a whole.
<P>

I think the consideration that HoldCo receives by getting control of the two
companies, in the way you've put it in the brief, is
fine.  That can pay up the
shares that HoldCo issues."
<P>

585	Mr Heydon did not dispute that he confirmed Mr Morgan's views in the brief,
but did not recall the relatively detailed matters
recounted by Mr Bateman.  He
did dispute that he described the rights of members of Association and
Insurance as very weak rights.
 Nor did Mr Morgan and Mr Simpson dispute that
Mr Heydon confirmed Mr Morgan's views in the brief, and Mr Morgan's note said
"paid
up value OK":  neither had any real recollection of this aspect of the
conference.
<P>

586	Towards the end of the conference there was raised the intention, recently
brought out on further consideration of entitlements,
that employees of the
NRMA should be issued with shares even if they were not members.  It may be
that the perceived relevance to
the question in the brief was that the
employees would not be relinquishing membership and so would not be fulfilling
one side of
the bargain.  According to Mr Bateman, Mr Heydon suggested that
employees should be made members "so that when the members collectively
give up
their membership HoldCo is receiving valuable consideration which enables it to
pay up the shares".  Mr Heydon recalled the
topic being discussed.  Mr Morgan
recalled a question of giving entitlements to shares to staff of the NRMA who
were not members,
and that whatever the problem was could be resolved by the
board admitting the staff as members.  This was no doubt the reason for
Mr
Morgan's note "staff members?  Admit as new members?  FBT", and it was probably
the source of that part of Mr Simpson's note reading
"Empees will be
`given' shares in HoldCo but they are not members at moment".  Mr Bateman's
note referred to what must have been
the same matter in different words,
"preferable that all those offered an entitlement be made members.  This will
allow clear view
on [word scratched out] consideration".  
<P>

587	The word scratched out may have been "oppression", and Mr Bateman said that
the discussion concerning the conferring of benefits
in the form of shares to
be issued by the holding company to persons who were not members of either
Association or Insurance threw
up whether there was some form of oppression,
and that there was some discussion of that.  According to Mr Bateman, Mr Heydon
expressed
the view that you could justify giving non-members the benefit of
shares in the holding company if members understood that they were
doing it,
and that if they understood that would avoid oppression - if members chose to
confer the benefits, there would be no oppression.
 But Mr Heydon said that it
would be more prudent to make those persons members, as it would make clear the
whole matter of consideration,
and for that reason employees in particular
should, if possible, be made members so as to be entitled to the shares, and
that would
deal with both issues.  
<P>

588	This is unexceptional, and I do not think the others present at the
conference really disputed that the discussion led on to
a fairly passing
reference to oppression.  I accept Mr Bateman's account of the conference,
although I do not think it matters whether
members' rights were described as
very weak rights - in one sense they were weak, in another sense they had the
strength of any equitable
or statutory rights, and Mr Bateman and Mr Heydon may
have had different perspectives which have now influenced their recollections.
But the occasion was not one for detailed advice about oppression, still less
(as the NRMA seemed to suggest) for attention to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  The
point was a short one - employees should be made members for reasons to do with
consideration, and that would also remove any
possible complaint about giving
benefits to non-members.
<P>

<b>Early attention to the drafting of the prospectus</b>
<P>

589	By a letter to Ms Godwin dated 22 February 1994, Mr Barry and Ms Birch had
provided an outline of the document intended to contain
the notices of meeting
and prospectus.  The letter recorded that they had had a preliminary discussion
of the outline with Mr Morgan,
and suggested that there be a meeting early in
the next week to discuss it in more detail.  By a letter to Ms Conway dated 24
February
1994, Mr Bateman had provided slightly amended versions of the proxy
and acceptance forms plus a draft notice of meeting for Association.
 The
letter recorded that the acceptance form wording "proceeds on certain
assumptions which, depending on how the offer is structured,
may prove not to
be correct."  At this time the proposal was not fully settled, but attention
was being given to what became the
prospectus and the onsert.
<P>

590	In early March 1994 BT suggested that a prospectus working group should be
established to manage the preparation of the prospectus.
 The first meeting of
what later became the prospectus working group was held on 4 March 1994.  It
was attended by Mr Pearce, Ms
Godwin, Mr Barry, Ms Birch, Mr Morgan, and Mr
Bateman.  The principal matter discussed seems to have been whether a so-called
"short
form" prospectus could be used, but that depended amongst other things
on progress towards the final form of the proposal.  The prospectus
working
group was, or became, distinct from a separate group concerned with the onsert.
The group concerned with the onsert was eventually
the logistics working group,
it seems amongst other reasons because the onsert involved the technology of
bar-coding to keep track
of proxies and acceptances.
<P>

591	It was, of course, important that the prospectus contain all necessary
information for members to make an informed decision:
 the NRMA had been made
well aware of that.  At board level, it will be recalled that at the meeting of
the board of Association
on 17 March 1994 Mr Talbot asked that his
dissent be noted on the grounds that he wanted more time to consider the
proposal.  Within
a short time it was apparent that, as expected,
Mr Talbot was opposed to the proposal, and that his opposition had some
support from
Miss Fraser and Ms Singleton.  The recognition that
there were disadvantages in the proposal to be weighed against the advantages
seen by management, and now, if not before, seen by the majority on the boards
of Association and Insurance, proceeded against the
background of advice that
the prospectus should not be misleading and should contain all such information
as the members would reasonably
require in order to make an informed decision
upon the proposal.  Knowledge in that respect of the obligations of Association
and
Insurance, in due course of Holdings, and of their directors, was not in
issue in the proceedings.  
<P>

592	It was also not in issue that the matter proceeded against the background
of advice that it was not necessary to put a specific
`no' case in the
prospectus.  I have already referred to the `no' case, and will refer to it
again.  Mr Simpson gave evidence of
research at the request of Mr Morgan to
determine whether there was an obligation to put a `no' case in the prospectus,
and of his
conclusion and Mr Morgan's agreement that it was not.  Mr Morgan
replied to a question from Mr Mackay or Mr Willing at a meeting,
possibly of
the due diligence committee, saying it was not necessary to put a `no' case in
the prospectus, but that the law required
that sufficient information be given
to members to enable them to make an informed decision on the proposal that was
being put to
them.
<P>

593	The description of shares to be issued by the holding company came to be
referred to as free shares came to be used in connection
with the prospectus.

<P>

594	An early illustration is a letter dated 23 March 1994 from Mr Bateman
to Ms Godwin outlining a possible staged listing of the
holding company.
He stated some assumptions as -
<P>

"2.1	The net worth of the NRMA Group is $2.2b.
<P>

2.2	The 1.8m members are to receive that net worth in the form of shares in
HoldCo, with average of $1,222 worth of shares per member.
<P>

2.3	The members will be offered those shares at nil cost. They are `free'
shares. The offer period will be 5 September to 5 October
(`<b><u>the
first offer</u></b>').
<P>

2.4	An average member is to receive 244 shares, each worth $5 (total value
$1,222). The range of free shares to be offered to each
member will be 100 to
400 depending on years of membership and holding of a policy."
<P>

Then in para 4.4 of the letter Mr Bateman said -
<P>

The first offer (to members) is of free shares.  The prospectus need not,
therefore, be very lengthy.  Rather than printing financials
and other expert
reports in full, the conclusions only should be published.  This will satisfy
both the Corporations Law and the
Stock Exchange's need for a prospectus
...".
<P>

595	This use was initially qualified.  Mr Morgan provided comments on the
letter.  They included -
<P>

"In paragraph 4.4, the underlying reason for the short form prospectus is
unclear. Is it:
<P>

(a)	because the offer or invitation is `of free shares' that the offer or
invitation is an `excluded offer or invitation' being
one for which:
<P>

	`No consideration is paid or provided in respect of the contract resulting
from acceptance of the offer or from acceptance of an
offer made pursuant to
the invitation'.
<P>

	We do not agree with this analysis. Consideration is provided:
<P>

(i)	by the members in giving up their current rights as members of Association
and Insurance;
<P>

(ii)	by HoldCo in the manner of funding of the par value of the shares.
<P>

It is not possible for no consideration to be provided `in respect of the
contract resulting from acceptance of the offer' because
the shares that are
allotted to members by HoldCo must be paid up;"
<P>

Someone underlined in a copy of Mr Bateman's letter of 23 March 1994 the word
"free" in para 2.3, and wrote "not so" against it.
 
<P>

596	So the contrast was evident.  The shares were free in the sense that no
cash was to be paid by the members to whom they were
to be issued.  They were
not free in the sense that the members gave up their rights as members in
return for the shares.  But they
could be called free shares in the prospectus.

<P>

597	Mr Bateman's note of a meeting held with Ms Godwin, Mr Hosking,
Mr Morgan, and Mr Barry on 28 March 1994 included that he should
draft notices of meeting, proxy forms, and an explanatory memorandum -
<P>

"... on basis that:
<P>

(a)	HoldCo will be listed coy
<P>

(b)	shares will be issued for free because right to take up shares in A &amp;
Ins will pass to HoldCo &amp; that valuable consideration
received by HoldCo
with enable HoldCo to issue HoldCo shares fully paid".
<P>

That is, the shares would be issued fully paid, and there would be no payment
by the members to whom the shares were issued.  
<P>

598	According to Mr Bateman, at the meeting he asked on what basis he should
proceed, saying that the structure, and in particular
how people got their
shares, was still unclear;  Ms Godwin said that "it looks like HoldCo will
issue its shares for free to members
on the basis that the right to take up the
shares in each of Association and Insurance will pass to HoldCo";  Mr Morgan
said that
that was the present thinking, and that he had put the matter before
Mr Heydon to make sure there were no problems with paying up
the shares to be
issued by HoldCo;  and Ms Godwin said to go ahead on the basis which Mr Bateman
then noted.  There is some obscurity
in this, because at this time members'
rights, rather than rights to take up shares in Association and Insurance, were
becoming the
consideration:  maybe the thinking was in transition.  Further, as
at 28 March 1994 Mr Morgan had not briefed Mr Heydon on paid-up
shares, and Mr
Bateman's recollection may be astray.
<P>

599	At a logistics planning session on 29 March 1994 NRMA representatives
and Mr Bateman considered the holding of information meetings
prior to the
general meetings.  Those present decided to recommend the holding of
information meetings, and in the course of discussion
the question arose
whether it was necessary that there be separate "yes" and "no" cases in the
prospectus in the manner sometimes
adopted for referenda.  The minutes of the
meeting recorded the advice given by Mr Bateman -
<P>

"In theory directors could not actively campaign for the yes vote at the
information meetings. This would mean that they would have
to make sure they
only gave information that did not lead to a yes or no conclusion.
<P>

Alternatively, as long as the directors did not spend an unreasonable amount
campaigning for the `yes' vote and didn't mislead the
members, they could put
the balanced view specified in the prospectus. (NB Directors not obliged to put
in separate yes and no arguments
in prospectus as long as explanatory material
contains reference to the negative opinion.)"
<P>

600	A meeting of various members of NRMA management plus communications
advisers plus Mr Bateman on 12 April 1994 sought to establish
the
format of the prospectus.  According to Mr Bateman's file note, it was
decided that there should be "Shortest Possible Full Prospectus",
so the idea
of a short form prospectus was abandoned.  This file note contained the first
clear reference to the onsert in the words
"Forms (Proxy &amp; Acceptance) as
`Onsert'".  
<P>

601	The description of free shares was now current.  In connection with
acceptance or otherwise of shares in the holding company,
Mr Bateman's file
note of the meeting of 12 April 1994 referred to "Entitlement (free shares)",
and his file note of a further meeting
on 13 April 1994, attended by
members of NRMA management, communications advisers, and Messrs Morgan and
Bateman, at which there
was further considered the framing of the prospectus,
included -
<P>

"Message must be vote &amp; free shares are on offer (with tick box for cash).
Only say cash is so much, by then [?], &amp; not
from NRMA.
<P>

Vote &amp; get free shares/cash"
<P>

602	Mr Bateman prepared a draft outline of the prospectus dated
19 April 1994.  Although only an outline, in most places simply
indicating
the nature of the information to be included, it took fifty-four pages.  It did
not refer to free shares, but did not
describe the shares to be issued in any
particular way.  The draft foreshadowed a fairly complex document.
<P>

603	The prospectus working group had become established by early April 1994.
It had not got to the detail of the prospectus by the
end of April 1994, but
there was some canvassing of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal
in the media.  Further, The
Open Road for April/May 1994 contained a
President's message generally in favour of the proposal, although saying that
members had
the choice, and gave details of the proposal in a question and
answer manner also generally in favour of the proposal.  At the meeting
of the
board of Association held on 28 April 1994 Mr Talbot moved a motion,
which was seconded by Miss Fraser, that "Those Directors
who hold a view
other than that expressed by the President in the Open Road magazine be given
equal opportunity to express such opinion
in the Open Road".  The motion was
defeated.
<P>

604	According to Mr Bateman's notes, at a meeting on 2 May 1994 attended
by Ms Godwin, Mr Hosking, Mr Barry, Ms Birch, Mr Morgan,
and Mr Bateman it was
decided (referring what the notes described as the explanatory memorandum,
which became Section 1 of the prospectus)
that Mr Bateman should "now
draft it from go to woe [prophetically, sic]".  This decision broadly coincided
with the adoption by
the due diligence committee of the materiality guidelines,
which as has been seen included amongst the qualitative factors to be
taken
into account "matters that we would ordinarily assume the readers of the
Prospectus would reasonably require or expect inclusion
or comment upon".  Mr
Bateman must have been aware of this, and in any event was familiar with the
relevant principles.  According
to a file note dated 5 May 1994, he told Mr
Stern that the duties of directors were to provide all information reasonably
necessary
to enable a person to determine how to vote, and that this was "based
on a person on the run who scans the Ex St quickly"  
<P>

605	There was further consideration of how to deal with the disadvantages of
the proposal, or the so-called "no" case.  That there
was something to be said
against the proposal was clearly recognised, and it is sufficient to refer to
the briefing book prepared
for the board retreat held on 7 May 1994 as
envisaged at the time of the board approvals on 17 March 1994.  It included a
section
reading -
<P>

606	The further consideration included, according to the record of a
communications meeting on 6 May 1994, that amongst the key
opposition issues
was "impact on the cost of policy/membership", a matter which was reflected in
Mr Bateman's note of the meeting
as "the NO case".  
<P>

607	At the communications meeting on 11 May 1994 it was decided, according
to the record of the meeting, "Open Road/Prospectus `for
and against' article:
SB and Greg B to draft".  SB was Mr Barrett.  A similar note was made in
the record of the meeting on 16 May
1994, and on both occasions the
article was recorded as due by 23 May 1994.  But the notes from the
meeting on 18 May 1994 had the
item "For &amp; Against.  When, if &amp;
how do we discuss it publicly?  SB to advise", with a due date of 27 May
1994, and the notes
for the meeting of 23 May 1994 said nothing about the
for and against article but retained the item asking about public discussion.
What happened in relation to the for and against article is not clear, but the
explanation probably lies in a file note of Mr Bateman
dated 24 May
1994 recording a communication with Mr Barrett, "He agrees that the
`yes'/'no' case should not be published except in
the Explanatory Statement".
In the result, therefore, the disadvantages were to be dealt with in the
prospectus.
<P>

608	It should not be thought that this was seen as lessening the need for full
and fair information.  It was clear that, in the
context of the known agitation
for a "no" case, the NRMA was advised that the prospectus should deal with
disadvantages as well as
advantages.  So much is apparent from a file note of
Mr Bateman dated 15 May 1994, recording a conversation with Mr Rees and Mr
Barrett
-
<P>

" -  confirming that the `no' arguments must be canvassed in the Ex
Statement
<P>

  -  if they are canvassed in the Open Road this reduces but does not exclude
the obligation to address them in [indecipherable]
Ex St."
<P>

609	Mr Bateman gave evidence that at meetings variously with Mr Willing, Mr
Rees, Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, Mr Barry, Ms Birch, Mr Stern,
and Mr Morgan in the
period March to May 1994 he said that the arguments for and against would have
to be canvassed as part of providing
all information reasonably necessary;
that what was material included reasons for and against;  and that there would
be difficulty
in separating out a "yes" case and a "no" case because it was
difficult to classify some matters as either for or against, it was
difficult
to rate the importance of issues, the importance of issues varied from member
to member, and there were a great many members
and so great diversity of, and
conflicting views on, issues.  Mr Morgan did not recall this, but said that his
own view at the time
was that the prospectus had to identify for members what
material changes would be brought by the proposal and that it was a matter
for
each member to decide whether he or she thought any such change was an
advantage or a disadvantage.  None of the NRMA personnel
who gave evidence
asserted that they were unaware of the need for full and fair information, or
were unaware that the arguments for
and against would have to be canvassed.
<P>

610	Mr Bateman provided a first draft of the explanatory statement to
Ms Godwin under cover of a letter of 30 May 1994.  It should
be
described at a little length:  what will be seen is that it referred to giving
up membership, used the language of free shares,
and included material
specifically directed to the arguments for and against the proposal.  Mr
Bateman's covering letter said that
the draft was "designed for severe
editing", and that there was repetition "with a view to others determining the
best way to present
certain arguments and the style in which those arguments
should be presented".
<P>

611	Early in the draft was -
<P>

                   "2.	<b>SOME IMMEDIATE ANSWERS YOU MAY BE SEEKING</b>
<P>

		Below are some of the questions to which you may be seeking immediate
answers.
<P>

		(a)	`In essence, what is the change I am being asked to vote on?' You are
being asked to swap your membership (which is a type
of part-ownership) of the
NRMA for some free shares (which is a better type of part-ownership) in the
NRMA. It is a better form of
part-ownership.
<P>

		(b)	`How can the NRMA give away free shares?' Because your membership of the
Association and NRMA Insurance are of value, when
you give your membership up,
control of the Association and NRMA Insurance (and thereby all the companies in
the NRMA) will be given
wholly to a new company, NRMA Holdings. NRMA Holdings
will then give you shares in return for what you have just given up. The NRMA
Holdings shares don't cost you anything because they've already been paid for
by you giving up your membership so that NRMA Holdings
can be the head company
in the NRMA.
<P>

		(c)	`Why is the NRMA doing this?' The type of part-ownership you presently
hold does not enable you to share in the wealth of
the NRMA. Your new form of
part-ownership is in the form of shares which means that you will be able to
receive income from the NRMA
in the form of dividends.
<P>

		(d)	`Why not simply reduce road service fees?' It is the Association which
provides members with road service. The Association
only ever makes a
relatively small profit. The more substantial profits made by NRMA Insurance
cannot, because of the unusual legal
structure of the NRMA, be passed across to
the Association. Hence, while the NRMA overall has good profit it can't be made
available
to the Association to enable it to reduce membership fees.
<P>

		(e)	`Then why not benefit members by reducing insurance premiums?' For a
start, 30% of all members of the Association do not even
have insurance
policies with NRMA Insurance. Hence that 30% would not be benefited by reducing
premiums. Also, there is a large and
increasing number of policyholders who are
not members of either the Association or NRMA Insurance. Why should they, as
valued customers,
get reductions at the expense of those policyholders who are
members? If these problems could be overcome there is still the serious
problem
that a significant reduction in premiums would destabilise the insurance market
as some of our less financially strong competitors
tried to keep up by price
cutting. This would create risk for the community at large and would,
therefore, be wrong.
<P>

		(f)	`If you have shares, how will you stop some bigger company taking over
the NRMA?' The constitution of NRMA Holdings prevents
anyone having more than
4% of the shares. These special rules have been drawn very tightly to stop
people getting round them. This
will ensure that the NRMA will continue to be
owned by a vast number of people each owning shares in NRMA Holdings.
<P>

		(g)	`Won't the NRMA be forced to raise prices to satisfy the new
shareholders?' Hopefully every member will accept the offer of
free shares. In
this way the NRMA will be quite unique in that its customers (those who have
insurance policies and those who want
road service) will also be its
shareholders. In reality, it is more likely that some members will prefer to
take the cash value of
the shares being offered and so they would not end up
being shareholders. Their protection against price rises is simply what happens
throughout Australia for any company - competition.
<P>

			If, for example, you are a customer of Woolworths, prices in its stores are
kept competitive by its many competitors, regardless
of whether Woolworths is
listed on the Stock Exchange or not. So it is with the NRMA, except that in the
case of the NRMA there is
the unique opportunity to be both customer and
shareholder and, by holding shares, receive a share in the profit that you
cannot
get access to at the moment.
<P>

		Please note that because the above is a `potted summary' of some of the
questions and answers, you really must read the fuller
explanation of the
issues in what follows.
<P>

	<b>3.	WHAT ARE THE ARGUMENTS `FOR' AND `AGAINST' THE PROPOSAL?</b>
<P>

		In what follows you will find background information and a discussion of the
issues which may be significant for members to consider.
The importance of any
issue will vary from member to member. Some aspects of an issue will be seen as
positive by some members, negative
by others and quite unimportant to others
again. The arguments `for' and `against' the proposal must, therefore, depend
on each member's
view of the issues raised by the proposal. All members are
encouraged to read this Explanatory Statement.
<P>

		Your directors, having considered all the issues, believe that a vote in
favour of the proposal is in the interests of all members.
<P>

	<b>4.	WHY IS THE NRMA DOING THIS?</b>
<P>

		The NRMA has been concerned for some time that its financial success has not
been shared adequately with the members, who own
the NRMA.
<P>

		The practical problems that face the NRMA in giving its members access to the
wealth of the NRMA are primarily caused by the unusual
features of the key
legal relationship in the present structure of the NRMA. This is explained
below, initially under the heading
`Present Structure of the NRMA', and later
under the heading `Guarantee Companies'.
<P>

		Over the past 2 years NRMA Insurance has given back $180 million in the form
of insurance rebates. However, this provides only
a short term solution, and
only benefits policyholders and does not benefit the 30% or so of members who
are not policyholders. We
have also considered reducing insurance premiums but,
because of the dominance of NRMA Insurance in the NSW market, this would have
a
de-stabilising effect on the insurance market. Once again, only policyholders
would benefit - not all members.
<P>

		After much thought we see the issuing of shares as the best long-term
solution. The 2 principal benefits which arise from a member
owning shares in
the NRMA are:
<P>

		*	income in the form of dividends on the shares; and
<P>

		*	capital growth from a rise in the share price on the Stock Exchange.
<P>

		In this way members of the NRMA would, for the first time, have access to the
wealth of the NRMA."
<P>

612	There was then a description of the structure of the NRMA, of the
weaknesses in that structure, and of the proposed structure,
and some
discussion of the nature of companies limited by guarantee.  The draft
continued -
<P>

                   "<b>8.	WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE THERE?</b>
<P>

		Your directors have put before members the proposal which was felt would best
meet the needs of current and future members.
<P>

		It is inappropriate, therefore, to put forward other proposals which your
directors feel would be inferior. As evidenced by the
size of this NRMA Float
Pack it is a complex and exacting task putting any proposal of such magnitude
into action. Confusion would
reign if, for example, 2 or more alternative
proposals (for restructuring the NRMA) were to be put to the members to vote
on.
<P>

		Set out below is a short description of some alternatives that might be
thought relevant to the discussion. The most obvious one
is that nothing should
change. All the others must involve some change and, as noted above, they are
not being pursued because they
are viewed as inferior to the proposal now
before the members.
<P>

		<b>No Change</b>
<P>

		It is not essential that the proposal before members be implemented. Life
could go on under the present structure without much
difficulty. Why do it
then?
<P>

		The answer is that things could be so much better for members if they became
shareholders in the NRMA listed on the Stock Exchange.
If there is a better way
of doing things for members it should be investigated and, if appropriate,
implemented. That is the fundamental
viewpoint that derives the proposal now
before the members.
<P>

		<b>No change in structure, but reduce prices</b>
<P>

		A natural response to the statement that the members can't get access to the
wealth of the NRMA might be `give it back to the
members in lower prices for
road service and lower insurance premiums.'
<P>

		Such a response does not offer a solution because it fails to recognise a
number of realities which are discussed below.
<P>

		<b>Why a reduction in road service fees is not the answer</b>
<P>

		Taking first the question of `returning the wealth' by reducing road service
fees, the realities are:
<P>

		*	NRMA Insurance makes very substantial profits, whilst the Association only
makes a relatively small profit.
<P>

		*	The profits of NRMA Insurance cannot, by law, be given to the Association.
The profits of NRMA Insurance are for the benefit
of NRMA Insurance (because it
is a company limited by guarantee) and if its profits could be distributed,
they would go to their
1.3 million policyholder members, not the
Association.
<P>

		*	Accordingly, the Association has no capacity to reduce annual subscription
for road service. It does not have sufficient profits
of its own to safely do
this and it cannot get access to the more substantial profits of NRMA Insurance
to help do this either.
<P>

		<b>Why reducing premiums is not the answer</b>
<P>

		It is a number of different problems that prevents NRMA Insurance from
benefiting members by reducing premiums. Here the realities
are:
<P>

		*	30% of all members of the Association do not even have insurance policies
with NRMA Insurance. Hence, that 30% would not be
benefited by reducing
premiums.
<P>

		*	#% of all policyholders are not members of NRMA Insurance. Hence, reduction
in premiums for them is not benefiting true members
of NRMA Insurance.
Effectively those policyholders, who are of course greatly valued customers,
are simply being given a reduction
in price, which would be at the expense of
those policyholders who are members.
<P>

		*	If reductions in premiums were only given to those policyholders who were
also members of the Association, this would most likely
fall foul of provisions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.
<P>

		*	Even if some scheme could be devised which would allow for a reduction in
premiums in a way designed to benefit policyholder
members, because of the
dominance of NRMA Insurance in the NSW market, it would have a de-stabilising
effect on the insurance market.
Our competitors would be forced to reduce their
premiums in order to compete and, because some are not as financially strong as
others,
there is increased risk for such companies. Exposing the community at
large to such risk would be wrong.
<P>

		<b>How the proposed structure offers the solution</b>
<P>

		The solution to the problems described above is to be found in the proposal
now before the members. Under the proposed structure:
<P>

		*	The profits of each of the Association and NRMA Insurance will be fully
available to NRMA Holdings - both `profit pools' will
then be brought together,
which is not possible in the present structure.
<P>

		*	That profit can be distributed to the shareholders of NRMA Holdings who, if
members have accepted the offer of free shares,
will be the former members of
the Association.
<P>

		*	The profit that is distributed to the shareholders of NRMA Holdings (in the
form of a dividend) is likely to be `franked' which
means that the shareholders
will be given a credit, to some degree, against their tax liability on the
dividend.
<P>

		*	NRMA Insurance will continue to be competitive in the setting of insurance
premiums for policyholders.
<P>

		*	The Association will continue to provide road service as part of an annual
subscription which is reasonable.
<P>

		*	The owners of the NRMA, being the shareholders of NRMA Holdings, will have
a greater interest in voting on matters put to shareholders
(including the
election of directors of NRMA Holdings) as they will have a direct financial
interest in the NRMA.
<P>

		<b>Other structures</b>
<P>

		As already noted, once a decision to change the structure of the NRMA is
made, it is then a question of what is the best structure.
Other structures,
which are viewed by your directors as not as good as that upon which members
are asked to vote, include the following:
<P>

		*	Why not do the same as what is proposed, except do not list NRMA Holdings
on the Stock Exchange? It might be thought this would
offer the advantage of
not exposing NRMA Holdings to takeovers. That view would be misplaced on 2
counts. First, the Articles of
NRMA Holdings have takeover protections in them
in the form of a limit on any shareholder having more than 5% of the shares.
This
is discussed later under the heading `Can the NRMA be Taken Over?'.
Second, a company with a significant number of shareholders is
subject to the
rules in the law concerning takeovers, whether it is listed on the Stock
Exchange or not.
<P>

		*	Why not sever the link between the Association and NRMA Insurance? This
approach may be coupled with suggestions that either,
or both of them, remain
as companies limited by guarantee or that they issue shares. Such an approach
suffers from a number of basic
problems. The first is that the strength of the
NRMA has been the existence of those 2 companies in tandem, each benefiting
from
the other. If they were to go their separate ways, each would be weaker.
The value of the combination is greater than its parts.
Second, each uses
assets owned by the other and there would be significant financial consequences
for each company to effect such
a separation. Third, a separation of the 2
would mean splitting the management and staff of the NRMA on some basis between
the 2,
with the likely fracturing of that culture of the NRMA which has made it
a pre-eminent quality service provider.
<P>

		*	There are other concepts, combinations of ideas, and so on. In the final
analysis each of the alternatives usually suffers from
a number of problems
which are like the above or there is some other significant legal or commercial
barrier which make such alternative
unacceptable.
<P>

	<b>9.	HOW DOES HAVING SHARES SOLVE THE PROBLEM?</b>
<P>

		Under the proposed structure shares are offered, free of charge, to the
members. It is hoped that all members will elect to accept
the free shares
rather than ending up with the cash equivalent.
<P>

		For those who accept the free shares they, as shareholders in NRMA Holdings,
will be entitled to:
<P>

		*	income in the form of dividends on the shares;
<P>

		*	capital growth from a rise in the share price; and
<P>

		*	if the shareholder ever needed to, some or all of those shares could be
sold.
<P>

	<b>10.WILL PROFIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS MEAN PRICES WILL GO UP?</b>
<P>

		Some members may be wondering whether the listing of the NRMA on the Stock
Exchange will mean that there will be continual pressure
on the directors to
make profit and that, to achieve that, the premiums for policies and the annual
subscriptions for road service
will go up.
<P>

		The answer is that it is competition which determines prices, not whether the
supplier is listed on the Stock Exchange or not.
If you are a customer of
Woolworths you will know that in their stores prices are kept competitive by
its many competitors, regardless
of whether Woolworths is listed on the Stock
Exchange or not. The NRMA has many competitors large and small in the insurance
market.
Some of these competitors are, by the way, listed and some are not.
That competition is the guarantee that the premium the NRMA charges
will be
competitive.
<P>

		It is true that the NRMA does not have a great deal of competition in the
area of road service. This could change if the NRMA
was foolish enough to
increase annual fees unreasonably.
<P>

		There is also another factor to bear in mind. If, as your directors hope, you
do accept the offer of free shares, you will be
in the special position of
being both a customer of the NRMA (by holding insurance policies and your
Service Membership) and a shareholder.
There are not many companies in the
world who would be listed on the Stock Exchange who have as its shareholders
its valued customers!"
<P>

613	As will appear, this first draft was later significantly changed, and the
drafting passed from Mr Bateman.  To concentrate for
the moment on the free
shares problem, the use of the language of free shares is plain in the extracts
I have set out, and there
were other references to free shares in the draft.
In describing the procedure for listing it was said that the "offer of free
shares
to the 1.8 million members" closed on a particular date, that a
member might by returning the acceptance form "elect to take either
the free
shares or the cash value of those shares", and that all of the "free shares"
not accepted by members by a later date would
be offered for sale;  as well, in
describing how many shares would be issued and who was entitled to shares there
were a number of
references to free shares or the free shares.  
<P>

614	The use of this language is consistent with Mr Bateman's evidence that, at
a logistics meeting or a meeting of the prospectus
working group at about the
end of May 1994, either Ms Godwin or Mrs Storrs asked, "We can use `free
shares' now can't we?", and Mr
Simpson replied, "Yes, we have already signed
off on `free shares' as acceptable to use."  Mr Simpson denied any such
question and
answer, and said that he did not recall being at any logistics
meeting or meeting of the prospectus working group in late May 1994.
 There may
have been some imprecision in dating.  What is quite clear is that, to the
knowledge of all concerned, the description
"free shares" was used, and
continued to be used, and by the end of May 1994 AAH had in a sense signed off
on "free shares" as acceptable
to use in the entitlements letters to which I
will shortly refer.  Its reservation in relation to the entitlements letters
did not
apply to the prospectus, since the prospectus would be issued only when
the means of implementing the proposal was firm.  I accept
that something to
the effect recalled by Mr Bateman was said at about the end of May 1994.
<P>

615	While Mr Bateman's draft used "free shares", it did not use the capitalised
"Free Shares" found in the final version of the
prospectus.  The use of Free
Shares seems to have come about in a number of steps.
<P>

616	A draft of the then <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of the prospectus, which ultimately became
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a>, had already been prepared by BT.  It referred to the Members Primary
Offer and the Secondary Offer, saying in relation to the first
of these that
members "may elect to receive their entitlement to Shares in NRMA Holdings at
no cost or to receive the Cash Equivalent".
 The descriptions "Members Free
Offer" and "Sale Offer" were not used.  
<P>

617	At a meeting of the prospectus working group on 1 June 1994 Mr Rees
expressed dissatisfaction with the descriptive phrases in
the BT draft, amongst
other things saying that he did not want members thinking that they had to pay
for shares in the primary offer
and that the best way to make that clear was
the call it the Members Free Offer instead of the Members Primary Offer.
Someone else
suggested calling the second stage the Sale Offer, and Mr Rees
said that those would be the descriptions used.  Ms Godwin's note
of the
meeting included -
<P>

"2  Terminology
<P>

	(1)	Can we call - members offer - free offer
<P>

			        - secondary offer - sale offer"
<P>

Ticks appeared next to each query.  The evidence included a version of the BT
draft printed out by AAH on 1 June 1994 - presumably
AAH had obtained a
computer disc - amended in the writing of Mr Morgan to change "Members Primary
Offer" to "Free Offer" and "Secondary
Offer" to "Sale Offer", and another
version printed out on the same day with those changes.  
<P>

618	Mr Rees also said, at the same meeting, that the phrase Free Offer or
Members Free Offer would be used throughout the prospectus,
not just in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a>, in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> and wherever else it was relevant to tell members
about the free offer of shares.  Mr Bateman's note of the meeting included -
<P>

" - Closing Date of Free Offer is 5 October
<P>

  -  All references to Free Offer goes into the Explanatory Statement"
<P>

So it must have been agreed that the descriptions would be used generally, as
would be expected.  The drafting of the onsert took
up the descriptions, see
later in these reasons.
<P>

619	The final step to Free Shares was not spelled out in the evidence, but it
can be seen how the use of Free Offer would bring
change from "free shares" to
"Free Shares".  This had happened by 16 June 1994, as is evident from a further
draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus of that date.  By this time, as will be
explained, Mr Bateman had been displaced as the draftsman.  The final step
was
probably taken by Ms Godwin or Mr Barrett, but of course Mr Morgan and Mr
Bateman knew of it from their consideration of the
draft and its successors.
<P>

<b>The entitlements letters</b>
<P>

620	A major external communication after 17 March 1994 was the entitlements
letters, and they came to use the language of free shares.
 I have already
described their nature.  
<P>

621	A meeting on 29 March 1994, attended by Mr Bateman but not by Mr Morgan,
discussed the form and content of the entitlementS
letters.  Amongst other
things, it was decided that a "question and answer sheet" explaining the
proposal should accompany the letters.
 
<P>

622	Mr Bateman drafted the letters.  His drafts of 5 April 1994, four
different letters according to the entitlements, had headings
referring to
"entitlement to NRMA shares", included that the members could be asked to vote
later in the year to become "shareholders
in the organisation", and also
included, "It is our intention that the NRMA shares be free".  The drafts seem
to have been accompanied
by a draft brochure giving some explanation of the
proposal, the basis of entitlement, and the procedure for resolving disputes
over
entitlements, although it is not entirely clear that the brochure was then
in draft:  I will pass over it for the present.
<P>

623	The drafts of the entitlements letters were revised by Mr Bateman over the
next few days, without any substantial changes. 
A further draft of the main
entitlements letter was prepared, it seems by Mr Mamutil or at least not
by Mr Bateman, on or about 21
April 1994.  The heading now referred to
news "about <u>your</u> shares (worth at least $500) in NRMA", and the letter
now included, "The proposal is that shares in NRMA (worth <b>at least $500
</b>per member) will be given to NRMA's members absolutely free of charge", and
near the end referred to the "issue of free shares". 
A copy went to
Mr Bateman.  He made comments upon it, but not in relation to these words.

<P>

624	A committee of NRMA management and communications advisers met a little
later in April 1994, amongst other things to settle
the wording for this
entitlements letter, and decided that it should be redrafted.  No one attended
from the solicitors.  The minutes
of the meeting included -
<P>

"*	The intention of the entitlement letter is for it to be as much a selling
documents [sic] as it is to confirm details.
<P>

 *	The entitlement letter will be 2 pages, but in duplex form (ie back and
front of both sheets)
<P>

 *	Whether we say `free' shares was also discussed. It was decided that we will
consult with David Simpson regarding this.
<P>

 *	Stuart will re-draft these letters based on what has been discussed in this
meeting ...
<P>

 	...
<P>

 *	Regarding the brochure, Stuart has sent it to an agency to have it rewritten
...".
<P>

Stuart was Mr Stuart Salvage.  Ms O'Connell's notes of the same meeting reveal
the question about free shares:  they said "shares
won't be funded by mbr
--&gt; thro' dividend re-invest - do we say free".
<P>

625	The new drafts were provided to Mr Simpson on 28 April 1994.
They retained the sentence concerning shares absolutely free of
charge, and
followed it with the sentence, "This letter confirms  that you <b>[John A
Citizen]</b>, will receive free shares if the proposal goes ahead".  There were
added references to the receipt of shares being "All at no cost"
and to receipt
of the member's "entitlement to free shares" if the proposal was approved.  The
language of free shares was by now
thoroughly entrenched in the redrafting by
the NRMA, no doubt in aid of the entitlements letters being "selling
documents".
<P>

626	Mr Simpson wrote on one of the new drafts, apparently as a substituted
sentence, "This letter confirms that you will receive
free shares if the
proposal goes ahead".  He did not record any other dissent from the wording.
<P>

627	Further drafts of the entitlements letters were sent to Mr Simpson on
29 April 1994.  He wrote a number of alterations on one
of the drafts,
those of present particular significance being underlined -
<P>

"This letter confirms that <u>it is our intn that</u> you will <u>be entitled
to</u> receive shares in NRMA (of <b>at least $500</b> per member) <b>free of
charge</b> if the proposal goes ahead.
<P>

Long standing members will receive <b>even more shares</b> (up to twice as
many). And members who have an insurance policy with NRMA Insurance will also
receive additional shares. All at no
cost <u>to you</u>.
<P>

...
<P>

In the meantime it's important that we check our records to ensure that you
will receive <b>your full entitlement to free shares</b> if the proposal is
approved by members."
<P>

In the last of the paragraphs just set out the word "free" was circled with an
arrow of uncertain significance, and at the foot
of the page Mr Simpson
wrote within quotation marks "it is our intn that the shares be issued free."
In two later references in the
letter to the issue of free shares
Mr Simpson circled the word "free".
<P>

628	The next drafts of the entitlements letters, as at 5 May 1994, were
sent to Mr Morgan for his comments.  They seem to have been
redrafted by
Mr Salvage.  The heading now proclaimed "Important news about your free shares
(of at least 
<P>

$ - ) in NRMA", and the part of one of the drafts corresponding to that just
set out now read -
<P>

"The purpose of this letter is to confirm that you will receive <b>at least
$1,000 of free NRMA shares</b> if the proposal goes ahead.
<P>

The proposal is that shares in NRMA, from a minimum of $500, will be given to
NRMA members.
<P>

Long standing members will receive <b>even more shares</b> (up to twice as
many). And members, such a [sic] yourself, who also had an insurance policy
with NRMA Insurance at the cut-off date
will also receive <b>twice as many
shares again</b>. All at no cost.
<P>

...
<P>

Please check the following details to ensure that you do receive your full
entitlement of shares. Or, if you don't agree with the
details below, be sure
to let us know so that we can check the facts thoroughly before the share issue
takes place towards the end
of the year."
<P>

The two references later in the letter to the issue of free shares remained,
and there was a third.  The drafts were accompanied
by a draft of the brochure,
although the evidence did not include that draft.
<P>

629	Mr Morgan responded on 5 May 1994 with comments which included -
<P>

"<b>(a)	Paragraph 2</b>
<P>

...
<P>

Further, in relation to this section and also the heading to the letter, the
statement made is that the person will be receiving
`free NRMA shares'.
Previous statements had indicated that it was NRMA's intention that they be
free. Whether or not they are free
depends essentially upon the acceptance of
the current structure that is being discussed with the Australian Tax Office.
Although
we are more confident today that what is said here will be correct,
there is always the possibility that that will not be correct
and that we may
have to fall back to other methodologies to pay the shares up. A better
approach might be to use the word `free'
in the following sentence which
describes the proposal so it would in effect say, `The proposal is that shares
... will be given
free to NRMA members'.
<P>

<b>(b)	Paragraph 4</b>
<P>

In this paragraph and consequential upon the comments above, the statements
that members will `receive' shares should read in both
instances `will be
entitled to receive'.
<P>

<b>(c)	Page 2, First Paragraph</b>
<P>

Should the last sentence here be qualified by words to the effect `if the
proposal is approved by members' or `if the proposal is
approved by the
Board'.
<P>

<b>(d)	Page 2, Last Line</b>
<P>

Again, there is a reference to `free NRMA shares'.
<P>

<b>(e)	Page 3</b>
<P>

Each time the word `receive' is used, the words `will be entitled to' should be
inserted and again the references to the word `free'
where they appear should
be reconsidered.
<P>

<b>(f)	Page 4</b>
<P>

Again, the references to the word `free' need to be reconsidered.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>3.  <u>Brochure</u></b>
<P>

Again, generally speaking, the terms `free' and `at no cost' should perhaps be
reconsidered. We note in the brochure that a new
phrase `free of charge' tends
also to be used, sometimes prefixed by the adverb `absolutely'.
<P>

Secondly, the approach in drafting should be to emphasise entitlements rather
than making an absolute promise that parties will
be given shares or receive
shares."
<P>

630	The next drafts of the entitlements letters were sent to Mr Morgan on
6 May 1994.  The heading now referred to important news
"about the
proposal to give <u>you</u> free shares (of at least $ - ) in NRMA".  The
drafts now read, so far as material -
<P>

"In March it was announced that NRMA was considering a proposal to allow you
and others who were NRMA members as at the cut-off
date of March 16 1994 to
become shareholders, at no cost, in NRMA.
<P>

The purpose of this letter is to confirm that you will be entitled to receive
<b>at least $ - of NRMA shares</b> if the proposal goes ahead.
<P>

Long standing members will be entitled to receive more shares (up to twice as
many). And members who also had an insurance policy
with NRMA Insurance at the
cut-off date will also be entitled to additional shares.
<P>

The enclosed brochure explains more about this plan and about the members'
ballot to vote on the proposal later this year. (For
the proposal to go ahead,
75% of the members who vote will have to vote `Yes'.)
<P>

In the meantime it's important that we check our records to ensure that you
will receive your full entitlement to free shares if
the proposal is approved
by members."
<P>

631	The latest versions of the entitlements letters were sent to Mr Morgan
on 16 May 1994.  They showed substantial redrafting.
 They retained the
heading "Important news about the proposal to give you free shares (of at least
$ - ) in NRMA".  With one exception,
nothing in the body of the letters
referred to free shares or giving shares, and the notion of entitlement to
shares was used.  The
exception was that at the end of the letter there was a
reference, in connection with what would happen next, to future details of
"the
proposal to issue free NRMA shares".  The latest draft of the accompanying
brochure was sent to Mr Morgan at the same time.
 It referred to a
proposal to "offer shares free to members", and to a proposal that members
would "be given free" a minimum of $500
in shares.  In the section answering
members' questions appeared the question and answer, "Will I have to pay for
shares?" and "The
intention is that shares will be given to each member free of
charge".  Mr Morgan changed the words in the draft<i> </i>"offer shares free to
members" to "offer free shares", and changed the answer to the question to read
"... will be given free of charge".
 
<P>

632	The entitlements letters in their final form were approved by
Mr Simpson for AAH on 25 and 26 May 1994.  The heading remained.
 One
of the letters, intended for employees, had a first sentence referring to the
announcement in March that the NRMA "was investigating
issuing free shares to
employee members".  There were otherwise no references to free shares until the
reference to future details
of "the proposal to issue these free shares in NRMA
to you".
<P>

633	The NRMA placed some emphasis on the entitlements letters in these
proceedings, although I do not think they are critical to
my decision:  for
that reason, I have spent some time describing their drafting history.  There
were many changes in the course of
the drafting, and an emphasis on free shares
can be seen, apparently under the influence of Mr Mamutil or Mr Salvage.  It is
evident
that AAH accepted with a reservation the description of the shares to
be issued to members as free shares.  The reservation was not
that the shares
were not free because the members were giving up their rights.  It was that the
shares might not be free because
there was a possibility that an unsatisfactory
solution to the perceived capital gains tax difficulty meant, in the words of
Mr Morgan's
comment of 5 May 1994, that the NRMA "may have to fall back to
other methodologies to pay the shares up" - that is, maybe members
would have
to pay some money.  So expressions involving entitlement to receive shares,
proposal that the shares be free, or intention
that the shares be free, were
preferred, although far from consistently and not in strong terms.  The
reservation was not fully implemented.
<P>

634	The same approach can be seen in other external communications at this
time.  It is sufficient to give examples.  One is a letter
dated 9 May
1994 to Ms Parker, by which Mr Simpson conveyed AAH's approval to a
message from Mr Mackay to be printed in The Open
Road for June/July 1994.
The message included, "The NRMA belongs to the membership and the proposed
issuing of shares free is our
way of formalising that ownership and giving you
access to the financial wealth of the organisation".  Another is a draft letter
to be sent to NRMA "colleagues", approved by Mr Simpson on 1 June
1994.  It read -
<P>

"We are currently writing to all employees and members advising of their
eligibility for free shares in NRMA.
<P>

The proposal to list the NRMA on the Australian Stock Exchange and to issue
free shares will only proceed if it is approved by the
Board in August and
subsequently by members in October this year.
<P>

To be eligible for free shares as an employee or member, you need to have been
an NRMA employee or an NRMA member as at the cut-off
date of March 16, 1994.
<P>

Since you were employed after March 16, you will not be eligible for free
shares as an employee. However, if either you or your
spouse was an NRMA member
as at that date, you will receive a separate letter of eligibility shortly.
<P>

If there are any opportunities in the future to extend share ownership to all
employees, I will let you know.
<P>

In the meantime, if you do receive enquiries from customers about the proposal
to issue free shares, I would ask that you direct
them to contact the
<b>Members' Share Information Hotline</b>: 008 64 90 90, 8am to 8pm, Monday to
Friday.
<P>

Thank you for your efforts during this busy period."
<P>

It is plain that the NRMA wanted to convey to its members and employees the
message of free shares, in order to gain their support
for the proposal, and
much was left of that message in the entitlements letters and the brochure.
<P>

635	The entitlements letters, accompanied by brochures, were sent out on and
after 1 June 1994.  The perceived capital gains tax
difficulty had not then
been resolved.  It was not formally resolved until mid-August 1994, although by
late July 1994 communications
with the Taxation Office and the Treasurer had
brought confidence approaching certainty that an outcome satisfactory to the
NRMA
would be achieved.  So in the final drafting and settling of the
prospectus and the onsert there was not the same reservation as
in relation to
the entitlements letters.  Indeed, the prospectus and onsert would be speaking
of the final proposal, so the reservation
was not appropriate - if the capital
gains tax difficulty was not resolved, the proposal and so the prospectus and
onsert would have
to be changed.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed on the nature of a member's interest</b>
<P>

636	Mention of the capital gains tax difficulty brings attention back to the
development of the proposal in early April 1994, in
which the consideration for
the HoldCo shares was no longer money but was something more abstract.  The
corporations law problem,
that of paid-up shares, had been addressed by the
brief to Mr Heydon and the conference of 29 April 1994, but the perceived
capital
gains tax problem had not been addressed.
<P>

637	If the consideration for the issue of the shares was giving up membership
rights, what was being given up?  More specifically,
was what was being given
up proprietary in nature so that the taxation legislation would catch it?  The
question of the nature of
the member's interest in a company limited by
guarantee had been raised in Mr Shultz's papers on taxation issues, and had
been behind
the addendum to the brief to Mr Heydon of 25 January 1994.  While
the question of paid-up shares had involved Mr Heydon considering
whether
members' rights could be consideration, he was now asked to consider whether a
member had a proprietary interest in a company
limited by guarantee.
<P>

638	The framing of the question in that way seems to have flowed from
discussions with the Taxation Office.  An AAH memorandum dated
5 May 1994
recorded that the Taxation Office was concerned to identify "what do members
now have (is it an asset as defined in Section
160A?)", and Mr Morgan sent
to the Taxation Office a letter which included -
<P>

"We refer to our meeting on 3 May 1994 and set out below are our views on the
nature of a members interest in a company limited
by guarantee specifically, in
this case, NRMA Ltd (`Association') and NRMA Insurance Ltd (`Insurance').
<P>

These views have been confirmed by Dyson Heydon QC in conference.
<P>

<b>Nature of the members' Interest - generally</b>
<P>

The focus is on the type of interest or `property' which the member holds by
reason of membership. Both companies are constituted
as `limited liability'
companies and as such a member has no interest in the property or assets of the
company. That of course is
the same as the position for a shareholder. But what
`property' does the member have in the company itself?
<P>

In our view, the member's rights are accurately described as a `chose in
action', a well known form of personal property. This form
of property is the
same form of property that a person has as a party to a contract and it arises
essentially by reason of the fact
that by becoming a member the member thereby
becomes contractually bound to the company and to other members in accordance
with the
contract set forth in Section 180 of the Corporations Law. The member
has a bundle of rights under this contract. The member also
has obligations
under the contract. Under the Corporations Law the member also has other rights
and obligations. However, these rights
and obligations arise from statute and
are not strictly part of the property of the member."
<P>

The views were consistent with the AAH position from 1993, although the last
sentence in this extract is unclear.  The reference
to Mr Heydon's confirmation
of the views in conference must have been to discussion on 29 April 194 in the
context of paid-up shares.
 
<P>

639	Mr Morgan was nonetheless moved specifically to brief Mr Heydon.  He did so
by a brief dated 12 May 1994.  
<P>

640	The brief annexed a copy of AAH's letter to the NRMA of 4 November
1993, which had earlier been part of the brief to Mr Heydon
for the conference
of 14 December 1993.  The observations expressed Mr Morgan's view that the
nature of the member's interest was
that of a chose in action, setting out
reasons for that view.  The reasons included -
<P>

"9.6	I do not agree that members are merely agreeing to a variation of their
rights. They are clearly giving up one right (being
their membership) and
acquiring a new right (being a contract for the provision of services). This is
not a variation, it is a new
right and a new agreement.
<P>

...
<P>

9.12	I do not agree that a member has merely lost a right to vote unless it is
intended by this to suggest that a member has given
up one right (ie
membership) for another right (ie shares) and that, in an economic sense,
perhaps more accurately a layman's sense,
the rights are not similar under
each. There certainly is no reinstatement or enhancement of the existing right
of membership. More
pertinently, the voting right which is part of the bundle
of rights which forms the membership are not the only element of the property
held by the member and therefore I believe that it is inappropriate to single
out the voting rights for the purposes of determining
whether that is an asset
on the basis that, if it is determined it is not an asset, then the membership
is not an asset. It is also
again important to carefully note the point of time
at which the analysis is being made. The membership immediately prior to the
changeover date is at that point truly an enhanced right, that is, the existing
right of membership has been altered by the change
of status and the change in
the Articles of Association of the companies."
<P>

641	Mr Heydon was asked for his opinion "on the nature of the interest of a
member in a company limited by a guarantee".  It should
be noted that the
question addressed a company limited by guarantee in the abstract, not
Association or Insurance in particular,
and that Mr Heydon was not provided
with the memoranda and articles of Association and Insurance.  Copies of the
brief were sent
to Ms Conway, Ms Godwin and Mr Bateman.
<P>

642	The brief brought a written opinion from Mr Heydon dated 14 June
1994.  In substance Mr Heydon agreed with Mr Morgan.  He considered
that
although a member did not have a share, he did have a chose in action under the
contract found in the company's memorandum and
articles, and that the terms of
the contract could be enforced by injunction and declaration, possibly by an
action for damages,
and by relief from oppression.  The rights under the
contract were to attend meetings and vote, to a return of capital on a
winding-up,
and possibly to receive profits from the company's activities (it
should be remembered that Mr Heydon was advising as to companies
limited by
guarantee in the abstract).   He said that the worth of the members' rights was
preserved by s 180(3) of the Law, by which
the member could not be exposed by a
change in the company's constitution to increased liability to pay money to the
company.  The
opinion concluded -
<P>

"In short, the nature of the interest of a member in a company limited by
guarantee is that he has a chose in action the content
of which depends (apart
from the statutory rights he has under the Corporations Law) on the terms of
the memorandum and articles
of association of the company in question: the
memorandum and articles and the Corporations Law define his rights, and also
qualify
them by the duties they create."
<P>

<b>The onsert to late July 1994</b>
<P>

643<b>	</b>Mr Bateman had the principal concern with the onsert, it seems
because the onsert included the proxy forms and a particular area for
Mr
Bateman was the meetings.  In the period to late July 1994 he twice obtained Mr
Heydon's advice.  The group to which fell the
detailed consideration of the
onsert was the logistics working group.
<P>

644	I have referred to drafts of the proxy forms and acceptance of shares form
provided to Ms Godwin in February 1994.  Questions
arose in relation to the
wording of the proxy forms.  On 13 April 1994 Mrs Storrs wrote to Mr Bateman
asking him to "brief Queen's
Counsel on an urgent basis to provide advice as to
whether the form of proxy currently prescribed under Article 24 of the Articles
of Association of the Insurance company can be varied so as to conform with the
format currently used for NRMA Limited proxies".
 The articles of Association
did not provide for a form, but the articles of Insurance did, and one question
was whether the relevant
article was mandatory or directory.  Another question
was whether Insurance could issue a form of proxy making the chairman of the
meeting the residual proxy holder, providing in a particular way for how the
proxy holder was to vote, encouraging the appointment
of proxies, and giving
instructions as to completion.  
<P>

645	By a brief dated 22 April 1994 Mr Bateman asked Mr Heydon to advise on
those questions, and on the further question whether
the form of proxy in the
brief was "valid in the sense that if it were duly completed and lodged within
time it is not open to challenge".
 The form of proxy in the brief was for a
meeting of Insurance, and did not have an acceptance of shares form at its foot
or in any
way refer to free shares.  In a letter to Mr Heydon dated 28 April
1994 Mr Bateman added reference to and discussion of a case thought
to be
relevant, and provided the then current forms, being forms of proxy for
meetings of Association and Insurance and another page
providing for acceptance
of shares or cash.  The acceptance was quite different from the later
acceptance of shares at the foot of
the third page of the onsert, and did not
refer to the shares as free shares.  
<P>

646	In an opinion dated 3 May 1994 Mr Heydon advised that the article was
directory, that the other questions should be answered
in the affirmative
provided there was not inconsistency with the proxy form in the articles, and
that the form of proxy briefed was
valid.  
<P>

647	In late April 1994 Mrs Storrs raised a concern over giving notice of
meeting to a member of Insurance if the prospectus and
onsert package was
addressed to that person and another person as joint members of Association.
She consulted Ms Conway, who said
that Mr Bateman should be instructed to brief
Mr Heydon to advise in conference, with a written advice if it was then thought
desirable.
 A brief dated 11 May 1994 was delivered to Mr Heydon.  
<P>

648	A conference with Mr Heydon was held on 2 June 1994, those attending being
Mrs Storrs, Mr Simpson, and Mr Bateman;  it seems
that it had been intended
that Ms Conway would attend, but she did not.  Ways of overcoming the concern
were considered, one of which
was then adopted:  it is unnecessary to go into
the matter.  Written advice was not required.
<P>

649	Drafts of the onsert were prepared and considered, essentially limited to
proxies and whether the member wanted shares or cash.
 It will be recalled that
the terminology of Members Free Offer and Sale Offer was adopted for the
prospectus at the meeting of the
prospectus working group on 1 June 1994, and
the use of the language of free shares was taken up at a meeting of the
logistics working
group on the same day.  Mr Bateman said that the forms in the
onsert would need names.  Mrs Storrs said that the acceptance of shares
form
could be titled "Acceptance of Free Shares" and the proxies could be called
"Voting Papers".  She added that AAH had already
said it was all right to use
"free shares", and a little later Mr Stern said the same and that where the
onsert referred to shares
it would be free shares.  
<P>

650	As later described in relation to the prospectus, from early in June 1994
the input of Mr Barrett increased.  On 9 June 1994
Mr Hosking sent a memorandum
to those involved in the drafting of the onsert, including Mr Barrett, Mr
Morgan, and Mr Bateman, with
copies to Mr Rees, Ms Conway, Mr Mamutil, Ms
Godwin, and others within the NRMA, reading -
<P>

"<b>Subject:</b>  Onsert Forms Decision Making Process
<P>

The onsert forms are in a nearly complete state from the legal, technical and
design perspective.  The communications of the total
prospectus package should
now be considered. 
<P>

Adrian Rees requested that Sean Barrett now have overall responsibility for the
onsert forms.  Lisa Storrs is the NRMA representative
liaising with Sean.  Sean
reports to Adrian Rees.
<P>

Day-to-Day responsibility for the forms will be via Lisa."
<P>

651	The use of the title "Acceptance of Free Shares" seems to have been
confirmed at a meeting on 7 June 1994, with Mr Barrett's
imprimatur, and Mr
Barrett prepared a new draft of the onsert:  this must have been a product of
"overall responsibility for the
onsert forms" going to Mr Barrett, as conveyed
in the memorandum of 9 June 1994.  Mr Bateman's initial role in drafting both
the
prospectus and the onsert had now been taken away.  
<P>

652	Mr Barrett's draft of the onsert had a window for the particulars of the
addressee on a title page, the title being "Your personalised
voting pack for
the proposal to issue free shares in NRMA".  It then had a section stating that
it was proposed that NRMA "issue
free shares to members", drawing attention to
the proposed meetings and to the prospectus, and inviting completion of the
proxy form
and acceptance of free shares form if the member could not attend
the meetings and the acceptance of free shares form if the member
could attend.
The top of the next page provided for the member being told of entitlement to a
particular number of free shares. 
There followed a proxy form and an
acceptance of free shares form, in the latter case now entitled as such and
providing for the
member to say whether the free shares or the cash equivalent
was desired.  The language of free shares was thoroughly part of the
onsert.
<P>

653	The draft onsert was discussed at a meeting on 10 June 1994, attended
amongst others by Mr Rees, Ms Conway, Mrs Storrs, Mr Barrett,
Mr Morgan, and Mr
Bateman.  Mrs Storrs was now in a more prominent role in relation to the onsert
in the logistics working group.
 According to her note of the meeting - 
<P>

"Lisa Storrs raised the issue of legal challenge to this format on the
following bases:
<P>

1.	The term voting form or voting paper gives the impression that this is a
ballot form when in fact it's a document appointing
a proxy.
<P>

2.	We are going out on a limb anyway in changing the insurance proxy to further
change it by placing the chairman as the first option
as proxy (when in fact
the articles do not mention the chairman as a choice of proxy at all) could be
risky.
<P>

3.	She acknowledged that the members do not have to be given a proxy form at
all but since the articles do allow for it consideration
should be given to
provide a form favourable to members expectations.
<P>

Greg Bateman considered that the document was legally valid and that although
there could be a challenge it would only be of a true
risk if there was a
series of challenges on the meetings procedure and documentation format as a
whole.
<P>

He pointed out that the voting form in the "Sean" version should also have
reference to the proxy voting as he sees fit, if other
resolutions arise.  The
Association can put a form of proxy as it likes but there is still the problem
for the Insurance proxy which
is basically question 6 on the "Sean" version.
Greg Bateman to obtain QC's verbal advice on the risks associated with altering
the
form as per question 6."
<P>

It will be seen that the possible legal challenges were not concerned with the
references to free shares.
<P>

654	By a letter to Mr Heydon dated 10 June 1994 Mr Bateman asked for Mr
Heydon's opinion in conference.  He referred to the brief
of 22 April 1994 and
the opinion of 3 May 1994.  He enclosed Mr Barrett's version of the onsert,
saying that it would accompany the
prospectus to be despatched to members.  He
sought Mr Heydon's verbal assurance that the proxy forms, particularly that for
Insurance,
were "valid as to form".  In the discussion in the letter, Mr
Bateman expressed the view that the proxy forms "comply with elements
raised in
Counsel's written opinion", but drew to Mr Heydon's attention as areas which
might require consideration the description
of the forms, expressly or
impliedly, as voting forms; the appointment of the chairman before the
appointor's choice;  and the different
format from that normally used for
proxies.  
<P>

655	The opinion was given in a conference with Mr Heydon on 16 June 1994.  Mr
Morgan, Mr Simpson, and Mr Bateman were present, the
occasion for the
conference being Mr Morgan's brief of 10 June 1994 concerning goodwill later
mentioned.  Although the conference
had been arranged in connection with the
question of goodwill, Mr Bateman being present, it extended to the question of
the proxy
forms.  
<P>

656	Restricting present attention to the advice concerning the proxy forms,
only Mr Bateman had a meaningful note of the conference.
 Recollections were
limited.  
<P>

657	Mr Bateman's note indicated that Mr Heydon considered that the proxy forms
would be marginally improved by adding to the description
of "voting paper"
words such as "for proxy voting", and that Mr Heydon was not concerned about
what was noted as "appt of chairman
first" and "format".  Mr Bateman's evidence
included that Mr Heydon did not express any concern about the references to
free shares,
and no one else present suggested that he did.  According to Mr
Heydon, nothing was asked of him or said by him about free shares,
he was asked
specific matters about the proxy forms none of which related to the use of that
expression, and he did not turn his
mind to it.  None of Mr Morgan, Mr Simpson
and Mr Bateman suggested that there was reference at all to free shares, and I
accept
that there was not.  
<P>

658	Mr Bateman telephoned Ms Godwin, who must have been made aware of the
matters raised by Mrs Storrs, and passed on the advice
about the proxy forms.
After the conference Mr Heydon telephoned Mr Bateman and said that, on
further reflection, his opinion of
3 May 1994 was incorrect in so far as
he had said that the appointor did not have to be given a possible proxy other
than the chairman,
and that the appointor should be given the option of
appointing the chairman or someone else:  Mr Bateman's note included,
"This
could also be achieved by some asterisk or note".  Mr Heydon had really
not said that the appointor did not have to be given a possible
proxy other
than the chairman, and this seems to have been an excess of caution.  The
overall result was recorded by Mrs Storrs in
a file note -
<P>

"<u>Attending Greg Bateman on the phone</u>. He advised Dyson Hayden [sic]
concerning the NRMA Insurance proxy form as follows:
<P>

1.	No problem with the format
<P>

2.	No problem with the Chairman being named first
<P>

3.	Marginal risk with having a reference to a voting paper rather than a proxy.
This could be overcome by calling it a proxy voting
paper or having in brackets
under voting the words `for proxy voting'.
<P>

	The main problem is that the Insurance proxy has to provide for two open
appointments. At this stage we have taken up one of those
appointments by
naming the Chairman. It would be preferable to have two open appointments if we
are also going to name the Chairman."
<P>

659	Amendments to the onsert to give effect to the advice were agreed at a
meeting of the logistics working group on 16 June 1994.
 
<P>

660	Mrs Storrs raised with Mr Bateman on 17 June 1994 whether
Mr Heydon should "put his changed thinking on the proxy form in writing",
and Mr Bateman replied (according to Mrs Storrs' file note) that "he
didn't think it would be worthwhile instead we should get a
final sign-off on
the package of forms, prospectus, notice of meeting etc".  The NRMA placed some
reliance on the undoubted fact
that, if it was intended at this time, no "final
sign-off on the package of forms, prospectus, notice of meeting etc" was
obtained
from Mr Heydon.  As will be seen, however, circumstances changed, and
the defendants said that Ms Conway in substance determined
that Mr Heydon
should not have this final involvement.  Instead, there were the sign-offs by
AAH and AT.
<P>

661	According to a file note made by Mrs Storrs, in a telephone conversation
with Mr Bateman on 28 June 1994 dealing with various
aspects of the onsert, Mr
Bateman said he thought there should be "extra wording in the instruction sheet
saying that the resolution
to issue free shares should actually be elaborated
upon by reference to the prospectus or notice of meeting".  The instruction
sheet
must have been the second page of the onsert.  Its then form is not clear
on the evidence, and the note is not entirely clear, but
Mr Bateman seems to
have wanted the reader of the onsert to be referred specifically to the
resolutions in the prospectus.  Mrs Storrs'
note recorded her reply that "the
issue of referring to the resolutions in the prospectus had been included in a
test format and
that I would ring him and give him the wording as changed by
Sean Barrett".  This indicates Mr Barrett's significant role in the
drafting.
The onsert in its final form did say that "details about the proposed
resolutions and the reason for the Boards' recommendations
are explained in the
enclosed prospectus".
<P>

662	As what I have just recounted reflects, the onsert had been tested in
market research, for comprehension and proper completion,
and had been altered
from its earlier form.  A detailed "customer research report" was prepared in
early July 1994, indicating that
the first version tested had many problems,
that a second version was developed, and that while the second version had
problems they
could be overcome by applying some form design standards
previously neglected.  By 6 July 1994 the onsert had reached what was thought
to be its final form.  
<P>

663	The following description of the onsert for situation 3 members may be
compared with the copy of the onsert in appendix 1. 
Later in these reasons the
changes after 6 July 1994 will be traced through.
<P>

664	The first page had the window for the particulars of the member and the
"Share the Future" logo.  Towards the top it said prominently,
"Important
Information Inside".  Beneath that and to the right of the logo were the words
"How to vote!" and beneath them the words
"How many FREE shares you will get!".
In the bottom right hand corner, with a symbolic turning page, was said, "There
is more information
on the back of this page".  
<P>

665	On the second page, the back of the first leaf, was the same logo and the
text -
<P>

"<b>What the enclosed form is and why you should fill it in</b>
<P>

It is proposed that NRMA change its current status and issue free shares to
members. The NRMA Board are recommending that you vote
in favour of this and
take shares rather than cash.  Details about the proposed resolution and the
reasons for the Board's recommendations
are explained in the enclosed
Prospectus.
<P>

There are two meetings - one for NRMA Limited starting at 10:00 am and the
other for NRMA Insurance Limited starting at 3.30 pm
- to be held on Wednesday,
October 12, 1994 at the Royal Agricultural Society Showground, Sydney.
<P>

The enclosed form is very important. It allows you to appoint someone to vote
for you if you are not going to the meetings. This
person is called a proxy.
The form also allows you to tell us now if you want to take the free shares or
a cash alternative.

<P>

666	The top two-thirds of the third page provided alternative proxy voting

<P>

667	The fourth page contained proxy voting forms for Insurance. 
<P>

668	Mr Bateman returned to Mr Heydon with this version of the onsert.  On 6
July 1994 he went through the changes to the onsert
with Mrs Storrs, and it
must be that either he suggested or she instructed the return.  
<P>

669	On that day Mr Bateman wrote to Mr Heydon -
<P>

"We refer to:
<P>

(a)	 our Brief of 22 April 1994;
<P>

(b)	Counsel's written opinion in response dated 3 May 1994 a copy of which is
<u>enclosed</u> for your reference; and
<P>

(c)	our telephone call of 16 June 1994 (following our conference with you).
<P>

<u>Enclosed</u> is the final version of the `onsert' which is the loose
material which would accompany the Prospectus to be despatched to each member
of NRMA Limited.
<P>

This onsert addresses the most common situation where the member of NRMA
Limited is also a member of NRMA Insurance Limited. The
personalised
information of the membership name and address will appear at the top of the
relevant Proxy Paper.
<P>

As a matter of information, the Proxy Paper and instruction sheet will be
adapted to meet the circumstances of each member's situation
with, for example,
multiple Proxy Papers for NRMA Insurance Limited where multiple membership
exist.
<P>

We believe that the enclosed forms of `Voting Paper' meets all the concerns
previously canvassed.
<P>

Our client is about to commence production of these and would, therefore, like
your written confirmation that the proposed Voting
Paper for each of NRMA
Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited is valid as to form."
<P>

670	The enclosure was the full onsert in the 8 July 1994 version, which does
not sit well with a letter of 6 July 1994, but for
present purposes the
differences from the 6 July 1994 version do not matter.  From the history, in
his reference to the "Voting Paper"
Mr Bateman must have meant the proxy forms,
both because the earlier briefs to and conferences with Mr Heydon had been
concerned
only with the proxy forms and because the balance of the onsert was
not appropriately described in that manner.
<P>

671	The onsert was given some further attention, mainly in matters of detail,
over the next few days.  Mrs Storrs had the immediate
responsibility for its
finalisation within the NRMA.  In a file note dated 8 July 1994 she
recorded, "There is to be no other changes
[sic] to the onsert forms other than
those forced by legal circumstances.  All changes are only to be done by Lisa
Storrs with legal
sign-off by Greg Bateman.  Lisa Storrs is still awaiting QC's
advice on sign-off."  
<P>

672	It is apparent that Mr Morgan also considered what was thought to be
the final form of the onsert, since on 8 July 1994 he recorded
some
questions and suggested amendments as to the detail.  One of his suggestions
was that onsert should include a statement that
it was issued with the
prospectus and "Before completing these forms, you should read the prospectus
carefully";  this has links
with Mr Bateman's earlier desire that the reader be
referred to the resolutions, and was taken up by the addition of a marginal
note
at the bottom left-hand corner of the first page reading, "This document,
the Proxy Voting Papers and Acceptance of Free Shares,
is issued with the
prospectus by NRMA Holdings Limited and Perpetual Trustee Company Limited dated
XX August 1994.  <u>Before completing these forms, you should read the
Prospectus carefully</u>."  With minor changes, this carried forward to the
onsert in its final form, see Appendix 1.
<P>

673	Mr Heydon responded to the letter of 6 July 1994 in an opinion dated
20 July 1994.  He recorded that he was "asked to comment
on the formal
validity of two voting papers headed Form C and Form D and dated 8 July
1994", they being the proxy voting forms in
the onsert.  As to the form for
Association, he said it appeared to comply with the articles, which provided
that the form could
be determined by the directors.  Identifying what he
described as two particular points, he expressed the view that it was
consistent
with that  to make the chairman proxy if the members accidentally
chose two proxies and that a member could amend the form to deal
with the
impact of other votes.  As to the form for Insurance, he said that it also
appeared to comply with the articles and that,
as earlier advised, the form set
out in the articles of Insurance was directory not mandatory and did not
preclude the additional,
but not inconsistent, material in the form:  that
material was permissible, and if the member did not like it he could amend or
delete
it.
<P>

674	So as at 20 July 1994 the onsert appeared to be acceptable.  Under the
impetus of Mr Barrett, but without adverse comment by
Mr Morgan or Mr Bateman,
it contained the emphasis and attraction of free shares on the first page and a
number of references to
free shares thereafter.  Although there had been
reference to a sign-off by Mr Heydon, he had only been asked about the proxy
voting
forms and about their validity as to form.  He had not been asked for an
opinion about the references to free shares, and had not
given any such
opinion.  
<P>

675	The restricted scope of the inquiry into the formal validity of the proxy
voting forms must have been emphasised when, on 20
July 1994, Mr Bateman wrote
to Mrs Storrs noting that there were different versions of the onsert according
to entitlements and asking
that the other versions be made available:  he also
said that the NRMA "must check with John Morgan of Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley
that he is also satisfied with the document as he must deal with the matter
from a prospectus, lodgment and compliance point of view".
 
<P>

676	But on 21 July 1994 there was a complication - see below as to Ms
Singleton's query.
<P>

<b>The goodwill question</b>
<P>

677	The goodwill question had two aspects.  Mr Heydon advised on one of the
aspects.  The goodwill question itself, in either of
its aspects, was far from
central to these proceedings.  It seems to have been gone into because it
showed consideration and appreciation,
quite close to August 1994, of
membership rights being legal property;  of giving up membership rights;  and
of membership rights
having value to the holding company in the sense that
giving them up increased the value of its shares in Association and Insurance.
And it was said that Mr Heydon's further attention to the value of membership
rights underlay his important advice about free shares
in early August 1994, to
which I will shortly come.
<P>

678	The starting point of the first aspect was for present purposes a matter
raised by C&amp; L in March 1994.  The holding company
would acquire the NRMA.
C&amp;L said that application of Accounting Standard AASB1015, dealing with
acquisitions accounting, had
the effect that the goodwill represented by the
excess of the value of the NRMA over the fair value of its identifiable net
assets
should be reflected in the balance sheet and amortised by a charge
against profits on a systematic basis over a period of years.
 In April 1994 Mr
Bateman was asked whether he agreed, and "whether there are any other avenues
of dealing with the problem".  
<P>

679	In the letter of 28 April 1994, earlier referred to as the source of a
description of the proposal in its then form, Mr Bateman
said that he agreed
with C&amp;L, and canvassed possible ways of reducing or eliminating the
goodwill element.  One way, which he
rejected, was a technical argument that
there was no acquisition.  Another was bringing to account and/or revaluing
intangible assets.
 Another involved reducing the share premium account.
Finally, relief from AASB1015 could be sought.
<P>

680	Mr Bateman and Mr Pearce discussed this on 5 May 1994.  A copy of Mr
Bateman's letter of 28 April 1994 was provided to C&amp;L,
and C&amp;L prepared
a paper on whether AASB1015 applied to the restructuring and sent it to Mr
Bateman on 10 May 1994.  The conclusion
in the paper was that it was a very
complex question and required further research.  
<P>

681	A meeting took place between Mr Pearce, Mr Lynn, Mr Tony Wehby also of
C&amp;L, and Mr Bateman on 11 May 1994, and another meeting
 took place between
Mr Pearce, a Ms Bridget Curran (probably of C&amp;L), Mr Barry, Ms Birch, Mr
Lynn, Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman
on 31 May 1994, both considering the treatment
of goodwill.
<P>

682	C&amp;L prepared a draft paper for submission to the ASC seeking relief
from AASB1015.  It was necessary to address what the
holding company would
acquire, and the draft said that it would acquire "voting rights rather than
shares".  
<P>

683	Mr Morgan commented on the paper, suggesting that it needed more work, and
his comments included -
<P>

"In paragraph 16, the reference to voting rights is technically too narrow and
I am not sure in any case that it ought to be said
that the membership rights,
which include the voting rights, are being acquired.  Rather, as a technical
matter, Members are agreeing
to give up their membership rights with the
consequence that the membership of the Holding Company is increased in value.
I would
suggest that this point is, in fact, important and we should be
suggesting that this fact of itself may render the standard inapplicable.
 This
needs also to be reflected in paragraph 19.  There is no doubt that the value
of the voting right and the value of the membership
of Holding Company  is
enhanced by the Members giving up their interest."
<P>

So the argument previously rejected, that there was no acquisition within
AASB1015, was revived.
<P>

684	It was then decided, at a meeting on 10 June 1994 between Mr Pearce, Mr
Wehby, Ms Curran, and Mr Bateman, that "a QC's opinion
should be obtained", and
that the application to the ASC would not be pursued if the opinion made it
unnecessary.  
<P>

685	On 14 June 1994 Mr Bateman prepared a draft brief to Mr Heydon requesting a
written opinion - 
<P>

" ...  as to -
<P>

(a)	whether HoldCo acquires an asset, within the terms of AASB1015, on the
Changeover Date;
<P>

(b)	if it does, what is that asset;  and
<P>

(c)	whether AASB1015.20 applies to HoldCo in relation to the events proposed
for HoldCo in relation to each of the Association and
Insurance on the
Changeover Date."
<P>

The observations in the draft brief contained a detailed consideration of the
matters for opinion, and AT's view that AASB1015 did
not apply to the proposed
restructuring because the holding company would not acquire Association or
Insurance in any of the ways
to which it referred.  Mr Bateman had modified his
earlier view.  
<P>

686	Mr Bateman sent the draft to Mr Morgan.  Looking ahead for a moment, in the
result Mr Heydon was not briefed to advise on this
aspect of the goodwill
question.
<P>

687	The second aspect of the goodwill question was of later origin than the
first, and came to a head at this time.  
<P>

688	As attention was given to drafting, amongst other articles, the so-called
"change-over article" whereby members of Association
and Insurance would cease
to be members on condition that the new holding company issued shares to them,
further thought was given
to s 191 of the Law requiring transfer to a share
premium account of a premium on the issue of shares.  The draft change-over
article
took what was called the "Transfer Value" of each of Association and
Insurance, meaning the value of each company and its subsidiaries,
and the
condition included that Holdings would apply the Transfer Value to pay up the
par value of the shares to be issued and then
credit the balance to a share
premium account.  
<P>

689	It was thought necessary to explore the application of s 191 to this
situation.  Mr Morgan prepared a brief for Mr Heydon to
advise on the impact of
s 191.  
<P>

690	Early in the observations in the brief Mr Morgan said -
<P>

"Senior Counsel has previously advised that the proposed restructuring would
allow NRMA Holdings Limited to issue shares fully paid
up by reason of the
consideration or transfer of value from members to the holding company.  To the
extent that the transfer of value
was greater than the amount required to pay
up the shares the balance would be credited to a share premium account.  We had
not previously
fully examined the implications of Section 191 and the matters
now raised are a pre-cursor to issues arising in relation to the application
of
the accounting standards relating to goodwill."
<P>

691	It was then said that the proposed restructuring was "outlined in section
of the draft prospectus which is briefed", and in
a few sentences a summary was
given.  The section of the draft prospectus was the then draft of what became
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a>, dealing with the Members Free Offer and the Sale Offer and referring
to receipt of shares at no cost, but not referring to free
shares or using the
capitalised phrase Free Shares.  
<P>

692	There was reference to the proposed change-over article.  It was proposed
that the Transfer Value be an agreed value, but the
observations raised whether
the amount to be credited to the share premium account after allowing for the
amount required to pay
up the shares to be issued had to reflect the difference
between the net tangible assets of the NRMA and a fair market value, that
is, a
goodwill amount.  There was reference to an opinion of Mr Bryan Beaumont QC in
a different corporate transaction.  
<P>

693	Mr Heydon was asked to advise -
<P>

"(a)	in the case contemplated does Section 191 require the benefit transferred
to NRMA Holdings Limited to be brought to account
as share premium to the
extent that it is not applied to pay up the shares issued by the company;  and

<P>

(b)	if the answer to that question is yes, what is the basis of the valuation
which directors should apply for the purposes of determining
the amount of
share premium to be brought to account."
<P>

694	The brief was ultimately dated 16 June 1994, and seems to have been
delivered at a conference on that day arranged by Mr Morgan,
being the
conference earlier mentioned at which there was advice concerning the proxy
forms.  Mr Bateman had not seen the brief before
the conference.  
<P>

695	Mr Morgan's note of the conference simply said "191 applic", and Mr
Morgan's recollection was that the only matter discussed
was the application of
s 191 of the Law.  Mr Bateman's note of the conference included, after a
reference to s 191, "Beaumont is
wrong.  Any form of valuable consideration
will suffice.  The <i>Henry Head case</i> was not to be taken to be restricted
to physical assets.  Goodwill is part of what is rec'ed."  In short, Mr Heydon
advised that
s 191 applied.  Nothing was said about oppression or the use of
the label Members Free Offer.
<P>

696	The perceived precursor to the application of AASB1015 therefore left alive
the first aspect of the goodwill question:  s 191
required that the goodwill be
brought to account.  So attention returned to Mr Bateman's draft brief of 14
June 1994, but Mr Morgan
continued to focus on the effect of s 191 and the two
aspects continued in tandem.
<P>

697	Mr Morgan wrote to Mr Bateman on 23 June, suggesting additions and
alterations to Mr Bateman's draft brief of 14 June 1994 and
in part reagitating
the issue of a share premium account.  
<P>

698	He took a rather different view from Mr Bateman's recent view on whether
AASB1015 would apply, this time a modification in Mr
Morgan's view.  Mr Morgan
suggested an additional paragraph concerning previous advice, clearly referable
to the advice of 16 June
1994 and evidencing what Mr Heydon had advised - 
<P>

"Senior Counsel has previously advised that for the purposes of Section 191 of
the Corporations Law HoldCo will receive valuable
consideration by way of  an
increase in the value of its membership, but that valuable consideration may be
applied to pay up shares
to be issued by HoldCo and to the extent that the
valuable consideration exceeds the amount applied to pay up the shares that
consideration
represents a premium and the premium must be applied to the share
premium account.  Therefore, the capital of the company will consist
of paid-up
capital together with a share premium which will be represented by assets in
HoldCo being that company's assets including
the investments in the
subsidiaries of which HoldCo is now the member."
<P>

699	A number of changes to the observations were then suggested, including
deleting parts of the draft because Mr Heydon had already
advised "that a
membership constitutes a chose in action which is legal property" and that the
holding company "does receive valuable
consideration for the purposes of
section 191".  Notwithstanding this, Mr Morgan suggested that a question be
added which seemed
to reagitate the earlier advice, namely - 
<P>

"If Senior Counsel concludes that HoldCo does not acquire an asset does Senior
Counsel confirm that nevertheless HoldCo receives
valuable consideration that
can be applied in paying up the shares to be issued by HoldCo and that in so
doing HoldCo receives a
premium constituted by that valuable consideration for
the purposes of section 191."
<P>

700	On the first aspect of the goodwill question, Mr Morgan concluded his
letter -
<P>

"As you can see the principal problem we have turns on the operation of a
change over article and whether or not at the change over
date the members have
acquired the valuable rights constituted by the right to receive dividends and
the right to receive the assets
on the winding up. In our initial consideration
of the tax law position we believed it was important that that be done and it
remains
important depending upon the way in which the tax relief which is being
sought is granted. We understand we will receive from the
ATO a paper on Friday
this week setting out their approach and this may give us some better guidance
as to whether or not this concern
remains. One possible approach to deal with
the matter would be to put to Senior Counsel two alternative change over
articles. One
operating in the way that you have suggested that is, it operates
contemporaneously with the change in the articles so that membership
in effect
ceases at the same time as the articles change and secondly in the way which we
have drafted the current change over article.
<P>

However whichever way it is approached we have a fundamental concern with the
suggestion contained in the brief that the existing
rights of members do not
constitute legal property. This is clearly the advice previously given by
Senior Counsel and therefore we
suggest the only real argument which is open is
whether or not as a matter of construction those rights constitute an asset
solely
for the purposes of the accounting standards. Looking at the matter from
the point of view of the member surely this means the member's
membership in
either case has no service potential or future economic benefit which is
controlled by the member as a result of the
acquisition of the membership.
Although the service potential or future economic benefit may be small it is
nevertheless present
in our view and we find great difficulty with the argument
that it is not present.
<P>

Quite frankly I believe the arguments are not persuasive in this regard and I
believe the arguments based on the fact that notwithstanding
it is an asset in
the above sense it is not an asset that possesses a cost or other value that
can be measured reliably and the arguments
in paragraphs 11 and following are
far more persuasive."
<P>

701	Mr Morgan summarised his thinking in another letter to
Mr Bateman, copied to Mr Wehby, dated 23 June 1994.  The letter
included
-
<P>

"I also think it is important if we go to Heydon that we do not confuse any of
the issues by raising unnecessary matters but rather
try to focus on what our
argument really is. My suggestion is that our argument is this:
<P>

1.	There is a transfer of a benefit from members to the Holding Company in the
form of valuable consideration.
<P>

2.	For the purposes of Section 191, the Holding Company receives valuable
consideration through its existing membership and that
consideration is
received by way of the increase in the value of its membership.
<P>

3.	The members give up their membership. The membership is legal property in
the form of a chose in action. The legal property is
dealt with in two parts.
Firstly, the right to road service is compensated by a payment to the member of
the unexpired portion of
the road service fee and that is applied to create the
new contract between the company and the member and the balance of the chose
in
action is in effect cancelled. Most importantly, the chose in action, ie the
legal asset, is not transferred to the Holding Company.
<P>

4.	Since the member is not transferring any legal property to the Holding
Company, there is no acquisition of legal property by
the Holding Company.
<P>

5.	The question then is, is the receipt of the consideration nevertheless an
acquisition of an asset for accounting purposes? That
gives rise to two
questions:
<P>

(i)	is the valuable consideration received an accounting asset; and
<P>

(ii)	is the receipt an acquisition in accounting terms?"
<P>

702	There was a discussion on 23 June 1994 attended by Mr Pearce, Ms Birch, Mr
Lynn, Mr Wehby, Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman.  On 29
June 1994 Mr Bateman prepared
a revised draft of his brief to Mr Heydon, a draft which did not take up the
matters in Mr Morgan's
letter of 23 June 1994.  In sending a copy of the draft
to Mr Pearce, Mr Bateman said he was awaiting material from Mr Morgan to
add to
the brief.  
<P>

703	However, the brief was never delivered.  The matters seen as requiring
advice seem to have been worked out at a meeting between
Mr Pearce, Mr Lynn and
Mr Bateman on 30 June 1994, or at least Mr Bateman was then instructed not to
proceed with the brief, to accept
that AASB1015 applied, and to seek relief
from the ASC.  
<P>

704	Mr Morgan then returned to Mr Heydon in connection with the share premium
account.  In a brief to Mr Heydon dated 24 July 1994
he referred to the brief
of 16 June 1994 and subsequent conference, said that there had been raised the
question of the basis on
which the value of the premium would be determined,
and stated that he wished "to pursue that matter further".  In the observations
he suggested different approaches to valuation, considered case law, and
expressed the tentative view that it was a matter for the
directors to
determine a valuation and that, so long as the directors were able to make the
determination honestly and on a proper
basis, it ordinarily could not be
attacked.  He ended, "We wish to discuss with you in conference the matters
pertinent to this valuation
issue".  
<P>

705	Mr Morgan conferred with Mr Heydon on 26 July 1994.  Mr Pearce and Mr Barry
were present, but Mr Bateman was not present.  Mr
Heydon had a note of the
conference, obscure but consistent with what Mr Morgan later conveyed as the
advice.  Mr Morgan had a more
extensive note of the conference, showing that
there was lengthy discussion but difficult to translate to an account of the
discussion.
 Neither had significant independent recollection of the
conference.
<P>

706	The essence of Mr Heydon's advice can be found in what Mr Morgan passed on
to others after the conference.  Later on 26 July
1994, at a meeting attended
amongst others by Mr Pearce and Mr Bateman, Mr Morgan said that Mr Heydon had
advised that s 191 "operates
on the basis that you look down, that is, you look
at the value of what is being received, rather than what is being given up".
The
effect was that any goodwill, after the directors' valuation, had to be
brought to account.  Still later on the same day, a meeting
was held with the
ASC, and the NRMA applied to the ASC for relief from AASB1015.  There was no
reference in the conference to free
shares.
<P>

707	To return to why the goodwill question was gone into in these proceedings,
some of the defendants seemed to say that it supported
that membership rights
were seen as not being of value, in the sense that the rights of individual
members were in reality valueless
although giving up the collective membership
rights increased the value of the holding company's share or shares in
Association and
Insurance.  Mr Bateman gave evidence of telling a meeting at
the ASC why membership of Association and Insurance was not worth anything,
and
it was suggested that the distinction between looking at the value of what is
received, rather than what is being given up, was
here significant.  Mr
Bateman's evidence took this up when addressing whether the shares in the
holding company could properly be
described as free shares.
<P>

<b>Further drafting of the prospectus </b>
<P>

708	The prospectus working group met on 31 May 1994.  Shortly before the
meeting Mr Rees told Mr Bateman that he was not happy with
Mr Bateman's draft
of the explanatory statement, saying that it was too long and too complicated
and members would not understand
it.  According to Mr Bateman, Mr Rees told him
not to do any more work on it, and said that he had asked Mr Barrett to provide
a
fresh draft;  when Mr Bateman explained that he had made his draft
appropriate for editing, Mr Rees said that he wanted a new approach.
 According
to Mr Rees it was put slightly differently, in that he said that he would ask
Mr Barrett to put the draft into more simple
language, that Mr Barrett was
ideal for the job because he was an expert in the use of plain English to
convey complex or legal concepts,
and that once Mr Barrett had done a redraft
the prospectus working group could consider it again.  The meeting which
followed dealt
with other sections of the draft prospectus.
<P>

709	At the meeting of the prospectus working group on 1 June 1994 Mr Bateman
provided notes of a number of issues which he thought
should be considered for
inclusion in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a>, and he read them out.  Mr Rees said that they were
taken on board and would be looked at, and repeated that he thought that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> needed a new approach and that he had asked Mr Barrett to take it
over.  
<P>

710	The then draft of the prospectus, designated version 3, was distributed to
the members of the due diligence committee on 3 June
1994.  Its preliminary
nature was emphasised.  Some comments were received for consideration at a
meeting of the prospectus working
group on 8 June 1994.  
<P>

711	By the meeting of 8 June 1994 Mr Barrett had not produced a fresh draft of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a>, but BT had provided its own outline of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> for discussion.
Present at the meeting were Mr Rees, Mr Hosking, Ms Godwin,
Mr Barry, Ms  Birch, Mr Stern, Mr Morgan, and
Mr Bateman.
 
<P>

712	The record of the meeting reflected considerable discussion of the drafting
of the prospectus.  It read -
<P>

"<b>Comments:</b>
<P>

*	Members need to know what they are being asked to do.
<P>

*	Require informed consent - fair view of the issues.
<P>

*	Set out the steps of the consequences of voting yes.
<P>

*	The Boards of Association and Insurance are presenting the Information for
Members section.
<P>

*	Care with cross referencing between the Information for Members and the
Prospectus from the perspective of which company is making
the statement.
<P>

*	There are 2 meetings. Are there issues relevant to one that are not relevant
to the other meetings?
<P>

*	Members approval sought in relation to the major sections which are necessary
for inclusion in the Information for Members. In
particular paragraph 12 -
Outline of Resolutions, paragraph 15 - Entitlements and paragraph 6 - Proposed
Structure of the draft dated
1 June 1994 require members approval.
<P>

*	Focus on the positives of the new structure and its benefits. Don't focus on
the negatives of the old structure.
<P>

*	Diagram to be included in the front section detailing `relationships'. Look
to Sean Barrett of Rowlands for input.
<P>

*	The Service Membership rights for Road Service are available upon request by
members.
<P>

*	The context in which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> Information for Members is written is to be
discussed with Sean Barrett (eg personal vs third party).

<P>

	-  advocacy role;
<P>

	-  one vote per share;
<P>

<P>

	-  premiums and membership fees won't be reduced; and
<P>

	   guarantee company structure (one sentence only).
<P>

*	Pooling of profits between Association and Insurance are to be addressed.
<P>

*	Pru Godwin to redraft <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> for circulation and review at the meeting on
Tuesday, 14 June 1994."
<P>

713	Mr Bateman's note of the meeting (the evidence did not include a note
by Mr Morgan) included, "What other alternatives are there:
 scale back to
we looked at others, &amp; say no more".
<P>

714	According to Mr Morgan, Mr Rees said that the draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> prepared
by Mr Bateman was not what was wanted, it was too long and too legalistic and
not the sort of thing that the members would
understand, and "I'll go away and
we'll redraft it and present a new document".  From the record of the meeting,
the situation had
now been arrived at that Ms Godwin was to prepare a fresh
draft with input from Mr Barrett.  
<P>

715	The input from Mr Barrett, however, was to be considerable.  According to
Mr Barrett, at about this time Mr Rees told him that
the AT draft was too long
and complicated and asked him (Mr Barrett) to consider it and see if it could
be simplified and turned
into plain language.  Mr Rees did say that he should
"liaise with Greg Bateman on the legal aspect of this part of the prospectus
because it has many legal ramifications".  Mr Rees gave the blunt evidence that
he "asked Mr Barrett to go away and try to translate
the complex legal and
technical matters in there into simpler English".  Mr Hosking wrote a note to
Mr Rees stating that the then
introductory section generally describing the
prospectus and the proposed meetings needed a lot of work "and should be driven
by
Sean", and this was in line with Mr Rees' actions. 
<P>

716	The next version of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus, a draft dated
16 June 1994, differed quite considerably from Mr Bateman's draft.  It
must have been prepared by
Ms Godwin or Mr Barrett.  Its early parts were under
the headings "What are members being asked to do?", "The proposed structure",
"Time of change-over from present structure to proposed structure", "How are
the Free Shares being allocated", "How does the Share
Offer work and where does
the cash come from?", and "When will members receive their Free Shares?".  It
made frequent but inconsistent
use of the capitalised phrase Free Shares to
denote the shares to be issued to members.  As I have said, the final step to
use of
this phrase was unclear.
<P>

717	The part of the draft most directly dealing with advantages and
disadvantages should be compared with Mr Bateman's draft.  It
now read -
<P>

"<b>WHAT ARE THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE PROPOSAL?</b>
<P>

<b>1.	Why is the Proposal the best alternative?</b>
<P>

Members will have a direct ownership stake in the NRMA and the opportunity to
share directly in what Directors believe will be the
future success of the
NRMA.
<P>

	`Direct ownership' means that:
<P>

*	it is the Member (who is now the shareholder) who will receive dividends
which the Company pays. Dividends come from profits and
under the present
structure it is extremely difficult to distribute profits directly to
Members.
<P>

*	as the value of the NRMA increases so does the value of the Member's (who is
now the shareholder) Shares. In other words the Member's
asset increases in
value.
<P>

*	the Member can increase his or her level of ownership in the NRMA, something
which is not possible under the current structure.
<P>

*	if the Member (who is now the shareholder) chooses he or she can convert
their ownership of the NRMA into cash. Again this is
not possible under the
current structure.
<P>

*	the tax paid by NRMA on its profits can be used to make any dividends paid
tax free to some extent, through the `franking' of
the dividends.
<P>

*	Members will have more incentive to participate in the governance of the
NRMA.
<P>

<b>2.	What is wrong with the present structure?</b>
<P>

The problems which the NRMA faces because of its present structure are:
<P>

*	Members do not have direct access to the financial success of the NRMA.
Sharing that success is solely in the hands of the management
of the NRMA not
in the hands of Members.
<P>

*	Members have little incentive to participate in the governance of the NRMA.
This is shown by the very low number of members who
vote in NRMA elections. In
1993 only ___ of 1.8 million Members voted.
<P>

*	There is no protection against a takeover. A takeover under the present
structure may take slightly longer but the person wishing
to takeover the NRMA
would not even have to pay Members for it.
<P>

*	Continued rebates (or price cuts are destabilising. First, they encourage
rapid growth in market share as people seek to benefit
from the reductions.
Then when the reductions can no longer be maintained and prices rise, the NRMA
would be vulnerable to consumer
reaction (criticism and loss of business) and
possibly government intervention.
<P>

<b>3.	What other alternatives were considered and why can't we vote on them
too?</b>
<P>

The Directors considered a number of alternatives which can be summarised
as:
<P>

*	do nothing
<P>

*	reduce premiums and membership fees
<P>

*	only convert part of the NRMA to a company limited by shares and list that
part on the Stock Exchange.
<P>

The disadvantages connected with the first two of these alternatives are
examined under the headings <b>What's Wrong with the Present Structure</b> and
<b>Why not charge less for insurance and Road Service?</b>
<P>

	The third alternative has the following disadvantages:
<P>

*	control of the NRMA name becomes more difficult
<P>

*	fragmentation of the NRMA into parts could destroy the value of the NRMA over
time
<P>

*	the possibility of disunity of the public face of the NRMA and creation of
internal tensions
<P>

The Directors of the NRMA and NRMA Insurance believe that the proposal which
Members are being asked to vote on, is the best alternative.
They considered
that it would not be helpful to put forward inferior proposals. The possibility
of confusion would be greatly increased
if members had to absorb even more
information than is presently before them. The quantity of material needed to
cover just this
one proposal is already very large.
<P>

<b>4.	Are all the Directors in favour of the proposal?</b>
<P>

There are 16 directors of the Association. [<u>Additional comments if
required</u>]
<P>

There are 11 directors of NRMA Insurance, 8 of whom are common to the board of
the Association. [<u>Additional comments if required</u>]
<P>

<b>5.	What happens if Members reject the Proposal?</b>
<P>

If either the members of the Association or NRMA Insurance do not pass the
special resolution to approve the proposed restructuring,
the NRMA structure
will remain the same as it is today. Shares will not be issued and the NRMA
will not list on the Stock Exchange.
<P>

It is a matter for the members as to whether the structure proposed by your
directors should be implemented. The decision of the
members is final.
<P>

<b>6.	Can't the NRMA be taken over if it issues shares? Will there be any
protection from this?</b>
<P>

The Articles of NRMA Holdings have a built-in protection against takeover. This
is a limit of 5% on the number of Shares which any
person or company may own.
This limit will also apply to groups of people or companies (known as
associates) acting together to control
a block of shares which together is more
than 5%. If someone does acquire more than 5% of the Shares then Directors of
NRMA Holdings
can take away the voting and dividend rights which those Shares
have. The Directors can also force the owner of the Shares to reduce
the number
of Shares which he or she owns so that he or she is then within the 5%
limit.
<P>

The Articles which give this protection can only be changed if the shareholders
agree to the change by a special resolution. A special
resolution requires 75%
of those voting to be in favour.
<P>

As well as the protection given by the Articles, the Directors expect that the
Shares of NRMA Holdings will be held by many present
NRMA Members. So a
takeover could only occur if the people who are not Members decided to sell
their Shares after they became shareholders.
<P>

On the other hand the NRMA's present structure gives no protection against
takeover.
<P>

<b>7.	With shareholders, NRMA will become profit hungry. Services will go down
and prices will go up.</b>
<P>

NRMA under its present structure already makes profits. It's [sic] aim has
been, and will continue to be, to provide Road Service,
Insurance and other
products and services at the lowest possible cost consistent with sound
financial management.
<P>

In other words even while selling its insurance and Road Service at very
competitive prices the NRMA has been making profits.
<P>

It is this prudent management of NRMA over the years that has helped make the
organisation so strong and enables it to provide excellent
value for money
services and products for Members.
<P>

So, changing the NRMA's structure does not create any greater pressure to make
profits.
<P>

The Board and management of the NRMA recognise that the success of the NRMA is
built on the trust and loyalty of Members and other
customers. This exists
because we provide an efficient Road Service and other services at a reasonable
price. That positive image
which the NRMA has is a commercial advantage of
enormous value. Whatever the structure of the NRMA, this is something which any
financially
responsible organisation would conserve.
<P>

<b>8.	This proposal is too complicated - why not just reduce Insurance premiums
and/or Road Service fees?</b>
<P>

If we simply reduced prices for our services and products below their true
cost, there would be serious long term consequences for
the NRMA and ultimately
Members.
<P>

Price cuts would encourage other persons to join NRMA simply to get the lower
prices. This means that present Members are giving
away the NRMA's wealth to
these new customers for no benefit. This is very unfair to existing Members.
<P>

Charging less than the real cost of insurance or Road Service ultimately
damages the NRMA because it weakens its reserves. NRMA's
assets would have to
be sold to subsidise the artificially low prices and this would mean that there
would be more pressure to increase
prices in future years.
<P>

Carried to the extreme, a program of reduced charges and premiums would lead to
very low charges for a couple of years followed
by dramatic price increases
when the reserves (used to subsidise the artificial price) had run out.
<P>

By giving Shares to Members there is no need to take money out of the NRMA and
give it to Members. This preserves the strength of
the NRMA, while also giving
all Members (not just policyholders) a substantial stake in NRMA and the chance
to directly benefit from
any future success.
<P>

Finally an average Member with $1200 worth of free shares is forecast to get
yearly dividends of $60 (see Directors forecast on
page xx). This is enough to
cover the cost of Service Membership and leave some over for other purposes.
<P>

<b>9.	Will the NRMA change if it becomes a shareholder company?</b>
<P>

Some members are worried that this proposal will mean that the NRMA will no
longer look after the interests of its Members and of
motorists.
<P>

The NRMA is committed to promoting the interests of its members and of
motorists and this commitment will be maintained under the
proposed structure.
Only the legal framework of the NRMA is changing, not its culture. The NRMA
will have the same management, the
same people and the same goals as it has
always had.
<P>

There is also a legal commitment as well as an emotional commitment to these
goals, as the constitution of NRMA Holdings ensures
that the Association's
constitution must include the following objectives:
<P>

(a)	`To promote the interest of motorists and other road users, throughout
Australia, in good roads, safety and consumer protection.
<P>

(b)	To provide motorists and others with a range of services including
provision of emergency or breakdown road service and other
services to
vehicles.'
<P>

<b>10.	Is the NRMA's Expansion into Victoria the reason behind the
Proposal?</b>
<P>

No, although the new structure would make it much easier for the profits from
expansion to go directly to Members. The NRMA's expansion
was motivated by:
<P>

*	the need to gain access to new markets for the NRMA's major insurance
products
<P>

*	the need to maintain its leading position as one of Australia's largest
general insurers
<P>

*	the need to spread the NRMA Insurance's risk over a greater geographic area.
It is more difficult and more expensive for the NRMA
to protect itself against
a narrow geographic spread of risk."
<P>

718	At the communications meeting on 17 June 1994 Ms Godwin said that
Mr Barrett would "look at <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 1</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">4</a>" of the prospectus, with the
comment that the prospectus was "now time critical".  The then draft of the
prospectus was discussed
at the meeting of the due diligence committee on
20 June 1994, but the evidence did not reveal any detail of the
discussion.
<P>

719	The next draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus was different again.  This
must have particularly reflected Mr Barrett's input, although not without
reference
to Mr Bateman, as appears from what has already been said and from a
memorandum from Mr Barrett to Ms Godwin dated 24 June 1994 which
included -
<P>

"The thinking behind the changes in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> were:
<P>

NRMA members and policyholders will have already received answers to some of
the questions the share issue raises in the marketing
communications. I
therefore think the beginning of the section should remain as Prue had it.
Potential shareholders will want to
know, first off, what the change means and
how the share offer will work.
<P>

For those doubters who still need to be persuaded after reading this, we then
explain why the change is being proposed, why it's
the best alternative and
what other alternatives were considered. Considering alternatives rather than
attempting to answer pros
and cons communicates the message more positively and
avoids the problem of inadequate responses.
<P>

I have included all the points Greg felt needed to be inserted from his
paper."
<P>

720	The version of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 1</a> of the prospectus dated 24 June 1994 was
broadly the same as the draft of 16 June 1994 in its early parts (although for
some reason
the capitalised phrase Free Shares was less used), but now had  as
the part most directly dealing with advantages and disadvantages
-
<P>

"<b>WHY IS THE NRMA PROPOSING THIS CHANGE?</b>
<P>

The days when NRMA was regarded as a `club' or `non-profit organisation' are
long gone.
<P>

This is evident from:
<P>

*	its sheer size, whether judged by assets or membership numbers;
<P>

*	the continued growth in net assets;
<P>

*	the substantial profits earned; and
<P>

*	the inability to effectively distribute the profit
<P>

The Association, which provides members with road service, only ever makes a
relatively small profit. Even though the Association
appoints the board of NRMA
insurance, it doesn't have any access to the substantial profits made by the
insurance company. Because
of the NRMA's structure, the small profits made by
the Association cannot be `pooled' with the larger profits of NRMA Insurance,
so the financial success cannot be shared adequately with the members, who own
the NRMA.
<P>

<b>WHY IS THE PROPOSAL THE BEST ALTERNATIVE?</b>
<P>

Under the new structure the `profit pools' of the Association and NRMA
Insurance will be brought together and be fully available
to NRMA Holdings.
<P>

Members will have a direct ownership stake in the NRMA and the opportunity to
share directly in what directors believe will be the
future success of the
NRMA.
<P>

`Direct ownership' means that:
<P>

*	it is the member (who is now the shareholder) who will receive dividends
which the company pays. Dividends come from profits and
under the present
structure it is extremely difficult to distribute profits directly to
members.
<P>

*	as the value of the NRMA increases so does the value of the member's shares.
In other words the member's asset increases in value.
<P>

*	the member can increase his or her level of ownership in the NRMA, something
which is not possible under the current structure.
<P>

*	if the member/shareholder chooses, he or she can convert their ownership of
the NRMA into cash. Again this is not possible under
the current structure.
<P>

*	the tax paid by the NRMA on its profits can be used to make any dividends tax
effective, through the `franking' of the dividends.
<P>

*	members will have a greater interest in voting on matters put to shareholders
(including the annual election of directors of NRMA
Holdings) as they will have
a direct financial interest in the NRMA.
<P>

<b>WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED?</b>
<P>

The Directors considered a number of alternatives. These included:
<P>

1.	doing nothing;
<P>

2.	reducing premiums and membership fees;
<P>

3.	one-off or continuous payment of rebates;
<P>

4.	only converting part of the NRMA to a company limited by shares and listing
that part on the Stock Exchange.
<P>

<b>1.	Doing nothing</b>
<P>

It is not essential that the proposal before members be implemented. Life could
go on under the present structure without much difficulty.
Why do it then? The
first answer is that things could be so much better for members if they became
shareholders in the NRMA listed
on the Stock Exchange. If there is a better way
of doing things for members it should be investigated and, if appropriate,
implemented.
This is the fundamental viewpoint that drives the proposal.
<P>

Secondly, there are a number of problems which the NRMA faces because of its
present structure. These are:
<P>

*	Members do not have direct access to the financial success of the NRMA.
<P>

*	Members have little incentive to participate in the governance of the NRMA.
This is shown by the very low number of members who
vote in NRMA elections. In
1993 only ___ of 1.8 million members voted.
<P>

*	There is no protection against a takeover. A takeover under the present
structure may take slightly longer but the person wishing
to takeover the NRMA
would not even have to pay members for it.
<P>

<b>2.	Reducing premiums and membership fees</b>
<P>

*	If we simply reduced prices for our services and products below their true
cost, there would be serious long term consequences
for the NRMA and its
members.
<P>

*	Price cuts would encourage people to join the NRMA simply to get lower
prices. This would result in present members giving away
the NRMA's wealth to
these new customers for no benefit. This would be very unfair to existing
members.
<P>

*	Charging less than the real cost of insurance or road service would
ultimately damage the NRMA because it would weaken its reserves.
NRMA's assets
would have to be sold to subsidise the artificially low prices and this would
mean that there would be more pressure
to increase prices in future years.
<P>

*	Carried to the extreme, a program of reduced charges and premiums would lead
to very low charges for a couple of years followed
by dramatic price increases
when the reserves (used to subsidise the artificial price) had run out.
<P>

*	Significant reduction in premiums would also destabilise the insurance market
as some of our less financially strong competitors
tried to keep up by price
cutting. This would create risk for the community at large.
<P>

*	Finally an average member with $1200 worth of free shares is forecast to get
yearly dividends of $60 (see Directors forecast on
page xx). This is enough to
cover the cost of service membership and leave some over for other purposes.
<P>

<b>3.	One-off or continuous payment of rebates</b>
<P>

Over the past two years NRMA Insurance has given back $197 million in the form
of insurance rebates.
<P>

However, this provides only a short term solution and only benefits
policyholders, not the 30% or so of members who are not policyholders.
Continued rebates are destabilising. Initially they encourage rapid growth in
market share as people seek to benefit from the reductions
but if these
reductions could no longer be maintained and prices rose, the NRMA would be
vulnerable to consumer reaction (criticism
and loss of business) and possibly
government intervention.
<P>

By giving shares to members there is no need to take money out of the NRMA and
give it to members. This preserves the strength of
the NRMA, while also giving
all members (not just policyholders) a substantial stake in NRMA and the chance
to directly benefit from
any future success.
<P>

<b>4.	Converting part of the NRMA to a company limited by shares and </b>
<P>

<b>	listing that part on the Stock Exchange</b>
<P>

This alternative has the following disadvantages:
<P>

*	control of the NRMA name becomes more difficult;
<P>

*	fragmentation of the NRMA into parts could destroy the value of the NRMA over
time; and
<P>

*	the possibility of disunity of the NRMA's public face and creation of
internal tensions
<P>

The Directors of the NRMA and NRMA Insurance believe that the proposal which
members are being asked to vote on, is the best alternative.
They considered
that it would not be helpful to put forward inferior proposals. The possibility
of confusion would be greatly increased
if members had to absorb even more
information that is presently before them. The quantity of material needed to
cover just this
one proposal is already very large."
<P>

721	There was then revived at board level what Mr Talbot had earlier raised
concerning a `no' case.  
<P>

722	There was to be a meeting of the board of Association on 30 June 1994.
On 29 June 1994 Ms Singleton wrote to Mr Mackay saying
that she
could not be at the meeting and seeking leave of absence.  Her letter
continued -
<P>

"Also I wish to commend the following motion to the meeting.  Geoff Lawson is
the mover and Dawn Fraser the seconder.  
<P>

Both you and Ray know of my firm belief that it is our duty as directors to
ensure all sides of the debate are put to members and
policy holders.
<P>

Members have a right to exercise their vote in the fullest possible knowledge
of what the changes may mean for them, for the future
of the organisation and
the insurance industry ... to say nothing of the long term future of their road
service organisation.
<P>

I ask that you to table this letter in support of the motion and supply copies
to all directors before the motion is put.
<P>

`<i>To enable members to be clearly informed about the issues to be put before
them re the "share the future project" that an amount equal
to that spent on
publicity, advertising and promotion for the share the future project be
expended on explaining the no case to the
members in direct mail, free-media,
promotion and advertising.</i>' "
<P>

723	Someone added "Jane's letter" to the agenda for the board steering
committee meeting of 29 June 1994.  The minutes of the meeting
of the
board steering committee said nothing on that subject.  However, on 29 June
1994 Ms Conway had sent a copy of Miss Singleton's
letter to
Mr Bateman with a note, "I would like to discuss with you as soon as
possible an amendment to the proposed motion to which
she refers", and a file
note of Mr Bateman dated that day and recording communication with
Ms Conway included "resl to be left on
the table until 28/7/94".
According to Mr Bateman, Ms Conway told him that "Don's told me that Jane
Singleton's resolution is to
be left on the table until the next meeting on 28
July 1994".  It is plain enough that there was advance discussion between Mr
Mackay
and Ms Conway, and possibly between Mr Mackay and other board members,
of what in fact happened, a resolution of the board of Association
whereby the
motion would lie on the table.
<P>

724	Also on 29 June 1994, Mr Barrett faxed to Ms Conway a
document reading -
<P>

<center>"<b>CONSIDERATIONS ON PRESENTING A</b>
<P>

<b>BALANCED CASE TO MEMBERS</b></center>
<P>

<b>1.	Antagonistic campaigns</b>
<P>

Consideration has been given as to how best to present a balanced case to
Members.
<P>

Funding a `Yes' and "No' case was considered but rejected as being potentially
too damaging to the organisation.
<P>

Funding two rival groups would result in a bitter war of words by two marketing
teams trying to best each other rather than present
information for
consideration in a stable atmosphere.
<P>

The consequences would be:
<P>

*	Damage to staff morale;
<P>

*	Damage to the public standing of the organisation and undermining of its
advocacy role; and
<P>

*	Commercial damage as product marketing was drowned out by the media clutter
and acrimony of a divisive campaign.
<P>

<b>2.	The Alternative</b>
<P>

The alternative is a reasonable process of education based on Corporations Law
and supervised by the ASC, the objective of which
is to present all information
reasonably necessary for a member to determine how to vote.
<P>

The Corporations Law and ASC have been and are sensitive to the needs of the
public for fair and accurate information.
<P>

<b>3.	Experience so far</b>
<P>

The experience so far indicates that information provided to Members has been
balanced in content and restrained in its magnitude.
<P>

There have been three editions of Open Road, including the one currently in
production, since March 16. They have carried reference
to Members' concerns.
Indeed the current edition's reference to the proposal is entirely based on
letters from Members expressing
concerns and brief responses to those
concerns.
<P>

Direct mail to Members has been:
<P>

*	A brochure to Gold Card Members which emphasised that there was a special
hotline for them to raise their concerns;
<P>

*	A personalised letter on entitlement along with a brochure which included the
concerns of Members.
<P>

Advertising done so far has been:
<P>

*	In March to alert Members to the existence of a telephone information service
to record their concerns and get more information;
<P>

*	In June to inform Members that an important letter was being sent and
detailing the deadline for a response where necessary.
<P>

In both cases the amount of advertising used was sufficient only to ensure the
majority of Members received what was important information.
<P>

Since March, the organisation has conducted only one media conference on this
subject.
<P>

<b>4.	The Future</b>
<P>

Details of the education campaign necessary should the Board decide to pursue
the proposal and put it to a vote of Members have
not been finalised. However,
the same considerations exercised so far in terms of balanced content and
magnitude would be used.
<P>

<b>5.	Presumption of imbalance</b>
<P>

The motion presumes that communication on this subject is intended to put a pro
case and this is not so. The intention of the organisation,
and requirement of
the Corporations Law, is for balance."
<P>

From the last paragraph, the document must have been a response to the proposed
motion of which Ms Singleton had given notice. 
It is not clear whether Ms
Conway put the document before the board or conveyed its content to the
board.
<P>

725	At the board meeting on 30 June 1994 the letter from Ms Singleton
to Mr Mackay was tabled, and Mr Lawson moved and Miss Fraser
seconded the motion to which it referred.  Mr Mackay urged by Mr Lawson to
wait until he saw the final version of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus, saying that
he thought it would contain sufficient information to meet his concerns.  There
was discussion.  Mr
Mackay moved and Mr Kirby seconded that the motion lie
on the table, and Mr Mackay's motion was carried with the dissent of
Mr Talbot,
Miss Fraser and Mr Lawson noted.
<P>

726	Mr Barrett told the communications meeting on 1 July 1994 that
the draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus and the onsert would be available the
following week.  The prospectus working group had a number of intensive
sessions
going through drafts, there being of course other Sections the
drafting of which these reasons do not consider.  A new draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a>, it
seems produced by Mr Barrett, was considered and amended.  
<P>

727	The resulting draft dated 2 July 1994 referred frequently to free shares
and Free Shares, and can readily enough be recognised
as a lineal ancestor in
layout, language, and content to the Section in the prospectus in its final
form.  It included -
<P>

"<b>ALTERNATIVE SCHEMES</b>
<P>

The NRMA has considered carefully the advantages and disadvantages of a range
of options and concluded that the share issue and
listing is in the best
interest of the organisation and its members.
<P>

Alternative options which the Boards have examined include:
<P>

1.	<u>Doing nothing</u>: While the NRMA could continue to operate under its
present structure, the Boards decided that the NRMA would function more
effectively
and its members would be better off if the publicly listed company
proposal were adopted. To do nothing means the wealth of the organisation
remains locked up and inaccessible to members. The successful momentum built up
over the years would not be channelled as productively
as might be.
<P>

2.	<u>Reducing premiums and membership fees</u>: Reducing charges for NRMA
services and products below their true cost would weaken the financial strength
of the NRMA and increase
the pressure for higher prices in the future.
Unrealistic pricing would disadvantage current members since the accumulated
wealth
they helped build would in effect be subsidising the new customers who
would undoubtedly rush to take advantage of cheaper premiums.
<P>

3.	<u>Continuing payment of insurance rebates</u>: Over the past three years
NRMA Insurance has given back $291 million to policy-holders in the form of
rebates. Rebates in their
present form are only a short-term solution and only
benefit policyholders - and not the 30 percent of members who do not hold
insurance
policies. By giving members free shares they can benefit directly
from the future success of the NRMA by way of dividends.
<P>

4.	<u>Making a one-off major payment to members</u>: Such a major payment would
denude the organisation of its capital, restrict its ability to fund
opportunities and be liable to heavy
taxation.
<P>

5.	<u>Sell off NRMA Insurance</u>: Such an approach suffers from a number of
problems. Firstly, the strength of the NRMA has been the existence of road
service and
insurance working in tandem, each benefiting from the other. If
they were to separate each would be weakened. The value of the combination
is
greater than its parts. Second, each uses assets owned by the other and there
would be significant financial consequences for
each company. Third, a
separation of the two would mean splitting the management and staff of NRMA
with a likely fracturing of that
culture which has made the NRMA a success.
<P>

<b>THE NEXT STEPS</b>
<P>

On [date] there will be two general meetings at [venue].  Details of the
meeting times and the resolution to be considered are on
pages &gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; of this prospectus.  One meeting will be for NRMA Ltd (the
Association) and the other for NRMA
Insurance Ltd.  These meetings will decide
the future structure of the NRMA and members can participate either by
attending the meetings
in person or by filling in the proxy voting form on the
front of this prospectus.
<P>

Having carefully considered the implications, the boards believe that
conversion and flotation on the Australian Stock Exchange
are in the best
interests of the NRMA and its members.
<P>

The Boards urge members to vote in favour of the resolutions.  If voting by
post members should return the form on the front of
this document by [date].
Members who are voting against the resolution should also fill out the
Acceptance of Free Shares section
of the accompanying form.
<P>

Members approval will mean a change from being members of the Association and
members of NRMA Insurance to shareholders in NRMA
Holdings, the company which
will be listed on the Stock Exchange.
<P>

The legal steps involved are:
<P>

*	Changing the legal status of the Association and NRMA Insurance from
companies limited by guarantee to companies limited by shares
and guarantee;
<P>

*	adopting new articles for each company, the central element of which means
that members (other than NRMA Holdings) agree to swap
membership of the
Association and NRMA Insurance for an offer of free shares in NRMA Holdings.
This agreement binds all members even
if they voted against the proposal or did
not vote at all;
<P>

*	approving how the free shares in NRMA Holdings will be allocated;
<P>

*	in the case of the Association, approving changes to the Memorandum and
Articles of NRMA Insurance so that NRMA Holdings controls
NRMA Insurance;
and
<P>

*	approving the overall changes in the structure of the NRMA so that each of
the Association and NRMA Insurance is owned and controlled
by NRMA Holdings
which will be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
<P>

You will find the Notices of Meeting for the Association and NRMA Insurance on
pages [?] at the end of this Section.
<P>

<b>SOME OF MEMBERS' OTHER QUESTIONS</b>
<P>

*	WHAT HAPPENS IF MEMBERS REJECT THE PROPOSAL?
<P>

If either the members of the Association or NRMA Insurance do not pass the
special resolution to approve the proposed restructuring,
the NRMA structure
will remain the same as it is today. Free shares will not be issued and the
NRMA will not list on the Stock Exchange.
<P>

*	WILL THE NRMA CHANGE ITS CULTURE?
<P>

No. The commitment to road service and competitive insurance will remain. What
changes is the structure of the organisation so that
members get free shares.
The culture and philosophy that have made the NRMA so successful will not
change.
<P>

*	CAN THE NRMA BE TAKEN OVER IF IT ISSUES SHARES?
<P>

Special protection against takeover has been given to the NRMA.
<P>

Because of the unusual nature of the NRMA and the size of its membership, the
Stock Exchange has agreed to prohibit any person (of
company) from owning more
that [sic] 5% of the shares. This limit will also apply to groups of people or
companies (known as associates)
acting together to control a block of shares
which together is more than 5%.
<P>

This protection can only be changed if the shareholders agree to the change by
a special resolution.
<P>

The Board's recommendation that members accept shares will limit the number of
shares available to `outsiders'.
<P>

*	WITH SHAREHOLDERS, WILL THE NRMA PURSUE PROFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF SERVICE?
<P>

Just the opposite. The NRMA, like any other business, must deliver good
products at reasonable cost if it is to be successful. The
NRMA has been able
to do this to members' and policyholders' satisfaction that is why it has be
[sic] successful. It would be silly
to change such a winning formula.
<P>

*	WILL THE COST OF MY SERVICE MEMBERSHIP GO UP?
<P>

No increase is planned, or necessary, at this stage. In addition, an average
shareholder with a $1,200 parcel of shares is forecast
to receive $60 a year in
dividends (see Directors' forecast on page    ). This is enough to cover the
cost of service membership
and leave some over for other purposes.
<P>

*	WHAT HAPPENS TO MEMBERSHIP CARDS?
<P>

You will be issued with a service membership card which will be similar to your
current card. The card will show the number of years
you have been a member,
and will be sent out when it is time to pay your annual subscription.
<P>

All the special benefits offered to Gold Card members (those with 25 years' or
more continuous membership) will continue.
<P>

*	HOW WILL THE FREE SHARES AFFECT MY TAX POSITION?
<P>

*	HOW WILL THE FREE SHARES AFFECT MY PENSION?
<P>

*	WHEN WILL MEMBERS RECEIVE THEIR FREE SHARES?
<P>

It [sic] the proposal is approved by members, share certificates will be sent
to members who have chosen to accept the offer of
free shares starting on <u>
  </u>.
<P>

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
<P>

The NRMA Boards have carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of
the proposed share offer and concluded that the proposal
is in the best
interests of the Association and its members. The Boards therefore recommend
that:
<P>

*	members of the NRMA Limited (`The Association') and NRMA Insurance Limited
(`NRMA Insurance') vote in favour of the proposal;
and
<P>

*	elect to take free shares.
<P>

Your vote is important.
<P>

75% of members of each company who vote (either in person or by proxy) must
vote `yes' for the change to go ahead.
<P>

TO CAST YOUR VOTE, EITHER COMPLETE THE FORM AT THE FRONT OF THIS PROSPECTUS, OR
ATTEND THE MEETING IN PERSON, DETAILS OF THE MEETINGS
ARE SET OUT ON PAGE
[?]"
<P>

728	This version of the prospectus was considered at length by the prospectus
working group on 2 July 1994.  The participants included
Mr Willing,
Ms Godwin, Mr Barry, Mr Barrett, Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman.
Many amendments were made, mainly in matters of detail rather
than the scope of
the Section.  
<P>

729	On 4 July 1994 Mr Bateman spent some time going through the
changes with Ms Godwin.  As on other such occasions, some of his
suggestions were taken up, others were not, and changes other than those
discussed with him were made.  
<P>

730	The then draft of the prospectus came before the due diligence committee
late on 4 July 1994, and was discussed.  Again the
minutes of the meeting
do not recall any detail.  It may have been at this meeting, or if not it was
at a similar meeting at about
this time, that there was an exchange between Mr
Mackay and Mr Morgan concerning the use of the expression `free shares'.  I
have
earlier referred to this in connection with Mr Rees' evidence of
discussion of free shares at a planning meeting shortly before 17
March
1994.
<P>

731	According to Mr Mackay, when he opened the meeting he said words to the
effect, "It is important that the prospectus be kept
as simple as possible.
One reservation that I have relates to the use of the word `free'.  It may not
be correct to use the term
`free' as members are in effect giving up their
rights as members in return for the shares."  Mr Morgan said, "We have already
considered
that.  You need have no fears in that regard.  The term `free' means
that the shares are being issued without payment and in the
circumstances it is
quite appropriate."  
<P>

732	Mr Morgan's recollection was rather different.  According to Mr Morgan, the
exchange was not in the open meeting, but before
or after the meeting and
between Mr Mackay and him alone.  Mr Mackay asked, "Are you happy with the use
of the expression `free shares'
in the prospectus?"  Mr Morgan replied, "I
believe that it is proper to use the term in the sense that we are not asking
people to
pay any money for the shares and so I think we are able to use that
term in the prospectus to describe the shares.  The structure
of the proposal
is that the members will give up their membership and that will allow Holdings
to pay up the shares and issue them
to members without any payment by them.
The members will be compensated for the loss of road service and other
membership services
by a contract.  In the sense that the members are not
required to pay anything for the shares which are issued to them, I believe
that it is correct to say that the shares are `free'.  It seems to me that is a
proper use of the term so long as members are made
aware of the fact that they
are giving up their membership and receiving shares or cash in place of
membership."  
<P>

733	The essence of the exchange is much the same on both accounts, and the
precise terms and whether it was part of the conduct
of the business of the
meeting may not matter.  Mr Bateman denied that an exchange of this nature
occurred in his presence, and as
has been seen there were other occasions to
which such an exchange concerning free shares might be relevant.  I should
therefore
attempt to go further.
<P>

734	If the exchange occurred in the manner described by Mr Mackay, rather than
in the manner described by Mr Morgan, one would expect
recollection of it by
persons such as Mr Kirby, Dr Werner, Mr Willing, Mr Rees, Ms Godwin, and Mr
Gonzales, all of whom were at the
due diligence committee meeting of 4 July
1994 and gave evidence.  
<P>

735	Mr Kirby gave no evidence on the matter.  Dr Werner recalled Mr Mackay
saying, probably prior to the meeting's formal deliberations,
words to the
effect, "Is everyone satisfied about the use of the expression `free shares' in
the prospectus", and that there was
some discussion as part of which Mr Morgan
said something indicating that he thought the expression was appropriate and
lawful and
could be used in the prospectus.  When there was put to him the
account given by Mr Morgan, he agreed that Mr Morgan did speak at
length and
could well have said  what Mr Morgan had recounted.  Indeed, Dr Werner's
recollection was rather against Mr Mackay having
said that it may not be
correct to use the term "free" as members were in effect giving up their rights
as members in return for
the shares, because Dr Werner thought he would have
recalled that matter;  according to Dr Werner, Mr Mackay simply asked whether
everyone was happy with the use of the word.  
<P>

736	Ms Godwin had no recollection of such an exchange, but her recollection
beyond her notes was generally not good.  At one point
Mr Gonzalez gave
evidence that he recalled at a meeting of the due diligence committee in 1994
Mr Mackay, or possibly Mr Willing,
saying words to the effect "Is everybody
satisfied that it is appropriate to use the word `free' in the prospectus?",
and that Mr
Morgan replied to the effect, "I am satisfied that the use of that
word is appropriate and it is not an issue";  this was during
the formal
proceedings of the meeting.  Mr Gonzalez could not say that this was at the
meeting of 4 July 1994, and it may have been
at some other meeting.  In other
evidence Mr Gonzales gave his recollection as simply that when asked about the
prospectus and the
word "free", Mr Morgan answered that there was no problem
with using that word;  that, he said, was his best recollection, and when
Mr
Morgan's account of the exchange was put to him he said he did not remember the
words but it was "the inference of the whole -
the whole process" and, rather
strangely, that he could not remember whether it was consistent with his
recollection of the exchange.
 
<P>

737	There can be taken into account also the evidence of Mr Rees of the
planning meeting earlier described, and of two other occasions
on which he
recalled discussion of free shares.  The first was a luncheon in 1994, and the
second was a meeting of the due diligence
committee which he could not place in
time.  
<P>

738	The luncheon was shortly after Mr Mackay returned from overseas, as an
occasion for Mr Mackay to find out about the progress
of the proposal, and must
have been very close to the meeting of 4 July 1994 - it is possible that
imperfect recollections are of
the same occasion, some treating it as a
meeting, some as an event prior to a meeting, and Mr Rees as an informal
meeting.  According
to Mr Rees, Mr Mackay asked about the word "free" being
used in the then current draft of the prospectus, and Mr Morgan said, "Provided
the expression `Free Shares' is defined properly in the prospectus and we make
it clear that the members are giving up their legal
rights, it is appropriate
to use the expression.  The due diligence committee has already seen drafts
with this terminology and will
have the opportunity later to fully consider the
issue and satisfy itself that it is a proper term to use in the prospectus".

<P>

739	 As to the other occasion, Mr Rees recalled someone raising at the due
diligence committee meeting whether "it was okay from
a legal point of view to
use the word `free'", and he said that both Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman replied
that it was.  The recollection
was that Mr Morgan said, "In my opinion,
provided we define the expression `Free Shares' and make it clear in the
prospectus that
the members are required to give up their membership to obtain
the shares then it is okay legally to use the expression".  Mr Bateman
said
words to the effect, "The meaning of the word `free' in the prospectus is that
the members will not being paying any cash out
of their own pockets to acquire
the shares and therefore it is okay to use the word `free' to describe the
shares provided the prospectus
makes it clear that the members will be giving
up certain rights".  
<P>

740	There were many differences in recollection, but on balance I think that
there was an exchange at a meeting early in July 1994
in which Mr Mackay
questioned whether the language of free shares could be used, and Mr Morgan
said it could, the others at the meeting
hearing what was said even though it
may not have been part of the formal business of the meeting.  I think,
however, that Mr Morgan
explained that the language of free shares could be
used provided members were made aware of the fact that they were giving up
membership
and receiving shares or cash instead.  That is consistent with Mr
Morgan's state of mind and with some other occasions on which the
matter came
up.  Further, it is probable that Mr Bateman was present on the occasion of
which Mr Mackay gave evidence, and I accept
that on one or more of the
occasions on which the matter came up he took a similar position to that of Mr
Morgan, either tacitly,
by express agreement, or by his own explanation as
recalled by Mr Rees.  I do not think any more detailed finding can reliably be
made.
<P>

741	Another version of the prospectus, a draft of 5 July 1994, was produced.
On 6 July 1994 Mr Morgan wrote to Ms Godwin suggesting
expansion of the
description of the legal steps involved to refer to members giving up their
membership on condition that Free Shares
were offered by Holdings, leaving
Holdings as the only member of Association and Insurance.  This expansion,
further expanded again,
was in the prospectus in its final form.  That Mr
Morgan suggested it at this time lends some support to what I have said about
the
meeting early in July 1994 - if Mr Mackay questioned the language of free
shares on 4 July 1994, Mr Morgan may well have been moved
to ensure that the
prospectus contained the explanation he then gave.
<P>

742	The intensive consideration by the prospectus working group continued, with
more changes.  The then version of the prospectus
came before due diligence
committee on 11 July 1994, and was discussed:  again the minutes do not
include any detail.  A copy of
the prospectus in its then form was tabled and
noted at a joint meeting of the boards of Association and Insurance on
14 July 1994,
and members of the boards were asked to provide their
comments by 18 July 1994.  By this time there was some urgency.
Ms Godwin told
Mr Bateman on 14 July 1994 that corrections for
all Sections of the prospectus were needed on 15 July 1994 in order to
meet printing
deadlines.  
<P>

743	The prospectus working group went through the prospectus on 15 July
1994, and the due diligence committee went through it on
18 July 1994.
The printing deadlines seem to have been overcome.  Although the minutes of the
due diligence committee meeting did
not (as usual) contain any detail, they
recorded that it was resolved that a further draft of the prospectus would be
distributed
to members of the committee by 21 July 1994 for discussion at
the meeting on 25 July 1994.  
<P>

744	The current versions of the prospectus and the onsert were before the board
steering committee on 21 July 1994, and it was said
that approval should
be sought from the relevant boards on 28 July 1994.  At the joint board
meeting of Association and Insurance
later on 21 July 1994 the draft
prospectus and the onsert were tabled and noted, and members of the boards were
asked to provide
their comments in relation to the prospectus by Monday,
25 July 1994.  (This was the occasion for Ms Singleton's query, already
mentioned
and shortly to be dealt with in more detail.)  
<P>

745	Comments and changes were still being made, including comments on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a>
by Mr Morgan, Mr Bateman and members of the boards, and the next version of the
prospectus was discussed at the meeting of the due
diligence committee on
25 July 1994.  It was noted that a further draft would be available on
1 August 1994, and that 8 August 1994
was the deadline for amendments
to the document.  So finality in the prospectus was coming closer, and earlier
concentration of work
at the level of the prospectus working group had moved to
consideration and comments by the due diligence committee and the boards.
 
<P>

746	The question of a "no" case then re-emerged.  
<P>

747	At a meeting on 26 July 1994 attended by Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Ms Ralph
by telephone, Mr Burrows, Mr Willing, Mr Corrigan, Mr
Rees, Ms Conway, Ms
Godwin, Mr Barrett, Mr Morgan, Mr Bateman, and perhaps others, there was
reference to the prospectus reflected
in Mr Bateman's note of the
"no" case as one of a number of issues that would emerge.  He made a further
note "NO case so far as
is known is canvassed in Prospectus + other NRMA
publications"
<P>

748	The question of a "no" case was also highlighted by a letter to Mr Mackay
dated 26 July 1994 from the Labour Council of New
South Wales, reading -
<P>

"The Labour Council of NSW recently considered the NRMA Boards' current
proposal to alter the ownership structure of the NRMA. 
The Labour Council is
concerned that prior to any election to determine this matter, a proper flow of
information is provided to
NRMA members detailing both the advantages and
disadvantages of any new ownership structure.  It is Labour Council's
understanding
that currently the NRMA Board is only proposing to highlight the
case for changing the current structure.  It has been brought to
our attention
that a number of NRMA's directors are not supportive of the proposed changes;
clearly if there is not unanimity at
director level about the merits of change,
it is even more incumbent on the Board to ensure all the arguments are put in
an even
handed manner.  Labour Council, I stress, has not at this stage, taken
a view for or against the proposed changes, our concerns relate
to the fairness
of the process being proposed.
<P>

Accordingly, I would appreciate your response to this matter outlining how the
NRMA Board proposes to ensure that both sides of
this important issue are
conveyed to the membership."
<P>

749	The question was brought up at board level, at a joint meeting of the
boards of Association and Insurance on 28 July 1994. 
Present as the
Association board were Mr Kirby, Ms Ralph, Ms Booth, Mr Burrows, Mrs Callaghan,
Mr Douglass, Mr Farr-Jones, Miss Fraser,
Dame Leonie Kramer, Mr Lawson, Ms
Singleton, Mr Talbot, Dr Vanderfield, and Dr Werner.  Present as the Insurance
board were Mr Kirby,
Mr Burrows, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Corrigan, Mr Douglass, Mr
Easson, Mr Farr-Jones, Ms Singleton, and Mr Willing.  Those in attendance
included Mr Rees and Ms Conway, but not Mr Morgan or Mr Bateman.  
<P>

750	At least according to the minutes, the draft prospectus was not before the
boards or considered.  But Ms Singleton proposed
a motion, which was
seconded by Miss Fraser, in the terms of the motion which had been moved
by Mr Lawson on 30 June 1994 and was
then lying on the table.  The
minutes of Association recorded, after  the terms of the motion -
<P>

"During discussion, when asked what the `no' case was,
Ms F J Singleton said she had no `no' case to outline.
<P>

The Chairman ruled that the motion was out of order, as the Board had
previously resolved it was to lie on the table and the intent
was that it be
dealt with when a final decision is to be made by the Board in relation to
putting the proposal to list the NRMA Group
on the Australian Stock Exchange to
the members.
<P>

Ms F J Singleton then moved a motion dissenting from the Chairman's ruling that
her original motion lay on the table. This motion
was seconded by Miss D
Fraser.
<P>

The motion was lost.
<P>

Miss D Fraser, Ms F J Singleton, Mr R Talbot and Mr G Lawson voted for the
motion."
<P>

751	By 28 July 1994 the prospectus had reached printer's proof stage.
Comments were still being received, including from Mr Morgan
and
Mr Bateman.  The topic of disadvantages in relation to the proposal can
have been no less in the minds of all concerned than
previously.  The Open Road
for August/September contained a number of letters to the editor in which
correspondents expressed concerns,
followed by the editor's comments generally
directed to allaying the concerns.  The concerns found in the letters selected
were that
the NRMA would be open for takeover;  that mutuality would be
affected and there would be a conflict between the interests of shareholders
and NRMA users;  that entitlements had not been appropriately allocated;  that
the standard and cost of road service would be adversely
affected;  that
membership cost and premium rates would increase because of the profit motive;
and that in various ways of the future
control of the NRMA would be
compromised, including that it might become "just another insurance company".
One of the letters suggested
a kind of private listing, and another suggested
that the wealth should be used to reduce subscriptions and widen activities.
<P>

752	According to Mr Rees, at a due diligence committee meeting prior to August
1994, when discussing a draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus, Mr Bateman said
words to the effect -
<P>

"There is no obligation in law to insert into the prospectus a `no' case like
one would find in the documents for a constitutional
referendum.  What is
required is to set out the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and
provide sufficient information so
that members can make an informed decision.
In my opinion we are adequately setting out the advantages and disadvantages of
the proposal
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus and that is all that is required in
law to provide a balanced view of the arguments for and against the
proposal."
<P>

753	The description of what was required is consistent with the other evidence
of what Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman told the NRMA. 
The particular matter in this
evidence was that, according to Mr Rees, Mr Bateman expressed the opinion that
the advantages and disadvantages
were adequately set out.  While Mr Bateman
might have believed that the "no" case so far as was known was canvassed in the
prospectus
(see the notes of 26 July 1994), his opinion that the advantages and
disadvantages of the proposal were adequately set out had to
depend in large
measure on the NRMA's judgment of what the advantages and disadvantages were.
Mr Rees' evidence was difficult to
place in time, and if Mr Bateman had
expressed the particular opinion evidence from others to similar effect would
have been expected.
 It was inconsistent with Mr Bateman's then position that
he would have baldly said that the advantages and disadvantages were adequately
set out, and inconsistent with the probabilities on the evidence as a whole.  I
am not satisfied that Mr Bateman did express that
opinion.
<P>

754	There is no doubt, however, that the consideration of the prospectus at
board and due diligence committee level as it neared
the final version was with
knowledge that it did not contain a "no" case as such, that it had to be
balanced, that it had to provide
members with all information reasonably
necessary to enable them to decide how to vote, that there were disadvantages
in the proposal
to be weighed against advantages, and that dissent from MAG and
others could be expected to take up the disadvantages.  As an illustration,
the
reply over the signature of Mr Willing to the letter from the Labour Council of
New South Wales included that "[u]nder corporate
law, if the directors of NRMA
decide to put the proposal to the members, they have a fiduciary duty to
address all concerns", and
that "[w]e will deal with [members'] concerns - not
purely out of fiduciary responsibility - but because we believe that loyalty
deserves returns not only in dividends, but in a fair and honest assessment of
the share proposal".  The members of the boards and
the due diligence committee
must have been asking themselves whether the advantages and disadvantages were
adequately set out in
the prospectus.  The directors had to identify the
advantages and disadvantages so that they could properly resolve, as they in
due
course did, that the proposal should go to members with their
recommendation.  The adequacy of disclosure was then a matter of judgment.
<P>

<b>Holdings is incorporated</b>
<P>

755	Mr Bateman took the primary role in preparing the documents for and
otherwise attending to the incorporation of Holdings.  The
necessary documents
were sent to Ms Conway on 12 July 1994, and were before the meeting of the
board of Association on 14 July 1994.
 The subscribers signed an undertaking
that Holdings would not trade without the prior approval of Association until
it had been
listed, that they would be the only shareholders until the listing
was to be implemented, and that if there was no listing within
a year their
shares would be transferred to Association or as its board directed.
<P>

756	Holdings was incorporated on 15 July 1994.  Its first board meeting was
held on 18 July 1994, the approved directors took office,
and the subscribers'
shares were allotted.  The existing due diligence committee was appointed to
carry out on Holdings' behalf the
due diligence necessary for the proposal, and
it was resolved that advisers be retained in the same manner as Association and
Insurance
had resolved.  In due course Holdings bought a vehicle, contracted
with Association for road service and became a member of Association,
and
insured the vehicle with Insurance so that it also became a member of
Insurance.  Thus Holdings could be left as the sole member
of Association and
Insurance if all other memberships were extinguished.  
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed for confirmatory advice</b>
<P>

757	On 15 July 1994 Mr Morgan delivered another brief to
Mr Heydon, seeking his "written confirmation<i>"</i> on two issues.  The
covering letter noted that both issues had been discussed in conference
previously "but because of their importance
we require a written opinion".  
<P>

758	The brief began by outlining the proposal and the framing of the changeover
articles.  The description was in now familiar form
-
<P>

"2.1	Holdings is incorporated and becomes a member of Association and
Insurance.
<P>

2.2	A trust to be known as the NRMA Offer Trust will be established with
Perpetual Trustees Australia Limited as trustee ("the Trustee").
<P>

2.3	A prospectus will be issued and will include notices of meeting and an
explanatory statement for the meetings of members of
each of Association and
Insurance.
<P>

2.4	The members of each of Association and Insurance in general meeting will be
asked to vote on a resolution to change the status
of each of the Association
and Insurance from companies limited by guarantee to companies limited by
shares and guarantee.  The Articles
of each of Association and Insurance will
be amended to include standard provisions concerning the payment of dividends
to members
and the distribution of assets on a winding up to members.
<P>

2.5	The Articles of each of Association and Insurance will include a special
article (the "Changeover Article") which, in effect,
provides that on a
specified date, assuming the vote of members of each of Association and
Insurance is in favour of the proposals,
all members other than Holdings will
cease to be members of Association and Insurance and Holdings will issue shares
to those members
or, if the members elect not to take shares or do not respond,
the member will be provided with an interest in the `NRMA Offer Trust'."
<P>

759	It was then said that it was proposed that there be two offers, namely the
Members Free Offer and the Sale Offer.  Further detail
of each were given, with
repetitions of the descriptions Members Free Offer and Sale Offer. 
<P>

760	One of the issues for confirmation was put forward under the heading "The
First Question".  It was said -
<P>

"The structure provides for the shares to be issued by Holdings to be paid up
from the value of the NRMA Group transferred to Holdings
as a result of
Holdings becoming the only member of Association and Insurance after the
existing members have given up their rights
of membership. That is, members
give up their rights as members in consideration of Holdings using the
consideration that flows from
this retirement (the value of the NRMA Group
which is owned solely by Holdings) to pay up the shares issued by Holdings to
members.
<P>

In other words, the paid up capital for the Holdings shares is not subscribed
directly by members or provided by way of dividend.
<P>

Senior Counsel is briefed to advise that the shares to be issued by Holdings to
members may be fully paid up by reason of the consideration
or transfer of
value from members to Holdings by the members agreeing to give up their
membership."
<P>

After some analysis and reference to cases on what constituted consideration,
the AAH view was stated -
<P>

"In the case of the NRMA, the consideration for the relinquishment of
membership is the allotment of shares by Holdings to the (former)
members of
Association and Insurance the value for which derives from the value of the
NRMA Group of which Holdings is the sole member
(prior to the allotment being
made). We do not see a difficulty with this consideration being recognised by
the law."
<P>

761	The other of the issues for confirmation was then put forward under the
heading "The Second Question".  It was said -
<P>

"As you can see from the above it is intended that members of Association and
Insurance will be bound by the proposals through the
contract constituted by
the Articles of each of Association and Insurance (Section 180 of the
Corporations Law).
<P>

We do not see any difficulty in this, assuming of course that the resolutions
are passed by the requisite majority, and seek Senior
Counsel's confirmation of
this."
<P>

762	The first question was the paid-up shares question on which Mr Heydon had
advised in conference on 29 April 1994.  On one view
he second question
encompassed the question of non-responding members on which Mr Heydon had
advised in conference on 7 March 1994,
but in reality it was wider and extended
to whether all members would be bound by the proposals if the resolutions were
passed by
the requisite majority, not just non-responding members.  Mr Heydon
had not advised in conference, without written confirmation,
on that wider
aspect of the question.  
<P>

763	The NRMA suggested that the second question had the wider scope, and was a
further occasion for attention to <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  Its case did not,
however, include that the Gambotto advice should have been given at this time -
the case in this respect was
that the advice should have been given earlier, so
as to affect the NRMA's conduct on 17 March 1994 or at the very latest at the
first board meeting after the hearing of the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>
on 21 April 1994, in that the proposal would then have been put on hold.  The
point of the NRMA's suggestion was not entirely clear,
and this occasion for a
written opinion should be seen as part of the overall course of events for the
light it sheds on the defendants'
conduct.  
<P>

764	Why did Mr Morgan brief Mr Heydon for the written opinion?  Mr Morgan said
that he wanted the questions "finally answered by
Mr Heydon, particularly the
one regarding the method of members' resolution", but that only takes the
question one remove:  why did
Mr Morgan want the questions finally answered by
Mr Heydon, and why particularly the second question?  It is necessary, I think,
to go back in time, to the setting up of the due diligence committee in late
March 1994.  
<P>

765	Mr Rees asked the advisers (BT, C&amp;L, AAH, AT, and DTT) to prepare a
short list of the major issues for consideration in
the due diligence process,
describing them as those matters which were material and had not yet been
resolved.  Mr Bateman prepared
a list, one item on which was -
<P>

"3.  <u>Procedure to Achieve Listing</u>
<P>

Residual doubts about the proposed process have to be removed.  Major doubt for
areas to be satisfied are:
<P>

(a)	each of Association and Insurance ceases to have any members by virtue of
the passing of a special resolution at the 12 October
meeting of members;
<P>

(b)	no oppression is going to occur;
<P>

(c)	shares to be issued by HoldCo to former members (of each of Association and
Insurance) are credited as fully paid (no expenditure
by them)."
<P>

He presented the document to the meeting of the due diligence committee on 30
March 1994.  
<P>

766	According to Mr Bateman, the item reflected his continued concern that the
members' resolutions route was appropriate, relevantly
in two respects:  that
the resolutions would be effective to determine memberships, and that no
oppression would occur.  He considered
that the due diligence process should
include reaching satisfaction that neither presented a material issue.  
<P>

767	Still according to Mr Bateman, at the meeting of the due diligence
committee on 11 July 1994, prompted by review of the Interim
Due Diligence
Report - Legal, he raised what the minutes of the meeting recorded as his
statement "that the change in membership
status of members of the Association
should be noted as a material matter".  He said that the due diligence process
was to remove
doubts about the procedure for achieving listing, and -
<P>

"In particular, doubtful areas which had to be covered include how each of
Association and Insurance ceases to have any members
by virtue of the passing
of a special resolution, as opposed to a scheme of arrangement.  In other
words, can the change of status
of a member of Association be achieved by a
resolution of members adopting a new set of articles, as distinct from a court
approved
scheme of arrangement.  This is not referred to in the interim report
on due diligence on legal matters.  It is a material matter
that has to be
addressed.  Another matter is how Holdings is able to pay up its shares when it
issues them to those former members
of Association and Insurance."
<P>

Mr Morgan then said that those were matters upon which he had briefed Mr Heydon
and "we will be getting him to sign-off on them".
 
<P>

768	Mr Morgan did not recall Mr Bateman saying these things, or anything to the
effect that there was doubt that the proposal could
be implemented by way of
special resolutions of members as distinct from a scheme of arrangement.
According to Mr Morgan, he wanted
confirmation that Mr Heydon's earlier opinion
that the proposal could be implemented by resolutions in general meetings still
applied
to the proposal in its final form, and the operative consideration was
not doubt as to the procedure or putting a material matter
at rest, but that
final form of the proposal had now been arrived at.  He did say that it was
possible, although he did not recall
it, that at the meeting of 11 July 1994
there was discussion about obtaining a further opinion from Mr Heydon to
confirm that the
proposal in its final form could be implemented by resolutions
in general meeting so that a scheme of arrangement was unnecessary.
 
<P>

769	No one else at the meeting of 11 July 1994 could add to these
recollections.  The list and the minutes of the meeting support
Mr Bateman's
evidence, and I accept it.  In my view, Mr Morgan wanted the questions finally
answered by Mr Heydon so that, in the
due diligence process, it could be said
that there was no occasion for reserving or expressing doubt about proceeding
by the members'
resolutions route rather than the scheme of arrangement route
or about the question of paid up shares.  That does not mean that Mr
Morgan
doubted either matter, although he may also have had in mind that, with the
development of the proposal since late 1993 and
early 1994, it would be as well
to obtain the confirmation to which the brief referred.  That he had no doubt
about proceeding by
the members' resolutions route is perhaps indicated by its
truncated treatment in the brief.  Mr Bateman, on the other hand, still
had
doubt about the members' resolutions route, although he did not elaborate his
doubt.
<P>

770	Mr Heydon provided an opinion dated 28 July 1994.  He framed two
questions as the effect of the questions asked in the brief
of 15 July 1994.
<P>

771	The first question framed by Mr Heydon was -
<P>

<u>1.	May the shares to be issued be issued by Holdings to members of
Association and Insurance fully paid up by reason of consideration
in the form
of the members agreeing to give up their membership of those companies?</u>"
<P>

772	Mr Heydon answered the question in the affirmative.  He began his
answer -
<P>

"Ford, <u>Principles of Corporations Law</u> (6th edition), paragraph 821,
says:
<P>

`The Corporations Law implicitly requires that a limited company will not issue
shares gratuitously but only in return for something
of value to the company;
something which will help to constitute the fund to which the creditors give
credit.'
<P>

In short, the point of issuing shares is to obtain share capital, and the
expression `share capital' implies something of value.
Whether or not Ford's
statement is true (and I am not questioning it), there is no doubt that under
the proposal the shares in Holdings
are not being issued gratuitously, but are
issued in return for something of value to Holdings, namely the ability to
obtain access
to the underlying wealth of Insurance and Association which will
flow from the other members of those companies ceasing to be members."
<P>

773	After discussion of the cases, Mr Heydon concluded -
<P>

"In my opinion consideration - `money's worth' -  equal to the par value, or
par value plus premium, of the shares in Holdings allotted
to the members of
Association and Insurance can be found in principle in the relinquishment by
those members of their membership
rights, thereby rendering the membership of
Holdings in those two companies much more valuable. It must be of `some value
in the
eye of the law' for Holdings to become sole controller of the economic
value - on any view worth many millions of dollars -  locked
in
Association and Insurance. The difficult task will be to ensure that an
appropriate relationship between the value to Holdings
represented by the
members' relinquishment of rights and the money value of the shares in Holdings
issued to the members for which
they pay no cash. On the traditional law apart
from s 232 bona fides will suffice; s 232 will require as well
diligence and care;
Lord Greene MR may require not merely an attempt in
good faith to achieve success using diligence and care, but actual success,
though
it is thought this goes too far."
<P>

Echoes of Mr Heydon's advice on the goodwill question can be seen in the
explanation of the difficult task.
<P>

	The second question framed by Mr Heydon was -
<P>

"<u>2.	Will the members of Association and Insurance be bound by the proposals
through the contract constituted by the respective Articles
of each company
under s 180 of the Corporations Law?</u>"
<P>

774	This also was answered in the affirmative, in a brief paragraph.
Mr Heydon said -
<P>

"The statutory contract created by s 180(1) to which a member is party is
an unusual one in that in certain respects, unlike normal
contracts, it can be
varied without the consent of the member. Section 180(3) indicates certain
respects in which the contract may
not be varied. Section 180(3)(a) and (c) do
not apply, and part of s 180(3)(b) does not apply, because the companies
are not companies
in which the liability of members is limited by shares. And
the changes do not increase the liability of members to pay money, hence
the
other part of s 180(3)(b) does not apply. the contract constituted by the
Articles can thus be varied by amending the Articles.
That requires a special
resolution (s 176(1)) and it requires the majority to avoid oppression of
the minority. Subject to those
requirements, the answer is `yes'."
<P>

775	According to Mr Morgan, the answer to the second question confirmed Mr
Heydon's previous advice that the proposal could be implemented
by the
approvals in extraordinary general meetings of members of Association and
Insurance of amendments to the articles of those
companies.  Mr Morgan agreed,
however, that he understood at the time that Mr Heydon was not expressing an
opinion about oppression:
 that is clear from the penultimate sentence.
According to Mr Simpson, this answer confirmed his views that a members'
resolution
could bind non-voting or dissenting members to the proposal and that
a scheme of arrangement was unnecessary, so long as it could
not be said that
there was any "unfairness" to members. 
<P>

<b>The Perpetual brief</b>
<P>

776	To this time Mr Heydon had not been provided with a copy of the prospectus
in any of its draft versions.  He had been provided
with drafts of the onsert,
and with an early draft of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a> of the prospectus.  The drafts of the
onsert had referred to free shares in three or four places, but nothing asked
of Mr Heydon
drew or required attention to the use of that phrase.  The draft
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a> of the prospectus had referred to Members Free Offer, but not to
free shares.  In the course of the more recent conferences with
Mr Heydon the
expression "free shares" had been used, as would be expected, and Mr Heydon did
not say that the use of the expression
was inappropriate.  Again, nothing asked
of Mr Heydon drew or required attention to its use.  As part of its case the
NRMA wished
to establish that Mr Heydon was made aware of the use of the
expression in the prospectus itself. 
<P>

777	In July 1994 Mr Heydon was briefed by Mallesons Stephen Jaques on behalf of
Perpetual, the proposed trustee of the NRMA Offer
Trust, to advise on the
protection available to it under s 1011(1)(b) of the Law and otherwise.  The
brief dated 14 July 1994 included
a copy of the draft prospectus.  In its then
form the draft made frequent reference in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> to Free Shares, although
nothing in the observations in the brief drew attention to that.  The
observations put forward the view
that Perpetual could place reasonable
reliance on the report of the due diligence committee without being involved in
the entire
due diligence process itself, and in substance asked Mr Heydon
whether he agreed.  Mr Heydon advised in conference and provided a
written
opinion, but the details were not given in evidence for reasons of client legal
privilege.
<P>

778	The frequent reference to Free Shares in the prospectus was there to be
seen;  however, hindsight must be put aside and it does
not follow that it
should have been taken in.  Mr Heydon said, and I accept, that the use of the
expression "free shares" in the
onsert (meaning other than as later recounted)
had not been noticed by him, in the sense that while he must have read the
whole of
the document it did not impinge on his consciousness.  The position
was similar with respect to the references to free shares in
the conferences,
as in both cases it was unnecessary for Mr Heydon to give consideration to the
use of the expression.  According
to Mr Heydon, it was the same with respect to
the draft prospectus in the brief from Mallesons Stephen Jaques.  He explained
that
the subject matter for his advice caused him to go through the prospectus
quickly, to identify areas in which Perpetual was committing
itself directly
and areas in which it was relying on the knowledge of others.  He said that it
was unnecessary for him to do more,
and that he did not do more.  I accept Mr
Heydon's evidence in this respect, and that he did not become aware of the
frequent references
to Free Shares in the draft prospectus. 
<P>

<b>Ms Singleton's query </b>
<P>

779	I have already referred to the joint meeting of the boards of Association
and Insurance held on 21 July 1994.  Present as the
Association board were
Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Ms Ralph, Mrs Callaghan,
Mr Douglas, Mr Farr-Jones, Mr Jack, Dame Leonie Kramer,
Mr Lawson,
Ms Singleton, Mr Talbot, Dr Vanderfield, and
Dr Werner.  Present as the Insurance board were Mr Mackay,
Mr Jack, Mr Kirby, Mrs Callaghan,
Mr Corrigan,
Mr Douglas, Mr Easson, Mr Farr-Jones, Ms Singleton, and
Mr Willing.  Those in attendance included Ms Conway and Mrs
Storrs.
Neither Mr Morgan nor Mr Bateman was in attendance.  
<P>

780	Although the minutes did not record it, in discussion at the meeting Dame
Leonie Kramer, Ms Singleton, and Mr Easson raised
queries in relation to
the onsert.  
<P>

781	Dame Leonie's query seems to have been to do with appointing a member as a
proxy.  Mrs Storrs raised it with Mr Bateman after
the meeting, and
Mr Bateman said the proxy form should stay as it was.  Mrs Storrs raised
it also with Ms Conway after the meeting,
and Ms Conway was of the
same view.  That matter did not go further.  
<P>

782	Ms Singleton's query did go further.  It was recalled differently by
those present at the meeting, as I will shortly indicate,
but the file notes of
Mrs Storrs and Mr Bateman seem to me to provide the best guidance as to what it
was.  
<P>

783	Following on from noting her enquiry of Ms Conway just mentioned, Mrs
Storrs recorded -
<P>

"She [Ms Conway] asked that I get advice from Greg Bateman and John Morgan as
to Jane Singleton's issue as to the legality of placing
the acceptance form and
proxy on the same page in relation to inducement to vote.
<P>

<u>Attending Greg Bateman</u>. I advised that we require written advice
concerning Jane Singleton's concerns. He said he would speak to Dyson Heyden
[sic] to get
written advice. He did not see any problem with it."
<P>

784	Mr Bateman's file note of what must have been the same communication
read -
<P>

"- opinion `Are there any legal issues arising from place of Acceptance &amp;
Proxy on the one form' ie attempting to induce people
to vote `yes'.  Its a
carrot.  
<P>

+ wording on front of carrier - any legal issues in same way".
<P>

It will be seen that Mr Bateman's note referred to "wording on front of
carrier" as well as to the placement of the proxy and acceptance
form, where
Mrs Storrs' note referred only to the placement of proxy and acceptance form.
From what follows, Ms Singleton's query
had the wider scope, but was still to
do with the placement of the wording on the first page of the onsert.
<P>

785	As I have said, Ms Singleton's query was recalled differently by those
present at the meeting, and many of the recollections
were little more than
impressions.  As on other matters, that is not unexpected.  Not everyone
present at the meeting who gave evidence
provided a recollection.
<P>

786	Mr Kirby remembered Ms Singleton asking whether the word `free' could be
construed as an enticement, saying he assumed that
it was in connection with
the prospectus, and that the answer from Mr Mackay was that an opinion would be
obtained;  he thought the
matter was dealt with by the changes to the onsert
including the qualification with the asterisk, to which I will come, and he
recalled
Ms Conway saying that the word had to be qualified to avoid any
possible ambiguity in understanding it.  At another point Mr Kirby
said that he
construed Ms Singleton's query as referring to the whole prospectus and onsert,
not just the onsert, and that Ms Singleton
was questioning the use of the word
`free' in the prospectus and the onsert, and that he thought the QC's opinions
which were being
obtained were all concerned with the use of the word `free'.

<P>

787	Mr Jack remembered Ms Singleton raising a query about the onsert, could not
remember what it was, but thought "it was in the
context of the proxy form and
whether or not you wanted the shares".  He did not recall discussion about the
use of the word "free"
on the onsert, but recalled discussion about the use of
the word "free" and did not recall it as focussing on the onsert.  His
recollection
was that the use of the word "free" was queried, that they were
advised that it was acceptable, and that it was used frequently within
the
prospectus to differentiate the free shares from the other shares because there
were several other classes of shares.  
<P>

788	Ms Ralph recalled Ms Singleton expressing concerns about the word "free",
although it is not clear that Ms Ralph had in mind
the meeting of 21 July 1994.
Her recollection was that the thrust of Ms Singleton's concern was that the
word had "run into difficulties
in other contexts ... for example, `buy one get
one free', that sort of thing".  No one else recalled Ms Singleton raising this
concern,
and from Ms Ralph's later evidence it seems that she thought Ms
Singleton's query was to do with the onsert, and that she simply
linked it with
the later disappearance of the word `free' and therefore thought that the query
was about the word `free'.  
<P>

789	Mrs Callaghan said that the query was probably about whether the word free
was appropriate.  Mrs Callaghan was not a particularly
satisfactory witness, in
many areas her evidence was influenced by reconstruction, and I am satisfied
that this recollection is unreliable.
<P>

790	In my view all these recollections were, and were expressed in ways
demonstrating that they were, of egregious uncertainly.
 They ran together Ms
Singleton's query and other events to do with use of the word "free", including
events only later ascertained,
and should not be accepted as correct
recollections.  
<P>

791	Mr Rees' description was that Ms Singleton "had an issue with the
juxtaposition of some words on I think it was the proxy form".
 Mr Corrigan's
recollection was that the broad issue was whether having the combination of the
voting paper and the free shares acceptance
together might influence people to
vote in a particular way.  
<P>

792	Ms Conway recalled the query as concern about the possibility of there
being an inducement to vote by reason of the wording
on the onsert, accepting
that in that context Ms Singleton referred to the word "free" and that her
query included a query as to
whether the use of the word "free" amounted to an
inducement because of the juxtaposition of the two phrases.  Ms Conway said
that
"she [Ms Singleton] was concerned, as I recall it, that there was - the
form had the voting aspect as well as the acceptance of shares
aspect combined
and she was concerned whether or not the formulation, which I can't recall,
`How many free shares you will get' or
something of that nature would induce
because of the two forms being together - would induce a member to vote yes for
the proposal."
 Mrs Storrs, whose file note I have set out, said that two
issues were raised.  One was whether or not the use of the word "free"
on the
carrier was an inducement for people to vote, and the second was that the
placing of the acceptance of free shares form and
the proxy form on the same
page could be seen as misleading in that people might think they had to vote in
order to get the shares.
 The recollections of Ms Conway and Mrs Storrs
differed in relation to whether the use of the word "free" on the carrier, in
itself
as distinct from because of its juxtaposition with voting, was a matter
of concern.
<P>

793	Assistance may be gained from what was said by Mrs Storrs to Mr Bateman on
21 July 1994, and from later conversations between
Mr Bateman and Ms Conway.
<P>

794	I have set out both file notes of the conversation between Mrs Storrs and
Mr Bateman.  According to Mr Bateman, Mrs Storrs said
to him, "I have been
asked to have you brief Dyson Heydon on the question `Are there any legal
issues arising from the placement
of the acceptance of shares and the proxy on
the one form'";  Mr Bateman asked, `What sort of legal issues do you mean?';
and Mrs
Storrs replied, "I'm not entirely clear on this, but I think the
question `Are there any legal issues arising from the placement
of the
acceptance of shares and the proxy on the one form' is asking, is it attempting
to induce people to vote yes.  In other words,
is it a carrot?  We also want an
opinion on the wording on the front of the carrier.  Do any legal issues arise
in the same way?
 Is it an attempt to induce people to vote yes?"  Mr Bateman
read these questions back to her as recorded in his file note.  Mrs
Storrs
evidence of the conversation was less precise, but seemed to give the wider
scope to her instructions to Mr Bateman, referring
to instructions to obtain
advice "about the questions which Jane Singleton had raised at the board
meeting as to whether there were
any legal implications of the use of the words
`Free Shares' on the cover of the onsert".  
<P>

795	The opinion in response to Ms Singleton's query had not been obtained
by the meeting of the board steering committee on 25 July
1994.  Present
as the members of the committee were Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby,
Mr Burrows, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Jack, Dr Werner, and
Mr Willing.
 Those in attendance included Ms Conway.  The minutes
recorded reference to proposed 8 August 1994 meetings of the boards for final
prospectus approval, and shortly thereafter, "Ray Kirby commented on the onsert
form design.  Helen Conway is seeking legal advice
from a QC."  What was said
about the onsert form design was unclear from the evidence, and I am not
satisfied that it went beyond
Ms Singleton's query.  
<P>

796	But this seems to have led to Ms Conway herself raising Ms Singleton's
query with Mr Bateman at a meeting attended by both of
them (but not
Mr Morgan) on 26 July 1994:  it was the meeting mentioned in
connection with the "no" case.  At the beginning of the
meeting Ms Conway said
to Mr Bateman that Ms Singleton had asked a question "about the wording on the
front of the form" and the
fact that the acceptance of shares was on the proxy,
and said that an answer was needed from Mr Heydon by 3 August for the board
meeting on 4 August.  Mr Bateman's file note of the meeting recorded this
as -
<P>

	"Jane Singleton question: need answer by
<P>

	 Front of form wording
<P>

	 +
<P>

	 Fact that Acceptance is on Proxy"
<P>

It then noted a number of matters to do with the proposal as "Issues that will
emerge", including the issue "Forms:
<P>

  inducement to vote".
<P>

797	Later on 26 July 1994 Mr Bateman had a telephone conversation with
Ms Conway.  Mr Bateman said that Mrs Storrs had not been
entirely clear
about the two questions, and asked for clarification.  He stated the questions
on which Mr Heydon's opinion was required,
and Ms Conway agreed that they were
the questions.  The questions he stated were recorded in his file note of the
conversation -
<P>

"Lisa away: Jane Singleton's question includes the front cover
<P>

...
<P>

Are there any legal issues arising from the placing of the Acceptance of Free
Shares [and] the Proxy on the one form eg by attempting
to induce people to
vote `yes'
<P>

+
<P>

Are there any legal issues arising from front of carrier which says `Free
Shares' &amp; `vote'.
<P>

Ms Conway agreed that she had a later discussion with Mr Bateman to "check the
formulation of the questions", and did not dispute
what Mr Bateman said in this
respect.
<P>

798	With the assistance of these later events, I think that Mrs Storrs'
recollection should not be accepted so far as it was that
Ms Singleton
questioned in itself the use of the word "free" on the first page of the
onsert.  I consider that the query was directed
to the conjunctions of voting
and acceptance of free shares on the third page of the onsert and of free
shares and voting on the
first page of the onsert, in both instances the
concern being that the conjunction could be seen as an inducement to vote yes.
It
may be added that this is confirmed by what appears to be a note of the
meeting made by Mr Talbot, it seems a habitual note-taker,
relevantly stating
"Jane asked to be supplied with legal advice on closeness of share offer and
vote".
<P>

799	Mr Easson gave evidence that, as a separate matter from Ms Singleton's
query, at the meeting of 21 July 1994 he queried whether
the conjunction of
words on the first page of the onsert "might have been leading members to a
conclusion that they were getting
something no matter what, no matter how they
voted", and that he asked for an opinion on that also.  There was no other
evidence
of such a query by Mr Easson, although there is some support for his
having raised a concern separate from, but related to, Ms Singleton's
query in
the events at the joint board meeting of Association and Insurance on 18 August
1994 to which I will come.  Mr Easson also
recalled Ms Singleton's query as
referring to the prospectus and the onsert as a whole, which I do not think is
correct.  His own
concern was only as to the words on the first page of the
onsert.
<P>

800	Possibly Mr Easson did raise his own query, but it was not seen by Ms
Conway as something materially different from Ms Singleton's
query and was not
separately taken up when Mr Bateman was instructed to get advice.  It is
likely, I think, that Mr Easson's query
was raised a little later, see as to
the notations on the 27 July 1994 version of the onsert mentioned a little
later in these reasons.
<P>

801	A 22 July 1994 version of the onsert differed in some respects from that
which had gone to Mr Heydon on 6 July 1994, and was
the subject of his opinion
of 20 July 1994.   The differences included as to the layout of the logo and
words on the first page,
the marginal note on the first page added after 6 July
1994, the layout of the second page, and reference to "Free Shares" rather
than
"free shares" or "the free shares" on the second page.  A later version of 27
July 1994 differed, although slightly, even from
the version as at 22 July
1994.  
<P>

802	The 27 July 1994 version was before a meeting of the board of Holdings held
on 28 July 1994.  Those present as the board were
Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby,
Mrs Callaghan, Mr Jack and Mr Willing, and those in attendance
included Dr Werner, Ms Godwin, and Mr Bateman.
 The minutes
recorded -
<P>

"A copy of the most recent edition of the proposed onsert forms was circulated
and discussed.
<P>

The Board resolved, subject to the amendments discussed at the meeting, to
approve the wording, layout and form of:
<P>

(a)	the carrier page;
<P>

(b)	the reverse side of the carrier page outlining instructions; and
<P>

(c)	the form entitled `Acceptance of Free Shares'
<P>

The Board further resolved to authorise management to make any minor amendments
of form (rather than substance) which may be required
arising out of the
printing process."
<P>

803	At the joint board meeting later the same day, according to the minutes and
immediately before the minutes concerning the "no"
case -
<P>

"The most recent edition of the proposed onsert forms was tabled.
<P>

The forms were discussed and changes were suggested to management for its
further consideration."
<P>

The only indication of what suggestions for management might have been made is
that some copies in evidence of the onsert as at
27 July 1994 had notations to
the line on the first page, "How many FREE shares you will get!", suggesting
that the word "will" had
come under consideration, that Mr Easson had proposed
"can", and that Ms Singleton had proposed "may".  It does not seem that
Ms
Singleton repeated her query, or that there was any express reference
to counsel's advice in relation to that query:  perhaps it
was understood that
the advice was coming and there was no point in reiteration.  The notations are
consistent with Mr Easson's separate
query, and this is likely to have been the
occasion on which Mr Easson raised it rather than 21 July 1994.  If so, it is
perhaps
understandable that no one else gave evidence of Mr Easson's separate
query.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon is briefed on Ms Singleton's query</b>
<P>

804	Mr Bateman asked Mr Heydon for his advice by a letter dated 28
July 1994.  
<P>

It read -
<P>

"We refer to previous discussions.
<P>

We need Counsel's short written opinion on a matter by no later than Wednesday,
3 August 1994.
<P>

1.	<b><u>Form of Prospectus</u></b>
<P>

As you know, it is intended that the prospectus to be issued by NRMA Holdings
Limited will be sent in package [sic] to members of
NRMA Limited (`<u>the
Association</u>') and NRMA Insurance Limited (`<u>NRMA Insurance</u>') and that
this package will comprise:
<P>

(a)	a 100 page (or so) bound document;
<P>

(b)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 1</a> of that bound document will contain the Notice of general meeting
for the Association, the Notice of general meeting for NRMA Insurance
and a 10
page `Information for Members' which relates directly to the resolution to be
considered by each of those meetings;
<P>

(c)	the prospectus will be sent through the post in plastic wrap and inside the
plastic wrap will also be an `onsert'. That onsert
will be customised and
personalised to show the name and address of the member of the Association or
member of NRMA Insurance, as
the case may be. The most common form of onsert is
enclosed. It is the latest version of the onsert upon which Counsel has been
asked
to advise on previous occasions.
<P>

2.	<b><u>Opinion sought from Counsel</u></b>
<P>

One of the directors of the Association has asked that a written opinion be
obtained on the following:
<P>

(a)	Counsel is asked to confirm that there are no legal issues arising from the
placement of the Acceptance of Free Shares form
on the Proxy Voting Papers.
<P>

	Could it be suggested, for example, that that [sic] if this was regarded as an
attempt to induce people to vote `yes', that it
was an unfair inducement with
legal ramifications?
<P>

(b)	Counsel is asked to confirm that there are no legal issues arising from
having on the first page `How to vote!' in combination
with `How many FREE
shares you will get!'.
<P>

	Could it be suggested, for example, that if this was regarded as an attempt to
induce people to vote `yes', that is an unfair inducement
with legal
ramifications?
<P>

3.	<b><u>Our View</u></b>
<P>

We do not believe that there is any such inducement.
<P>

The Proxy Voting Papers make it very clear that there is a choice as to whether
you vote `yes' or `no'. The Acceptance of Free Shares
form, under its heading,
clearly states that even if the person has voted `no', they should complete the
Acceptance of Free Shares
form. Again, the instruction sheet, at the first dot
point against `remember to check' emphasises that regardless of whether the
person votes they should fill in the Acceptance of Free Shares form.
<P>

The issuing of the onsert is subject to a range of controls, including:
<P>

(a)	the general law, including the law relating to the holding of meetings and
providing fair information to members;
<P>

(b)	the Corporations Law, including Chapter 7 dealing with prospectuses;
<P>

(c)	the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, including its comprehensive provision in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
52.</a>
<P>

Having considered these issues, we do not believe that there are any legal
implications arising from the placing of the Acceptance
of Free Shares form on
the Proxy Voting Papers. Nor do we believe that there are any legal
implications arising from the major wording
on the front of the onsert.
<P>

We would be pleased if Counsel would consider the matter and provide a short
written opinion on the matter.
<P>

4.	<b><u>Urgency</u></b>
<P>

As the matter is to be considered by the relevant board of directors on
Thursday, 4 August 1994, we would appreciate Counsel's written
opinion by the
close of business on <u>Wednesday, 3 August 1994</u>."
<P>

805	The version of the onsert enclosed with the letter was not entirely clear,
but seems to have been the situation 3 onsert in
its 22 July 1994 version.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon's opinion of 2 August 1994</b>
<P>

806	Mr Heydon responded to the letter of 28 July 1994 on
2 August 1994.  He prepared and dictated his opinion on 1 August 1994 and
possibly the morning of 2 August 1994.  
<P>

807	Early on 2 August 1994 he telephoned Mr Bateman.  Mr Bateman's
file note of the conversation read, "FREE shares is a problem.
 `How to choose
Shares or Cash!'".  
<P>

808	The written opinion became available during the morning.  It occupied five
pages, but only part of it need be set out.  
<P>

809	After introductory reference to the onsert, Mr Heydon set out as a
question the matter in para 2(a) of the letter of 28 July
1994;  he
then set out para 3 of the letter down to "Proxy Voting Papers" in the
fourth-last line, the part of the letter in which
Mr Bateman had expressed
his view on that matter.  
<P>

810	Mr Heydon said that he agreed.  He observed that the benefit of receiving
shares in Holdings or cash was no doubt a strong inducement
to vote yes, but
that that would be so whether the Acceptance of Free Shares form appeared on
the same page as the Proxy Voting Paper
or not, and that it was difficult to
see why any greater incentive in favour of a yes vote flowed from the proposed
placement.  After
reference to authority, he said -
<P>

"Even if the documents were read quickly, and by a non-specialist, they do not
mislead, and they contain adequate information to
convey the point that the
member has two choices - to indicate how, if a proxy is to be employed, the
proxy is to vote for or against
the changes, and to indicate, even if the proxy
vote is negative, whether the member is to get shares or cash in the event that
there
is a sufficiently large positive majority. I do not see how that point
could be put more clearly. I certainly do not think that the
form could create
`some serious misapprehension of the position'."
<P>

811	Mr Heydon then set out as a question the matter in para 2(b) of the
letter of 28 July 1994, and in his answer to that question
was the problem
noted by Mr Bateman from the telephone conversation early on 2 August
1994.  The question and what followed it were
-
<P>

"`2.	Are there any legal issues arising from having on the first page `How to
vote' in combination with `How many FREE shares you
will get!'? Could it be
suggested, for example, that if this were regarded as an attempt to induce
members to vote `yes', that is
an unfair inducement with legal
ramifications?'
<P>

While I do not think this will necessarily be held to be an attempt to induce
members to vote `yes', it may be; and in any event
there are two other reasons
why I think that the words should be changed.
<P>

The first reason concerns their inaccuracy as an indication of what the member
must do; the second concerns the ambiguity or worse
of the word `FREE'.
<P>

The essential activities to which the onsert is directed are
<P>

(a)	voting on the proposals;
<P>

(b)	choice between shares and cash in the event that 75% of the votes are
affirmative.
<P>

The present words do not indicate accurately that the member must choose
between shares and cash. A better expression might be `How
to choose shares or
cash!'.
<P>

The word "FREE" has been removed from that formulation. There is an important
sense in which the shares are not `free': they are
not free because the members
are giving up rights and Holdings is gaining greater power in the Association
and NRMA Insurance. Indeed
if the shares were free the entire transaction would
be at risk, because the shares will have a par value, and perhaps a premium;
under the general law to issue the shares free would be to issue them at a
discount, which is unlawful. Hence it is technically quite
wrong to call the
shares `FREE' even though it is true that no money need be paid for them; so
that in that sense it is true to call
them free. If the words `How many FREE
shares you will get!' became `How to choose shares or cash!', or words to that
effect, I do
not believe that any legal issue would arise likely to be decided
adversely to NRMA. As indicated in answer to question 1, any tendency
of the
proposed words to operate as an inducement to vote `yes' would not operate to
any greater extent than the inherent tendency
of the proposal; and the form
makes it plain at two points that while it is possible to vote `no', it is
desirable for a person voting
no to choose between shares and cash, since a
75%<i> </i>majority may vote yes."
<P>

812	The link with Mr Bateman's note of his early morning telephone conversation
with Mr Heydon is plain.  On one view Mr Heydon
went beyond the question asked
of him, as the question addressed the combination of the two phrases "How to
vote" and "How many FREE
shares you will get!".  
<P>

813	Mr Heydon explained, however, that he considered that the letter of 28 July
1994 in substance raised two questions.  One turned
on the fear that members
might think they could only obtain the shares if they voted in favour of the
resolutions, that is, that
they might think that even if the requisite majority
were received they would not get any shares unless they voted in favour.  He
saw that question as related to the placement of the Acceptance of Free Shares
form on the proxy form, that is, at the bottom of
the third page of the onsert.
The other question was that of legal issues arising from having on the first
page the phrase "How to
vote!" in combination with the phrase "How many FREE
Shares you will get!", and to answer that question he had to consider what each
phrase meant.  This, Mr Heydon said, was the first occasion on which a request
had been made to him directing his attention to the
description of the shares
as free shares, and the recent advice to Mr Morgan, Mr Pearce and Mr Barry on
26 July 1994 turned his mind
to the senses in which the shares were or were not
free.  The advice had been on an aspect of the goodwill question, involved in
which was the value of what Holdings got in return for issuing the shares, and
that can be seen in the opinion of 2 August 1994.
<P>

814	There was some attention in these proceedings to how Mr Heydon's opinion
should be read.  That will be better understood with
knowledge of further
events, and can be addressed together with Mr Heydon's opinion of 3 August
1994:  see later in these reasons.
 
<P>

<b>The events of 2 August 1994</b>
<P>

815	Mr Heydon's opinion of 2 August 1994 caused quite a stir.  The extent of
divergence in recollection of what happened was quite
remarkable.  For more
intelligible exposition, I will break the events of 2 August 1994 into the
three areas of (a) the morning conversations;
 (b) before the afternoon
meeting;  (c) the afternoon meeting until Mr Heydon was telephoned;  and (d)
the telephone call to Mr Heydon,
but the events and their outcome should be
seen as a whole.
<P>

	(a)  <u>The morning conversations</u>
<P>

816	Mr Bateman's note of his early morning telephone conversation with Mr
Heydon placed it at 8.50am, and it is probable that Mr
Heydon telephoned Mr
Bateman to tell him that the opinion had been completed and would shortly be
available. 
<P>

817	According to Mr Heydon, he said to Mr Bateman -
<P>

"I have done the opinion you wanted on the onsert.  It will be available in the
course of the morning.  The use of the term `free
shares' is a problem on the
front page of the onsert.  In one sense the shares aren't free;  if they were,
they would be being issued
at a discount and that would be unlawful."
<P>

Something was probably said about clarifying the need for members to indicate a
choice between shares or cash, and about arranging
for the opinion to get to Mr
Bateman.
<P>

818	According to Mr Bateman, there was more in the conversation.  His
recollection was that Mr Heydon said -
<P>

"I have done the opinion on the onserts and I am sending it to you.  The use of
the term `free shares' is a problem on the front
of the onserts.  I have
suggested that the wording should be `How to choose shares or cash".  You will
see what I've suggested in
the opinion.  One of the problems is that the cash
alternative is not referred to on the front cover.  The other problem is that,
technically, the shares aren't free.  Otherwise, as you know, we have the
problem we have discussed concerning paying up the shares."
<P>

Mr Bateman asked whether there were other ways of addressing the problem, and
Mr Heydon said -
<P>

"I'm not a draftsman, and I'm sure there are other ways of covering the issue.
There must be people down at the NRMA who can come
up with the right thing.
The alternative wording in my written opinion is just a suggestion.  The
important thing is to qualify `free
shares' in some way where it first appears.
You could use an asterisk, or some other device next to `free', for example,
and note
that members are giving up their rights.  I'll leave that to the
designers."
<P>

819	The first part of the conversation as recalled by Mr Bateman was much the
same as the conversation recalled by Mr Heydon, but
it seems clear enough from
Mr Bateman's note that there was reference to a suggested alternative wording.
Mr Heydon did not think
that he said anything about paying up the shares, as he
had not discussed that problem with Mr Bateman and did not know the extent
to
which Messrs Morgan and Bateman were informing each other of their separate
communications with him.  He did not remember the
second part of the
conversation as recalled by Mr Bateman, but did not deny that Mr Bateman may
have asked if there was another way
of addressing the problem.  
<P>

820	In these proceedings the NRMA placed some reliance on Mr Heydon saying that
"free shares" should be qualified where it first
appeared.  Its point was, as I
understand it, that if he said that then Mr Heydon must have appreciated that
"free shares" was used
later in the onsert and, although this was disclaimed at
one stage, was used in the prospectus.  Mr Heydon probably did appreciate
at
the time that "free shares" was used later in the onsert - after all, it was
used for the Acceptance of Free Shares form also
the subject of his advice.
There was other evidence of reference on the phrase when it first appeared, and
supporting Mr Heydon referring
to possible alternatives and qualification with
an asterisk.  It would have been natural for Mr Heydon to have said what Mr
Bateman
recalled, and I accept that he did.  I do not think, however, that Mr
Heydon thereby revealed an appreciation of the use of "free
shares" in the
prospectus.
<P>

821	Mr Bateman spoke to Ms Conway on some other matters to do with the proposal
at 9.20 am.  Mr Bateman had no recollection of whether
or not he passed on to
her what Mr Heydon had told him, saying only that it was likely that he did;
Ms Conway's evidence was to the
contrary.  Some forewarning to Ms Conway of Mr
Heydon's problem with free shares would probably have been reflected in the
accounts
- even the conflicting accounts - of what thereafter happened, but was
not, and on the probabilities I consider that Mr Bateman did
not say anything
to Ms Conway.  
<P>

822	The NRMA suggested that this bore a sinister connotation, in that Mr
Bateman was conscious of his own neglect in not seeing
a problem with free
shares and was reluctant to disclose it.  I reject the suggestion.  Mr Bateman
knew he would soon receive the
written opinion, and it is understandable that
he should wait until he had it so that he could pass it on, and assist in
assessing
it and following it through, in an informed way.  When he received
it, he promptly faxed a copy of the opinion to Ms Conway.  The
suggestion was
part of a wider suggestion that Mr Bateman delayed in asking for Mr Heydon's
advice, from 21 July 1994 to 28 July
1994, because of a similar consciousness
of neglect.  I reject that also.  I accept that Mr Bateman wished to clarify
with Ms Conway
the matters on which there should be advice, which he did on 26
July 1994.  He did not act with alacrity, but there was much else
to attend to
and, while time was short, it was not critical - changes in the onsert were
still being made, and Ms Singleton's query
went to placement rather than
full-scale drafting.  
<P>

823	After it became available, Mr Heydon's opinion was faxed by Mr Bateman to
Ms Conway, Mr Barrett and Mr Morgan between 12.00
noon and 12.15 pm.  When and
how the opinion became available was not established.  The faxes provide some
focus for the conflicting
recollections in relation to another morning
conversation.
<P>

824	According to Mr Morgan, on the morning of 2 August 1994 he was at the NRMA
offices attending a meeting.  On leaving the meeting
he saw Ms Conway, Mr
Barrett, and Mr Bateman.  Mr Bateman was holding a fax in his hand.  He said,
"We have just got a fax of Dyson's
opinion", and Ms Conway said, "Look at this.
We have got a problem with the use of the word `free'.  This is not what Heydon
said
in conference.  Bloody Dyson's reneged".  Mr Morgan read the last few
pages of the copy of Mr Heydon's opinion, and said that there
should be a
meeting about it.  He asked for a copy of the opinion to be faxed to his
office, to which he was going.  Ms Conway said
that she would arrange for the
meeting at 2.00 pm.  
<P>

825	Ms Conway did not agree with this.  Her recollection was that Mrs Storrs
told her that Mr Heydon had given an opinion "in which
he has been critical of
the use of the expression `free shares' on the onsert", that this was a matter
of concern, and that Mrs Storrs
said that there was a forms design meeting
proposed for 2.00 pm that day and asked if Ms Conway could attend.  Ms Conway
said she
could.  Ms Conway denied meeting others or saying Mr Heydon had
reneged, asserting that she did not know of any earlier opinion that
Mr Heydon
may have expressed.  She denied that she appointed the meeting for 2.00 pm.
Indeed, Ms Conway said that she had not read
Mr Heydon's opinion before that
meeting, and read it or parts of it during the course of the meeting.  
<P>

826	Nor did Mr Bateman agree with this.  He was unsure about whether he had
spoken to Ms Conway before the meeting at 2.00 pm, but
denied the occasion in
the morning at the NRMA offices and said that Ms Conway's secretary told him
that the meeting was being held.
 
<P>

827	Mr Simpson's evidence included that in early August 1994 he saw Mr Bateman
in the NRMA building, and Mr Bateman said to him,
"Heydon's changed his mind
and got nervous about `free shares'."  Mr Simpson asked what Mr Heydon had
said, but he could not recall
Mr Bateman's answer.  This was not necessarily on
the morning of 2 August 1994.  It is to be contrasted with a later conversation
of which Mr Simpson gave evidence, referring to events on the afternoon of 3
August 1994, but that leaves room for other occasions
when the paths of Mr
Bateman and Mr Simpson crossed.  Mr Bateman denied telling Mr Simpson about a
change of mind and nervousness
of Mr Heydon.
<P>

828	I do not think Mr Simpson's evidence, even if there were a conversation
about a change of mind and nervousness of Mr Heydon,
is particularly helpful in
resolving the conflict between Mr Morgan and Ms Conway and Mr Bateman.  There
may have been a conversation
at some time, and Mr Bateman may have seen a
change of mind from what I earlier concluded may have been a passing remark at
the conference
of 7 March 1994 that the shares were capable of being described
as free, but it is quite uncertain that the conversation was on the
morning of
2 August 1994.  
<P>

829	There are difficulties with all of the recollections.  One difficulty is
that, on the timing of his movements elicited from
Mr Morgan, the conversation
in the morning must have been before 12.00 noon, which is not consistent with
Mr Bateman faxing a copy
of the opinion to Ms Conway at or after that time.
Another difficulty is that Mr Morgan must have learnt of the free shares
problem
before the copy of the opinion was faxed to him, as the evidence of Mrs
Castle to which I will shortly refer demonstrates.  If he
did not learn of it
in the manner he recalled there was no other evidence of how he learnt of it.
Another difficulty is that Ms Conway's
recollection does not sit well with the
fax to her, and Mrs Storrs was unable to support it - indeed, Mr Bateman did
not say that
he conveyed the free shares problem through Mrs Storrs.  Mrs
Storrs' evidence was to the contrary of Ms Conway's recollection, in
that she
recalled Ms Conway talking to her about the 2.00 pm meeting and who would need
to be present, and I am satisfied that it
was not a regular forms design
meeting to which Ms Conway was invited.  Finally (although many other
difficulties could be identified),
it would be curious if Ms Conway had spoken
of Mr Heydon reneging from something said in conference.  She had not been at a
conference
with him.  The only occasion, on the evidence, on which Mr Heydon
might have said something about free shares was the conference
of 2 March 1994,
but there was no evidence of anyone telling Ms Conway of such an occasion, and
Ms Conway denied that she had been
told of it.
<P>

830	The evidence material to this other morning conversation can not be
reconciled.  I am not satisfied that Mr Morgan's account
of the conversation is
correct, or that Ms Conway's account of involvement only via Mrs Storrs is
correct.  I do not think any conclusion
can reliably be reached beyond that in
some manner Ms Conway and Mr Morgan were made aware of the free shares problem
raised by Mr
Heydon, and were provided with faxed copies of the opinion, and
that a meeting was appointed for 2.00 pm on 2 August 1994.  I do
not feel able
to find what happened in any greater detail.  Nor do I think it matters to my
decision.
<P>

(b)  <u>Before the afternoon meeting</u>
<P>

831	Mr Morgan went to Mrs Louise Castle, then a senior associate at AAH whom he
believed was experienced in trade practices matters.
 According to Mr Morgan,
he told her that an opinion had been received from Mr Heydon which said there
might be a problem with the
use of the expression `free shares', and asked her
to get the opinion and "have a look at it" and go with him to the meeting at
2.00
pm "to advise NRMA on our view as to what the consequences of the opinion
are".  He then went to another meeting.  According to Mrs
Castle, late in the
morning of 2 August 1994 Mr Morgan asked if she was free to go to a meeting at
the NRMA at 2.00 pm, and said
that he wanted her to review and comment on an
opinion given by Mr Heydon on the use of the expression "free shares".  Mr
Morgan
outlined the proposal and answered Mrs Castle's questions, and said that
the opinion would be faxed through;  according to Mrs Castle,
he said that Ms
Conway "is pretty mad as apparently Dyson has changed his mind on the meaning
of the word `free'".  A draft of the
onsert was provided, and Mrs Castle
obtained a faxed copy of Mr Heydon's opinion. 
<P>

832	Mrs Castle read the draft onsert and parts of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus,
carried out legal research, and also spoke to Mr Tonking.  She showed Mr
Tonking the onsert and the opinion, and
said that Mr Heydon was right in that
there were two views as to the meaning of the word `free' but that the better
view was that
`free' meant at no dollar cost to the consumer.  She gave her
reasons, and asked what Mr Tonking thought.  According to Mrs Castle,
Mr
Tonking said that he agreed. 
<P>

833	Later in the day, according to Mr Morgan, he read the opinion in more
detail.  He said that he understood Mr Heydon to be expressing
a concern solely
about the onsert.  Mr Morgan considered the onsert separable from the
prospectus, although technically part of it,
and said that he thought that
because members might read the onsert without referring to the prospectus and
seeing the explanation
in the prospectus that they would give up their
membership in return for the shares, it was necessary to explain in the onsert
that
members would be giving up their rights.  In his view, reference to free
shares in the prospectus, where there was the explanation,
was not
objectionable because in substance the use of the expression "free shares" in
the prospectus was already qualified in the
way he understood Mr Heydon
suggested the onsert had to be qualified.  
<P>

834	From this evidence, Mr Morgan gave thought at the time to whether the free
shares problem extended to the prospectus, and concluded
that it did not.  I do
not think I can accept this without reservation.  Mr Heydon had not in his
opinion suggested qualification
by explanation that members would be giving up
their rights.  That had been an alternative in the conversation with Mr
Bateman, but
the opinion did away with free shares altogether and there was no
evidence that Mr Morgan had been told of the alternative by this
time.
<P>

835	Mr Bateman met Mr Morgan and Mrs Castle in the street on the way to the
meeting at 2.00 pm.  Mr Morgan did not recall this,
but accepted that it may
have happened;  Mr Bateman and Mrs Castle agreed that it happened, but differed
in their recollections of
what was said.
<P>

836	According to Mr Bateman, Mr Morgan said -
<P>

"Greg, this is my partner, Louise Castle, she's our <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> expert.
She's coming down with me to the NRMA to sort out Dyson Heydon.  Heydon's just
plain wrong when he says the shares are not
free.  He had no right to say what
he said in the opinion.  He wasn't asked that question.  I tell you mate,
Dyson's just wrong".

<P>

Mr Bateman replied -
<P>

"We asked for the opinion.  Surely, it's fair that he draws our attention to
something.  Anyway, when I spoke to him this morning,
when he told me the
written opinion was on its way, he did say that there could be alternatives to
his wording.  For instance he
said that we could qualify the word `free' with
an asterisk or some other device and tell the members they are giving up their
rights".

<P>

Mr Morgan made comments about the meaning of `free' which Mr Bateman could not
recall, and as they walked along Mrs Castle said,
with an illustration which he
could not recall, "the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, and the cases under it, say that
there can be situations when you can use `free' and I think it is correct to
say that these shares
are `free'."  Mr Morgan said words to the same effect.

<P>

837	Mrs Castle did not recall some of the matters recounted by Mr Bateman, and
denied that Mr Morgan said that she was accompanying
him to "sort out" Mr
Heydon.  She did recall Mr Bateman saying that Mr Heydon had said that there
could be alternatives.  She denied
saying that there were situations under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> when "free" could be used and that she thought it correct
to say that the shares were "free".  According to Mrs Castle, the conversation
included her stating, "What I will be saying at the meeting is that Heydon's
view is open (or technically right, or right), but in
the context I think the
better meaning of the word `free' is at no dollar cost to the consumer.  This
view is supported by the approach
of the TPC in its advertising booklet where
it focuses on the meaning of the word `free' as referring to dollars paid by
the consumer".
<P>

838	Mr Morgan recalled Mr Bateman saying something to the effect that Mr Heydon
had said that there could be alternatives, and that
there could be
qualification with an asterisk and telling the members that they were giving up
their rights, but he placed that at
the commencement of the meeting rather than
in the street.  He denied that at any time he asserted in the language
attributed to
him that Mr Heydon was wrong, or said that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a>, and the cases under it, said that there could be situations where you
could use `free', and he did not recall Mrs Castle saying
that.
<P>

839	The differing recollections were more in the emphasis than the substance.
It is not unlikely that Mr Bateman would have relayed
the content of his early
morning telephone conversation with Mr Heydon, Mrs Castle recalled that he did,
and I think Mr Morgan's
recollection is faulty on that matter.  If Mrs Castle
thought that the better view was that "free" meant at no dollar cost to the
consumer, it is likely that she said that it was correct to describe the shares
as free, and Mr Morgan does not at any time seem
to have dissented from Mrs
Castle's view - he was using her as a person with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> expertise
who had done some research.  Whether Mr Morgan was emphatic in disagreement
with Mr Heydon and thought he had answered
a question he was not asked (which
from what I have set out he may well have thought) does not much matter.  There
was other evidence
supporting that Mr Morgan was fairly blunt in saying that Mr
Heydon was wrong, and without commitment to the precise words recalled
by Mr
Bateman I accept that the thrust of the conversation in the street was as
recounted by Mr Bateman.
<P>

(c)  <u>The afternoon meeting until Mr Heydon was telephoned</u>
<P>

840	Present at the meeting at 2.00 pm were Ms Conway, Mrs Storrs,
Mr Mamutil, Ms Scroope, Mr Barrett, Mr Morgan, Mrs Castle, and
Mr Bateman.  There was dispute over what was said and done.  During the
meeting Mr Heydon was telephoned, and there was also dispute
over the telephone
conversation:  it is dealt with in the next part of these reasons.
<P>

841	File notes of Mrs Storrs and Mr Bateman were in evidence, and it is
convenient to set out what they relevantly record as a framework
for the other
evidence.  
<P>

842	Mrs Storrs' file note included -
<P>

"Discussion as to the issue of Dyson Haydons [sic] advice on the word `free'.
Greg Bateman obtained advice on the phone from Dyson
Haydon [sic] that it would
be acceptable to have a rider in the front of the carrier with words to the
following effect -
<P>

<u>The Free Shares (or cash alternative) are in return for your existing
membership. Road Service and policies continue as usual.</u>
<P>

Greg Bateman to send revised carrier to Dyson Haydon [sic] for his sign-off and
amended advice."
<P>

843	Mr Bateman's file note indicated communication with Mr Heydon
followed by (the punctuation and other anomalies are as in the
original) -
<P>

"'The Free shares (or cash alternative) are in return for your existing
membership.  [rights, other than road service which continues
<P>

		Road services &amp; policies continue 
<P>

		as usual.
<P>

232 6657
<P>

`The Free shares (or cash alternative) are in return for your existing
membership. Road service and policies continue as usual.'
<P>

This goes on front cover, 2 lines above `If undeliverable return to &amp;
horizontal.
<P>

Second opinion from Heydon req by."
<P>

The telephone number was Mr Heydon's telephone number.  
<P>

844	The two file notes indicated that the meeting had arrived at alternative
forms of words for a rider to go on the first page
of the onsert, that Mr
Bateman had telephoned Mr Heydon, that the form of words common to the notes
was thought acceptable, and that
Mr Heydon was to provide another opinion.
<P>

845	According to Mr Bateman, the meeting began with him saying -
<P>

"Dyson Heydon rang me this morning to let me know that his written opinion was
on the way and to tell me that the use of the term
"FREE shares" on the front
of the Carrier was a problem.  He told me that he was suggesting an alternative
phrase, which is set out
in the opinion, namely, `How to choose shares or
cash!'.  He did go on to say that he was not a draftsman and that it was up to
others
to come up with alternative wording.  He said the important thing was to
qualify "Free Shares" in some way, where it first appears.
 He said you could,
for example, use an asterisk or some other device next to "Free Shares" and
then tell the member that he is giving
up his rights'.
<P>

846	Mr Morgan then said, with some anger, "Heydon is now becoming a draftsman.
He wants to change `how many free shares you'll get'
into `how to choose shares
or cash'.  He's got no right to do that."  Ms Conway said, also with some
anger, "I agree.  Dyson was
not asked that question."  Mr Morgan said,
"Heydon's becoming a draftsman", and Ms Conway said, "Yes, he has no right to
do that."
 
<P>

847	Still according to Mr Bateman, both Mr Morgan and Mrs Castle "spoke to the
meeting to similar effect as they had spoken to me
when we walked down Martin
Place to the NRMA", that is, that they spoke of Mr Heydon being wrong, of Mr
Heydon having no right to
say what he said, of situations when "free" could be
used, and of it being correct that the shares were free.  Mr Barrett then said
that he understood that Mr Heydon accepted that they should look at
alternatives, and that they should do so, and there was discussion
of what
should be done to the onsert in the light of Mr Heydon's opinion and in
particular what alternatives might be acceptable
to Mr Heydon.  
<P>

848	Mr Bateman said that he (Mr Bateman) did not express a view on the effect
of the TP Act or how the problem which had been identified
should be overcome,
and that Mr Morgan and Mrs Castle were "expressing legal views in that area".
When an alternative form of wording
was arrived at, Mr Bateman wrote it in his
file note and telephoned Mr Heydon.
<P>

849	Mr Morgan's recollection was less complete.  According to Mr Morgan, he
introduced Mrs Castle as a senior associate specialising
in trade practices.
Mrs Castle said that Mr Heydon had referred to two views as to the meaning of
the word `free', the shares being
free in one sense in that they were issued at
no cost to members but not free in the other sense because members were giving
up their
rights as members in consideration for the shares.  She said, "Dyson
has expressed this view in relation to the onsert and it may
be that we need to
do something about it.  Heydon's view is fairly technical".  She referred to a
publication concerning trade practices.
 Ms Conway then said, "How do we fix
the problem?  This is not what Dyson said in conference".  Mr Bateman said,
"Well, maybe we
can qualify it in some way".  Ms Conway said, "Well let's ring
Dyson", and there was then a telephone call to Mr Heydon.  
<P>

850	Mr Morgan denied that he said anything to the effect that Mr Heydon was now
becoming a draftsman, or wanted to change to the
wording, and had no right to
do that.  His recollection was that Ms Conway said that Mr Heydon was becoming
a draftsman and had no
right to do that.  He said that Mr Barrett took the lead
in looking at alternatives as a course which Mr Heydon said was open, although
he could not recall the discussion about what alternatives might be acceptable
to Mr Heydon.  He acknowledged a recollection that
someone at the meeting asked
whether there was a need to address the problem raised by Mr Heydon in relation
to the prospectus, just
that someone asked, "Does it have any implications for
the prospectus?", and that he replied that the prospectus was different from
the onsert because it described the transaction and what members were giving
up.  
<P>

851	According to Mrs Castle, the meeting had already started when Mr Morgan and
she arrived.  Mr Morgan introduced her and said
that he had asked her to review
Mr Heydon's opinion.  He said that she had also raised another s 52 issue as to
whether consumers
might be misled into thinking that road service in the future
would be free.  Mrs Castle said that she was concerned that people
may think
that because they were getting shares in the company free, road service and the
other advantages of membership would be
free, and Ms Conway said that the
prospectus made it clear that people had to pay for road service so she did not
see how that problem
could arise.  
<P>

852	After some brief comments on highlighting the future road service cost, and
still according to Mrs Castle, the conversation
went - 
<P>

"Mrs Castle:  
<P>

`Well, will we deal with the free shares question now?  I was asked late this
morning to review only that part of the Heydon opinion
which deals with the
question of free shares.  I have considered the opinion with reference to the
onsert and the first few pages
of the prospectus.  I have not seen the full
prospectus.  
<P>

Dyson Heydon is correct in saying that `free' as used in the NRMA documents is
capable of two meanings.  In one sense the shares
are not free since members
are giving up their right of membership in the Association and Insurance
companies.  In another sense
the shares are free as no money is being paid for
them.  There are, however, no trade practices cases on the meaning of the word
`free'.  Both views are open and the court could go either way but I think the
better view is that `free' should be interpreted to
mean `at no dollar cost to
the consumer'.  This is consistent with the decision in <i>Nelson v Concrete
Constructions</i> which says that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> should
be understood in a consumer context - indeed it is in the part of the act
entitled `Consumer Protection'.  This is the same
approach adopted by the Trade
Practices Commission which is concerned to ensure that consumers are not ripped
off.  For example in
the TPC's advertising guidelines there is an example of
`Buy one get one free' offers where the Commission is particularly concerned
about shop owners inflating the price of one product above its original price.
I think Dyson Heydon's other view on the meaning of
`free' is legally correct
but it is very technical as consumers simply wouldn't take into consideration
the kind of legal rights
he is referring to, and many of them in fact would not
even realise they had existing legal rights to give up.  However, Mr Heydon's
view, whilst conservative, is clearly tenable, and it would be open for a court
to find what Dyson Heydon has said."
<P>

853	There was then some discussion flowing from what Mrs Castle had said, which
she did not recall, and the conversation continued
-
<P>

	"Mrs Castle:  
<P>

`It really doesn't matter which is the better view.  The real issue is - what
are you going to do about Dyson Heydon's opinion?
 You couldn't expect that
Dyson Heydon would change his views, when we have no authorities to refer him
to.  I don't have any great
arguments to run with him.  Dyson Heydon suggests
that the word "free" should not be used at all.'
<P>

Advertising person:
<P>

"That's not possible.  "Free" is the basis of the whole advertising
campaign.'
<P>

Ms Conway:
<P>

`Fuck that.  Dyson will just have to be reasonable.  What he has said is
unacceptable.  He can't say that free is OK one day then
change his mind the
next.  The campaign has been signed off on by the Board sub-committee.'
<P>

Mrs Castle:
<P>

`The best that can be done is to try to negotiate with Dyson Heydon for an
appropriate qualification to the meaning of the term
`free' in order for him to
sign-off.  In the context of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a>, the representation has to be
considered at the time it is made and it is not sufficient for the misleading
impression to be corrected
in a later part or a separate document.  The
qualification would therefore have to be in large enough print to qualify the
word "free".
 It can't be so small that it just looks like an ant has crawled
across the page.'
<P>

Advertising person:
<P>

`Well we can't put a disclaimer each time the word "free" appears in the
prospectus.  The typesetting for the prospectus is virtually
complete - it
would be much easier if we only had to qualify the onsert.'
<P>

854	There was some general discussion about font size, colour and angle, and
where the disclaimer should go.  The conversation then
continued to the
following effect -
<P>

Mrs Castle:
<P>

`The purpose of the disclaimer is so members know that they are giving up their
rights.'
<P>

Ms Conway: 
<P>

`Yes, well we can probably live with something but where would it go?'
<P>

Mrs Castle:
<P>

`It would have to go on the onsert - probably in big font and on an angle like
the words "free shares" and also on the prospectus
as that is a separate
document.'
<P>

Ms Conway:
<P>

`Shit.  Dyson will just have to be realistic.  Let's get him on the line.'
<P>

855	Mrs Castle agreed that Mr Bateman said words passing on what Mr Heydon had
said in the telephone conversation early in the morning,
as recounted by Mr
Bateman, but said that they were not at the commencement of the meeting but
were after she had explained her views.
 She did not recall reference to Mr
Heydon having become a draftsman, and denied that Mr Morgan said that Mr Heydon
was wrong or
had no right to say what he said and that either Mr Morgan or she
said that under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> there were situations when you could
use "free" and it was correct to say that the shares were free.  
<P>

856	Mr Barrett recalled going through alternative forms of words, and Mr
Bateman having a telephone conversation with Mr Heydon.
 He did not recall
matters as Mrs Castle had recounted them, and denied that he, if the
"advertising person" referred to, had said
what she attributed to him.  Rather,
according to Mr Barrett, he said -
<P>

"We have used the word `free' through the onsert and throughout the prospectus.
If there is a legal problem with the use of the
word `free' in the onsert then
there will be the same problem in relation to the prospectus.  Accordingly we
will need to address
this problem not only in the onsert but also in the
prospectus.  Legal sign-off will be required for both documents."
<P>

Still according to Mr Barrett, Mr Morgan replied, "No, there is no problem in
the prospectus because `Free Shares' is a defined
term in the prospectus".  
<P>

857	At another point in his evidence Mr Barrett recalled that he said something
to Mr Morgan inquiring whether there were difficulties
with the use of the word
"free" to describe the shares, saying that the message had to be simple and
that members had to understand
they did not have to send any money in to obtain
the shares.  He said that Mr Morgan replied to the effect that it was
acceptable
to use the word "free" so long as it was explained in the prospectus
that the members were giving up their rights in Association
and Insurance in
return for the shares.  Some reformulations of the onsert were proposed, led by
Mr Barrett.  At one point Mr Barrett
said that he preferred that an asterisk
not be used, "Let's see if Heydon will accept a formulation which does not have
an asterisk.
 I could live with an asterisk if we have to have one." Mr Barrett
also said, "If you take away the existing membership, people will
want to know
what is being retained.  You have to give both the negative message and the
positive message."  
<P>

858	Mr Barrett accepted that the meeting had proceeded for about half an hour
before the telephone call to Mr Heydon, and also that
he had no real
recollection of what was said during that time.  He did have some recollection
of a possible problem that members
might think they were getting their road
service free of charge, and accepted that he said words to the effect that
"free" was the
basis of the whole advertising campaign.  He also accepted that
he said something to the effect that a disclaimer could not be put
in every
time the word "free" appeared in the prospectus, because the typesetting was
virtually complete and it would be much easier
if the only qualification was to
the onsert.  Having been taken through matters, Mr Barrett also accepted that
there was discussion
about qualifying words before the telephone call, and he
recalled Ms Conway saying something to the effect that Mr Heydon would have
to
be realistic and suggesting that he be telephoned.  
<P>

859	As I have already indicated, Ms Conway said that she first read Mr Heydon's
opinion of 2 August 1994 at the 2.00 pm meeting.
 According to Ms Conway, when
she got to the meeting someone said that there was an opinion from Mr Heydon
and she read at least
that part of it dealing with free shares.  Mr Morgan said
that Mr Heydon was wrong.  Ms Conway was surprised "because I knew from
the
communication meetings that this was a phrase that was being used in the
prospectus and I assumed that it had been signed-off
by everybody".  She said
at the meeting, "If Heydon has an objection to the use of the term `free
shares' on the onsert then this
will also have an impact on the use of that
term in the prospectus and we will need to address the drafting of the
prospectus as
well".  Mr Morgan immediately replied, "In my opinion Heydon's
advice does not affect the prospectus but only the onsert because
in the
prospectus the term `Free Shares' has been defined.  Accordingly we do not need
to change the prospectus".  He also said words
to the effect that Mr Heydon's
opinion was wrong.  
<P>

860	At another point in her evidence Ms Conway said that she recalled Mr Morgan
saying something the effect of which was that it
was acceptable to use the word
"free" as long as it was explained in the prospectus that members were giving
up their rights in Association
and Insurance in return for their shares.  Then
Mr Barrett said that there was no point in arguing about whether Mr Heydon was
wrong,
and started a discussion about how to deal with it.  Still according to
Ms Conway, Mrs Castle then talked about trade practices,
saying on the one hand
that Mr Heydon was technically correct and on the other hand that the shares
were free because no money was
being paid, and then the telephone call was made
to Mr Heydon.  
<P>

861	Ms Conway agreed that she was irritated and not entirely calm during the
meeting, although she denied the explicit language
attributed to her by others
and denied that before the telephone conversation with Mr Heydon there was some
discussion about a form
of qualification which might cure the problem
identified by Mr Heydon, a qualification of what "free shares" meant.  She
denied the
expanded account of the meeting given by Mrs Castle, saying that Mrs
Castle said very little during the meeting, and also denied
saying that Mr
Heydon was not asked the question or had no right to do what he had done.  She
pointed out that she was not on first
name terms with Mr Heydon, and had no
objection to his contribution to drafting.
<P>

862	Mrs Storrs summarised the meeting prior to the telephone call to Mr Heydon
as follows -
<P>

"Helen Conway and - Helen Conway basically stated that Heydon appeared to have
changed his advice about the use of the word `free'
and she was angry about
that and that we had to - we were meeting to solve the problem of what we were
going to do about the carriers,
bearing in mind the deadline we had with the
printers and the board.  John Morgan expressed concern and basically said that
he thought
Dyson Heydon's advice was not right and that he had brought Louise
Castle up, who was a trade practices lawyer at Allens, to give
her opinion to
the meeting.  The discussion got heated because basically it was considered
that we couldn't solve the problem.  I
mean, there was obviously a division of
opinions between what Dyson Heydon had said and what Allens considered to be
the correct
interpretation of the word `free'.  Greg Bateman was more concerned
- he was saying that its not so much the use of the word `free'
but the fact
that we had to qualify the use of the word `free'.  So I can't remember who
suggested to ring Dyson Heydon then and
there, whether it was Helen or Greg
himself, but Greg Bateman then got on the phone at the far end of the room and
spoke to Dyson
Heydon while we all sat there and listened to his end of the
conversation."
<P>

863	Mrs Storrs did recall that Mr Barrett "did not want to lose the use of the
word "free" as it would "water down the power of
the carrier as being something
that they'd open up and look at the proxy forms".  In saying that Ms Conway was
angry, she recalled
that she swore.  She later added that she remembered Mrs
Castle talking about the different uses of the word "free", "free in a
commercial
sense, meaning you don't pay any money, and free in the sense of
giving up rights as Dyson was now raising as an issue", and saying
that she
considered that in the circumstances it was acceptable to use the word "free"
in the commercial sense, that is, that members
did not have to pay any money
for the shares.  
<P>

864	Mrs Storrs recalled it being raised that there might be another problem
with the word "free" on the onsert, that members might
think they would get
their road service free of charge.  She recalled Mrs Castle saying that Mr
Heydon's view was technical, and
she recalled someone saying that it was no use
debating whether or not Mr Heydon could be prevailed on to change his mind and
the
problem had to be solved.  She recalled Ms Conway early in the meeting
saying something to the effect that Mr Heydon could not change
his mind
"because it will affect the entire set of documents that we have already put in
motion to get printed", and saying something
to the effect that Mr Heydon would
just have to be reasonable.  She also recalled Mr Barrett saying something to
the effect that
a disclaimer couldn't be put in every time the word free
appeared in the prospectus, because the typesetting for the prospectus was
virtually complete, and that it would be much easier if only the onsert had to
be changed.  Apart from supporting the accuracy of
her file note, Mrs Storrs
gave evidence that she recalled Mr Morgan saying, "It is lawful and appropriate
to use the word `free'
in the prospectus and on the onsert and Heydon is wrong
when he says that the shares are not free".
<P>

865	Mrs Storrs went some way to supporting Mrs Castle's account of this part of
the meeting, as where she was unable to recall she
did not deny that matters
might have been said as recounted by Mrs Castle.  Mrs Storrs did remember Mrs
Castle saying something to
the effect that both views were open and the court
could go either way and the better view was that "free" should be interpreted
to mean at no dollar cost to the consumer.  She also recalled discussion about
the possibility of changing the prospectus in relation
to the word "free", in
that Mr Barrett said that it would be a mammoth effort to change it, but her
recollection was "it was primarily
an issue of trying to solve the issue of the
onsert because it was seen that we could qualify it easily on the four bits of
paper
as opposed to the typed prospectus".  
<P>

866	Resolution of these differing recollections is not easy.  Many of the
differences do not matter, and in the following paragraphs
I will make findings
only so far as necessary or desirable for reaching my decision in these
proceedings.  To indicate detailing
of what was said in the meeting would be
unrealistic.  In making my findings I obtain assistance from an earlier
statement and voicemail
record prepared by Mrs Castle without setting out the
process of comparison.
<P>

867	It would have been natural for Mr Bateman to tell those present of his
early morning conversation with Mr Heydon in which qualification
of "free
shares", as an alternative to doing away with the phrase, was raised, and that
was probably done early in the meeting. 
Comments on Mr Heydon's role are not
of much significance, but I accept that Mr Morgan said that he thought Mr
Heydon was wrong,
and that Mrs Castle said that there were two available views
and that Mr Heydon's view was a technical one but she thought the better
view
was that "free" meant at no dollar cost.
<P>

868	It remained, however, that senior counsel eminent in the field had advised
that describing the shares to be issued by Holdings
as free shares was
ambiguous or worse, and that was seen at the meeting as providing potential for
misleading conduct contrary to
s 52 of the TP Act.  As would also have been
natural, someone - whether it was Mrs Castle, Mr Barrett, Ms Conway, or
someone else
is immaterial - raised whether his advice affected the use of
the description in the prospectus.  I accept that Mr Morgan responded
to the
effect that it did not, and Mr Bateman did not say anything to the contrary.

<P>

869	If Mr Morgan gave as his reasoning that "Free Shares" was defined in the
prospectus, he was in error, because tracing through
the definition did not
remove the vice seen by Mr Heydon.  It is not easy to see how he could have so
reasoned given his familiarity
with the prospectus.  On the other hand, a
number of witnesses recalled him relying on the definition, including on
earlier and later
occasions than this meeting.  The probable explanation is
that Mr Morgan believed that it was made clear in the prospectus that the
shares were being issued in return for giving up membership rights, and his
references to the description of this were taken by some
of those he addressed
to be references to definitions.  I accept the substance of Mr Morgan's
evidence that the expressed reason
for his response was to the effect that the
prospectus described the transaction and what members were giving up.
<P>

870	The attention thus focussed on the onsert, and abandonment of the phrase
"free shares" being unacceptable for marketing reasons,
led to consideration of
a qualification which would be acceptable to Mr Heydon.  It was made plain that
significant change to the
prospectus was logistically unacceptable, but  I do
not accept that Mrs Castle spoke in favour of a qualification on the prospectus
as well as the onsert, as that would have been inconsistent with Mr Morgan's
expressed view that Mr Heydon's advice did not affect
the use of the
description in the prospectus.  Mr Barrett preferred to avoid an asterisk.
There was discussion and arrival at a qualification.
 Ms Conway was not happy
with the turn of events, and to move things along said that Mr Heydon should be
telephoned to see whether
he considered it acceptable.
<P>

(d)  <u>The telephone call to Mr Heydon</u>
<P>

871	The telephone call was made by Mr Bateman.  The participation of those at
the meeting in Mr Bateman's end of the conversation,
what was said to and by Mr
Heydon, whether Mr Morgan was present for the whole conversation, and even
whether Ms Conway took over
the telephone from Mr Bateman, were in dispute.
<P>

872	Mr Bateman did not recall whether a conference telephone was used or
whether he reported Mr Heydon's comments to the meeting,
but his evidence was
that all present were silent while he was speaking to Mr Heydon.  According to
Mr Bateman, the conversation
went -
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"I'm in a meeting down here at the NRMA with Helen Conway, John Morgan and
others.  We've got your opinion on the onsert.  Thank
you for the suggested
wording change for the front cover of the onsert.
<P>

Have you got the onsert handy?"
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

"Yes, I've got that in front of me."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"Now, you told me this morning that there might be other ways of addressing the
problem of the wording on the front.  We've talked
about it down here.  The
NRMA would prefer to retain `Free Shares' on the front.  You said that would be
OK, if where it first appeared,
it was qualified and the reader was told that
the member was giving up his rights."
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

"Yes.  If you want to use "Free Shares" then, where it first appears, the
member should be told that he is giving up his rights
as a member."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"That's fine.  Now, the proposal is that "Free Shares" and the other wording on
the front is retained but insert the qualification
that it's in return for
membership.  At the same time we want to assert the positive side that Road
Service and insurance policies
continue as usual."
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

"My concern is only where `free" first appears.  It should be qualified there.
Once you've told members about it, then it does not
have to be qualified
again."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

The other issue you raised was the choice between shares and cash.  We felt
that this was made pretty clear in the "Acceptance of
Free Shares" part which
is inside, plus on the instructions part."
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

"Yes, I see that."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"In any event I think the proposed wording will address any residual concern
you might have on the cash aspect as well."
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

	"What's your proposed wording?"
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"The existing large lettering on the front stays as is.  Then underneath that
goes:  
<P>

	`The Free Shares (or cash alternative) are in return for your existing
membership.  Road service and policies continue as usual.'
<P>

This goes on the front cover, two lines above the words `If undeliverable
return to etc" and is printed on the horizontal."
<P>

(Mr Heydon appeared to write down the wording, and read it back;  Mr Bateman
confirmed it.)
<P>

Mr Heydon then said:
<P>

"Yes, that seems fine.  That answers the problem.  I'm sure there are other
ways of answering the problem.  That suggestion seems
fine."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"If you're happy with that then we would like you to revise your written
opinion so that it addresses this new wording.  I'll get
a redraft of the
onsert to you this afternoon.  Could we have your revised opinion by midday
tomorrow?"
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

"Yes."
<P>

873	Mr Bateman said that he did not think Ms Conway took the telephone and
spoke to Mr Heydon, and in general did not agree with
the account given by Mrs
Castle to which I will shortly come.  
<P>

874	Mr Heydon's recollection was of a less extensive telephone conversation.
He was in conference on another matter, and he would
not normally have engaged
in such a long telephone conversation as an interruption to a conference.  His
recollection of the conversation
was -
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"I am ringing about your opinion on the onsert.  I have received it.  Thank you
for your suggested wording change for the front
cover of the onsert.  I want to
ask you about another possible way of overcoming the problem about "free
shares" on the front of
the onsert.  It involves keeping the words "free
shares" and the other wording on the front, but putting the following wording
near
"free shares" on the front - "The Free Shares(or cash alternative) are in
return for your existing membership.  Road Service and
policies continue as
usual."  Would that overcome the problem you set out in the opinion?"  
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

"Could you dictate that for me slowly so that I can take it down?"
<P>

(The wording was dictated, and may have been read back and confirmed)
<P>

Mr Heydon:
<P>

	"I'll consider it."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"I'll send you a letter confirming that wording today.  If it is satisfactory
could you amend your opinion to incorporate a view
on the extra wording.  As
you know, we need it tomorrow."
<P>

875	Mr Heydon did not recall reference to a meeting at the NRMA, to earlier
approval of qualification when the words "free shares"
first appeared, or to
the reader being told that the member was giving up his rights.  Nor did he
remember saying that his concern
was only where "free" first appeared, and that
it should be qualified there and need not be qualified again.  According to Mr
Heydon,
he did not approve the form of words suggested by Mr Bateman over the
telephone, and said that he would consider it, but he accepted
that he may have
said that he saw no problem with the form of words.  
<P>

876	It was Mr Morgan's recollection that Mr Bateman telephoned Mr Heydon,
although he accepted the possibility that it was Ms Conway.
 At one point he
said that he did not hear the conversation because he left the meeting at that
time, but he also said that he left
the meeting "at the end of the conversation
or before it actually concluded".  Mr Morgan said that when he left the meeting
he had
the impression that some sort of qualification was acceptable to Mr
Heydon, so he must have been present for a reasonable part of
the conversation,
a part during which something of substance was said.  That Mr Morgan left at
least before the end of the telephone
conversation is supported by Mrs Castle's
evidence that she left a voice mail for him afterwards telling him the result
of the phone
call:  there is no particular reason to disbelieve this.  Probably
Mr Morgan was at the meeting for a good deal of the conversation
but not until
its end.  Whatever the position, he did not provide evidence of what he heard
as Mr Bateman's end of the conversation.
<P>

877	According to Mrs Castle, when Ms Conway suggested that Mr Heydon be
telephoned Mr Bateman made the call from a telephone at
the far end of the
meeting room.  She heard Mr Bateman say that he was in a meeting at the NRMA
discussing the opinion, and that
there were "some ideas which we would like to
put to you about a disclaimer".  After something said by Mr Heydon, Mr Bateman
said,
"No, they want to try and keep the word `free' and build something around
that".  Ms Conway said to Mr Bateman, "Put the disclaimer
to him", and Mr
Bateman said to Mr Heydon, "What do you think about `this is in exchange for
your existing membership?"  After a
pause, Ms Conway took the telephone and
said, "Hello Dyson.  It's Helen Conway.  We need to get a sign-off on free
shares today as
the whole thing is tipped to go to the printers".  There was
another pause, and Ms Conway told the meeting that Mr Heydon "wants
a form of
qualification used every time the word `free' appears".  
<P>

878	Still according to Mrs Castle, the advertising person shook his head and
said, "It is not possible to alter the layout of the
prospectus as there is not
enough time and the most that can be done is to fiddle with the onsert", and Ms
Conway then said into
the telephone, "The term `free' cannot really be
qualified each time it is used in the prospectus.  The onsert is the main thing
which consumers will be focussing on so it should be enough if it is
qualified."  There was then a conversation at the meeting in
which Mrs Castle
said, "You will have to offer to qualify the front page of the prospectus.
Dyson will insist as it's a separate
document".  Ms Conway said, "He wants to
use `this is in extinguishment of existing membership rights'."  The
advertising person
said "We can't use extinguishment.  That's too legal.", and
Mrs Castle said, "This is in exchange for your existing membership?".
 Ms
Conway then said into the telephone, "Dyson, what about `this is in exchange
for your existing membership'?"  
<P>

879	In one of her witness statements Mrs Castle said that while the
conversation was being conducted other people present at the
meeting continued
their own conversations in groups of two or three, although those conversations
stopped from time to time.
<P>

880	Mrs Castle's evidence did not include an end to the telephone conversation.
She accepted that it was possible that Ms Conway
had not taken up the telephone
conversation, saying that that was "not my best recollection", which casts
doubt on her recollection
if such a basic matter be unclear.  She also accepted
that Ms Conway may have said things in discussion prior to the telephone call
which she (Mrs Castle) now attributed to the telephone conversation.  This
would, of course, require that Mrs Castle's recollection
had moulded what was
said in prior discussion to the terms of a conversation with Mr Heydon, but the
capacity of the human mind to
self-deception would extend to that. 
<P>

881	According to Mr Barrett, Ms Conway asked Mr Bateman to telephone Mr Heydon,
and Mr Bateman did so with those present at the
meeting listening to his end of
the conversation.  Mr Barrett could not recall what he heard.  He thought that
the telephone conversation
took about ten minutes, but his recollection of 2
August 1994 was vague;  he also said that after the telephone call concluded he
"proposed some wordings and sought some consensus", and there was discussion.
Mr Barrett had no recollection of Ms Conway taking
the telephone, but did not
dispute that it may have happened.  He also recalled someone saying words to
the effect that the term
"free" cannot really be qualified each time it is used
in the prospectus, and that the onsert was the main thing which consumers
would
be focussing on so it should be enough if it were qualified, and he also
recalled that he said that the word "extinguishment"
could not be used because
it was too legal and that someone then suggested the phrase "This is in
exchange for your existing membership".
 It is not clear that these
recollections were related to the telephone conversation with Mr Heydon rather
than preceding or subsequent
events at the meeting.
<P>

882	Ms Conway recalled that Mr Bateman telephoned Mr Heydon, and denied that
she joined in the conversation.  She said that she
did not overhear much of the
conversation, and that it was short and there was "still a deal of activity in
the room" while Mr Bateman
was speaking to Mr Heydon.  According to Ms Conway,
when Mr Bateman finished the telephone call he "indicated the substance of the
conversation with Dyson Heydon and by that I mean he talked about a
qualification and there was discussion around the room about
that."  However,
she said that she agreed to the proposal that Mr Heydon should be asked to give
a fresh opinion based on the new
version of the onsert, because she thought
that the onsert as it had been amended following the discussion with Mr Heydon
and others
on 2 August 1994 was a different document from that which had been
the subject of his opinion.
<P>

883	 Mrs Storrs said that Ms Conway did not speak to Mr Heydon.  Her evidence
was that Mr Morgan was present while Mr Bateman spoke
to Mr Heydon, that those
present sat quietly listening to Mr Bateman as he spoke, and that Mr Bateman
did not seek or receive views
of others at the meeting while he spoke.  She
said that the conversation was not a short one, and "was basically putting up
the words
of the rider that everyone had decided on within the meeting to him
and asking him whether or not that would be appropriate to solve
the problem".

<P>

884	Mr Heydon denied that Ms Conway spoke to him during the telephone
conversation.  He denied that he was told about the need for
a sign-off on free
shares that day, or anything about qualification of the term "free" each time
it was used in the prospectus or
the sufficiency of qualification in the
onsert:  he said that nothing was said to him about the prospectus.  He denied
saying anything
about using "This is in extinguishment of existing membership
rights".  His reasons for his denials included that he had never been
provided
with the whole prospectus in draft or final form;  that he had never been asked
for his opinion about the use of the expression
`free shares' in the prospectus
as distinct from the first page of the onsert;  that in the briefs which did
provide him with parts
of the prospectus in draft there was reference to the
Members Free Offer but not to `free shares'; and that he had no recollection
even as to the Perpetual brief of noticing the use of the expression `free
shares'.
<P>

885	In these recollections of the telephone call to Mr Heydon, Mrs Castle is
rather at odds with the participants and other observers.
 Her earlier
statement and voicemail record were broadly consistent with her evidence, but
were not created in circumstances commanding
reliability.  The file notes are
against acceptance of her evidence, both as to Mr Bateman's participation and
as to the presentation
to Mr Heydon of a suggested qualification rather than a
process of negotiation, and a process of negotiation is unlikely.  Further,
it
is unlikely given his earlier conversation with Mr Bateman that Mr Heydon would
have said that there should be the rather unrealistic
course of a qualification
every time the word "free" appeared.  I do not accept Mrs Castle's evidence to
do with the telephone call,
and in particular do not think that she suggested
that the front page of the prospectus be qualified or that Ms Conway (or Mr
Bateman)
spoke to Mr Heydon about a qualification in the prospectus.  
<P>

886	There is again difficulty in resolving the differing recollections, at
least in attempting precision in the finding.  Without
commitment to the
precise words, in my view the probability is that the conversation was to the
effect recalled by Mr Bateman, with
no real input from others at the meeting
because a form of qualification had already been discussed and was being put to
Mr Heydon.
<P>

887	I have not overlooked other recollections of the afternoon meeting.  Ms
Scroope had only a general recollection of the meeting,
but she did recall Mrs
Castle saying something to the effect that "free" was capable of two meanings,
and that Mr Heydon's view was
legally correct but very technical and a court
might find the way he had advised.  She recalled discussion about a disclaimer
so
members knew they were giving up their rights, and Mr Bateman making a
telephone call and relaying comments back (as she understood
it) from Mr
Heydon.  She had no recollection of Ms Conway speaking on the telephone to Mr
Heydon, although she acknowledged that
she might have, and did recall some
discussion at the meeting about a proposed form of words being too legal.  Mr
Mamutil had no
significant recollection of the meeting of 2 August 1994, save
that he remembered Mr Bateman speaking on the telephone to Mr Heydon
and from
time to time relaying what Mr Heydon was saying back to the others at the
meeting.  He was certain that Ms Conway did not
speak to Mr Heydon.  At one
point in his evidence Mr Mamutil said that there was discussion around the room
during the telephone
conversation;  at another point he said that those at the
meeting listened quietly.  His recollection did not go beyond that the
meeting
was about the onsert and the wording on the onsert, and to do with free shares.
Mr Mamutil did not really recall Mrs Castle
being at the meeting.  There was
more;  my conclusions remain the same.
<P>

<b>Mr Heydon's opinion of 3 August 1994</b> 
<P>

888	Ms Scroope could readily produce amended versions of the onsert, and a
version of the onsert was printed out with the addition
on the first page,
towards the bottom and below "How many FREE shares you will get!", of the
words, "The Free Shares (or cash alternative)
are in return for your existing
membership.  Road Service and policies continue as usual".  
<P>

889	Mr Bateman sent a letter dated 2 August 1994 to Mr Heydon
reading -
<P>

"We refer to our letter of 28 July and your written opinion dated today, for
which we thank you.
<P>

As discussed on the telephone this afternoon, the wording on the front of the
onsert has been amended to make it clear the extent
to which the shares are in
fact `free'.
<P>

You will note that wording is:
<P>

`The Free Shares (or cash equivalent) are in return for your existing
membership. Road Service and policies continue as usual'.
<P>

We believe that this meets the matters raised on pages 4 and 5 of your
opinion.
<P>

As a matter of form, we <u>enclose</u>:
<P>

(a)	a letter dated today in identical terms to that of 28 July 1994;
<P>

(b)	the complete onsert, with its additional wording.
<P>

In the circumstances we would be pleased if you would re-cast your opinion so
that it is directed to the enclosed document, rather
than the one previously
supplied. In other words, the written opinion should not refer to our
28 July letter, the previous onsert
nor your previous opinion. The opinion
now sought will be `stand alone'.
<P>

We trust that this will result in your confirmation that there are no legal
issues arising from having on the first page `How to
vote!' in combination with
`How may FREE shares will you get!'
<P>

We look forward to receipt of your written opinion as soon as possible."
<P>

890	The enclosures were as stated, the onsert being the reprinted version with
the additional wording on the first page.  A copy
of the letter was sent to Ms
Conway.  
<P>

891	Why did Mr Bateman ask for a stand-alone opinion?  On both their accounts
of the telephone conversation between Mr Bateman and
Mr Heydon, Mr Bateman
asked for a revised or amended opinion.  It may be reading too much into this
to infer that Mr Bateman had
in mind a stand-alone opinion rather than a
supplementary opinion, even without reference to Ms Conway.  
<P>

892	According to Ms Conway, at the end of the meeting there was talk of
obtaining a second opinion from Mr Heydon.  She thought
that the suggestion
came from Mr Bateman, and that the purpose was to give Mr Heydon a new onsert
with the qualification in it and
get his advice on it, because it was Mr
Bateman's understanding that that would be acceptable to Mr Heydon.  The
opinion was to be
a stand-alone opinion because the relevant document was a new
document.  It was suggested to Mr Bateman that he had wanted a stand-alone
opinion so that it could be provided to the boards without disclosure that Mr
Heydon had raised the free shares problem, and that
he was reluctant to
disclose the free shares problem because it would reflect on him and would
provide ammunition for those opposed
to the proposal.  
<P>

893	Mr Bateman denied this, and I do not accept the suggested motivation.  It
would have been unrealistic to expect Mr Heydon's
concern over free shares
would not become known, or that the stand-alone opinion would not refer to it
even if expressing satisfaction
that the revised onsert was acceptable.  As
will appear, the free shares problem was not hidden, but was made known to the
boards.
 It was understandable to ask for an opinion addressing the revised
onsert, in that sense a stand-alone opinion, and I do not think
there was
anything more to it than that.
<P>

894	Mr Heydon provided an opinion dated 3 August 1994 in response to
the letter of 2 August 1994.  
<P>

895	The introduction and the opinion so far as it related to the first question
were unchanged from the opinion of 2 August 1994.
 
<P>

896	The answer to the second question read -
<P>

"While I do not think this will necessarily be held to be an attempt to induce
members to vote `yes', it may be. But as indicated
in answer to question 1, any
tendency of the proposed words to operate as an inducement to vote `yes' would
not operate to any greater
extent than the inherent tendency of the proposal;
and the form makes it plain at two points that while it is possible to vote
`no',
it is desirable for a person voting no to choose between shares and cash,
since a 75% majority may vote `yes'.
<P>

There are two aspects of the words which require reconsideration.
<P>

The first aspect concerns their role as an indication of what the member must
do; the second concerns the meaning of the word `FREE'.
<P>

The essential activities to which the onsert is directed are 
<P>

(a)	voting on the proposals;
<P>

(b)	choice between shares and cash in the event that 75% of the votes are
affirmative.
<P>

The present words by themselves do not indicate accurately that the member must
choose between shares and cash. However, it is proposed
to place below them,
though in much smaller type, the words:
<P>

`The Free Shares (or cash alternative) are in return for your existing
membership. Road Service and policies continue as usual.'
<P>

Those words (subject to two changes discussed below), when read with the words
at the top of the page `Important Information Inside',
in the light of the
obvious fact that the actual instructions are inside, are sufficient to point
the reader towards the place where
full information on what the member must do
will be found.
<P>

There is an important sense in which the shares are not `free':  they are not
free because the members are giving up rights (admittedly
of a somewhat
intangible character) and Holdings is gaining greater power in the Association
and NRMA Insurance. Indeed if the shares
were free the entire transaction would
be at risk, because the shares will have a par value, and perhaps a premium;
under the general
law to issue the shares free would be to issue them at a
discount, which is unlawful. Hence in one somewhat technical sense the shares
are not free, though in a more popular sense they are free because no money
need be paid for them. In my opinion the ambiguity in
the word `FREE' appearing
in the statement `How many FREE shares will you get!', considered by itself, is
cured by the additional
words appearing below it. They highlight that something
must be given up to get the shares even though it is not money, namely
membership
(but not the benefits of Road Service and insurance policies). They
also afford a more complete disclosure of the fact, which may
be critical to
some readers, that if the proposals enjoy enough support, members can obtain an
immediate cash payment in lieu of
shares.
<P>

In my opinion, as foreshadowed above, it would be prudent to make two changes,
however. One is to place an asterisk after `FREE'
and a corresponding asterisk
at the start of the text in smaller type below it. The other is to make that
text which is in smaller
type into significantly larger type. Accepting that
there are physical and perhaps aesthetic limits to what can be done, it must
be
remembered that the larger the type, the less likely it is to be overlooked,
the less risk there is of readers being led into
a misapprehension and the less
risk there is of successful challenge to the document.
<P>

Again, then, while legal issues arise from the form of the first page, in my
opinion they will be resolved favourably if the two
changes mentioned are
made."
<P>

897	It will be seen that, as might have been expected, Mr Heydon identified his
concern over free shares, but went on to express
satisfaction that the revised
onsert was acceptable.  He did not say that no legal issues arose.  Rather, he
said that legal issues
arose, one obviously being the free shares problem, but
that he thought they would be "resolved favourably".  The NRMA said that
this
left a material issue for the purposes of the due diligence process, a matter
to which I will return.  
<P>

898	In its submissions the NRMA was critical of Mr Heydon for providing a
second stand-alone opinion, although without directly
asserting an unacceptable
motivation as had been asserted against Mr Bateman, and it said that this and
his abandonment of the phrase
"ambiguity or worse" was "inexplicable".  The
criticism in both respects should be soundly rejected - I see nothing
inexplicable
or untoward in what Mr Heydon did.
<P>

899	Mr Morgan recalled being told by Ms Conway that Mr Heydon had agreed to
"free shares" as long as it was qualified, and that
he was revising his opinion
and a copy would be sent to him.  He also said that at a meeting on 3 August
1994 he was told, probably
by Ms Conway, but perhaps by someone else, that the
problem raised by Mr Heydon had been resolved "but we will have to put an
asterisk
against the word `free' where it is first used, with a note that
members are giving up their membership.  He will be issuing a new
opinion which
will be faxed through later in the day".
<P>

900	A copy of the opinion of 3 August 1994 was faxed by Mr Bateman to Mr
Mamutil at 12.30 pm on that day. Mr Mamutil passed it on
to Ms Conway with a
note, "Arrangements are currently being made to arrange an onserts meeting
regarding the Heydon advise [sic]
attached.  They have requested a * insert to
`Free' and additional words to be enlarged".  A copy of the opinion was faxed
to Mr
Morgan by the NRMA at about the same time.  
<P>

901	Mr Morgan said that he considered from both opinions that Mr Heydon was
saying that use of the expression "free shares" was
justified as long as it was
made clear to members that they were giving up their membership rights in
return for shares.  He said
that he considered that this was made clear by the
then current draft of the prospectus, especially the material describing the
legal
steps involved in the change.  Mr Simpson's understanding was that the
problem was resolved by qualifying the words "free shares"
when first used to
make it clear that the shares were received in exchange for membership, and
that the resolution was satisfactory
to Mr Morgan.  Mr Simpson thought that Mr
Heydon was overly cautious, and in some external communications after early
August 1994
did not insist on a similar qualification because he thought it
would lead to confusion.  
<P>

902	I said earlier that there was some attention in these proceedings to how Mr
Heydon's opinion of 2 August 1994 should be read.
 The defendants, or at least
AT, said that Mr Heydon was not raising a problem of misleading conduct, but a
corporations law problem
to do with the prohibition on the issue of shares for
no consideration.  Focussing on what Mr Heydon said about the entire
transaction
being at risk, in the course of evidence and to a lesser extent in
submissions AT's stance was to the effect that Mr Heydon was advising
that the
greater power gained by Holdings from members giving up their collective rights
was good consideration for the issue of
the shares by Holdings, and so the
entire transaction was not at risk through contravention of the prohibition.
Mr Bateman gave evidence
that he considered that Mr Heydon was not talking
about "free" being misleading, but about the corporations law problem if the
shares
were free because they would be issued for no consideration, and so that
he did not see the free shares problem as having any impact
on the prospectus.
Indeed, Mr Bateman said that he thought that the shares were free to a member
even if membership rights were being
given up, because from the viewpoint of
the individual member the membership rights were of little value.
Collectively, looked at
from the viewpoint of Holdings, the membership rights
were of value, and so there could be consideration for the issue of the
shares.
<P>

903	The AT stance flowed from the evidence of Mr Bateman, but if Mr Bateman did
understand Mr Heydon's opinion in the manner he
described (and his evidence was
not entirely uniform on the point) I consider that he was in error.  Mr Heydon
had intended to raise
a problem of misleading conduct, and that is the way the
problem was seen at the meeting on the afternoon of 2 August 1994 and
thereafter.
 The opinion of 2 August 1994 on an ordinary reading refers to
ambiguity of "free" and to it being wrong to describe the shares as
free.
Whether the shares in Holdings were issued for no consideration depended on the
facts, not on the description of the shares,
and Mr Heydon's reference to the
entire transaction being at risk if the shares were free was really an aside
that, had the shares
truly been free, which they were not, they would be issued
for no consideration and the transaction would for that reason be at risk.
<P>

904	I have difficulty in accepting that Mr Bateman did not recognise that the
free shares problem raised by Mr Heydon was a problem
of misleading conduct, or
misleading information for members, and at times in his evidence he agreed that
one of the things Mr Heydon
was saying, although a subsidiary matter, was that
members should be told that they were giving up their membership in order to
avoid
the misapprehension that they were not giving up anything.  His
explanations of what he understood from Mr Heydon's opinions were
not easy to
follow, and if he had the understanding put forward in his evidence he did not
adequately convey it to those with whom
he was dealing in August 1994.  
<P>

905	Nonetheless Mr Bateman also thought that use of the expression "free
shares" was justified if it was made clear to members that
they were giving up
their membership rights.  He may have thought that it was unnecessary to make
it clear, because he thought shares
were free to a member even if membership
rights were being given up, or he may have thought that it was desirable to
make it clear
in connection with a perceived corporations law problem.  But he
addressed the free shares problem raised by Mr Heydon, and I accept
that he
also thought it was made clear by the then current draft of the prospectus that
members were giving up their membership rights
in return for shares.
<P>

<b>More changes to the onsert</b>
<P>

906	Ms Conway, Mr Barrett, and Mr Bateman met at 3.50 pm on 3 August
1994, and it was decided to place an asterisk after "FREE"
in the words on the
first page of the onsert "How many FREE shares you will get!", with the
corresponding asterisk directing attention
to the newly added words, and to
move those words to the margin of the first page and enlarge the print.  
<P>

907	Mr Bateman's evidence was that Ms Conway said that they had considered Mr
Heydon's opinion and proposed to put the asterisk
after the word "FREE" and the
explanatory words in the margin;  Mr Bateman asked why they wanted to put the
explanatory words in
the margin;  Mr Barrett said because it gave an
uncluttered message;  Mr Bateman observed that the margin was shaded blue and
if
the words were put there they may not sufficiently have attention drawn to
them;  Mr Barrett said that the blue was not very dark
and the text size would
be increased so it would stand out;  Ms Conway said, "It fits in with what
Dyson Heydon was saying";  and
Mr Bateman said that it seemed okay, it did fit
in with what Mr Heydon was saying.  Ms Conway had no recollection of this
meeting,
and it is perhaps difficult to fit in with her later insistence on
removing "free" from the first page of the onsert.  I nonetheless
accept that
something to the effect recounted by Mr Bateman occurred - it is the
explanation for the changes to the onsert in fact
made.  Probably Ms Conway's
thinking was changing, and the reiteration of Ms Singleton's query on 4 August
1994 (see below) later
led her to a more cautious approach which she thought
more fully met the problem raised by Mr Heydon.
<P>

908	The due diligence committee met at 4.00 pm on 3 August 1994.  Those present
included Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman.  The minutes
recorded discussion of the
prospectus, but did not record any reference to the onsert or a free shares
problem.  Mr Morgan's best
memory was that it was not referred to.
<P>

909	The prospectus working group met at 7.00 pm on 3 August 1994, and spent
three hours going through the prospectus.  The evidence
did not suggest that a
free shares problem was raised.
<P>

910	The board of Holdings met at 10.00 am on 4 August 1994, those in attendance
including Ms Conway and Mr Bateman, and amongst
other things discussed the
prospectus.  So far as the minutes showed there was no reference to a free
shares problem.  Mr Bateman's
notes of the meeting included, however, under a
heading referring to Section I of the prospectus, "Jane concern re Recom [?]
implies
you must vote `yes' to get the share".  
<P>

911	The boards of Association and Insurance met jointly at 11.00 am on 4 August
1994, those in attendance again including Ms Conway
and Mr Bateman.  The
minutes recorded "Section 1 of the prospectus as amended was tabled and noted",
but again so far as the minutes
showed there was no reference to a free shares
problem.  Mr Bateman's notes of the joint meeting included "Jane concerned re
vote
`yes' is req to get Free Shares".  Ms Singleton was present at the
meeting, and said that she was concerned that voting yes was a
requirement to
get the free shares.  Ms Conway replied, "We are getting an opinion on that.
We will be able to give it to you at
the next meeting".  
<P>

912	Mr Heydon had been briefed to advise concerning Ms Singleton's query.
According to Ms Conway, she thought it inappropriate to
table either of Mr
Heydon's opinions at the meetings, because Mr Barrett and Mr Simon Fitch (of
Saatchi and Saatchi ("S&amp;S"),
an advertising agency working on the proposal)
were still not entirely happy with the layout and wording of the onsert, and
she anticipated
that there might be further developments in the next couple of
days.  Still according to Ms Conway, she anticipated that an opinion
would be
obtained from AT on the final form of the onsert.  A suggestion of keeping the
free shares problem from the boards, similar
to that earlier mentioned, was
made, but again I reject it.  There were  indeed further developments in the
next couple of days,
and it made sense to wait until the final position was
known.  The problem was not hidden, an opinion was obtained from AT on the
final form of the onsert, and it was provided to Ms Singleton and the boards.

<P>

913	A further print of the onsert as at 4 August 1994 was produced, with the
asterisk and relocation as decided on 3 August 1994.
 A copy in evidence had
notations by Mr Mamutil indicating deletion of the asterisk and the addition,
below "How many FREE shares
you will get!", of "Why the shares are FREE!" with
an arrow pointing to the margin;  the marginal words were crossed out and "new
words" was noted.  When the notations were made was unclear, but even on 4
August 1994 there must have been reconsideration of how
to meet the free shares
problem with the onsert.  Via another NRMA employee, on 4 August 1994 Mrs
Storrs told Ms Parker that the
"cover wording needs to be changed", and the
communications meeting on 4 August 1994 was told by Ms Parker that the wording
was "still
being worked on".  The force for reconsideration seems to have been
the marketing and public relations advisers.  This appears not
just from Ms
Conway's evidence and Ms Parker's involvement, but from the fact that on 4
August 1994 a meeting was arranged for 5
August 1994 to be attended by those
advisers and Mr Bateman.
<P>

914	Early on 5 August 1994 Mrs Storrs had a meeting with Ms Conway and
Mr Morgan.  Her file note read, "Advised problems with the
carrier form
due to the wording `free'.  ... Lisa Storrs to liaise with Greg Bateman on the
wording of carrier so as to avoid the
use of the word `free' on the front of
the page."  
<P>

915	Mrs Storrs could not add much to the file note, but said that Ms Conway was
referring to the front page of the onsert.  The
file note is rather obscure.
Ms Conway already knew of Mr Heydon's opinions, and the best reading is that Ms
Conway told Mrs Storrs
her view of the problems it generated and instructed her
that the use of the word "free" was to be avoided on the first page of the
onsert.  One inference is that the problems were simply that, on consideration,
Ms Conway thought that any use of the word "free",
even qualified in some way,
was unacceptable.  Another inference is that the problems were that using
"free" without the asterisk
and marginal note was unacceptable to Mr Heydon
but, from what she had been told of the unhappiness of Mr Barrett and Mr Fitch,
having
an asterisk referring to a note was unacceptable to the marketing and
public relations advisers, so Ms Conway came to the view that
the word "free"
should not be used at all.   
<P>

916	The former inference is supported by the evidence of Ms Conway to which I
will shortly refer.  The latter inference is supported
by what occurred at the
10.30 am meeting next mentioned.  Mr Morgan shed no light on the matter.
<P>

917	At 10.30 am on 5 August 1994 there was a meeting attended by Mrs Storrs, Mr
Robert Farmer and Mr Ron Payne (senior managers
in the NRMA in the public
relations area), Ms Scroope, Mr Bateman, and Mr Fitch.  There was dissent
from changing the onsert so as
to avoid the use of the word "free" on the first
page.  Mrs Storrs' file note read -
<P>

"Discussion as to the rewording of the carrier. Agreed that the use of the word
`free' was the most effective for getting members
to open up the package. It
was agreed that the use of the words `How many shares you will be given' was
acceptable but not as effective.
The following wording was agreed as appearing
as the rider.
<P>

The Free Shares (or cash alternative) are in exchange for membership under the
Articles of each of NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance
Limited. Whether you accept
the Free Shares or the cash alternative, road service and policies continue as
usual. Greg Bateman was
of the opinion that we would not attempt to put the
rider in the paragraphs on the inside of the carrier as this would
`cannibalise'
the entire instruction sheet. Instead it was suggested that we
retain the use of the word free on the front of the carrier, not put
an
asterisk but instead have the words `why these shares are free' in 9.5 point
with an arrow pointing to the margin and the qualifying
paragraph placed in 9.5
point type."
<P>

Mr Bateman's file note of the meeting was consistent with this, in particular
recording the same wording for the rider, and included
a rough layout of the
first page of the onsert reflecting the outcome. 
<P>

918	According to Mr Bateman, Mr Fitch said that when people saw an asterisk it
meant to beware, and "we have to present this in
a way that doesn't frighten
them".  Some formulations of words for the first page of the onsert were
discussed, and Mr Fitch said
that the page was now getting very cluttered and
suggested putting something like "Why are the shares Free!" with an arrow
pointing
to the left hand margin where the reader could see why the shares were
free.  Mr Bateman commented that the arrow would have to be
significant enough
to draw the reader's attention to the text in the margin.  There was discussion
of size and shape and the wording
of the text for the margin, and ultimately Mr
Bateman said that it seemed okay, "It still meets the concerns that Dyson
Heydon expressed".
 Mrs Storrs agreed with Mr Bateman's evidence in this
respect.  
<P>

919	Mr Bateman denied that he used the word "cannibalise", while Mrs Storrs
said that she distinctly remembered him using it, but
I do not think it
matters, and Ms Scroope's imperfect recollection of the meeting included Mr
Fitch expressing concern about an asterisk
frightening people and a different
form of words being suggested not using the word "free".  Mr Fitch had only a
vague recollection
of what could have been this occasion, so far as it went
consistent with Mr Bateman's account.  Mr Mamutil's notations earlier mentioned
may have been made when he was told of what the meeting had decided.
<P>

920	Mrs Storrs told Ms Conway what the meeting had decided Ms Conway said
that she did not want the word "free" used on the cover
of the onsert any
longer.  That and what followed was recorded in Mrs Storrs' file note -
<P>

"Advised results of the meeting, she said she was not happy because it involved
the use of the word `free' and even if Greg Bateman
gave his advice this would
lead to conflicting advice from Dyson Hayden [sic] and would have to put up to
the Board. Discussed the
issue with Greg Bateman. He agreed that the use of the
words `how many share you will be given' would be more suitable and that an
asterisk should be put after the first appearance of the word `free share' on
the carrier with the qualifying paragraph placed in
the margin on the inside of
the carrier. (By telephone conference)
<P>

<u>Attending Sean Barrett</u>  Advised of the changes. He is happy with these
(but has reservations about losing the use of the word `free')."
<P>

921	In describing these meetings I have placed them in the order in which Mrs
Storrs, the common participant, placed them in her
witness statement.  In her
oral evidence Mrs Storrs said that, on further consideration, she thought the
10.30 am meeting was the
first in time, and could not be certain of the order
of the two meetings involving Ms Conway.  Her reasoning was that the 10.30 am
meeting had exposed that an asterisk was not desirable, and so any abandonment
of the word "free" came afterwards.  
<P>

922	One difficulty with this is that what I have treated as the first meeting
and the last meeting both involved Ms Conway instructing
Mrs Storrs that use of
the word "free" was to be avoided, and the repetition after the 10.30am meeting
is unlikely.  The order of
the meetings as I have placed them is supported by
the evidence of Ms Conway.  According to Ms Conway, at the first meeting she
said
that she wanted the words "How many shares you will be given!" on the
front of the onsert because she thought it met the requirements
of Mr Heydon's
opinion.  As to the later meeting, she said that Mrs Storrs told her that the
public relations people wanted to retain
the phrase "free shares" on the front
of the onsert, but that she thought it was unacceptable and should not appear
because Mr Heydon
had expressed reservations about it;  although Mr Heydon had
given advice on overcoming the problem, she "personally wanted to take
a more
cautious course and not refer to `free shares' at all on the front of the
onsert".  I think the order of the meetings as I
have placed them is the more
likely.  
<P>

923	Mr Bateman was then contacted, and as her note shows Mrs Storrs also spoke
to Mr Barrett.  The discussion with Mr Bateman was
initiated by Mrs Storrs, but
then Ms Conway took the telephone or joined in the conversation by a speaker
phone.  
<P>

924	According to Mr Bateman, Ms Conway said that Mrs Storrs had spoken to her
about the proposed wording discussed at the meeting,
and that Mr Barrett and
she "have an alternative wording which we think is fine and we want to know
whether you agree with it". 
Mr Bateman asked what it was.  Ms Conway said, "On
the front cover of the carrier we want to put the words `How many shares you'll
be given'.  This omits any reference to `free'.  On the inside where the
instruction sheet is we'll put an asterisk where the words
`Free Shares" first
appear.  That's in the first line of the instruction sheet.  Then the wording
you agreed this morning would be
placed in the margin on that page in the same
type face as the main text."  Mr Bateman asked why it was being changed, and Ms
Conway
said that Mr Barrett did not like the asterisk on the front cover and
"If Heydon is so concerned at the last minute about `free'
on the front cover
then he won't object if we take it off the front cover".  
<P>

925	Still according to Mr Bateman, he replied, "That's true.  His concern was
only as to where `free' was first used".  Ms Conway
commented that the reader
was more likely to read the footnote if it was on the instructions page of the
carrier.  There was talk
about the colours on the onsert, Ms Conway's
suggestion was repeated, and the conversation concluded -
<P>

Mr Bateman :
<P>

"Yes. That seems to satisfy Dyson Heydon's concern.  As you know, he was
emphasising that where "free" first appeared, there should
be an indication of
the extent to which the shares are free and that something is being given up to
get the shares, namely the membership.
 If "free shares" is not used on the
front cover but the asterisk is used where "free shares" is first used on the
instructions side
of the carrier and the text is highlighted by a different
colour in the margin, that should be okay.  It would be best to put it
back in
front of Dyson Heydon to make sure it's okay."
<P>

Ms Conway:
<P>

"I've had enough of Dyson Heydon.  I think the proposal is fine and you seem
happy with it too.  You can give me an advice which
incorporates Dyson Heydon's
opinion."
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"How do you mean?"
<P>

Ms Conway:
<P>

"Just repeat what Heydon said.  Just regurgitate his written opinion, but only
in relation to the question "Are there any legal
issues arising from placing
the Acceptance of Free Shares form on the Proxy Voting Papers".  Don't deal
with the other question about
the front cover."
<P>

926	This conversation was briefly recorded in a file note of Mr Bateman dated 5
August 1994, reading -
<P>

"'How many shares you will be given' on front
<P>

In first line on inside put * where FREE first appears &amp; then put this 
<P>

morning's agreed wording in the margin - same type face as [indecipherable]
text".
<P>

927	Ms Conway did not agree entirely with this.  According to Ms Conway, she
said that she was not happy with "free shares" on the
front of the onsert, and
that the phrase "How many shares you will be given" had previously been
formulated and she preferred it.
 She asked for Mr Bateman's opinion, and he
said it would be "fine" and agreed that it should be on the front of the
onsert.  Ms
Conway did not recall the suggestion that the matter be "put ...
back in front of" Mr Heydon, and denied that she said that she had
had enough
of Mr Heydon.  She may have said that she did not think it necessary for Mr
Bateman to further brief Mr Heydon, because
two opinions had been received and
she was confident that all the issues Mr Heydon had raised had been addressed.
Further, according
to Ms Conway she said to Mr Bateman words to the effect,
"There is no need to brief Heydon QC again because Abbott Tout should be
able
now to give a final sign-off on the documents incorporating the advices which
Heydon QC had supplied within the last few days
and referring to the final form
of the onsert which you have agreed". 
<P>

928	Inherent in Mr Bateman's account of the discussion is that Ms Conway had
earlier talked to Mr Barrett about the alternative
involving "How many shares
you'll be given!".  That she had done so was part of a possible inference
earlier outlined.  Mrs Storrs'
file note of telling Mr Barrett of the changes
is consistent with this, in that Mr Barrett might have been told of the
decision.
 Mr Barrett's evidence added another layer of confusion.  He recalled
an occasion with Ms Conway and Mrs Storrs in Ms Conway's office
at which the
use of the asterisk and the arrow and the word "free" on the first page of the
onsert was discussed.   His recollection
was not clear, as he thought that the
use of an asterisk had been agreed on 2 August 1994, and he also recalled that
in the course
of the meeting in Ms Conway's office a telephone call was made to
Mr Bateman, which is not consistent with the file note.  Mr Barrett
said that
he was not happy with the use of the arrow, but was "comfortable with the use
of the asterisk", and that he preferred that
"free" not be used on the front
page with a qualification as it might deter recipients of the prospectus from
going further.  Mr
Barrett may have run events together.  
<P>

929	The result was clear, even if there were differences in the recollections
of how it came about.  What I think occurred may be
sufficiently summarised in
this way.  Following Mr Heydon's opinion of 3 August 1994, it was agreed that
"How many FREE shares you
will get!" would be left on the first page of the
onsert, with an asterisk after FREE and the explanatory words in the margin.
Mr
Barrett, Mr Fitch and others on the marketing and public relations side were
unhappy, even though Mr Barrett had been party to the
agreement, because an
asterisk and qualification on the first page was regarded as undesirable.  On
reflection Ms Conway preferred
what she saw as the more cautious course of not
referring to free shares at all on the first page.  Ms Conway and Mr Barrett
discussed
the different course of changing the words on the first page to "How
many shares you will be given!" and putting the asterisk when
"Free Shares"
first appeared on the second page with the explanatory words on that page.  Mr
Barrett was content, although he would
have preferred to keep free shares on
the first page.  Ms Conway told Mrs Storrs that she wanted to avoid the use of
free shares
on the first page, ahead of the 10.30 am meeting on 5 August 1994.
The meeting did not, however, take the more cautious course, because
Mr Fitch
and others wanted to keep free shares on the first page, and arrived at a
different course which did not involve an asterisk.
 When Ms Conway was told of
this, she put her foot down.  She consulted Mr Bateman, and obtained his
agreement that what she wanted
would meet Mr Heydon's concern.  Mr Barrett was
told of the decision.  Mr Bateman suggested returning to Mr Heydon, but Ms
Conway
did not want that and asked for an AT advice.
<P>

930	It is necessary to consider further what I have referred to as asking for
an AT advice.
<P>

931	The first page of the onsert now had "How to vote!  How many shares you
will be given!" instead of "How to vote!  How many FREE
shares you will get!".
On the second page, the first sentence reading "It is proposed that NRMA change
its status and issue Free
Shares* to members" now had the asterisk, which
directed the reader to the note in the bottom left-hand corner of that page,
"The
Free Shares (or cash alternative) are in exchange for membership under the
Articles of each of NRMA Ltd and NRMA Insurance Ltd. 
Whether you accept the
Free Shares or the cash alternative, Road Service and policies continue as
usual."  
<P>

932	The explanatory words were different from those in the version of the
onsert the subject of Mr Heydon's opinion of 3 August
1994, but not in a way
which detracted from the explanation.  So far as the now first reference to
free shares in the onsert was
qualified by the explanation, in a way (asterisk
plus note) found acceptable by Mr Heydon, his concern about the ambiguity of
"free"
could reasonably be regarded as met.  But the original exercise of
dealing with Ms Singleton's query had changed.  The first question
asked of Mr
Heydon remained as it had been.  The second question, whether there were any
legal issues arising from having on the
first page "How to vote!" in
combination with "How many FREE shares you will get!", had changed because the
second of the phrases
had been replaced by the different phrase "How many
shares you will be given!"
<P>

933	One consequence might have been that Ms Conway asked for advice only on the
first question, and according to Mr Bateman he was
told to "regurgitate [Mr
Heydon's] written opinion" in relation to the first question and not to deal
with "the other question about
the front cover".  This would have been an
unlikely consequence.  There could still have been a question in the
conjunction of "How
to vote!" with "How many shares you will be given!", and it
could have been expected that Ms Singleton would still see such a question:
 so
a modified second question was appropriate.  More importantly, Mr Heydon had
raised the free shares problem, he had expressed
the view in relation to a
previous version of the onsert that there was a legal issue but it would be
resolved favourably, and the
onsert had then been changed, so Ms Conway would
have wanted a similar opinion in relation to the changed version of the onsert.
That Ms Conway would have asked for a "final sign-off" on the onsert
"incorporating the advices which Heydon QC had supplied" was
only natural.
<P>

934	I accept up to a point Mr Bateman's evidence of the conversation with Ms
Conway on 5 August 1994.  I accept that he understood
Ms Conway as saying that
she only wanted advice on the first question, because the draft advice provided
by Mr Bateman on 9 August
1994 dealt only with that question.  But in the
circumstances I have described I think Mr Bateman misunderstood what Ms Conway
wanted,
and his recollection of the conversation in this respect has gone
astray.  I consider that Ms Conway said words more of the nature
she recalled.

<P>

935	As will appear, Ms Conway asked that the draft letter of advice be
expanded, Mr Bateman agreed, and the final letter of advice
was expanded
accordingly.  It is quite possible that Ms Conway did not make herself clear on
5 August 1994, and that when Mr Bateman
turned to the advice he thought that
the second question had fallen away and erroneously came to remember a
confining of Ms Conway's
request.  In any event, Mr Batman was asked for the
wider advice on 9 August 1994, and must have understood that request against
the background of Mr Heydon's opinions of 2 and 3 August 1994 and the changes
to the onsert.
<P>

936	Although concern over the free shares problem identified by Mr Heydon had
not been conveyed to the boards on 4 August 1994,
and although the advice in
due course provided, in response to Ms Singleton's query, on the final form of
the onsert did not explain
the events of 2-5 August 1994, the free shares
problem was not hidden.  The evidence of this was mainly, but not exclusively,
from
Mr Mackay.
<P>

937	Mr Mackay recalled either Ms Conway or Mr Bateman telling him that a
concern had been expressed that the use of the word "free"
on the onsert,
unqualified, might mislead members into thinking they were giving nothing away,
and that the onsert had therefore
been amended.  He did not recall that Mr
Heydon was identified as the person raising the concern, although it might have
been so.
 
<P>

938	At another point in his evidence Mr Mackay said that "We were told by Helen
Conway at either the meeting early in August or
18 August of advice from Mr
Heydon which related to the use of the word `free' on the onsert and the fact
that it was necessary to
refer to the fact that members were giving up their
rights as members of the Association in return for the shares", and this would
suggest that one or more of the boards was told of the free shares problem.
Later in his evidence Mr Mackay agreed that this occasion
was probably the
meeting of the board of Holdings on 8 August 1994, when the version of the
onsert without the reference to free
shares on the first page came before the
board.  Although he clearly enough did not have a good recollection, he agreed
that Ms Conway
said that an opinion had been received from Mr Heydon dealing
with Ms Singleton's query, and that Mr Heydon said that the use of
the word
"free" was ambiguous and needed to be clarified.  The gist of the conversation,
according to Mr Mackay, was that the onsert
had to be amended to make reference
to the fact that the members were giving up their rights.  Indeed, Mr Mackay
agreed that Ms Conway
said that the effect of Mr Heydon's opinion was either
that the word "free" was not used or the ambiguity was cured by adding
additional
words so as to highlight that people were giving something up in
return for the shares, although not money, and that for that reason
they had
taken the word "free" off the front of the onsert and used the asterisk inside
the onsert.  
<P>

939	As well, Mr Mackay's recollection was that there was discussion at the
other boards, though the other boards had not been informed
that the onsert had
to be amended, because Mr Heydon had indicated that he had some doubts about
its effectiveness if the word "free"
appeared without reference to the members
giving up their rights.  Mr Mackay's evidence may not have been entirely
consistent, and
his recollection was not precise, but the fact that the free
shares problem identified by Mr Heydon was not hidden is another reason
for
rejecting the suggested consciousness of neglect to which I have earlier
referred.
<P>

940	Mr Kirby said that the "qualification" in the onsert, that is, the asterisk
and marginal note, were on his understanding used
to make clear the sense in
which the word "free" was being used, and that it was unnecessary to address a
similar qualification of
the word used in the prospectus because the onsert was
at the beginning of the prospectus and covered the whole of the prospectus.
His recollection was that questioning the use of the word "free" arose in
connection with the notice of meeting in the prospectus,
and that Ms Conway
said that it was necessary to include in the notice of meeting that as part of
the legal changes the members of
Association and Insurance would no longer be
members in order to make clear the sense in which the members were giving
something
up in return for free shares.  Mr Kirby's recollection of this matter
is not reliable, but suggests some reference by Ms Conway to
a problem with
"free" and to overcoming the problem by express reference to giving up
membership rights.  Again, the free shares
problem was not hidden.
<P>

941	Mr Douglass gave evidence that his understanding of the changes to the
onsert to its form as at 18 August 1994 were made in
accordance with advice,
but he could not recall more or whether it was in connection with Ms
Singleton's query.  He recalled that
he was told, probably by Ms Conway, that
the change in the onsert by way of asterisk and additional words was to clarify
the position
concerning free shares on the onsert in accordance with advice
received.  
<P>

942	Ms Godwin recalled being told, she thought by Mr Bateman, that Mr Heydon
"had difficulty with the word `free'" on the onsert,
and being told by either
Ms Conway or Mr Bateman that "free" was not going to be on the onsert, all
prior to 18 August 1994.  The
extent of her recollection was that the problem
was that "free" was on the front of the onsert without any qualification.
<P>

<b>Final advice on the onsert</b>
<P>

943	The onsert was now in its final form.  A meeting of the board of Holdings
was held on the afternoon of 8 August 1994.  Present
were Mr Mackay,
Mr Kirby, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Jack and Mr Willing, and those
in attendance included Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, Dr Werner,
and
Mr Morgan.  The minutes recorded a resolution "to approve the wording,
layout and design of the 4/8/94 version of the onsert
forms which had been
previously distributed with the draft Prospectus".  The most recent version of
the onsert was the 5 August 1994
version.  Why the board was presented
with the earlier version was unclear.  When the onsert next attracted attention
at board level,
on 18 August 1994, it must have been put forward in its final
form.
<P>

944	On 9 August 1994 Mr Bateman provided to Ms Conway a "draft letter of
opinion in relation to the onserts", asking if she wished
him to consider any
changes.  A change was requested, and is best understood with reference to the
draft letter.
<P>

945	The draft letter began with language similar to that in the letters to Mr
Heydon, referring to the package containing the prospectus
and onsert.  It
said, "The form of onsert which will apply to the circumstances of most members
(situation 3 - C) is <u>enclosed</u>.  It is the 4 August version."  Why Mr
Bateman referred to the 4 August 1994 version of the onsert, and not the 5
August 1994 version,
is also unclear.
<P>

946	The draft letter then set out a question, an answer, and reasons - 
<P>

"<b>2.	YOUR QUESTION</b>
<P>

You have asked the following question:
<P>

`Are there any legal issues arising from the placement of the Acceptance of
Free Shares form on the Proxy Voting Papers?  Could
it be suggested, for
example, that if this were regarded as an attempt to induce members to vote
"Yes", that it was an unfair inducement
with legal ramifications?'
<P>

<b>3.	OUR SHORT ANSWER</b>
<P>

3.1	We do not believe that there is any such inducement.
<P>

3.2	Any legal issues that might be said to arise from such placement have been
properly and fairly addressed.
<P>

<b>4.	REASONS FOR OUR ANSWER</b>
<P>

4.1	The Proxy Voting Papers make it very clear that there is a choice as to
whether you vote `yes' or `no'.  The Acceptance of Free
Shares form, under its
heading, clearly states that even if the person has voted `no', they should
complete the Acceptance of Free
Shares form.  Again, the instruction sheet, at
the first dot point against `remember to check', emphasises that regardless of
whether
the person votes they should fill in the Acceptance of Free Shares
form.
<P>

4.2	The issuing of the onsert is subject to a range of controls, including:
<P>

(a)	the general law, including the law relating to the holding of meetings and
providing fair information to members;
<P>

(b)	the Corporations Law, including Chapter 7 dealing with prospectuses;
<P>

(c)	the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, including its comprehensive provision in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
52.</a>
<P>

4.3	Having considered these issues, we do not believe that there are any legal
implications arising from the placement of the Acceptance
of Free Shares form
on the Proxy Voting Papers.
<P>

4.4	If at least 75% of the votes are cast in the affirmative, members will
obtain a valuable benefit, either shares in Holdings
or cash.  No doubt that
benefit is a strong inducement to each member to vote `yes'.  But that would be
so whether the `Acceptance
of Free Shares' form appeared on the same page as
the `Proxy Voting Paper' or not.  It is difficult to see why any greater
incentive
in favour of a `yes' vote flows from the proposed placement.
<P>

4.5	The relevant principles of law were summarised thus ...
<P>

	[Here the letter set out extracts from some cases]
<P>

4.8	Even if the documents were read quickly, and by a non-specialist, they do
not mislead, and they contain adequate information
to convey the point that the
member has 2 choices:  to indicate how, if a proxy is to be employed, the proxy
is to vote for or against
the changes, and to indicate, even if the proxy vote
is negative, whether the member is to get shares or cash in the event that
there
is sufficiently large positive majority.  We do not see how that point
could be put more clearly.  We certainly do not think that
the form could
create `some serious misapprehension of the position'.
<P>

4.9	We conclude, therefore, that any legal issues that might be said to arise
from the placement of the Acceptance of Free Shares
form on the Proxy Voting
Papers have been properly and fairly addressed."
<P>

947	It will be seen that the draft letter addressed only the first question
asked of Mr Heydon.  It could fairly be said to have
regurgitated his opinion
in that respect.
<P>

948	Ms Conway telephoned Mr Bateman, whose file note recorded that she asked
him to "state view that onsert otherwise complies".
 According to Mr Bateman,
he asked what Ms Conway meant, and Ms Conway said, "I want you to state that
its form and content also
complies with the general law.  Just add it as a
paragraph at the end of the letter.  Your letter will have to be for the final
version
of the onsert.  I'll send you up the latest version so that it can form
part of your letter."  According to Ms Conway, there was
consciously a request
for advice going beyond Ms Singleton's query.  She said that Mr Bateman "was to
sign off the onsert in any
event and I asked him to do that in this letter, so
we had one letter that addressed Jane Singleton's query, plus a general
sign-off
on the onsert".  I accept that this was Ms Conway's intention, an
intention consistent with what I think she meant to convey on 5
August 1994.
It was stated broadly to Mr Bateman, who does not seem to have inquired
further. 
<P>

949	In due course Mr Bateman provided to Ms Conway the final advice in relation
to the onsert, a letter dated 15 August 1994.  It
followed the draft of 9
August 1994, save that it referred to the (then most recent) 10 August 1994
version of the onsert and, consistently
with Ms Conway's request that it "state
view that onsert otherwise complies", the concluding paragraph now read in
place of the previous
para 4.9 (which was reproduced as sub-para 5.1) -
<P>

"<b>5.	CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

5.1	We conclude that any legal issues that might be said to arise from the
placement of the Acceptance of Free Shares form on the
Proxy Voting Papers have
been properly and fairly addressed.
<P>

5.2	We have also considered the form and content of the onsert as a whole and
consider that it satisfies the general law requirements
for such a document in
the context in which it is to be used."
<P>

950	It was not particularly satisfactory to tack para 5.2 on to a letter
written with original regard to the question asked in para
2 and answered in
para 5.1.  Nonetheless, through para 5.2 the letter did provide a sign-off on
the onsert, with a reservation of
some imprecision, "such a document in the
context in which it is to be used".  The sub-paragraph was consistent with the
opinion
then held by Mr Bateman, and indeed by Ms Conway, that the problem in
describing the shares as free shares seen by Mr Heydon still
existed in the
words "Free Shares" on the second page of the onsert even though the words on
the first page "How many FREE shares
you will get!" were no longer used, but
that the problem was cured by the asterisk and explanatory note.  The cure was
such that,
while an issue remained, it would be resolved favourably to the
NRMA, and so the satisfaction in para 5.2 could be stated.
<P>

951	In his evidence Mr Bateman said that he intended in his reference to
general law requirements to exclude (relevantly) s 52 of
the TP Act.  This was
criticised by the NRMA as either evidence which should not be accepted or, if
the evidence was accepted, a
subterfuge practised on the NRMA.  
<P>

952	That Mr Bateman did so intend finds some support in the distinction in para
4.2 of the draft and final letters between the general
law, the Law, and the TP
Act, and in Mr Bateman's recollection of Ms Conway's request to state that the
form and content of the onsert
complied with the general law.  But it is
improbable that, even if Ms Conway referred to compliance with the general law,
she meant
to exclude compliance with the Law and the TP Act.  She wanted a
general sign-off on the onsert.  It is also improbable that Mr Bateman
would
have understood Ms Conway to want a restricted sign-off, and if the reference
to free shares was misleading for the purposes
of s 52 of the TP Act it would
probably cause the onsert to infringe the general law relating to providing
fair information to members.
 
<P>

953	I think it likely that Ms Conway did use language such as compliance with
the general law, meaning compliance otherwise than
in respect of the specific
first question asked of Mr Heydon, and that Mr Bateman used the same language
in the letter intending
to encompass compliance with the Law and the TP Act.
Had he done otherwise, without explanation, he would not have been acting in
the interests of the NRMA.  I do not accept that the letter of 15 August 1994
excluded compliance with (relevantly) s 52 of the TP
Act, or was intended to do
so.
<P>

<b>The prospectus reaches its final form</b>
<P>

954	The current version of the prospectus was considered by the due diligence
committee at a meeting on 3 August 1994.  There was
particular attention to
disclosure of disadvantages.  
<P>

955	There had been a number of changes over the preceding weeks to the
statements in the prospectus to the effect that the boards
recommended the
proposal, and Ms Godwin drew attention to that part of the prospectus.  Mr
Mackay asked what happened if the recommendation
was by a majority of directors
and was not unanimous - was it necessary to disclose that the recommendation
was a majority decision?
 
<P>

956	Mr Bateman reiterated that the obligation was to disclose all information
reasonably necessary to enable the members to understand
the issues and
determine whether to vote and, if so, whether to vote for or against.  He said
that as part of the obligation it would
be material for a member to know
whether the recommendation of the directors was by a majority vote as opposed
to an unanimous vote,
and indeed to know the numbers.  Mr Bateman said, "Of
course the reasons for the minority voting against would also be material and
have to be included in Section 1.  Even if a director is in favour of the
proposal he or she must give all material information and
not just material
that is favourable."  
<P>

957	There were then comments to the effect that it was not clear whether
directors would vote against, that Ms Singleton might in
the end abstain, that
the only thing Mr Talbot had "come up with" was that the listed company would
be subject to takeover by big
companies, that Miss Fraser would probably go
along with Mr Talbot and Ms Singleton, and that Mr Lawson would probably
support the
proposal.  Dr Werner observed, "They just haven't come up with any
reasons really.  They have been asked several times and they have
come up with
nothing which is not in Section 1."  
<P>

958	According to Mr Bateman, the discussion then continued -
<P>

Mr Bateman:  
<P>

"Well Section 1 is the directors' document.  It's their statement to the
members of all that is material for a member to know. 
If there is a minority
who votes against, that fact, the numbers voting, and their reasons insofar as
they are known, will have to
be included."
<P>

Mr Mackay:
<P>

"I think Section 1 is good.  It canvasses the issues fairly.  The issues of
tax, takeovers, and the like, we've gone to a lot of
trouble to resolve
favourably.  I think Section 1 has all material information in it and presents
it fairly.  John, what's your view
on the prospectus?  Do you feel that there
has been adequate disclosure?"
<P>

Mr Morgan:
<P>

"Chairman, Section 1 is the document that the directors of Association and
Insurance have to satisfy themselves on.  They have to
provide all material
information in there.  The other Sections of the prospectus are more
particularly the responsibility of the
directors of Holdings.  The DDC and the
prospectus working group have, over quite some time, reviewed and drafted all
parts of the
prospectus and factored in all the comments from the directors.
There is nothing that has come to my attention in that process that
is material
that has been omitted.
<P>

Under Section 1022 of the Corporations Law the prospectus must contain all such
information as investors and their professional
advisers would reasonably
require, and reasonably expect to find in the prospectus, for the purpose of
making an informed assessment
of the financial position of the Group.  Under
Section 995 the prospectus must not mislead or deceive by what it says or omits
to
say.  Where representations are made as to the future, the directors must
under Section 765 have a reasonable basis for doing so.
<P>

Chairman, from the review undertaken the disclosure in the prospectus is
adequate to comply with Section 1022 and the other relevant
sections of the
Corporations Law'."
<P>

959	This was minuted as a note that "advice was provided to the Committee that
the disclosure in the draft Prospectus was adequate
to comply with Section 1022
of the Corporations Law as well as all other relevant sections".  That
something to this effect was said
was not disputed.
<P>

960	The prospectus was still being changed, including a change flowing from the
recent approval by the Stock Exchange of a 5 per
cent shareholding cap.  This
led to Mr Bateman providing to Ms Godwin on 4 August 1994 the part of Section 1
as it finally appeared
posing and answering the question, "Can the NRMA be
taken over if it issues shares?"  
<P>

961	A joint meeting of the boards of Association and Insurance was held on 4
August 1994.  One of the items on the agenda was "Prospectus
- Section 1".
There was discussion of Section 1, the detail of which was not disclosed in the
evidence, but as earlier noted Ms Singleton
did say that she was concerned that
voting yes was a requirement to get the free shares and Ms Conway said, "We're
getting an opinion
on that.  We'll be able to give it to you at the next
meeting."  No other matters of concern in relation to the prospectus, or the
onsert, were mentioned.  
<P>

962	It was suggested to Ms Conway that she deliberately did not tell the boards
more, at this meeting or later, and deliberately
did not provide to them Mr
Heydon's opinions of 2 and 3 August 1994, because she did not want the
attention of the boards drawn to
a possible problem with the language of free
shares;  further, it was suggested that that was why she asked Mr Bateman to
provide
an AT letter of advice in relation to the onsert.  As part of this, it
seemed to be suggested that Ms Conway had earlier requested
that Mr Heydon's
second opinion be a stand-alone opinion because it might have been suitable for
presentation to the boards without
disclosure of any problem concerning free
shares.  Ms Conway denied this, and I accept her denial.  As I have already
said, it made
sense for Ms Singleton's query to be dealt with by legal advice
addressing the onsert in its final form, and the free shares problem
was not
hidden and was made known to various members of the boards.
<P>

963	A version of the prospectus as at 5 August 1994 was distributed on that
day.  It included the material relating to "Can the
NRMA be taken over if it
issues shares?"  The question of a "no" case was still alive;  for example, Mr
Mackay received a news service
report that the Labour Council had resolved "to
request presentations for and against the float from the NRMA management and
board
member, Jane Singleton".  A file note made by Mr Simpson recording a
meeting of Mr Mackay, Mr Willing, (someone else indecipherable),
Ms Conway and Mr Bateman on 5 August 1994 included "Why no `no'
case", with an arrow pointing to a box containing the word "strong".
 What lay
behind this was unclear, but clearly enough there was questioning of a "no"
case.  
<P>

964	The prospectus working group spent seven hours going through the prospectus
on 7 August 1994.  It was a large group, and on
this occasion Mr Willing was in
attendance.  Ms Godwin, Mr Morgan, and Mr Bateman were amongst the usual
participants.  A particular
matter connected with that day attracted some
attention in the hearing.  
<P>

965	Mr J&ouml;rgen Nielsen was a partner of AAH who, at Mr Morgan's request,
had read and commented on the various drafts of the
prospectus.  The draft as
at 7 August 1994 included in the Section containing definitions and technical
terms the definition of "Free
Shares" noted much earlier in these reasons,
meaning "the NRMA shares offered to members under the Members Free Offer".  The
definition
had been in the draft for some time.  Mr Nielsen's annotations on
this draft included, next to the definition, "?  In return for
their existing
membership.  ?  Road Service and policies continue as usual".  The annotation
reflected the words recently added to
the second page of the onsert, and Mr
Morgan's copy of the same version of the prospectus included an annotation
against the definition
of Free Shares, "As per onsert".  
<P>

966	It was suggested that Mr Nielsen, and separately or with him Mr Morgan, had
considered whether the prospectus should be amended
by adding something to the
definition of Free Shares to describe the shares as in return for membership.
That would have required
some further amendments, since the definition of Free
Shares took up the definition of Members Free Offer and was not amenable to
such a simple alteration.  
<P>

967	Mr Nielsen said that he did not recall why he made his annotation, but that
it was not because he considered that by reason
of the expression Free Shares
the prospectus was misleading.  He said he had no such concern, and that if he
had had such a concern
he would not have suggested a change only to the
definition of Free Shares.  His belief was that he made the annotation so that
the
definition of Free Shares would be consistent with the explanation given to
that expression on the onsert (according to Mr Nielsen
he had the 4 August 1994
version of the onsert in which the qualifying words appeared on the first
page), and he said that while
he had been told that those words had been added
as a result of a QC's advice he did not recall being told the QC's reasons for
the
advice and was not shown a copy of the advice.  
<P>

968	Mr Morgan agreed that his note was to record at least a suggestion that the
definition of "Free Shares" contain a qualification
similar to that which had
been made on the onsert, although he did not recall a discussion with Mr
Neilsen or anyone else on that
matter.  He agreed that he raised the amendment
at the meeting on 7 August 1994, and said that the suggestion was not taken up.
His
recollection was that Mr Bateman said that he (Mr Bateman) did not believe
the change was necessary, and that he (Mr Morgan) "didn't
object to the fact
that the definition was not changed, the meeting having decided that they
didn't want to change it".  Mr Morgan
did not think it necessary to raise the
same matter at a due diligence committee meeting.
<P>

969	Mr Bateman said that he had no recollection of Mr Morgan proposing a change
to the definition of Free Shares in the prospectus,
and no recollection of
expressing a view that any such amendment would be unnecessary.  He agreed
that, if such a matter had been
raised at the prospectus working group meeting,
he would have been happy to adopt the change, but would not have considered it
necessary
to make it.  
<P>

970	The annotation made by Mr Morgan would probably have led to him raising a
possible change for consideration by others in the
prospectus working group,
and Ms Godwin had a very vague recollection, possibly with some connection with
being told about Mr Heydon's
difficulty with the word "free" in the onsert, of
discussion about the use of the word "free" in the prospectus and "what
qualification
needed to be used for that".  I do not think her recollection can
really be regarded as reliable, but it is consistent with the matter
coming up
on 7 August 1994.  Mr Barrett had a recollection, although he could not fix it
in time or place, of a discussion in connection
with settling the final form of
the prospectus in which consideration was given as to whether it was necessary
to qualify the definition
of Free Shares having regard to the additional words
used in the onsert.  Again I do not think this is a reliable recollection, but
it is consistent with something such as was said to have occurred on 7 August
1994 even if, as seems to have been the case, Mr Barrett
was not present at the
meeting on 7 August 1994.  I accept the substance of Mr Morgan's evidence in
this respect. 
<P>

971	Clearly enough, therefore, Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman both gave some thought
after the events of 2-3 August 1994 to whether the
description of the shares as
free shares in the prospectus was misleading because of the ambiguity to which
Mr Heydon had referred.
 They both concluded that it was not.  It does not
follow from his suggestion that Mr Morgan saw a real concern, and I do not
think
he did.  I am satisfied that he thought Mr Heydon was over-cautious in
relation to the onsert, and in any event thought the prospectus
sufficiently
disclosed that the members would be giving up their rights in return for their
shares in Holdings.  Mr Bateman, for
his part, did not think there was a
problem with the description of the shares as free shares, and saw a statement
or statements
to the effect that members were giving up membership rights in
return for the shares as part of the general obligation to inform
members
rather than a clarification to remove ambiguity;  he thought the members were
sufficiently informed in the prospectus as
it stood.  Perceived neatness and
consistency between the onsert and the prospectus could adequately explain what
happened, and I
do not think there was anything more than that. 
<P>

972	A further matter from this meeting should be noted.  Flowing from the
meeting of the joint boards on 3 August 1994, Mr Bateman
had drafted material
for inclusion in the prospectus posing and answering the question, "Are all the
directors in favour of the proposal?".
 The draft provided for numbers for and
against the proposal, and for a summary-
<P>

"Overall, therefore, there are .......... directors who are recommending the
proposal to members.  Their reasons are incorporated
in Section 1 - Information
for Members.  The reasons the other .......... directors are against it, so far
as those reasons have
been expressed, are raised and answered in this section
of the prospectus."
<P>

Ms Godwin asked at the meeting of 7 August 1994 whether it was necessary to
include the last sentence in this extract.  According
to Mr Bateman, the
conversation went -
<P>

Ms Godwin:
<P>

"Greg, is it really necessary to make that last statement?  If Talbot or others
are going to vote against the proposal that's one
thing that will have been
disclosed.  Their reasons for doing so is another matter altogether.  As I
understand it, none of the directors,
let alone Talbot or Singleton, has put
forward any reason as to why the proposal should not go ahead beyond any of the
matters which
have already been covered in Section 1.  I understand that
Richard Talbot has only talked about takeovers and we have gone as far
as we
can in trying to protect against takeovers and that has been identified in
Section 1 already.  That being the case, is there
any need for that last
sentence?"
<P>

Mr Bateman:
<P>

"As you know, the obligation is to put before members all material information
to enable them to decide on the issue.  What is material
includes reasons for,
and against, so, even if a director is in favour of the proposal he or she must
give all material information
and not just material that is favourable.  If the
only issues that have come up which are against the proposal are already
canvassed
in Section 1, then there is no need to make that last statement.'
<P>

Ms Godwin:
<P>

`There is nothing else which is material that I know of.  Section 1 covers all
issues which are material.  That being the case,
we can omit the last
sentence."
<P>

I accept that something to this effect was said.
<P>

973	The prospectus working group met again on 8 and 9 August 1994, making
changes including changes flowing from comments received
from persons verifying
the prospectus as part of the due diligence process.  Ms Godwin stated that 9
August 1994 was the last date
for changes.
<P>

974	That was not so, and some more changes were made, but for present purposes
they do not matter.  The final version of the prospectus
was that dated
15 August 1994, although even it went to the boards on 18 August 1994 with
a separate paper gathering together a number
of amendments and corrections. 
<P>

<b>The sign-off letters</b>
<P>

975	The board approvals on 18 August 1994 included regard, in the manner I will
describe, to the sign-off letters of AAH and AT.
 The sign-off letters were
part of the due diligence process.  I have referred to the establishment of the
due diligence committee,
and to a number of occasions on which the prospectus
or the onsert came before it.  There was, of course, much more to which the
due
diligence committee was attending, and what I have said to this point is far
from exhaustive.  It is enough, for present purposes,
to take up a little more
detail in August 1994.
<P>

976	At the meeting of the due diligence committee on 8 August 1994 Mr Morgan
tabled what were called drafts of due diligence materials,
namely, a report
from the due diligence committee to the board of Holdings, an opinion from AAH,
a verification report, and a final
legal due diligence report.  
<P>

977	The report to the board of Holdings was intended to convey that, after due
enquiry, the members of the board could properly
sign the prospectus, and the
other materials were intended to underpin it.  The underpinning by the
verification report was by its
description of the work done to verify the
statements in the prospectus.  The underpinning by the legal due diligence
report was
by its description of legal issues perceived as arising and the
action taken, and it was matched by an accounting due diligence report
which
had already been received.  The underpinning by the opinion from AAH was by its
statements, subject to qualifications and assumptions,
of satisfaction as to
the due diligence process and its result.  The opinion from AAH was its
sign-off letter, the 8 August 1994
draft of which was later amended:  I will
come to the final sign-off letter shortly.  
<P>

978	Apart from the AAH sign-off letter, which in its draft form as at 8 August
1994 was directed to the prospectus in general, a
sign-off letter was provided
by AT directed to Section 1 of the prospectus.  
<P>

979	In April 1994 Mr Bateman had written to Mr Rees outlining AT's role in
relation to the due diligence process.  AT was to participate
in the process,
but "would not provide an opinion letter or sign-off to either the DDC or the
Board of NRMA Holdings Limited, as
these matters would be covered by the
opinion letter of Allens".  If this was then accepted as part of AT's role, the
position changed.
 
<P>

980	According to Mr Morgan, he asked Mr Bateman for "an opinion on Section 1 of
the prospectus" some time in July 1994.  According
to Mr Bateman, he was not
asked until 8 August 1994.  On Mr Bateman's account, after the meeting of the
due diligence committee on
that day Mr Morgan said that he (Mr Bateman) should
give an opinion on Section 1 of the prospectus, as he had been more involved
in
that Section, and Ms Conway concurred.  Mr Bateman asked what he should cover,
and Ms Conway said, "Just that it complies with
what the general law requires
for disclosure, something like that.  Don't worry about anything beyond that.
John is signing off overall
on both the general law and the legislation".  Mr
Bateman said, "You know that in relation to the question about the acceptance
of
free shares being on the proxy voting paper you asked me to just regurgitate
Dyson Heydon's opinion.  It deals with the general law
in this area.  If I
regurgitated Dyson Heydon's opinion in relation to Section 1 would that be
acceptable?".  Ms Conway said that
it "would be fine".  
<P>

981	Ms Conway denied saying anything about regurgitating Mr Heydon's opinion in
relation to Section 1, but otherwise seemed to accept
that there was an
exchange on 8 August 1994 about an AT sign-off letter.  There may have been
earlier mention of AT providing the
legal assurance in relation to Section 1 of
the prospectus, but I accept that the effective request was made in August
1994.  Ms
Conway's regurgitation denial seemed to be because Mr Heydon had not
given any opinion in relation to Section 1;  so she would not
have said
anything involving that he had.  The answer, I think, is that Mr Bateman was
referring to Mr Heydon's opinion so far as
it set out the general law, which it
did, as distinct from its application of the law in dealing with Ms Singleton's
query.  Mr Bateman
would regurgitate the general law, and then apply it in
relation to Section 1.  That is what in substance he did.  I accept Mr
Bateman's
evidence of the effective request.
<P>

982	On 9 August 1994, at the same time as he provided to Ms Conway the draft
letter in relation to the onsert, Mr Bateman provided
to her (and to Mr Morgan)
a draft letter in relation to Section 1 of the prospectus.  He asked if Ms
Conway wished him to consider
any changes.  Ms Conway telephoned Mr Bateman and
said that she was happy with the draft.  In fact a change was made in the final
letter.  Again it is best understood with prior reference to the draft.
<P>

983	The draft letter began by identifying the prospectus and Section 1
within it:  the identification left the date of the prospectus
blank.  It then
read -
<P>

"2.	<b><u>YOUR QUESTION</u></b>
<P>

	You have asked whether the content of the `Information for Members' satisfies
the requirements of the general law concerning material
to be supplied to
members in relation to the notices of general meeting for each of NRMA Ltd and
N.R.M.A. Insurance Ltd.
<P>

3.	<b><u>OUR ANSWER</u></b>
<P>

	We are of the opinion that the content of the `Information for Members'
satisfies those requirements of the general law."
<P>

984	There was then discussion in para 4 of the letter of what the general law
required, sufficiently summarised as the provision
of material substantially
full and true and sufficient to enable an understanding and judgment upon the
relevant business.  This
part of the letter really repeated the equivalent part
of the draft letter in relation to the onsert, and was clearly enough founded
on Mr Heydon's opinion.  
<P>

985	Para 5 then set out those for whose benefit AT's opinion was given, being
Association, Insurance, Holdings, Perpetual, the directors
of each of those
companies, and the other members of the due diligence committee (they included
Mr Morgan), and sought to exclude
reliance by anyone else.  It ended, "This
opinion is strictly limited to the matters stated in it and does not apply by
implication
to any other matters".
<P>

986	The change in the final letter was in part suggested by Mr Morgan.  On 10
August 1994 Mr Morgan telephoned Mr Bateman, and said
that he (Mr Morgan) was
not going to express any opinion on a member's entitlement to shares or cash,
but was going to assume that
the board had made a decision that it constituted
a fair and equitable distribution of the entitlement.  Mr Morgan said that he
was
not prepared to sign off on that area because "it's one where oppression
could occur.  It is a matter for the board to determine".
 Mr Bateman must have
decided to do the same, and his file note of the conversation with Mr Morgan
was to the effect that it should
be assumed that the basis of entitlement was
fair and equitable and "exclude from Section 1".  
<P>

987	On 10 August 1994 Mr Bateman sent to Ms Conway (and Mr Morgan) a fresh
draft of the sign-off letter, the same as before except
that there was added at
the beginning of para 5 -
<P>

"5.1	Obviously, the formulation of the proposal, particularly the basis of
entitlement of members to Free Shares, is a matter for
the directors of NRMA
Holdings Ltd, NRMA Ltd and N.R.M.A. Insurance Ltd.  Our option assumes that the
apportionment of those entitlements
constitutes a fair and equitable
distribution.  The opinion we express in this letter is, therefore, directed to
whether the `Information
for Members' material addresses the proposal (so
formulated by the NRMA) in a way which satisfies the requirements of the
general
law.
<P>

5.2	Our opinion is not directed to whether the resolution of members will bind
all members.  The matter is addressed in a written
opinion from Mr J D Heydon
QC who was briefed by Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley."
<P>

988	Paragraph 5.1 addressed what Mr Morgan had raised.  Paragraph 5.2, however,
went further, and excluded from AT's sign-off "whether
the resolution of
members will bind all members".  The opinion from Mr Heydon must have been his
opinion of 28 July 1994.  The final
letter was in the form of this fresh
draft.
<P>

989	This must have brought further attention to the AAH sign-off letter, which
as I have said in its then draft form was directed
to the prospectus in
general.  
<P>

990	Also on 10 August 1994 Mr Morgan sent to Ms Conway (and Mr Bateman) a fresh
draft of the AAH sign-off letter.  His covering
letter included -
<P>

"We understand Abbot [sic] Tout will be providing an opinion relating to the
question as to satisfactory disclosure of information
to members for the
purposes of the annual general meeting and a copy of that has been separately
circulated.  We also note that,
as agreed, a copy of the opinion of Mr Dyson
Heydon on the question as to whether the shares may be fully paid up by NRMA
Holdings
in consideration of members agreeing to give up their membership and
on the question as to whether the resolution of members will
bind all members
at the general meeting will be tabled at the due diligence committee meeting.
Senior counsel confirms in each case
that shares may be so issued and the
resolution will be so binding.  If anyone wishes to see a copy of that opinion
prior to the
due diligence committee meeting, please advise and I will forward
a copy to you.
<P>

You will note that in the opinion letter we have added an additional assumption
and that is that the distribution of entitlements
constitutes a fair and
equitable distribution.  This is really an issue for NRMA Limited and NRMA
Insurance Limited.  It goes to
the issue as to whether or not a successful suit
for oppression could be brought by members by reason of the fact that they were
either not properly compensated for giving up their membership or their
compensation was inappropriate in comparison with the compensation
paid to
others.  As we understand the position, the Boards of NRMA Limited and NRMA
Insurance Limited satisfied themselves in approving
the entitlements proposal
that the entitlements meet these requirements."
<P>

The fresh draft was now addressed to Perpetual as well as Holdings (and the
draft was also sent to Perpetual's solicitors).  
<P>

991	The final AAH letter was relevantly in the form of this fresh draft, but
with an additional qualification concerning reliance
on AT's sign-off as to
Section 1 of the prospectus.  The additional qualification must have come from
further consideration in the
light of the proposed AT sign-off, in order to
avoid overlapping.
<P>

992	The final letter began by describing two categories of information in the
prospectus, being financial information and forecasts
(in the letter called
"Financial Provisions") and other information (in the letter called "General
Provisions").  The role of AAH
as "solicitors to the Offer" was then described,
in summary the role of advising on the content of the General Provisions and
advising
on and participating in the due diligence process.  
<P>

993	The letter then said -
<P>

"<b>3.	Contents of the Prospectus</b>
<P>

We confirm that, subject to the qualifications and assumptions set out in
section 6, nothing has come to our attention in the course
of or as a result of
performance of our role that causes us to believe that:
<P>

(a)	the Prospectus (excluding the Financial Provisions) contains any material
statement that is false or misleading;
<P>

(b)	there is any material omission from the Prospectus (excluding the Financial
Provisions);  or
<P>

(c)	the issue of the Prospectus (excluding the Financial Provisions) may
involve conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely
to mislead or
deceive.
<P>

<b>4.	Due Diligence with respect to the Prospectus</b>
<P>

We confirm that we concur with the Due Diligence System and the scope of the
Due Diligence Enquiries agreed by the Due Diligence
Committee in relation to
matters concerning the Prospectus, except in relation to the Financial
Provisions as to which our role and
opinion is limited as specified below, and
on the basis of the qualifications and assumptions set out in section 6:
<P>

(a)	we believe that the Due Diligence System and the Due Diligence Enquiries
constitute:
<P>

(i)	reasonable enquiries within the meaning of Sections 996(2), 1008A and
1022(2) of the Corporations Law;  and
<P>

(ii)	reasonable precautions and the exercise of due diligence, within the
meaning of Section 1011 of the Corporations Law,
<P>

to ensure that there is no material statement in the Prospectus which is false
or misleading and that there are no material omissions
from the Prospectus;
and
<P>

(b)	in our opinion, the Due Diligence System has been implemented and the Due
Diligence Enquiries in which we participated as described
above have been
completed in accordance with the Planning Memorandum.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>5.	Verification Report</b>
<P>

We confirm that the Verification Report does not disclose any matter in
relation to the Prospectus (excluding the Financial Provisions)
which would
cause us to amend the confirmations given above in sections 3 and 4.
<P>

<b>6.	Qualifications and Assumptions</b>
<P>

Our confirmations above are subject to the following qualifications.
<P>

(a)	We are one of Holdings and NRMA Group's solicitors in Australia having
Australian legal expertise and our opinion is given only
to the extent that we,
having the role described above, could reasonably be expected to have become
aware of relevant facts and/or
to have identified the implications of those
facts.
<P>

(b)	We have not positively verified any statement except those statements in
relation to which we have been identified as the Person
Responsible.  In
relation to the other matters we have only collated verification materials
supplied to us.  We note that verification
of the Financial Provisions has been
undertaken by the independent Accountant.
<P>

(c)	This opinion relates to the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the
States and Territories of the Commonwealth of Australia
in force at the date of
this opinion.  We do not express or imply any opinion as to the laws of any
other jurisdiction and have made
no independent investigations in relation to
those laws.
<P>

(d)	We have relied on the opinion of Abbott Tout dated on or about the date of
this letter relating to the information for members
contained in the
Prospectus.
<P>

(e)	We have relied on the following searches only of public records on file on
the following dates:
<P>

Searches of public records on file at the office of the Australian Securities
Commission on 17 August 1994 in respect of Holdings
and the NRMA Group.
<P>

We note that records disclosed by such searches may not be complete or up to
date.
<P>

In giving this opinion we have assumed the following matters:
<P>

(a)	that the responses to the questions which we have put to the officers,
directors and agents of Holdings and NRMA Group members
and of Perpetual
Trustee Company Limited have been true and accurate in all respects and have
contained no omissions;
<P>

(b)	that the distribution of entitlements to the NRMA Shares constitutes a fair
and equitable distribution;
<P>

(c)	the authenticity of all seals and signatures and of any duty stamp or
marking;
<P>

(d)	the completeness and the conformity to original documents or instruments of
all copies examined by us;
<P>

(e)	that the documents examined by us are within the capacity and powers of,
and have been validly authorised, executed and delivered
by and are binding on,
the signatories to them;
<P>

(f)	that insofar as any obligation under any document examined by us is to be
performed in any jurisdiction outside Australia, its
performance will not be
illegal or ineffective by virtue of the law of that jurisdiction;  and 
<P>

(g)	the accuracy of all certificates, letters and opinions given by external
advisers of Holdings and the NRMA Group in relation
to the documents examined
by us.
<P>

(h)	that the resolutions of the boards of directors of Holdings, NRMA Limited
and NRMA Insurance Limited referred to in the Verification
Report are duly
passed at meetings of those boards held today.
<P>

Our enquiries in the course of performing our role in the Due Diligence System
have not given rise to any belief on our part that
such assumptions are not
correct."
<P>

994	The letter ended with a description of those for whose benefit the opinion
was given, a disclaimer, and a statement of limitation,
in like manner to the
AT sign-off letter.  
<P>

995	Some comments on the sign-off letters may be made.  As I have said, the
opinion of Mr Heydon to which the AT letter referred
must have been his opinion
of 28 July 1994.  It was in fact tabled at the due diligence committee meeting
on 15 August 1994.  It
may be that exclusion from the AT sign-off of "whether
the resolution of members will bind all members" reflected continuing doubt
on
Mr Bateman's part as to the scheme or meeting question, so that he took care to
leave the opinion on that to Mr Heydon and AAH.
 If so, Mr Bateman did not
reiterate or refer to any continuing doubt.  Paragraph 3 of the AAH sign-off
letter was in terms not an
opinion to the effect that the prospectus was not
misleading, but a statement that nothing had caused AAH to believe that the
prospectus
was misleading.  It should be said at once that I accept that AAH
did not believe that the prospectus was misleading, and as well
that AT held
the opinion that Section 1 of the prospectus satisfied the requirements of the
general law described in the AT sign-off
letter.  It will be recalled that
AAH's defence put its retainer in the words "had come to their attention which
caused them to believe",
words probably used because of the terms of the
sign-off letter, but when AAH had directed and been intimately involved in the
due
diligence process the sign-off letter conveyed AAH's opinion that the
prospectus was not misleading.  I accept that AAH held that
opinion also.  
<P>

<b>Board approvals of the proposals</b>
<P>

996	A meeting of the due diligence committee was held on 15 August 1994.  Mr
Mackay chaired the meeting.  Also present were Mr Kirby,
Dr Werner, Mr Willing,
Mr Morgan, Mr Bateman, Mr Wehby, Mr Barry, Mr Brad Rees, and Mr Hullah;  those
in attendance included Ms Godwin.
 
<P>

997	According to the minutes -
<P>

"The Chairman tabled a number of updated documents forming part of the Legal
Due Diligence Report those included:
<P>

1.	Letters of approval obtained from NAB.
<P>

2.	Senior Counsel's opinion confirming the manner in which shares in NRMA
Holdings Limited are to be paid up and the binding nature
of the resolutions of
the members of NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited.
<P>

3.	Opinion given as to application and proxy forms being on the same
document."
<P>

998	The Senior Counsel's opinion was Mr Heydon's opinion of 28 July 1994:  the
draft AT sign-off letter had foreshadowed that it
would be dealt with
separately.  
<P>

999	The other opinion was the AT letter of 15 August 1994.  The minutes also
recorded Mr Morgan stating that the verification process
was largely complete,
and it was resolved that the due diligence committee would meet on 18 August
1994 when "Final versions of all
opinions and reports would be tabled and
signed".  
<P>

1000	According to Mr Bateman, while the AT letter of 15 August 1994 was
formally tabled it was not circulated or otherwise referred
to during the
meeting.  Mr Kirby said in a witness statement that he read the opinion of Mr
Heydon and the AT letter of 15 August
1994 "at or about the time I received
them", and Mr Mackay said much the same.  These were formal repetitions in the
witness statements,
and I do not think they can be taken as evidence that the
AT letter of 15 August 1994 was read at the meeting.  But Mr Mackay and
Mr
Kirby were persons who took care to become familiar with relevant materials,
and I accept that they were aware of the letter and,
if not at the meeting,
read it following its tabling.  Mr Morgan, of course, was already familiar with
it.  It would be surprising
if the other members of the committee did not make
themselves aware of its substance at this time.
<P>

1001	The due diligence committee met again on 17 August 1994:  why another
meeting prior to 18 August 1994 was unclear.  Those present
and in attendance
included the persons mentioned for 15 August 1994;  Mr Adrian Rees was also
present.  
<P>

1002	The minutes included -
<P>

"<b>LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE REPORT:</b>
<P>

The Final Due Diligence Report, unsigned, was tabled and John Morgan went
through the report.  John Morgan asked if any person present
wanted to raise
any further issues.  No issues were raised.  John Morgan then explained to the
meeting what would take place at the
meeting of the Due Diligence Committee on
the morning of 18 August 1994.
<P>

John Morgan explained that at the next morning's meeting the following
documents would be tabled:
<P>

After a record of some discussion and reference to the completion of the
verification process, according to the minutes - 
<P>

"<b>LETTERS OF OPINION:</b>
<P>

Copies of letters of opinion from Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley and Abbott Tout
were tabled by the Chairman relating to matters referred
to previously."
<P>

Then after further matters, including noting the latest changes to the
prospectus - 
<P>

"<b>DUE DILIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT:</b>
<P>

The Chairman tabled the final version of the Due Diligence Committee Report
dated 18 August 1994 to be signed at Thursdays meeting."
<P>

1003	There was contention in the proceedings over the AT opinion letter said to
have been tabled.  According to the earlier part
of the minutes, there would
have been AAH letters "on the prospectus and the offers, stamp duty and
taxation of the NRMA Offer Trust".
 Concentrating on the prospectus and offers,
AAH had not yet provided its sign-off letter (the signed letter was dated 18
August
1994), but it was accepted that a copy of the sign-off letter was
tabled, and it must have been an unsigned copy in the then final
form.  Still
according to the earlier part of the minutes, there would have been an AT
letter or letters "on the notice of meeting
section of the prospectus".  The
signed AT sign-off letter was dated 17 August 1994.  The description in the
minutes was not very
accurate, but would apply more readily to the AT sign-off
letter of 17 August 1994 than to the AT letter concerning the onsert of
15
August 1994, and I think it was accepted that the reference in the minutes was
not to the letter of 15 August 1994.  The contention
was over whether the AT
sign-off letter was in truth tabled at the meeting.
<P>

1004	Mr Bateman gave evidence that he took the AT sign-off letter to the
meeting of 17 August 1994, that it was not called for,
that he did not provide
it or copies of it to anyone, and that he took it back to his office after the
meeting.  He said that the
minutes were incorrect in a number of respects,
including so far as they recorded the tabling of opinion letters, and the
contention
as to the meeting of 17 August 1994 was followed by contention as to
the meetings on 18 August 1994.  In the hearing, it seemed that
AT's position
was that its sign-off letter had never come to the actual notice of the members
of the due diligence committee and
the boards.
<P>

1005	I am satisfied that the AT sign-off letter was tabled at the meeting of
the due diligence committee on 17 August 1994.  Mr
Mackay was certain that it
was tabled, and that he received a copy, and he had a copy in his own papers.
Mr Adrian Rees gave positive
evidence of the tabling of the signed sign-off
letter, saying that he read it (and the copy of the AAH sign-off letter) at the
time
because he thought it critical.  Mr Gonzales, who was in attendance and
prepared the minutes, also asserted a positive recollection
of the tabling of
the signed sign-off letter, but his recollection was shown to be compromised
and I put it aside.  Nonetheless,
where the agenda included the AT opinion as a
discussion item (as it did), where the purpose of the meeting was to prepare
for the
formal events of the next day, and where the signed letter was
available, it is likely that it was indeed tabled.  Further, the minutes
were
distributed, and were not disputed or corrected at a later meeting;  on the
contrary, Mr Simpson suggested that the draft minutes
be amended to include
specific reference to tabling the opinion letters of AAH and AT, and Mr Simpson
said that they were tabled.
 The probabilities, the recollections of tabling,
and the acceptance of the minutes, in my view, outweigh Mr Bateman's evidence,
and I think his recollection was erroneous.
<P>

1006	The meetings programme for 18 August 1994 was a meeting of the due
diligence committee at 8.00 am, a meeting of the members
of Holdings at 9.00
am, a meeting of the board of Holdings at 9.05 am, a joint meeting of the
boards of Association and Insurance
at 10.00 am, and a reconvened meeting of
the board of Holdings at 12.00 noon.
<P>

1007	The due diligence committee met as anticipated.  Again Mr Mackay chaired
the meeting.  Present were all who had been present
on 17 August 1994, plus Mrs
Callaghan and Mr Jack;  Ms Godwin was amongst those in attendance.  
<P>

1008	The minutes of the meeting included -
<P>

"<b>LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE REPORT:</b>
<P>

The Chairman tabled the Final Legal Due Diligence Report and it was noted that
the ISC had not yet formally informed us of its approval,
however, NRMA has
received no indication whatsoever that the approval would not be
forthcoming.
<P>

John Morgan outlined that the prospectus stated that approval is expected,
which it is, and it was agreed to proceed on this basis.
<P>

John Morgan asked if any member of the Committee wished to raise any matter in
connection with the Due Diligence.  No matter was
raised and it was agreed that
all material issues had been dealt with adequately.
<P>

John Morgan signed the Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley Legal Due Diligence Report to
the Committee.
<P>

<b>VERIFICATION REPORT:</b>
<P>

John Morgan tabled the Verification Report from Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley which
was in the same form as that tabled at yesterday's
meeting.
<P>

The Verification Report was signed by John Morgan and presented to the
Committee.

<b>DUE DILIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT:</b>
<P>

IT WAS RESOLVED by the Committee that the Due Diligence Committee report be
adopted by the Committee and approved by the Committee
and that Don Mackay, the
Chairman of the Due Diligence Committee, be authorised to sign the report.
<P>

Don Mackay signed the report."
<P>

1009	The AAH sign-off letter was the first of the documents recorded as tabled.
It was dated 18 August 1994, and followed the draft
of 10 August 1994 with some
changes of no present relevance.  It, or a copy of it, was physically part of
the report of the due diligence
committee, in that the report had many
attachments as "exhibits" (for example the prospectus and the legal and
financial reports),
and the sign-off letter was exhibit G.  Mr Heydon's opinion
of 28 July 1994 was also physically part of the report of the due diligence
committee, being exhibit K.
<P>

1010	The minutes did not record the tabling of, or otherwise mention, the AT
sign-off letter.  According to Mr Bateman, he brought
the original AT sign-off
letter to the meeting and gave it to someone whose identity he could not
recall;  it was not referred to,
and if it was dealt with in any way it was
only as forming part of a large pile of documents on the table (and not removed
from the
pile).  Mr Morgan said at the meeting, referring to the pile of
documents, that he would take them back to AAH and "we'll do photocopies,
binding, and circulate a set to each member of the DDC".  Still according to Mr
Bateman, the bound documents he later received did
not include the AT sign-off
letter.  
<P>

1011	The AAH sign-off letter had not been signed as at 17 August 1994, so the
signed letter was tabled on 18 August 1994.  The signed
AT sign-off letter had
been tabled on 17 August 1994, so it was not tabled on 18 August 1994.  This
simple reasoning may explain
why the minutes did not record the tabling of the
AT sign-off letter on 18 August 1994.  Mr Bateman may have brought the original
signed letter to the meeting, perhaps because a copy of the signed letter
rather than the original had been physically tabled the
previous day, and there
were other recollections of him handing a letter over.  Mr Mackay thought he
was the person to whom Mr Bateman
gave the original letter, but I do not think
he was certain and in particular he may not have been certain as to the
occasion.  Mr
Mamutil recalled Mr Bateman handing a letter to Mr Simpson.  But
one would expect the minutes to refer to the letter if it was dealt
with in any
formal way, and there was no satisfactory evidence that it was.  That the AT
sign-off letter did not form part of the
bound-up set of due diligence
documents supports that it was not given mainstream attention at the
meeting.
<P>

1012	The absence of satisfactory evidence that the AT sign-off letter was dealt
with in a formal way had two particular aspects.
 One aspect was that a number
of those present who might have been expected to recollect attention to the
letter at the meeting gave
no evidence of it.  The other was that, while some
of those present asserted recollection of attention to the letter at the
meeting,
their evidence was in my view unreliable.  
<P>

1013	Dr Werner asserted a recollection of the sign-off letters being placed on
the table, even of reading them, but his evidence
of this and other matters was
very confused as to times, places and events.  Mr Kirby said that the AT letter
of 17 August 1994 was
tabled at the meeting, and that he read it at or about
the time of the meeting;  again, this was an expression which I doubt was
Mr
Kirby's own, and I am not prepared to treat what Mr Kirby said as an accurate
statement of true recollection.  Mr Jack said that
Ms Conway put papers on the
table and said "We have got the sign-off from Allens and Abbotts", and that he
considered that the due
diligence committee thereby received the sign-off
letters.  This can not be correct, as Ms Conway was not at the meeting.  Mrs
Callaghan
indirectly asserted receipt of the AT letter, saying that she would
not otherwise have voted to adopt the report of the due diligence
committee,
but I do not think this was the product of genuine recollection.  In my view
the stance of a number of the directors had
become that the responsibility for
what befell the NRMA must have been the responsibility of the lawyers, in Mrs
Callaghan's case
a concern to sheet that responsibility home, leading them to
unjustified present beliefs as to past specific knowledge of the sign-off
letters.  The preparation of common form or similar witness statements by the
NRMA's solicitors in these proceedings did nothing
to guard against this, and
that feature of the preparation of the proceedings should have been avoided.

<P>

1014	I accept that Mr Bateman brought the signed AT sign-off letter to the
meeting on 18 August 1994 and gave it to someone, but
I do not think it was
specifically referred to and it was not distributed or considered at the
meeting;  hence it was not minuted
as tabled.
<P>

1015	The members of Holdings then met.  They resolved to adopt new articles.
<P>

1016	The board of Holdings then met.  Present as the board were Mr Mackay, Mr
Kirby, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Jack and Mr Willing.  Those
in attendance included Mr
Corrigan, Mr Cox, Dr Werner, Mr Rees, Ms Conway, Mrs Storrs, Mr Morgan, and Mr
Bateman.  
<P>

1017	The minutes included -
<P>

"PROSPECTUS AND DUE DILIGENCE REPORTS:
<P>

"The prospectus together with a Due Diligence Report  and a Verification Report
from  Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley, a Due Diligence
Report from Coopers &amp;
Lybrand (Securities) Ltd and opinions from Messrs Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley and
Abbott Tout were tabled.
<P>

The directors noted the Due Diligence Reports and the documents and matters
referred to in them.
<P>

The directors also noted that the Verification Report contained confirmations
that statements contained in the Prospectus were materially
correct and that
there were no material omissions from those statements.
<P>

The directors were advised that the conclusion of the Due Diligence Committee
was that, based on the due diligence and verification
procedures which were
implemented and the results of those investigations, the Due Diligence
Committee believes that:
<P>

(a)	the Prospectus does not contain a material statement which is false or
misleading;
<P>

(b)	there are no material omissions from the Prospectus; and
<P>

(c)	the issue of the Prospectus and the proposed allotment of shares under the
Prospectus does not involve conduct that is misleading
or deceptive or likely
to mislead or deceive.
<P>

It was resolved that up to 1,090 million ordinary shares with a par value of
$1.00 each in the capital of the Company be offered
for subscription pursuant
to the Prospectus and that the Prospectus be approved and signed by each
director of the Company."
<P>

1018	The minutes later recorded the tabling of the prospectus, and resolutions
"that the Company proceed with the `Share the Future'
proposal" and that it be
recommended that members of Association and Insurance vote in favour.  After
the adjournment (the joint
meeting of the boards of Association and Insurance
intervened) the minutes again recorded a resolution that the directors sign the
prospectus:  there was other repetition, and reference in the minutes to
substituted materials which may explain the repetition of
the resolution to
sign the prospectus.  
<P>

1019	The description of the tabled reports was unclear:  was the "Due Diligence
Report" first mentioned the legal due diligence
report, as its linking with the
verification report and juxtaposition with the financial due diligence report
might suggest, and
if so what of the report of the due diligence committee?  It
is all but inconceivable that the report of the due diligence committee
was not
tabled, Mr Kirby included it amongst the documents he said were tabled, and the
minutes must be imperfect.  
<P>

1020	The imperfection of the minutes is material to the continued contention
over the tabling of the AT sign-off letter.  Although
the minutes recorded that
"opinions from Messrs Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley and Abbott Tout were tabled",
according to Mr Bateman the
AT sign-off letter was not tabled, circulated, or
referred to.  There was the customary confusion of evidence on the subject.

<P>

1021	Many of those present said nothing.  Some gave positive evidence of the
tabling of the letter.  Mr Mackay did so, saying that
he was familiar with it
because he had received a copy on 17 August 1994, and Mr Rees did so also.  On
the other hand, the documents
which Mr Kirby said were tabled included the AAH
sign-off letter but not the AT sign-off letter.  Mrs Callaghan and Mr Jack said
that they would not have voted in favour of the proposals if they had known the
letters were wrong, a less than clear assertion of
knowledge of the letters
which I do not think justifies a finding of knowledge of the AT sign-off
letter.  Of particular significance,
however, was that Mr Graeme Blackett, then
the joint secretary of the NRMA companies, gave evidence that the AT sign-off
letter was
tabled, and identified it in the board papers kept by the NRMA.  It
bore a notation in his writing, "tabled Holdings 18/8/94" in
accordance with
his practice of making such notations on tabled documents and filing them with
the board papers.  
<P>

1021	The probabilities favour the tabling of both sign-off letters.  The
probabilities, the evidence of Mr Mackay and Mr Rees, this
evidence of Mr
Blackett, and the prima facie weight of the minutes themselves, lead me to the
view that Mr Bateman's recollection
is at fault, and that the AT sign-off
letter was tabled at the meeting.
<P>

1022	Whatever may have been tabled, the minutes indicate that the documents
were not then gone through.  Rather, they were "noted",
and the meeting was
"advised" of the conclusion of the due diligence committee and acted on that
advising.  I do not think the repetition
by Mr Kirby and others of the stock
phrase that he or she read the documents at or about the time they received
them is satisfactory
evidence that the documents were read or gone through at
the meeting.  
<P>

1023	The boards of Association and Insurance then met jointly.  Present as the
board of Association were Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Ms
Booth, Mr
Burrows, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Douglass, Mr Farr-Jones,
Miss Fraser, Mr Jack, Dame Leonie Kramer, Mr Lawson,
Ms Ralph, Ms Singleton,
Mr Talbot, Dr Vanderfield, and
Dr Werner.  Ms Ralph was present by telephone from Perth.  Present as the
board of Insurance were
Mr Mackay, Mr Jack, Mr Burrows,
Mrs Callaghan, Mr Douglass, Mr Easson, Mr Farr-Jones,
Mr Kirby, Ms Singleton, Mr Corrigan, and Mr
Willing.  Those
in attendance included Ms Conway, Ms Godwin, and Mr Bateman.

<P>

1024	The minutes of the Association meeting included -
<P>

"<b>`SHARE THE FUTURE' PROPOSAL</b>
<P>

A draft  prospectus  for  the  offer of up to 1,090 million ordinary shares in
the capital of the Company was tabled (the `Prospectus'),
together with a press
release from the Treasurer. The Share the Future proposal was discussed.
<P>

A letter dated 29 June 1994 from Ms F J Singleton was noted.
<P>

The motion originally put by Mr G F Lawson on 30 June 1994 to the Board of NRMA
Limited and which had lain on the table until today's
meeting was discussed.
<P>

Mr Lawson moved that the motion be amended as follows:
<P>

`To enable members to be clearly informed about the issues to be put before
them re the `share the future project' that a direct
mail be made to all
members outlining the possible short, medium and long term drawbacks and that
newspaper notification be made
of the same.'
<P>

After considerable discussion Mr Lawson withdrew his amended motion.
<P>

The directors, having carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of
the proposal, and believing it is in the best interests
of the members and the
NRMA, and that the Free Shares are being allocated under the proposal in the
way the Board believes to be
fair, resolved that the company proceed with the
`Share the Future' proposal.
<P>

The motion was carried with a majority of 13 votes to 3.
<P>

Miss D Fraser, Mr RJ Talbot and Ms FJ Singleton requested that their
dissent be noted.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS:</b>
<P>

A twelve page document entitled `Information for Members', and Schedule of
Statements made by the directors of NRMA Holdings Limited
(to be relied upon by
the directors of such of NRMA Ltd and NRMA Insurance Ltd), were tabled and
minor typographical errors were
noted.
<P>

It was resolved that the `Information for Members' is adopted as a joint
statement made by the Boards of each of NRMA Ltd and NRMA
Insurance Ltd to be
supplied to members of each company.
<P>

Miss D Fraser, Mr RJ Talbot and Ms FJ Singleton requested that their dissent be
noted.
<P>

<b>RECOMMENDATION TO MEMBERS:</b>
<P>

It was  resolved  that  the directors of  the Company recommend to members of
the Company that:
<P>

(a)	members of NRMA Limited vote in favour of the proposal; and
<P>

(b)	members of NRMA Limited choose to take up the Free Shares.
<P>

Miss D Fraser, Ms FJ Singleton and Mr RJ Talbot requested that their dissent be
noted.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF MEETING AND INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS</b>:
<P>

It was resolved that:
<P>

(a)	approval is given for the inclusion in the prospectus to be issued by NRMA
Holdings Limited and Perpetual Trustee Company Limited
of the material in
Section 1 and for the Proxy Voting Papers to be on the outside of the
prospectus;
<P>

(b)	members of NRMA Limited be given Notice of General Meeting of the Company
and the Information for Members by means of:
<P>

(i)	publication in the Sydney Morning Herald on a date between 26 August 1994
and 9 September 1994;  and
<P>

(ii)	inclusion in the prospectus to be despatched by NRMA Holdings Limited."
<P>

1025	Other business in connection with the proposal was also transacted, with a
view to the calling and conduct of the relevant
meetings and otherwise.
<P>

1026	The minutes of the Insurance meeting reflected the minutes of the
Association meeting.  The resolution to proceed with the
proposal was carried
with a majority of ten votes to one.  Ms Singleton's dissent was noted, and Ms
Singleton's dissent to the subsequent
resolutions was again noted.
<P>

1027	Neither of the minutes said anything of tabling, or indeed referred to,
the report of the due diligence committee or any of
the due diligence
materials.  In particular, they said nothing of the sign-off letters.  It may
be that the view was taken that the
due diligence process should be formally
reflected in the business of Holdings alone, treating Holdings alone of the
issuer of the
prospectus:  this may have been an incorrect approach, but
nonetheless one which was adopted.  Whatever the position, it was not
suggested
in these proceedings that the sign-off letters were placed before the joint
meeting, or at least to the extent that anyone
so suggested I do not think they
were correct.  
<P>

1028	That the sign-off letters were not placed before the joint meeting does
not mean that they were not mentioned in the course
of the meeting.  Nor is the
fact that the minutes do not refer to them inconsistent with some mention, the
minutes being only a minutes.
 The so-called non-verbatim transcript to which I
next come indicates the extent of discussion not reflected in the minutes.  The
transcript was directed to disadvantages and to the AT letter of 15 August
1994, the response to Ms Singleton's query, and I will
go to it before
returning to the sign-off letters.
<P>

1029	The minutes did refer to disadvantages so far as they recorded the raising
and fate of Mr Lawson's motion.  They did not say
anything of Ms Singleton's
query or the AT letter of 15 August 1994.  The evidence included a document
described as <i>"not a verbatim transcript but a summary of notes taken at"</i>
the joint meeting, the author being Mrs Storrs.  It was a compilation from Mrs
Storr's own notes of the meeting and the notes Mr
Blackett and a Ms Meredith
Richer, and its accuracy in substance was not in doubt.  
<P>

1030	It is not easy to summarise the transcript, and its importance calls for
setting out the material parts.  The parts specifically
dealing with the AT
letter of 15 August 1994 are underlined.
<P>

1031	Shortly after Mr Mackay moved and Mr Burrows seconded a resolution to
approve the proposal, and following expressions of support
and reasons for
support by some of the directors, Ms Singleton said that she wished "to vote on
item 5 re the `no' case before item
4 because my feelings on 5 are contingent
on 4".  This referred to agenda items, item 4 being approval of the proposal
and item 5
being Mr Lawson's motion of 30 June 1994 still lying on the table.

<P>

1032	Mr Mackay ruled that the agenda order be followed.  Thereafter, according
to the transcript -
<P>

	"<b>Geoff Lawson</b>	I make a motion to amend the original motion of
30 June. I think that there are disadvantages in this proposal although I
may still
approve it if I know that the no case can be put. I think resolution
5 and 4 interlink. I'd like to also thank the management and
staff for all
their work.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	I may decide to take the resolutions together if this would
affect your decision.
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	Now you're willing to change your mind.
<P>

	<b>Michael Easson</b>	We've heard the objections in principle to the
proposition and I'm thinking that it may be coloured by the position on
resolution
5. However, is there any other philosophical points we need to raise
outside the no case argument.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	Well I'm against it, I don't like the way its been
handled behind the backs of the directors. It should be condemned by the board
and the members. We'll be stampeding the members with a prospectus and voting
form. It should have been couched by way of plebiscite
of the members with a
mail out asking how they feel and giving them the for and against case. We
would have saved money and then
if they wanted to go ahead we could have given
them the prospectus.
<P>

	<b>Dawn Fraser</b>	I haven't had an opportunity to read the prospectus.  Every
time I look at it I get a new one.  I think that this has been railroaded
through.  The prospectus asks for the full name and addresses on the proxy
forms but my name and address is missed out on the voting
form.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	You've had the prospectus since 14 July.  There are always
amendments in proposals of this kind but we're only asking you to approve
section 1.
<P>

	<b>Dawn Fraser</b>	My name is missing from the forms.
<P>

	<b>Greg Bateman</b>	The proxy forms require the person appointing the proxy to
verify that the person is a member of association.  It's the opposite
case in
Insurance but it is standard practice to identify the person so they do this by
name and address.
<P>

	<b>Dawn Fraser</b>	My apologies.  I see the boxes for my membership number.
<P>

<b>	Don Mackay</b> 	I propose that we have further discussion on resolution 5.
I propose that we discuss 5 at the same time as 4.
<P>

	<b>Mark Burrows	</b>I just like to clarify what Richard Talbot said. There is
no reason given why we shouldn't de mutualise, only the way we have attempted
the look at the process to date. What reasons  have you against de
mutualisation?
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	De mutualisation is something many companies are trying
to do. Your question is impossible to answer. There are streams of de
mutualisation
I have concerns with.
<P>

	<b>Dame Leonie</b>	Do  you  object  to  the  members  of this 
<P>

<b>	Kramer	</b>organisation being offered shares or cash?
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	Personally I would like it to remain a mutual.
<P>

	<b>Dame Leonie	</b>This is not  an answer  to my question  because if
<P>

	<b>Kramer	</b>you are against it then the members should know your
position.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	I'm against the way it was handled and the way its going
to be listed on the ASX. This is going to come under the hands of large
institutions and rivals.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	The members will decide this.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot	</b>They should be told it is major concern.
<P>

	<b>Ray Willing</b>	But what is the concern?
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	Whether it be sooner or later the control of the NRMA
will go into the hands of large institutional investors.
<P>

	<b>Lynn Ralph</b>	Those institutional investors, aren't they managing the
funds of  individual? Superannuees and retirees?
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	It would be a dereliction of my duty [not?] to give the
members the option to choose at this time to unlock the wealth or let it
remain
as it is.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	But who is it going to be unlocked for?
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	The members.
<P>

	<b>Ray Willing</b>	The cost base for tax is only for members not for others
coming in after.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	There's now 2 classes of members - one with no voting
rights.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	It has to be decided by members. If they're against it then
they will all revert back to being members as usual.
<P>

	<b>Michael Easson</b>	Do you oppose the de mutualisation completely?
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	Of NRMA only.
<P>

	<b>Michael Easson</b>	<u>There's still Jane's concerns over the prospectus.
Have they been clarified?</u>
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	<u>The information I have specifically sought has not
been given.  I think that the referral to the proxy form and the acceptance
form
on the front of the onsert forms can be misconstrued.   I was told that
there was advice but not written.</u>
<P>

	<b>Helen Conway</b>	<u>We wanted to give you the advice on the final format.
I now table it.</u>
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b> 	Maybe you can tell us what concerns you have with the
prospectus Jane.
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	Page 3 of the edition I received the night before last
line 8. Is it a member or does it mean shareholder?
<P>

			The reference to `financial ownership formalises' is a bit too clever.
<P>

			There is an implication if they vote `no' they don't get shares. This should
be made clearer.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	The acceptance form clearly tells them the position
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	I'm dealing with the prospectus. This implication
appears on page 6. It also refers on page 13 to the tax position depending on a
favourable outcome from Federal government. There is no way we can assure them
that the legislation will be passed. Page 14, I don't
like the reference to
NRMA culture it is a loose term I prefer to address the issue as to structure
of services.
<P>

	<b>Prue Godwin</b>	But this is the way that the questions came to us.
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	Culture can mean anything you want. It should be changed
to service structure. If the members have to decide it should be as close
to a
referendum as possible. The prospectus is not down the middle.
<P>

	<b>Lynn Ralph</b>	This is not a referendum, we are not a government.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	I'll recapitulate on what has been done to get the
information to the public to date. There was a special dispensation from the
ASC
so the issues could be debated in public. GIO and Woolworths didn't do
this.
<P>

			On 17 March there was a decision to consider the proposal. The issues were
dealt with in the Media and The Open Road and concerns
were raised by NRMA
itself such as going to the ASX for take over protection and looking at the tax
issues and the service culture.
This was dealt with in 2 issues of The Open
Road and also dealt with when a document was sent to the members in June
(yellow explanatory
pamphlet). The board was given a prospectus a month ago.
There were no substantial changes only tidying up issues.
<P>

			In this month's Open Road the no case has been specified in a very good
manner. It is heavily weighted in raising issues of concern
to members.
<P>

	<b>Gordon Douglass</b>	I agree.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	There will be a double page spread in the Sydney Morning
Herald to include section 1 of the prospectus together with the Notice of
Meeting. This will provide the public with even more information. To date there
has been no case specified by you. There's only the
no case given by Ms Tolz as
raised on the Andrew Olle show. Do you want to proceed with your motion?
<P>

	<b>Jane Singleton</b>	It's up to Geoff. He has some amendments.
<P>

	<b>Geoff Lawson</b>	I have some amendments that I'd like to make to the motion
I've put. I amend the motion to read `To enable members to be clearly
informed
about the issues to be put before them re the "share the future project" that a
direct mail be made to all members to outline
the possible short, medium and
long term drawbacks and newspaper notification be made of the same.'
<P>

	<b>Mark Burrows</b>	I want you to understand that there is a criminal sanction
involved here in signing if the companies mislead the public about their
prospectus. The `yes' case has been a proper balanced statement of the
companies' prospects.
<P>

			The Due Diligence Committee was formed to look not only at the financial
position but what is to be said to the members. All
documents that have gone
out have done so with the sanction of the ASC. In relation to the potential
drawback in the future you simply
can't predict too far into the future, its
impossible.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	Look at The Open Road. We have got 5 years dispensation to
give us time to stabilise. We are also putting section 1 of the prospectus
in
the Sydney Morning Herald and there has been a supplement in The Open Road on
the no case. The only no cases that I'm aware of,
such as the potential for
takeover, and a possible rise in premiums, well these issues have been dealt
with, no new points have been
raised which haven't been looked at in the above
publication.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	And no other letters have been received?
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	No letter that hasn't already raised issues dealt with by
The Open Road or by section 1 of the prospectus.
<P>

	<b>Ray Willing</b>	Nothing we haven't addressed.
<P>

	<b>Mark Burrows</b>	Section 1 does deal with the concerns.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot	</b>I could sit down with you Mr Chairman and any other
fellow directors and members of NRMA to help develop a no case for mailing
out.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	What other issues that haven't already been canvassed are
there?
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	Don't you think it's important enough?
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	They've all been canvassed.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	What is the cost of sending out the prospectus?
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	A lot.
<P>

	<b>Richard Talbot</b>	Why not send a mail out? What is the hurry to get
everything done so soon?
<P>

	<b>Dame Leonie 	</b>So  we  don't listen  to any more ludicrous 
<P>

<b>	Kramer		</b>arguments from you.
<P>

	<b>Ray Kirby</b>		This has to be done quickly. We are in a changing legal and
commercial environment. We've got to go through a window of opportunity.
If we
don't do this now tax or ASC rules will change. People have been working 7 days
a week to get through this time slot.
<P>

	<b>Ray Willing</b>	It's been in the media since 17 March. Its been a
drawn out event. If we draw it out any further there'll be even more exposure
concerning
the accounts and due diligence. The organisation morale will go
down, staff and members can't be strung out on this issue any more.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	Section 1 contains an examination of all issues and will be
mailed out to all members and published in the Sydney Morning Herald.
<P>

	<b>Michael Easson</b>	I don't accept logically that for every good argument
there is an equally bad argument. The members of the board have been sent
variations
from the original proposal on 17 March. There are various classes of
persons entitled. We've canvassed views of members and we've
addressed
questions such as tax. Some directors like to think that the proposition was
already decided but it actually was up in
the air more than the directors are
suggesting. Everything was dependent on the proper response from regulatory
authorities. I am
personally convinced that what we're doing is the right
thing. It was not a clear cut thing that the proposal would go through. I
feel
I would be morally compromised if I hadn't canvassed all issues to the members,
but to give to the members a totally fallacious
argument which could be the no
case would be a breach of my duty. I feel that a genuine attempt has been made
to answer all the points
raised.
<P>

	<b>Gordon Douglass	</b><u>I think Jane should be given time to read through
Abbott Tout's advice on the voting form.</u>
<P>

	<b>Geoff Lawson	</b>Given that section 1 is going to go in the Sydney Morning
Herald and the Open Road has been mailed out I withdraw the motion.
<P>

<b>	Michael Easson</b>	<u>The other factual matter was that some advice on the
front cover was to be obtained concerning the words `How many shares you may
be
given.' Whether it is misleading I would be interested to hear the
arguments.</u>
<P>

	<b>Ray Willing</b>	<u>The wording is different from when the issue was first
raised.</u>
<P>

	<b>Helen Conway</b>	<u>There have been many iterations [sic]. The advice from
external consultants was obtained when we finalised the wording. We got Abbott
Tout's advice on the formulation and there is no legal problem. This has been
approved by the ASC. (Greg Bateman's advice tabled)</u>
<P>

	<b>Doug Pearce</b>	I'd just like to say a bit more on why the prospectus has
to be done quickly.  Financial information is drawn at a point in time,
if we
go past that point the forecasts become actuals and have to be redone.
Logistically it is impossible to have a prospectus in
a longer time frame.  Its
just not a matter of updating things.  We have to start from scratch, and due
diligence process needs to
start again.  This happened with MMI who went
through the process 3 times.
<P>

	<b>Don Mackay</b>	Are there any other issues which anyone would like to raise?
In that case I put to the Board the resolution that the Company will
proceed
with the Share proposal."  [Underlining added]
<P>

1033	Mr Bateman gave evidence of what was said at the meeting, broadly along
the same lines as the transcript, but he was going
from recollection and I
think the transcript is a more reliable source.  According to Mr Bateman, when
Ms Singleton asked about advice
on the proxy form (the first underlining) she
was given the AT letter of 15 August 1994.  Ms Singleton read the letter, made
no comment
on it, and did not pass it on.  Mr Bateman's evidence did not extend
to the apparent second occasion on which AT advice concerning
the onsert was
tabled (the second underlining). 
<P>

1034	From the transcript the following appears.  
<P>

1035	First, there was debate over disadvantages and a "no" case, and in the end
Mr Lawson withdrew his motion of 30 June 1994. 
The majority were of the view
that Section 1 of the prospectus presented a balanced case, quite apart from
the coverage of the proposal
in The Open Road and otherwise in the media;
indeed, Mr Lawson seemed to come to be of that view.  Ms Fraser did not seem to
have
the familiarity with the proposal which might have been expected by 18
August 1994;  Ms Singleton's concerns were stated, were in
part little more
than drafting, but included that the prospectus was "not down the middle";  Mr
Talbot's concerns were in part as
to the handling of the proposal;  the only
enunciated disadvantages were that the NRMA would fall into the hands of large
institutional
investors and possibly to do with taxation and the NRMA culture.
There was hardly an illuminating critique from the opponents of
the proposal of
the balance of the prospectus.  
<P>

1036	Secondly, there was reference by Mr Burrows to the due diligence
committee, but no more explicit reference to its report or
to the due diligence
materials.  Implicit in what was said, however, was that the members of the
boards knew of the due diligence
process, and of course some of them had been
on the due diligence committee or at the meeting of Holdings' board.
<P>

1037	Thirdly, Mr Easson specifically adverted to Ms Singleton's query (the
first underlining).  He referred to her "concerns over
the prospectus", but
there was nothing to suggest concerns going beyond the original query, which Ms
Singleton then repeated in part,
and the concerns were in fact over the onsert.
The response was by tabling "the advice in final format", and there is no doubt
that
the AT letter of 15 August 1994 was provided at least to Ms Singleton.  Ms
Singleton said that the information she had "specifically
sought" had not been
given.  The transcript may not properly have captured what she said, as the
proxy form and the acceptance form
were not referred to on the front of the
onsert.  Possibly she had in mind that the letter did not in terms speak of
misconstruction.
 More likely she had in mind what had been framed as question
2 in the original letter to Mr Heydon, the question to do with the
combination
of phrases on the first page of the onsert, because question 1 had been
specifically answered but question 2 had not
- as described above, the changes
to the onsert meant that the specific question 2 question went away, and
instead the AT letter
now spoke of the general acceptability of the onsert.
Possibly Ms Singleton could not clearly remember what her concerns were, and
ran them together.  Having received the AT letter, Ms Singleton did not press
the point. 
<P>

1038	Fourthly, a little later Mr Easson referred to "advice on the front cover"
(the second underlining), whether the words "How
many shares you may be given"
were misleading.  Mr Easson, I think, had in mind something different from Ms
Singleton's query.  I
think he had in mind the separate but related query which
he had raised, whether the conjunction of words on the first page of the
onsert
"might have been leading members to the conclusion that they were getting
something no matter what, no matter how they voted".
 The words "How many
shares you may be given" were not the words which had provoked the earlier
queries, and there was nothing in
the evidence to indicate a particular concern
as to the new form of words on the first page of the onsert.  I think it likely
that
Mr Easson referred to these words because they were the words on the
latest version of the onsert and so in his mind, not realising
that the wording
had changed from the wording at the time of the earlier queries, and Mr Willing
immediately pointed out that the
wording had changed.  Mr Easson's own concern
was answered with the same AT letter of 15 August 1994, and it is to be noted
that
the answer lay not in what AT said about the original question 1 asked of
Mr Heydon but in what AT said about the general acceptability
of the onsert.
That Mr Easson had his own concern explains the second provision of the letter.
According to Mr Easson, he read the
AT letter at the meeting and regarded it as
satisfying his concern.  
<P>

1039	In the light of the transcript, I accept that when the AT letter of 15
August 1994 was given to Ms Singleton she read it, made
no comment on it, and
did not pass it on.  That is why it was again provided as the answer to Mr
Easson's query.  But I also accept
that it was tabled at the later time.  Mr
Easson said that it was tabled.  Ms Conway was certain that it was tabled.  Mr
Blackett
said that it was tabled, and identified it in the board papers.  Mrs
Storrs gave evidence of the letter in the board papers for the
meeting, with Mr
Blackett's notation that it was tabled at the meeting, and of a copy of the
same letter in the board papers with
her notation that it was tabled at the
meeting.  
<P>

1040	That does not mean that everyone at the meeting read the AT letter of 15
August 1994 at the time.  They were told by Ms Conway
of its effect, and what
she said would have conveyed at least that the wording on the front page of the
onsert was legally acceptable.
 To those who knew of the free shares problem
and the changes to the onsert it had provoked, it would also have conveyed that
the
wording of the onsert generally was legally acceptable, as the letter in
fact said.
<P>

1041	To return then to the sign-off letters, given that the members of the
boards knew of the due diligence process it would not
be surprising if there
was some discussion of the report of the due diligence committee or of the
sign-off letters in the course
of the meeting.  Had that been so, however, I
would have expected more explicit evidence of the discussion.  The transcript
did not
include such a discussion.  Two of the directors, Mr Burrows and Mr
Lawson, did give evidence of reference to the sign-off letters,
but I do not
consider their evidence reliable.  
<P>

1042	Mr Burrows said that it was reported to the boards that AAH and AT had
each given sign-off letters to the due diligence committee,
and that no one
said there was any outstanding concern of a legal nature.  He also said that it
was reported to the meeting that
a document had been received "that was
unconditional in terms of its legality and sign-off for going forward on the
project", but
he could not say who reported that matter.  Mr Burrows'
recollection was not good, and he exhibited in his evidence a tendency to
exclude any responsibilities on his own part and increase the responsibilities
of the NRMA's advisers.  I consider that the less
explicit reference to the due
diligence process found in the transcript has been magnified in his mind.
<P>

1043	Mr Lawson gave evidence to the effect that it was clear at the meeting
that the legal advice was that the prospectus was adequate,
with some reference
to sign-offs.  On one view this amounted to evidence that the sign-off letters
were specifically referred to.
 Mr Lawson was not a satisfactory witness, and
in my estimation was concerned to justify the withdrawal of his motion on
grounds
which included that he relied on legal advice that there was no problem
with the prospectus.  That is not consistent with what  appears
from the
transcript.  I do not accept that Mr Lawson was moved in that manner, and so
far as Mr Lawson's evidence was of seeing the
sign-off letters at the meeting
or being told specifically of the sign-off letters (and in the end the extent
to which he did say
this was not clear) I do not accept it.  
<P>

1044	In my view, therefore, not only were neither the report of the due
diligence committee nor the sign-off letters placed before
the joint meeting of
the boards of Association and Insurance, but there was no reference to those
documents beyond a general reference
to the due diligence committee;  but there
was the specific reference to the AT letter of 15 August 1994 revealed in the
transcript.
 Of course, a number of the directors would have had knowledge of
the report of the due diligence committee and the sign-off letters
from their
presence at the earlier meetings of the due diligence committee, and all would
no doubt have been aware that there had
been a due diligence process.
<P>

<b>Events to the decision of Gummow J</b>
<P>

1045	The NRMA began to post out the package containing the prospectus and the
onsert at about the beginning of September 1994. 
It also published the text of
the prospectus in newspapers and promoted the proposal through the media.  The
promotion of the proposal
through the media included newspaper advertisements
published on 4 and 11 September 1994.  Two reactions should be noted;
they may
possibly be relevant to these proceedings.  
<P>

1046	The first reaction is that of the TPC.  Letters dated 14 September 1994
from the Australian Government Solicitor to each of
Holdings, Association and
Insurance conveyed the TPC's view that the advertisements contravened
ss 52 and 53(g) of the TP Act.  
<P>

1047	The principal concern was that the advertisements suggested that members
had to vote in favour of the proposal to get any benefit,
whether shares or
cash:  it was said -
<P>

"The advertisements appear to be designed in our opinion to induce members of
the NRMA to form the belief that if they do not individually
vote in favour of
the restructuring proposal they will obtain no benefits at all from the
restructuring if it is approved."
<P>

Ms Singleton's query was given some force, although in relation to the
advertisements rather than the onsert.  
<P>

1048	Of more present relevance, the letters also expressed a subsidiary concern
that the advertisements contravened the TP Act-
<P>

"... by describing the shares as `Free Shares'. The shares which members will
receive if they do vote in favour of the proposed
changes in sufficient numbers
will not be free in the sense that they will not have to be paid for by them in
money or money's worth.
If members choose to accept the shares, they must
forego payment to themselves of the cash alternative. For this reason, the
shares
cannot truly be described as `free'."
<P>

This, of course, also addressed the advertisements rather than the prospectus,
but it presented a new perception of a free shares
problem - not that the
shares were not free because they were in exchange for membership, but that the
shares were not free because
they were an alternative to the cash.  The
corrective advertising and other action sought by the TPC was directed to the
principal
concern, and would have left the subsidiary concern untouched save so
far as there was to be included, "You can choose free shares
or the cash
alternative".
<P>

1049	Mr Morgan replied to the Australian Government Solicitor on behalf of
the NRMA by a letter dated 14 September 1994.  As to
the principal
concern, he took issue at some length with the TPC's view.  As to free shares,
he said quite shortly, "It is our view
that the shares are free as they will
not have to be paid for. In no sense can it be said that the net proceeds of
the sale of shares
are given up in consideration of the free shares. You
misunderstand the nature of the cash alternative as outlined above."  It was
nonetheless said that further advertisements would be placed to address the
TPC's concerns.  
<P>

1050	Ms Conway also wrote to the Australian Government Solicitor on
15 September 1994, expressing strong disagreement with the TPC's
view and
saying that the NRMA had legal advice which supported its view, namely the
letter from Mr Morgan of 14 September.  Over
the next few days there was
agreement on further advertising to meet the TPC's principal concern, none of
which detracted from describing
the shares as free shares.
<P>

1051	The second reaction is that of Mr Aleco Vrisakis.  Mr Vrisakis, a
solicitor, wrote to Ms Conway on 15 September 1994, stating
that he did so as a
concerned member of the NRMA.  His concerns included that the advertisements
had not fully and fairly told members
what their choices were but rather had
been designed to convey the message that it was necessary to vote in favour of
the proposal
in order to get free shares, and that there had not been
sufficient disclosure in the prospectus by way of identification and
explanation
of the disadvantages said to have been considered by the NRMA
boards and the reasons for their conclusion that the advantages outweighed
the
disadvantages.  Mr Vrisakis' concerns did not include that the description of
the shares as free shares was misleading.
<P>

1052	Ms Conway replied to Mr Vrisakis on 19 September 1994.  Her
reply was drafted by Mr Bateman.  As to the advertisements, she
said that the
NRMA did not accept <i>"the thrust of your comments"</i>, but referred to the
corrective advertising.  As to the prospectus, she said -
<P>

"As you can appreciate, a proposal like this is considered over some time. One
disadvantage of it was thought to be the matter of
takeovers. For that reason
the NRMA sought additional protection (beyond the second and third forms
identified on page 15 of the
prospectus) in the form of the 5% share
entitlement limit. This lasts until 1 January 2000. This, as you know, is
covered on pages
15, 86 and 87 of the prospectus.
<P>

Another disadvantage of it was thought to be the impact on the tax position of
members. Again, the NRMA sought to address that matter.
Pages 13 and 14 note
that a favourable outcome for members was negotiated with the Australian
Treasurer.
<P>

A relatively small number of pensioners (already close to the cut off points)
would face unintended consequences. This is noted
on page 16 of the
prospectus.
<P>

The major additional cost of being a listed company, being the cost of
maintaining a share register, is noted on page 10 of the
prospectus.
<P>

Beyond those matters referred to above, the NRMA Boards did not consider there
were any other material disadvantages of the proposal."
<P>

After dealing with certain other matters raised by Mr Vrisakis,
Ms Conway said that the NRMA was satisfied that members were fully
and
fairly informed. 
<P>

1053	Mr Vrisakis responded on 20 September 1994.  I do not think it
necessary to indicate what he said about the advertisements.
 As to the
prospectus, he said only -
<P>

"I note your statement that beyond the matters referred to in your letter the
NRMA Boards did not consider there were any other
material disadvantages of the
proposal. However, that is not what the prospectus tells members. The
prospectus does not acknowledge
that those matters were considered by the NRMA
Boards to be disadvantages, rather, they are dealt with as `Members'
Questions'."
<P>

1054	The reply of 21 September 1994 from Ms Conway, also drafted by
Mr Bateman, said in relation to the prospectus -
<P>

"As to your comments concerning the disadvantages of the proposal that were
considered, we fail to see how any fair reader could
fail to understand, first,
that each of the matters we have referred to had not [sic] been considered and,
second, that through the
efforts of the NRMA, they had been largely overcome.
In the circumstances, we find no substance in what you are putting to us.
<P>

Indeed, your comments seem to fall foul of the `nitpicking' of which Mr Justice
Young warned in <i>Devereaux Holdings Pty Limited v Pelsart Resources NL (No
2)</i> (1985), one of the key court cases in this area."
<P>

1055	The exchange ended with a letter from Mr Vrisakis to Ms Conway
dated 22 September 1994, so far as presently material stating
that "your
reference to `nitpicking' is consistent with the approach taken by the Board as
to making disclosure to members, including,
as I understand it, a refusal on
the part of the Board to present a `no case' to members,"
<P>

1056	The relevance of these reactions to the proceedings explaining the
parties' attention to them, seemed to be as follows.  
<P>

1057	First, the submissions for the defendants, or some of them, included that
the absence of complaint from regulatory authorities
and others that the
description of the shares as free shares was misleading was at least some
indication that the decisions of Gummow
J and the Full Court in the Federal
Court proceedings were unexpected coups for the applicants, and that the
decisions did not truly
suggest neglectful exposure of the NRMA to the free
shares question.  The submissions concentrated more on the ASC, and on relief
from any liability which might be found, but absence of complaint on the free
shares question as found against the NRMA in the Federal
Court proceedings from
the TPC as a regulatory authority, and from Mr Vrisakis as a concerned and
knowledgeable member was part of
them. 
<P>

1058	Secondly, the correspondence with Mr Vrisakis brought the firm statement
from the NRMA that the boards did not consider there
were material
disadvantages other than those with which the prospectus dealt, and was
satisfied that members were fully and fairly
informed.  
<P>

1059	Thirdly, the submissions of the defendants, or some of them, also included
that the NRMA's prompt rejection of this extra-curial
discontent with the
proposal provided some support for the position mentioned much earlier in these
reasons, that the majority of
the board was so intent on implementing the
proposal that Gambotto advice would not have brought its suspension until the
decision
of the High Court was known.  
<P>

1060	Fourthly, there was a dispute over quantum involving the cost of the
newspaper advertisements and the corrective advertising.
 I will explain it
later in these reasons.  
<P>

1061	I consider regard to the reactions and the dealings with the TPC and Mr
Vrisakis to be of marginal assistance at best in deciding
these proceedings;
while noting them, I go to the events directly leading to the Federal Court
proceedings.
<P>

1062	In the same period of early September 1994 Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser
were taking their own action.  On their behalf a brief
to advise was delivered
to Mr John Garnsey QC and Mr Brian Camilleri, who provided an
opinion dated 19 September 1994.  
<P>

1063	Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the opinion read -
<P>

"8.	We are asked to advise whether, in the light of the contents of the
Prospectus and in the light of certain matters as to which
we have been
instructed in connection with the Prospectus, the Prospectus and the notices of
general meetings which it contains properly
comply with the law relating to the
issue and contents of such documents.
<P>

	<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

9.	In our opinion the Prospectus and the notices of general meeting do not
properly comply with the law relating to the issue and
contents of such
documents. The Prospectus and notices should contain or be accompanied by
information
<P>

(a)	adequate to enable members of the Association and of NRMA Insurance
respectively to decide whether they should attend the meetings
or complete
proxy forms and vote on the proposed reconstruction, and
<P>

(b)	adequate to inform members fully and fairly and to instruct the members of
the Association and of NRMA Insurance as to their
respective rights, both in
relation to retaining the existing structure of the NRMA Group and as to the
different interests of members
of the Association who are not policy holders of
NRMA Insurance and of Association members who are also policy holders and
members
of NRMA Insurance.
<P>

	In our opinion, the Prospectus does not contain and, on our instructions, is
not accompanied by such information."
<P>

1064	The reasons for the conclusion at which Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri
arrived were expressed in paras 13 to 19 of the opinion.
 It is instructive to
compare them with the reasons in due course given by Gummow J and the Full
Court.
<P>

	 "13.	A perusal of the Prospectus reveals the following:
<P>

13.1	Members of the Association and NRMA Insurance are informed without
discrimination that they will receive, as the primary benefit
of the proposal,
`Free Shares' (eg pages 6, 7 9 and 28). Each member of the Association is
entitled to a minimum of 250 shares (with
additional loading for length of
membership) and each member who is a policy holder of NRMA Insurance (no matter
how many policies
of insurance that member holds, or for what period he has
held them) is entitled to a further 250 shares. The members who are entitled
to
the shares are those persons who were members of the Association and of NRMA
Insurance prior to and as at 16 March 1994. We are
instructed that since that
date, approximately a further 80,000 persons have become members, who, for
reasons not immediately apparent,
are not to have voting rights at the proposed
general meetings. New articles of association for the Association and for NRMA
Insurance
are to be adopted, `the central element of which means' that members
of the Association and NRMA Insurance agreed to give up their
membership on
condition that free shares are offered by NRMA Holdings (page 12).
<P>

13.2	In the financial information in the Prospectus there is a consolidated
balance sheet as at 31 March 1994 for the NRMA Group
(page 65) with
consolidated profit and loss accounts (page 64). At note 8 under `Investments'
the investments of the Insurance Group,
current and non current, amount to more
than $3.8 billion and the investments of the Association Group amount to $312.1
million dollars
(page 74).
<P>

13.3	The explanation for the proposed share allocation in the prospectus is in
the following terms:
<P>

	`For a NRMA Insurance policy holder to be eligible to have become a member of
NRMA Insurance, the policy holder must have been
a member of the Association.
Members of the Association are, therefore, being offered an automatic
entitlement to Free Shares, with
an additional allocation if that membership
was linked to an NRMA Policy other than Life or Travel. For these reasons the
board consider
that members of NRMA Insurance have interests similar to those
of members of the Association.'
<P>

13.4	Members of the Association and of NRMA Insurance are told that if they do
not accept the `Free Shares' by completing the Free
Shares Form they will
automatically receive the cash alternative, which is the amount realised on
sale of the shares of NRMA Holdings
once the transaction price is established
(pages 8, 10, 14, 22 23 and 28).
<P>

13.5	Additional subscriptions attached to one membership of the Association,
and multiple policies of insurance do not entitle the
members and holders
concerned to more than one allocation of `Free Shares'. It is said that this
decision was made because 85 per
cent of all members have only one subscription
(one car covered by their membership of the Association) and `it was thought
fair
to reward loyalty by taking account of the length of membership. This also
recognises that long-standing members tend to have more
business with the NRMA'
(page 9). It was evidently considered unfair to deal with members who were also
policy holders of and members
of NRMA Insurance on the basis of the far greater
proportion of assets of the NRMA Group held by that company or its
subsidiaries,
or the number and duration of policies held by the one member. No
explanation is given as to why members of NRMA Insurance who have
more than one
policy, and why the additional value of the premiums contributed by them, and
the size of premiums, should not give
a greater entitlement to the `Free
Shares'.
<P>

14	The information provided in the Prospectus, while it deals at length with
the new structure proposed after the reconstruction
(eg page 7), does not deal
<u>at all</u> with the following matters:
<P>

14.1	The present `mutual nature' of the Association and of NRMA Insurance, as
companies limited by guarantee, and the rights of
members of the Association
and of NRMA Insurance as separate members of each of those companies with
separate voting rights.
<P>

14.2	The benefits of the present status of the Association and of NRMA
Insurance to the existing operations and profitability of
the Association and
of NRMA Insurance.
<P>

14.3	The effect, after restructuring, of a liability or obligation to pay
appropriate dividends from profits to shareholders upon
the maintenance of
existing services, the provision of future services and benefits and business
operations and expansion generally.
The statements in relation to the financial
effect of the change in status which is proposed in the Prospectus is extremely
general
(pages 14-15).
<P>

14.4	The ability of the member policy owners of NRMA Insurance to resolve
<u>separately</u> that the company be converted from a company limited by
guarantee to a company limited by share capital, and to exploit that change
in
status themselves by reference to the assets of NRMA Insurance and that
company's subsidiaries (the Insurance Group). The consolidated
balance sheet
(pages 57, 65) does not disclose the separate net worth of `Members' Equity' of
the Association and of NRMA Insurance
respectively. The note concerning
investments (note 8 page 74) would suggest, as we have said, that the
difference would be substantial
(NRMA Insurance and its subsidiaries have
investments which are worth approximately ten times as those of the Association
and its
subsidiaries).
<P>

14.[sic]The matters to which we have referred above are, in our opinion,
information which must be known to the directors of the
Association and of NRMA
Insurance respectively. They are matters which would enable the members of the
Association and members of
NRMA Insurance to make a properly informed judgment
on the restructuring which is proposed in the Notices of Meeting and in the
Prospectus.
They are matters which, in our opinion, are vitally important for
members to be fully and fairly informed. So far as the Prospectus
suggests that
the interests of members of the Association and of NRMA Insurance respectively
are the same, it is in our opinion,
on the facts known to us (which are
basically the facts appearing in the Prospectus) positively misleading.
<P>

15.	There are other criticisms which may be made of the particular statements
in the Prospectus. We shall not deal with all of them.
However to the extent
that the extent that the Prospectus suggests that the shares to be issued by
NRMA Holdings Ltd are `Free Shares',
the Prospectus is also, in our opinion
misleading especially when one considers the widely held membership of the
Association and
of NRMA Insurance and the probable lack of commercial
sophistication of the vast majority of members and of policy holders. The
Prospectus
appears to recognise this by its relentless presentation of friendly
NRMA employees, which would appear to have little to do with
the substance of
its contents.
<P>

16.	In our opinion, the shares which are proposed to be issued cannot in any
sense cannot be termed `Free'. Members of the Association
and of NRMA Insurance
are giving up membership of those companies in return for an agreed issue of
shares in NRMA Holdings Limited,
which is to take over the Association and NRMA
Insurance and all the assets of those companies. In the case of NRMA Insurance,
it
appears very probable that the issue of the shares is not only at the
expense of membership but at what could be considerable cost
to themselves.
Members of NRMA Insurance (who are members of the Association and NRMA
Insurance policy holders) receive twice as
many shares as members of the
Association who are not policy holders in NRMA Insurance. However NRMA
Insurance appears to have investments
worth approximately 10 times as much as
those of the Association. Yet these investments are to be pooled for the
benefits of all
members even those who are not policy holders of NRMA Insurance
and are presently not entitled to any voting rights in NRMA Insurance.
<P>

17.	It is stated that the allocation of shares is `in a way the Boards believe
to be fair' (page 8). The reasons for this belief
are not, in our opinion,
explained, in any adequate fashion to enable members to judge their respective
rights as members of the
Association and as members and policy holders in NRMA
Insurance (pages 9 and 12). Nor, in our opinion, is there any information
provided
to enable members of the Association and of NRMA Insurance to judge
whether the benefits from listing NRMA Holdings Ltd as a vehicle
for dealing in
shares reflecting the worth of the Association and of NRMA Insurance will
result in an improved or adverse effect
upon their present rights as members of
the Association and as members of any policy holders of NRMA Insurance
respectively.
<P>

18.	It may also be noted that the Prospectus appears to give an unqualified
assurance that the Association and NRMA Insurance will
not substantially change
as to the services provided and as to the costs of those services (page 14-15).
It is difficult to see how
the unqualified statement appearing under the
heading `Will the NRMA Change its Culture?' and "With Shareholders, Will NRMA
pursue
profit at the expense of Service?' (page 14-15) can be made in the terms
in which they have been expressed. There is no reference
to the obligation of
the directors of corporations limited by share capital in relation to the
declaration of appropriate dividends
out of profits available for that purpose,
nor to the ability and perhaps the obligations of future Boards of the
Association and
of NRMA Insurance to change, improve, and to make more
efficient and profitable, their respective methods of operation. At best the
statements under those headings are expectations or aspirations. They are
expressed however, in our opinion as unequivocal assertions
of a continuing and
unchanging state of affairs. That is, in our opinion, misleading.
<P>

19.	Accordingly, as we have said, in our opinion, the notices of meeting in the
Prospectus do not provide proper or sufficient information
for the members of
the Association and of NRMA Insurance to judge whether or not the resolutions
and restructuring prosed [sic] should
be passed. Proceedings may be commenced
by persons with an appropriate interest in the Federal Court of Australia in
substance to
require the Association and its Board not to proceed with the
proposed restructure and general meetings until members of both companies
have
been fully and fairly informed of their rights. The form of those proceedings
requires further consideration."
<P>

1065	Many of these matters can be seen in the reasons of Gummow J, but
many can not.  Less of these matters can be seen in the reasons
of the Full
Court.  That the prospectus was misleading in describing the shares to be
issued by Holdings as free shares was seen
as a particular matter for
criticism, because members were giving up membership in return for an agreed
issue of shares in Holdings
and also because in the case of Insurance the
shares did not reflect Insurance's dominant worth.  The opinion noted, however,
disclosure
that membership was given up in return for the shares (para 13.1).
The second ground is not found in the judgments, no doubt because
it rested
upon membership of Insurance carrying with it an entitlement to that worth,
which it did not.  The opinion demonstrates
the scope for contention that a
document such as the prospectus does not provide adequate information or is
misleading, whether or
not at the level of nitpicking.
<P>

1066	The instruction given by the comparison between the reasons for the
conclusion at which Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri arrived
and the reasons in due
course given by Gummow J and the Full Court includes that lawyers can and do
properly differ in their views,
and that being held to be wrong does not
necessarily connote negligence.
<P>

1067	The Federal Court proceedings were commenced on 22September 1994.  In the
application filed on that date the basis for the
relief sought was reflected in
the claim for a declaration -
<P>

"...THAT, upon the true construction of the Prospectus of NRMA Holdings Ltd
issued 23 August 1994 and the Notices of General Meeting
of NRMA Ltd and NRMA
Insurance Ltd and Forms of Proxy contained therein;
<P>

(a)	members of NRMA Ltd and NRMA Insurance Ltd are not fully, fairly and
adequately informed of the proposals the subject of the
resolutions to be put
before them or of the offers made in the Prospectus;
<P>

(b)	the Prospectus and the information in it are misleading and deceptive in
certain particulars, inter alia:
<P>

(i)	insofar as it is suggested that the shares in NRMA Holdings Ltd to be
offered are `Free Shares';
<P>

(ii)	insofar as it is suggested that members of the Association and members of
NRMA Insurance have similar interests;
<P>

(iii)	insofar as the Prospectus fails to inform members of NRMA Ltd or NRMA
Insurance Ltd either or at all or adequately of the
matters set out in
paragraphs 18(c) to (g) and 19(a) to (d), of the affidavit of Richard Talbot,
sworn in support of this Application.
<P>

(c)	the directors of NRMA Ltd, NRMA Insurance Ltd, and NRMA Holdings are in
breach of duty in failing to fully, fairly, and adequately
inform members of
the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above."
<P>

1068	The matters set out in the paragraphs of Mr Talbot's affidavit
were -
<P>

"18.	I also believe that, and as a director of the Association, I am concerned
that:
<P>

	...
<P>

(c)	members asked to vote may in fact lose more present low cost (non-taxable)
services which are worth more to members that taxable
dividends;
<P>

(d)	the cost of flotation to be borne by members has not be [sic] fully
outlined;
<P>

(e)	investment uncertainties arising out of the flotation and affecting the
value of shares have not been fully and frankly stated;
<P>

(f)	members are not being given adequate data about share price and tax
treatment to make informed decision.
<P>

(g)	the Prospectus makes no statement that the share float will swamp the
insurance sector of the Stock Exchange leading possibly
to a depressed return
for members.
<P>

19.	I also believe that, and as a director of the Association, I am concerned
that the Prospectus fails to adequately or (in some
cases at all) make
reference to:
<P>

(a)	the loss of NRMA Mutuality Exemption
<P>

(b)	the loss of NRMA Capital Gains Tax Exempt Assets
<P>

(c)	the Loss of NRMA Franking Account Balances
<P>

(d)	Capital Gains Tax of `Free' Shares"
<P>

1069	The affidavit was lengthy and, apart from the particular matters in paras
18(c) to (g) and 19(a) to (d), asserted failure to
outline "the negative
consequences and detriment (the NO CASE) flowing to existing members" and
complexity and difficulty of understanding.
<P>

1070	Association and Insurance briefed Mr Peter Hely QC for the hearing of the
Federal Court proceedings before Gummow J commencing
on 5 October 1994.
Holdings briefed Mr Emmett.  The applicants were represented by Mr Garnsey, and
the ASC by Mr Steven Rares SC.
 
<P>

1071	By the commencement of the hearing a statement of claim had been filed.
The statement of claim was amended on 6 October 1994.
 It was limited to the
issues directed to be separately decided, and the applicants' case as found in
the amended statement of claim
was different in many respects from that in the
application.  
<P>

1072	The case was one of misleading conduct for reasons particularised in paras
7 and 8 -
<P>

"7.1	The Prospectus contains documents for the proceedings of three different
corporations with different actual or prospective
members and does not clearly
or adequately differentiate between the documents nor attribute responsibility
for them.  The Prospectus
attempts to suggest that there is and will be no
substantial difference between membership of Holdings, the Association and of
Insurance.
<P>

7.2	The rights and interests of the Association and of Insurance and of the
members of the Association and of Insurance respectively
were and are
substantially different and in conflict in relation to the Restructure and the
Share Issue.
<P>

...
<P>

7.5	The Prospectus does not comply with the requirements of section 1022 of the
Corporations Law.  The applicants rely on sub-sections
1022(1)(a) and (b), (2),
and 3(a) and (b), the Prospectus' contents, and the composition, nature and
size of the widely held membership
of the Association and Insurance.
<P>

7.6	The Prospectus conveyed the misrepresentations more particularly alleged in
paragraph 8 below.
<P>

7.7	The Prospectus omitted to inform members of Insurance of their rights as
members to determine the structure and to control the
disposition of the assets
and undertaking of Insurance as a separate corporate entity and separately from
the Association.
<P>

7.8	The Prospectus omitted to convey information of any substance, or any
information, as the case may be, to members of the Association
and to members
of Insurance, relating to the detriment or possible detriment to them of the
Restructure and the Share Issue arising
out of 
<P>

(a)	the change in status of the Association and of Insurance and its effect on
the provision and cost of the services provided by
those corporation [sic] and
the NRMA Group;
<P>

(b)	liability to capital gains tax and income tax in connection with the Share
Issue;
<P>

(c)	diminished or withdrawn social security benefits as a result of the Share
Issue or related cash offer.
<P>

7.9	The Proxy Forms accompanying the Notices of Meeting in the Prospectus
unless read and completed with extreme care and an unreasonably
high degree of
skill favoured the Chairman and the Directors supporting the Restructure and
Share Issue.
<P>

7.10	A relevant summary of the new Memoranda and Articles of Association of the
Association and of Insurance to be adopted in the
proposed resolution did not
accompany the Notices of Meeting and no adequate information of their content
was provided.
<P>

...
<P>

<b>Concerning Members of Insurance</b>
<P>

8.1	That the Share Issue for members of Insurance adequately reflected the
value of the assets and undertaking of Insurance and/or
the rights of members
of Insurance and the value of that membership.
<P>

8.2	That members of Insurance should vote for the Restructure and accept the
Share Issue or associated cash offer as in their interests
and/or as adequately
reflecting the value of the assets and undertaking of Insurance and/or the
rights of members of Insurance and
the value of that membership.
<P>

8.3	That the Association controls Insurance.
<P>

8.4	That as a result of the Association's control of Insurance by appointing
the Board of Insurance and the requirement that policyholder
members of
Insurance be members of the Association, the interests of members of Insurance
and of members of the Association in relation
to the Restructure were the same
as or similar.
<P>

8.5	That the Boards of Association and of Insurance considered that, because of
the Association's control of Insurance by appointing
the Board of Insurance and
the requirement that policyholder members of Insurance be members of the
Association, the interests of
members of Insurance and of members of the
Association in relation to the Restructure and the Association were the same or
similar.
<P>

8.6	That the members of Insurance did not have any rights as members which
would enable them to pass resolutions dealing separately
with the status of
Insurance, their shares in Insurance, the listing of Insurance on the Stock
Exchanges, and/or the assets and undertaking
of Insurance.
<P>

<b>Concerning "Free Shares"</b>
<P>

8.7	That the shares proposed to be issued to members of the Association and to
members of Insurance were free of any surrender of
rights of any value, benefit
or worth by members in the Restructure.
<P>

8.8	That the shares proposed to be issued to members of the Association and to
members of Insurance were free of any detriment to
members arising out of the
Restructure.
<P>

8.9	that the Restructure and Share Issue would only benefit members of the
Association and members of Insurance by conferring on
them shares at no cost or
detriment to members.
<P>

<b>The necessity for the Restructure</b>
<P>

8.10	That the wealth of the NRMA Group could only be unlocked and of benefit to
members by the Restructure and Share Issue.
<P>

<b>Future Matters</b>
<P>

8.11	That Holdings will conduct its business and undertaking so as not to
affect in any substantial way the extent of the services
or the cost of
services presently provided to members of the Association and of Insurance by
the NRMA Group.
<P>

8.12	That there is no appreciable risk that Holdings will conduct its business
and undertaking so as to affect in any substantial
way the extent of the
services or the cost of services presently provided to members of the
Association and of Insurance by the NRMA
Group.
<P>

8.13	That the extent of the services and the cost of services presently
provided to members of the Association and of Insurance
by the NRMA Group will
not be affected by the Restructure.
<P>

8.14	That Holdings will not be able to be controlled by one person or
corporation or by persons or corporations in the same interest.
<P>

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
<P>

8.15	That only one Director of Insurance is against the Restructure and Share
Issue.
<P>

8.16	That the Prospectus complies with the requirements of the Corporations
Law."
<P>

1073	The case as particularised was still much wider than that eventually
upheld.  Similar comment may be made, and instruction
gained, as in relation to
the opinion of Mr Garnsey and mr Camilleri.
<P>

1074	Numerous affidavits had been filed, but most of those filed on behalf of
the applicants were not read or rejected;  only a
relatively formal affidavit
of Mr Talbot was read, putting before the court the memoranda and articles of
Association, Insurance
and Holdings, the prospectus, and the onsert.  Most of a
lengthy affidavit of Mr Willing was read, and he was cross-examined.  There
remained to be heard other issues in the Federal Court proceedings, in summary
whether the directors of Association, Insurance, and
Holdings had breached
their duties in failing properly to inform members, whether Mr Talbot had
wrongly been denied access to corporate
information, and whether certain
amendments to the memorandum and articles of Association passed at its annual
general meeting in
1993 were invalid.  
<P>

1075	In the present proceedings AAH submitted that the evidence before the
Federal Court going to the misleading nature of the prospectus
and the onsert
was much less than the evidence before me, part of a wider submission "that the
facts established by the evidence
in this case are relevantly different to
[sic] the facts capable of being established by the evidence before the Federal
Court, thus
the findings by the Federal Court of contravention of s 52 is [sic]
neither relevant nor a reliable guide to whether [AAH] breached
any duty".  I
am only too well aware of the amount of evidence before me.  As I understand
it, AAH had in mind the evidence before
me going to whether there were in truth
material undisclosed disadvantages in the proposal.
<P>

<b>Appeal from Gummow J?</b>
<P>

1076	The boards of Association and Insurance met jointly on the afternoon of 13
October 1994.  In accordance with the decision of
Gummow J, it was
resolved to adjourn the general meetings fixed for 19 October 1994.
Mr Mackay moved and Mr Kirby seconded motions
that the boards still
believed it was in the best interest of members for the NRMA to become publicly
listed, which motions were
carried.  Ms Singleton requested that her
dissent be noted.  There was one other dissent from the Association motion, but
the minutes
did not identify the dissentient.  Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser were
not present,  Mr Lawson was, and he was probably the other dissentient.
<P>

1077	The NRMA considered whether to appeal from the decision of Gummow J.
A notice of motion seeking leave to appeal was filed on
18 October 1994, before
the question of an appeal formally came before the boards.  This was done
ultimately on the instructions
of Mr Mackay, it seems after Mr Mackay had
spoken informally to some directors and in order that no time would be lost if
it were
decided to seek leave to appeal.  
<P>

1078	Two counsel advised on the prospects of an appeal, Mr David Jackson QC and
Mr Heydon.  There was some contention in the proceedings
over their briefings
and the disclosure of their opinions.  Before going to the briefings and the
disclosure of the opinions, I will
go to the opinions themselves, and to the
NRMA decision.
<P>

1079	The opinion of Mr Jackson was dated 19 October 1994.  Mr Jackson
identified the question on which he was asked to advise as
the prospects of
success of an appeal from the decision of Gummow J.  He identified as the
matters underlying his Honour's finding
of misleading conduct three topics in
the prospectus, namely (a) the treatment of the relationship between
Association and Insurance;
 (b) the description and use of the description
"Free Shares";  and (c) the emphasis upon there being "business as usual".  
<P>

1080	As to (a), Mr Jackson said that different minds could arrive at
different views, but that in his opinion the result arrived
at by Gummow J
was the better view of the matter because he considered that the prospectus
glossed over what was ultimately a critical
matter, namely, that there were two
separate corporate entities, one having the lion's share of the money but
having also a smaller
membership than the other, and that the positions of the
two entities had to be dealt with separately.  As to (b), Mr Jackson did
not think that Gummow J treated it as a separate issue, saying "To my mind
it is simply an aspect of the prospectus's treatment of
the two companies".  As
to (c), Mr Jackson thought that if Gummow J was treating it in
isolation he was in error, but if he was treating
it as an aspect of the
failure to deal satisfactorily with the separate position of members of
Association and Insurance he was correct
in so doing.  He concluded his
advice -
<P>

"In the result my view is that the conclusion arrived at by Gummow J was
correct. An element of impression is involved, of course,
and there is a
possibility of success of an appeal against that decision. I regard the
probability, however, as being that an appeal
would fail."
<P>

1081	As matters fell out, Mr Jackson was correct in the result but not in how
it was reached.  The view he took of Gummow J's reasons
was rather different
from that taken by the Full Court.  Something like topic (a) was recognised in
the Full Court, but it was held
that Gummow J was in error.  Topic (b) was
treated as more than an aspect of the prospectus' treatment of the two
companies.  Topic
(c), business as usual, was not seen as part of the separate
position of members of Association and Insurance, although it may have
been
part of what I have called the disadvantages question.  There is another
reminder of how legal minds can reasonably differ.
<P>

1082	The opinion of Mr Heydon was dated 20 October 1994.  Mr Heydon said
that he had been asked to advise whether there were prospects
of successfully
appealing against the decision of Gummow J.  He said that that depended on
whether there were to be found errors
of law, or errors in the application of
the law to the prospectus and onsert as described by Gummow J, within his
Honour's reasons.
 
<P>

1083	Mr Heydon did not think there was any error in the statements of, or
assumptions about, the applicable law.  As to application
of the law to the
facts, he also saw his Honour's conclusions as falling under three heads,
although overlapping, the first being
issues concerning the relationship
between Association and Insurance, the second being issues to do with the
expression "Free Shares",
and the third being issues connected with the
contention that in future members would enjoy "business as usual" without any
change
in the NRMA's "culture".  
<P>

1084	As to the first group of issues, for reasons which he gave Mr Heydon
thought that Gummow J was unlikely to be overturned, and
in particular
seemed to endorse the view that the members of Association and Insurance "were
entitled to a fuller account of the
problems of the proposal so far as the
relative position of the two company were concerned, and of its pros and cons".

<P>

1085	What Mr Heydon said as to the second group of issues should be set out in
more detail, so that it can be understood together
with his opinions of 2 and 3
August 1994.  He said -
<P>

"Gummow J's [ reasons] were:
<P>

(a)	If `Free Shares' meant that the shares do not carry the need to make any
payment, the expression would be correct, but that
is not what is meant by the
phrase (page 55), because of the extremely large number of instances where
`Free Shares' is not used
in apposition to the shares obtained under the `Sale
Offer'.
<P>

(b)	Instead what the phrase `Free Shares' means is `shares given without
consideration'. Though some passages make it plain that
they were not given
without consideration, since something is given up for them (ie membership of
the two companies), he considered
that the `effect of the persistent
reiteration of the phrase `Free Shares' is to engender in the reader the notion
that the shares
may be acquired without any significant loss or outgoing to the
offeree who accepts them.' (page 56). In that sense the expression
is
misleading. (Indeed, although Gummow J does not make this point, it would be
fatal to the proposal if the shares in Holdings were
issued without
consideration (or, as a submission recorded on page 56 says, with `no
significant consideration'), for they would
then be issued at a discount in
breach of the general principles of company law: <u>Ford's Principles of
Corporation Law</u>, 6th edition, paragraph 8211). What the members were losing
was:
<P>

(i)	in the case of members of Insurance, their membership and their powers at a
general meeting (page 56);
<P>

(ii)	in the case of members of the Association, their membership, particularly
the power to 200 members to requisition meetings,
and the power of members to
elect directors (a considerable power where `one member one vote' applies, as
distinct from the power
of large institutional shareholders using proxies in
Holdings after the proposal goes through - in contrast to the status quo, which
permits dissident directors to be elected with relative ease) (see pages
56-57);
<P>

(iii)	`cheap road service' and `at least for the present, insurance rebates'
(see page 57 read with page 21).
<P>

(c)	In short, the shares were not free, though the decision to consent to the
proposal and either obtain them or their cash equivalent
depended on the need
to weigh competing advantages and disadvantages (page 57); in that regard there
was failure to disclose that
retention of the status quo would produce the
advantages, failure to reveal how the proposal would render accessible hitherto
inaccessible
wealth, and failure to reveal how this would affect members of the
Association considered separately from members of Insurance (page
58).
<P>

Plainly to some extent this repeats some of Gummow J's reasoning in relation to
the first head.
<P>

...
<P>

One key element of Gummow J's reasoning as to the construction of `Free Shares
turns on his view that misleading impressions given
by the phrases in
particular parts of the documents are not cured by recourse to a context, or to
an explanation, to be found in
other parts. To some extent this was because of
the large number of occasions on which the phrase was used compared to the
small
number of references to the Sale Shares or the giving up of membership.
Another basis on which his conclusions can be justified is
that, given the very
large class addressed and the wide range of skills, interest and diligence of
its members, it cannot be assumed
that a reader who sees `Free Shares' in one
place will pick up the appropriate clarificatory context or fuller explanation
in other
places (at least in the absence of quite explicit cross-referencing,
which is not present in the prospectus). Whatever the minimum
standard to be
expected of the class, it is only a paragon who is likely to be in a position
to read the entire set of documents
steadily and with comprehension. The duty
to avoid misleading the reader is a duty to ensure that specific passages do
not mislead,
not merely a duty to ensure that taken as a whole the prospectus
is not misleading."
<P>

1086	As to the third group of issues, Mr Heydon express the view that
Gummow J's conclusion would not be disturbed, saying that
it was a
material matter in considering what would happen when a business structure was
changed to know what the intentions of the
future controllers of the business
were and that "The passages quoted on pages 58-63 say something on that
subject, but not in any
clear detail".
<P>

1087	Mr Heydon concluded by expressing the opinion that "any appeal against the
orders made by Gummow J will fail".  
<P>

1088	Mr Heydon's pessimism as to the first group of issues was really not borne
out in the reasons of the Full Court.  Nor was his
analysis of the reasons of
Gummow J fully borne out, although in part the link with the disadvantages
question was recognised.  In
passing, Mr Heydon still had in mind that shares
issued without consideration would be issued at a discount and, in language
used
in his earlier opinions, that that would be fatal to the proposal, but he
plainly enough saw whether describing the shares as free
shares was misleading
as a separate legal issue.  Implicit in Mr Heydon's opinion was that the parts
of the prospectus conveying
that membership was being given up and the shares
were being issued in return for membership were properly held by Gummow J to be
inadequate to overcome the impression created by the extensive use of "Free
Shares".
<P>

1089	The boards of Association and Insurance met late on 21 October 1994.
Present as the board of Association were Mr Mackay, Ms
Ralph, Ms Booth, Mr
Burrows, Mr Douglass, Mr Farr-Jones, Mr Jack, Ms Singleton, Mr Talbot, and Dr
Werner.  Present as the board of
Insurance were Mr Mackay, Mr Jack, Mr Burrows,
Mr Corrigan, Mr Douglas, Mr Easson, Mr Farr-Jones, Ms Singleton, and Mr
Willing. 
It was recorded that Mr Talbot left the meeting before the business
concerning an appeal and returned after that business.  
<P>

1090	According to the minutes the meeting lasted for six minutes, and as the
substantive business -
<P>

"<b>FEDERAL COURT APPEAL:</b>
<P>

The Board noted the letter from Abbott Tout, Solicitors, dated 21 October
1994.
<P>

The Board resolved unanimously that the lodgment of an application for leave to
appeal against the decision of Mr Justice Gummow
be ratified.
<P>

<b>MEDIATION:</b>
<P>

The Board resolved unanimously, in the interests of the NRMA members,
policyholders and staff:
<P>

1.	to seek mediation on the key issues in contention in relation to the future
direction of the NRMA;
<P>

2.	that Sir Laurence Street be appointed as mediator;
<P>

3.	to ensure any changes to the organisation be ultimately decided by the
members on the basis of full information;
<P>

4.	to proceed with the appeal on the Gummow judgment in the Federal Court of
Australia in order, in particular, to clarify the relationship
between NRMA
Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited;
<P>

5.	that the NRMA meet reasonable costs in these appeal proceedings of Miss Dawn
Fraser and Mr Richard Talbot;
<P>

6.	that the NRMA seek to have the costs and other proceedings listed for next
Tuesday adjourned for one week.
<P>

Further that these issues be revisited at the next Board meeting due to be held
next Thursday, 27 October 1994.
<P>

The Board resolved unanimously that the abovementioned resolution be the
entirety of any public statement made by the organisation
on the matter."
<P>

1091	The minutes did not refer to the opinions of Mr Jackson and Mr Heydon.
Neither opinion was put before the boards (I so find
despite Mr Mackay's
recollection that Mr Jackson's opinion was tabled).  What was put before the
boards was an AT letter of 21 October
1994.  It did not refer to the opinions.
It was a letter from Mr John Bartrop, a partner of AT, to the directors of
Insurance, reading
-
<P>

"We have been asked to advise on the following matters:
<P>

1.	What grounds exist for appealing the decision of Gummow J given on 13
October 1994?
<P>

2.	Is there justification for such an appeal?
<P>

As to 1, the grounds of appeal are set out in the attached draft Notice of
Appeal.
<P>

As to 2, in our view there is justification for lodging such an appeal.
<P>

Our reasons for holding this view are as follows:
<P>

(a)	an appeal may succeed;
<P>

(b)	if an appeal succeeds the current proposal may proceed;
<P>

(c)	while an appeal may fail, none the less, such appeal may clarify various
uncertainties in the judgment of Gummow J, including
the issue of whether or
not the Association controls Insurance.
<P>

If such clarification is obtained the company will be assisted in properly
placing before its members any future proposal to restructure
the NRMA
Group.
<P>

Even if no such proposal (for restructuring the NRMA Group) was contemplated
the possibility of obtaining clarification of that
control issue is important
to Insurance.
<P>

In the context of this matter in our view the legal costs associated with
appealing are not significant to the decision.
<P>

Finally, you should be aware that the application for expedition has been stood
over until Monday 24 October 1994. Counsel for Miss
Fraser and Mr Talbot
indicated they supported the resolution of an appeal as soon as practically
possible."
<P>

1092	I come then to the contention over the briefings of Mr Jackson and Mr
Heydon and the disclosure of their opinions.  It was
in two broad areas.  One
focussed on Mr Bateman's involvement, the other on how the NRMA came to decide
to appeal.
<P>

1093	A document which I accept as an AT file note dated 17 October 1994
appeared to record a conference between persons identified
by the initials TMG,
JHB, GAB, and MAH at which there was reference to briefing Mr Jackson for
advice on the prospects of an appeal.
 The initials were those of Mr Tim
Griffiths, Mr Bartrop, Mr Bateman, and Mr Mark Harrowell.  Mr Griffiths and Mr
Harrowell were
also partners of AT, and had been involved in acting for
Association and Insurance in the proceedings before Gummow J.  
<P>

1094	Another AT file note dated 17 October 1994 indicated instructions from Ms
Conway to brief Mr Jackson, including the words "Three
directors agreed to
appeal - subject to independent advice".  
<P>

1095	Mr Jackson was briefed on behalf of Association and Insurance on 17
October 1994, the letter accompanying the brief being written
by Mr Bartrop,
and he was asked to advise before the next Wednesday "at which time the Boards
of our clients will be meeting".  He
conferred with someone from AT on 18
October 1994, and was briefed on behalf of Holdings on 19 October with a
covering letter in
the same terms as before.  His opinion was marked with Mr
Harrowell's initials as the relevant person within AT.
<P>

1096	None of Mr Griffiths, Mr Bartrop and Mr Harrowell, or Mr Jackson, gave
evidence, and there was no more direct evidence of how
Mr Jackson came to be
briefed.  Ms Conway recalled that an opinion was obtained from Mr Jackson, but
could not recall the circumstances.
 
<P>

1097	Ms Conway did say, however, that it was resolved not to brief Mr Heydon
because he had been involved in giving advice, and
hence Mr Jackson was
selected.  While it seems that Ms Conway knew that someone at Abbott Tout was
"talking to Dyson Heydon about
the judgment" and said that he was
unsympathetic, she denied that the NRMA instructed Abbott Tout to obtain Mr
Heydon's opinion.
 A memorandum of fees indicates that Mr Heydon was
nonetheless briefed by Mr Harrowell, and that Mr Heydon saw Mr Bartrop and Mr
Harrowell in conference on 20 October 1994.  Mr Mackay said that he did not
know of Mr Heydon's opinion, although he knew of Mr Jackson's
opinion.  
<P>

1098	The picture as presented was that the briefing of Mr Heydon was unknown to
the NRMA, perhaps by AT for its own purposes (and
it is understandable that AT
might have wished to obtain an opinion for itself).  The complications were,
however, that another AT
file note dated 19 October 1994 stated "Helen:  We are
instructed to get opinion on prospects from Heydon QC", and that by a letter
dated 27 October 1994 Mr Bartrop sent to the NRMA, for the attention of Ms
Conway, the memoranda of fees of both Mr Jackson and Mr
Heydon.  The picture,
and Ms Conway's denial, seemed to be incorrect.  Ms Conway said that she did
not see the memoranda of fees,
because they were not endorsed as they would
have been had she seen them, but it still seems that the NRMA did instruct AT
to obtain
Mr Heydon's opinion.
<P>

1099	The NRMA was in a difficult position, in that its litigious opponents Mr
Talbot and Miss Fraser were members of one of its
boards.  Were they entitled
to see any advice obtained by the NRMA?  Another AT file note, dated 19 October
1994 and in different
writing from the file note of 17 October 1994, suggested
a telephone conversation between its author and "GAB" (no one other than
Mr
Bateman was identified with those initials);  the only information as to the
content was "Jackson Advice By Board meeting?"  On
the same piece of paper the
same author recorded a telephone conversation with "Helen", it would seem Ms
Conway, on 20 October 1994,
with the content recorded "Can Fraser + Talbot
participate in discussing appeal.  Advice.  Need legal advice tomorrow re 3
directors.
 If don't want to put in writing".  
<P>

1100	This was clearly enough linked with a memorandum dated 21 October 1994
from Mr Richard Willcock of AT addressed to Messrs Bartrop,
Bateman and
Harrowell, on the topic "Disclosure of legal advice to all directors".  Mr
Willcock began the memorandum -
<P>

"You have asked me to consider how the Boards of NRMA Limited and N.R.M.A.
Insurance Limited should deal with any documents which
are provided to them
which contain advices concerning the present proceedings.
<P>

I understand that Greg Bateman has given some advice concerning the formation
of a committee to which each Board may elect to delegate
its powers concerning
(relevantly) the receipt and consideration of legal advice concerning the
proceedings.
<P>

I proceed on the basis that such a committee does not presently exist."
<P>

1101	After discussing the law, Mr Willcock suggested a course of action whereby
advices might properly not be made known to Mr Talbot,
Miss Fraser, and
possibly Ms Singleton.
<P>

1102	This difficulty in the NRMA's position may explain why Mr Jackson was
apparently re-briefed on behalf of Holdings rather than
Association and
Insurance.  It may also explain why, rightly or wrongly, the opinions were not
provided to the boards.  And it is
apparent that the joint board meeting for
six minutes was not the real forum for deciding whether or not to appeal.  I
have referred
to the AT letter of 21 October 1994.  In fact the letter was
provided earlier than the joint board meeting.  According to Mr Bateman,
he
accompanied Messrs Bartrop and Harrowell to the place where a meeting was being
held, and the three of them waited outside the
meeting.  Ms Conway left the
meeting from time to time to tell them what was occurring.  On one such
occasion Ms Conway told them
that the directors did not want to appeal against
the decision of Gummow J.  Mr Harrowell said "But there are reasons to appeal",
and Ms Conway said, "Well, you give us an advice on why we should appeal".  The
letter was then prepared by Mr Harrowell, and after
typing at the AT offices
was brought to him.  Mr Bateman, Mr Bartrop, and Mr Harrowell then went into
the meeting, and Mr Harrowell
spoke to the letter.  The key to understanding
this is that the meeting was not the joint board meeting.  It was a meeting
earlier
in the day, at the offices of the firm of which Mr Mackay was a
partner, attended by Mr Mackay, Mr Kirby, Dame Leonie Kramer, Mr
Burrows, Mr
Douglass, Mr Willing, and other directors, but not by Mr Talbot, Ms Singleton,
Ms Fraser, or Mr Lawson.
<P>

1103	Why did the parties spend a not inconsiderable time in contention over the
briefings and the disclosure of the opinions?  In
the excitement of the hunt,
they may have overlooked the value of the quarry.  While dealing with the
matter at the length I have,
I do not think it has great significance.
<P>

1104	As I have said, Mr Bateman gave evidence that he had not seen either the
opinion of Mr Jackson or the opinion of Mr Heydon
at the time.  He recalled
being told that Mr Jackson had been briefed, but not being told of the result,
and said that he was heavily
engaged at the time with matters to do with the
general meetings.  The NRMA said that this did not sit well with participation
in
briefing Mr Jackson apparent from the file notes of 17 and 19 October 1994,
with participation in advising on disclosure of advice
concerning the Federal
Court proceedings to Mr Talbot and others apparent from Mr Willcock's
memorandum, or with his presence at
the time of the informal meeting on 21
October 1994.  It was suggested that Mr Bateman was less than frank in his
evidence in this
area, and was seeking to distance himself from the predicament
in which the NRMA then found itself, and that this showed awareness
of neglect
in his duties contributing to the predicament.  For their part, the defendants
said that the mystery surrounding briefing
Mr Heydon, the failure to make the
opinions available to the boards, and the provision of the AT letter of 21
October 1994 which
hardly advised on the prospects of an appeal (it said an
appeal may or may not succeed, without reasoning), all pointed to a situation
brought about by Mr Mackay to ensure that the boards resolved to undertake the
appeal in ignorance of any prognosis of failure. 
This, it was said, was
another indication, relevant to whether the NRMA would have gone ahead with the
proposal in the face of the<i> </i>Gambotto advice, of the determination of Mr
Mackay and an inner group of directors to proceed with the proposal at all
costs.
<P>

1105	In drawing inferences, I consider that I can assume that the evidence of
none of Mr Bartrop, Mr Harrowell, or other AT solicitors
involved would have
assisted AT's position:  the failure to call these persons who could have
provided assistance was unexplained.
 Mr Mackay said that there was good reason
to appeal even if the appeal did not overturn the injunction granted by Gummow
J, because
the appeal could clarify, and possibly reverse, his Honour's view of
the control of Insurance.  That can be seen in the AT letter
of 21 October
1994, and in the resolutions of the boards (including the resolution to meet
the costs of Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser),
and I accept that it was seen as
providing good reason to appeal.  
<P>

1106	It is nonetheless strange that the boards, or at least the informal
meeting on 21 October 1994, were not told of the opinions,
and fear that Mr
Talbot would come to know of the advice is not a satisfactory explanation for
failure to tell the boards, in the
absence of Mr Talbot, that the advice was
that an appeal would fail.  Indeed, Mr Mackay did not give that explanation, or
any explanation:
 if it were thought the advice could not be kept from Ms
Singleton and that Ms Singleton would tell Mr Talbot, he did not say so.

<P>

1107	There is uncertainty in any conclusions.  On balance, I find that Ms
Conway instructed AT to brief Mr Jackson and Mr Heydon
on the prospects of an
appeal, but that Mr Bartrop and Mr Harrowell took up the instructions and Mr
Bateman had little to do with
the briefings.  One or both of Mr Bartrop and Mr
Harrowell knew that the opinions were negative.  I am not satisfied that Mr
Bateman
knew what the opinions were, and Mr Bateman's involvement was ancillary
to that of his partners (although extending to involvement
in advance
concerning disclosure to Mr Talbot, Miss Fraser, and Ms Singleton).  Mr Mackay
knew of Mr Jackson's opinion, but it may
be that Ms Conway did not pass on to
him the similarly negative opinion of Mr Heydon.  Mr Mackay had initiated the
appeal prior to
the opinions, saw good reason to appeal at least in relation to
the control of Insurance, and I see no acceptable alternative to
the conclusion
that, wishing that there should be an appeal, he ensured that the negative
opinion of Mr Jackson was not made known
to the directors.  I do not accept
that Mr Bateman was less than frank or seeking to distance himself from the
NRMA's predicament.
 I accept that Mr Mackay revealed determination that there
should be an appeal, but I do not extend that to determination to proceed
with
the proposal at all costs.
<P>

<b>To the decision of the Full Court</b>
<P>

1108	So far as the evidence showed, any consideration by the NRMA of what it
would do if an appeal failed, or even if an appeal
were successful, was not
prominent in the weeks after 21 October 1994.  Attention was concentrated on
the mediation the subject of
one of the resolutions of 21 October 1994.  The
mediation was undertaken with the Honourable G D Needham QC as mediator, but it
came
to no result and it need not be mentioned again.  
<P>

1109	Shortly before the hearing of the motion for leave to appeal
Mr Morgan prepared a draft memorandum dated 15 November 1994,
expressed to
give consideration "to the contents of any future NRMA Prospectus or,
alternatively, the processes involved if a scheme
of arrangement was
undertaken."  It seems that the memorandum was not immediately provided to the
NRMA.  It included a paragraph
concerning <i>Gambotto's case</i> on which the
NRMA placed some reliance in these proceedings.  
<P>

1110	The memorandum referred to difficulty in continuing with the then current
prospectus.  If there was a successful appeal, there
were material changes in
circumstances of which notice would have to be given or the accounting
information in the prospectus would
be out of date.  If the appeal was not
successful, then the prospectus would have to be changed in order to meet the
deficiencies
found in the Federal Court proceedings.  The memorandum also
referred to what would be involved if a scheme of arrangement were undertaken,
with the observations that a scheme of arrangement would have the "independent
supervisor" of the Court, independent experts' reports,
and an opportunity for
all opponents to state their positions.  
<P>

1111	This consideration of the future was preceded in the memorandum by a
"background", the commencement of which was -
<P>

"Under the original proposal, we had examined the possible use of a scheme of
arrangement rather than proceeding by way of prospectus
and notice of meeting.
The prospectus and notice of meeting procedure was adopted after Senior Counsel
confirmed that it would bind
members into the proposals. You should note that
one of the principal authorities upon which this view was based is subject to a
High Court appeal and, although the case has been argued, no final  decision
has been made. It is not expected that the High Court's
views will change the
conclusion but it is a matter that needs to be watched."
<P>

The background then went on to say that the scheme of arrangement was
considered to be an unsatisfactory approach, because it was
likely to be more
lengthy, it was more complex and less easily explained, it gave opportunities
to raise objections before the court,
and there were some potentially difficult
issues to be resolved particularly as to division of members into classes.
<P>

1112	The confirmation that the prospectus and notice of meeting procedure would
"bind members into the proposals" must have been
either Mr Heydon's opinion of
20 December 1993 or his opinion of 28 July 1994;  more likely the former, since
the background spoke
of the initial consideration of the alternative routes.
The authority to which Mr Morgan intended to refer was <i>Gambotto's case.</i>
The statement that the confirmation was based on <i>Gambotto's case</i>,
amongst other authorities, was probably not accurate, but involved recognition
that <i>Gambotto's case</i> was a material authority.  As I have earlier
recorded, according to Mr Morgan he became aware that <i>Gambotto's case</i>
was on appeal to the High Court in the course of the proceedings before Gummow
J.  
<P>

1113	The NRMA's reliance was, in short, that if an appeal in <i>Gambotto's
case</i> needed to be watched in November 1994 it had needed to be watched in
late 1993 and early 1994:  so a lawyer acting properly should
have found out
about the special leave application and the appeal and should have given the
Gambotto advice.
<P>

1114	It does not seem that Mr Morgan, or anyone else, conveyed to the NRMA at
this time that the reserved decision in <i>Gambotto's case</i> could be an
impediment to the proposal, or at least it was not conveyed with any force.
Two of the directors gave evidence suggesting
reference to <i>Gambotto's
case</i>.  
<P>

1115	According to Dr Werner, he heard of <i>Gambotto's case</i> at some time
before Christmas 1994, in the discussions concerning the decision of Gummow J
and the appeal to the Full Court.  He
was uncertain as to the time, and did not
have a clear recollection of what was said.  He recalled somebody saying that
the Federal
Court proceedings "might not be the only problem you've got", and
in explanation "a bit of discussion then about Gummow [sic;  Gambotto]".
 His
evidence then was -
<P>

"Q.  What's your best recollection now of what you were told about Gambotto at
that time?  
<P>

A.  Well, I've just described that it - I understood - well, apart from the
mechanics, that is to say that Mr Gambotto had taken
the matter to the Supreme
Court, there was an appeal, he had applied to the High Court for right of
appeal to the High Court and
that had been granted.  Those kinds of things
aside, I was told or I'd heard that the problem, as I say, was associated with
the
rights of minority groups of share holders or people with certain rights
and that Mr Gambotto's problem was that he was arguing that
a certain take-over
abrogated the rights of certain minority groups.  That's my best memory of
it."
<P>

1116	Mr Lawson also gave evidence of a recollection of hearing about
<i>Gambotto's case</i> before the decision of the High Court, as something
which had "the possibility of impacting on our demutualisation", but he did not
recall when.  
<P>

1117	There was no other evidence of recognition within the NRMA, prior to the
decision of the Full Court, of a possible difficulty,
and persons such as Mr
Mackay and Ms Conway would be expected to have become aware of it if it was
made known.  I think it likely
that Dr Werner and Mr Lawson misplaced their
awareness of Gambotto's case, and that their recollections were really of later
awareness,
probably of awareness in late February or early March 1995 in
connection with the solicitors' submissions to which I will come, or
even of
awareness after the decision of the High Court.  Neither Dr Werner nor Mr
Lawson, particularly the latter, was a reliable
historian of the timing and
detail of events.
<P>

1118	The motion for leave to appeal was heard on 6 and 7 December 1994, and the
argument proceeded on the basis that, if leave were
granted, the hearing would
be the hearing of the appeal.  Association, Insurance and Holdings were
represented by Mr Bennett.  Mr
Talbot and Miss Fraser were represented by Mr
Garnsey, and the ASC by Mr Rares.  Judgment was reserved.  
<P>

1119	The NRMA was still committed to putting a proposal for restructuring to
members.  At a joint meeting of the boards of Association
and Insurance on 8
December 1994, according to the minutes - 
<P>

"It was further resolved that a proposal for re-structuring the organisation
should be put to the members for decision as early
as possible in 1995 and that
management are authorised to undertake all steps necessary in preparing this.
It was noted that, in
preparing such a proposal, management would seek to
address and incorporate where appropriate the following matters:
<P>

(a)	any issues flowing from the Gummow judgment and the subsequent Appeal
judgment;
<P>

(b)	the views expressed by members during 1994 regarding the `Share the Future'
proposal;  and 
<P>

(c)	submissions from individual Directors relating to issues relevant to any
re-structuring proposal."
<P>

Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser were present:  no voting or dissent was recorded, but
it is unlikely that the resolutions were unanimous.
 
<P>

1120	And outside the boards the resolve of some of the directors to proceed
with the restructuring was illustrated by the formation
of the Motorists'
Majority, with the involvement of (amongst others) Mr Mackay,
Mr Douglass, Mrs Callaghan, Mr Farr-Jones and Mr
Corrigan,
as a body the interests of which included promotion of the restructuring.  
<P>

1121	Some work was done towards an "updated" or supplementary prospectus, for
example, discussions at meetings on 12 and 25 January
1995, but little could
effectively be done until the judgment and reasons of the Full Court were given
and available.  Similarly,
consideration of proceeding with the proposal by a
scheme of arrangement could really not be taken far.
<P>

1122	Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser were not idle, however, and still active in
opposing the proposal.  On their instructions, Mr Garnsey
and Mr Camilleri
prepared an amended application and amended statement of claim in the Federal
Court proceedings, taking account
of further material provided to them and also
seeking preliminary orders to enable Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser to prosecute the
remainder
of the proceedings as a derivative action on behalf of members of
Association and Insurance.  In an opinion dated 23 December 1994
Mr Garnsey and
Mr Camilleri advised that there were good prospects of success in the balance
of the proceedings, and it is clear
that, subject to obtaining legal aid, Mr
Talbot and Miss Fraser were determined to maintain and escalate their
opposition to the
restructuring.  Whether the NRMA knew of the proposed
amendments at this time is not clear, but in due course the Federal Court
proceedings
were enlarged.
<P>

<b>To the decision of the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i></b>
<P>

1123	With the judgment of the Full Court on 27 January 1995, and the further
judgment on 30 January 1995 whereby a supplementary
prospectus was left open,
the NRMA had to decide what to do.  
<P>

1124	The NRMA had earlier considered engaging different solicitors if it took
the proposal back to members, and by letters dated
23 December 1994 had invited
submissions from three firms, Clayton Utz ("CU"), Minter Ellison Morris
Fletcher ("ME"), and Norton
Smith ("NS").  The invitations had included asking
for an evaluation of the prospectus, the approach to any new prospectus, and a
strategy "for assisting the NRMA to move ahead".  
<P>

1125	The submissions had been received by mid-January 1995, and ultimately ME
was retained.  The submissions were quite lengthy,
and I will refer only to
what was said to be relevant to these proceedings.  
<P>

1126	CU foresaw the need for an entirely new prospectus.  It suggested review
of whether schemes of arrangement should be undertaken,
saying that it saw
"potential advantages in a scheme which could be material, although not without
some risk".  It referred to <i>Gambotto's case</i>, although not by name, and
the appeal, in a part of the submission dealing with potential for further
litigation in which two issues
with such a potential were identified, one being
"the legal steps which are proposed to effect the demutualisation" and the
other
being the basis of allocation of shares.  As to the first, it was said
-
<P>

"The new Articles of Association which are to be adopted for each of the
Association and NRMA Insurance, provide for the existing
members, other than
NRMA Holdings, to cease to be members of the Association and NRMA Insurance at
the specified time.  The Prospectus,
Section 1, also stipulates that these
provisions in the Articles will constitute a contract binding on all members
irrespective of
whether or not they vote in favour of the adoption of the new
Articles.
<P>

Presumably, this is based on the assumption that an amendment to the Articles
of Association to provide for the cessation of a member's
membership,
irrespective of whether that member agrees, is binding.  There have been recent
cases which deal with the question of
expropriation of shares in a company
limited by shares, by amendment to the Articles of Association of the relevant
company or by
reduction of capital.  Having regard to the decisions expressed
by the Courts in those cases, we believe that it is possible to provide
for
cancellation of membership of a company limited by guarantee where, as is
proposed in this case, compensation is provided, namely
the opportunity to
receive shares in the new holding company or the cash alternative.  However the
principal case dealing with amendments
to Articles of Association has been
appealed to the High Court and judgment is still awaited.  The cases proceed on
the basis that
the Court will examine closely whether the compensation to be
provided in exchange for extinguishment of existing shareholders' rights
is
fair.  This immediately leads to the second issue, namely the basis of
allocation of shares to the respective members.
<P>

We are aware that there is a contrary view on expropriation and an
off-the-record discussion which we had with a senior officer
of the ASC who is
looking at demutualisation issues, reveals that officer's understanding that
removal of members rights, but not
their membership, is the appropriate way to
proceed.
<P>

The possibility of challenge on this basis cannot be ignored."
<P>

1127	The ME submission also foresaw the need for a new prospectus;  it also
suggested following a scheme of arrangement route, giving
reasons for and
against.  One of the reasons for following a scheme of arrangement route was
that -
<P>

" ... lengthy challenges to the implementation of the proposal, on such grounds
as that the cancellation of memberships is oppressive
or in fraud on the
minority (grounds of uncertain scope in light of the Gambotto litigation) would
effectively be avoided because
the proposal would be sanctioned by orders of
the court."
<P>

  A completely new way of demutualising was raised, but still involving a
resolutions in general meetings route.  
<P>

1128	The NS submission was less detailed, seemed to envisage a new prospectus,
but did say -
<P>

"However we must add the warning that we think that there are further basic
underlying problems with the prospectus (or is it meeting)
approach.  In
particular there is the question of the rights of members between themselves
even forgetting the association/insurance
question.  As a clear example, any
one who has become a member over the last 9 months will receive no benefit at
all.  What is the
`right' of people who became members earlier to leave out
these later one out [sic].  Bearing in mind that everyone has a different
although probably highly undefined interest, how can one member vote away the
different rights of another?
<P>

Possibly we are more sensitive to this than might be generally the case because
of the delay in receiving a judgment from the High
Court in the appeal to that
Court from the Court of Appeal Judgment in <i>WCP v Gambotto.</i>  The recent
judgment of McClelland J [sic] in <i>Melcann v Superjohn</i> is also cause for
concern."
<P>

So NS wondered "whether notice of meetings/prospectus route is the best,
especially given the opposition."
<P>

1129	Apart from being one source of advice about what to do, the submissions
were said to be relevant to these proceedings in that
they showed other lawyers
watching the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  The watchers' gazes went beyond
simple fairness or unfairness.  CU focussed on fairness, but hinted at a more
fundamental basis
of challenge on the ground that membership could not be
cancelled while apparently of the view that such a challenge would not succeed.
ME referred to uncertainty over cancellation of memberships in the light of the
Gambotto litigation, uncertainty which had to go
further than the fairness of
entitlements since the price for the shares in <i>Gambotto's case</i> was
conceded to be fair.  NS questioned how one member can "vote away the different
rights of another", referring to sensitivity
involving the appeal in
<i>Gambotto's case</i>.  Although not in terms, all saw the decision in the
appeal as something to be known in order properly to advise.
<P>

1130	The NRMA received a letter from Mr Morgan to Mr Mackay dated 27 January
1995, clearly enough written with knowledge of the
invitation to other
solicitors and with a view to continued engagement of AAH.  It was in general
terms, contemplating a supplementary
prospectus or a new prospectus depending
on the outcome of the appeal and referring rather in passing to the alternative
route of
a scheme of arrangement.  Even with knowledge of the High Court appeal
in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, Mr Morgan can not have seen it as an impediment to
the resolutions in general meetings route.  
<P>

1131	Mr Morgan then provided, under cover of a letter to Ms Conway dated
31 January 1995, a memorandum concerning a scheme of arrangement
"to put
in place the same result as was envisaged under the prospectus".  The
memorandum was but an outline.  It referred to possible
difficulties because of
different classes of members.  Maybe reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i> should
not have been expected, and in fact no Gambotto concern was expressed.  
<P>

1132	By a further letter to Ms Conway dated 1 February 1995 Mr Morgan
said that, with consideration of the options following the
decision of the Full
Court on the previous day, he did not think a scheme of arrangement "presents
any advantages over the proposal
that has now been made by the Federal Court".
The letter included that Mr Morgan did not think a scheme of arrangement was
necessary
as had been confirmed by Mr Heydon, and the alternatives
Mr Morgan identified were a new prospectus (as distinct from a
supplementary
prospectus) and delaying the float.
<P>

1133	The boards of Association and Insurance met jointly on 2 February
1995.  A resolution was passed (Mr Talbot and Ms Singleton
voting
against) which included that the boards supported demutualisation, that
management was authorised "to continue to do all work
necessary in respect of
putting a proposal for restructuring to members", and that management should
prepare a report and recommendations
for the way forward in the light of the
decision of the Full Court.  Miss Fraser supported the resolution, saying that
the objective
"of having a `no' case put to the members" had been achieved, and
withdrew from the Federal Court proceedings.  
<P>

1-134	Mr Talbot's opposition to the restructuring did not abate.  He moved, and
Ms Singleton seconded, that the two of them be constituted
a committee to
obtain advice on recovering damages and costs from Holdings, from directors,
management and staff of Association and
Insurance, and from any other party
responsible for the promotion, preparation and advertising of the prospectus,
and to bring proceedings
if the advice were favourable.  The motion was lost.
Then on 6 February 1994 Mr Talbot filed a notice of motion in the Federal Court
proceedings seeking leave to amend the proceedings, not just in the respects
the subject of the opinion of 23 December 1994 but in
many other respects
involving orders restraining continuance with the proposal, joinder of some of
the NRMA directors, and claims
for damages against the directors.  This was
indeed escalation of the hostilities, and the condition of legal aid seems to
have been
put aside.
<P>

1135	Mr Bateman was asked to indicate his view as to the way forward, and
in a letter to Ms Conway dated 6 February 1995 he said
that he
thought the preparation of a supplementary prospectus as soon as possible was
the preferred course.  He briefly reviewed
possible difficulties, and expressed
the view that a revision of the existing prospectus was the second option.
<P>

1136	The NRMA selected ME as the solicitors for further work on the
restructuring, at that time leaving undecided whether it would
also continue
with AAH and AT;  however, the board management liaison committee, a group
established in December 1994 with the function
indicated by its name, resolved
to obtain legal advice on whether AAH and AT had been negligent.  Mr Paul
Mazoudier, Mr Peter Kuner,
and Professor Robert Austin of ME provided
advice to a management committee constituted by the NRMA to prepare a report
and recommendations
in accordance with the resolution of 2 February 1995.
In the result, ME itself provided the report and recommendations by a report
to
the boards of Association and Insurance dated 21 February 1995.  
<P>

1137	ME recommended that the boards commission an independent expert's report
on the reasons for and against demutualisation, on
whether it was advisable in
the interests of Association and Insurance and their respective members, and on
whether the proposals
in the prospectus were fair and reasonable as regards
Association and Insurance and their respective members and the reasons for
that
opinion.  It was said that the independent expert's report should consider
whether there was any obvious alternative which should
be preferred, that
management should be authorised to take steps to preserve the existing options
pending the boards' reconsideration,
and that the boards should reconsider
their decisions with respect to demutualisation after the receipt of the
independent expert's
report.  
<P>

1138	Essentially, the reasoning was that in the events which had happened it
was desirable that there be full and genuine reconsideration
of the entire
demutualisation process.  If it were decided to proceed, ME considered that the
most viable alternative was to continue
with the proposals in the existing
prospectus, reviving the adjourned meetings either with a supplementary
prospectus or with a new
prospectus, preferring that course to undertaking a
scheme of arrangement.  The advantages and disadvantages of each alternative
were summarised.  Perhaps curiously in the light of the earlier submission, in
relation to a scheme of arrangement the stated disadvantages
did not mention
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, save so far as that might have been involved in the
observation that if the court were to identify small groups of members as
separate
classes "those small groups would have a power of veto over the
proposal whatever the wishes of the majority of members as a whole".
 But as
will appear, outside the report the NRMA was told of concern over the appeal in
<i>Gambotto's case.</i>
<P>

1139<i>	</i>The ME report of 21 February 1995 was presented to a joint meeting
of the boards of Association and Insurance on 23 February 1995.
 Mr
Mazoudier, Mr Kuner, and Professor Austin spoke to it.  It was resolved that a
committee be formed to consider the submissions
(which had already been
received) for the preparation of an independent expert's report, and to provide
its recommendations to the
resumed meeting on 27 February 1995.  At the
resumed meeting the appointment of Grant Samuel &amp; Associates Pty Ltd
("Grant Samuel")
was recommended, and it was resolved that it be commissioned
to provide the independent expert's report and otherwise in accordance
with the
suggestions in the ME report.
<P>

1140	Mr Talbot's notice of motion in the Federal Court proceedings was heard in
late February 1994.  It was unsuccessful, in that
Gummow J thought that Mr
Talbot should bring fresh proceedings rather than amend in the existing
proceedings.  
<P>

1141	At the meeting of 23 February 1995 Mr Talbot moved that Association
commence proceedings in the Federal Court, under instructions
from himself, Ms
Singleton, and one other board appointee, claiming extensive declaratory and
other relief.  The relief included
declarations "as to whether the
reconstruction as proposed can proceed without a scheme of arrangement and
approval by the Court",
"as to whether the reconstruction and share issue in
the form proposed contravenes the provisions of the Corporations Law with
particular
reference to s 185 of that Law", as to whether the directors of
Holdings breached their fiduciary and other duties as directors of
Association
or Insurance in relation to the proposal and its implementation, as to
contravention of s 52  of the TP Act and the Law
"in the advertising
and/or the public relations and media campaign for or in relation to the
proposed reconstruction, share issue,
public float and Prospectus".  It also
included the recovery of damages from Holdings, its directors, and the
directors and officers
of Association and Insurance.  
<P>

1142	The motion was accepted without a seconder, and it was resolved (over the
dissent of Mr Talbot) that it lie on the table until
27 February 1994.  On that
day it was resolved (again over the dissent of Mr Talbot) that the motion
continue to lie on the table.
 But by then Mr Talbot had brought fresh
proceedings in the Federal Court, as a derivative action against Association,
Insurance,
Holdings and their directors.  The determination to oppose the
restructuring was still evident.
<P>

1143	Although the ME report of 21 February 1994 did not refer to <i>Gambotto's
case</i> as posing a risk to the proposal, according to Mr Mackay in late
February or early March 1995 Professor Austin told him of the outstanding
High
Court appeal and "alerted me to the fact that, if the decision went in favour
of Gambotto, it might present a problem".  Mr
Easson gave general evidence of
being told by ME shortly before the High Court decision was given that the High
Court might, in considering
the then reserved <i>Gambotto case</i>, reconsider
the area of law involving oppression.  Mr Burrows, on the other hand, gave
evidence that he attended two meetings with
Professor Austin concerning a
supplementary prospectus, and that nothing was said about <i>Gambotto's
case</i> as a case the decision in which might render the proposal unlawful.
Given the content of the ME submission, it is likely that Professor
Austin
would have spoken to Mr Mackay to the effect he recalled, and to others, and I
accept that he did.  
<P>

1144	This may be the source of the recollections of Dr Werner and Mr Lawson
earlier noted.  The concern can not have been regarded
as major, or it would
have been found in the ME report of 21 February 1994 and ME would not have
considered resolutions in general
meetings the most viable alternative.  But ME
was watching <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and awareness that the resolutions in
general meetings route might be open to challenge underlay the first
declaration proposed
by Mr Talbot.  
<P>

1145	The remainder of the original Federal Court proceedings was dismissed by
Gummow J on 2 March 1994, over the opposition of Mr
Talbot:  presumably his
Honour considered that there was no point in having the remaining issues
decided.  Mr Talbot's fresh derivative
proceedings remained on foot.
<P>

<b>After the decision of the High Court </b>
<P>

1146	The High Court delivered judgment on 8 March 1995.  The decision was
immediately seen as an obstacle to the proposal as then
under way.
<P>

1147	The record (it is probably not accurate to call it minutes) of a meeting
on 9 March 1995 of the board management liaison committee
included -
<P>

"<b>1.  Update from Gambotto judgment</b>
<P>

Bob Austin distributed an initial report on the Gambotto ruling which went 5-0
in Gambotto's favour. This has fundamental implications
for our demutualisation
proposal relating to the claim of oppression and compulsion.  Minter Ellison
and Arthur Emmett QC have reviewed
the judgement and, although final written
confirmation is sought from Emmett, Minter Ellison's feeling is that to proceed
with our
current proposal would be `risky and foolhardy'.
<P>

Minter Ellison's recommendation is to cease all work related to either a
supplementary prospectus or a new prospectus for the current
proposal.
<P>

<b>The Committee accepted this recommendation.</b>
<P>

In light of this decision, the Grant Samuel brief may require some addition to
accommodate the ruling.
<P>

<b>Action: Minter Ellison to review the brief and propose amendment.</b>"
<P>

The initial report presented by Professor Austin read -
<P>

<center>"REPORT TO THE BOARD MANAGEMENT LIAISON COMMITTEE
<P>

CANCELLATION OF MEMBERS' RIGHTS - THE OPPRESSION ARGUMENT</center>
<P>


<P>

An integral part of the demutualisation proposal contained in the 1994
prospectus was that all members of the Association and Insurance
would cease to
be members upon implementation of the proposal, on condition that they were
offered shares in Holdings or the cash
alternative.
<P>

The compulsory aspect of the demutualisation proposal was to be achieved by
provisions in the new articles of association of the
two companies, which were
to be adopted by special resolution of the members.
<P>

The prospectus said (page 12):
<P>

`The special resolutions (if passed) constitute an agreement which binds all
members of the Association and NRMA Insurance, even
if they voted against the
proposal or did not vote at all.'
<P>

As we have indicated previously, there is a legal issue as to whether an
amendment to articles of association of a company which
compulsorily
extinguishes membership against the wishes of a member is necessarily
oppressive and therefore invalid.
<P>

The decision of the High Court in <i>WCP Limited v Gambotto</i> was delivered
on 8 March 1995. In that case the articles of association of WCP were amended
to permit the 99.7% shareholder to acquire
compulsorily the remaining 0.3% of
the company's shares for a price which was acknowledged to be more than fair.
Mr Gambotto objected
to the compulsory acquisition. The High Court held that
the amendment to the articles was invalid.
<P>

In the view of Chief Justice Mason and Justices Brennan, Deane and Dawson, who
delivered a joint judgment, an amendment which expropriates
the proprietary
rights of a member is invalid unless those who assert its validity can prove
that -
<P>

*	the amendment was made for a proper purpose, and
<P>

*	the expropriation will not operate oppressively or unfairly to minority
shareholders.
<P>

An expropriation may be justified `where it is reasonably apprehended that the
continued shareholding of the minority is detrimental
to the company' (at 11) -
for example, where the minority shareholder is completing with the company, or
where the company is a television
licensee and the minority shareholder is a
foreign shareholder whose continued holding may prejudice the company's
licence:
<P>

`but that is not to say that the majority can expropriate the minority merely
in order to secure for themselves the benefit of the
corporate structure that
can derive some new commercial advantage by virtue of the expropriation' (at
11).
<P>

Obviously the demutualisation proposal is factually distinguished from
<i>Gambotto's case</i> in several respects. The demutualisation proposal would
compulsorily extinguish the rights of all members, including those who vote
in
favour of the new articles. Moreover, there are important differences between
shareholding and membership of a company limited
by guarantee. It is not clear,
even after the Full Court's judgment in the <i>NRMA case</i>, whether the
rights of a member of a company limited by guarantee are properly described as
`proprietary rights'.
<P>

Nevertheless, our provisional opinion is that the basic reasoning of the
<i>Gambotto case</i> is applicable to the demutualisation proposal. The
majority voting in favour of the proposal would be doing so in order to secure
for themselves the benefit of a corporate structure that can derive a new
commercial advantage. It could not be said that the continued
shareholding of
the minority is detrimental to the company.
<P>

Yesterday afternoon we consulted Mr Arthur Emmett QC who agrees with our
provisional view. It will be necessary to obtain written
advice from Senior
Counsel as soon as practicable.
<P>

If our provisional view is correct, the implication seems to be that it will be
impossible to proceed with the supplementary prospectus,
or with a new
prospectus to implement the current demutualisation proposal. The alternatives
will be either:
<P>

*	a scheme of arrangement; or
<P>

*	a proposal in which members will have a choice between retaining
<P>

their existing membership rights or taking shares."
<P>

1148	It will be seen that the initial report said that ME had "indicated
previously" a legal issue as to whether compulsory extinguishment
of membership
by amendment to articles was "necessarily oppressive and therefore invalid".
This supports the conclusion that Professor
Austin had earlier told Mr Mackay,
and others, that a decision in favour of Mr Gambotto might present a problem.

<P>

1149	Accordingly to the initial report, the concern in relation to the proposal
was that compulsory extinguishment of membership
might be "necessarily
oppressive", a concise way of expressing of the observations much earlier in
these reasons that McLelland J
in <i>Gambotto's case</i> seems to have thought
that the fact of expropriation was enough to constitute oppression, but in the
view of the Court of Appeal
if the expropriation was fair the fact of
expropriation would not invalidate the exercise of the power to change the
articles.  The
High Court did not decide that an expropriation of shares was
necessarily oppressive, but, to repeat what I said also much earlier
in these
reasons, held that the fact of expropriation would make the exercise of the
power invalid, even if the expropriation was
fair (which was equated with not
oppressive), unless the majority shareholders could prove a proper purpose.

<P>

1150	Professor Austin's reaction to the decision of the High Court was
matched by that of Mr Bateman.  It seems of his own initiative,
by a
letter dated 10 March 1995 he sent to Ms Conway for her information a
copy of the judgment, saying -
<P>

"The reasoning of the High Court has implications for any restructuring of NRMA
Limited and/or NRMA Insurance Limited.  While the
Judgment is framed in terms
of a majority expropriating the shares of a minority, it can also be viewed, on
one interpretation, as
also dealing with the expropriation of the rights of a
minority regardless of the fact that the majority do not acquire those
rights."
<P>

1151	Professor Austin did obtain the written advice of senior counsel, as
it happened Mr Heydon.  Mr Heydon provided an opinion
dated
13 March 1995.  
<P>

1152	He recorded as the subject of his advice whether the special resolutions
proposed by the NRMA for the adoption of new articles
of association to
implement the 1994 demutualisation proposal would be valid, if adopted, having
regard to the decision of the High
Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  He
outlined the effect of the special resolutions, summarising it as termination
of the membership rights which members of Association
and Insurance possessed
until that time.  He first considered whether the reasoning in <i>Gambotto's
case</i> was inapplicable to companies limited by guarantee, and after
discussion concluded that it was not.  
<P>

1153	Mr Heydon then asked whether the reasoning applied adversely to the
validity of the proposal, and said -
<P>

"The two questions which the High Court says any majority must demonstrate to
be capable only of an affirmative answer are, first,
whether the purpose is to
secure the company from significant detriment or harm and, secondly, whether
the alteration to the articles
is `fair' ie not oppressive.
<P>

As to the first question, the minority in the present circumstances are not
analogous to competitors or foreign shareholders preventing
the company from
obtaining or retaining an advantage. <i> Gambotto's case</i> (in the view of
the majority though not that of McHugh J) excludes the capacity of a company to
rely on tax advantages by grouping
and administrative benefits as a
justification for expropriating minorities.  Those advantages are real
advantages to the company
and to the majority, but they do not appear to be
different in character, so far as the present problem is concerned, from the
benefits
summarised on page 6 of the prospectus.  The High Court specifically
said that the majority cannot expropriate the minority `in order
to secure for
themselves the benefit of a corporate structure that can derive some new
commercial advantage'.  It also forbade expropriation
` where it would advance
the interests of the company as a legal or commercial entity or those of the
general body of corporators'.
<P>

If the first question were not answered affirmatively, the second would not
arise.  Even if the first question were answered affirmatively,
the second
would seem to call for a disclosure of `all relevant information leading up to
the alteration' (which incidentally may
create a collision with what the Full
Federal Court said in <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20ATPR%2041%2d374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) ATPR 41-374</a>
at 40,144) as well as valuation by an independent expert (which, according to
the Full Federal Court in <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20ATPR%2041%2d374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) ATPR
41-374</a> at 40,157 `may be impossible').  These are heavy burdens.  The High
Court left open the question of whether the majority should abstain
from
voting;  an answer that they should would be fatal so far as the present
enterprise is concerned.
<P>

The answer to the question is accordingly that there seems to be at least a
significant likelihood that the special resolutions
would not be valid having
regard to the decision of the High Court in <i>WCP Limited v Gambotto</i>. They
would appear to be capable of validation only if some reason for the
demutualisation of which I am unaware is capable of being
identified and is
capable of being characterised as falling within the permissible purposes
stated by the High Court in that case."
<P>

1154	This opinion was not definitive.  It was rather obscure as to fairness or
oppression, and while focussing on proper purpose
did not clearly address the
NRMA's purpose and its propriety.  No doubt that was why, from an account in a
later letter from ME to
Ms Conway, Mr Heydon was then asked to advise
whether, having regard to the text of the prospectus, any reason had been
identified
falling within the permissible purposes stated by the High Court.

<P>

1155	On 15 March 1995 Mr Heydon advised in conference that he had
reviewed the prospectus and had not identified any reason for
the
demutualisation which would serve to distinguish the facts from those in
<i>Gambotto's case</i>.  According to the account in the letter, "In
particular, purposes relating to unlocking the wealth of the organisations,
stabilising
their Boards and corporate governance, and improving the `financial
engineering' of the companies would not fall within the permissible
purposes
stated by the High Court in that case."  
<P>

1156	Mr Heydon's advices were reported to the board management liaison
committee on 21 March 1995.  Some members of the committee
expressed
reservations about the advices, and Mr Easson prepared a paper the thrust
of which was that there could be a demutualisation
as proposed consistently
with <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  
<P>

1157	ME was asked to obtain further advice, and briefed Mr S
E K Hulme QC.  Mr Hulme was asked the same question as had initially
been asked of Mr Heydon.  In a telephone conversation with
Professor Austin on 23 March 1994 Mr Hulme advised, as recorded
by Professor
Austin, "that in your view, the <i>Gambotto </i>case would pose a
problem if our clients were to proceed with the special resolutions proposed
last year".  Professor Austin told
Mr Hulme that a written opinion would not be
required.
<P>

1158	Mr Hulme was then asked, by a letter from ME dated 26 March 1995, to
consider three related or consequential questions, probably
as a result of Mr
Easson's paper.  
<P>

1159	The first question was whether special resolutions along the lines of the
1994 proposal would be valid if adopted for certain
purposes which had been
identified as reasons for demutualisation in the paper, some of the reasons not
being expressly stated in
the prospectus.  The reasons were to the effect that
the NRMA had to expand its business and improve its competitive position, by
increasing its ownership base and its market beyond New South Wales and
defeating the medium to long term threat of other organisations;
 that the NRMA
had to improve its corporate governance to remove exposure to populism and
ensure the skills required to manage its
business;  and that the NRMA's surplus
capital had to be made available to members;  all of which called for change
from a mutual
structure to the structure of a listed entity.  
<P>

1160	The second question was whether, as suggested by Mr Easson, there
were sufficient points of distinction between the circumstances
of the NRMA and
<i>Gambotto's case</i> that a new proposal which would by amendment to the
articles extinguish the membership of members of Association and Insurance in
exchange for shares or a cash alternative "would avoid the <i>Gambotto</i>
principle".  
<P>

1161	The third question was whether a procedure under which membership of
Association and Insurance was not extinguished, but the
voting rights of
members was curtailed so that Holdings would be the sole voting member of
Association and Insurance, if implemented
by amendment to the articles of
association of Association and Insurance without a scheme of arrangement,
"would attract the principle
in <i>Gambotto</i>".
<P>

1162	Mr Hulme provided two opinions dated 3 April 1995.  Although he
had been relieved of the need to provide a written opinion,
the first opinion
seems to have addressed the question on which he had orally advised on 23 March
1995.  
<P>

1163	Mr Hulme was clearly not enamoured of the manner in which the
judgments of the High Court were expressed.  But he said in the
first opinion
that if what was to happen constituted the expropriation of a minority, then
<i>Gambotto's case</i> was obviously significant because the attainment of the
purposes expressed in the prospectus did not justify an amendment introducing
a
power not previously there to expropriate the minority.  In Mr Hulme's
view, there would be a compulsory loss of a position seen
as being, and being,
a valuable one, and that would be an expropriation.  Mr Hulme
concluded -
<P>

"15.	Accordingly I am of opinion that what is to be done does constitute
expropriation; that the decision in <i>Gambotto</i> is likely to stand in its
way; that no court lower in the hierarchy is likely to accept an argument
distinguishing this case from
<i>Gambotto</i>; and that the chances of the High
Court wishing to do so are low.
<P>

16.	In that last regard it may be noted that the judgment said little as to
expropriation occurring via schemes of arrangement,
reconstructions etc. But at
T 12 the judgment does say that to allow expropriation wherever commercial
advantage could be shown (cf
passages f and g in para 9 above) would
`circumvent the protection which the Corporations Law gives to minorities who
resist compromises,
amalgamations and reconstructions, schemes of arrangement
and takeover offers'. It appears then that what has been said is not intended
to stand in the way of expropriation seen as proper by a court-approved scheme
of arrangement. That I fancy means that the High Court
would be more likely to
expand <i>Gambotto</i> than restrict it, leaving those still wishing to proceed
to do so via the method which gives the acquired person the protection of
the
courts."
<P>

1164	The second opinion addressed the three further questions posed in the
letter of 26 March 1995.  As to the first question, Mr
Hulme expressed the
view that the purposes identified in Mr Easson's paper took the matter no
further, and that "the Easson reasons
give no reason to alter the views I have
previously expressed".  As to the second question, Mr Hulme considered the
points of distinction
between the circumstances of the NRMA and <i>Gambotto's
case</i> which had been identified by Mr Easson, and expressed the view
that the NRMA's circumstances were not "sufficiently distinguishable
to enable
a proposal for amendment of the articles to extinguish the memberships to be
drawn in such manner as to avoid <i>Gambotto</i>".  As to the third question,
Mr Hulme said that depriving members of the right to vote was
expropriation for the purposes of <i>Gambotto's case</i>, the right to vote
being one of the bundle of rights enjoyed by a shareholder, and that there was
no difference of principle between
taking all the rights and taking some of
them and that a right to vote had a value.  Mr Hulme concluded this
opinion -
<P>

"11.	The central fact, as I see it, is that having taken a stand of the kind it
did in <i>Gambotto</i>, the High Court is not lightly going to let parties find
ways to circumvent it. As one considers the various alternatives to the
original proposal, one finds <i>Gambotto</i> lying in wait. Increasingly I feel
forced to the view that the courts will force the matter into the form of
scheme of arrangement."
<P>

1165	This was a powerful body of advice that <i>Gambotto's case</i> precluded
implementing the demutualisation through special resolutions at meetings of
members.  In these proceedings the NRMA submitted
that in fact it did not do
so, but the NRMA could hardly be expected to have acted contrary to the body of
advice it was receiving;
 and it did not blindly succumb to one opinion, but
questioned the advice it was receiving and was given confirmatory advice.
<P>

1166	ME provided a draft further report dated 29 March 1995 addressed to
the boards of Association and Insurance, prior to the written
opinions of Mr
Hulme.  The draft report concluded that it was no longer feasible to revive the
meetings which had been convened and
adjourned in 1994, or to issue a
supplementary prospectus, and that the only feasible alternatives were
demutualisation by scheme
of arrangement, demutualisation by Act of Parliament,
or some form of demutualisation on a "non-compulsory" basis in which members
could choose to retain their existing memberships.  
<P>

1167	There was detailed reasoning in the report, significant in which was that
the decision of the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i> spelt the end of the
meetings.  After reference to the reasons of the High Court, and recital of the
written and oral advice received
from Mr Heydon and the oral advice received
from Mr Hulme, it was said -
<P>

"3.12	Counsels' advice on the implications of the <i>Gambotto</i> case has the
effect that the adjourned meetings should be abandoned, because:-
<P>

*	the resolutions of which notice was given would be invalid in some respects,
according to Counsel;
<P>

*	under s 253 of the Corporations Law, as interpreted by case law, a special
resolution moved at a meeting cannot be substantially
different from the
resolution of which notice has been given;
<P>

*	consequently, it would not be permissible to amend at the adjourned meetings
the special resolutions proposed by the 1994 prospectus
in order to remove
their invalidating components;
<P>

*	nor would it be permissible to issue amended notices of resolution, as the
amended resolutions  would be so substantially different
from the original
resolutions that they could not be treated as mere amendments;
<P>

*	therefore the meetings cannot be kept alive if the resolutions are amended to
avoid the <i>Gambotto</i> principles.
<P>

(It follows, incidentally, that the strategy of reviving the adjourned meetings
while issuing a new prospectus is necessarily excluded.)
<P>

3.13	The only question which remains is whether a supplementary prospectus can
be lodged together with notices convening new meetings
which would avoid the
invalidating effects of the <u>Gambotto</u> case. To avoid the <u>Gambotto</u>
principle, the new resolutions must either:
<P>

*	avoid extinguishing the membership rights of members who oppose the proposal
or do nothing (that is, a `non-compulsory' proposal);
or
<P>

*	extinguish membership rights in the context of a court-approved scheme of
arrangement.
<P>

3.14	In either event, the resolutions would need to be substantially different
from those contained in the 1994 prospectus.
<P>

3.15	The 1994 prospectus is governed by the Corporations Law as in force prior
to amendments which commence on 5 September 1994.
At that time s 1024
of the Corporations Law provided for the lodgment of a supplementary prospectus
in cases of `significant change'
affecting a matter contained in the prospectus
and in cases where a `significant new matter' arose after the lodgment of the
prospectus.
Section 1033(7) provided for the lodgment of a supplementary
prospectus after the Commission had issued a stop order because of a
defect in
the original prospectus. Clearly the circumstances in which a supplementary
prospectus could be lodged were limited. Nevertheless,
in ASC Practice Note 45
the ASC took a broad interpretation of these provisions, contemplating that a
company which discovers a deficiency
in a prospectus may lodge a supplementary
prospectus to overcome the defect, or significant new matter, and no stop order
has been
issued.
<P>

3.16	However, notwithstanding this broad interpretation, the ASC expressed the
view in Practice Note 45 that there are limits to
what may be achieved by a
supplementary prospectus. According to the ASC:
<P>

`s 1024 provides a person who has lodged a prospectus with an avenue to issue
additional material connected with the offer or invitation
but ... it does not
allow the use of a supplementary prospectus to make a different offer or
invitation.'
<P>

3.17	In our opinion, if the proposed resolutions are altered to overcome the
<i>Gambotto</i> principle, either by removing their compulsory aspect or by
proposing a scheme of arrangement, the offer of shares would be seen
by the ASC
as a new offer and the ASC would not permit the companies to proceed by
supplementary prospectus. As a matter of law,
the alteration could not be
regarded as a `significant change' or a `significant new matter' and
consequently a supplementary prospectus
would not strictly be authorised by
s 1024.
<P>

3.18	In all the circumstances, therefore, our advice is that in light of the
<i>Gambotto</i> decision and the opinions of Counsel, it is now no longer
possible to proceed by way of supplementary prospectus, even with newly
convened meetings."
<P>

1168	This advice could only have been reinforced by Mr Hulme's written opinions
of 3 April 1995.
<P>

1169	Before the joint board meeting on 3 April 1995, there was provided to the
NRMA an opinion of Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri concerning
<i>Gambotto's case</i> obtained by Mr Talbot.  With detailed reasons
following, the subject of the opinion and the conclusions were
expressed -
<P>

"<u>1.	W</u>e have been asked to provide our opinion to Mr Richard Talbot, a
Director of NRMA Limited, as to the effect of the decisions of the
High Court
of Australia in<cite> </cite><i>Gambotto v WCP Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20127%20ALR%20417" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 127 ALR 417</a> and
of the Federal Court of Australia in <i>Fraser &amp; Talbot v NRMA &amp;
Others</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1397.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1397</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20124%20ALR%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 124 ALR 548</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20127%20ALR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 127 ALR 543</a> on the proposed
reconstruction and share issue of NRMA Limited and of NRMA Insurance Limited in
the form described in the Prospectus
which was distributed in August and
September 1994 (the `NRMA reconstruction').
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

<u>2.	I</u>n our opinion:
<P>

	<u>2.1	T</u>he NRMA reconstruction in the form proposed or in any form
substantially the same could not be carried out in accordance with law,
in the
light of the decisions of the High Court of Australia in <i>Gambotto's Case</i>
and of the Federal Court of Australia in the <i>NRMA Case</i>.
<P>

	<u>2.2	N</u>o prudent director of NRMA Limited or of NRMA Insurance Limited,
acting with due regard to the duties and obligations of a Director,
could
resolve to proceed with the NRMA reconstruction or with any proposal
substantially to the same effect without obtaining appropriate
declaratory and
other relief from the Federal Court of Australia or other appropriate Court as
to whether the proposed NRMA reconstruction
or other proposal was valid and
effective in law.
<P>

	<u>2.3	I</u>n the light of the decision of the High Court of Australia in
<i>Gambotto's Case</i> it is difficult, and probably impossible, to carry out
any reconstruction of NRMA Limited and of NRMA Insurance Limited involving
the
conversion of those corporations, now corporations limited by guarantee, to
corporations limited by guarantee and a share capital,
so as to achieve
`demutualisation' and the listing of shares on the Australian Stock Exchange,
which would be valid and effective
in law."
<P>

1170	This went further than the ME draft report of 29 March 1995, in that it
suggested that <i>Gambotto's case</i> precluded even the route of a scheme of
arrangement.  Professor Austin did not agree, nor did Mr Hulme.  But the advice
concerning
the resolutions in general meetings route would again have been
reinforced.  More than that, it would have appeared that Mr Talbot
now had, and
would use, an additional weapon in his opposition to the demutualisation, and
would use it to attack not just the proposal
but the directors.
<P>

1171	ME was asked to prepare a short written report for the joint board meeting
of Association and Insurance on 3 April 1995.  It
did so, recounting in
particular the advices which had been received from Mr Heydon and
Mr Hulme and referring to the opinion obtained
by Mr Talbot, and
concluded -
<P>

"12.	In our opinion it is essential for the Boards to make a determination on
the first question which Grant Samuel was instructed
to consider, namely
whether demutualisation is advisable in the interests of the companies and
their respective members, without
being diverted by questions of
implementation. However, it is relevant for the Boards to have our opinion at
this stage as to whether,
if they decide to proceed with a demutualisation
proposal, methods of implementation are available.
<P>

13.	In Mr Hulme's opinion and our own, the <i>Gambotto</i> <i>case</i> does not
prevent the implementation of the substance of the `share the future' proposal
by way of scheme of arrangement. Other possible
methods of demutualisation
would be pursuant to an Act of Parliament or by means of a proposal which would
not compulsorily extinguish
memberships. These matters will be fully addressed
in our further report."
<P>

1172	The reference to Grant Samuel recalls the appointment of Grant Samuel on
27 February 1995, before the decision of the High
Court, to provide an
independent expert's report.  There was a particular issue in the proceedings
over the cost of distributing
the Grant Samuel report to NRMA members and
engaging in a consequential process of consultation.  
<P>

1173	The Grant Samuel report dated 29 March 1995 had become available on
that day, and both it and the ME draft report of that date
came before the
steering committee in anticipation of the joint board meeting appointed for 3
April 1995.  The Grant Samuel report
was in favour of demutualisation.  It came
to the conclusions that demutualisation was in the best interests of
Association and Insurance
and their respective members, that the proposal set
out in the prospectus was fair and reasonable as regards Association, Insurance
and their respective members, and that alternative restructuring proposals that
would achieve a better outcome had not been identified.
 The report went into
great detail.  It did not address how to achieve the restructuring, that is, by
special resolutions, scheme
of arrangement, or in some other way.
<P>

1174	The Grant Samuel report and the ME letter of 3 April 1995 were
amongst the documents tabled at the joint board meeting on 3
April 1995.  The
ME draft report of 29 March 1995 was not in final form, and does not seem to
have been formally tabled.  Each of
the Grant Samuel report and the letter was
spoken to.  Mr Talbot took issue with the Grant Samuel report on a number of
grounds,
said to have the support of his solicitors and counsel, broadly to the
effect that <i>Gambotto's case </i>made it impossible for Grant Samuel to
conclude that the proposed demutualisation was in the interests of members and
fair and reasonable.
 
<P>

1175	It was resolved, Mr Talbot dissenting and Ms Singleton and Dr Vanderfield
abstaining, that there be consultation to obtain
the views of members, staff
and the broader community before taking such steps as might be necessary to
enable members to determine
whether the NRMA should or should not demutualise.
Amongst other things expenditure of up to $680,000 for the purposes of the
consultation,
including the costs of printing and postage of the Grant Samuel
report, public meetings, and advertising, was authorised.  Board
meetings were
appointed for 27 May 1995 "to consider demutualisation in the light of the
Grant Samuel report, the outcome of the
consultation and such other information
as may be appropriate".
<P>

1176	The Grant Samuel report was distributed to all NRMA members, with a
covering letter which drew attention to <i>Gambotto's case</i> as possibly
affecting implementation of a demutualisation but said that the question of
methods of implementation was one for the
future.  To appreciate the NRMA's
purpose as revealed by the letter, it should be set out -
<P>

"I enclose a copy of the report by Grant Samuel &amp; Associates Pty Limited
dated 29 March 1995.  The directors would welcome your
views on the report.  If
you wish to make written comments, please do so by 15 May 1995.
<P>

To assist you in considering the report, I would like to explain our purpose in
making the report available to members, and to provide
you with some background
information.
<P>

The NRMA and NRMA Insurance are presently mutual associations in which each
member has a single vote and no shares have been issued.
 Grant Samuel were
commissioned by the directors to report on proposals to `demutualise' these
companies.  `Demutualisation' refers
to any process by which members of a
mutual association become shareholders.  Normally the shares are quoted on the
stock exchange.
<P>

At their meetings on 3 April 1995, the directors of the two companies discussed
the Grant Samuel report and resolved to seek the
views of the members and the
broader community before deciding whether to take any further steps towards
demutualisation.  There
will be a process of consultation with members during
the period to 15 May 1995, and then the directors will meet again to consider,
in the light of members' comments, whether to proceed with any form of
demutualisation of the NRMA group.
<P>

If they decide to proceed, the directors will then have to consider two further
issues.
<P>

The first is how to calculate members' entitlements to shares.  Please note
that, since no decision has been taken on this point,
we are not in a position
to answer members' questions about entitlements to shares or cash at this
stage.  The other issue is to
choose the most appropriate method of
implementation of the proposal.  Some comment is needed on this last issue.
<P>

It has been said that a recent decision of the High Court of Australia, the
<i>Gambotto</i> case, makes it impossible for the directors to proceed with
demutualisation of the companies.  The companies' lawyers believe that
this is
not so.  Gambotto's case strictly limited the circumstances in which the
members of a company may amend its articles of association
to extinguish
minority memberships.  It does not deal with the implementation of a proposal
for demutualisation by other means, such
as a court-approved scheme of
arrangement.  But the question of methods of implementation is one for the
future.
<P>

This is only the first stage of a process of consultation.  Members will be
further consulted on issues to do with implementation
if the directors decide
in favour of a demutualisation proposal.  In that event, a concrete proposal
will be put to members with
full and adequate explanation, and members will
have the opportunity to vote for or against that proposal.
<P>

You are not asked to make any decisions or cast any votes at this stage.  You
are simply invited to express any views which you
may have on any aspect of
demutualisation, including matters raised in the Grant Samuel report and any
relevant matters which you
think the report should have covered but has not.
<P>

This is not a poll or ballot.  Nor is it an offer or invitation to take up
shares.  As members are aware, when demutualisation was
proposed in 1994, a
prospectus was issued to members, but when the Federal Court found that the
prospectus was misleading or deceptive,
the demutualisation process was
halted.
<P>

<b>In summary, the directors of the NRMA and NRMA Insurance invite you to
consider the Grant Samuel report and then, if you wish, make
written comments
by 15 May 1995.  Please address your comments to:</b>

<b>GPO Sydney  NSW 2001</b>
<P>

Whatever may be decided, the directors wish to ensure that members are given an
adequate opportunity to express their views."
<P>

1177	The point was expressed by Mr Mackay by his evidence that "The members
were in a very confused state:  was demutualisation
a good or a bad thing?  Why
had it failed?  We wanted to allay some of their fears."  And he still thought
demutualisation was in
the bests interests of the NRMA.
<P>

1178	Advertisements were placed, public consultation meetings were held, and
market research was undertaken.  Mr Talbot's threatened
proceedings to restrain
the distribution of the Grant Samuel report did not eventuate, but he moved
for, and was granted, leave to
amend the existing (fresh) Federal Court
proceedings to include a claim that the consultation process was misleading
conduct.
<P>

1179	At the joint meeting of the boards of Association and Insurance on
27 May 1995 there were presented a report on the public
consultation
meetings, a report on the written "feedback" received by the NRMA, and a report
from ME entitled "Status of the 1994
Proposals".  
<P>

1180	The first two reports were to the effect that the membership was negative
and a 75% vote of members in favour of demutualisation
was unlikely.  The third
report concluded -
<P>

"12.	In summary, on the basis of legal advice the position is that it is not
feasible to 
<P>

*	proceed with the meetings convened and adjourned in 1994;  or
<P>

*	issue a supplementary prospectus,
<P>

	having regard to the impact of the decision in the <i>Gambotto </i>case and
all other relevant circumstances.
<P>

13.	It therefore seems appropriate for the Boards to resolve that the 1994
meetings and prospectus should be abandoned, while leaving
open the question
whether similar proposals should be put forward by convening new meetings and
issuing a new prospectus, or by proceeding
in some other way, in the
future."
<P>

1181	The Grant Samuel report was further considered so far as it concerned
reasons for demutualisation, reasons against demutualisation,
and alternative
approaches to demutualisation.  A further ME report, described as "Options For
The Way Forward", was noted and discussed,
as was a report concerning corporate
governance.  The former report posed, without recommendation of any one of
them, four "broad
options" for consideration, namely -
<P>

"(a)	do nothing;
<P>

(b)	defer going to members to change structure until after 1995 AGM and
elections;
<P>

(c)	ask management to develop for the Boards' consideration a concept document
which addresses the concerns coming out of the consultation
and the key
outcomes of the Independent Expert's Report;
<P>

(d)	implement essentially the 1994 proposal to demutualise by `mandatory'
scheme of arrangement."
<P>

1182	The meeting was lengthy, extending over eight hours.  The minutes
recorded -
<P>

"Professor R Austin of Minter Ellison presented a report on the Status of the
1994 Proposals.
<P>

After discussion, it was resolved that, having regard to the matters outlined
in the report entitled `Status of the 1994 Proposals'
prepared by Minter
Ellison and dated 24 May 1995, the October 1994 meeting and prospectus not be
proceeded with."
<P>

1183	Later the minutes recorded -
<P>

"Having considered the views of Professor R Austin on Proper Corporate
Purposes, the Board resolved that it reconfirms its decision
to propose to
members a re-structuring of the company in order to achieve a widely-based
service-oriented organisation for the reasons
set out in the independent
expert's report by Grant Samuel &amp; Associates Pty Limited, dated 29 March
1995.
<P>

Ms FJ Singleton and Mr RJ Talbot voted against the motion.
<P>

The Board further resolved to request management to develop for the Board
within three months a concept document to address the
concerns coming out of
the consultation process and the key concepts of the independent expert's
report.
<P>

Ms FJ Singleton and Mr RJ Talbot voted against the motion.
<P>

The Board further resolved that any proposal subsequently adopted in principle
be fully communicated to members and they have ample
opportunity to consider
and comment on it before implementation.
<P>

Mr RJ Talbot abstained from voting."
<P>

1184	So the proposal, at least the proposal as reflected in the prospectus,
came to an end, but with the majority on the boards
still in favour of
restructuring the NRMA.  In a manner which it is unnecessary to describe, Mr
Talbot's fresh Federal Court proceedings,
which had been progressing with some
vigour, were then terminated.  
<P>

<center><b>VII  GAMBOTTO LIABILITY</b></center>
<P>

1185	The NRMA's case, as summarised in submissions, was that it should have
been advised by the defendants that <i>Gambotto's case</i> was on appeal to the
High Court and, after 10 December 1993, that the appeal had reasonable
prospects of success and there was a
real risk that the High Court's decision
might adversely impact upon the proposal;  had that advice been given, the
boards would
have voted to stop or slow down the proposal and much, if not all,
of the expenditure later incurred would have been avoided.  The
preferred date
by which the advice should have been given and would have been acted on was 17
March 1994, when the proposal was put
before the boards.  The fall-back date
was 28 April 1994, the date of the first board meetings after the hearing of
the appeal. 

<P>

1186	If Gambotto liability be found, the NRMA's damages would be at most that
part of the wasted expenditure incurred after 17 March
1994 or 28 April 1994,
rather than the entire wasted expenditure.  At one point in the course of the
hearing the NRMA said that it
would be necessary to consider free
shares/disadvantages liability only if there was not Gambotto liability, but it
became evident
that this was incorrect.  Damages in relation to the wasted
expenditure incurred after 17 March 1994 or 28 April 1994 would pick
up the
majority of the wasted expenditure, but it would still be necessary to consider
free shares/disadvantages liability because
the NRMA's claims there extended to
earlier expenditure as wasted expenditure.  
<P>

1187	A number of the defendants' defences would not apply to Gambotto
liability.  It is desirable to repeat what I earlier said,
that not all the
facts described are of great moment in my decision of these proceedings.  What
follows takes up the matters leading
to my conclusions on Gambotto liability by
general rather than detailed reference to the facts I have described, but in
the light
of all the facts.
<P>

1188	In accordance with the earlier description of the claims against the
defendants, save as to contributory negligence it is not
necessary to
distinguish between the claims for negligence and the claims for breach of
contract.  I will deal in turn with negligence,
causation, and defences.
<P>

<b>Negligence</b>
<P>

1189	The defendants were bound to exercise due care, skill and diligence,
bringing to their task the competence and skill usual
amongst solicitors or
barristers (as the case may be) practising their profession and taking proper
care in what they did (<i>Voli v Inglewood Shire Council</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20110%20CLR%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 110 CLR 74</a>

Ch 384</a> at 403).  Each of AAH, AT and Mr Heydon professed to be, and was, expert
in corporations law, and the care, skill and diligence to
be exercised was that
appropriate to a member of the relevant profession having such specialist
expertise (<i>Duchess of Argyll v Beuselinck</i> (1972) 2 LLR 172 at 185;
<i>Rogers v Whitaker</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 479</a> at 483; <i>Yates Property

<i>Montague Mining Pty Ltd v Gare</i> (Wilcox J, 23 October 1998, unreported).

<P>

1190	The obligation was nonetheless one of reasonable care:  "the duty of care
is not a warranty of perfection" (<i>Duchess of Argyll v Beuselinck </i>at 185;
see also cases cited below when noting that negligence by the lawyers does not
automatically follow from the decisions of
Gummow J and the Full Court).  It
was not suggested that Mr Heydon was entitled to the advocate's immunity
considered in <i>Giannarelli v Wraith</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 543.</a> 
<P>

1191	The due care, skill and diligence were to be exercised in doing what the
solicitors were retained or Mr Heydon was briefed
to do.  Because a solicitor's
duty lies in tort as well as contract, it may be that in the particular
circumstances it may require
that the solicitor go beyond the specifically
agreed professional task or function if that is necessary to avoid a real and
foreseeable
risk of economic loss being sustained by the client (<i>Hawkins v
Clayton</i> at 579;  <i>Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne</i> at 652;  <i>Citicorp
Australia Ltd v O'Brien</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 398</a> at 418).  
<P>

1192	In the present case I have no doubt that the retainer of AAH and AT
extended to advice upon the possible risk to the proposal
from the appeal to
the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, if the exercise of due care, skill
and diligence so required, and that the briefs to Mr Heydon similarly required
him to advert
to that risk if the exercise of due care, skill and diligence so
required.  
<P>

1193	As to AAH and AT, they were called upon to advise the NRMA whether the
proposal could and should be implemented by scheme or
meeting, and a risk in
the resolutions in general meetings route was clearly something to which they
should have had regard and of
which they should have informed the NRMA.  As to
Mr Heydon, as a minimum he was asked by the revised brief delivered on 15 or 16
December 1993 to advise "whether there is a legal requirement to proceed by
scheme of arrangement ... or whether it is sufficient
if the necessary
resolutions are passed by members in general meeting".  If a risk to the
proposal because the resolutions would
be "necessarily oppressive" (to take up
Professor Austin's concise expression) should have been seen, reference to the
risk should
have been part of the advice.  In the circumstances, it would not
have been sufficient for AAH, AT, or Mr Heydon simply to advise
that the
proposal could be implemented by the resolutions in general meetings route, if
of that view after weighing arguments for
and against, without informing the
NRMA of a risk forming one of the arguments against.  In the language of the
brief to Mr Heydon,
resolutions in general meetings would not be sufficient,
either as the obverse of a legal requirement to proceed by way of scheme
of
arrangement or as a course for the NRMA to undertake, if there were a risk.

<P>

1195	More widely, the question was whether to proceed by the resolutions in
general meetings route or the scheme of arrangement
route had significant
practical implications, given that opposition to the proposal was expected.
AAH and AT were well aware of this,
and it was made known to Mr Heydon.  This
emphasised, if it were not already evident, that the risk of a necessarily
invalidating
impediment to the resolutions in general meetings route should be
brought to account.
<P>

1196	The NRMA did not call a solicitor or a barrister to give expert evidence
of the practice of solicitors or barristers in the
positions of the defendants,
or of what a solicitor or barrister in the position of the defendants would
have done.  Nor did the
defendants, subject to what I will say about the
evidence of Mr Bennett to which I will shortly refer.  The NRMA drew attention
to
the deprecation of calling such evidence in <i>Midland Bank Trust Co Limited
v Hett Stubbs &amp; Kemp </i>at 402, embraced (after the hearing of these
proceedings began) in <i>Yates Property Corporation (in Liquidation) v
Boland</i> at 55-6.  
<P>

1197	I express no view on whether expert evidence could or should have been
called in the present case:  perhaps it would not have
been easy to identify
areas of practice.  The fact is that, again subject to what I will say about
the evidence of Mr Bennett, there
was no evidence from persons outside the
relevant transactions to assist in giving content to the due care, skill and
diligence required
of the defendants.  It falls to the Court itself to provide
that content (see <i>Negal v Power</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20SASR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) SASR 373</a> at 376;  <i>Fox v

<P>

1198	AAH called Mr Bennett, whose expertise in corporations law and experience
in practice as a barrister were unquestioned, not
to give evidence of practice
but to give evidence of what he, Mr Bennett, would have done and advised if
briefed in December 1993.
 The evidence was led to found a submission as to
causation to the effect that, had Mr Heydon given the Gambotto advice which the
NRMA said should have been given, the NRMA would have asked for a second
opinion, Mr Bennett would have been briefed to advise on
the relevance of
<i>Gambotto's case</i> to the proposal, Mr Bennett's opinion would have allayed
any fears of risk to the proposal in connection with <i>Gambotto's case</i>,
and the NRMA would not have stopped or slowed down the proposal.  Other parties
enlarged Mr Bennett's evidence in cross-examination,
and his evidence even of
what he would have done and advised was inevitably drawn on by the parties, in
different ways, in endeavours
to give content to the due care, skill and
diligence required of the defendants.  
<P>

1199	Mr Bennett's evidence was founded on a brief in fact delivered to him in
July 1998.  The brief provided a copy of the revised
brief delivered to Mr
Heydon on 15 or 16 December 1993, asked that it be assumed (amongst other
things) that Mr Heydon had advised
"without addressing the question of
oppression" that the proposal could be implemented by resolutions in general
meetings, drew attention
to <i>Gambotto's case</i> and the pending appeal to
the High Court, and asked Mr Bennett to advise - 
<P>

(a)	as at January 1994 "whether the fact that Gambotto has gone on appeal to
the High Court has any relevance to the plan to implement
the proposal by way
of special resolution at members' meetings and if so, what relevance";  and
<P>

(b)	as at May 1994, after the hearing of the appeal, "if there is anything you
wish to add to your opinion or if you wish to change
your opinion in any
way".
<P>

1200	In summary, in his evidence in chief Mr Bennett said that without perusal
of the transcripts of the application for special
leave to appeal or the
argument on appeal he would have said that the appeal to the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> was likely to fail;  with perusal of the transcript of
the application for special leave to appeal, he would have said that there
was
a possibility of the appeal being allowed, although a less than 50 per cent
prospect of success;  with perusal of the transcript
of the argument on the
appeal, he would have said that there was a reasonable prospect of the appeal
succeeding, "possibly slightly
in excess of 50 per cent";  and that in both
instances he would have said that the possible allowance of the appeal in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> would not affect the proposal.  
<P>

1201	Mr Bennett's reasons for this last view were that the proposal and the
expropriation in <i>Gambotto's case</i> were quite different;  first, in that
in the proposal all members were treated equally because all lost their
memberships and had
an entitlement to shares or cash;  secondly, in that the
members could continue to enjoy the same assets as shareholders;  and thirdly,
in that in <i>Gambotto's case</i> the interests and wishes of the majority
differed from those of the minority but under the proposal the interests of all
were identical.
 In his oral evidence he said that he thought that "the
parameters of Gambotto at the trial and in the Court of Appeal are sufficiently
narrow that it would be unlikely in the extreme that any decision by the High
Court, even one allowing the appeal, would be so wide
as to apply to this very
different sort of proposal".  He confirmed that he would have come to these
views having exercised reasonable
care. 
<P>

1202	For the present concentrating on Mr Bennett's evidence so far as it might
give content to the due care, skill and diligence
required of the defendants,
the cross-examination established that, in order to advise whether the appeal
in Gambotto's case was
likely to affect the proposal, he would have required to
see the transcripts, and that he would have foreseen a successful appeal
more
readily after the grant of special leave and would have expected the High Court
to decide the appeal by reference to principle
rather than on the particular
facts.  To this extent the NRMA's case was assisted, while remembering that the
course which Mr Bennett
would have taken and his expectation were not
necessarily the general or required course and expectation of a lawyer acting
with
due care and skill - for example, they may have exceeded what was involved
in the exercise of due care, skill and diligence.  With
a similar
qualification, in saying that, for the reasons outlined, he did not think that
the High Court was likely to express a principle
so wide as to affect the
proposal, Mr Bennett's evidence was adverse to the NRMA's case, but did not
directly address that case in
that it presupposed awareness of the possibility
that <i>Gambotto's case</i> might impact on the proposal.  Mr Bennett was asked
to advise on that possibility.  Even if Mr Bennett thought that <i>Gambotto's
case</i> would not impact on the proposal, should a lawyer in the position of
the defendants have adverted to the possibility?  
<P>

<b>(a)</b>  <b>Mr Heydon</b>
<P>

1203	I have found on the probabilities that Mr Morgan did refer to
<i>Gambotto's case</i> being on appeal at the conference on 14 December 1993,
and so that Mr Heydon was made aware of the appeal - even if only in a loose
sense which could have conveyed an application for special leave to appeal or
the grant of special leave to appeal - if he was not
otherwise aware.  
<P>

1204	In any event, I consider that Mr Heydon should have been aware of the
appeal, consistently with the exercise of due care, skill
and diligence.
<i>Gambotto's case</i> was a relevant case, at the least as a recent appellate
discussion of what could constitute oppression, and had been cited prominently
in the brief;  it was specifically referred to at the conference as the most
recent case in the area.  The report at hand disclosed
that an application for
special leave to appeal had been filed, and even if Mr Heydon thought that the
Court of Appeal was correct
in what it had said it was incumbent on him, in my
view, to take note that an application for special leave to appeal had been
filed
and follow it up to see whether special leave to appeal had been granted.
If a grant of special leave to appeal had been granted,
that would indicate
that members of the High Court considered that there was a point of principle
requiring clarification or correction,
and that there was at least a prospect
that the appeal would be allowed.  So the filing of the application for special
leave to appeal
could not be ignored.  
<P>

1205	In referring to at least a prospect of a successful appeal, I put aside
the evidence tendered by the NRMA by way of a statistical
analysis of
applications, grants, and appeals, since it did not allow for different kinds
of cases and to my mind would not be part
of the armoury of knowledge which a
barrister would bring to the practice of his profession.  But I accept that
from general knowledge
and experience a barrister would recognise, as did Mr
Bennett, that a grant of special leave to appeal warns of doubt about the
reasons
for the decision appealed against, and Mr Heydon's experience was that
about fifty per cent of appeals to the High Court succeeded
and that the
decisions were generally at the level of legal principle.  The percentages do
not much matter.  The prospect of reconsideration
at the level of legal
principle is what matters.
<P>

1206	Had he noted and followed up the application for special leave to appeal,
Mr Heydon would have found that special leave to
appeal had been granted on 10
December 1993.  Even if he did not then obtain the transcript of the
application for special leave
to appeal, he should have seen the prospect that
the appeal would be allowed to which I have referred (which not to say that the
appeal was more likely than not to succeed).  What did the exercise of due
care, skill and diligence, from someone expert in the
relevant field of law,
require?  
<P>

1207	I remind myself that hindsight must be avoided, and so that the upholding
of the appeal and the reasons given in the High Court
must not govern the
answer to that question.  The answer is to be found in an analysis of what
upholding the appeal could mean for
the proposal, viewed as at December 1993.
But it must not be forgotten that Mr Heydon was an expert in the relevant area
of the law,
and was briefed as such.  The exercise of reasonable care, skill
and diligence required appropriately thoughtful and informed analysis.
<P>

1208	I return to the earlier observations about <i>Gambotto's case</i>, up to
the decision of the Court of Appeal.  The effect of the decision of McLelland J
was that the fact of expropriation was enough
to constitute oppression.  The
effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal was that, if the expropriation
was fair, the fact of
expropriation would not make the exercise of the power to
change the articles invalid.  Both McLelland J and the Court of Appeal
found
unhelpful the test of constraint according to exercise of the power bona fide
for the benefit of the company as a whole, and
the High Court in earlier cases
had said much the same.  The outcome did not turn on oppression because of
unfairness, because the
acquisition of the shares was on fair terms.  So if the
appeal were upheld it was in prospect that it would be upheld pursuant to
a
principle fashioned by the High Court, other than a test of the exercise of the
power bona fide for the benefit of the company
as a whole, by which the fact of
expropriation, quite apart from fairness, constrained the exercise of the
power.  
<P>

1209	The principle could be as blunt as that upon which McLelland J had
apparently acted (and his Honour was a respected and experienced
judge in this
area), or could leave room for expropriation if a condition or conditions other
than fairness were met, but the prospect
was of constraint on the exercise of
the power to amend the articles greater than as held in the Court of Appeal.
At the heart of
any such constraint was likely to be (as in fact was evident in
the High Court's reasons, although for present purposes that must
be put aside)
that valuable proprietary rights were at stake, something foreshadowed in the
observation of Priestley JA in the Court
of Appeal that the divesting of
property from an owner without that owner's consent will often attract
community opinion that the
divestment was oppressive and/or unjust.  Whatever
was meant by expropriation, and notwithstanding points of distinction such as
those seen by Mr Bennett, if under the proposal members arguably lost valuable
proprietary rights, a successful appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> could mean
that the proposal could not be implemented by resolutions in general
meetings.
<P>

1210	In my opinion analysis of this kind should have led Mr Heydon to see in a
grant of special leave to appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> a risk in proceeding
by the resolutions in general meetings route.  Perusal of the transcript of the
special leave application, which
I think should have been done, would have
heightened concern about a risk, because the court did not call on the
applicant.  
<P>

1211	And, if the grant of special leave to appeal signalled the need to peruse
the transcript of the argument on appeal in due course,
such perusal would have
given further grounds for the analysis.  Mason CJ spoke of lack of power to
amend articles with the effect
of expropriating minority shareholders, not of
oppression.  So did Brennan J.  McHugh J spoke of prima facie oppression
to take someone's
shares away, and of infraction of proprietary rights, and
asked "Why should not a statutory power be read subject to the exception
if it
is not intended to take away such a fundamental right as your right to possess
their own share" (sic:  the transcript is corrupt,
but the meaning is clear).
Dawson J responded to the submission "One cannot say just because it is an
expropriation it is oppressive"
with a direct "Why not?".  Going back to
December 1993, these attitudes in the High Court could and should have been
foreseen by
a barrister professing the expertise of Mr Heydon.
<P>

1212	In my view, the risk of a decision on appeal adverse to an expropriation
of shares in the circumstances of <i>Gambotto's case</i> should have been seen.
The members of the NRMA had proprietary rights of at least some value, which Mr
Morgan himself had equated
with the proprietary rights of a shareholder in a
company limited by shares (see in particular his letter of 4 November 1993),
and
which Mr Heydon recognised (although perhaps describing them as weak
rights) in the conference on 29 April 1994 and his opinion of
14 June 1994.
There was a difference between the majority expropriating the shares of the
minority and a divesting of all memberships
in return for shares or cash, but
common to both was that proprietary rights were compulsorily taken away by
voting power in general
meeting.  A risk to compulsory divestment of membership
should also have been seen, depending on the principle fashioned by the High
Court and its basis, and the prospect to which I have referred included that
the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> would affect the implementation of the
proposal.  
<P>

1213	I do not overlook the evidence of Mr Bennett.  I am far from sure that, in
the circumstances in which it was given in chief
and by cross-examination, it
could properly be taken as evidence of what the exercise of due care, skill and
diligence required (more
precisely, did not require).  But, so far as the views
of individual lawyers upon the significance of the appeal in <i>Gambotto's
case</i> to the proposal may be taken into account as evidence of practice, it
is balanced, if not outweighed, by the attention given by CU,
ME and NS to the
appeal as something to be known about in order properly to advise the NRMA, and
by Professor Austin's express view,
prior to the decision of the High Court,
that a decision in favour of Mr Gambotto might present a problem because the
compulsory
extinguishment of membership might be necessarily oppressive.
Perhaps these firms and Professor Austin had the benefit of the transcript
of
the argument on appeal, but the attitudes earlier mentioned would not have been
unexpected if the process of analysis I have described
were undertaken.  
<P>

1214	That Mr Morgan saw the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> as something to be
watched in November 1994 could only tip the scales further.  The preponderance
of such "expert" evidence as there
was in what Mr Bennett, these firms, and
Professor Austin thought and did or would have done, in my opinion favours the
NRMA's case,
and is consistent with the view to which I would have come in the
absence of the assistance gained from that evidence.
<P>

1215	It was nonetheless submitted that, taking Mr Bennett's evidence as
evidence of what advice could have been given without carelessness
even though
others might have seen and advised of a risk (CU, ME, NS, and Professor
Austin), it would not have been negligent for
the defendants to conclude that
<i>Gambotto's case</i> would not affect the proposal and so not advise of risk
in proceeding by the resolutions in general meetings route.  I repeat my
doubt
about this use of Mr Bennett's evidence, and in any event do not accept the
submission.  
<P>

1216	Although concluding that it was "unlikely in the extreme" that a decision
upholding the appeal would be "so wide as to apply
to this very different sort
of proposal", Mr Bennett explained his reasons.  The reasons were open to
debate, and a different opinion
was at the least reasonably open.  As I have
explained Mr Bennett was asked to advise of the relevance to the implementation
of the
proposal of the appeal to the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and
his evidence presupposed awareness of the possibility that <i>Gambotto's
case</i> might impact on the proposal.  Mr Heydon did not recognise or give
thought to the possibility.  In my opinion the issue posed was
such that,
notwithstanding that Mr Bennett saw a reasonably clear answer, there was still
a risk which should have  been recognised
in advice to the NRMA.
<P>

1217	Perhaps curiously, in order to repel a causation argument in connection
with free shares/disadvantages negligence to which
I will come, the NRMA itself
submitted that <i>Gambotto's case</i> as decided by the High Court would not
have prevented the demutualisation from proceeding.  It said that there were
two "simple and
obvious" features taking the proposal out of the reach of
<i>Gambotto's case</i>.  One was that there was no expropriation by a majority
because the majority was not expropriating anything.  The other was that
everyone was treated equally, and all were given the same option.  These
features have some similarity to those underlying Mr Bennett's
reasons for
advising that <i>Gambotto's case</i> would not affect the proposal.  They are,
however, a product of knowledge after the event, and I am not moved by the
NRMA's present
stance in this respect to depart from what I have said in the
preceding paragraphs.
<P>

1218	In my opinion, therefore, in responding to the revised brief delivered on
15 or 16 December 1993 Mr Heydon should have adverted
to the grant of special
leave to appeal to the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and should have
warned that if the appeal were upheld it might be upheld on grounds inimical to
the validity of resolutions in general
meetings having the effect that members
of the NRMA were deprived of their memberships.  Mr Heydon may have thought,
and said, the
appeal would not succeed, or that if it succeeded it would not
succeed on grounds relevant to the proposal, but he did not advert
to
<i>Gambotto's case</i> in this respect, to an appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>,
or to risk.  At the least, a warning whereby further consideration should be
given to the risk when the appeal had been heard, with
the benefit of the
transcript of the argument, should have been given.,  If that had been done, as
earlier explained the transcript
of the argument would have given further
grounds for the analysis I have described.  
<P>

1219	I do not think that, as faintly suggested in the conduct of Mr Heydon's
case, failure to advert to the risk can adequately
be explained by the
reservation for a later occasion of advice on the other issues in the brief, or
by the course taken at the conference
on 2 February 1994 when those other
issues had been raised in the brief of 25 January 1994 and the letter of 31
January 1994.  Certainly
the other issues and parts of the later brief and
letter were to do with oppression, but oppression because of unfairness.  The
potential
in the appeal to the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i> was in a
sense to do with oppression, but not oppression because of unfairness;  rather,
oppression because of the expropriatory
nature of the proposal.  For reasons I
have explained, oppression of that kind fell within the advice required of Mr
Heydon in December
1993, but if it was not then the subject of advice there
were occasions in February and March 1994 when, with appreciation that the
issue was not oppression because of unfairness but oppression because of the
expropriatory nature of the process, Mr Heydon should
have returned to it.  
<P>

1220	It is, I think, appropriate to test what I have said against evidence of
Mr Heydon.  Without setting out the passages, there
can be found in his
evidence acceptance that -
<P>

(a)	if he had been aware of the appeal, he would not have expected the High
Court to have decided <i>Gambotto's case</i> on the facts, but would have
expected that "either some renewal of existing principle or some change to it
was likely to occur";
 
<P>

(b)	when he first read <i>Gambotto's case</i> (in context, before the decision
of the High Court) he recognised it as a case dealing with the elimination or
extinguishment of
the rights of shareholders;
<P>

(c)	it was a case about whether expropriation of shareholders, even for an
adequate value, was "as it were per se unlawful";
<P>

(d)	if one knew only that there was an appeal to the High Court "it would be
difficult to think of any other significant issue in
that appeal except a
resolution of the difference between the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal";
<P>

(e)	the decision of the Court of Appeal "sanctioned the use of the resolution
path as a means of expropriating minority interests";
<P>

(f)	the appeal to the High Court was appropriately described as an examination
of the legitimacy of one of the methods of acquiring
minority held shares;
namely, the method of alteration of the articles of association;  
<P>

(g)	he recognised when he read and heard the explanation of the proposal that
it involved the extinguishment or termination of membership
of Association and
Insurance;  
<P>

(h)	he had no recollection one way or the other of recognising that to that
extent <i>Gambotto's case</i> "bore upon the questions at issue" (but he did
not agree that in retrospect it would be "hard to have missed the point");
<P>

(i)	the question "Why can't he say I just want to stay a member of Association
and Insurance" (see Mr Heydon's note for the conference
of 7 March 1994) was
"the very case Mr Gambotto was making";  that issue was "a Gambotto style
issue".
<P>

1221	Mr Heydon gave his evidence carefully and with candour, and in these
respects it seems to me to support the position that,
had he given attention to
the appeal, he would have seen that the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> might
be upheld on grounds inimical to the validity of resolutions in general
meetings having the effect that members of the NRMA
were deprived of their
memberships.  That position is supported, in my view, even when Mr Heydon said
that it was his view in 1993-94
that it was not necessary for a company wishing
to proceed by way of members' resolution in a proposal such as the NRMA's
proposal
to establish that its purpose was to secure itself from significant
detriment or harm (that being a necessary purpose stated in the
decision of the
High Court).  He did not give attention to the appeal.  
<P>

1222	Mr Heydon said in his evidence that he had not "put myself in my chair in
1994 to see looking forward what the outcome might
be" if advising on the
likely result of the appeal or the effect of a successful appeal on the
proposal, and that he could not do
that in a reliable way in the witness box
because it would be necessary to engage in quite an extensive inquiry into the
cases and
texts.  He said that "what the High Court did was, as it were, survey
the earlier authorities and propound a view different from
the Court of Appeal.
A similar sort of process of analysis would have to be undertaken if one was to
try and predict what would happen
to the Court of Appeal's judgment once the
High Court had decided the case".  On one view, there was in this a degree of
acceptance
that there was occasion for such an inquiry.  
<P>

<b>(b)  AAH and AT</b>
<P>

1223	The reasoning I have outlined in relation to Mr Heydon applies in
principle to AAH and AT.  I do not accept their submission
to the effect that
it was not a breach of the duty of care to fail to be aware of the application
for special leave to appeal, or
of the appeal, or to fail to perceive that
<i>Gambotto's case</i> might present a risk to the proposal.  
<P>

1224	Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman professed and had expertise in corporations law.
They could and should have followed up the application
for special leave to
appeal, and undertaken the analysis I have described - they were not tyros in
the field, or general practitioners
entitled to rely on others with greater
expertise.  What I have said in relation to Mr Heydon applies to them also.
But there was
more.
<P>

1225	Mr Bateman had questioned whether a minority of members could deprive the
majority of membership, and <i>Gambotto's case</i> had been specifically raised
by Mr Morgan as the answer to his concern.  Mr Bateman's answer was that
<i>Gambotto's case</i> as decided in the Court of Appeal may not provide a
sound basis for proceeding by the resolutions in general meetings route, for
reasons only partially involving necessarily oppressive expropriation, but one
would have expected Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman to ensure
that the application for
special leave to appeal was followed up and that regard was had to the pending
appeal in the advice which
would direct the important choice between scheme or
meeting.  
<P>

1226	Strangely, the grounds for Mr Bateman's concern were not translated into
the brief to Mr Heydon, and while <i>Gambotto's case</i> in the Court of Appeal
was prominent in the observations in the brief it was not put forward as
relevant to the essential disagreement
between Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman,
whether the fact of something like expropriation would make the exercise of the
power to amend
the articles invalid.  
<P>

1227	Concentration on <i>Gambotto's case</i> as relevant only to oppression in
the sense of unfairness, by reason of the basis of entitlement, seems to have
sent the advice on
scheme or meeting down a narrower path than was warranted,
and the solicitors did not adequately address  either the grounds for
Mr
Bateman's concern or, following through Mr Morgan's view that <i>Gambotto's
case</i> in the Court of Appeal did provide a sound basis for proceeding by the
resolutions in general meetings route, whether the pending
appeal might affect
that basis.  They did not give thought to an analysis of the kind I have
described when dealing with Mr Heydon's
position, but their positions and
expertise were such that they should have.  
<P>

1228	Had they done so, it would have been obvious to them that Mr Heydon had
not given due attention to the risk from the appeal
to the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> to implementation of the proposal by resolutions in
general meetings.  The opinion of 20 December 1993 did not refer to
<i>Gambotto's case</i> at all.  It was primarily concerned with the source of
power in s 167 of the Law and the memoranda and articles of Association and
Insurance, and did not consider possible constraint on the exercise of the
power because of something like expropriation.  For reasons
I have given,
reservation of oppression for a later opinion should not have been seen as the
explanation for the deficiency, but
in any event neither AAH nor AT took steps
to ensure that, when oppression was dealt with (to the extent to which it was),
the present
relevance of<i> Gambotto's case</i>, and the possible significance
of the appeal to the High Court, were addressed and the subject of advice.  So
AAH and AT left the
NRMA without that advice, and because they did not
themselves address risk to the proposal from the appeal to the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, or ensure that Mr Heydon addressed it, they also did
not exercise due care, skill and diligence.  
<P>

1229	In what I have said I have put AAH and AT together.  It was submitted by
AT that its position was different from that of AAH.
 It was said that Mr
Bateman had expressed reservations at the meetings of 3 and 6 December 1993 on
the question of scheme or meeting,
saying he thought a scheme of arrangement
was necessary;  that Ms Conway and Mr Rees at the meeting of 6 December 1993
had firmly
said that Mr Morgan would deal with the matter;  that Mr Bateman
maintained his reservations, and brought them to the meetings of
the due
diligence committee on 30 March 1994 and 1 July 1994;  that Mr Morgan had been
left to obtain a final opinion from Mr Heydon;
 and that the opinion (Mr
Heydon's opinion of 28 July 1994, which Mr Bateman did not see until mid-August
1994) was plain.  According
to the submission, Mr Bateman had "legitimately
deferred to and relied on the opinions of those retained and briefed on the
matter
when his view had been specifically not preferred by the client".  It
was not for him to speak out any more than he had done, and
his sign-off letter
was accordingly and appropriately qualified in para 5.2 to exclude an opinion
concerning "whether the resolution
of members will bind all members".  
<P>

1230	I do not think this answers the basis for my conclusion that AT, in common
with AAH, did not exercise due care, skill and diligence.
 
<P>

1231	Having expressed his reservations, which he attributed to a feeling that
the resolutions in general meeting route was not right
rather than to risk from
<i>Gambotto's case</i> or any other reasoned regard to statute or general law,
Mr Bateman's obligation was to see that the NRMA received proper advice.
 His
reservations had been answered by reference to <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and when
<i>Gambotto's case</i> was on appeal it followed that the answer might shortly
lose its basis.  For that reason alone, one would have expected Mr Bateman
to
speak out more than he had done, but as well the reasons I have given meant
that the proper advice included regard to the appeal
in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.

<P>

1232	As I have said, it would have been obvious to Mr Bateman that Mr Heydon
had not given due attention to the risk from the appeal
to implementation of
the proposal by resolutions in general meeting.  His own continued reservations
raised on 30 March 1994 and
11 July 1994 show that he did not think the NRMA
had been properly advised.  He did not himself give attention to the risk, or
pursue
attention to it by Mr Heydon or Mr Morgan, and the opinion of 28 July
1994 was as silent as the opinion of 20 December 1993 on the
matters which had
excited Mr Bateman's reservations and on <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  Mr Bateman
could not adopt a passive role, and in doing so, and failing himself to have
regard to the pending appeal in the choice
between scheme and meeting, he did
not discharge his duty of care.
<P>

1233	Mr Bateman referred to and relied on what was said to be an analogous
situation in <i>Unioil International Pty Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu</i>
(Ipp J  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2017%20WAR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 17 WAR 98</a>, only reported in part;  FC, 30 September 1998,
unreported).  I do not think that case assists AT's submission.  The plaintiffs
made
a disastrous investment in a corporate group.  Accountants and solicitors
were engaged to undertake a due diligence investigation
of the group.  Ipp J
considered and made findings on the demarcation of the work to be done between
the accountants and the solicitors,
and said that the ambit of the solicitors'
duty depended on what they were to do.  He accepted that if in the course of
their work
the solicitors came into possession of information which was not
confidential and was clearly of potential significance to the client,
the
solicitors should advise the client of it, and that both professionals should
advise of any "deal breakers".  In the present
case, as I have said, the
retainer of AT extended to advice upon whether the proposal could and should be
implemented by scheme or
meeting, which included regard to and advice on risk
in the resolutions in general meetings route.  Mr Bateman was not absolved from
attention to that matter when he knew or should have known that it had not
properly been addressed.
<P>

1234	AAH submitted that it was entitled to rely on Mr Heydon's advice in
discharging any duty of care concerning <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  The detail in
support of the submission seemed to go beyond it, and in large part to be
unrelated to it, but included that AAH
acted reasonably in obtaining Mr
Heydon's advice and, in doing so, referring him to <i>Gambotto's case</i> in
the context of the validity of proceeding by members' resolutions.  The detail
going beyond the submission seemed to contend that
there was no breach of the
duty of care owed by AAH because any risk posed by the appeal in <i>Gambotto's
case</i> was "outside what a competent practitioner at the time would regard as
being within the traditional issues associated with oppression".
 
<P>

1235	The submission so far as it concerned reliance on Mr Heydon's advice is
answered by what I have already said.  The retainer
of AAH required that it
exercise due care, skill and diligence in acting for the NRMA, and it did not
cease to have that obligation
because it briefed Mr Heydon.  Particularly where
Mr Morgan professed and had expertise in corporations law, the NRMA was
entitled
to the benefit of his expertise, including participation with Mr
Heydon in ensuring that a relevant matter was addressed by him:
 cf <i>Yates
Property Corporation (in Liquidation) v Boland </i>at 48-9.  The submission so
far as it concerned traditional issues associated with oppression is also
answered by what I have said.
 On an analysis of the kind I have described, the
traditional issues associated with oppression were under challenge, and the
competent
practitioner should have so recognised (as a number of practitioners
did).
<P>

1236	AT put a slightly different submission.  It said that it was reasonable
for Mr Bateman to act on the law declared in a unanimous
decision of the Court
of Appeal until it was overturned, particularly when eminent senior counsel
experienced in the field had expressed
his agreement with the decision and had
not thereafter withdrawn or qualified his agreement.  In the circumstances I
have outlined
I do not agree that it was reasonable;  in brief, the submission
ignored the significance of a grant of leave to appeal and the inattention
to
it by the senior counsel to which I have referred.
<P>

<b>Causation</b>
<P>

1237	The advice about scheme or meeting was obtained while management was
developing the proposal for presentation to the boards.
 As earlier recorded,
in relation to causation the NRMA's case was that if the Gambotto advice had
been given the boards would have
voted to stop or slow down the proposal and,
if not all, of the expenditure after 17 March 1994 or 28 April 1994 would have
been
avoided.  
<P>

1238	Implicitly, it was accepted by the NRMA that warning of risk to
implementation of the proposal by the resolutions in general
meetings route
would not have caused management to abort the proposal, and that management
would still have presented the proposal
to the boards on (as it happened) 17
March 1994, but with deferral of the proposal until after the decision of the
High Court was
known as one course open to the boards.  A decision to proceed
by way of scheme of arrangement was not put forward as an alternative
course,
either in the NRMA's evidence or in submissions - indeed, in submissions the
NRMA said that it was not part of its case that
there should have been advice
that the risk posed by <i>Gambotto's case</i> might be avoided by taking the
scheme of arrangement route.
<P>

1239	There is some artificiality in this.  Had there been given in December
1993 the Gambotto advice which the NRMA said should
have been given, management
may well have directed the development of the proposal along the scheme of
arrangement route.  The two
alternatives were squarely posed at the beginning
of December 1993, and were recorded for decision by or on 4 January 1994.
While
there was a preference for the resolutions in general meetings route,
because it was perceived that there would be a lesser platform
for opponents to
the proposal, management could have decided that it was better to suffer the
enhanced platform rather than present
the opponents with a <i>Gambotto's
case</i> argument.  If management did not so decide, and presented the proposal
to the boards accordingly, the boards may have considered
that the scheme of
arrangement route was preferable to delaying the proposal for an unknown period
pending the decision of the High
Court, with the possibility that the decision
dictated the scheme of arrangement route in any event.  
<P>

1240	But the NRMA did not seek to improve its recovery by a case for
abandonment of the proposal by management (or the boards) prior
to 17 March
1994.  Nor, with the exception of questions to Dr Werner asking if he would
have "favoured a scheme of arrangement" if
told that "the object could be
achieved with legal certainty", did the defendants in the course of the
evidence seek to meet the
case as presented by the NRMA by cross-examination of
the NRMA's witnesses to suggest that the NRMA would have continued with the
proposal but by the scheme of arrangement route.  Relevantly, the issue between
the parties was whether or not, if the Gambotto advice
had been given, the NRMA
would have put the proposal on hold and so avoided wasted expenditure.
<P>

1241	A submission particularly made by Mr Heydon was that, assuming Mr Heydon
had given the Gambotto advice which the NRMA said
should have been given, it
was likely that it would not have been communicated to the NRMA, and even more
likely that within the
NRMA it would not have been communicated to the boards.
I do not accept the submission.
<P>

1242	For the first limb of the submission it was said that Mr Heydon's advice
would have gone to Mr Morgan and/or Mr Bateman, and
that it was likely that
they would not have passed it on.  It was likely that they would not have
passed it on, it was said, because
with the knowledge they in fact had they did
not tell anyone at the NRMA about <i>Gambotto's case</i> being on appeal and
its possible relevance to the implementation of the proposal.  
<P>

1243	Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman failed so to advise the NRMA, but not because
they considered the matter unworthy of communication
to the NRMA.  Rather, they
failed because they did not see the risk and consequent relevance.  The
reasoning in this limb of the
submission is astray.  Its hypothesis was not put
to Mr Morgan or Mr Bateman, and in my opinion it is all but unthinkable that,
if
Mr Heydon had warned of a risk to proceeding by the resolutions in general
meetings route, the solicitors would not have passed on
what he said to the
NRMA.  The question of scheme or meeting was an important question, alive at
the time, and known to management.
 I do not accept this limb of the
submission.
<P>

1244	For the second limb of the submission it was said that the communication
would have been to Ms Godwin or Ms Conway, that it
would have been "filtered"
or "interpreted" at management level, and that the boards would have received
no more than a fairly generalised
summary of what management had done in the
development of the proposal.  Many references were given to the directors'
faith in and
reliance on management, including in receiving only the
end-product of management's consideration of a number of matters, and it
was
said that what would have happened was demonstrated by the retention of Mr
Heydon's opinions of 2 and 3 August 1994 at management
level and (in another
use of the evidence on the matter) by the failure to provide to the boards the
opinions of Mr Jackson of 19
October 1994 and Mr Heydon of 20 October 1994.
That the boards were not told in early 1994 of the CU, ME and NS concerns in
early
1995 about the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> was said to support that
management would not have passed on the Gambotto advice.  Further, it was said,
the NRMA had not led evidence
from Mr Rees or Ms Conway, or called Mr Willing
to give evidence, that Gambotto advice would have been passed on to the boards,
so
a conclusion favourable to the NRMA should not be inferred (<i>Commercial
Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd</i> (1991) 22 NSWLR 289
at 418-9;  <i>Huntsman Chemical Company Australia Ltd v International Pools
Australia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 242</a> at 263-9) and a conclusion to the
contrary could more comfortably be reached (<i>Jones v Dunkel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101
CLR 298).</a>
<P>

1245	Given the importance of the question of scheme or meeting, both as to the
fundamental procedure for a demutualisation and as
material to the voicing of
and grounds for opposition to the proposal, I consider it very likely, at the
least, that management would
have reported to the boards on the two possible
routes and, amongst other things, the risk the subject of the Gambotto advice.
Assurance
about the chosen route was seen as important for the due diligence
committee, and rightly so;  I do not think management would have
left the
boards unaware of the risk.  I so conclude despite what was put about inferring
and comfort in conclusions, and am not swayed
from my conclusion by the other
matters to which I have referred.  It was thought that the free shares problem
identified by Mr Heydon
had been adequately dealt with, but in any event a
number of directors were made aware of it, and the circumstances of
non-disclosure
of the opinions in October 1994 and of the attention to
<i>Gambotto's case</i> in early 1995 were very different from those at the time
of the question of scheme or meeting in early 1994.  I do not accept this
limb
of the submission either.
<P>

1246	I have already set out the Gambotto advice as defined in the points of
claim, and noted that it was rather different from the
Gambotto advice taken up
in the NRMA's evidence.  Rather different again was the Gambotto advice as
summarised in the NRMA's submissions,
to repeat, advice that <i>Gambotto's
case</i> was on appeal to the High Court and, after 10 December 1993, that the
appeal had reasonable prospects of success and there was a
real risk that the
High Court's decision might adversely impact upon the proposal.  
<P>

1247	This was certainly a summary, because the case that the boards would have
voted to stop or slow down the proposal, put through
the evidence of a number
of the NRMA directors at the time called by the NRMA, took up a common form,
lengthy, assumed advice set
out in their witness statements - 
<P>

"I have been asked to assume that at or prior to the meetings of 17 March 1994
referred to above that either the First Defendants
(`AAH'), the Second
Defendants (`AT') or both of them had advised me that -
<P>

(a)	there existed a real risk that the Project as then envisaged and formulated
could be rendered unlawful by an adverse decision
of the High Court of
Australia in an appeal in the case of <i>Gambotto v WCP Limited</i> (`the
Gambotto case');
<P>

(b)	Mr Gambotto's claim was heard at first instance by Justice McClelland [sic]
in the Equity Division, Supreme Court of New South
Wales.  He found in favour
of Mr Gambotto on 29 June 1992.  WPC appealed to the New South Wales Court of
Appeal and the appeal was
heard on 4 March 1993.  The Court of Appeal gave
judgment (3-0) on 7 May 1993 allowing the appeal.  Before Justice McClelland
[sic]
and in the Court of Appeal Mr Gambotto was represented by Solicitors and
Counsel;
<P>

(c)	Mr Gambotto sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia
and that application was heard on 10 December 1993.
 Mr Gambotto appeared for
himself.  Mr Gambotto was successful and special leave was granted;
<P>

(d)	special leave was not granted as of right.  The High Court has a discretion
as to whether to grant special leave.  In exercising
that discretion, the Court
has regard to the public importance of any question of law and the need to
resolve judicial differences
of opinion concerning the state of the law.  In
addition, the Court shall consider whether the administration of justice,
either
generally or in the particular case, requires an application for special
leave to be granted.  The High Court grants special leave
sparingly.  The case
concerned needs to involve some point of general interest and generally, there
needs to be substantial doubt
as to the correctness of the decision being
appealed;
<P>

(e)	Mr Gambotto's appeal to the High Court was listed for hearing by the High
Court on 21 April 1994;
<P>

(f)	once the decision to proceed with the investigation of the Project was made
significant expenditure would be incurred to take
the Project up to the
approval stage.  This expenditure would amount to several million dollars;
<P>

(g)	there existed a real risk that the expenditure on the investigation of the
Project could be wasted by the decision of the High
Court in the Gambotto
case."
<P>

1248	This hypothetical advice founded evidence of the directors' voting at the
meetings on 17 March 1994.  For the meetings on 28
April 1994 the hypothetical
advice repeated paras (a) to (d) and paras (f) and (g), and added that the
appeal had been heard by the
High Court on 21 April 1994, that Mr Gambotto had
appeared for himself, that the High Court had reserved judgment, that the
issues
raised in the case were "alive" to a sufficient degree that the High
Court had reserved its decision, and that the High Court could
take up to a
year to deliver judgment but it could also be given within a few months.
<P>

1249	Of the sixteen directors of Association, twelve gave evidence of what
their reaction to the Gambotto advice would have been.
 Miss Fraser, Ms
Singleton, and Mr Talbot did not, but since they were opposed to the proposal
it may be accepted that they would
not have voted to continue with it despite
the Gambotto advice.  Dr Vanderfield did not, and there was evidence to the
effect that
he was unwilling to give evidence for fear that the stress of doing
so might exacerbate a heart condition.  
<P>

1250	Of the eleven directors of Insurance (overlapping with the directors of
Association), nine gave evidence of what their reaction
to the Gambotto advice
would have been.  Ms Singleton did not, but again she would not have voted in
favour of continuing with the
proposal.  Mr Willing did not, and the evidence
explaining his absence (he was available) was unsatisfactory:  in his case, but
not
that of Dr Vanderfield, I consider that I can proceed on the basis that his
evidence would not have assisted the NRMA. 
<P>

1251	I do not think the absence of Dr Vanderfield and Mr Willing matters,
however, because whether the boards would have voted to
stop or slow down the
proposal can be decided on the evidence of the other directors and with
acceptance that the directors opposed
to the proposal would have voted against
it.  My decision would not be altered by any inference available from their
absence.
<P>

1252	Taking only the witness statements through which they gave their evidence
in chief, the reactions of the directors to the Gambotto
advice may be
summarised as follows.

<P>

1253	Taking this material at face value, reactions to the Gambotto advice would
have been varied.  Five of the directors would have
considered alternative
courses rather than deferral of the proposal, and while the preponderant
reaction was one of deferral a number
of the directors would have permitted
limited expenditure.  
<P>

1254	It was, of course, not easy for the directors to put themselves in the
position of receipt of the hypothetical Gambotto advice
and come to views upon
what they would have done, particularly when the wider hypothesis did not spell
out any other matters which
would have influenced their conduct at the time and
when the failure of the proposal and the bringing of these proceedings could
affect the reconstruction by the most honest director of what he or she would
have done.  Further, in reality there probably would
have been discussion at
the board meetings and the modification of views towards a consensus, and a
tabulation of individual reconstructions
does not allow for the dynamics of the
meetings.  
<P>

1255	Particular aspects of the directors' difficulties were brought out in
cross-examination.  Some agreed that they would have
wanted to know more, or
would have wanted further advice.  Some expressed their understanding of the
"real risk" in the hypothetical
Gambotto advice as something more likely than
not to happen (one put it as something over 70 per cent), but most resisted a
percentage
assessment and, in varying ways, accepted that the risk would have
been evaluated and, depending on its extent, they would have voted
for or
against deferring the proposal.  Some would have proceeded if the risk was very
low or low, or if there was a high degree
of certainty of a favourable outcome.
One would not have gone ahead under any circumstances, although that present
view in my opinion
was strongly influenced by none too rational hindsight.
Some really reached the position in which they could only say that they would
have evaluated the risk in conjunction with their fellow directors and made an
appropriate decision.  
<P>

1256	This does not separately summarise the cross-examinations, which produced
a degree of confusion (in both questioning and answering)
and a spectrum of
views.  But it is sufficient for present purposes:  I do not think the basic
caution of the directors was materially
altered.  The cross-examination also
put to a number of the directors the alternative hypothesis of a second opinion
additional to
the Gambotto advice propounded by the NRMA, in which senior
counsel said that a successful appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> was unlikely to
affect the proposal - this was intended to found reliance on the evidence of Mr
Bennett to which I have already referred.
<P>

1257	In a number of cases it has been recognised that the evidence of a witness
as to what he would have done in hypothetical circumstances,
while admissible,
may be of little weight because given with hindsight and possibly self-serving
(see for example <i>Dominelli Ford Hurstville Pty Ltd v Karmot Auto Spares Pty
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/550.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 550</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2038%20FCR%20471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 38 FCR 471</a> at 483;  <i>Hosmer Holdings Pty Ltd v CAJ Investments

AG</i> (Hodgson J, 5 September 1996, unreported);  <i>Allstate Life Insurance
Co v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1996%29%2064%20FCR%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1996) 64 FCR 73</a> at

significantly to discount the evidence of the directors in the present case.  I
am satisfied
that most of them were endeavouring fairly to place themselves in
the position in March or April 1994 required by the hypotheses
put to them, and
I consider that, despite reservations about the evidence of one or two of the
directors, their evidence may be accepted
as establishing that the collegiate
reactions of the boards would have been of caution, of unwillingness to proceed
with the proposal
beyond further internal development unless firmly advised
that the resolutions in general meetings route was not attended by risk
of
invalidity flowing from the decision of the High Court in <i>Gambotto's
case</i>.  
<P>

1258	It is necessary, of course, to go beyond the evidence of the directors in
order to determine what would have happened if the
Gambotto advice had been
given, and the defendants submitted that if that were done it had clearly not
been established that the
NRMA would have acted differently if the Gambotto
advice had been given.  
<P>

1259	It was submitted that if the Gambotto advice had been given it would not
have reached the boards, or at least not in a form
which would have caused the
boards to stop or slow down the proposal:  I have already dealt with this.  
<P>

1260	It was submitted that the boards were given little information about the
proposal, in Mr Rees' report of 8 March 1994 or at
all, and in particular
little information about risks attendant upon it;  that the boards resolved to
proceed with the proposal on
17 March 1994 in concrete terms, evidencing a
commitment to demutualisation rather than inclination subject to assessment of
risks;
 that the boards continued with the proposal notwithstanding the risks
to its success in obtaining taxation relief (the Treasurer's
final agreement on
taxation relief was not obtained until 15 August 1994), Stock Exchange approval
to a shareholding limitation (the
approval was not formally obtained until
early August 1994), and ultimately a favourable vote at the general meetings;
and that management
and an inner group of directors really controlled the
process and were so intent on having the proposal proceed that Gambotto advice,
if given, would not have been heeded.  
<P>

1261	This tended to merge with the submission that the majority of the
directors were so determined that the proposal should proceed,
and should
proceed prior to the next annual general meeting amongst other reasons in order
to increase the prospects of displacing
the MAG directors, that they would have
run even a substantial risk in order to have the proposal before the members of
the NRMA
in October 1994.  
<P>

1262	So, it was said, the proposal was kept secret in July 1993 (I have already
dealt with that);  only the BT preferred option
went to the boards in March
1994, not the other options;  before the meetings of 17 March 1994 a time-table
was in place for implementation
of the proposal, external advisers had been
retained, and even the information hotline had been established;  opposition
from Mr
Talbot was sought to be nullified by the late briefing session and the
order and timing of meetings on 17 March 1994 (I have also
referred to this);
in other ways appearing from the recital of facts in these reasons, for example
as to Mr Lawson's motion of 30
June 1994, opposition to the proposal or even
full exploration of its disadvantages was discouraged;  and the boards adopted
and
continued with the proposal notwithstanding other risks to its success
already mentioned, that is, risks of obtaining taxation relief,
Stock Exchange
approval to a shareholding limitation, and ultimately a favourable vote at the
general meetings.  The events in October
1994 were invoked as showing a resolve
by the majority of the boards, or their key members, to press on with the
proposal by appealing
to the Full Court of the Federal Court without disclosure
of the adverse opinions of Mr Jackson and Mr Heydon.  
<P>

1263	There was much more to this effect in the cases of the defendants, and a
great deal of their attention in cross-examination
was directed to it.  I have
used general descriptions, without seeking to be exhaustive but intending to
refer to the recounting
of the history of the proposal earlier in these
reasons, and to other like matters in the detailed written submissions of the
defendants.
 
<P>

1264	I do not find the defendants' case in these respects at all persuasive.  I
see no reason why management should not have presented
the boards with the
proposal as it had been developed, and am quite satisfied that a risk of the
nature of the "real risk" in the
Gambotto advice was of such significance that
it would have been included in what was put before the boards (if management
had not
itself decided to take the scheme of arrangement route - see above).
There is nothing in the defendants' reliance upon such matters
as the retention
of external advisers and establishment of the hotline - it is not to be
expected that the boards would have approved
proceeding with the proposal
unless the preparation for proceeding had been made, including how to deal with
the inevitable inquiries.
 Despite all that the defendants sought to bring out
and put in submissions, I do not think that the favourable view of
demutualisation
held by the majority of the boards, for whatever reasons, would
have caused them to disregard the Gambotto advice, if given, or to
proceed with
the proposal in the face of advice that there was a risk that the decision of
the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i> might adversely impact upon it.
<P>

1265	There is no doubt that many members of the boards, and some members of
senior management, found Mr Talbot difficult, and considered
that he and to
some extent the other MAG directors did not discharge their offices as
directors in the best interests of the NRMA.
 Some of the directors saw the
possible demise of MAG an additional benefit in demutualisation, because for
the benefit of the NRMA.
 But I do not accept that such antipathy as there was
directed or influenced the directors, still less senior management, to stances
or actions inimical to the interests of the NRMA, or that the directors would
have been moved to proceed with the proposal in the
face of the Gambotto advice
when they would not otherwise have so acted.  A "real risk" as hypothesised in
the Gambotto advice propounded
by the NRMA was different from the so-called
risks of obtaining tax relief, a shareholding limitation, and ultimately
favourable
votes at the general meetings.  These last-mentioned matters were
seen as or were essential to the demutualisation, and had to be
achieved;  if
they were achieved, the demutualisation would proceed and succeed, and they
were not risks to the proposal but necessary
steps to its completion.  The
"real risk" in the Gambotto advice was a risk to the proposal, and could bring
the demutualisation
undone. 
<P>

1266	To the contrary of the defendants' submissions, it seems to me that the
probabilities strongly favour finding the cautious
collegiate view of the
boards to which I earlier referred.  
<P>

1267	The Gambotto advice propounded by the NRMA included "real risk" that the
proposal could be rendered unlawful by an adverse
decision of the High Court in
the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and that the expenditure on the
investigation of the proposal could be wasted.  It is probable, and to some
extent this was brought
out in cross-examination, that the directors would have
asked or been told why, and they would have been told something to the effect
that there was a risk that the decision of the High Court would mean that the
resolutions passed at the general meetings would be
held to be invalid because
necessarily oppressive.  What they would have been told in amplification of the
hypothetical Gambotto
advice would in my view be unlikely to have overcome
their caution, particularly if there were explained to them the analysis I have
earlier made.  
<P>

1268	Even if a senior counsel - Mr Heydon or someone else - had said that he
did not think that the appeal would succeed, or that
if it succeeded it would
not succeed on grounds relevant to the proposal, I doubt that the opinion could
or would have been given
in terms reducing whatever the directors might have
thought was meant by a real risk to something which they could ignore or to a
risk they could run.  Opposition to demutualisation was expected, as evidenced
by the war gaming session and Ms Conway's request
for advice to Mr Bateman.
The expected opposition included through legal proceedings alleging oppression:
I have referred to much
from which this was plain in going through the facts.
It is all but inconceivable that the directors would not have been acutely
conscious that, if the decision of the High Court so allowed, Mr Talbot would
assert invalidity of the resolutions and that the demutualisation
was
ineffective.  It is all but inconceivable that the directors would have exposed
themselves to that situation on such a fundamental
matter in the implementation
of the proposal - they would lose credibility and the support of the NRMA
members if it were shown that,
notwithstanding advice that the resolutions
might be held to be invalid, they nonetheless took the resolutions in general
meetings
route.  
<P>

1269	The interests of the NRMA, and self interest of the directors favouring
demutualisation and (if you will) opposed to MAG, together
dictated the prudent
course of awaiting the decision of the High Court unless there was firm advice
that the resolutions in general
meetings route was not attended by invalidity.
Those wishing to see the MAG representation lessened might have preferred to
achieve
demutualisation promptly, and for practical reasons it was desirable
that the momentum of the Legal Status Project be maintained,
but I do not think
that those or any other considerations would have outweighed the reasons in
favour of deferring the proposal until
the decision of the High Court was
known.  On the probabilities, in my opinion, the NRMA would have put the
proposal on hold.
<P>

1270	What then of the reliance on the evidence of Mr Bennett?  Let it be
assumed that, as a number of the directors said, further
advice of senior
counsel would have been requested.  If the senior counsel had been Mr Bennett,
he would have advised that the possible
allowance of the appeal in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> would not affect the proposal.  
<P>

1271	I doubt whether, in the assessment of the risk which would then have
fallen to the boards, it would have been seen as sufficiently
small that the
proposals should proceed.  I do not suggest that the boards would timidly have
deferred demutualisation in the face
of the slightest risk, but there would
then have been divergent opinions, and it is probable that the boards would
have explored
why one of the opinions saw a risk (if they had not already done
so):  for example, Mr Easson was clearly of a questioning mind and
would have
wanted to explore the opinions, and others (Mr Burrows, Mr Corrigan, Mr Kirby)
would probably have done the same.  There
would have been explanation.  On the
reasoning which I outlined when dealing with negligence, the boards may well
have concluded
that, despite Mr Bennett's opinion, there was a risk of
sufficient magnitude to warrant deferral of the proposal.  
<P>

1272	But it does not matter, because on the probabilities, in my view, if a
second opinion of senior counsel had been obtained it
would not have been
obtained from Mr Bennett.  
<P>

1273	Mr Bennett had given advice to the NRMA in 1991 concerning requisitioning
of meetings, and instructions were given in early
November 1993 to brief him to
advise on class rights in connection with the proposal.  He was so briefed in
early December 1993.
 He was one of four counsel identified as a panel of
senior counsel who might be retained to advise as required throughout 1994 in
relation to the proposal, the other counsel including Mr Emmett.  But Mr
Bennett was not briefed in relation to the proposal, at
least until he appeared
for the NRMA before the Full Court of the Federal Court, while Mr Emmett was.
Indeed, as I have earlier recorded,
a brief was delivered to Mr Emmett in
December 1993 in the same terms as the revised brief to Mr Heydon delivered on
15 or 16 December
1993, and the admittedly obscure reference in 1994 to a "big
brief to Heydon and Emmett" shows that Mr Emmett was still in AAH's
mind as the
additional or alternative counsel to Mr Heydon.  
<P>

1274	If a second opinion were required, the natural thing would have been to
obtain it from Mr Emmett, particularly when Mr Emmett
had been counsel in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> in the Court of Appeal.  On the probabilities, Mr Emmett
rather than Mr Bennett would have provided the second opinion postulated
by
AAH, or at the least it would be no more than speculation to say that Mr
Bennett would have provided it rather than Mr Emmett
(or Mr Jackson, the fourth
member of the panel to which I have referred). 
<P>

1275	I do not think it realistic to find that there would have been an
immediate decision by the boards to postpone the proposal
on 17 March 1994.  It
is likely that the boards would have asked for an explanation of the advice
which I consider Mr Heydon should
have given, and would have been told of
something like the reasoning which I outlined when dealing with negligence.
The boards would
also have been told that the appeal was to be heard on 21
April 1994, and in my view the probability is that they would have put
off
their decision until after the hearing of the appeal in order that the lawyers
might give further advice with the benefit of
the transcript of the argument at
the hearing.  Regard to the transcript of the argument would have heightened
concern about following
the resolutions in general meetings route.  In my
opinion, the boards would have voted to defer the proposal on or around 28
April
1994, and the resolutions would have been to the effect that further
steps in the proposal other than limited activity by management
to further
develop it should be deferred until the decision of the High Court was
known.
<P>

1276	I referred earlier to some artificiality in the NRMA's case on causation,
including in that the boards might have thought that
the scheme of arrangement
route was preferable to delaying the proposal for an unknown period.  I said
that in the course of the
evidence the defendants did not seek to meet the
NRMA's case as presented by it by cross-examination of the NRMA's witnesses to
suggest
that the NRMA would have proceeded with the proposal but by the scheme
of arrangement route, and that the issue between the parties
was whether or
not, if the Gambotto advice had been given, the NRMA would have put the
proposal on hold and so avoided wasted expenditure.
 
<P>

1277	In submissions AT said that, if the NRMA had been advised of the risk
posed by the pending High Court appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, it ought to
have been advised that it was possible to avoid that risk by proceeding by a
scheme of arrangement, and that it should
be found that the boards would have
gone to the members with a scheme of arrangement.  The point of the submission
was that it was
then said that the damages would be not the expenditure after
the proposal would have been put on hold, but that expenditure less
what would
have been spent in putting a scheme of arrangement before the members -
according to the submission, perhaps with no damages.
<P>

1278	It is not necessary to consider the validity of the reasoning of allowance
for expenditure on putting a scheme of arrangement
before the members.  From
the tabulation of their positions, it can be seen that some of the directors
would have considered other
ways of proceeding.  A number of transcript
references were given said to be evidence of "attitudes to Gambotto risk and
scheme of
arrangement", but they did not constitute cross-examination of the
nature described above.  Mr Mackay, whose views would have carried
weight,
thought that the scheme of arrangement route would be more difficult than the
resolutions in general meetings route because
it would have given any minority
dissidents a platform, not just Mr Talbot, with possibly a number of separate
class meetings and
the need for majority approval at each meeting.  As he
correctly saw, this could lessen the prospects of success.  There was other
evidence to this effect.
<P>

1279	I doubt that it is open to AT to seek the finding I have mentioned when
the issue was not adequately made part of the proceedings,
but in any event I
am not satisfied, on the at best tangential material on which the submission
can be founded, that the collegiate
decision would have been to proceed by the
scheme of arrangement route rather than put the proposal on hold.  The aversion
to a scheme
of arrangement whereby a platform would be given to opponents was
great.  The questions to Dr Werner notwithstanding, and despite
the grounds for
many of the directors to wish to press on with the proposal, I consider on the
probabilities that the boards would
not have so decided.  I come to that view
with more comfort when taking the scheme of arrangement route was not squarely
put to the
directors.
<P>

1280	I conclude that, if the Gambotto advice had been given, in which I
comprehend the advice which I consider Mr Heydon should
have given, the NRMA
would not have incurred most of the expenditure on the proposal which it in
fact incurred after 28 April 1994,
that is, expenditure other than for the
limited further development, and that the Gambotto negligence which I have
found caused loss
to the NRMA accordingly. 
<P>

	<b>Defences</b>
<P>

1281	Causation was for the NRMA to prove, but neither issue of causation
specifically raised remained.
<P>

1282	As to causation by the supervening decision of the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, the loss was because the NRMA incurred expenditure
which it would not have incurred if the proposal had been put on hold.  It was
really not a case of wasted expenditure, that is, expenditure wasted because
the purpose of the expenditure was not achieved.  There
was no question of loss
because of the decision of the High Court.  
<P>

1283	The problem lay in the NRMA's continued description, inappropriately in
the case of Gambotto liability, of wasted expenditure.
 So the defendants said
that the expenditure, if incurred, would have been wasted anyway with the
abandonment of the proposal because
of the decision of the High Court.  I do
not think that is a correct approach to causation in relation to Gambotto
liability.  Addressing
it in the terms put forward by the parties, had the
proposal been put on hold pending the decision of the High Court I am satisfied
that it would have been abandoned as in fact occurred in 1995.  Additional
matters contributed to the then abandonment, which would
not have arisen if the
proposal had been put on hold, at least in the form they took (for example
adverse perceptions flowing from
the Federal Court proceedings).  But the
advice that <i>Gambotto's case</i> was an obstacle to implementation by
resolutions in general meetings was firm, and in my opinion would have been
given and followed.
 Still in what I consider inappropriate terms, any loss
suffered by the NRMA was not caused by the supervening decision of the High
Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>, because the negligence exposed the NRMA to the
effect of the decision.  Put another way, the decision was not an intervening
event
breaking the chain of causation between the negligence and the loss, but
part of the chain of causation:  cf <i>Medlin v State Government Insurance
Commission</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 1</a> at 6.
<P>

1284	As to rejection of the proposal by members, that the proposal might have
been defeated at the meetings was of no consequence,
as on the findings I have
made the proposal would not have got to the meetings if the Gambotto advice had
been given.  Again most
of the expenditure which the NRMA claims as wasted
expenditure would not have been incurred.
<P>

1285	Save perhaps for s 1318(1), the defendants did not in their defences as
filed rely on exculpatory provisions of the Law in
the case of Gambotto
liability.  None of the defendants relied on s 1318(1) in submissions to meet
Gambotto liability.  
<P>

1286	As to mitigation of loss by issuing a supplementary prospectus, the NRMA
received clear advice that it could not proceed, consistently
with
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, by the resolutions in general meetings route, and it
was entitled to accept and act on that advice.  It could not be said that it
should have mitigated its loss by issuing a supplementary prospectus.  
<P>

1287	As to mitigation of loss by implementing the proposal by a scheme of
arrangement, the advice that the NRMA could not proceed,
consistently with
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, by the scheme of arrangement route was not so clear,
indeed rather to the contrary (Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri that it could not,
Mr Hulme and Professor Austin that it could).  AAH submitted that the only
expenditure recoverable was the expenditure which would
not have been of use in
an implementation of the proposal by a scheme of arrangement following the
decision of the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i>.  
<P>

1288	It was said that the issue was not one of failure to mitigate loss, but
whether loss had been suffered at all.  That can not
be accepted.  The relevant
expenditure, although claimed as wasted expenditure, was expenditure which
would not have been incurred,
and constitutes loss caused by the Gambotto
negligence.  The NRMA did not in fact take up the scheme of arrangement route,
and AAH
must contend that, in mitigation of its loss, the NRMA should have
taken it up and so should have obtained benefit from that part
of the
expenditure which was of use in implementing the proposal by a scheme of
arrangement.  
<P>

1289	The alternative of putting the proposal on hold in 1994 does not govern at
this stage, and the NRMA's conduct is judged in
the circumstances in which it
was in fact in 1995.  A plaintiff is not obliged to act otherwise than in the
ordinary course of business,
and the standard is not a high one because the
defendant is a wrongdoer (see <i>Sacher Investments Ltd v Forma Stereo
Consultants Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%201%20NSWLR%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 1 NSWLR 5</a> at 9, citing <i>Banco de Portugal v
Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%20AC%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) AC 452)</a>, and in the circumstances afflicting
the NRMA in and after March 1995 I do not think it acted unreasonably in
deciding not to proceed
with the demutualisation at all.  It was time to
regroup and reconsider, and to take account of members' concerns produced inter
alia by the failure of the demutualisation to that point.  The concerns
included that the resolutions in general meeting route had
been followed but
was denied to the NRMA, and that the proper means of demutualising was
uncertain.  
<P>

1290	The allegations of contributory negligence in the defences were
particularised in terms directed more to free shares/disadvantages
liability
than to Gambotto liability.  AAH did not, but AT and Mr Heydon did, put a
submission of contributory negligence in relation
to Gambotto liability.  Given
the decision in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i>, the solicitors can not rely on
contributory negligence to reduce their Gambotto liability for breach of
contract, and the defence
is of no value to them.  Mr Heydon can rely on
contributory negligence, since he is sued only in tort.  And <i>Astley v
Austrust Ltd</i> has settled that a plaintiff can be guilty of contributory
negligence even where the defendant should have protected the plaintiff
from
the loss suffered as a result of the defendant's breach of duty.
<P>

1291	But I can see no acceptable grounds for concluding that the NRMA was
negligent in relation to risk to the proposal in connection
with <i>Gambotto's
case</i>.  AT's submission of contributory negligence was to the effect that
the NRMA's wish to avoid a scheme of arrangement was a contributing
factor to
the loss suffered.  Mr Heydon's submission of contributory negligence was to
the effect that, although the NRMA was aware
that the proposal was susceptible
to challenge on the grounds of oppression, it chose not to obtain any advice
from its solicitors
or counsel as to whether the proposal in its final form
involved oppression by the majority of the minority, or as to the implications
of the appeal in <i>Gambotto's case</i> for the proposal.  I do not think there
was any fault on the part of the NRMA in these respects.  
<P>

1292	There could be no fault simply in wishing to avoid a scheme of
arrangement.  The NRMA sought advice on scheme or meeting, and
received advice
whereby it took the resolutions in general meetings route.  I do not see why
the NRMA for itself should have added
to or gone behind that which its external
lawyers were doing in that regard, and its internal lawyers did not have the
expertise
and to the knowledge of all concerned would not have been expected to
second guess the external lawyers.  In particular, where Mr
Bateman conveyed to
the due diligence committee that any doubt about the proposed process should be
removed, and the due diligence
committee was then provided with Mr Heydon's
opinion of 28 July 1994, without AT suggesting that doubt remained, the NRMA
was entitled
to regard the question of scheme or meeting as concluded and to
rely on the external lawyers in that regard.  
<P>


<P>

<center><b>VIII   FREE SHARES/DISADVANTAGES LIABILITY</b></center>
<P>

1293	The NRMA claimed for free shares/disadvantages liability the entirety of
the wasted expenditure, and so some millions of dollars
of expenditure incurred
prior to 28 April 1994 as well as the expenditure thereafter.  Assuming
negligence or entitlement to recover
loss by virtue of provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>
or the Law, there was considerable debate over the reasoning by which the NRMA
said it was then entitled to recover the wasted expenditure.
 I repeat again
that not all the facts described are of great moment in my decision of these
proceedings and what follows takes up
the matters leading to my conclusions on
free shares/disadvantages liability by general rather than detailed reference
to the facts
I have described, but in the light of all the facts.
<P>

<b>The Claims for Breach of Contract and Negligence</b>
<P>

1294	In accordance with the earlier description of the claims against the
defendants, save as to contributory negligence and possibly
recovery of the
wasted expenditure as damages it is not necessary to distinguish between the
claims for negligence and the claims
for breach of contract.  Again I will deal
in turn with negligence, causation, and defences.
<P>

<b>Negligence</b>
<P>

1295	The NRMA submitted that the defendants should have advised it to delete
the references to free shares in both the onsert and
the prospectus, or at
least to find a way of explaining the terminology in a manner leading to a
proper understanding of the references,
so that the prospectus was not
misleading as found by the Full Court of the Federal Court.  It contended that
the decision of the
Full Court was correct, but that even if it were not
correct the defendants negligently exposed it to the risk of the adverse result
in the Federal Court proceedings.  It was said that both Mr Heydon and the
solicitors should have so advised the NRMA on or after
2 August 1994, and that
the solicitors should have done so at an earlier unspecified time;  the
emphasis in the submissions was on
2 August 1994 as the critical date and, as
will appear, on the NRMA's case the approval of the boards on 18 August 1994
was the critical
event and earlier negligence was unnecessary in order to
recover the wasted expenditure.  
<P>

1296	What I have already said about the obligations of the lawyers to exercise
due care, skill and diligence need not be repeated.
 No evidence was led from
practitioners other than those involved at the time, as expert evidence or
otherwise, either as to any
practice relevant to the conduct of Mr Heydon or
the solicitors or of what a barrister or solicitor in their positions would
properly
have done.  What I have said in this regard in relation to Gambotto
liability is equally applicable, and the content of the duties
of care owed by
Mr Heydon and the solicitors must be found by the Court.  
<P>

1297	In relation to free shares/disadvantages liability there was not such
assistance as there was in relation to Gambotto liability
from the evidence of
Mr Bennett and the submissions from CU, ME and NS.  There was, of course, the
fact that Gummow J and the Full
Court had found that the distribution of the
prospectus and onsert was engaging in misleading conduct, but it does not
automatically
follow that the defendants were negligent.  A solicitor who
brings a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge to a task and exercises
reasonable care in carrying it out will not be liable for an error of judgment
"upon points ... of nice or doubtful construction"

be found to have made an error or given wrong advice but not to have been
negligent (<i>R &amp; T Thew Limited v Reeves (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20QB%201283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) QB 1283</a>;
<i>Trust Company of Australia Limited v Perpetual Trustees WA Limited</i> at
247).  Sufficient has appeared in relating the opinions given by Mr Garnsey and
Mr Camilleri and the course of the Federal Court
proceedings, including the not
inconsiderable differences of view between Gummow J and the Full Court, to
underline that, in many
areas of the law and the application of the law to the
facts, differing views may reasonably be held;  further, while it will always
depend on the particular facts, a lawyer may not be required to warn
experienced business clients of the possibility that his opinion,
although
firmly held, may not in fact prevail (<i>Ormindale Holdings v Ray</i> at 389;
<i>Trust Company of Australia Limited v Perpetual Trustees WA Limited</i> at
247).
<P>

1298	In its submissions the NRMA described the decision of the Full Court
relevantly as a decision that the repeated use of the
expression "free shares"
in the prospectus rendered it misleading and deceptive.  While placing great
weight on Mr Heydon's description
of the expression "free shares" as ambiguous
or worse, the NRMA's submissions recognised that the reasoning of the Full
Court was
rather different from that of Mr Heydon.  Mr Heydon saw the problem
that the shares were not free because the members were giving
up rights and
Holdings was gaining greater power in Association and Insurance.  The Full
Court saw the difficulty that the shares
were not free because there might have
been disadvantages in the proposal not sufficiently identified and elaborated
in the prospectus
(see the analysis of the judgment of the Full Court much
earlier in these reasons).  
<P>

1299	So the NRMA's submissions said that the repeated use of "free shares" in
the prospectus gave rise to lack of balance in the
prospectus, suggesting that
the memberships were of no real value, and that this was compounded by
referring to but not articulating
disadvantages and so giving the impression
that they were of no substance.  As it was summarised in the NRMA's written
submissions
-
<P>

"It was the combination of these characteristics (amongst which the dangerously
ambiguous adjective `free' played a central role)
which the plaintiffs submit
led inexorably to the Federal Court's correct characterisation of the
prospectus as misleading and deceptive.
 The prospectus lacked balance and
conveyed the false impression to the NRMA members that, whatever they might be
giving up in exchange
for the shares offered to them by Holdings, it was not
something which had any real substance or value.  These facts taken together
constitute the "free shares" negligence which is at the heart of the
plaintiff's case in these proceedings."
<P>

1300	Even this did not in my view fully reflect the basis of the decision of
the Full Court in relation to free shares and disadvantages,
but it was
markedly different from the basis for the concern earlier in 1994 over whether
the shares could be described as free shares,
and from the free shares problem
identified by Mr Heydon in August 1994.  In truth, the NRMA's case involved
that Mr Heydon and the
solicitors should have identified a free shares problem,
or the risk of a free shares problem, other than that which was extensively
canvassed in the evidence before me, and that their negligence lay in not
identifying the free shares problem which was found by
the Full Court rather
than in failing to advise the NRMA that the free shares problem which had been
identified by Mr Heydon should
be avoided by doing away with the expression
entirely.  Perhaps this was why the NRMA added a variant to its submissions,
that Mr
Heydon should have advised that an expert in the law of misleading
conduct should address the NRMA documentation, and that the solicitors
should
have ensured that an expert did so.  
<P>

1301	In my view, for reasons which will by now be apparent the central question
is whether the exercise of reasonable care, skill
and diligence require that Mr
Heydon and the solicitors see that the prospectus would be misleading in
describing the shares to be
issued by Holdings as free shares because there
might have been disadvantages in the proposal not sufficiently identified and
elaborated
in the prospectus, or that there was a risk that it might be
misleading for that reason;  and that they advise the NRMA of that difficulty,
and that the description should be avoided or the difficulty, otherwise
overcome.
<P>

<b>(a)  Mr Heydon </b>
<P>

1302	In the end, and despite asserting negligence in its written submissions, I
did not understand the NRMA to rely on negligence
in advising that the shares
could be described as free in the conference on 7 March 1994.  If it did, I do
not accept that there
was negligence.  In the manner I have described, there
may have been a passing remark to the effect that the shares were capable
of
being described as free, but the occasion was not one for expression of an
opinion to guide the NRMA, and in particular was not
one in which Mr Heydon
was, or could have been expected to have been, in a position to give a
meaningful opinion on the propriety
of the description of the shares as free in
the light of the disclosure of disadvantages in the proposal.  Amongst other
reasons,
Mr Heydon had no information about the disclosure of disadvantages.

<P>

1303	On none of the occasions on which he was thereafter briefed until he came
to his opinion of 2 August 1994 was Mr Heydon even
remotely called upon to
advise in relation to the description of the shares as free shares, in the
onsert let alone in the prospectus.
 In the end, again, and despite the
particulars of negligence in the statement of claim, I did not understand the
NRMA to rely on
negligence by silence in that he did not in the conferences
after 7 March 1994 object to the description of the shares as free shares,
but
if it did I do not accept that there was negligence.  As well as not being
called on to advise in relation to the description,
Mr Heydon still had no
information about the disclosure of disadvantages.  
<P>

1304	While Mr Heydon considered it necessary for the opinion of 2 August 1994
to address the ambiguity of the word "free", the context
was quite different
from that which brought the decision of the Full Court.  It was limited to the
onsert, and, without the full
prospectus or even <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus,
Mr Heydon still did not have the information which would have enabled him even
to identify the difficulty found
by the Full Court turning upon disclosure of
disadvantages.  It would be unrealistic to say that Mr Heydon should have
recalled and
brought to his advice to the NRMA whatever he might have seen in
passing when dealing with a different matter in response to the
Perpetual
brief, and he was entitled to assume that the experienced solicitors briefing
him had a proper grasp of the overall transaction,
had deliberately briefed him
on a particular question, and could appreciate the wider implications for the
transaction, if there
were any, of his answer to the question:  cf <i>Mathew v
Maughold Life Assurance Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%203%20PN%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 3 PN 98</a> at 104-5.  
<P>

1305	Mr Heydon's advice was correct, in answer to the question which he had
been asked or even going beyond an answer to that question,
and I do not think
that the exercise of due care, skill and diligence called for him to explore
further, or advise that there should
be explored further, the use of the
description "free shares" in the prospectus, or the discussion of advantages
and disadvantages
in the prospectus so far as that might have been material to
members' assessment of the importance of their membership rights.  As
I have
said, in particular circumstances, a lawyer's duty of care may require the
taking of positive steps beyond a specifically
agreed task or function where
that is necessary to avoid a real and foreseeable risk of the client sustaining
economic loss.  But
the courts should be cautious about imposing a duty beyond
the scope of the specifically agreed task or function (<i>Hawkins v Clayton</i>
at 579;  <i>Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne</i> at 370), and I can see no proper
grounds for concluding that the circumstances required that Mr Heydon do more
than he did.
<P>

1306	The NRMA's submissions included that, when Mr Heydon held the opinion that
the entire transaction was at risk if the shares
were free, his "failure to
sound any warning signals to anyone" was a breach of his duty of care.  Mr
Heydon did warn, and the submission
in this respect was less than precise or
helpful:  presumably the NRMA meant that Mr Heydon did not warn against using
"free" in
the prospectus.  But the submission was misconceived.  
<P>

1307	As explained when dealing with how Mr Heydon's opinion should be read, his
reference to the entire transaction being at risk
if the shares were free was
not to risk because "free" was ambiguous and it would be misleading to describe
the shares as free. 
His point in the reference, no doubt coming to his mind
because of the paid-up shares question on which he had advised in conference
on
29 April 1994 and his recent confirmatory opinion of 28 July 1994, stemmed from
the fact that the shares could not be issued for
no consideration.  As I have
said, the point was really an aside that had the shares truly been free, which
they were not, they would
be issued for no consideration and the transaction
would for that reason be at risk.  This risk to which Mr Heydon referred did
not
call for warning signals, because everyone knew that the shares were not
free in that they were in exchange for membership rights.
 
<P>

1308	In my opinion, the question earlier stated should be answered in the
negative.  Mr Heydon was not negligent.  
<P>

1309	Some further aspects of the NRMA's case against Mr Heydon should be noted.

<P>

1310	First, while it was acknowledged that the case against Mr Heydon was not
one of negligence in failing to advise about lack
of balance in the prospectus,
it was said that Mr Heydon's ignorance of the contents of the prospectus was
all the more reason for
him to give careful and cautious advice about the
description of the shares as free shares, or to advise that someone should give
careful consideration to the use of the description in the prospectus.  Mr
Heydon did not know and was not in a position to know
anything about lack of
balance in the prospectus.  What he was asked about and advised about did not
call for him to question its
balance or lack of balance, and in my view this
aspect of the NRMA's submissions is fanciful.  
<P>

1311	Secondly, it was said that the asterisk and explanation approved by Mr
Heydon were deficient, in that telling the member that
the free shares the cash
alternative were in return for his existing membership effectively told the
member nothing because it said
nothing about the value of the membership rights
in money terms or otherwise, or even what the rights were.  So, it was said, Mr
Heydon should have stuck to his guns in his opinion of 3 August 1994 and
continued to advise that "free shares" should not be used.
 In my view,
however, there was nothing wrong with informing members by the asterisk and
explanation that the free shares or cash
alternative were in return for
existing memberships.  They were, and the deficiency found in the Federal Court
was a different matter,
neither one for Mr Heydon's attention nor one which he
should have thought to question. 
<P>

1312	Thirdly, and as I have already indicated, it was said that Mr Heydon's
provision of a stand alone opinion on 3 August 1994,
and the change in language
from his opinion of 2 August 1994, were "inexplicable".  I see nothing sinister
or inappropriate in what
Mr Heydon did.  Indeed, in his opinion of 3 August
1994 he did advert to risk notwithstanding the asterisk and explanation, while
saying that he thought that any dispute would be decided favourably to the
NRMA.
<P>

<b>(b)  AAH and AT</b>
<P>

1313	AAH and AT are not in the same position as Mr Heydon, since they had the
detailed knowledge of the prospectus and could have
been expected to consider
the implications beyond the onsert, if any, of the ambiguity identified by Mr
Heydon.  As what I have said
in describing the facts shows, the possible
implications were identified.  In its submissions the NRMA asserted that "the
fundamental
act of negligence by the solicitors in relation to free shares is
that they both allowed their clients to take an unwarranted and
unnecessary
risk in ignorance of its existence", meaning the risk in describing the shares
as free shares posed by the free shares
problem identified by Mr Heydon.
<P>

1314	One difficulty with such a case of negligence is that, referring to the
free shares problem identified by Mr Heydon as distinct
from the different
problem involving disclosure of disadvantages upon which the decision of the
Full Court turned, the NRMA knew,
at the least through Ms Conway, of the
existence of the risk.  To accommodate this, the negligence would have to lie
in failure sufficiently
to convey the gravity of the risk, or to draw attention
to the risk at the level of the due diligence committee or the boards.  Even
then, in the manner I have described the free shares problem identified by Mr
Heydon was made known to Mr Mackay and probably, as
the incomplete
recollections of Mr Kirby and Mr Douglass suggests, to others in the
decision-making area.  The fault, if there was
fault, lay in the 
<P>

1315	This aspect of the NRMA's case raised most directly the sign-off letters,
and was taken up again in relation to contravention
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>.  
<P>

1316	I have referred to the materiality guidelines for the due diligence
process, in substance that the prospectus should include
or comment on anything
which might affect the decision of a potential investor.  The due diligence
process included regard to breach
of legislative or other requirements, and the
sign-off letters were directed to whether the prospectus sufficiently included
or commented
on anything which might affect the decision of a potential
investor and, specifically in the case of the AAH sign-off letter, whether
there was a material false or misleading statement or material in the
prospectus.  
<P>

1317	I put aside for present purposes that the AAH sign-off letter had the
qualification that AAH had relied on the AT sign-off
letter in relation to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a>, and treat it as extending without qualification to that Section.  I
also assume for present purposes that the onsert was fully to
be regarded as
part of the prospectus, or otherwise the subject of the due diligence process
and the sign-off letters.  Did the exercise
of reasonable care, skill and
diligence, bearing in mind the nature and purpose of the due diligence process
and the materiality
guidelines and otherwise AAH's and AT's positions as
solicitors advising the NRMA, require that there be reference to the due
diligence
committee or in the sign-off letters to the free shares problem
identified by Mr Heydon?
<P>

1318	As to the onsert, by the asterisk and explanation the free shares problem
had been "cured" in accordance with Mr Heydon's opinion
of 3 August 1994.  The
changes in the onsert after he gave his opinion were such that the cure would
still be worked.  It is true
that Mr Heydon still referred to risk of readers
being led into a misapprehension and risk of successful challenge to the
document,
and said that legal issues arose from the form of the first page
although in his opinion they would be resolved favourably, but reading
the
opinion as a whole in my view that would reasonably have been seen as no more
than recognition that an ill-founded allegation
that a document is misleading
can never be precluded.  The remaining so-called risk in my view was something
different from and of
little consequence in comparison to a risk such as that
posed to the basic means of implementing the proposal by the appeal to the
High
Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>:  as Ms Conway said in her evidence, it was one
of the many issues which came up and was dealt with, and things moved on.  
<P>

1319	There had to be some exercise of judgment as to what should specifically
be brought to the attention of the due diligence committee,
or mentioned in the
sign-off letters as something considered but discarded as an impediment to the
opinions in the sign-off letters.
 Otherwise there would have been no end to
the meetings of the due diligence committee or the pages of the sign-off
letters, given
the myriad of legal and other issues, on a spectrum of
significance, which had arisen.  In my opinion the implicit judgment exercised
by Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman was reasonable, and the exercise of due care, skill
and diligence did not call for reference to the free
shares problem identified
by Mr Heydon in relation to the onsert.
<P>

1320	As to the prospectus, whether the free shares problem identified by Mr
Heydon affected the use of the description of free shares
in the prospectus was
raised at the meeting on the afternoon of 2 August 1994, and Mr Morgan said in
substance that it did not; 
Mr Bateman did not say anything to the contrary.
The matter came up again, less directly, on 7 August 1994.  It was thought that
the prospectus was not affected by the free shares problem identified by Mr
Heydon because it described the transaction and made
sufficiently clear to
members that they were giving up their membership rights, quite apart from any
disagreement from Mr Morgan
with Mr Heydon's view and any different perception
by Mr Bateman of the free shares problem.  Following the opinions of Mr Heydon,
if it was sufficiently made clear that the members were giving up their
membership rights, the description of the shares in the prospectus
as free
shares - more as Free Shares, the defined term - would not continue to have the
ambiguity to which Mr Heydon referred.
<P>

1321	In my opinion it was open to AAH and AT reasonably to conclude, as they
did, that it was sufficiently made clear.  The purpose
of the transaction was
to change the NRMA's structure.  A diagram showed the new structure, with
Holdings wholly owning Association
and Insurance.  Members would receive shares
or cash.  This strongly pointed to a change by which the positions of members
as members
would go, and they would either become shareholders in Holdings or
take cash.  In the part of the prospectus against the heading
"Legal Steps
Involved in Change", a part to which members could be expected to go to find
out more, it was said expressly that members
would cease to be members, and
that the central element of the new articles "means that members (other than
NRMA Holdings) agree
to give up their membership of the Association and NRMA
Insurance on condition that Free Shares are offered by NRMA Holdings".  The
notices of meeting, another part to which members could be expected to go to
find out more, said expressly that as part of the legal
changes members would
no longer be members (but road service would be provided under contract) on
condition that Free Shares in Holdings
were offered by it.  With the utmost
respect to Gummow J and the members of the Full Court, to the extent to which
they found these
passages overwhelmed by the repetition of the description of
Free Shares I take a different view, but of present significance I do
not think
there was a failure in the exercise of due care, skill and diligence when AAH
and AT thought that the prospectus did not
suffer from the free shares problem
identified by Mr Heydon.
<P>

1322	For reasons similar to those given in relation to the onsert, then, I do
not think that it was necessary for the solicitors
to bring to the attention of
the due diligence committee, or refer in the sign-off letters to, the possible
flow-on of the free shares
problem identified by Mr Heydon to the prospectus.
The question had been raised, it had been considered, and it was reasonably
thought
that the prospectus was nonetheless satisfactory.  The implicit
judgment in my opinion was again reasonable, and the exercise of
due care,
skill and diligence did not call for reference to the free shares problem
identified by Mr Heydon in relation to the prospectus.
<P>

1323	While I would be of these opinions in any event, it should not be
forgotten that Ms Conway knew what Mr Heydon had said in
his opinions of 2 and
3 August 1994, had been closely involved in addressing the free shares problem
he had identified, had considered
the drafts of the sign-off letters, and was
the NRMA's senior legal officer with fairly close contact with the due
diligence committee
and the boards.  She did not think it necessary to do more
than convey what Mr Heydon had advised in the manner I have described
when
saying that the free shares problem was not hidden.  When Ms Conway did not see
default on the part of the solicitors in allowing
the NRMA to take an
unwarranted and unnecessary risk in ignorance of its existence, I am comforted
in my own opinions.  
<P>

1324	Equally as an aside, for present purposes, it may be noted that Mr Mackay
as an experienced solicitor and businessman read
the prospectus with a view,
amongst other things, to satisfying himself that members were aware from the
prospectus that they were
giving up their membership and receiving shares or
cash in place of membership, and independently satisfied himself as to that.
Evidence
to the same effect was given by Mr Douglass, who also said that that
was one of the reasons he accepted the advice he was given (apparently
meaning
advice of one or more of the defendants), Mrs Callaghan (although she said that
at the time she did not relate it to whether
the shares were free), probably Mr
Easson (it was less direct), probably Ms Ralph, possibly Mr Kirby, Dame Leonie
Kramer, and Mr
Farr-Jones.  That does not bind a court, or necessarily preclude
negligence by the solicitors.  But it gives pause for thought before
finding
that the solicitors were negligence in their similar conclusions.
<P>

1325	The more fundamental difficulty in the NRMA's case of negligence against
the solicitors, however, is that (as earlier explained)
the NRMA's case in
truth involved that the solicitors should have identified a free shares
problem, or the risk of a free shares
problem, different from that identified
by Mr Heydon.  The true question, partially recognised elsewhere in the NRMA's
submissions,
was whether, in the exercise of due care, skill and diligence, the
solicitors should have seen that it was misleading to describe
the shares to be
issued by Holdings as free shares because there might have been disadvantages
in the proposal not sufficiently identified
and elaborated in the prospectus,
or that there was a risk of that being found.
<P>

1326	I here return to my respectful difficulties with the reasons of the Full
Court.  To answer the question in the affirmative,
it would have to be
concluded that AAH and AT knew or should have known of disadvantages, which
might be thought significant in relation
to the exchange of rights and were not
sufficiently identified and elaborated in the prospectus.  
<P>

1327	Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman had seen and participated in extensive
discussions of disadvantages, in particular when the question
of a "no" case
came up, and from their perception the directors of the NRMA must have been
satisfied that all relevant disadvantages
had been disclosed and adequately
described.  The evidence showed that the directors who gave evidence were so
satisfied, save that
Mr Corrigan said that he held the view (from his evidence,
an indistinct and qualified view) that insurance premiums might increase
following demutualisation.  Mr Corrigan probably did not make his view known,
and he approved <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus.  Mr Jack said that he thought
there was a slight risk that premiums might increase, but he regarded it as
immaterial.
 There was no suggestion that he made his view known, and he also
approved <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1</a> of the prospectus.  I am not persuaded that Mr Morgan and Mr
Bateman should have taken a different view, or seen a risk that a different
view would be taken calling for advice to reword the prospectus in a manner
which would better identify and elaborate disadvantages
so as to remove any
difficulty in describing the shares as free shares.
<P>

1328	While AAH and AT had to consider the implications of Mr Heydon's advice
beyond the onsert, I do not think that they fell short
of the standard of care
required even of solicitors proficient in the relevant field of expertise in
failing to see the rather different
basis for misleading conduct found by the
Full Court.  For the present the correctness of the decision of the Full Court
in this
respect does not matter, if for no other reason because the negligence
alleged against AAH and AT includes failure to advise of the
risk of that which
the Full Court found, but the difficulties I have expressed in relation to the
decision of the Full Court are
such that, notwithstanding the fact of the
decision, I do not think the risk was something which should have occurred to
the solicitors.
 
<P>

1329	While I would be of this view in any event, it is not without significance
that the basis of misleading conduct found by the
Full Court is not clearly to
be found in the opinion of Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri of 19 September 1994,
which in relation to the
description of the shares as free found the price of
the shares in giving up membership associated with disproportionate allocation
of Insurance's net worth.  This was also different from the free shares problem
identified by Mr Heydon, and Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri
did not so far as
their opinion shows consider whether the prospectus sufficiently made clear
that members were giving up their membership
rights.
<P>

<b>Causation</b>
<P>

1330	In the absence of negligence, there can be no free shares/disadvantages
liability for negligence.  In case I am incorrect in
what I have said, I
propose to deal also with causation.  My conclusions as to causation will be
material also to proof of loss in
the claims for contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>,
involvement in Holdings' contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, and contraventions of s
995(2) and 996(1) of the Law.
<P>

1331	The NRMA's case in submissions was that, had the defendants advised it to
delete the references to free shares in both the
onsert and the prospectus, or
appropriately qualify that expression, the boards would not have approved the
issue of the prospectus
in the form found by the Federal Court to be
misleading;  so its expenditure "would have resulted in the proposal being put
to the
members lawfully" and, it was said, the NRMA "would not have suffered
the loss [it] did when [it was] enjoined by the Federal Court".
 
<P>

1332	There were two steps in the NRMA's argument from negligence to recovery of
the wasted expenditure.  One was that, had the NRMA
been properly advised,
distribution of the prospectus and onsert would not have constituted engaging
in misleading conduct, because
the boards would not have approved the
prospectus in the form in which it was in fact issued.  The other was that
<u>for that reason alone</u> the wasted expenditure was recoverable, regardless
of whether the proposal would then have been put to the members or endorsed by
sufficient majorities of members in general meetings.  The second step in
particular excited the debate to which I referred when
first embarking on free
shares/disadvantages liability, but the first was not free from dispute.  
<P>

1333	It must first be said that, for reasons I have explained, concentration on
use of the words "free shares" obscures that the
vice as later found in the
prospectus, which really turned on its treatment of disadvantages.  And again
there was some artificiality
in the case as put for the NRMA.  Had Mr Heydon or
the solicitors advised that the phrase "free shares" should be avoided entirely
in the prospectus or that an explanation should be included to make clear that
the price for the shares was giving up membership
and suffering a comprehensive
collection of disadvantages, or in some other way addressed the basis for
misleading conduct later
found, management may well have ensured that the
prospectus was put before the boards in an appropriate form.  What would have
happened
would perhaps have depended on when the advice was given and the then
state of the draft prospectus, but it might be thought unlikely
that the boards
would have been presented with the option of approving a prospectus which
management had been advised was deficient.
 If it were necessary for the NRMA
to prove how it would have acted in response to the advice which it said should
have been given,
management rather than the directors could have been expected
to give evidence.  
<P>

1334	The NRMA did not call evidence of how it would have reacted to the advice
which it said should have been given, from either
management or the directors.
The NRMA did lead evidence from directors, in various forms of words, to the
effect that they relied
on the sign-off letters or on knowledge of the due
diligence process and the involvement of the solicitors, and I will come to
that
evidence, but this fell short of evidence that the advice which the NRMA
said should have been given would have been acted upon and
how it would have
been acted upon.  In particular, it fell short of evidence that the boards
would not have approved the issue of
the prospectus in the form found by the
Federal Court to be misleading.  The question was not academic, given the
perceived advantage
in "selling" the proposal of the notion of free shares, and
the stance of the defendants that a majority of the directors were so
intent on
implementing the proposal that they were prepared to run risks. 
<P>

1335	The NRMA submitted that it was unnecessary in law for it to lead evidence
of this kind;  indeed, it took the submission into
the area of the second step
to which I have referred, and said that what would have happened if the advice
had been given was irrelevant
to its recovery of the wasted expenditure.  It
relied on <i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i> (1998) Ch 1.  
<P>

1336	The society offered to advance money for the purchase of a house, on the
express condition that the balance of the purchase
price was provided by the
purchasers without resort to further borrowing.  It instructed its solicitor to
report prior to completion
any proposal that the purchasers might create a
second mortgage or otherwise borrow in order to finance part of the purchase
price.
 The solicitor knew that the purchasers were arranging for an existing
bank debt to be secured by a second charge on the property,
but due to an
oversight reported that the balance of the purchase price was being provided by
the purchasers without resort to further
borrowing.  The society made the loan.
The purchasers defaulted.  The society enforced its security, and the house was
sold at a
loss.  
<P>

1337	The society claimed damages from its solicitor.  It claimed the whole of
its loss on the transaction, and submitted that it
was entitled to recover the
loss without having to establish that it would not have proceeded with the
transaction if it had been
informed of the facts.  Millett LJ said (at 11) -
<P>

"In the present case the society's claim is not for misrepresentation.
Accordingly, questions of inducement and materiality are
not relevant.  Its
claim lies in negligence, and the relevant concept is reliance.  In considering
the issue of causation in an action
for negligence brought by a client against
his solicitor it appears from <i>Downs v Chappell</i> [(1977) 1 WLR 426] that
it is necessary to distinguish between two different kinds of case.
<P>

Where a client sues his solicitor for having negligently failed to give him
proper advice, he must show what advice should have
been given and (on a
balance of probabilities) that if such advice had been given he would not have
entered into the relevant transaction
or would not have entered into it on the
terms he did.  The same applies where the client's complaint is that the
solicitor failed
in his duty to give him material information.  In <i>Sykes v
Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20QB%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 QB 113</a>, which was
concerned with a failure to give proper advice, the plaintiff was unable to
establish this and his claim to damages for
negligence failed.  In <i>Mortgage
Express Ltd v Bowerman &amp; Partners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20All%20ER%20836" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 All ER 836</a>, which was
concerned with a failure to convey information, the plaintiff was able to
establish that if it had been given the information
it would have withdrawn
from the transaction and its claim succeeded.
<P>

Where, however, a client sues his solicitor for having negligently given him
incorrect advice or for having negligently given him
incorrect information, the
position appears to be different.  In such a case it is sufficient for the
plaintiff to prove that he
relied on the advice or information, that is to say,
that he would not have acted as he did if he had not been given such advice
or
information.  It is not necessary for him to prove that he would not have acted
as he did if he had been given the proper advice
or the correct information.
This was the position in<i> Downs v Chappel</i>.
<P>

In the present case the society makes complaints of both kinds.  It alleges
that the defendant negligently and in breach of his
instructions failed to
report the purchasers' proposed arrangements with the bank prior to completion.
This is a claim of the first
kind, and if it were all the society would have to
establish that if it had been informed of those arrangements it would not have
proceeded with the mortgage advance.  But the defendant went further than this.
He did not merely fail to report the arrangements
to the society;  he expressly
represented to the society that no such arrangements existed.  That brings the
case within the second
category.  It follows from the decision of this court in
<i>Downs v Chappell</i> that it is sufficient for the society to prove that it
relied on the representations in the report.  Although the judge spoke in
terms
of inducement, he plainly found reliance.  The society's procedures were
designed to ensure that no cheque would be issued
in the absence of a
satisfactory report from its solicitor.
<P>

In my judgment we are bound by the decision in <i>Downs v Chappell</i> to hold
that the necessary causal link between the defendant's negligence and the
mortgage advance was proved."
<P>

1338	The NRMA drew from this that in the case of a negligent failure to advise
the client must prove what he would have done had
the correct advice been
given, but in the case of a negligent giving of advice it was sufficient for
the client to prove that he
would not have acted as he did but for the advice,
without having to prove what he would have done if the correct advice had been
given.  So, it said, in the present case the defendants negligently gave
incorrect advice, and it was unnecessary for the NRMA to
prove what would have
happened if the correct advice had been given.
<P>

1339	The validity of the distinction has been questioned, see <i>Tanna v
Deutsche Bank (Asia) AG</i> (NSWCA, 15 September 1998, unreported, per Powell
JA;  Hodgson,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2071%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 71 ALJ 596-7).</a>   Failure to give proper advice and giving
incorrect advice may merge into each other, and most cases of negligently
giving incorrect
advice can be seen as cases of negligently failing to give
proper advice:  so the two different kinds of case are not so different.
 In
either event, in order to prove that the negligence caused the loss in question
it may be necessary to prove what the client
would have done had there had been
proper advice or had there not been incorrect advice, depending on the facts
and the way in which
it is said that loss was suffered.  If the facts are such
that a solicitor acting properly should have given no advice at all, it
may be
enough for the client to prove that he would not have acted as he did but for
the advice, but if the solicitor acting properly
should have given different
advice it may be necessary for the client to prove what he would have done if
the different advice had
been given.
<P>

1340	In any case, reliance in the abstract is meaningless:  there must be
reliance causing or contributing to doing or not doing
something.  On the facts
in <i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i>, the reliance was in
making the loan.  Whatever be the validity of the distinction, all Millett LJ
was saying was that express evidence
that the society would not have made the
loan if it had been informed of the facts was unnecessary, and his Lordship was
not denying
that the loss claimed had to have been caused by the negligence.  I
do not read his Lordship's observations as making irrelevant
inquiry into the
relationship between the NRMA's conduct in August 1994 and the characterisation
of the expenditure as wasted expenditure.
 That which it is not necessary for
the NRMA to prove, in the second case postulated by Millett LJ, is the proper
advice and what
the NRMA would have done;  that does not affect proof of the
loss caused by its acting as it did in reliance on the incorrect advice,
that
is, that the wasted expenditure was wasted expenditure because of the
defendants' negligence.  I return to the second step in
the NRMA's case on
causation shortly.
<P>

1341	As to the first step, however, I do not think the distinction drawn in
<i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew </i>affects the result.  That is
so because, to return to 18 August 1994, even in the absence of direct evidence
from the directors I
am satisfied that, had AAH, AT or Mr Heydon advised that
the expression "free shares" should not be used in the prospectus, they
would
have accepted the advice and ensured that the prospectus was appropriately
amended;  had AAH, AT or Mr Heydon advised them
that more comprehensive
spelling out of the disadvantages was necessary in order to make clear their
possible significance to members
in deciding how to vote and whether to accept
the shares, that also would have been done.  The proposal would not have been
called
off.  The two choices would have been to proceed with the prospectus as
it was, or to amend the prospectus to accommodate the advice,
and the later
course would have been followed.
<P>

1342	Without doubt there was a perceived advantage, and a significant one, in
describing the shares as free shares, and the NRMA
would have been reluctant to
forego it.  To the extent to which I have described, there was a desire in the
majority to see the proposal
implemented, and they would have been particularly
reluctant to forego the advantage because approval of the proposal in the
general
meetings was by no means assured and might be endangered by loss of the
advantage.  As can be seen from the attention given to it
in the development of
the proposal, there was a disinclination to emphasise the disadvantages of the
proposal, although in my view
not such as to inhibit compliance with advice of
the kind I have postulated.  
<P>

1343	But it seems to me that, in a similar manner as in relation to the
Gambotto negligence, the directors would not have been inclined
or prepared to
act contrary to the advice, if for no other reason than because to do so would
be contrary to what they perceived
to be the interests of the NRMA and their
own interests.  The due diligence process would have thrown up the advice, and
they could
not have afforded to proceed contrary to the advice.  To do so would
have exposed the NRMA to attack at the hands of the opponents
of the proposal,
with potential detrimental consequences to the success of the proposal, and
would have exposed themselves to similar
attack.  At worst, there could be the
calumny of successful action by the opponents.  In referring to self interest I
do not mean
that the actions of the directors would have been governed by self
interest, and I accept that in their own ways each had the interests
of the
NRMA at heart and acted accordingly, but self interest would have added to the
constraint against ignoring the advice. 
<P>

1344	My conclusion does not rest upon whether the sign-off letters were tabled
or read at the board meetings on 18 August 1994 or
at the due diligence
committee meetings on and shortly before that day, or wholly on the evidence of
the directors, in some respects
rather unsatisfactory, of general reliance on
the solicitors.  
<P>

1345	I have described the evidence concerning the tabling and reading of the
sign-off letters earlier in these reasons.  The evidence
of reliance on the
solicitors was of different kinds.  Some directors who undoubtedly read the
sign-off letters said that they relied
on the solicitors in deciding to support
the resolution to adopt and approve the report of the due diligence committee
or the resolutions
in favour of the proposal at the board meetings.  Most
directors gave evidence that they were not aware of any advice or opinion
of
AAH or AT to the effect that the prospectus was deficient in relation to free
shares and disadvantages or in relation to compliance
with the general law
concerning material to be supplied to members (the formulaic words commonly
used were lengthy, and need not
be set out), and that they would not have voted
in favour of the proposal in August 1994 had they been advised to that effect.
Most
directors gave evidence at further remove, to the effect that they were
aware of AAH and AT as leading commercial solicitors and
relied on their
involvement in the formulation and implementation of the proposal as some
assurance of its legal integrity (again
the formula commonly used was lengthy,
and perhaps less direct than my summary).  
<P>

1346	I do not think it is necessary to go through the directors individually,
or further to detail and refine the evidence of this
kind.  As a matter of
common sense, the directors knew that the solicitors were closely involved in
the drafting of the prospectus
and in the supervision of the due diligence
committee, and would have expected that any deficiencies in the content of the
prospectus
which the exercise of due care, skill and diligence called for the
solicitors to guard against would have been made known, and that
advice as to
the nature and extent of deficiencies of that kind, the risks they posed, and
the means of overcoming them, would have
been given.  Absence of such advice
from AAH and AT, as much as the terms of the sign-off letters, gave rise to
reliance by the NRMA
on the solicitors.  
<P>

1347	Of more significance was the second step in the NRMA's argument from
negligence to recovery of the wasted expenditure.  How,
beyond its reliance on
<i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i>,<i> </i>did the NRMA claim
the wasted expenditure as damages for negligence?  
<P>

1348	Earlier in these reasons I said that, while in the points of claim the
loss in the amount of the wasted expenditure was claimed
globally, in
submissions there was late modification by the NRMA to the claim that part of
the wasted expenditure would be recoverable
as such, and that other of the
wasted expenditure would be recoverable on a different basis.  But the
modification was late and limited,
and until then in the manner the NRMA
conducted its case it contended that it could recover all its expenditure on
the proposal as
wasted expenditure.  Further, it said that it could recover the
expenditure whether or not the proposal would have been approved
by the members
at the general meetings.  
<P>

1349	The defendants, on the other hand, said that the expenditure prior to 18
August 1994 could not have been caused by negligence
on their part affecting
the NRMA's conduct only on 18 August 1994, and that in any event the
expenditure both before and after 18
August 1994 would have been wasted anyway
because the proposal would not have been approved by the members in general
meeting.  The
defendants said, more fundamentally, that the claim for loss in
the amount of the wasted expenditure was flawed, because the claimable
loss was
the difference in money terms between the NRMA demutualised and the NRMA under
its present structure, or at least the difference
between its position if a
prospectus free from the deficiencies as to free shares and disadvantages had
been distributed and its
position when enjoined from distribution of the
prospectus as approved on 18 August 1994.  The NRMA did not attempt to make out
a
case of loss arrived at in that way, and so, said the defendants, it had not
proved loss.
<P>

1350	The NRMA stated unequivocally that it did not claim damages for loss of a
chance.  It claimed the entirety of the wasted expenditure,
not some part of
the expenditure turning on an assessment of the prospects of demutualisation if
proper advice had been given.  To
adapt the words of Gummow J in <i>Chappel v
Hart</i> at paras 75-76, it did not allege that it contracted for the benefit
of a chance of avoiding waste of the expenditure, or that the
deprivation of
the chance of benefit from the expenditure was an acceptable substitute for the
entire benefit, and it did not seek
damages for the loss of an opportunity or
chance to acquire or receive a benefit with a value to be ascertained by
reference to the
degree of probabilities or possibilities.  It claimed the
entirety of the wasted expenditure, not as expenditure which was wasted
because
it should not have been incurred, but as expenditure which was wasted because
the purpose of the expenditure was not achieved.
 
<P>

1351	Critical to the NRMA's claim was what it said was the reasoning of the
High Court in <i>McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 79</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2084%20CLR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 84 CLR
377</a> (<i>McRae's case</i>).  
<P>

1352	The Commission invited tenders for the purchase of an oil tanker lying on
Jourmaund Reef.  McRae tendered, and his tender was
accepted.  A sales advice
note described what was sold as an oil tanker including contents wrecked on
Jourmaund Reef.  McRae fitted
out a salvage expedition and proceeded to the
locality where the tanker was alleged to be lying, but could not find the
tanker, and
in fact there was no tanker in that locality.  It was held that
McRae was entitled to recover damages for breach of contract, and
that the
damages were the purchase price plus the expenditure wasted in reliance on the
promise that there was a tanker at the given
locality.  The principal judgment
was a joint judgment of Dixon and Fullagar JJ;  McTiernan J delivered a short
concurring judgment.
 
<P>

1353	Their Honours rejected the argument that there had only been a purported
contract nullified by mistake, and held that there
was a contract in which the
Commission promised that a tanker existed in the position specified.  The
promise had been broken:  "Since
there was no such tanker, there has been a
breach of contract, and the plaintiffs are entitled to damages for that breach"
(at 410).
 
<P>

1354	What were the damages?  Damages for non-delivery of goods could not be
assessed, because it was impossible to place a value
on what the Commission had
purported to sell.  Their Honours continued -
<P>

"There is, however, more in this case than that, and the truth is that to
regard this case as a simple case of breach of contract
by non-delivery of
goods would be to take an unreal and misleading view of it.  The practical
substance of the case lies in these
three factors - (1) the Commission promised
that there was a tanker at or near to the specified place;  (2) in reliance on
that promise
the plaintiffs expended considerable sums of money;  (3) there was
in fact no tanker at or anywhere near to the specified place.
 In the waste of
their considerable expenditure seems to lie the real and understandable
grievance of the plaintiffs, and the ultimate
question in the case (apart from
any question of quantum) is whether the plaintiffs can recover the amount of
this wasted expenditure
or any part of it as damages for breach of the
Commission's contract that there was a tanker in existence."
<P>

1355	After concluding that it was reasonable for McRae to assume that there was
a tanker in the locality given, and to undertake
the salvage operations, their
Honours said -
<P>

"There is, however, still another question. Mr Tait not only strongly opposed
the view so far expressed, but he also contended that,
even if that view were
accepted, it still could not be held that the alleged damage flowed from the
alleged breach.  Let it be supposed,
he said in effect, that the plaintiffs
acted reasonably in what they did, and let it be supposed that the Commission
ought reasonably
to have contemplated that they would so act.  Still, he said,
the plaintiffs are faced with precisely the same difficulty with which
they are
faced if the case is regarded as a simple and normal case of breach by
non-delivery.  Suppose there had been a tanker at
the place indicated.  <i>Non
constat</i> that the expenditure incurred by the plaintiffs would not have been
equally wasted.  If the promise that there was a tanker <i>in situ</i> had been
performed, she might still have been found worthless or not susceptible of
profitable salvage operations or of any salvage
operations at all.  How, then,
he asked, can the plaintiffs say that their expenditure was <i>wasted
because</i> there was no tanker in existence? 
<P>

The argument is far from being negligible.  But it is really, we think,
fallacious.  If we regard the case as a simple and normal
case of breach by
non-delivery, the plaintiffs have no starting point.  The burden of proof is on
them, and they cannot establish
that they have suffered any damage unless they
can show that a tanker delivered in performance of the contract would have had
some
value, and this they cannot show.  But when the contract alleged is a
contract that there was a tanker in a particular place, and
the breach assigned
is that there was no tanker there, and the damages claimed are measured by
expenditure incurred on the faith
of the promise that there was a tanker in
that place, the plaintiffs are in a very different position.  They have now a
starting
point.  They can say:  (1) this expense was incurred;  (2) it was
incurred because you promised us that there was a tanker;  (3)
the fact that
there was no tanker made it certain that this expense would be wasted.  The
plaintiffs have in this way a starting-point.
 They make a prima facie case.
The fact that the expense was wasted flowed prima facie from the fact that
there was no tanker;  and
the first fact is damage, and the second fact is
breach of contract.  The burden is now thrown on the Commission of establishing
that, if there had been a tanker, the expense incurred would equally have been
wasted.  This, of course, the Commission cannot establish.
 The fact is that
the impossibility of assessing damages on the basis of a comparison between
what was promised and what was delivered
arises not because what was promised
was valueless but because it is impossible to value a non-existent thing.  It
is the breach
of contract itself which makes it impossible even to undertake an
assessment on that basis.  It is not impossible, however, to undertake
an
assessment on another basis, and, in so far as the Commission's breach of
contract itself reduces the possibility of an accurate
assessment, it is not
for the Commission to complain.
<P>

For these reasons we are of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to
recover damages in this case for breach of contract, and
that their damages are
to be measured by reference to expenditure incurred and wasted in reliance on
the Commission's promise that
a tanker existed at the place specified.  The
only problem now remaining is to quantify those damages ...".
<P>

1356	In the NRMA's submission, the fact that the opportunity lost by a
defendant's breach of duty is difficult to value does not
mean that the
plaintiff is left without a remedy.  The plaintiff may sue in the alternative
for the expenditure wasted in pursuing
the opportunity, provided it was the
defendant's breach of duty which caused that expenditure to be incurred and
wasted.  The submission
did include that the breach of duty caused the
expenditure to be incurred).  What the NRMA said was the reasoning of the High
Court
was applied by it by saying that the defendants owed duties to the NRMA
in contract and tort to exercise reasonable care, skill and
diligence to ensure
that the NRMA was given the opportunity lawfully to put the demutualisation
proposal to its members;  that in
breach of their duties, the defendants
allowed inherent defects to be included in the documentation for the proposal,
which defects
ultimately came to fruition and destroyed the transaction;  that
it might have been possible for the NRMA to sue for the lost opportunity
of
demutualising, but it chose not to claim for such a loss;  that instead, as in
<i>McRae's case</i>, it sued for wasted expenditure only;  and that, as in
<i>McRae's case,</i> it was entitled to recover the wasted expenditure.  
<P>

1357	It had to be said that this application of what the NRMA said was the
reasoning of the High Court paid little regard to what
the High Court had said,
and no regard to later consideration of <i>McRae's case</i>.  The NRMA's
submission was by way of assertion rather than structured argument.  Even if
the reliance on <i>McRae's case</i> could have brought recovery of wasted
expenditure, it is questionable whether it could have brought recovery of
expenditure after
(in broad terms) the decision of the Full Court, because that
expenditure would not be wasted expenditure of the kind in <i>McRae's case</i>.
But I do not think that <i>McRae's case</i> takes the NRMA to recovery of the
wasted expenditure at all.  
<P>

1358	<i>McRae's case</i> was considered and explained in <i>Commonwealth of
Australia v Amann Aviation Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 64.</a>  The general rule
was affirmed that damages for breach of contract should so far as money can do
so place the plaintiff in the position
he would have been in had the contract
been performed (the <i>Robinson v Harman</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1848/135.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1848] EngR 135</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281848%29%201%20Exch%20850" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1848) 1 Ex 850</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=154%20ER%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">154 ER 363</a>
principle).  Damages for expenditure reasonably incurred are a manifestation of
that principle, and so damages for expenditure reasonably
incurred are
available only to the extent to which, had the contract been performed, the
expenditure would have been recouped.  Where
it is not possible to predict what
position a plaintiff would have been in had the contract been performed, as was
the position in
<i>McRae's case</i>, nonetheless recovery of the expenditure
reasonably incurred in reliance on the defendant's promise is allowed on a
presumption or
assumption made in the plaintiff's favour that he would at least
have recovered his expenditure had the contract been fully performed.
 The
defendant may establish, notwithstanding the impossibility, that the
plaintiff's expenditure would not have been recouped, in
which case the
recovery is denied.  The damages are still limited by the <i>Robinson v
Harman</i> principle, although the application of the principle is affected by
the reversal of the onus of proof involved in the presumption
or assumption
made in favour of the plaintiff.  
<P>

1359	This analysis appears from the judgments of Mason CJ and Dawson J at
80-89, Brennan J at 104-108, Deane J at 126-128, Toohey
J at 134-143 (differing
in the description of the onus of proof), and Gaudron J at 154-157 (also
differing in the description of
the onus of proof as a practical or evidentiary
onus);  cf McHugh J at 164-167.  The particular references to <i>McRae's
case</i> include (the parts in the passages in square brackets are footnotes in

<P>

"Accordingly, <i>McRae </i>illustrates the proposition that a plaintiff has a
prima facie case for recovery of wasted expenditure once it is established that
the expense was incurred in reliance on the promise of the party in breach,
there being a failure of performance by that party. 
By reason of its facts,
the reasoning in <i>McRae</i> does not depend upon the presumption that an
innocent party would not have entered into the contract unless it would at
least have
recovered its reliance expenditure under the contract had it been
performed.  But the reasoning is not inconsistent with the application,
in
appropriate cases, of that presumption which, in our view, has much to commend
it.  Indeed, it is just and fair that the repudiating
party should bear the
onus of showing that the party not in breach would have made a loss on the
contract."  (per Mason CJ and Dawson
J at 89).
<P>

"In a case where a plaintiff has incurred expenditure either in procuring the
contract or in its performance but it is impossible
or difficult to establish
the value of any benefits which the plaintiff would have derived from
performance by the defendant, considerations
of justice dictate that the
plaintiff may rely on a presumption that the value of those benefits would have
been at least equal to
the total detriment which has been or would have been
sustained by the plaintiff in doing whatever was reasonably necessary to
procure
and perform the contract [See, eg <i>McRae</i> (1951) 84 CLR at 414;
<i>Holt v United Security Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co (1909) 72 Atlantic
Reporter</i> 301 at pp 305-306;  <i>L Albert &amp; Son v Armstrong Rubber
Co</i> (1949) 178 F. 2d 182 at pp 188-189].  In my view, the rational basis of
that presumption is that that total detriment represents
what would reasonably
have been in the contemplation of the parties themselves as the cost to the
plaintiff of full performance by
the defendant and constitutes some evidence,
in proceedings between them, of the value of the total benefits which would
have been
derived by the plaintiff from such performance.  It follows from
that, at least in a case where proof of value is impossible or difficult,
it is
presumed in the plaintiff's favour that the future net benefits (ie excess of
future benefit over future detriment) which would
have been derived from
performance of the contract would have been of a value sufficient to recoup the
past net expenditure reasonably
incurred in procuring or performing it.  Where
that presumption is operative, it enables the recovery by a plaintiff of what
are
commonly referred to as `reliance damages', that is to say, damages
equivalent to the wasted expenditure which has been reasonably
incurred in
reliance upon the assumption that the contractual promises of the defendant
would be honoured.  The presumption will
be rebutted if it be self-evident or
established that the plaintiff would have derived no financial or other benefit
from performance
of the contract or that any financial or other benefit which
would have been derived from future performance would not have been
sufficient
in value to counter balance the past expenditure.  The presumption will not,
however, be displaced merely by the circumstance
that the benefit which the
plaintiff would have obtained from performance by the defendant included the
chance of some more remote
benefits which the plaintiff would have obtained
from performance by the defendant included the chance of some more remote
benefit
and it is a matter of speculation whether that ultimate benefit would
have in fact been obtained or by the circumstance that the
perceived `benefit'
which the plaintiff sought and for which he incurred the past expenditure is
something which is of value only
to the plaintiff or which, for some other
reason, is not capable of being objectively valued in monetary terms [See eg
<i>McRae </i>(1951) 84 CLR at p 414;  <i>Fink v Fink</i> (1946) 74 CLR at pp
134-135, 143]."  (per Deane J at 126-127).
<P>

"Once it is appreciated that damages assessed by reference to wasted
expenditure are awarded to compensate for the loss of contractual
rights or for
loss of profits, it is apparent that what is involved is an assumption
[Referred to in <i>McRae</i> (1951) 84 CLR at p 414, as `a starting-point']
that the loss is no less than that which has been outlaid and wasted by reason
of
repudiation or breach.  An assumption to that effect is no more than the
recognition of the ordinary expectations of the world of
commerce that the
value of a contract will be no less than the cost of its performance."  (Per
Gaudron J at 155-156).
<P>

1360<i>	McRae's case</i>, therefore, illustrates the recovery of wasted
expenditure as damages for breach of contract where the expenditure was
reasonably
incurred in reliance on the promise of the party in breach.  The
expenditure is recovered as compensatory damages within the <i>Robinson v
Harman</i> principle, to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been
in had the contract been performed.  Recovery of the expenditure
is presumed or
assumed where the defendant's breach makes it impossible to show what the
plaintiff's position would have been had
the contract been performed, subject
to the defendant being able to establish that it would not have been recovered.
The NRMA's submission
by way of assertion passed all this by.
<P>

1361	The reasoning in <i>McRae's case</i>, as explained in <i>Commonwealth of
Australia v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd</i>, does not sit well with the NRMA's claim
to recover the wasted expenditure.  To begin with, only the claims against the
solicitors
are claims for breach of contract.  Confining attention to those
claims, it is necessary that the expenditure claimed as wasted expenditure
was
incurred in reliance on a promise by the solicitors.  The relevant promise was
a promise to exercise due care, skill and diligence
in the tasks required of
the solicitors, not a promise to ensure that the NRMA was given the opportunity
lawfully to put the demutualisation
proposal to its members.  Both promises are
different from the promise in <i>McRae's case</i>.  This case is really not a
case of recoupment of expenditure from performance of the contract at all, so
the presumption or assumption
at the heart of the reasoning in <i>McRae's case
</i>can not readily be made.  
<P>

1362	But to the extent to which the reasoning is applicable, it does not render
irrelevant what would have happened if the solicitors
had given the advice in
relation to free shares and disadvantages which the NRMA says should have been
given.  While affected by
the presumption or assumption, in accordance with the
<i>Robinson v Harman</i> principle the damages are to place the NRMA in the
position it would have been in had the contract been performed, and so it is
relevant
to consider what that position would have been.
<P>

1363	Claims for breach of contract have brought recovery of wasted expenditure
in other cases not involving recoupment of expenditure
from performance of the
contract, cases where it is "not sensible to speak of loss of profits".  These
words are taken from the judgment
of Mason CJ and Dawson J in <i>Commonwealth
of Australia v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd</i> at 81-2 (the citations in square
brackets are footnotes in the judgment) -
<P>

"A further example of the application of <i>Robinson v Harman</i> [(1848) <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1848/135.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1848] EngR 135</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Exch%20850" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Ex
850</a> at 855; <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1848/135.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1848] EngR 135</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=154%20ER%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">154 ER 363</a> at 365] which will result in a plaintiff being entitled
to claim damages for wasted expenditure is in a contract for services such
as
that between a solicitor and a client.  Where a solicitor has breached his or
her contractual duty of care, the measure of damages
to which a client will be
entitled will be such an amount as would put the client in the position he or
she would have been in had
the contract of retainer been performed without
negligence.  In cases where, had non-negligent advice been given, the client
would
<i>not </i>have entered into a subsequent transaction, for example a
purchase of real property, then, in conformity with <i>Robinson v Harman</i>,
the client will be entitled to recover as damages expenditure wasted on account
of the negligent advice, less anything subsequently
recovered and given
reasonable acts of mitigation [<i>Hayes v Dodd</i> (1990) 2 All ER 815 at 820,
per Staughton LJ].  The amount of wasted expenditure will be the appropriate
measure of damages in such
a situation because, it having been established that
the client would not have entered into the subsequent contract if proper advice
had been given, it is not sensible to speak of loss of profits.  <i>Hayes v
Dodd</i> is a useful illustration of the statement that the expressions
`expectation damages', `damages for loss of profits', `reliance damages'
and
`damages for wasted expenditure' are simply manifestations of the central
principle enunciated in <i>Robinson v Harman</i> rather than discrete and truly
alternative measures of damages which a party not in breach may elect to
claim."
<P>

1364	But in those cases also the recovery of the wasted expenditure is
compensatory, intended to put the plaintiff in the position
he would have been
in had the contract been performed.  As appears from the reference to <i>Hayes
v Dodd</i> (1990) 2 All ER 815, the clients would not have purchased the
property but for the solicitor's negligent advice.  Damages were awarded
on the
basis of comparing the clients' actual situation with their situation if they
had not entered into the transaction, and the
damages included the loss on
resale of the property and holding expenses.  This is unexceptional, and the
description of wasted expenditure
should not mislead - the damages were for the
loss to the clients of money they would not have spent if the solicitors had
given
proper advice.
<P>

1365	A number of other cases were cited as illustrations of recovery of wasted
expenditure.
<P>

1366	In <i>Anglia Television Ltd v Reed</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%201%20QB%2060" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 1 QB 60</a> an actor repudiated
a contract to appear in a film.  The profits if the film had been made could
not be established, and the maker
of the film claimed its wasted expenditure.
It was held that it could do so, including expenditure before the contract was
made,
provided the expenditure was such as would reasonably be in the
contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if the contract
was
broken.
<P>

1367	In <i>Transportation Agency Ltd v Jenkins</i> (1972) 223 EG 1101 the
client recovered damages from his solicitors when he took a lease of a property
which, because of restrictive
clauses, he could not use for his business.  The
damages included expenditure on the taking of the lease plus rent, it seems by
consent
part of "a balance of what the plaintiffs had in fact lost and gained"
(at 1102).  
<P>

1368	In <i>Heywood v Wellers</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] EWCA Civ 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%201%20QB%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 1 QB 446</a> the client recovered from her
solicitors the costs paid to the solicitors for obtaining an injunction which
was of no use to her,
but at least in the view of Lord Denning MR as money paid
on a consideration which had wholly failed (see at 458).  
<P>

1369	In <i>Clarke v Milford</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2038%20DLR%20%284th%29%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 38 DLR (4th) 139</a> the client recovered
from his solicitors the money paid for a property to which, through the
solicitor's negligence, he got no title,
plus municipal taxes paid in respect
of the property.  This was a similar case to <i>Hayes v Dodd</i>.  
<P>

1370	A case on which the NRMA placed considerable reliance was <i>Waribay Pty
Ltd v Minter Ellison</i> (Brooking J, 7 March 1989, unreported).  The client's
damages for its solicitors' negligence in relation to a share transaction
included
the costs charged by the solicitors.  But the judgment records that
recovery of the costs was conceded, and I do not think the NRMA
gains any
assistance from this case.  The concession was noted when the case went on
appeal <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1991/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] VicRp 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%202%20VR%20391" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 2 VR 391.</a>
<P>

1371	Some cases were also cited as illustrations of non-recovery of wasted
expenditure.  
<P>

1372	In <i>C &amp; P Haulage v Middleton</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] EWCA Civ 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20WLR%201461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1 WLR 1461</a> a car repairer
who had been wrongly ejected from rented premises claimed recovery of
expenditure incurred to make the premises suitable
for occupation.  Ackner LJ
said that this would do more than put him in the position he would have been in
if the contract had been
performed, and would put him in the position he would
have been in if the contract had never been made.  Fox LJ took a rather
different
approach saying that the expenditure was wasted not because of the
breach of contract but because the rental agreement permitted
termination on
short notice, and that the waste resulted from a bad bargain:  with respect,
this is not entirely clear.  
<P>

1373	In <i>GP &amp; P Ltd v Bulcraig Davis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%202%20EGLR%20148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 2 EGLR 148</a> the client
failed to recover from its solicitors for some expenditure prior to the
solicitors' breach of their retainer.  The nature
of the expenditure is
unclear.  The client relied on <i>Anglia Television Ltd v Reed, </i>but that
case was distinguished (at 153) -
<P>

"Unlike the case of <i>Reed</i>, the waste here was not caused by the failure
to discover the planning condition on conveyancing, nor was the project
abandoned because
of it.  The expenditure would have been wasted and the
project abandoned if Mr Wade had performed his duty.  It was abortive
expenditure
in any event ... .  It is not right to say that Mr Wade must
notionally have contemplated that if he failed in his duty, this expenditure
would go to waste."
<P>

On appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20EGLR%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 1 EGLR 138</a> this was not in question.  
<P>

1374	The defendants cited <i>St George Commercial Credit Corporation Ltd v
Collins Wallis Properties Pty Ltd</i> (Rolfe J, 21 August 1998, unreported), to
show that it is necessary to look beyond the fact of a solicitor's negligence
and see what
loss was caused by the negligence.  The lender's solicitor
negligently failed to advise that certain guarantees were unenforceable.
 If he
had so advised, the matter making them unenforceable would have been rectified
and the transaction would have gone ahead.
 To the knowledge of the lender, the
guarantors were financially worthless, and if the guarantees had been
enforceable the lender
would not have obtained anything under them.  It was
held that the solicitor's negligence did not cause the lender's loss.  The
cause
of the loss was the lender's preparedness to take financially worthless
guarantees.
<P>

1375	I do not think that regard to these cases detracts from the need to arrive
at the NRMA's recovery in accordance with the <i>Robinson v Harman</i>
principle.  Describing expenditure as wasted expenditure does not of itself
open the door to recovery.  Still confining attention
to claims for breach of
contract against the solicitors, and on the assumption of negligence, if the
contract had been performed
the solicitors would have given the advice in
relation to free shares and disadvantages which the NRMA said should have been
given.
 The NRMA would have gone ahead with the proposal, but with a suitably
altered prospectus free from the deficiencies in relation
to free shares and
disadvantages.  The expenditure would still have been incurred, and was not
wasted expenditure in the sense of
expenditure which would not have been
incurred.  Asking what money is necessary to put the NRMA in the position it
would have been
in if the solicitors had given the advice in relation to free
shares and disadvantages which the NRMA said should have been given,
the answer
is not the whole range of expenditure claimed globally by the NRMA as the
wasted expenditure.  And if the proper conclusion
is that the proposal have
failed if the NRMA had gone ahead with a suitably altered prospectus, because
unacceptable to the members
in general meetings or for some other reason, the
wasted expenditure is, not the measure of the NRMA's damages.
<P>

1376	Any liability of the solicitors would be in tort as well as in contract,
and the case as ultimately maintained against Mr Heydon
was one of liability
only in tort.  The purpose of damages in tort is to place the plaintiff in the
position he would have been in
but for the wrongful conduct, and normally that
would require the plaintiff to establish in money terms the position he would
have
been in but for the wrongful conduct and his position in fact, the
difference being his damages (see for example the discussions
in <i>Gates v
City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd</i> (1986) 160 CLR 1 and <i>Marks v GIO
Australia Holdings Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2073%20ALJR%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 73 ALJR 12).</a>  From this came the defendants'
submission that the NRMA had to establish in money terms the difference between
its position demutualised
and its position under its mutual structure, or at
the least the difference between its position if a prospectus free from the
deficiencies
as to free shares and disadvantages had been distributed and its
position when enjoined from distribution of the prospectus as approved
on 18
August 1994.  
<P>

1377	The former would not be an easy exercise, but in any event was not
attempted by the NRMA.  Nor indeed did the NRMA attempt
the latter.  But the
position the NRMA would have been in but for the wrongful conduct postulates
the giving of the advice in relation
to free shares and disadvantages which the
NRMA said should have been given.  Asking as before what money is necessary to
put the
NRMA in the position it would have been in if the solicitors or Mr
Heydon had given that advice, the answer is not the whole range
of expenditure
claimed globally by the NRMA as wasted expenditure, and the wasted expenditure
is not the measure of the NRMA's damages.
<P>

1378	In this respect, in this case the working out of the damages for breach of
contract and the damages in tort come together.
 Recovery of wasted expenditure
as damages in a claim in tort must still be consistent with the central
principle of the assessment
of damages in tort, as recovery of wasted
expenditure as damages for breach of contract must be consistent with the
<i>Robinson v Harman</i> principle.  Where it is not sensible to speak of loss
of profits, it may be that the expenditure is recoverable if it would not have
been incurred, if the proper advice had been given.  If the expenditure would
still have been incurred it is relevant to ask whether
the expenditure would
have been wasted, that is, in this case whether the proposal would not have
been approved by the members in
general meetings or would otherwise not have
proceeded.  Even an affirmative answer to this last question does not mean that
the
wasted expenditure is the measure of the NRMA's damages, but it is a
necessary question.
<P>

1379	In my opinion, therefore, the second step in the NRMA's argument should
not be accepted.  The difficulty then is that, adhering
to its argument, the
NRMA did not present a case of putting the proposal to the members, or of
endorsement of the proposal by a sufficient
majority of members in general
meetings.  Subject to the shift from a global claim of loss earlier mentioned,
it maintained the global
claim to the entire wasted expenditure, and squarely
stood or fell according to the acceptance of its argument based on <i>McRae's
case</i>,<i> </i>and maintained that investigation beyond 18 August 1994 was
not relevant.  
<P>

1380	So in the transcript of the oral submissions - 
<P>

"HIS HONOUR:  Does it follow from the way you are putting the matter, Mr Sher,
that you could in principle concede that the demutualisation
proposal would
have been rejected by the members if the meeting had been held, but say that
doesn't affect the claim you now make?
<P>

MR SHER:  Yes, that's absolutely right, your Honour.  There are two reasons for
that.  The first is we don't allege that the task
of the defendants, any of
them, was to effect the demutualisation;  that is something they couldn't have
done.  Only the members
could have effected the demutualisation.  What the
defendants could do, and what we say they were all engaged to do, was to
facilitate
legally the plaintiff's attempt to demutualise in a lawful
manner.
<P>

The second reason that we say that it doesn't matter is because whatever the
cases say as to whether you're forced to elect or not,
they certainly make
clear that you can sue for wasted expenditure and, if you sue for wasted
expenditure, considerations in relation
to loss of opportunity or loss of a
chance are irrelevant.
<P>

A claim that the meeting may or may not have voted in favour of the
demutualisation is relevant to the issue of loss of a chance
or loss of
opportunity."
<P>

1381	The NRMA did concede that if the demutualisation "was doomed to failure
from day one because there was never a chance that
the members would agree to
it", then "one of our difficulties might be that we couldn't show that the
cause of the loss was in fact
the inability to hold a lawful meeting".  In my
view the (partial) concession was correctly made, and pointed up the difficulty
in
principle in the NRMA's case for recovery of the whole of the wasted
expenditure.
<P>

1382	In these circumstances it might be sufficient to say that, where I have
not accepted the second step in the NRMA's argument,
the claim in relation to
free shares and disadvantages must fail because, in the manner it put its case,
the NRMA has not established
that the wasted expenditure was its loss in
consequence of the alleged negligence of the defendants.  The defendants,
however, specifically
raised causation defences.  Again causation was for the
NRMA to prove, but I should say more of those defences.
<P>

<b>Defences</b>
<P>

1383	In my opinion the causation defences specifically raised are good
defences, in the sense that on the facts disclosed in the
evidence I consider
that, even if the defendants had given the advice in relation to free shares
and disadvantages which the NRMA
says should have been given, the proposal
would not have been approved by the members in general meetings.  There are a
number of
steps in the reasoning to that conclusion.
<P>

1384	As has been seen in the description of the proceedings before
Gummow J, his Honour found that distribution of the prospectus
and onsert
was engaging in misleading conduct in five respects.  Only one of the respects,
that to do with free shares identified
as (d) in these reasons, was upheld by
the Full Court.  In my opinion it is plain that, had there not been the
deficiency of which
the NRMA complains in these proceedings in relation to free
shares and disadvantages, his Honour would have restrained further distribution
of the prospectus and onsert, and proceeding with the meetings, because of the
misleading conduct found by him in the other respects.
 The NRMA submitted
before me that free shares was the overwhelming deficiency, and that in its
absence the injunctions would not
have been granted.  I do not agree.  I should
add for completeness, although I do not think it was in issue, that given the
profound
opposition to the proposal evinced by Mr Talbot and the advice he had
received from Mr Garnsey and Mr Camilleri, I also consider
it plain that, even
in the absence of the deficiency of which the NRMA complains in these
proceedings, Mr Talbot and Miss Fraser
would have brought the Federal Court
proceedings.  
<P>

1385	The case of <i>Barnes v Hay</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 337</a> which the NRMA said
precluded the defendants from relying in this way on the prosecution of the
Federal Court proceedings by Mr Talbot,
does not do so.  There the solicitor's
negligence left the client without protection from the broad equivalent to the
spoiling tactics.
 Here the four other respects in which Gummow J found
misleading conduct were available to Mr Talbot apart from any negligence by
the
defendants, Mr Talbot would have taken them up, and even if negligence by the
defendants be assumed it did not expose the NRMA
to the claims leading to those
findings.
<P>

1386	So the NRMA would have had to consider appealing to the Full Court.  Still
postulating a prospectus without the deficiencies
of which the NRMA complains
in these proceedings, in my opinion the NRMA would have resolved to appeal.
The first respect in which
Gummow J found misleading conduct was of general
importance to it, and was significant in the decision the NRMA in fact took.  A
majority was anxious that the proposal should proceed.  The decision would have
been the same.  
<P>

1387	The general meetings would therefore have been adjourned into 1995 even if
the lawyers had given the advice which the NRMA
says should have been given and
the prospectus had been suitably altered.  That would have happened for reasons
unconnected with
the negligence on the part of the defendants alleged in these
proceedings.  It would have happened because the proposal by its nature
and in
the circumstances then obtaining met the opposition of Mr Talbot, and the
prospect always present that opponents of the proposal
would seek to prevent
its implementation by alleging that members were being misled would have been
realised.  So-called spoiling
tactics had always been foreseen, and this sort
of event had been particularly forecast by, for example, Mr Bateman on 3
December
1993.
<P>

1388	If the Full Court had upheld the appeal and dissolved the injunctions,
because the deficiencies in relation to free shares/disadvantages
were not
present and the other respects in which Gummow J had found misleading conduct
were overturned, the NRMA would have been
able to proceed with the general
meetings.  (It may be that Mr Talbot would have brought forward the remaining
elements of his proceedings,
or brought other proceedings, to prevent the NRMA
from proceeding with the general meetings.  As can be seen from the facts, his
resolve was strong and he was active in his opposition.  I will assume that
nothing of this kind would have occurred.)  The NRMA
would then have been able
to put the proposal before the general meetings, albeit (a) after some delay;
and (b) without the advantage,
as it was perceived, of describing the shares as
free shares in the manner of the original prospectus (although there may still
have
been some kind of notion of free shares).
<P>

1389	But by one or other of alternative last steps, in the result the proposal
would not have been approved by the members in general
meetings, or it has not
been established that it would have been so approved.
<P>

1390	One of the alternative last steps is itself a little complex, involving
the financial position of the NRMA as disclosed to
the adjourned general
meetings.  In brief, demutualisation would by then have lost the earlier
financial attraction, and would not
have attracted sufficient support from the
members.  The make-up of this last step is as follows.  
<P>

1391	As earlier described, the prospectus included financial information, part
of which was a forecast consolidated after-tax profit
for the NRMA Group for
1994/95 of $215 million involving an underwriting loss of $129 million and
unrealised investment gains of
$102 million.  The C&amp;L report, while making
it clear that actual results might vary materially from the forecasts, said
that
movements from 30 June 1994 to the date of the report had "not been
significant in terms of their effect on the results".  The prospectus
had a
limited life, and even during its currency a "significant change" affecting a
matter within it had to be the subject of a supplementary
prospectus
(s 1024 of the Law, coming into force on 1 September 1994).  The need to
inform members of any significant movements could
only have been underlined by
the C&amp;L report.
<P>

1392	The evidence of Mr Worthington and Mr Chalmers enabled the conclusions (i)
that by early 1995 an evaluation of the NRMA's investment
portfolio would have
indicated that the unrealised investment gains would not exceed $70 million,
and that the NRMA would have been
so aware;  (ii)  that by the same time a
deterioration in the CTP results was evident;  and (iii) that these represented
a material
change in the forecast profit of $215 million.  To this evidence may
be added a note to the 1993/94 financial statements that the
value of equity
investments held by the Insurance Group had fallen by $84.8 million from 30
June to 30 November 1994, a letter from
Mr Pearce dated 21 February 1995 to the
board of Insurance forecasting a loss of $99.4 million in lieu of a forecast
profit of $197
million for the purposes of the prospectus (these were for
Insurance, so not directly found in the prospectus). 
<P>

1393	At least some of the directors were aware of an averse change in the
NRMA's financial position.  In January 1995 Mr Mackay
learnt of the CTP
deterioration, which he agreed "made the forecast in the prospectus look fairly
sick".  Mr Corrigan knew, probably
in December 1994, that the trend in relation
to CTP was "not looking good".  Mr Jack knew by the end of 1994 that there were
significant
unrealised losses and that the forecasts in the prospectus so far
as they concerned CTP "had started to look sick".
<P>

1394	Mr Mackay agreed that a revised forecast in a supplementary prospectus
would have been required.  Mr Corrigan's evidence was
to the same effect, and
Mr Jack in retrospect saw that the forecasts might have needed revision.  Mr
Ross of BT thought that what
was in Mr Pearce's letter was sufficiently
material to require the issue of a supplementary prospectus.  These were,
perhaps, incomplete
and insufficiently comprehensive reactions in
cross-examination.  But the conclusions available from the evidence of Mr
Worthington
and Mr Chalmers should in my opinion be reached.  Based on those
conclusions, it should further be concluded that there was a significant
change
affecting the profit forecast, known to the NRMA no later than the end of
January 1995 and probably early in January 1995,
calling for the issue of a
supplementary prospectus in which the profit forecast was significantly less
than the $215 million.  The
further conclusion can be reached with more comfort
in the light of the reactions of Mr Mackay, Mr Corrigan, Mr Jack, and Mr Ross.

<P>

1395	I leave out of account evidence from Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman to the
effect that Ms Conway said that the management accounts
showed a major
deterioration in profit (early December 1994, Mr Morgan) and that the profit
forecast of $215 million was likely to
be a loss of $100 million although the
position was unclear (1 February 1995, Mr Bateman).  There was some contention
and obscurity
over the first of these, and the second was qualified and the
sub-figures told to Mr Bateman ($200 million unrealised losses, $100
million
drop in CTP) were remarkably large and not otherwise supported.  But this
evidence would only confirm the further conclusion.
<P>

1396	The members would have attended the adjourned general meetings, or given
their proxies, after receipt of a supplementary prospectus
disclosing a
significant change in the forecast consolidated net profit for the then current
year.  Apart from the supplementary
prospectus, those who read the financial
press would have seen articles at the end of January and early in February 1995
in which
Mr Mackay was reported as saying that the falling share market had
caused a fall of $200 million in the value of the NRMA and that
"the original
$2 billion tag placed on the float would not be reached under current market
conditions.  They would have seen articles
in which a "sharp revision" to the
prospectus forecast was to be made, articles in which unnamed "observers"
referred to $300 million
lost capitalisation, and articles in which NRMA
executives otherwise acknowledged a less attractive financial state.  Unnamed
"analysts"
said that the NRMA would have to decide "whether to press ahead with
the float as soon as possible or delay for several months in
the hope that the
sharemarket improved and generated a greater listing price".  The proposal
would have been  seen as financially
less attractive, and the shares would have
been worth less, than presented in the original prospectus, although I do not
think the
evidence permitted a reliable finding as to the figures.  
<P>

1397	Most of the members would also have been aware of the discussion
underlying and litigation in the Federal Court proceedings,
litigation in which
(on the hypothetical basis now under consideration) the NRMA had been found at
first instance to have engaged
in misleading conduct but had been absolved on
appeal.  And (on the same hypothetical basis) the members would not have been
enticed
by the references to free shares seen by the marketing advisers as
important to a favourable outcome of the meetings, or at least
not in the
manner of the original prospectus.  Would the proposal have gained the
necessary 75 per cent approvals?
<P>

1398	At least in part because, true to its argument, the NRMA did not enter
upon the area, this is close to the realm of speculation.
 The defendants did
enter upon the area, but an attempt to answer the question must draw on more or
less obscure indicators.  
<P>

1399	The market research carried out by Woolcott for the NRMA in late 1993
showed resistance to the "corporatisation" of the NRMA.
 A report of 2 February
1994 stated that "initially 43% would have voted against the proposed change,
31% were in favour and 26%
were undecided".  When reference was made to the
share allocation, however, the percentages were 36 percent, 42 per cent, and 22
per cent - the share distribution motivated approval.  Hence what Woolcott
called communication objectives "to inform members of
the proposed changes and
encourage them to vote in favour", with the added comment, "This includes
communication of the proposed
distribution of the current wealth of the NRMA
via member and policyholder entitlements, ie share allocation".  
<P>

1400	By mid-April 1994 further research showed that 50 per cent of members were
not aware of the proposal, and that of the 50 per
cent who were aware of it
over half (27 per cent of the whole) were undecided and some (6 per cent of the
whole) would vote against.
 Mr Salvage described these results as "encouraging
at such an early stage", but said that "much remains to be done to overcome the
notoriously high levels of member inertia (in spite of high levels of professed
intent to act) on governance issues".  He said that
all press and television
advertising would "aim to focus on the four key issues which research has
identified as critical", namely
change for the better, shares at no cost, value
from $500 to $2,000, and voting is vital.  
<P>

1401	Further research by Woolcott in August and September 1994 included
tracking the percentage of respondents who were in favour
of the proposal
because "provide benefits/advantage for those involved/free shares".  The
percentage increased quite markedly, and
confirmed the views of Mr Barrett and
Mr Fitch that the use of "free shares" was an important part of the NRMA's
publicity.
<P>

1402	A communications meeting on 2 September 1994 was told that there had been
"no dramatic movement in the results of the research.
 Awareness and voting
intentions have increased slightly".  The base from which this spoke was not
entirely clear.  A telephone survey
of NRMA members conducted at the end of
September 1994, it seems not on behalf of the NRMA, showed considerable
awareness of the
proposal (92 per cent) and intention to vote (82 per cent),
and that of those intending to vote "almost half (44 per cent) indicated
that
they will definitely support the float and a further 19 per cent will probably
support it, making a nett support level of 63
per cent".  The net opposition
figure was 18 per cent, and the surveyor commented that it appeared that the
last-minute decision
of those members still undecided would "have a big
influence on the outcome of the proposal".
<P>

1403	The proxies received for the meetings of 19 October 1994 reflected
approvals in excess of the necessary 75 per cent, but not
greatly in excess

<P>

These approvals would be vulnerable to an adverse impression from the
litigation or, more particularly, the reduced forecast net
profit.
<P>

1404	As at the beginning of May 1995 market research indicated that the
approvals had fallen to approximately 50 per cent and the
disapprovals had
increased to approximately 25 per cent.  These results were, no doubt, affected
by the NRMA's defeat in the Federal
Court proceedings, which must have created
an adverse perception in some members.  But the vulnerability to adverse
impression is
underlined, and Mr Worland, then the NRMA's assistant general
manager, public affairs, considered that it would not be possible to
achieve
the 75 per cent approvals in the foreseeable future.  
<P>

1405	Taking all these maters going to the last step to which I have referred,
and to the extent to which a finding can reliably
be made on the scanty
material available, on the probabilities I consider that the proposal would not
have gained the necessary 75
per cent approvals at the adjourned general
meetings.  I am not sure that a finding can reliably be made, and would prefer
to say
that I do not think it has been established that the proposal would have
gained the necessary approvals at the adjourned general
meetings.
<P>

1406	The other alternative last step may be stated more shortly.  It looks to
the effect of the decision of the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.
<P>

1407	With a decision of the Full Court at about the end of January 1995, and
the need for the reasons just given for a supplementary
prospectus, on the
probabilities the adjourned general meetings would not have been reconvened
until after the decision of the High
Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i> had been
handed down on 8 March 1995.  Even if the NRMA had not received the submissions
of CU, ME and NS, and was not receiving
advice from Professor Austin, the
reception given to the decision amongst corporate lawyers would have led to the
same recognition
as in fact occurred that the proposal could not be implemented
by the resolutions in general meetings route.  The proposal would
not have been
approved by the members in general meetings, because it would not have been put
before the general meetings.
<P>

1408	The NRMA sought to counter this by submissions at some length.  It
described the steps as an argument that the decision of
the High Court in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> was a supervening event, breaking the chain of
causation.  It said that the free shares/disadvantages negligence was "still
operating",
because but for that negligence the NRMA would not have been
exposed to the effect of <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  It was also said that the
decision of the High Court was "the final event which causes the whole of the
damage".  The reasoning
was not made clear, but seemed to be that expressed in
the submissions that "the original negligence was itself foreseeably likely
to
cause significant delay" and that the continuing effect of the free
shares/disadvantages negligence "was the delay that negligence
caused and the
exposure of [the NRMA] to the risk that the Gambotto decision actually ...
was."
<P>

1409	In my view this misses the point.  Whether or not it be accepted that
delay exposing the NRMA to the effect of Gambotto's case
was reasonably
foreseeable (which may require that Gambotto negligence be taken together with
free shares/disadvantages negligence),
the point is that the delay would have
occurred even if there had not been the free shares/disadvantages negligence.
The decision
in <i>Gambotto's case</i> was a supervening decision, but that is
not the same as being a supervening event in an argument about causation.  The
NRMA was always
exposed to the effect of <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and would have
suffered that effect even if there had not been free shares/disadvantages
negligence.
<P>

1410	The NRMA's submission that <i>Gambotto's case</i> as decided by the High
Court would not have prevented the demutualisation from proceeding, a
submission which I earlier described
as made in order to repel a causation
argument, seemed to be directed to this step in the defendants' causation
defences.  The submission,
however, did not meet the argument.  What matters is
not whether, on a correct appreciation of the decision, the demutualisation
could have proceeded by the resolutions in general meetings route despite
<i>Gambotto's case</i>, but that the NRMA was advised that it could not so
proceed in the face of <i>Gambotto's case</i>, and acted on that advice.  It is
not necessary to express a view on whether the advice the NRMA received from Mr
Emmett, Professor
Austin, Mr Heydon and Mr Hulme was correct.  There is no
reason to think that the same advice would not have been given, and acted
on,
in the circumstances now under consideration.
<P>

1411	The causation defences should therefore be approached with the finding
that, had the defendants given the advice in relation
to free
shares/disadvantages which the NRMA says should have been given, the proposal
would still not have gone to the members in
general meetings or, if it went to
the members in general meetings, would not have gained the necessary 75 per
cent approvals;  as
the preferred finding, it has not been established that it
would have gained the necessary 75 per cent approvals.  The expenditure
would
have been wasted anyway, in the sense that demutualisation by the resolutions
in general meetings route would have failed.
 (For present purposes Gambotto
negligence must be put aside, and the fact of the resolutions in general
meetings route must be accepted).
<P>

1412	That is the finding of fact, but does it mean that the free
shares/disadvantages negligence alleged against the defendants
would not in law
have caused the waste of the expenditure?  Causation in the law is notoriously
difficult, and the submissions on
causation in these proceedings were
extensive.  I intend no disrespect in explaining quite briefly why I consider
the answer is yes.
 
<P>

1413	It is well established that the existence of a causal connection between a
plaintiff's claimed loss and the defendant's negligence
is to be determined
according to common sense ideas, and not according to philosophical or
scientific theories of causation  (<i>March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506</a>;  <i>Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176
CLR 408</a>;  <i>Chappel v Hart</i>).  Causation in the law is concerned with
ascertaining or apportioning legal responsibility for an act or omission, and
so involves
value judgments and "the infusion of policy considerations"
((<i>March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd </i>at 516).  Although there may be a
causal connection where the act or omission only contributes to the loss, that
is, is one of a number
of conditions sufficient to produce the loss, the "but
for" test is not the sole determinant of causation, and so the plaintiff will
not necessarily succeed merely because he would not have suffered the loss but
for the defendant's act or omission.  Conversely,
as <i>Chappel v Hart
</i>shows, the defendant's act or omission may be held to have caused the
plaintiff's loss where the plaintiff might have suffered the
loss anyway.  In
that case the possibility that the loss would have been suffered anyway was
regarded by the majority as insufficient
reason to displace the connection
between the defendant's omission and the injury in fact suffered by the
plaintiff.  Even then,
in <i>Chappel v Hart</i> it would have been open to the
defendant to have the plaintiff's damages reduced to reflect the possibility
that, independently of
his omission, the plaintiff would have sustained her
injury at a later time.
<P>

1414	In the present case, at all times, there was the prospect that the
demutualisation would not gain the necessary 75 per cent
approvals, either
because of successful spoiling tactics or because the members were not
persuaded on the merits to vote in favour
of the proposal.  The prospect was
not a random possibility like that to which the plaintiff in <i>Chappel v Hart
</i>was exposed, and was a prospect which at all times would have been
recognised as leading to waste of the NRMA's expenditure, if it
came about, in
that the expenditure would have been incurred but the demutualisation would
have failed.  On the finding I have made,
the prospect would have been realised
even if there had not been the free shares/disadvantages negligence (and on one
of the alternative
would have been realised quite apart from <i>Gambotto's
case</i>).  The free shares/disadvantages negligence accelerated the same
outcome, failure of the demutualisation by the resolutions in general
meetings
route.  On the common sense approach to which I have referred, I do not think
the waste of the expenditure should be regarded
as having been caused by the
free shares/disadvantages negligence alleged.  Although for different reasons,
as in <i>St George Commercial Credit Corporation Ltd v Collins Wallis
Properties Pty Ltd</i> the negligence would not have caused the client the
claimed loss.  
<P>

1415	It remains to refer to the NRMA's shift from a global claim of loss.
<P>

1416	In the course of the NRMA's submissions in chief its position throughout
the hearing was confirmed -
<P>

"HIS HONOUR:  Just before you do that - please do in a moment - I had intended
to ask you whether so far as your submissions were
concerned you really did
treat all the money in the one category;  it was win or lose as to the lot,
with the difference in the case
of the Gambotto case about pre-17 March or
pre-first board meeting after the hearing.
<P>

MR SHER:  It is, but subject to the resolution of those arguments in principle.
There's a series of arguments which we address in
our submissions and we've
given your Honour authority on managerial expenses in the case of <i>Tate</i>.
That is our position."
<P>

The arguments in principle were discrete matters considered later in these
reasons.
<P>

1417	In the course of Mr Heydon's submissions on why the NRMA's stance on
causation was incorrect, it was said that the NRMA could
have sought to
demonstrate what expenditure had been incurred which would not have been
incurred but for the free shares/disadvantages
negligence, for example the
expenditure on retaining the other solicitors in early 1995.  This was not
news.
<P>

1418	Then came the shift in the NRMA's position in its submissions in reply.
In the context of submissions concerning <i>Gambotto's case</i> as a
supervening event, it was said that the NRMA's case in relation to damages
"falls into a number of parts".  One part was that
the decision of Gummow J
meant that the expenditure to that time was wasted.  The other part was
described as "damage which flowed
from the attempt to mitigate and which is
recoverable as a consequence of the original wrongful acts", itself described
as falling
into two parts, namely the expenditure until the decision in
<i>Gambotto's case</i> (getting advice, the costs of the Federal Court
proceedings, and other things after the decision of the Full Court) and then
the
expenditure thereafter (getting advice, and the Grant Samuel report and its
distribution).  
<P>

1419	A little later, in the context of submissions on causation generally, the
expenditure after the decision of Gummow J was described
as "a classic case of
mitigation", and while the label of wasted expenditure was still given to the
damages the now tripartite division
of the damages was asserted - 
<P>

"But in our submission, if one thinks about it, once you assume that we're
seeking wasted expenditure in saying that in effect Justice
Gummow's decision
caused it, even though the second lot of wasted expenditure is still wasted
expenditure, we say it is a consequential
waste of expenditure.  Perhaps we
should have made that clear, but I think yesterday I said there were three lots
really:  there
is the wasted expenditure after the decision in Gambotto when
they got the Grant Samuel report and distributed it to the members.
 So in a
sense we've got three categories of wasted expenditure."
<P>

1420	This was really a different case on damages.  The expenditure after the
decision of Gummow J was not wasted expenditure in
the same sense as the
expenditure prior to that decision, if properly described as wasted expenditure
at all.  Perhaps it could have
been claimed as expenditure reasonably incurred
as a result of the defendants' negligence or statutory wrong, but it had not
been
claimed in that way.  AAH submitted that it was not open to the NRMA to
depart from its global claim of loss, and that it (AAH) would
have done other
than it had in evidence and submissions, had the damages been claimed in a
different way.  The other defendants expressly
or impliedly adopted the same
position.  I agree.  The shift from a global claim of loss should not be
permitted.
<P>

1421	In outlining the defences as filed, I recorded that each of the defendants
had relied on s 1318(1) of the Law in relation not
only to the claims under ss
995(2) and 996(1) of the Law, but also to all the claims against it or him.
The submissions of AAH were
confined to reliance on s 1318(1) in relation to
the claims under ss 995(2) and 996(1) of the Law.  The submissions of AT were
more
general, it seems relying on s 1318(1) in relation to the claim for
negligence:  there was reference to <i>Daniels v Anderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR
438</a> at 524-5, in which availability of s 1318(1) in relation to a claim for
negligence was assumed but not decided.  The submissions
did not otherwise go
into the arguments for and against availability, and as to the substance were
no more than a few lines, referring
to "the novelty of the transaction, the
force of the instructions from the client and the novelty of the law as found
in <i>Fraser </i>(both in its application of TPA <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> to prospectuses and
the manner in which the duty of disclosure was interpreted in the context of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52".</a>  Mr Heydon also referred to <i>Daniels v Anderson</i>, saying that
the evidence demonstrated that he had acted honestly in performing the tasks
which he was retained to perform, comparing
his role to that of the solicitors,
and putting a number of matters alleged to constitute contributory negligence
on the part of
the NRMA.  
<P>

1422	The submissions as to s 1318(1) were not entirely satisfactory.
Fortunately, it is unnecessary to consider the availability
of s 1318(1) in
relation to the claims in contract and for negligence, or whether the
defendants can successfully rely on it.
<P>

1423	I do not think that there was anything in the allegations of failure to
mitigate loss.  As with Gambotto liability, in the
face of the clear advice
received by the NRMA that it could not proceed by the resolutions in general
meetings route, it could not
be said that it should have mitigated its loss by
issuing a supplementary prospectus.  That is so regardless of Gambotto
negligence,
and for reasons earlier given the implementation of the proposal
would have been delayed until a time when the advice would have
had effect
before implementation by to a supplementary prospectus.  What I have said in
dealing with Gambotto liability in connection
with proceeding by the scheme of
arrangement route is equally material to free shares/disadvantages
liability.
<P>

1424	The allegations of contributory negligence in the defences were
particularly directed to free shares/disadvantages liability.
 Again the
decision in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i> makes contributory negligence of no
value to the solicitors, but where I have found that neither they nor Mr Heydon
was negligent
an exercise of identifying any negligence on the part of the NRMA
and assessing respective responsibilities can not readily be undertaken.
 The
exercise would be so hypothetical and accordingly qualified that I consider it
would be more of a hindrance than a help to attempt
it for the assistance of an
appellate court if these proceedings go further, and I do not attempt it.
<P>

<b>Contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></b>
<P>

1425	The statutory provisions have already been set out.  It is necessary that
AAH and AT engaged in misleading conduct, that they
did so in trade or
commerce, and that the NRMA suffered loss or damage by that conduct.  It is not
necessary that AAH and AT were
negligent in the conduct alleged to constitute
the misleading conduct, or that they intended to mislead, and even if they
acted honestly
and reasonably they may nonetheless be held to have contravened
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> and to be liable accordingly (see <i>Parkdale Custombuilt

Thus my opinion that they were not
negligent in relation to free shares and disadvantages does not of itself
provide an
answer to these claims, although as will be seen it is not
irrelevant to them.  
<P>

1426	The NRMA submitted that the solicitors had engaged in misleading conduct
of three separate but interrelated kinds.  First,
it was said that, following
the opinions of Mr Heydon of 2 and 3 August 1994, Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman knew
that it could not be
represented that there was nothing which had come to their
attention which might give rise to an allegation of misleading or deceptive
conduct in, or material omission from, the prospectus, but by their
participation in the activities of the due diligence committee
and their
approval of the report of the due diligence committee, without bringing to the
attention of the committee the free shares
problem raised by Mr Heydon, they
represented to the contrary.  Secondly, it was said that the sign-off letters,
by their failure
to raise or address the issues drawn to the attention of Mr
Morgan and Mr Bateman by Mr Heydon's opinions of 2 and 3 August 1994,
also
conveyed the misleading representation that there was nothing which had come to
their attention which might render the prospectus
misleading or deceptive.
Thirdly, it was said that in remaining silent about Mr Heydon's opinions of 2
and 3 August 1994 when attending
the various committee and board meetings later
in August 1994 Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman conveyed the same misleading
representation.
 
<P>

1427	The misleading conduct on which the NRMA relied in each instance was
conduct by silence.  It was put forward in supplementary
written submissions
intended to restate the NRMA's case in this respect.  The earlier written
submissions, while referring in a less
than satisfactory manner to misleading
conduct by silence, had also put forward misleading conduct by what was
described as express
representations in the sign-off letters and the report of
the due diligence committee "that the demutualisation transaction itself
and
the transaction documents they had drawn up to implement it were lawful and
legally effective", and by verification statements
by Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman
part of the due diligence process "in which they purported to verify the
accuracy of every statement
in the prospectus".  The supplementary submissions
followed my request that the NRMA identify the specific passages in the
sign-off
letters, the report of the due diligence committee, and the
verification statements it said amount to the representations.  
<P>

1428	In the result, the NRMA abandoned a case of express representations, and
by the supplementary submissions enlarged and clarified
its case of misleading
conduct by silence.  The NRMA accepted in submissions that if there could be
"nothing more alleged in connection
with the conduct than the negligence
itself" there would not be misleading conduct, and it seems that the NRMA put
its case in the
way it did in order better to contend that there was misleading
conduct, and that the conduct was in trade and commerce consistently
with the
reasoning in <i>Prestia v Acknar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20165" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 165</a>, see later in these
reasons.
<P>

1429	Silence may constitute misleading conduct as part of all relevant
circumstances constituted by acts, omissions, statements
or silence, for
example if the circumstances are such as to give rise to the reasonable
expectation that if a particular state of
affairs exists it will be disclosed.
Put another way, if the silence gives rise to an inference that the state of
affairs does not
exist, a failure to disclose that it exists may be misleading
conduct.  It is sufficient to refer, amongst the many cases on the
subject, to
<i>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Mehta</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 84</a>;  <i>Demagogue

<P>

1430	Where the circumstances include that the existence of the state of affairs
involves a judgment or an opinion, that it does
so must be taken into account
in determining whether the silence constitutes misleading conducts.  That is so
because in the circumstances
as a whole the silence may itself be an expression
of judgment or opinion by the silent party, to be tested for its misleading
nature
according to whether the judgment or opinion represented an honest
opinion with a rational basis (cf <i>Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror
Newspapers Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1984/180.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] FCA 180</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20FCR%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 FCR 82</a> at 88;  <i>Bateman v Slatyer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2071%20ALR%20553" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 71
ALR 553</a> at 559), and because the other party's expectation or inference may be
affected by his recognition that the silent party is exercising
judgment or
expressing an opinion.  That, however, will only be part of the overall
circumstances.
<P>

1431	As I have earlier noted, the due diligence process included regard to
breach of legislative or other requirements, and the
sign-off letters were
directed to whether the prospectus sufficiently included or commented on
anything which might affect the decision
of a potential investor and,
specifically in the case of the AAH sign-off letter, whether there was a
material false or misleading
statement or material omission in the prospectus.
In a letter from AAH to Mr Rees dated 30 March 1994 it was said that the
members
of the due diligence committee "must be satisfied that the process
identifies material matters and does not omit material issues",
and in a paper
dealing with materiality for the purposes of prospectus disclosure towards the
end of April 1994 AT stated that an
item of information would be judged
material "if its omission, non-disclosure or mis-statement would cause the
prospectus to mislead
users when making evaluations or decisions about
investing in NRMA".  
<P>

1432	Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman had to act accordingly, both in their
participation in the activities of the due diligence committee
and in providing
the sign-off letters, and it may be assumed that their attendance at the
various committee and board meetings in
August 1994 provided alternative
opportunities for them to disclose, if it was necessary that it be disclosed,
the free shares problem
raised by Mr Heydon and their awareness of it as
something which might render the prospectus misleading or deceptive.  
<P>

1433	However, for the reasons given when dealing with negligence in relation to
free shares and disadvantages, I do not think the
implicit judgment exercised
by Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman in that connection was unreasonable.  Whether there
was misleading conduct
involves not a narrow finding that Mr Morgan and Mr
Bateman did not tell the due diligence committee or the boards of Mr Heydon's
opinions or of the free shares problem he had raised.  It involves an
assessment of their conduct as a whole, in order to determine
whether it should
properly be categorised as misleading conduct.  I do not think it should.  
<P>

1434	The solicitors provided Mr Heydon's opinions to the NRMA, to Ms Conway its
legal counsel in particular, and so the free shares
problem as perceived by Mr
Heydon, and the legal issue and risk which might have remained even with the
asterisk and explanation,
were made known to Ms Conway.  Ms Conway was a party
to the discussions on 2 August 1994 to the extent to which extension of the
free shares problem to the prospectus was there mentioned, and knew of the
perceived possibility.  Mr Morgan and Mr Bateman considered,
and here it is of
relevance that in my view they did so without negligence, that the free shares
problem identified by Mr Heydon
did not extend to the prospectus, and they said
so:  for the reasons I have given, the deficiency later found in the prospectus
in
relation to free shares and disadvantages was really different from that
which Mr Heydon had raised, and there was no negligence
in that respect.  As
explained when describing the facts, that Mr Heydon had identified the free
shares problem was not hidden, and
was made known beyond Ms Conway, including
to Mr McKay, the chairman of the due diligence committee and the President of
the NRMA.
 The solicitors could, of course, have done more, but that is not the
question;  the question is whether by not specifically bringing
to the
attention of the due diligence committee the free shares problem raised by Mr
Heydon, not addressing in the sign-off letters
the issues in Mr Heydon's
opinions of 2 and 3 August 1994, or not bringing those opinions up at the
committee and board meetings
in August 1994, they engaged in misleading
conduct.  In my opinion, in the circumstances it was not necessary that they do
so, or
to be expected that they would do so, and they did not.
<P>

1435	If there had been misleading conduct, there were competing submissions
over whether it was engaged in in trade or commerce.
 By the definitions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, trade or commerce "includes any business or professional
activity" and business included a trade or profession.  But AAH and AT
submitted that there was a distinction between the exercise of intellectual
skill, on the one hand, and representation about the
product of the exercise of
the intellectual skill, on the other hand, and that the former was not conduct
in trade or commerce; 
implicitly, they submitted that the misleading conduct
on which the NRMA relied was not in the trade or commerce category.  For the
distinction, AAH and AT cited <i>Prestia v Aknar</i>.  As I have said, it seems
that the NRMA put its case in the way it did in order better to counter this
submission.
<P>

1436	<i>Prestia v Aknar</i> was referred to in <i>Yates Property Corporation
Pty Limited v Boland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20145%20ALR%20169" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 145 ALR 169</a>, but it was unnecessary for Branson
J to explore or apply it.  Nor is it necessary in this case, and I resist AT's
invitation to
decide in any event whether the conduct of the solicitors was in
trade or commerce. 
<P>

1437	For completeness, I should record that the NRMA submitted that it suffered
loss or damage by the solicitors' misleading conduct
because that conduct in
turn caused the NRMA to engage in the relevant misleading conduct found by the
Federal Court and so brought
the wasted expenditure.  Whether there was the
causal link was disputed by the solicitors.  
<P>

1438	First, the solicitors said that the prospectus would have been left
unchanged even if Mr Morgan or Mr Bateman had brought the
free shares problem
raised by Mr Heydon to the attention of the due diligence committee, or the
boards, as something which might
render the prospectus misleading or deceptive.
It is important to recognise that the hypothesis is different from the advice
considered
earlier in these reasons in relation to causation in free
shares/disadvantages negligence.  The advice then considered was that the
NRMA
should delete the reference to the "free shares" in both the onsert and the
prospectus, or appropriately qualify that expression.
 The hypothesis is less
than that.  Consistently with the way in which the NRMA put its case, the
solicitors would not have engaged
in misleading conduct if they had told (for
example) the due diligence committees of Mr Heydon's opinions of 2 and 3 August
1994,
that Mr Heydon had left the possibility of risk in describing the shares
as free shares, but that they (the solicitors) considered
that the prospectus
was not open to challenge because of the free shares problem raised by Mr
Heydon because it sufficiently made
clear that the members were giving up their
membership rights.  If what I have earlier said be correct, the solicitors'
advice in
that respect was not negligent.  
<P>

1439	It is readily arguable that the boards would have been content to proceed
without changing the prospectus.  Causation in connection
with the misleading
conduct on which the NRMA relied is by no means clear, and the finding would be
influenced by the way in which
the hypothetical disclosure to the due diligence
committee, in the sign-off letters, or to the other committees or the boards,
was
framed, and with what accompanying or consequential advice from the
solicitors.  This was really not addressed in the evidence or
in submissions,
and I do not think it useful to go further into it.
<P>

1440	Secondly, it was said that, as with the claims for negligence, even if the
prospectus had been changed so as to avoid the misleading
conduct in relation
to free shares and disadvantages found by the Full Court, the wasted
expenditure would have been wasted anyway.
 The statutory test is whether the
wasted expenditure was loss or damage suffered "by" the misleading conduct of
the solicitors,
which denotes a causal relationship but does not confine relief
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> by analogy with claims in tort or contract (<i>Marks v
GIO Australia Holdings Ltd</i> at 16, 20, 31).  The submissions did not advert
to any difference in approach, when determining whether the wasted expenditure
was
recoverable as damages, between damages for breach of contract or
negligence on the one hand and damages as relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> on
the other hand.  In particular, the NRMA did not suggest that the test of loss
or damage suffered "by" the misleading conduct
of the solicitors in some manner
made it easier to achieve the objective it sought to achieve by invoking what
it said was the reasoning
in <i>McRae's case</i>.  
<P>

1441	Given that there must be a causal relationship, for essentially the same
reasons as earlier given I do not think that the wasted
expenditure is the
measure of the loss or damage suffered by the solicitors' misleading conduct,
and enquiry into whether the wasted
expenditure would have been wasted anyway
is just as appropriate.  What I have earlier said need not be repeated.
<P>

1442	I do not think that in the end even AT relied on s 1318(1) of the Law in
answer to this claim.  It is unnecessary to say anything
about whether failure
to mitigate loss and contributory negligence could be available to reduce the
claims against the solicitors,
or to say more about the allegations of failure
to mitigate loss and contributory negligence themselves.
<P>

<b>Involvement in Holdings' contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a></b>
<P>

1443	Again the statutory provisions have already been set out.  It was
necessary that Holdings engaged in misleading conduct in
trade or commerce,
that the NRMA suffered loss or damage by that conduct, and that AAH, AT and Mr
Heydon were involved in Holdings'
contravention.  
<P>

1444	The relevant contravention by Holdings had to be engaging in misleading
conduct with respect to free shares and disadvantages,
as found by the Full
Court, since only that contravention could be said to have led to the NRMA
suffering loss in the amount of the
wasted expenditure.  The NRMA simply relied
on the decision of the Full Court, saying that the defendants' accessory
liability "flows
<i>a fortiori</i> from the findings of breach in the Federal
Court".  
<P>

1445	The defendants replied, correctly, that they were not parties to the
proceedings in the Federal Court, and so the findings
and decision of the Full
Court did not bind them.  I have already noted that AAH submitted that there
was much more evidence before
me than was before the Federal Court, whereby a
decision different from that reached by the Full Court was dictated.  In
particular,
it was said that there was evidence before me but not before the
Federal Court which established that the disadvantages listed in
the Federal
Court judgment were "not disadvantages in any real or practical sense", and
that there was overwhelming evidence before
me to the effect that the
prospectus was in fact taken to convey that "free" in its context meant without
payment being required.
 So, it was submitted, the decision of the Full Court
was not even persuasive to the conclusion in these proceedings that Holdings
had relevantly engaged in misleading conduct.  
<P>

1446	I must decide for myself whether Holdings engaged in misleading conduct
with respect to free shares and disadvantages.  The
decisions of Gummow J and
the Full Court are, of course, entitled to earnest and respectful
consideration.  But there is no question
of following the decision of the Full
Court for reasons of comity, if for no other reason because neither that
decision nor my decision
turns on a debatable proposition of law, and each
turned and turns upon the particular facts before the Court and the reasoning
in
applying the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> to the facts.  I have already
indicated that I have difficulties with the reasons of the Full Court, and have
explained those difficulties.
 I do not lightly come to a conclusion different
from the conclusions to which Gummow J and the Full Court came, but I am not
satisfied
that Holdings engaged in misleading conduct as found by the Full
Court.  My reasons can be stated at three levels.  
<P>

1447	First, I have already endeavoured to analyse the reasoning of the Full
Court, arriving at the view that the free shares question
and the disadvantages
question merged and the vice in the prospectus was that there might have been
disadvantages in the proposal
not sufficiently identified and elaborated in the
prospectus.  I have suggested that it could not be said that the prospectus was
misleading unless the existence and significance of the postulated
disadvantages was established.  When that was not done, in my
respectful
opinion the reasoning to misleading conduct was deficient.
<P>

1448	Secondly, much earlier in these reasons I suggested grounds for concluding
that the possible disadvantages to which the Full
Court referred (disadvantages
(i) to (v) from the applicants' submissions and a further consideration added
by the Court) were not
disadvantages requiring identification, or were
disadvantages sufficiently identified and explained in the prospectus.  I find
those
grounds persuasive, and on the evidence before the Full Court I would not
reach the same conclusion as was reached by it in January
1995.  
<P>

1449	Thirdly, on the evidence before me I do not think that it has been
established that Holdings engaged in misleading conduct
as found and decided by
the Full Court.  With the advice of the solicitors that the prospectus had to
be balanced and had to identify
the disadvantages in the proposal, and under
the impetus of the agitation for presentation of a "no" case in the prospectus
and otherwise,
detailed and careful consideration was given by the directors
and the advisers to the disadvantages in the proposal.  In my opinion
there was
an adequate statement in the prospectus of the disadvantages of which the
directors were aware, and there were no other
disadvantages of significance
which were not identified and elaborated whereby distribution of the prospectus
was engaging in misleading
conduct.  The rights being given up were transitory,
even membership of Association depending on annual renewal, and as the Full
Court acknowledged were probably impossible of valuation.  Their value lay in
the control over exposure to disadvantages through
demutualisation, and so
depended on there being disadvantages of significance.  On the evidence before
me, I do not think that the
existence was established  of any such
disadvantages - by which I mean that they could rationally affect the members'
decision on
the proposal - not sufficiently disclosed in the prospectus.  The
most that could be said was that Mr Corrigan's view about possible
increase in
insurance premiums supported such a disadvantage, but cessation of insurance
rebates was clearly identified (a reason
for demutualisation was avoiding
artificially low premiums), and otherwise this fell within the broader issue of
pursuit of profits
and the culture of the NRMA.
<P>

1450	That would be sufficient for failure of these claims, but I should also
refer to whether the defendants were involved in what
I will assume to be a
contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> by Holdings.  
<P>

1451	In submissions the NRMA took up the groups of words in paras (a) and (c)
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, "aided, abetted, counselled or procured" and "in any
way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to".  It said
that
the words were satisfied because "the defendants' role was as counsellors to
the plaintiffs in connection with, and the substantial
draftsmen of and editors
of, the very documents which were found to be misleading or deceptive".  At
another point it said that the
conduct of the solicitors on which it relied as
misleading conduct, described earlier in these reasons, satisfied the words,
adding
that the solicitors were named in the prospectus, and that Mr Heydon was
involved in the contravention because he confirmed in his
opinion of 3 August
1994 that it was lawful for the onsert to be distributed and was silent "about
any other parts of the onsert
or the prospectus".
<P>

1452	Section 75B of the TP Act, and in particular the words in the
corresponding two paragraphs presently material, was considered
by the High
Court in <i>Yorke v Lucas</i>.  It was held that para (a) required intentional
participation in the contravention, and that to form the requisite intent the
participant
had to have knowledge of the essential matters which went to make
up the contravention.  It was held also that, for the purposes
of para (c), a
person could not be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he had
knowledge of the essential facts constituting
the contravention, and that a
person could only properly be said to be party to a contravention if his
participation was in the context
of knowledge of the essential facts
constituting the particular contravention.  The allegation in that case was
that Lucas was involved
in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act by his company,
in that the company, by Lucas, had falsely represented the turnover of its
business.  It was held that Lucas did not intentionally participate in the
contravention because he did not know of the falsity of
the representation.

<P>

1453	From the facts which I have set out, it is plain that Mr Heydon did not
have knowledge of the essential matters going to make
up the contravention
found by the Full Court.  He had knowledge of the contents of the prospectus at
most only via the draft prospectus,
in its form at or prior to 14 July 1994 in
the Perpetual brief.  At no time had he been called on to consider the adequacy
of disclosure
of disadvantages, and he had no knowledge of the disadvantages in
the proposal of which the directors were aware or should have been
aware.  Even
if he had been conscious of the use of the expression "free shares" in the
prospectus, his knowledge was far short of
that required for either para (a) or
(c) as construed in <i>Yorke v Lucas</i>, but as well I have accepted that he
was not conscious of that use.  For these reasons alone, quite apart from what
follows, Mr Heydon
was not involved in the assumed contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>
by Holdings.  
<P>

1454	The position is not quite so clear in relation to AAH and AT.  AAH
submitted that, absent dishonesty or no reasonable basis
for holding the
opinion that there was no misleading conduct in the distribution of the
prospectus, it did not have "the requisite
knowledge to attract accessorial
liability".  This was not developed.  AT submitted that the giving of
professional advice does not
constitute involvement within the meaning of s 75B
of the TP Act, referring generally to <i>Yorke v Lucas</i>, but again this was
not developed.  
<P>

1455	Because of what they did in and in relation to drafting and revising the
prospectus, and advising upon its compliance with
the law, the solicitors had
extensive knowledge of what it said and did not say and of what could have been
said.  No party attempted
an analysis of the essential facts constituting
Holdings' contravention, or of the solicitors' knowledge of those facts, and
absence
of dishonesty or a reasonable basis for holding that there was no
misleading conduct in the distribution of the prospectus is not
the same as
absence of knowledge of whatever may have been the essential facts.  <i>Yorke v
Lucas</i> was concerned with the knowledge required for accessory liability,
and did not decide that the giving of professional advice does
not constitute
involvement.  The submissions from the NRMA and the solicitors were not of much
assistance.
<P>

1456	In the absence of meaningful submissions, I do not propose to determine
whether the solicitors or either of them was involved
in the assumed
contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a> by Holdings.  Knowledge of the essential facts
alone is not sufficient for accessory liability.  There must be something more
constituting
involvement, within the groups of words, in the primary
contravention.  A person who is no more than an adviser may not be involved;
alternatively, it may be that a person who, though an adviser, is intimately
involved in the transaction giving rise to the contravention,
is involved.
<i>Sutton v A J Thompson Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2073%20ALR%20233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 73 ALR 233</a> may illustrate this, it
being found that the adviser played a significant part in the contravention by
keeping financial statements
from the plaintiff and accepting joint
responsibility for false statements about volumes of sales and prices:  he was
found to have
been "an intentional participant with full knowledge of the
essential elements of the contravention" (at 242-3).  Perhaps the key
is
whether the person is "linked in purpose" with the person committing the
primary contravention (see <i>R v Russell</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1933/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] VicLawRp 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%20VLR%2059" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) VLR 59</a> at 67;
<i>Giorgianni v R</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 473</a> at 479-80, 493; see also the
discussion of various forms of words expressing involvement in <i>Yorke v
Lucas</i> in the Full Federal Court  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2049%20ALR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 49 ALR 672</a> at 681-2).   If so, only
in unusual circumstances would an adviser incur accessory liability.  I have
endeavoured to find facts which
will enable this question to be determined
elsewhere, if necessary.
<P>

1457	Nothing more need be said about whether the wasted expenditure is the
measure of the loss or damage suffered by Holdings' assumed
conduct in
contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, about reliance on s 1318(1) of the Law, or about
failure to mitigate loss and contributory negligence.  Nor is it necessary to
say
anything about Mr Heydon's defence that the claim against him was statute
barred.
<P>

<b>Contravention of s 995(2) of the Law</b>
<P>

1458	In outlining the defences as filed I recorded that AAH and AT said that
s995(2) of the Law was not available to the NRMA, because
it had contravened
the provision itself and/or because it had itself issued or been involved in
issuing the prospectus, or because
it was not within the category of persons
who could rely on it.  Neither AAH nor AT put a submission taking up this
pleaded element
of its defence.  In those circumstances, I do not see why the
availability of s 995(2) should not be accepted, the question being
whether AAT
or AT contravened it.  In litigation of the present kind, where an issue has
been expressly pleaded but is not taken
up in submissions, it can and should be
concluded that it has been conceded in favour of the opponent.  In any event,
the conclusion
to which I have come makes the matter of no consequence.
<P>

1459	Again the statutory provisions have already been set out.  It was
necessary that AAH and AT engage in misleading conduct, that
they do so in
connection with a dealing in securities (using that description to encompass
the more complex sub-categories in s 995(2)(b)),
and that the NRMA suffered
loss or damage by that conduct.  Unlike the claim for contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT
Act</a>, it was not necessary that the misleading conduct be engaged in in trade or
commerce, but there had to be the connection with dealing
in securities.
<P>

1460	The NRMA's submissions were brief, namely that the solicitors' sign-off
letters and failures to warn it about the errors in,
and omissions from, the
prospectus constituted engaging in misleading conduct in relation to the
prospectus and/or in relation to
matters preparatory to the prospectus, being
particular sub-categories in s 995(2)(b).  The submissions took it for
granted that
there would be the requisite connection with dealing in
securities, that is, with the prospectus or with matters preparatory to the
prospectus.  
<P>

1461	This in substance took up the submission as to misleading conduct in
relation to contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FT Act</a>, and for the reasons I gave when
considering those claims I do not think that the solicitors engaged in
misleading conduct.  
<P>

1462	AT contested the connection with dealing in securities.  It submitted that
when an adviser gives advice it is not engaging
in conduct in relation to
dealing in securities, because the client's conduct intervenes between the
giving of advice and the dealing
in securities.  For the purposes of s 995(2),
it was said, the adviser's conduct was in relation to the client's conduct in
relation
to the dealing in securities.  The NRMA did not meaningfully respond,
and there was scanty attention to the matter.  It being necessary
to express a
view, I take the matter no further.
<P>

1463	Again nothing more need be said about whether the wasted expenditure is
the measure of the loss or damage suffered by assumed
conduct of the solicitors
in contravention of s 995(2), or about failure to mitigate and contributory
negligence.  It is unnecessary
to consider the reliance on exculpatory
provisions of the Law.  In submissions AAH took up only s 1011 and s 1318(1),
the former
only in passing, eschewing the complexity of ss 1006 and 1009.  The
thrust of its submission was that AAH was an expert (see 1006(2)(e))
and had
acted reasonably.  AT took up all of ss 1006 and 1009, s 1011, and s
1318(1).  The thrust of its submission was that AT was
named as a solicitor in
the prospectus and as performing that function (see s 1006(2)(g) and (h)),
implicitly that it was an expert
(see s 1006(2)(e)), and that it had reasonably
relied on the directors and otherwise acted reasonably.  There was the
reference to
<i>Daniels v Anderson</i> which I mentioned earlier.  The
submissions were sketchy, and I express no view on the availability or
application of these provisions.
<P>

<b>Contravention of s 996(1) of the Law.</b>
<P>

1464	The question of whether s 996(1) of the Law was available to the NRMA was
in the same position as the question of whether s
995(2) was available to it.
Extended also to Mr Heydon's defence as filed, and to the absence of a
submission taking up this pleaded
element of his defence, it should be
concluded that the issue has been conceded in favour of the NRMA.  Again, the
conclusion to
which I have come makes the matter of no consequence.
<P>

1465	Once more the statutory provisions have already been set out.  It was
necessary that AAH, AT and Mr Heydon authorised or caused
the issue of the
prospectus, that a material statement in the prospectus was false or misleading
or there was a material omission
from the prospectus, and that the NRMA
suffered loss or damage by the conduct of authorising or causing the issue of
the prospectus.

<P>

1466	The prospectus included a statement to the effect that AAH and AT (and
others) had not authorised or caused its issue.  It
was not submitted that this
statement carried weight against the NRMA, whose document the prospectus was,
as some kind of admission,
and I put it aside.  In formally giving its consent
to the issue of the prospectus with the references to it "in the form and
context
in which they appear", AT added to its letter, "Abbott Tout has not
authorised or caused the issue of the prospectus".  It was not
submitted that
this carried weight either.
<P>

1467	As to authorisation, the NRMA referred to <i>University of New South Wales
v Moorhouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20133%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 133 CLR 1</a> and<i> Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Copyright
Agency Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20136%20ALR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 136 ALR 273</a>, both copyright cases, for the adoption of a
broad view of authorisation by a dictionary meaning of "sanction, approve,
countenance"
and equation with "permit".  It submitted, in short, that the
solicitors authorised the issue of the prospectus because they gave
the
sign-off letters without warning of the deficiencies in the prospectus, and
that the solicitors and Mr Heydon authorised the
issue of the prospectus
because, being in a position to do otherwise, they let it go ahead.  
<P>

1468	The submission in relation to Mr Heydon was really quite fanciful.  In
more detail, it was that, being in a position to refuse
it, Mr Heydon gave his
sanction, approval or countenance for the publication and distribution of the
onsert on 3 August 1994 by confirming
that in his opinion it was lawful for it
to be distributed to members, and that by this sanction, approval or
countenance, coupled
with his silence about any other parts of the onsert or
the prospectus (which according to the submission he had seen in their
entirety),
he thereby authorised the issue of the prospectus.  At one point it
was said that Mr Heydon approved the onsert for distribution,
the onsert was
part of the prospectus, and so there was authorisation to distribute the
prospectus.  
<P>

1469	For reasons which by now will be apparent, even on the wide meaning of
authorisation put forward by the NRMA I do not think
it could sensibly be said
that Mr Heydon authorised the issue of the prospectus.  Whatever Mr Heydon did
was relevantly in connection
with the onsert, not the prospectus.  Neither the
NRMA nor its solicitors gave him a copy of the draft or the final version of
the
prospectus;  he was asked for advice on specific questions concerning the
transaction, and not at all about the prospectus;  he had
nothing to do with
the drafting or settling of the prospectus;  and he played no part in issuing
it and no role in which he was called
on to, or did, say that it should or
should not issue.  Undoubtedly Mr Heydon knew that a prospectus was to issue,
but he was never
in a position to say that the prospectus should not go ahead,
let alone to authorise the issue of the prospectus.
<P>

1470	AAH and AT had more to do with the prospectus and its issue.  Again in
more detail, the submission in relation to AAH and AT
was that, by the conduct
on which the NRMA relied as misleading conduct described earlier in these
reasons, plus being named in the
prospectus, they authorised the issue of the
prospectus because they did not warn of the deficiencies and instead gave the
sign-off
letters upon which, in a broad sense at least, the NRMA relied.
Although not made express, the reasoning must have been that the
solicitors
could have prevented the issue of the prospectus in its misleading form if they
had warned of the deficiencies, but they
did not do so and by failing to warn
permitted, even approved, the issue of the prospectus. 
<P>

1471	The parties' researches did not find any authority on when a person
authorises the issue of a prospectus.  I do not think that
the broad view of
authorisation in the context of the law of copyright can be transposed to s
996(1) of the Law.  Contravention of
s 996(1) carries potentially wide civil
liability, liability for loss or damage suffered by the contravening conduct.
Unlike contravention
of s 995(2) (see s 995(3)), it also constitutes an offence
(s 1311 of the Law) for which a substantial pecuniary penalty or imprisonment
for five years, or both, may be imposed.  Where their scope is unclear, a
confined rather than ample scope should be given to the
words "authorise or
cause the issue of a prospectus".  
<P>

1472	Those words postulate a specific event, the issue of a prospectus.  The
event will normally follow a conscious and relatively
formal decision that the
prospectus should issue.  The statement of the alternatives "authorise" and
"cause" gives colour to what
each means, causation being a more direct
connection with the happening of the event and authorisation being less direct,
but the
authorisation in my view must still be part of the decision-making
process.  The directors of the relevant company no doubt authorise
(and cause)
the issue of a prospectus, because they make the decision (cf <i>Flavel v
Giorgio</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%202%20ACSR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 2 ACSR 568</a>;  <i>Australian Securities Commission v Burns</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 545)</a>, but an adviser whose advice is taken into account by the
decision-makers is not relevantly part of the decision-making process.
 His
advice may affect the decision, but the decision is not his, and that remains
the case even if, had the adviser given advice
which if accepted would have
meant a negative decision, the adviser did not so advise.  
<P>

1473	Conceivably someone such as an underwriter may be regarded as part of the
decision-making process, because able to impose his
will on the issuer to
ensure the accuracy of disclosure, but  someone such as a solicitor will
normally not have that control or
even be concerned with the content of much of
the prospectus.  Unless there are unusual circumstances, a solicitor acting as
adviser
will not authorise the issue of the prospectus.  I do not think that in
the circumstances of the present case AAH or AT, or Mr Morgan
or Mr Bateman,
were relevantly part of the decision-making process, and in my opinion AAH and
AT did not authorise the issue of the
prospectus.
<P>

1474	As to causation, the NRMA referred to <i>Alphacell Ltd v Woodward</i>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%20AC%20824" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) AC 824</a> and <i>Empress Car (Abertilly) Ltd v National Rivers
Authority</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20All%20ER%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1 All ER 481</a> for causation according to the natural
consequences of intentional acts.  It said in its initial written submissions
that the defendants
caused the issue of the prospectus because the NRMA
"reasonably relied on their unqualified sign-offs in deciding to proceed to
publish
and circulate the document".  This hardly applied to Mr Heydon.  In
further written submissions the NRMA took up all that it had
relied on for
authorising the issue of the prospectus, saying that the same matters also made
out causing the issue of the prospectus.
 In oral submissions the cases just
mentioned were taken up.
<P>

1475	In <i>Alphacell Ltd v Woodward</i> it was held that Alphacell had caused
polluting material to enter a river, within the meaning of a statute concerned
with prevention
of pollution, because it had deliberately conducted a
manufacturing process involving an overflow into the river if pumps operated
defectively and the pumps had operated defectively.  Lord Wilberforce saw this
as giving a common sense meaning to causing (at 834);
 Viscount Dilhorne
applied the principle that a man may be said to cause results, even if he does
not intend them, if he "deliberately
and intentionally does certain acts of
which the natural consequence is that certain results ensue" (at 839-40);  Lord
Pearson appears
to have though it sufficient that there were "positive
activities" which "directly brought about the overflow", at least where no
other cause could be attributed (at 845);  and Lords Cross and Salmon appear to
have thought it sufficient for Alphacell to have
intentionally operated the
manufacturing process, again at least where no other cause could be attributed
(at 846, 847).
<P>

1476	In <i>Empress Car (Abertilly) Ltd v National Rivers Authority</i> Empress
was charged with causing polluting matter to enter a river, within the meaning
of a similar statute.  It had maintained a
diesel tank in a yard which drained
into the river.  An unknown person opened a tap so that the diesel drained from
the tank into
the yard and thence into the river.  It was held that there was
evidence on which it could be found that Empress had caused the pollution.
Lord Hoffmann, with whom Lords Browne-Wilkinson, Lloyd and Nolan agreed, said
that while the notion of causation should not be overcomplicated,
nor should it
be oversimplified (at 486), and his Lordship's speech included (at 487-9) -
<P>

"The first point to emphasise is that commonsense answers to questions of
causation will differ according to the purpose for which
the question is asked.
Questions of causation often arise for the purpose of attributing
responsibility to someone, for example,
so as to blame him for something which
has happened or to make him guilty of an offence or liable in damages.  In such
cases, the
answer will depend upon the rule by which responsibility is being
attributed.  Take, for example, the case of the man who forgets
to take the
radio out of his car and during the night someone breaks the quarterlight,
enters the car and steals it.  What caused
the damage?  If the thief is on
trial, so that the question is whether he is criminally responsible, then
obviously the answer is
that he caused the damage.  It is no answer for him to
say that it was caused by the owner carelessly leaving the radio inside. 
On
the other hand, the owner's wife, irritated at the third such occurrence in a
year, might well say that it was his fault.  In
the context of an inquiry into
the owner's blameworthiness under a non-legal, commonsense duty to take
reasonable care of one's own
possessions, one would say that his carelessness
caused the loss of the radio.
<P>

...
<P>

I turn next to the question of third parties and natural forces.  In answering
questions of causation for the purposes of holding
someone responsible, both
the law and common sense normally attach great significance to deliberate human
acts and extraordinary
natural events.  A factory owner carelessly leaves a
drum containing highly inflammable vapour in a place where it could easily be
accidentally ignited.  If a workman, thinking it is only an empty drum, throws
in a cigarette butt and causes an explosion, one would
have no difficulty in
saying that the negligence of the owner caused the explosion.  On the other
hand, if the workman, knowing exactly
what the drum contains, lights a match
and ignites it, one would have equally little difficulty in saying that he had
caused the
explosion for what he did.  One would probably say the same if the
drum was struck by lightning.  In both cases one would say that
although the
vapour-filled drum was a necessary condition for the explosion to happen, it
was not caused by the owner's negligence.
 One might add by way of further
explanation that the presence of an arsonist workman or lightning happening to
strike at that time
and place was a coincidence.
<P>

On the other hand, there are cases in which the duty imposed by the rule is to
take precautions to prevent loss being caused by
third parties or natural
events.  One example has already been given;  the common sense rule (not
legally enforceable, but neglect
of which may expose one to blame from one's
wife) which requires one to remove the car radio at night.  A legal example is
the well-known
case of <i>Stansbie v Troman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%202%20KB%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 2 KB 48.</a>  A decorator
working alone in a house went out to buy wallpaper and left the front door
unlocked.  He was held liable for the loss
caused by a thief who entered while
he was away.  For the purpose of attributing liability to the thief (eg in a
prosecution for
theft) the loss was caused by his deliberate act and no one
would have said that it was caused by the door being left open.  But
for the
purpose of attributing liability to the decorator, the loss was caused by the
negligence because his duty was to take reasonable
care to guard against
thieves entering.
<P>

These examples show that one cannot give a commonsense answer to a question of
causation for the purpose of attributing responsibility
under some rule without
knowing the purpose and scope of the rule.  Does the rule impose a duty which
requires one to guard against,
or makes one responsible for, the deliberate
acts of third persons?  If so, it will be correct to say, when loss is caused
by the
act of such a third person, that it was caused by the breach of duty.
<P>

...
<P>

Before answering questions about causation, it is therefore first necessary to
identify the scope of the relevant rule.  This is
not a question of common
sense fact;  it is a question of law.  In <i>Stansbie v Troman</i> the law
imposed a duty which included having to take precautions against burglars.
Therefore breach of that duty caused the loss
of the property stolen.  In the
example of the vapour-filled drum, the duty does not extend to taking
precautions against arsonists.
 In other contexts there might be such a duty
(compare <i>Mediterranean Freight Services Ltd v BP Oil International, The
Fiona</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 2 Lloyd's Rep 506</a> at 522) but the law of negligence would not
impose one."
<P>

1477	Again the parties' researches did not find any authority on when a person
causes the issue of a prospectus.  The cases to which
the NRMA referred were in
very different situations.  To ask whether the defendants or any of them
intentionally did acts which naturally
brought about the issue of the
prospectus, or some other question reflecting the approach in <i>Alphacell Ltd
v Woodward</i>, is not particularly helpful.  Lord Hoffman's speech is a
valuable reminder that the answer to a question of causation depends, amongst
other things, on why the question is asked, but for s 996(1) causation is
part of defining the extent of the duty, not a question
asked in the light of
the extent of the duty.
<P>

1478	In the present case many persons played a part in the issue of the
prospectus, but the issue of the prospectus was at all times
to be subject to
the decision of the NRMA - that was the point of its ultimate approval, and the
resolutions to proceed, at the board
meetings of Holdings, Association, and
Insurance on 18 August 1994.  The NRMA caused the issue of the prospectus.
That does not mean
that it can not be said that someone or something else
caused the issue of the prospectus (see <i>Empress Car (Abertilly) Ltd v
National Rivers Authority at 487).  </i>But the confined rather than ample
scope of the words "authorised or caused the issue of a prospectus" to which I
earlier referred
remains in point, and for essentially the same reasons as in
relation to authorising the issue of the prospectus I do not think that
Mr
Heydon caused the issue of the prospectus (the submission in that respect was
equally fanciful) or that the solicitors caused
the issue of the prospectus.
<P>

1479	Going to the next element in these claims, the NRMA submitted that the use
of the expression "free shares" and cognate expressions
repeatedly in the
prospectus gave rise to material statements which were false or misleading, and
that there was a material omission
from the prospectus because it stated that
there were disadvantages arising out of the proposal without describing or
explaining
those disadvantages.  For reasons earlier given, I do not so find.
Even if, therefore, AAH, AT or Mr Heydon had authorised the issue
of the
prospectus, s 996(1) was not in my view satisfied.
<P>

1480	Again nothing more need be said about whether the wasted expenditure is
the measure of loss or damage suffered by contravention
of s 996(1), or about
failure to mitigate and contributory negligence.  The position as to reliance
on the exculpatory provisions
of the Law was the same as for the claims under s
996(1).
<P>

<center><b>IX  CONTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE DEFENDANTS</b></center>
<P>

1481	If what I have said be correct, in relation to Gambotto liability each of
AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon is a tortfeasor liable in
respect of the damage suffered
by the NRMA as a result of a tort, within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR
Act</a>.  Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a>, each may recover contribution from each of the others
of an amount found by the Court "to be just and equitable having regard to
the
extent of [the other's] responsibility for the damage".  
<P>

1482	The measure of contribution is expressed in language reminiscent of that
guiding reduction of damages for contributory negligence,
and so calling for
regard to what was said in <i>Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2059%20ALJR%20492" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 59 ALJR 492</a> at 494 -
<P>

"The making of an apportionment as between a plaintiff and a defendant of their
respective shares in the responsibility for the
damage involves a comparison
both of culpability, ie of the degree of departure from the standard of care of
the reasonable man (<i>Pennington v Norris</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2096%20CLR%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 96 CLR 10</a> at 16) and of
the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage:

party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which
must be subjected
to comparative examination.  The significance of the various elements involved
in such an examination will vary
from case to case;  for example, the
circumstances of some cases may be such that a comparison of the relative
importance of the
acts of the parties in causing the damage will be of little,
if any, importance."
<P>

1483	The defendants' submissions were quite brief.  AAH asserted entitlement to
contribution, but said almost nothing about the
amounts.  AT submitted that no
contribution or minimal contribution should be found against it, saying that it
did not "carry the
retainer" relevant to Gambotto liability, that it was not
its advice which "set the parameters for structure and drafting", and that
Mr
Bateman's role was limited to one of pointing out extraordinary risks, usually
in the capacity of a lawyer sitting on a committee
which included many other
experts.  Mr Heydon submitted that he had specific and periodical involvement,
to be contrasted with the
close and continuous involvement and general overview
enjoyed by AAH and AT, and added that the extent of the respective involvements
was reflected in the much larger fees paid to AAH and AT.  
<P>

1484	I do not accept AT's characterisation of its position, nor do I think that
the respective fees or the fact that Mr Heydon's
involvement was not continuous
is of much significance.  AAH and AT were both required to, and did, address
the scheme or meeting
question, even if Mr Rees gave the primary carriage of
the question to Mr Morgan.  Mr Bateman continued to involve himself, including
by returning to the question in the course of the due diligence process.  For
the reasons I have given, the advice required of Mr
Heydon in December 1993
called for attention to risk to the proposal proceeding by the resolutions in
general meetings route.  While
Mr Heydon's opinion might have been regarded as
the principal factor in answering the scheme or meetings question, Mr Morgan
and
Mr Bateman were experienced corporate lawyers and, if Mr Heydon did not
adequately address the question, should have made sure that
he did;  they also
should have given thought to an analysis of the kind I described when dealing
with Mr Heydon's position.  In my
opinion the culpability and contribution of
AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon in and to the NRMA proceeding without Gambotto advice
should be
regarded as equal, and looking at the conduct of each of them just
and equitable contribution will be reached if there be equal contribution
between them.
<P>

1485	The cross-claims for contribution between the defendants were said to be
"in equity" as well as under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">LR Act</a>.  This was not amplified in
submissions.  Whether it was intended to assert differential contribution in
equity or equal contribution
as an equitable principle, the result would be no
different.  
<P>

<center><b>X  THE DEFENDANTS CLAIMS AGAINST THE NRMA</b></center>
<P>

1486	With the possible exception of the three further ways put forward by AT,
all the ways in which the defendants framed their
cross-claims against the NRMA
were concerned with the issue or distribution of the prospectus, and with
misleading conduct or misleading
content of the prospectus.  They do not avail
the defendants in relation to their Gambotto liability.  
<P>

1487	AT made but passing reference to its cross-claim against the NRMA, not
distinguishing between the ways in which it was put,
and nothing was said
making it apparent that the three further ways could be apt to, or might, avail
AT in relation to Gambotto liability.
 In any event, for the reasons I have
given, I do not think that there was any lack of reasonable care or other
default by the NRMA
in its own attention to risk to the proposal in connection
with Gambotto's case.  
<P>

1488	The cross-claims by the defendants against the NRMA should fail.
<P>

<center><b>XI  QUANTUM</b></center>
<P>

1489	In the course of the hearing the parties undertook an exercise in which
they agreed upon the amounts and other particulars
of the expenditure claimed
by the NRMA as wasted expenditure.  The defendants identified and described
what were called general disputes
and specific disputes in relation to those
amounts.  
<P>

1490	The amounts and other particulars of the expenditure were reduced to Scott
Schedule form, one Scott Schedule for external service
providers and other
Scott Schedule for internal costs.  The external service providers were all the
expenditure other than salaries
and wages of employees of the NRMA who worked
on the proposal, a wide notion of "service".  The internal costs were salaries
and
wages of employees of the NRMA who worked on the proposal.  Copies of the
Scott Schedules are appendix 2 and appendix 3 respectively
to these reasons.

<P>

1491	The Scott Schedules divided the expenditure according to when it was
incurred, and so it can be seen that the expenditure incurred
after 28 April
1994 was $25,139,852 made up of $23,870,124 for external service providers and
$1,269,728 for internal costs.  Save
so far as via the general disputes and the
specific disputes, the defendants did not submit that any of the amounts fell
outside
what was recoverable because the proposal was not put on hold.  The
NRMA's potential recovery for Gambotto liability is therefore
$25,139,852.  
<P>

	<b>The general disputes</b>
<P>

1492	In describing the general disputes, the defendants said that they should
not be read as limiting "the liability, causation,
remoteness, mitigation,
contributory negligence and other issues" on which they relied.  Nonetheless,
to a considerable extent the
general disputes were restatements of matters
already considered.
<P>

1493	The first general dispute was said to be that if any of the defendants had
free shares/disadvantages liability but not Gambotto
liability, "all loss and
damage was caused by Gambotto".  The meaning of this was unclear, but it does
not matter.  The defendants
have Gambotto liability but not free
shares/disadvantages liability.
<P>

1494	The second general dispute was said to be that the only loss or damage
caused by conduct of any defendant giving rise to free
shares/disadvantages
liability was "the cost of fixing up the prospectus by issue of a supplementary
prospectus", and that since
a supplementary prospectus was not issued there was
no loss or damage;  alternatively, the loss or damage was limited to the
reasonable
cost of the issue of a supplementary prospectus if it had occurred.
Again, in the absence of free shares/disadvantages liability,
this does not
arise.  I have made reference to issuing a supplementary prospectus, and it is
unnecessary to say more.
<P>

1495	The third general dispute was said to be that any loss or damage caused by
conduct of any defendant "in respect of Gambotto"
was limited to "the cost of
attempting to implement the existing proposal by way of scheme of arrangement",
and that since no scheme
was sought to be implemented there was no loss or
damage;  alternatively, the loss or damage was limited to the reasonable cost
of
such a scheme if it had occurred.  For reasons which I have given, I do not
accept this.
<P>

1496	The fourth general dispute was said to be that "even if the proposal
proceeded, the plaintiffs would have incurred the expenses
they did and there
is no evidence as to whether or not the plaintiffs are better or worse off
under the proposal".  This was not
explained, but appears to have reflected the
submission that the NRMA's claimable loss was the difference in money terms
between
the NRMA demutualised and the NRMA under its present structure.  It is
unnecessary to say any more on this point.
<P>

1497	The fifth and last general dispute was said to be that "any quantification
of expense must be discounted (including to nil)
by the prospect that the
proposal would not have proceeded in any event, especially without the impugned
elements (repetition of
`free shares' and formulation of advantages and
disadvantages)".  Examples were given, some not obviously related to the
statement
of the dispute.  This also was not explained.  In referring to
discounting it appeared to suggest a "loss of a chance" approach,
which the
defendants did not contend for any more than the NRMA.  Possibly the defendants
had in mind the kind of reduction in damages
to which I referred in relation to
<i>Chappel v Hart</i>, there reduction to reflect the possibility, that,
independently of the defendant's omission, the plaintiff would have sustained
her injury at a later time.  If so, for reasons already given it does not apply
in relation to Gambotto liability.  This general
dispute, as with some of the
others, seemed to represent an early statement of the defendants' positions,
those positions being changed
and perhaps refined as the hearing proceeded and
in submissions.  Again, it is not necessary to say anything further. 
<P>

1498	No doubt in part because of the evolution of the general disputes, there
were two more general disputes which must be addressed.
 
<P>

1499	First, AT submitted that the amount recoverable by the NRMA was capped
because its financial statements for 1997 "provide an
admission on the maximum
amount of [its] loss".  It referred to <i>Stevinson Hardy &amp; Co Ltd v Smith
Wylie (Australia) Ltd</i> (1939) 39 SR 388 at 407;  <i>Potts v Miller</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1940/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2064%20CLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 64 CLR 282</a> at 292, 301-5;  and <i>The Stage Club Ltd v Millers Hotels
Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 71</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20150%20CLR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 150 CLR 535</a> at 542-4, 551, 554.  
<P>

1500	The submission was misconceived.  The cases cited were concerned with
admissibility of financial records and statements and,
as to the third case,
acknowledgment of a debt.  They supported that the financial statements
provided evidence of the NRMA's loss,
but not that the amount recoverable was
capped.
<P>

1501	A note to the consolidated accounts part of the financial statements
referred to these proceedings and said that "any recoveries
received would
offset the $2,473,000 and $22,257,000 expensed during the 1994 and 1995
financial years by NRMA Insurance Limited
and NRMA Limited, respectively".  If
the NRMA were held to a maximum amount of its loss of $24,730,000, how an
apportionment could
be made to isolate the loss in relation to Gambotto
liability, or to take account of the specific disputes raised by the
defendants,
was not explained.  But the NRMA is not so held.  
<P>

1502	Treating the note, at best for AT, as an admission, it is only one piece
of evidence going to establish the amount of the NRMA's
expenditure.  What lies
behind it is unknown.  It is overwhelmed by the detailed information in the
Scott Schedules, backed up in
the case of the external service providers by
seven folders of documents and out of court investigation by the defendants
which enabled
them to agree upon the amounts in the Scott Schedule and raise
their general and specific disputes, and in the case of the internal
costs by
witness statements of most of the relevant employees (as recorded in the Scott
Schedule).  Few of the employees were required
for cross-examination, and the
cross-examination was not directed to the figures.  Notwithstanding what was
said in the financial
statements, the NRMA's potential recovery for Gambotto
liability remains at $25,139,582.
<P>

1503	Secondly, it follows from my finding that the proposal would have been put
on hold, other than for limited activity by management
to further develop it,
that there would have been some expenditure between 28 April 1994 and the
decision of the High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i>.  The NRMA would have
obtained advice on the decision of the High Court.  There must be an allowance
for that expenditure.  
<P>

1504	In referring to activity by management to further develop the proposal
there should not be excluded expenditure on external
service providers, as in
the further development management would have obtained the services of, for
example, BT, PJP, C &amp; L,
possibly Woolcott, and the solicitors.  The extent
to which the services of external service providers would have been used, and
the extent to which employees of the NRMA would have been committed to the
further development, and consequently the amount of any
expenditure, were
really not gone into in the evidence or in submissions.  An estimate must be
made, notwithstanding the difficulty
and uncertainty involved (cf <i>Fink v
Fink</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1946/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2074%20CLR%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 74 CLR 127</a> at 143;  the <i>Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty
Ltd</i> at 83, 102, 125, 153).  In the circumstances, the estimate is of
necessity little more than a guess (<i>Jones v Schiffmann</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20124%20CLR%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 124 CLR
303</a> at 308). 
<P>

1505	For reasons which will appear, I confine the estimate to the external
service providers.  By 28 April 1994 the proposal was
well developed, the major
work thereafter being detailed work which is unlikely to have proceeded.
Bearing in mind the expenditure
to 17 March 1994, when the more fundamental
development of the proposal was in hand, of approximately $3,200,000 and that
the total
expenditure on external service providers of the kinds whose services
would to some extent have continued was something like $4,500,000,
in my
estimation the maximum reasonable expenditure would be $500,000.  The burden of
proof bring on the NRMA, I make an allowance
of $500,000.
<P>

	<b>The specific dispute</b>
<P>

1506	The defendants described ten specific disputes, designated A, B, C, D, E,
F, H, J, K and M.  The intermediate letters were
used to designate other
specific disputes which fell away.  The designations can be seen against the
amounts in the Scott Schedules
to which the defendants said they related, in
the column headed "Dispute as to principle".
<P>

1507	Specific dispute A was concerned with the internal costs as a whole, the
amount of $1,269,728 incurred after 28 April 1994.
 The defendants submitted
that there was no loss or damage relating to employees "because there is no
evidence of incurrence of abnormal
or additional expense in this respect by
reason of the proposal".  It is correct that there was no such evidence, for
example of
hiring additional employees or working overtime, or even that the
NRMA's staff would have been reduced but for the demands of the
proposal.  So
far as the evidence showed, the NRMA would have paid by way of salaries and
wages what it in fact paid over the years
1992-94, whether the employees were
working on the proposal or not.  
<P>

1508	The NRMA submitted that the internal costs were nonetheless recoverable,
referring to <i>McRae's case</i> and to <i>Tate &amp; Lyle Food Distribution
Ltd v Greater London Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20WLR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 WLR 149.</a>  In <i>McRae's case</i> the
wasted expenditure claimed included an amount of &#163;154 office expenses, as
to which Dixon and Fullager JJ said (at 418) that
"[i]t seems reasonable to
suppose that some office expenses were incurred and wasted, and, though nothing
much better than a guess
is possible, it is probably fair enough to add
&#163;100 for these".  In <i>Tate &amp; Lyle Food Distribution Ltd v Greater
London Council </i>the defendant's negligence required that the plaintiff
dredge part of a river, and it was held that the expenditure of managerial
time, described as additional managerial time, could properly form the subject
of a head of special damage.  No amount was recovered,
because the plaintiff
had not kept records to show what was described as "the extent to which their
trading routine was disturbed
by the necessity for continual dredging
sessions", and the court was not prepared to strike a speculative percentage of
managerial
time, but the NRMA said that in the present case there were
records.
<P>

1509	Neither of these cases really answered the defendant's submission.  Both
the office expenses and the costs underlying the expenditure
of additional
managerial time may have been regarded by the parties, and the courts, as
expenditure which would otherwise not have
been incurred, and the judgments do
not address the present question.  A similar question has arisen, however, in
relation to claims
in construction cases for a percentage allowance for
overheads, and the defendants relied on the reasoning found in my decisions
in
<i>Thiess Watkins White Construction Ltd v The Commonwealth</i> (1992) 14 BCL
61 at 77-78 and <i>Bulk Materials (Coal Handling) Pty Ltd v Compressed Air
&amp; Packing Systems (NSW) Pty Ltd</i> (1997) 14 BCL 109 at 134-135 and the
cases there considered.  In short, and putting aside whether the defendants
wrong inhibited
the earning of income to defray the normal overheads, unless it
be established that additional or increased overhead costs were incurred
by
reason of the wrong, and that the increased or additional costs are
appropriately measured by the suggested percentage, a percentage
claim to
overheads can not be recovered.  
<P>

1510	In the same way, in my view, unless it is established that the NRMA paid
additional or increased salaries and wages which would
not have been paid had
the proposal been put on hold, being expenditure properly measured by taking
the salaries and wages of the
employees who worked on the proposal as set out
in the Scott Schedule, the internal costs are not recoverable.  As I have said,
the
NRMA has not established this.  The internal costs have not been shown to
have been costs which would not have been incurred if the
proposal were put on
hold.  On the contrary, I consider that in the state of the evidence the only
proper conclusion is that the
amounts of the salaries and wages paid to
employees as listed in the Scott Schedule would have been paid in any event.
Accordingly,
I do not think that the NRMA can recover the internal costs.  An
"allowance" of $1,269,728 should be made.
<P>

1511	I will not go through the detailed submissions as to each employee's work
in connection with the proposal.  In the further
specific disputes I will
restrict consideration to expenditure on external service providers, save as to
specific dispute B where
reference to the work of the NRMA employees is
necessary to understand the dispute.  
<P>

1512	Specific dispute B was said to be concerned with expenditure in relation
to the NRMA's members registers.  Some of the external
service providers and
some of the NRMA's employees provided services in relation to, or worked on,
revision of the members registers
in the period prior to 19 October 1994.  The
external services included establishing and staffing a Share Information Centre
to deal
with members' queries in response to the entitlements letters.  The
external service providers in question are too numerous to list,
and included
diverse providers such as professionals, marketers, envelope makers, Telecom,
and Australia Post.  The defendants said
that the expenditure for all these
purposes was not recoverable because it had "enduring value" for the NRMA.  
<P>

1513	Association and Insurance were required by law to maintain registers of
members containing the names and addresses of the members,
the date at which
the name of each person was entered in the register as a member, and the date
at which any person who ceased to
be a member during the previous seven years
so ceased to be a member.  Unless the registers themselves constituted indices,
they
also had to keep indices in convenient form of the names of the members.
The registers and indices had to be open for inspection.
 
<P>

1514	The NRMA had a database, the so-called identity database, containing the
names and addresses of members of Association and
customers of Insurance.  The
identity database was used, inter alia, to prepare members registers, as the
basis for mailing lists
for the Open Road, and as the basis for marketing
campaigns.  It did not throw up an accurate members register for Insurance,
principally
because members of Association and policy holders were not matched,
but also because there was duplication where memberships or policies
were in
joint names, where there had been changes of name, where there had been changes
of address, and for other reasons.  Inspection
of the registers of members was
possible only by accessing the identity database or running a programme to
create a hard copy members
registers, and in the case of Insurance that could
not adequately be done.  
<P>

1515	Quite apart from the demutualisation, therefore, it was necessary for the
NRMA to do work on the identity database and otherwise
in order to have the
members registers required by law.  The proposal was clearly enough the impetus
for this work.  When the Christmas
Project was established it was recognised
that the membership records were unsatisfactory.  In November 1993 it was
decided "that
a project be undertaken" to fix the problem of a members register
for Insurance.  Minutes of a meeting on 23 February 1993 recorded
"HC to
advance the rationalisation of polyholders [sic] and membership data bases",
and minutes of a meeting on 2 March 1993 referred
to "incomplete records of
membership" of Insurance and recorded that there was to be "work on fixing the
data records".  
<P>

1516	Work was done to establish a system for matching members of Association
and policyholders in a way which would allow the production
of a members
register for Insurance, and a so-called clean-up of the identity database to
eliminate duplications was carried out
by about mid-April 1994.  But the work
done went much further.  Because the entitlements differed according to length
of membership
and the holding of policies issued by Insurance, separation of
members into appropriate categories was required.  So as well as the
clean-up
of the identity database and the production of a membership database, an
entitlements database was brought into existence.
 This was done by the end of
May 1994, and the cleaned-up identity database and the entitlements database
were used to send out the
entitlements letters.  
<P>

1517	One of the purposes of the entitlements letters was to assist the NRMA to
verify memberships and lengths of memberships and
insurance policies held, and
corrections were thereafter made.  With the benefit of the responses to the
entitlements letters, the
NRMA created voting registers for Association and
Insurance which reflected the entitlements.  
<P>

1518	The defendants submitted that all the services and work were of enduring
value because, although they went to creation of the
voting registers and
entitlements database, they also went to the creation of a more accurate
database for use inter alia in mailing
the Open Road and for marketing
campaigns, and also enabled the NRMA to produce the members registers required
by law.  
<P>

1519	The notion of enduring value, much spoken of in the course of the hearing,
was never really made clear.  It seemed to be a
response to the NRMA's
description of its loss as wasted expenditure.  It made more sense in relation
to wasted expenditure as claimed
for free shares/disadvantages liability than
in relation to the expenditure, also described as wasted expenditure, claimed
for Gambotto
liability.  The latter expenditure was more correctly expenditure
which would not have been incurred had the proposal been put on
hold.  
<P>

1520	Much of the expenditure in relation to the members registers,
understanding that in a wide sense, had been incurred before
28 April 1994.
The expenditure thereafter was generally to do with sending out the
entitlements letters and the conduct of the intended
general meetings, or
consequent on the entitlements letters.  Had the boards voted to put the
proposal on hold towards the end of
April 1994, it is clear enough that the
entitlements letters would not have gone out.  Would the work in relation to
the members
registers have continued?  On the probabilities, I do not think it
would.  The NRMA had functioned with an imperfect identity database
prior to
1994, the imperfection had been largely corrected, and putting the proposal to
the members in the general meetings was the
occasion for the continuation of
the work.  There is a degree of speculation in this, as there was no evidence
specifically directed
to whether the work would have continued as distinct from
the notion of enduring value, but I consider that I may properly come to
that
conclusion.  
<P>

1521	It is unnecessary to say anything of the extent, at first sight difficult
to justify, to which by their B designations in the
Scott Schedules the
defendants sought to apply this specific dispute:  the expenditure after 28
April 1994 so designated totalled
$7,039.651.  The expenditure of the kind
described by the defendants would not have been incurred if the proposal had
been put on
hold.  I do not think any allowance for the so-called "enduring
value" in question should be made.  
<P>

1522	Specific dispute C was concerned with other expenditure said by the
defendants to have been of enduring value.  The defendants
gave this
designation to all the BT costs, some of the C &amp; L costs, some of the DTT
costs, all the PJP costs, all the costs of
SMS Consulting Group Pty Ltd
("SMS"), and all the Grant Samuel costs.  The expenditure after 28 April 1994
so designated totalled
$2,289,944.  
<P>

1523	In short, and apart from an additional submission in relation to SMS, the
defendants' submission was that on 27 May 1995 the
NRMA had resolved not to
proceed with the meeting originally called for 19 October 1994 or with the
prospectus, but had remained
intent on putting to members a restructuring of
the organisation for the reasons set out in the Grant Samuel report;  that
there
was no evidence that this objective, including a possible
demutualisation, had been abandoned;  and that the work of these external
service providers could be reused in a future restructuring and had enduring
value to the NRMA.  Only part of the relevant expenditure
was challenged, in
that it was said that the work could be reused in part, and how an
apportionment should be made was unclear.
<P>

1524	Any enduring value is highly debatable, and even if the submission
otherwise had merit the consequence would certainly not
be an allowance for all
the expenditure to which the defendants gave the C designation - indeed,
putting a figure on the enduring
value would probably be impossible.  It does
not matter.  As with special dispute B, the true question is whether the NRMA
would
have incurred the expenditure had the proposal been put on hold on or
about 28 April 1994.  Some of the expenditure designated as
C expenditure would
not have been affected by a stay on the demutualisation, and to the extent to
which expenditure of that kind
would have been incurred it is accommodated by
the allowance of $500,000 to which I have earlier referred.  No further
allowance
under specific dispute C should be made.  
<P>

1525	The C&amp;L costs in the Scott Schedule included the costs for services in
connection with the 31 March 1994 audit for inclusion
in the prospectus.  The
NRMA conceded that as a result of the work done in preparing for this audit
there was a saving to it in the
costs for services in connection with the
normal 30 June 1994 audit.  The saving was estimated at $100,000.  However,
since the expenditure
preceded 28 April 1994, and is not initially part of the
NRMA's damages now in question, no allowance for the sum should be made.
<P>

1526	As to SMS, it was obliquely submitted (as part of specific dispute C,
although in truth a separate dispute) that there was
no satisfactory evidence
"about what SMS did, how satisfactory or otherwise it was, and how it was
relied upon".  The point may have
been that without such evidence it had not
been established that the expenditure did not have enduring value, or it may
have been
that it had not been established that the expenditure would not have
been incurred if the proposal had been put on hold.  In case
it was the latter,
SMS provided the services of Mr Hosking.  If the proposal had been put on hold,
I consider that on the probabilities
his services would have been dispensed
with.
<P>

1527	Specific dispute D was concerned with the distribution of the Grant Samuel
report and the process of consultation at that time.
 The defendants said that,
to the extent that there was no enduring value for the report, any expenditure
after the decision of the
High Court in <i>Gambotto's case</i> on 8 March 1995
was "unjustified", and alternatively that the expenditure was "too remote from
the proposal".  Since other expenditure
after 8 March 1995 was the subject of a
specific dispute, I take the defendants' position to be confined to expenditure
of the kind
I have described.  The amounts designated D in the Scott Schedule
did not include the fees of Grant Samuel itself, those fees being
subject to
specific dispute C.  They covered a number of external service providers,
including Telecom, Woolcott and S&amp;S.  The
expenditure designated D, all
after 28 April 1994, totalled $573,038.
<P>

1528	When dealing with the facts I have explained why the Grant Samuel report
was distributed and, without going into detail, that
advertisements were
placed, public consultation meetings were held, and market research was
undertaken.  Justification is not the
issue when the NRMA's damages are the
expenditure it would not have incurred had the proposal been put on hold.  Had
the proposal
been put on hold on or about 28 April 1994, there would not have
been the distribution of the prospectus, the litigation in the Federal
Court,
and what was undoubtedly divisive public contention.  There may or may not have
been occasion for a further report such as
the Grant Samuel report, and the
specific disputes seemed to accept that there would not have been occasion for
that report because
challenging the fees of Grant Samuel only on enduring value
grounds under specific dispute C.  On the probabilities, in my view,
there
would not have been a report such as the Grant Samuel report, or the Grant
Samuel report itself, and there would not have been
the process of distribution
and consultation involving the other report or the Grant Samuel report.  The
issue, then, is whether
the expenditure on the process of distribution and
consultation in fact incurred was too remote - not too remote "from the
proposal",
but remote in law.  
<P>

1529	The expenditure presently in question will not be recoverable as damages
for the solicitors' breaches of contract unless it
was such as might fairly and
reasonably be considered as arising naturally, that is, according to the usual
course of things, from
the breaches of contract themselves, or such as might
reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of all parties at
the
time they made the contracts as the probable result of the breaches of the
contracts (<i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281854%29%209%20Exch%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1854) 9 Ex 341</a> at 355;  156 ER 145 at
151;  <i>Koufos v C Czarnikow Ltd</i> (1969) 1 AC 350 at 388, 406, 410-11,

310</a> at 363-6).  Nor will the expenditure be recoverable as damages for the
defendants' breaches of duty unless it was of a class or kind
which was
reasonably foreseeable as the result of the wrongful act or omission
(<i>Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd (The
Wagonmound) (No 1)</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1961/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20AC%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) AC 388</a> at 426;  <i>Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v

Credit Corporation Ltd </i>at 360, 366<i>.</i>).  
<P>

1530	Litigation such as the Federal Court proceedings, and the divisive public
contention, were undoubtedly foreseeable, and it
is sufficient to recall the
concern over spoiling tactics - it does not matter that the particular
manifestation so far as it involved
free shares and disadvantages may not have
been foreseen.  That the NRMA would publicise the proposal, even engage in
marketing strategies
intended to achieve a successful outcome, and would
receive and respond to members' reactions and comments was no doubt also
foreseeable.
 But I do not think that a process of distribution and
consultation of the kind in which the NRMA engaged in April-May 1995 was
foreseeable,
using that word as shorthand for the more accurately stated
principles.  I consider that specific dispute D should be decided in
favour of
the defendants on grounds of remoteness.  
<P>

1531	The NRMA did not say that any of the amounts so designated fell outside
specific dispute D if the dispute of principle were
determined in favour of the
defendants.  An allowance of $573,038 should be made.  
<P>

1532	Specific dispute E was concerned with what was described as corporate
advertising.  The defendants said that part of the expenditure
was "not
additional expenditure".  The amounts designated E in the Scott Schedule were
the entirety of the payments to S&amp;S, a
total of $3,099,360 from March 1994
to February 1995 inclusive, plus $134,838 paid to the NRMA company responsible
for The Open Road,
The Open Road Pty Limited, at the end of 1994. 
<P>

1533	The expenditure in favour of S&amp;S incurred prior to 28 April 1994,
$162,520, may be put aside, and it should not be forgotten
that the dispute
challenged only portion of the expenditure.  The defendants' submission was
that to a large extent advertising expenditure
on the proposal was not
additional expenditure, but was merely money which "would have been spent on
corporate advertising anyway".
 
<P>

1534	A marketing plan and budget in relation to the proposal dated 14 April
1994, submitted by Mr Salvage and recording the research
and four key issues
mentioned when considering whether the proposal would have gained the necessary
75 per cent approval, showed
gross expenditure on television advertising of
$745,250, but recorded that "the TV media schedule for this campaign will allow
a
reduction in the normal corporate TV schedule to the value of $536,000".  The
total budget was $1,940,000.  In early June 1994 Mr
Salvage wrote to Mr Rees
and Ms Conway about forthcoming advertising for a three week period, recording
costs of $180,000 for the
production of the television material, $300,000 for
the television media, and $100,000 for the press media, and stating that those
activities and costs "are substantially replacing normal advertising" so that
the net additional cost to the NRMA was not great.
 On this material, the
defendants submitted that it should be inferred that something like 70 per cent
of the amounts paid to S&amp;S,
through whom the corporate advertising was
arranged and paid, would have been incurred for normal advertising if there had
been no
demutualisation proposal at all.  Although not specifically directed to
Gambotto liability, the submission would extend to expenditure
on normal
advertising if the proposal had been put on hold.  
<P>

1535	The NRMA is entitled to recover only the net expenditure on corporate
advertising, after an allowance for the expenditure which
was not incurred
because the proposal proceeded.  While the evidentiary basis was slim, there
was nothing of significance to deny
the conclusion from the material to which
the defendants referred that an allowance should be made.  The difficulty is to
arrive
at an amount.  
<P>

1536	I was not referred to anything else in the evidence to assist in arriving
at an allowance.  The ratio of $536,000 to $745,250
may not have applied over
the whole of the relevant period, and there was evidence that the advertising
plan involved three stages
for advertising in relation to the proposal, in
March, June and September-October 1994.  The reason for these months is
obvious.
 From Mr Salvage's memorandum, the total of $580,000 for a three week
period "substantially" replaced normal advertising, so the
normal expenditure
on advertising must have been high.  Once again, an estimate close to a guess
must be made.  The corporate advertising
in connection with the proposal would
not have substantially replaced normal advertising uniformly, and the amounts
paid to S&amp;S
in the latter part of 1994 and early 1995 may not have been in
the same position as the amounts earlier paid when Mr Salvage prepared
the
marketing plan and budget and wrote the memorandum.  In all the circumstances,
on my estimation an allowance of 50 per cent of
the S&amp;S expenditure
incurred after 28 April 1994 should be made, a figure of $1,468,420.
<P>

1537	As to the amount paid to The Open Road Pty Ltd, the NRMA conceded that
-
<P>

"With the exception of the costs of external legal sign-off, there was incurred
by the plaintiffs in producing material in respect
of or in relation to the
Share the Future proposal for inclusion in any edition of the `Open Road'
magazine no cost additional to
that which would have been incurred by the
plaintiffs in producing the substitute or alternative material that would
otherwise have
been included in the `Open Road' magazine."
<P>

The defendants said that the damages should therefore not include this amount,
alternatively that the payment was only an intra-group
charge and it had not
been shown that it represented a production cost actually incurred by The Open
Road Pty Ltd.  
<P>

1538	I see no sufficient reason to treat the charge as anything other than a
proper commercial charge, but on the NRMA's concession
it replaced expenditure
which would otherwise have been incurred.  The NRMA submitted that the work had
nevertheless been wasted.
 This gave the notion of wasted expenditure a new,
and unsustainable, application.  An allowance of $134,838 should be made.
<P>

1539	Specific dispute F was concerned with $100,000 paid to Were on 1 June
1995.  The defendants said that a "credit for any future
float in invoiced fees
[was] not deducted from plaintiff's claim". 
<P>

1540	Were was engaged in June 1994 as lead manager for the proposed public
listing of Holdings.  Mr Brad Rees, refrerred to when
recounting the facts, was
from Were.  It was entitled to a particular fee if Holdings was listed and
payment on hourly rates if it
was not.  In May 1995 it submitted an account for
a round figure of $100,000, the covering letter stating that it "includes an
amount
of $29,925.00 in respect of work which can be carried forward to a
subsequent NRMA float process and which will therefore be rebated
against fees
for such a future appointment".  When the account was paid, the NRMA's covering
letter noted this statement.  
<P>

1541	The expenditure of the full $100,000 would not have been incurred if the
proposal had been put on hold.  No question of rebating
the $29,925 against
fees for a future float would have arisen.  Assuming nonetheless that regard
should be had to the promised rebate,
it would only benefit the NRMA in the
event of a future float for which Were was engaged.  On the evidence, such an
event is entirely
speculative, and I do not think any allowance should be made
in respect of the $29,925.00.
<P>

1542	Specific dispute H was concerned with part of the fees paid to AAH and AT.
The defendants said that part of the services provided
by AAH and AT had
enduring value, being work during the due diligence process to ensure that the
NRMA complied with the Credit Act
and work to do with ownership of the
intellectual property in software of one of the NRMA companies.  The defendants
did not identify
any particular amounts;  indeed, their submissions (by AT,
adopted by AAH and possibly by Mr Heydon) did not refer to any relevant
evidence and were little more than as I have stated.
<P>

1543	It was accepted, as I understand it, that the relevant services were
provided by AAH and AT as part of the work towards the
implementation of the
proposal.  It is far from clear that, in the end, this dispute was maintained.
The NRMA's written submissions
in reply included that "AAH Credit Act advice"
had been the subject of agreement and adjustment to the amount claimed.  There
was
in fact no designation H in the Scott Schedule.  No one indicated whether
the relevant work was done before or after 28 April 1994.
<P>

1544	Probably the dispute was not maintained, but it does not matter.  As
before, the question of enduring value is not the correct
question.  Would the
services have been provided if the proposal had been put on hold?  The
defendants did not refer to any evidence,
or any reasoning, by which that
conclusion should be reached.  As I have said, they did not identify the
amounts.  I do not think
any allowance should be made.
<P>

1545	Special dispute J was concerned with expenditure incurred over the
approximate period June 1994 - February 1995 inclusive for
services provided by
SOCOM Public Relations.  The dispute as described by the defendants was "no
recognition of requirement to give
30 days' notice of calculation at
significant timing dates".  The total amount was $18,822.50.  
<P>

1546	AAH's written submissions stated that it would address this dispute
orally.  It did not.  Nor did AT or Mr Heydon.  What the
dispute was is
unknown, it must have been abandoned, and no allowance should be made.
<P>

1547	Specific dispute K was described by the defendants as "no or inadequate
supporting evidence".  Only one amount was given this
designation, $90,029
incurred in favour of Customnet prior to 28 April 1994.  It and the dispute are
not material to the damages
for Gambotto liability.
<P>

1548	Specific dispute M was concerned with some of the expenditure incurred for
the services of S&amp;S.  A number of amounts in
the Scott Schedule incurred
over the approximate period July 1994 - December 1994 inclusive were designated
M, totalling $880,487
and the defendants' description of the dispute was that
the amounts were "not reasonably paid, since the advertisements were the
subject of challenge by the Trade Practices Commission or were the corrective
advertising consequent on the settlement of the TPC
challenge".  
<P>

1549	AAH specifically did not take up this dispute.  AT said only that it had
no responsibility for advertising which the TPC sought
to challenge, or for the
costs of its correction as a consequence of the compromise between the TPC and
the NRMA.  Mr Heydon said
nothing on the matter.  
<P>

1550	Despite the designation M of expenditure prior to that time, presumably
the expenditure in question was that to do with the
advertising which brought
objections and corrective advertising in and perhaps after September 1994
(although whether the later designated
expenditure was corrective advertising
is unclear).  It does not matter that AT was not involved in the advertising or
its consequences.
 The expenditure on the advertising would not have been
incurred if the proposal had been put on hold.  That there would be such
expenditure in the course of the proposal was plainly foreseeable.  I do not
think it was too remote because the initial advertising
incurred the
displeasure of the TPC, and there was a reasonable resolution of the TPC's
complaint, what happened being amongst the
tribulations to be encountered in
the course of endeavouring to implement the proposal.  No allowance should be
made.  
<P>

1551	Of the potential $25,139,852, therefore, in my opinion a total allowance
of $3,946,024 should be made.  The recoverable loss
suffered by the NRMA for
Gambotto liability is $21,193,828.  Interest will run on the relevant
expenditure.  
<P>

<center><b>XII  THE RESULT</b></center>
<P>

1552	AAH, AT, and Mr Heydon are each liable in damages to the NRMA for
$21,193,828 plus interest.  As between themselves, the defendants
share this
amount equally.
<P>

1553	It will be necessary for interest to be calculated, and no doubt the
parties will wish to put submissions on costs.  
<P>

1554	The proceedings will be stood over for mention at 9.30 am on 3 June 1999.
No less than seven days prior to that date the NRMA
should provide to the other
parties its calculation of interest, and a statement of the order as to costs
it seeks together with
a brief outline of the reasons why that order should be
made.  No less than two days prior to that date the defendants should provide
to the NRMA a note of any disagreement with the calculation of interest and the
reasons for the disagreement, and a statement of
the order or orders as to
costs they seek together with a brief outline of the reasons why that order or
orders should be made. 
Directions will be given on 3 June 1999 so far as a
further hearing may be necessary to resolve disagreement in these areas, and
a
date for doing so will be appointed.
