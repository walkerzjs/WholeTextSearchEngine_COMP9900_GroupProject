<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> This is an appeal from a decision of Master Malpass given
on 5 November 1991.  Master Malpass made an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G(2)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> enlarging the time within which the Plaintiff might sue his
employer, the First Defendant, the Master Builders' Association of New
South
Wales ("the Master Builders' Association"), and the Second Defendant, Timalco
Glass Structures Pty Limited ("Timalco Glass").
 The action arose out of
injuries sustained by the Plaintiff on 25 October 1983.
<P>

2	The Notice of Appeal was lodged by the First Defendant on 5 January 1993, and
by the Second Defendant on 3 February 1993.  In
each case, therefore, the
notice was filed considerably outside the 28 day period fixed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p60" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 60</a> r 11(2)
of the Supreme Court Rules.  An extension of time is required by each appellant
before the merits of the appeal can be considered.
<P>

3	I have formed the view that, in each case, leave should be given to appeal.
It is convenient to postpone, for the moment, a statement
of my reasons.  They
will emerge in the description which I now give of the way in which the action
arose, and the manner in which
it progressed.
<P>

	<b>The Broad Chronology of Events</b>
<P>

4	The Plaintiff was born in 1956.  In 1982 he began an apprenticeship as a
carpenter with the Master Builders' Association.  He
completed that
apprenticeship in 1985.  He was, apparently, by arrangement, loaned by his
employer to Timalco Glass.  Whilst working
with that company, at a site at
Northbridge, he sustained an injury to his right wrist on 25 October 1983.  He
was operating a large
drill.  The drill was fitted with a masonry bit.  The
drill struck a piece of reinforcing steel, causing the drill bit to "grab".
The handle kept revolving, striking the Plaintiff's right wrist.  The matter
was reported.  A workers' compensation form was completed,
although the
Plaintiff remained at work.  He sought treatment from the St George Hospital,
and was referred to a specialist, Dr Benesik.
 He saw Dr Benesik over the next
several months, undertaking physiotherapy.  He was able to continue working.
<P>

5	In 1987 he became self employed.  It will be necessary, later in this
judgment, to examine closely the evolution of his symptoms
in the years
following the injury.
<P>

6	The limitation period expired on 24 October 1989.
<P>

7	On 27 August 1990, 10 months out of time, the Plaintiff filed a Statement of
Claim, against the First and Second Defendants. 
The Statement of Claim was
served upon each defendant.  However, only the First Defendant, the Master
Builders' Association, filed
an appearance and a defence.  The defence (filed
on 12 November 1990) asserted that the claim was out of time.
<P>

8	The Plaintiff's solicitors were slow to react.  On 25 June 1991, a Notice of
Motion was filed by those solicitors.  It identified
the First and Second
Defendants, following the format of the Statement of Claim.  The order it
sought, however, was that the time
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> in which the
Plaintiff might commence proceedings against the Defendant (singular) be
extended.  The return day for the Motion was
26 July 1991.  In an affidavit
subsequently filed on behalf of the Plaintiff, the following appeared:
<P>

	"On the 2nd July, 1991 a copy of the Notice of Motion was served on the second
Defendant.  Annexed hereto and marked with the letter
"B" is a copy of the
service of the Notice of Motion and Affidavit in support thereof."
<P>

9	However, the annexure was a letter addressed to the solicitor for the First
Defendant, the Master Builders' Association.  Whilst
the Plaintiff's solicitors
may have believed that the Second Defendant had been served with the Notice of
Motion, it was common ground
before me that the Second Defendant (Timalco
Glass) had not been served.
<P>

10	The matter ultimately proceeded before Master Malpass on 24 October 1991.
The transcript is headed "Gary Michael Steele v Master
Builders Association of
New South Wales &amp; Anor".  There was an appearance for the Plaintiff.  Mr
Meadley is recorded as having
"appeared for the defendant" (singular).
However, there is no reference to the Second Defendant having been called.
<P>

11	The Master reserved his decision, which he then gave on 5 November 1991.
The decision, when given, did not differentiate between
the defendants.
Indeed, it appears that the Master assumed, perhaps not unreasonably, that a
position was being put jointly on behalf
of both defendants.  He, for instance,
said this:  (p 5/6)
<P>

	"On behalf of the <b>defendant</b>, it is also said that if an order is made,
there will be substantial prejudice to the <b>defendants</b>.  I am unable to
accept this submission.  The <b>defendants</b> have not led any evidence of
prejudice that would be suffered by reason of delay."  (emphasis added)
<P>

12	He added:  (p 6)
<P>

	"I bear in mind that if the relief sought is granted, the <b>defendants</b>
will lose the benefit of the statutory defence.  Correspondingly, there will be
hardship to the plaintiff, if the order is not made."
 (emphasis added)
<P>

13	The order which was made, extending time, purported to apply to both
defendants.
<P>

14	On 29 November 1991, the First Defendant (the Master Builders' Association)
filed its own Motion.  It sought leave to extend
the time for filing a cross
claim against the Second Defendant (Timalco Glass).  The Motion was supported
by an affidavit.  The affidavit
drew attention to the fact that Timalco Glass
Structures was a company (Timalco Glass Structures Pty Limited), and included
the following
paragraph:
<P>

	"On 5th November, 1991 Master Malpass ordered that the limitation period for
the cause of action pleaded in the Statement of Claim
be extended for a period
up to and including 27th August, 1990 the date upon which the Statement of
Claim herein was filed."
<P>

15	The Motion was returnable on 10 December 1991, although stood over from that
date.  It was served upon Timalco Glass.  Service
of the First Defendant's
motion provoked a response at last from the Second Defendant.  An appearance
was filed on 12 December 1991,
as well as the Statement of Defence on behalf of
the Second Defendant.  The Statement of Defence raised the defence that the
claim
was Statute barred under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a>.
<P>

16	On 17 March 1992, the Plaintiff filed a notice to amend the name of the
Second Defendant to Timalco Glass Structures Pty Limited.
 Prothonotary Whalan
gave leave to make that amendment.  He also gave leave to the Master Builders'
Association to file a cross claim
against Timalco Glass.
<P>

17	On 5 January 1993, as mentioned, the Master Builders' Association lodged a
Notice of Appeal against the Master's decision of
5 November 1991.  The Notice
was supported by an affidavit by the solicitor for the First Defendant
identifying the basis upon which
the Court, in its discretion, should give
leave to extend the time for filing an appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p60" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 60</a> r 11(2) and
(4).  The affidavit essentially did two things.  First, it sought to explain
the delay between November 1991 (when the
Master gave his decision), and April
1992.  Secondly, it sought to explain several months additional delay (May 1992
to December
1992), occasioned by counsel being slow to provide advice which had
been sought.
<P>

18	The reason for the initial delay (November 1991 to April 1992) related to a
change in the law.  When the matter proceeded before
Master Malpass, it was
common ground that the Master was bound by a decision by McInerney J in
<b><i>Plumb v Electricity Commission of New South Wales</i></b> (unreported, 6
August 1991).  McInerney J, in that case, reached a particular view on the
construction of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.  The Electricity Commission of New South
Wales, however, appealed to the Court of Appeal against McInerney J's decision.
The Court
of Appeal gave its judgment on 28 April 1992, allowing the appeal.
<P>

19	Returning to the chronology, the appeal by the Second Defendant was lodged
on 3 February 1993.  It likewise sought to take advantage
of the overturning of
the authority which the Master had relied upon.  The two appeals came before
Campbell J on 19 March 1993. 
They were stood over generally with liberty to
restore on seven days notice.  It was noted on the court file that an appeal in
respect
of a similar issue was pending.  This was a reference to the matter of
<b><i>Dedousis v Water Board</i></b>.  The Court of Appeal gave judgment in
that matter on 20 August 1993.  Special leave was thereafter given by the High
Court.  The
High Court ultimately gave its decision on 16 November 1994
(<b><i>Dedousis v Water Board</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=125%20ALR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">125 ALR 193).</a>
<P>

20	On 28 November 1994 the solicitor for the First Defendant wrote to the
Supreme Court seeking to have the matter restored to the
list.  The matter was
restored, but there was no appearance for any party.  Either the Court omitted
to notify the parties, or the
notices were not received.  The First Defendant
again sought to have the matter restored (23 March 1995).  The matter came
before
Spender AJ on 3 April 1995.  The Plaintiff was required to file a Notice
of Contention (which was duly filed).  The parties were
given leave to approach
the List Judge, and to apply on two days notice.
<P>

21	Nothing happened thereafter for a number of years.  Neither appellant sought
to prosecute its appeal.  The Plaintiff took no
steps to complete the
pleadings, and have the matter set down for trial.
<P>

22	On 15 April 1998 the matter, by consent, was transferred to the District
Court.  It was then that the parties woke up.  On 10
September 1998, the
solicitors for the Second Defendant (Timalco Glass) sought to have the appeal
restored to the list.  On 17 September
1998, the solicitor for the Master
Builders' Association likewise sought to have the appeal determined.
<P>

	<b>The Change in the Law</b>
<P>

23	The application by Mr Steele, the Plaintiff, was brought, relevantly, under
Subdivision 3 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act, 1969</a>.  Subdivision 3 is headed,
"Discretionary extension for latent injury etc.".  That subdivision begins with
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60F</a>, which identifies the purpose of the subdivision in these terms:
<P>

	"60F.	The purpose of this Subdivision is to provide a procedure for a further
discretionary extension of limitation periods where
the plaintiff was unaware
of the fact, nature, extent or cause of the injury, disease or impairment at
the relevant time.  This procedure
is available for causes of action accruing
on or after 1 September 1990, and also (by the operation of Schedule 5) for
causes of
action that accrued before that date."
<P>

24	Mr Steele's cause of action accrued before 1 September 1990, namely on 25
October 1983.  By cl 4(1) of Schedule 5, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> applied to such a cause of
action.  Clause 4(4) defined the power of the Court to make an order under that
section as follows:
<P>

	"Cl.4(4)	The court may make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60G</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">60H</a>, in relation to
a cause of action referred to in this clause, within:
<P>

	(a)	the period of 3 years referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60</a> <b>I</b>; or
<P>

	(b)	the period of 3 years commencing on 1 September 1990."
<P>

25	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60G(2)</a> is in these terms:
<P>

	"60G(2)	If an application for an order under this section is made to a court
by a person claiming to have a cause of action to
which this section applies,
the court, after hearing such of the persons likely to be affected by the
application as it sees fit,
may, if it decides that it is just and reasonable
to do so, order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended
for such period as it determines."
<P>

26	Finally, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b> identifies the matters to be considered by the Court
when making an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G.</a>  It says this:
<P>

	"60 <b>I</b>(1)	A court may not make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60G</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">60H</a> unless
it is satisfied that:
<P>

	(a)	the plaintiff:
<P>

	(i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or
<P>

	(ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;  or
<P>

	(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,
<P>

	at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have
been instituted;  and
<P>

	(b)	the application is made within 3 years after the plaintiff became aware
(or ought to have become aware of all 3 matters listed
in paragraph (a)
(i)-(iii)).
<P>

	(2)	Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60E</a> apply, with any necessary
adaptations, in relation to applications for orders under this Subdivision."
<P>

27	These provisions were considered in a number of decisions before and after
the decision by Master Malpass in this case on 5 November
1991.  On 22 November
1990, the Court of Appeal (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Meagher JA) decided
<b><i>James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Limited v Wootton </i></b>((1990)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=20%20NSWLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">20 NSWLR
713).</a>  The plaintiff suffered from asbestosis.  He wished to commence an action
for damages, he having not appreciated that he may contract
mesothelioma.  The
Court was plainly dealing, therefore, with a latent injury.  It was common
ground that the Plaintiff could not
satisfy the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>.
However, Gleeson J said this:  (at  717)
<P>

	"Nowhere does it say that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b> has general application, although of
course in its practical operation cl 4(4)(a) requires attention to be paid to
the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>."
<P>

28	The Chief Justice added:  (at 717)
<P>

	"I see no justification for importing into the operation of cl 4(4)(b) the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>."
<P>

29	The other members of the Court agreed.
<P>

30	Thereafter, McInerney J held in <b><i>Plumb v Electricity Commission of New
South Wales</i></b> on 6 August 1991, that cl 4(4)(b) applied to all injuries,
whether latent or otherwise.
<P>

31	Two principles, therefore, had been established by the time the matter came
before Master Malpass in October 1991:
<P>

&#183;	The first, that in respect of a cause of action accruing before 1
September 1990 (cl 4(1)), and in the period defined by
cl 4(4)(b) (ie between 1
September 1990 and 1 September 1993), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b> need not be satisfied.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, in such an application, it did not matter that the injury was
patent rather than latent, as defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60F.</a>
<P>

32	In his judgment in the present matter, Master Malpass set out the provisions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> which he considered relevant.  They did not include
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>.  Master Malpass appeared not to regard the injury to Mr Steele
as being a latent injury, but, following McInerney J in <b><i>Plumb v
Electricity Commission</i></b>, that was not a barrier to success.
<P>

33	In April 1992 the Court of Appeal (Mahony, Handley and Sheller JJA) gave
judgment in <b><i>Electricity Commission of New South Wales v Plumb</i></b>
((1992)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=27%20NSWLR%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">27 NSWLR 364).</a>  The appeal against the decision of McInerney J was
allowed.  Clause 4(4)(b) of Schedule 5 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> applied only
to latent injuries, as defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60F.</a>
<P>

34	In November 1994, the High Court (Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh
JJ) gave judgment in <b><i>Dedousis v Water Board</i></b> (125 ALR 193).
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60f.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60F</a> was not given the prominence it was accorded in
<b><i>Plumb</i></b>.  The Court said this:  (at 197)
<P>

	"In our opinion, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60F</a> is no more than an introductory provision that
indicates the purpose of Sub-Div 3.  It provides a summary of the effect of the
substantive
provisions of the Sub-Division."
<P>

35	There was no warrant, therefore, for distinguishing between latent and
patent injuries in cl 4(4).  Rather, the position was
as follows:  (at 199)
<P>

	"The result is that the plaintiff must satisfy the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a>
<b>I</b>(1)(a) and then satisfy the court that his application for an extension
was brought within the time limit specified in either cl 4(4)(a)
or cl 4(4)(b).
This approach is in accordance with the language of the Act."
<P>

36	The Court added:  (at 199)
<P>

	"Thus the legislature appears to have intended that the plaintiff must have
been unaware of at least one of the matters referred
to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>(1)(a)
before an extension could be granted, no matter when the plaintiff's cause of
action accrued."
<P>

37	In that case (as in the case of Mr Steele), the plaintiff's cause of action
had accrued before 1 September 1990.  The application
for an extension had been
made within the period defined by cl 4(4)(b), as it had in the case of Mr
Steele.  The following comment
by the Court, therefore, has application to Mr
Steele.  The Court said this:  (at 200)
<P>

	"Because the plaintiff's action falls within cl 4(1), he is entitled to seek
an exercise of the court's discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G(2)</a> to extend the relevant
limitation period.  Further, because the plaintiff's application falls within
cl 4(4)(b), he is taken to have
met the time requirement laid down in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a>
<b>I</b>(1)(b).  However, the plaintiff is not entitled to any order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60G</a> unless the court is satisfied that he was unaware of at least one of the
matters referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>(1)(a)."
<P>

38	It is clear that the appeals by the defendants in this case were provoked by
the reversal of McInerney J in <b><i>Electricity Commission of New South Wales
v Plumb</i></b>.  The Court of Appeal was itself then overruled by the High
Court in <b><i>Dedousis v Water Board</i></b>.  However, the law, as it emerged
in <b><i>Dedousis</i></b>, was very different from the law as it was assumed to
be at the time Master Malpass heard the appeal.  There was a requirement that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60</a> <b>I</b> be satisfied.  In the circumstances, and notwithstanding the delay
between May 1992 and January 1993, I believe it is appropriate
to give leave to
appeal to each defendant.
<P>

39	I should mention that the decision by the Master was interlocutory in nature
(<b><i>Forbes v Lindop</i></b> (C of A (Kirby ACJ, Clarke, Sheller JJA),
unreported, 17 July 1995):  <b><i>SRA v Gaudron</i></b> (C of A (Priestley,
Meagher JJA, Brownie AJA), unreported, 12 August 1997)).  The action had not
been concluded by verdict or judgment
(cf <b><i>Piening v Wanless</i></b>
([1967-1968] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1968/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=117%20CLR%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">117 CLR 498):</a>  <b><i>R v Unger</i></b> ([1977] 2 NSWJ 990):
<b><i>Eggins v Brooms Head Bowling and Recreational Club Ltd</i></b> ((1984)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=5%20NSWLR%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">5
NSWLR 521)).</a>  It was not inappropriate that the limitation issue should be
revisited in the light of the law as it has emerged.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	The Appeal by the Second Defendant</b>
<P>

40	The Second Defendant is in a rather different position from the First
Defendant.  When the matter was first mentioned before
me, as the Duty Judge,
on Monday 23 November 1998, the Second Defendant sought to file in court an
Amended Notice of Appeal.  There
was no debate.  The document was simply handed
up.  It was placed with the Court papers.  The Plaintiff was represented by a
solicitor.
 The amendment sought to add that the Second Defendant had not been
served with the Notice of Motion of 25 July 1991 (by which the
Plaintiff sought
an enlargement of the limitation period).  It was argued that, since <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p19" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 19</a> r 4
required personal service in circumstances where an appearance has not been
filed, the Master's order should not be construed
as applying otherwise than to
the First Defendant.  Alternatively, if, on its proper construction, the order
of the Master purported
to bind both defendants, the Master's judgment is, in
respect of the Second Defendant, irregular, in terms of s 81(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act 1970</a>.  It should be set aside.
<P>

41	The Second Defendant drew attention to the following statements in Ritchie,
in the notes that accompany s 81 (p1147):
<P>

	"For example, it is well established that a defendant who has not been served
with the originating process, or one who has not
been given notice of the
hearing, is entitled to have a judgment against him set aside under the court's
inherent jurisdiction: 
<i>Craig v Kanssen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1943%5d%201%20KB%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1943] 1 KB 256</a>;  <i>White v

<P>

42	I believe the Master's order of 5 November 1991 should be construed as
having been made against both the First and Second Defendants.
<P>

43	It is, as mentioned, common ground that the Second Defendant was not served
with a Notice of Motion, although I accept that it
was served with the
Statement of Claim, which it chose to ignore.  In respect of the present
appeal, no affidavit was filed on behalf
of the Second Defendant.  It was said
from the bar table, and repeated in written submissions (26 November 1998),
that the Second
Defendant (through its solicitors) first received actual notice
of Master Malpass' order in January 1993 when it was served with
a copy of the
affidavit of the solicitor for the First Defendant which accompanied the Notice
of Appeal.  The statement by counsel
from the bar table is not evidence.  Nor
is the written submission.  The matter was not conceded by the Plaintiff.  The
Second Defendant
was, however, served with the earlier affidavit of the First
Defendant's solicitor, dated 29 November 1991.  That affidavit, in the
passage
extracted above (supra p 4), specifically referred to the decision of Master
Malpass.  I infer, as a matter of probability,
that the Second Defendant knew
of Master Malpass' order soon after it was made.  It had the means of
determining whether that order
had been made irregularly.  As a matter of
probability, it either determined that issue, or regarded it as unimportant to
do so.
 Had it moved immediately to set aside the judgment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 40</a> r 9, the
Plaintiff could have issued a fresh application which would still have been
within the time fixed by Schedule 5 cl 4(4)(b)
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a>.
Even had the Second Defendant moved with reasonable dispatch after January
1993, when it claimed that it first became aware of the
judgment of Master
Malpass, it should have emerged before September 1993 when the period
identified by cl 4(4)(b) expired.  However,
the Second Defendant did not do so.
I do not believe, in these circumstances, that, in determining an appeal from
the Master's decision,
I should deal with the issue as though I were dealing
with an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 40</a> r 9.  I am, however, prepared to regard the
irregularity in failing to serve the Notice of Motion as a further reason why
leave to
appeal should be given to the Second Defendant.  Having regard to the
changes in the law to which I have referred, and the irregularity
in respect of
service, and notwithstanding the delay, I believe that it is appropriate to
give the Second Defendant leave to appeal
against the decision of Master
Malpass.  Were I to determine that appeal against them, it would no doubt still
be open to the Second
Defendant to bring an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 40</a> r 9.
<P>

	<b>The Merits of the Appeal</b>
<P>

44	The parties have agreed that, in the event of my giving leave to appeal to
either defendant (as I now have), I should myself
determine the merits of the
application upon the basis of the material which was before the Master.
However, it is not altogether
satisfactory to do so.  When the matter proceeded
before Master Malpass, for the reasons explained, it was not regarded as
relevant
to satisfy the separate limbs of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>.  Questions, therefore,
were not directed to the precise issues arising under that section.  The
Plaintiff sworn an affidavit.  He
also saw a number of doctors.  He recounted a
history of his disabilities.  He was cross examined before Master Malpass.  The
cross
examination was obviously based upon the affidavit and the medical
reports.  However, the apparent conflict between certain aspects
of the
Plaintiff's evidence, and either his affidavit or the history given to various
doctors, was not specifically brought to his
attention.  The task of
determining the true position, as a matter of probability, in these
circumstances, is, therefore, not easy.
<P>

45	Directing my attention to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b>I</b>(1)(a), it is plain that the
Plaintiff was aware that he had suffered personal injury <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 60</a>
<b>I</b>(1)(a)(i)).  Was he unaware of the nature and extent of the personal
injury as at 24 October 1989, when the limitation period expired,
or at a time
before that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 60</a> <b>I</b>(a)(1)(ii))?  The High Court has determined, <b><i>Harris v
Commercial Minerals Limited &amp; Ors</i></b> ([1995-96] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">186 CLR 1</a> at 12) that
the "extent" of the injury is to be determined as at the date of the
application (October 1991), and not the expiration
of the limitation or earlier
period.
<P>

46	The Plaintiff described in his affidavit the growth of symptoms over time.
The injury was to the wrist.  He had conservative
treatment (physiotherapy).
He was led to believe that the condition would resolve.  However, he developed
pain in his forearm.  He
fixed the time of onset of such pain as being two or
three years after the accident (affidavit p 2(10)), or "about a year or so
after
the accident" (Dr Greenwell, report 11.1.91 p 2).  When cross examined,
Mr Steele thought that the forearm pain first began "a number
of years" after
the accident (T 4).  This was plainly something known to him well before the
limitation period expired in 1989. 
Mr Steele, in his affidavit, said this:  (p
3)
<P>

	"13.	By the end of 1989 and early 1990 I had become self-employed as a
Carpenter and I had found that I was now dropping things
such as hammers when
using my right hand, I was having difficulties in picking up heavy objects
using my right arm and/or wrist,
I was having problems drilling with my right
hand, and I was having difficulties in social pursuits such as squash and
fishing.
<P>

	14.	Due to the difficulties that I was experiencing at the end of 1989 and
early 1990 it became necessary for myself and my partners
to assign various
work between us having regard to a weakness and pain that I was experiencing in
my right wrist.
<P>

	15.	As a result of the ongoing difficulties I was having I consulted a Dr De
Sousa who advised me on 3 August 1990 to wear a splint
or brace however I found
this to be of no assistance at all."
<P>

47	Mr Steele amended his affidavit before giving evidence.  He had been
mistaken in respect of the time he became self employed.
 The words "in
approximately 1987" were substituted for the dates appearing in paragraph 13
above (T 1).  Mr Steele, when cross examined,
confirmed that the problems
became worse when he established his own business in approximately 1987.
Again, this was a matter known
to him before the expiration of the limitation
period.
<P>

48	There was no report from Dr De Sousa.  However, there was an x-ray report
which was obtained at his request, and which is dated
2 August 1990.
<P>

49	However, there was a further symptom.  The Plaintiff developed pain in the
right shoulder.  There is some uncertainty as to when
this pain developed,
although it is clear that its onset was more recent.  The Plaintiff told Dr
Greenwell that his symptoms were
identified as being possibly associated with
the wrist injury by Dr Ong (T 7).  He did not state when that diagnosis was
postulated.
 Dr Greenwell, writing in January 1991, recorded a history from the
Plaintiff that "his shoulder symptoms have been apparent over
the past two
years" (exhibit 1, p 2).  If that were accurate, the symptoms would first have
manifested in approximately January 1989,
which is before the expiration of the
limitation period.
<P>

50	The evidence as to the association between the shoulder symptoms and the
injury is spare.  There is no medical evidence from
the Plaintiff on this
aspect.  Dr Greenwell (for the defendant) thought that the shoulder symptoms
were unrelated to the accident.
 The Plaintiff, himself, said this:  (T 4)
<P>

	"Q.	You also indicated to Dr Greenwell that you developed some shoulder
symptoms?
<P>

	A.	Yes.  I didn't say that they were related to it.  I am saying that I had
trouble with my shoulders."
<P>

51	On the evidence, therefore, the symptoms in the right wrist, right forearm,
and even the right shoulder, had manifested themselves
before the expiration of
the limitation period (that is, before 25 October 1989).  Accordingly, I am not
satisfied that, in terms
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60</a> <b>I</b>(1)(a)(ii), that the plaintiff was
unaware of the nature and extent of the personal injuries before that date.
The symptoms certainly
became worse with time.  However, the trigger for that
deterioration appears to have been the plaintiff becoming self employed. 
That
occurred in 1987, well before the expiration of the limitation period (25
October 1989).
<P>

52	One then comes to the final sub-paragraph of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60</a> <b>I</b>(1)(a)(iii):  can
it be said that the plaintiff was unaware of the connection between the
personal injury and the defendants acts
or omissions?  The plaintiff, from the
outset, clearly appreciated the connection between the wrist symptoms and the
accident.  The
forearm symptoms developed soon after.  It is apparent that the
plaintiff associated those symptoms with the accident, as did Dr
Ong.  The
shoulder symptoms, in the plaintiff's mind, may or may not have been connected.
The plaintiff appreciated the possible
association between the accident and the
shoulder symptoms, although he remained uncertain.  There is no medical
evidence before
me that connects those symptoms with the accident.  Indeed, as
mentioned, the only medical report which addressed that issue was
that of Dr
Greenwell, for the defendants, who believed that there was no relationship
between the accident and the shoulder symptoms.
 Since the shoulder symptoms,
in any event, arose before the expiration of the limitation period, it is
likely that the plaintiff's
appreciation of the possible connection between the
accident and those symptoms was itself prior to the expiration of the
limitation
period.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff was
unaware of the connection between the personal injuries he suffered,
and the
defendants' acts or omissions.
<P>

53	The plaintiff, therefore, has not proved, as a matter of probability, that
he was unaware of at least one of the matters referred
to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a>
<b>I</b>(1)(a).  Since this is a preliminary requirement to success under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60G(2)</a> it is unnecessary for me to deal with the issues which arise under that
section.  I therefore allow the appeal.
<P>

54	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I give leave to appeal to the First Defendant and the Second Defendant
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p60" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 60</a> r 11(4).
<P>

2.	The appeal by the First and Second Defendants against the order of Master
Malpass made on 5 November 1991 is, in each case, 
allowed.
<P>

3.	The application by the Plaintiff for an extension of time under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G(2)</a>
against the First and Second Defendants is, in each case, refused.
<P>

4.	The Plaintiff should pay the costs of the First and Second Defendants, but
should have an Indemnity Certificate under the Suitor's
Fund Act.
