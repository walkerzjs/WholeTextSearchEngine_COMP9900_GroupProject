<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Summary judgment;  </b>
<P>

<b>strike out statement of claim;</b>
<P>

<b>				termination of employment)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 4 June 1999 the
defendant seeks that the amended statement of claim be struck out pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> r 5 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules (SCR)</b> or alternatively that
paragraphs 5 to 12 inclusive of the amended statement of claim be struck out.
The defendant relied on the affidavits
of Geoff Boyd sworn 17 June 1999 and
Michael Frederick Sands sworn 6 May 1998.  
<P>

2  	Part 13 r 5 of the <b>SCR</b> refers to summary judgment.  It
states:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to
the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for
relief in the
proceedings -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious;</b>
<P>

<b>	or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or
in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings."</b>
<P>

3  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to
remind himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway
Commissioners</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%2d49%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948-49) 78 CLR 62</a>, <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways</u> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> and <b><u>Webster &amp;
Anor v Lampard</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  I have reproduced some of the
passages quoted.
<P>

4  	In <b><u>General Steel</u></b> Barwick CJ, who heard the
application alone, referred to Dixon J's passage quoted above at p 130.  He
then stated:
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

5  	Barwick CJ also said:
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense."</b>
<P>

6  	More recently in <b><u>Webster</u></b> Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson
JJ reinforced the rigorous testing stating, at p 602:
<P>

<b>"The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with `exceptional
caution' and `should never be exercised unless it is clear
that there is no
real question to be tried."'</b>
<P>

7  	According to Rolfe AJA in <b><u>Zarb:</u></b>
<P>

<b>"The demanding nature of the test is in no way lessened in circumstances
where there are the potential for difficult factual and legal
issues to arise.
Rather, as the decision in Webster made clear, it is heightened:  see also
Wickstead &amp; Ors v Browne  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1</a> and Esanda Finance Corporation
Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241."</a></b>
<P>

8  	The following facts are not in dispute.
<P>

(1)	On 6 March 1991 the defendant's Office of the Director of Public
Prosecutions forwarded to the plaintiff and offer of appointment
as Principal
Solicitor Grade V.  On 11 March 1991 the plaintiff accepted that offer.
<P>

(2)	With the advice of the Executive Council, pursuant to the provisions of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Sector Management Act</a> </b>1988 and upon the recommendation of the
Director of Public Prosecutions, the Governor approved the appointment on
probation of the
plaintiff.
<P>

(3)	On 4 July 1991 the plaintiff was given notice of certain allegations made
against him by Ms Helen Barbalich and others in relation
to his conduct and
work performance and proposing that a disciplinary interview be conducted with
him the next day.
<P>

(4)	On 5 July 1991 the plaintiff was suspended, pending a resolution of
disciplinary matters affecting him.
<P>

(5)	On 11 July 1991 the plaintiff, by letter, resigned as a solicitor with the
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with
immediate effect.  His
resignation was accepted.
<P>

9  	The plaintiff alleges that there were two relevant terms of the
contract between the plaintiff and defendant namely those set
out in paragraphs
5 and 9 of the amended statement of claim.  They are:
<P>

<b>"5.	It was an implied term of the contract of employment between the
Plaintiff and Defendant ("the contract") that the Defendant,
through its
servants and agents, would not without reasonable cause, conduct itself in a
manner likely to damage or destroy the relationship
of confidence and trust
between the parties as employer and employee."</b>
<P>

10  	The defendant agrees that the above term is generally an implied
term in a contract of employment.
<P>

<b>"9.	It was a term of the contract that the Defendant would conduct any
disciplinary proceedings against the Plaintiff in accordance
with the
provisions of the Public Sector Management Act, 1998, the Public <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_reg/sr259/" class="autolink_findacts">Sector
(General) Regulations</a> made pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Sector Management Act, 1988</a>
and the Guidelines for Disciplinary action promulgated by the
Attorney-General's Department."</b>
<P>

11  	It is alleged in paragraphs 10 of the amended statement of claim
that:
<P>

<b>"10.	On 5 July 1991, the Defendant, by its employee Mr John Favoretto
wrongfully and in breach of the terms of the contract set out
in the paragraphs
5 and 9 failed to conduct a disciplinary proceeding against the Plaintiff in
accordance with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Sector Management Act, 1988</a>, the Public Sector
Management (General) Regulations and the Guidelines for Disciplinary Action
promulgated by the Attorney-General's
Department."</b>
<P>

12  	and in paragraph 12 that:
<P>

<b>"12.	On or about 11 July, 1991, the Defendant, by its employee Reg Blanch QC
wrongfully and in breach of the contract terminated and
wrongfully
constructively dismissed the Plaintiff and refused to employ him any
longer."</b>
<P>

13  	The plaintiff alleges that he has suffered injury and claims
damages which include wage loss, injury to reputation and diminution
of
capacity to obtain employment in the legal profession.
<P>

14  	The defendant submitted that whether the plaintiff had a
contract of employment does not matter because there is a statutory
regime in
place that governs the plaintiff's terms of employment and this statutory
regime abrogates the common law.  According to
the defendant part of the
statutory regime is that if the plaintiff wishes to pursue legal proceedings
that his employment had been
wrongly terminated, those proceedings should have
been taken in the Industrial Relations Court.
<P>

15  	The plaintiff was appointed to his position in accordance with s
28 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Service Management Act</a></b> 1988 (NSW) (PSMA) in that he as
an officer of the Public Service was appointed to that position on probation
for a period of 6 months.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 29(1)</a> of the <b>PSMA</b> provides that after
a period of 6 months, the Governor may on the recommendation of the Department
Head based on inquiry and report
may either confirm the appointment after the
period of appointment or annul the appointment during or after the period of
appointment.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 29(3)</a> states that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75</a> does not prevent the Governor from
exercising at any time the power to annul the appointment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 29(1).</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 75</a> refers to punishment of officers for breaches of discipline.  Thus
the plaintiff was appointed on probation for a period of 6 months.
He resigned
within that probationary period.
<P>

16  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 54</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">55</a> of the <b>PSMA</b> provide:
<P>

<b>"54.	Right of the Crown to dispense with an officer's services not affected
by the Act (1979 Act, s 118)</b>
<P>

<b>The right or power of the Crown to dispense with the services of any person
employed in the Public Service, as it existed immediately
before the
commencement of this section, is not abrogated or restricted by any of the
provisions of this Act.</b>
<P>

<b>55.	No compensation to be paid where officer's services dispensed with or
salary reduced  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1979%20Act%202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979 Act, 2</a> 119)</b>
<P>

<b>An officer or temporary employee is not, except as provided by this or any
other Act, entitled to any compensation as a result of
the officer's services
being dispensed with or the officer's salary being reduced."</b>
<P>

17  	The position at common law prior to the commencement of the
<b>PSMA</b> and its predecessors was that unless in special cases where it is
otherwise provided, either expressly or by implication, those who
serve in such
a capacity hold their offices at the pleasure of the Crown:  <b><u>Shenton v
Smith</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1895%20AC%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1895 AC 229</a> at pp 234, 235.  The general rule of the common law
is that the King may refuse the services of any officer of the Crown and
suspend
or dismiss him from his office <b><u>Fletcher v Nott</u></b> (1938) 60
CLR at 77.  Except under an act of Parliament, no one acting on behalf of the
Crown has authority to employ any person
except upon the terms that he is
dismissible at the Crown's pleasure:  <b><u>Kaye v Attorney General For
Tasmania</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%2d1956%29%2094%20CLR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955-1956) 94 CLR 193</a> at 198.  McHugh JA (as he then was) in
<b><u>Suttling v Director-General of Education</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 427</a> at
447 stated that generally the employment of a Crown servant may be terminated
at any time at the pleasure of the Crown.  He stated
that this was an implied
term of the ordinary contract of Crown employment but acknowledged that this
general rule may be abrogated
by the express terms of the contractor by
statute.  It is my view that s 54 recognises the continued existence of a right
to dismiss
at pleasure.  That right has not been varied either by statute or by
contract.
<P>

18  	According to the plaintiff, s 24 in Part 8 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial
Relations Act</a></b> 1991 provides:

<b>"Application of Part</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	This Part applies only to the dismissal or threatened dismissal
of:</b>

<b>(a)	an employee for whom any conditions of employment are fixed by an award

<P>

<b>(b)	an employee of the Crown;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	any other employee of a class prescribed by the regulations as a class
of persons to whom this Part applies.</b>
<P>

<P>

19  	and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s246.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 246(1)</a> and (2) provide:

<b>"Application</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	If an employer dismisses, or threatens to dismiss, a person who is an

of employees on behalf of the person) may apply
to the Commission for the claim to be dealt with under this Part.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Any such application should be lodged with the Industrial Registrar not
later than 21 days after, or (in the case of a threat

<P>

20  	These sections are almost identical to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s83.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 83</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s84.html" class="autolink_findacts">84</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b> 1996.
<P>

21  	According to the defendant, under the statutory regime in place
during the plaintiff's period of employment the defendant had
the right to
dispense with the plaintiff's services at will and the plaintiff is not
entitled to any compensation except that provided
in the <b>PSMA</b> and the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b> 1991.  The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b> 1991
has been superseded by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b> 1996 but it is
common ground that the plaintiff's case is covered by the 1991 legislation.
According to the defendant, the only statutory
right to compensation is that
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s245.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 245</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s246.html" class="autolink_findacts">246</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b> 1991. 
<P>

<u>22  	</u>Both parties referred to the High Court decision of
<b><u>Suttling v Director-General of Education</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%2d87%29%20162%20CLR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986-87) 162 CLR 427.</a>
In <b><u>Suttling</u></b> a teacher applied for a temporary position by the
Director-General of Education (NSW) and was appointed on secondment for a fixed
term at a higher salary than he then received.  During the term, the
establishment to which he was seconded was closed.  No alternative
position at
an equivalent salary being available, he accepted one at a lower salary and
sought to recover from the Director-General
the difference between those
salaries with interest.  At p 437 Brennan J (with whom Deane J and Mason ACJ
agreed) held that:
<P>

<b>"Members of the [Public] Service are appointed pursuant to the Act and their
rights must be ascertained by reference to its provisions.
 The relationship
between a civil servant of the Crown and the Crown has often been described as
contractual, though the civil servant

relationship has not been universally accepted:  see e.g., <i>Monckton v The
Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1920] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2027%20CLR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 27 CLR 149</a> at pp 155, 156;  <i>Lucy v The
Commonwealth</i> (1923) 33 CLR at 244;  <i>Geddes v Magrath</i>;  <i>Morgan v
Geddes</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2050%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 50 CLR 520</a> at pp 533-534;  <i>The Commonwealth v Welsh</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1947/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2074%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 74 CLR 245</a> at pp 262, 274 and <i>Ryder v Foley</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%204%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 4 CLR 422</a> at
440.  And sometimes an espousal of one view rather than the other has been
avoided:  see e.g., <i>Reilly v The King</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1934%5d%20AC%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1934] AC 176</a> at 180;
<i>Kodeeswaran v Attorney-General (Ceylon)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%201111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] AC 1111</a> at 1118.  If the
relationship is contractual, the contract must be consistent with any statutory
provision which affects the relationship.
 No agent of the Crown has authority
to engage a servant on terms of variance with the statute.  To the extent that
the statute governs
the relationship, it is idle to inquire whether there is a
contract which embodies its provisions.  The statute itself controls the
terms
of service:  <i>McVicar v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2083%20CLR%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 83 CLR 521</a>
at 527."</b>
<P>

23  	Many of the plaintiff's submissions were concerned with the
contractual nature of the relationship between employer and the
employee but
this does not seem to be the point.  As Brennan J says in
<b><u>Suttling</u></b> to the extent which the statute governs the relationship
there is no utility in pursuing the enquiry whether there is a contract
that
embodies its provision.
<P>

24  	In relation to the statutory provisions, the plaintiff submitted
that as he resigned his services were not "dispensed with"
so s 55 of the
<b>PSMA</b> does not apply.  Further he argued that the word "compensation"
does not includes damages in s 55.  The words of the statute should
be given
their ordinary and natural meaning.  Those words should not be given a narrower
interpretation and read down.  It is my
view that this argument is hopeless.
<P>

25  	It is my view that s 55 of the <b>PSMA</b> disentitles the
plaintiff to claim compensation except as provided by that Act or any other
Act.  The plaintiff has not pleaded his
case under section of <b>PSMA</b>.  The
other Act that gives the plaintiff an entitlement is the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial
Relations Act</a></b> 1991.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s246.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 246(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b>
directs those claims to be made to the Industrial Registrar.  There are
statutory provisions which govern the plaintiff's rights
to take proceedings
for wrongful dismissal.  The amended statement of claim which pleads breach of
contract is doomed to failure
and should be dismissed.  The plaintiff has
already been given an opportunity to reformulate his claim.  In the exercise of
my discretion,
as I do not think that a further opportunity to amended would
overcome the deficiencies in the plaintiff's claim, I dismiss the amended
statement of claim.  Costs should follow the event.  The plaintiff is to pay
the defendant's costs.
<P>

26  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The amended statement of claim is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.
