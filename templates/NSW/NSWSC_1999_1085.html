<P>

Friday 5 November 1999
<P>

<b><u>70105/92  -   REGINA   v  BRIAN WILLIAM MAXWELL</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b> The accused was indicted before me on
a count of murder to which he pleaded not guilty but guilty of manslaughter.
The Crown Prosecutor
declined to accept that plea in discharge of the
indictment and the trial proceeded.  Some background facts should be recorded
and
some comments made.  
<P>

2   	On 24 August 1992 Marilyn Maxwell, the estranged wife of
the accused, died as a result of blood loss following a bullet wound.
 The
projectile was discharged from a .22 sawn off rifle being brandished by the
accused.  That much is not in dispute.  The curial
history until March 1996 is
traced in the various judgments of the High Court published in 184 CLR p501 and
following.  I have read
those judgments but for the purposes of present trial I
ignore the factual content, in particular the reported views of Dr Shand
and
the concession concerning the intention of the accused.  As to the latter see
per Gaudron and Gummow JJ @ 527. 
<P>

3   	Upon the matter being remitted from the High Court, a
previous election on behalf of the Crown to accept a plea of guilty to
manslaughter in discharge of the indictment was withdrawn and the indictment
was tried by Bruce J sitting without a jury.  A conviction
for murder following
that trial was set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal in a judgment
delivered on 23 December 1998.  I have
read that judgment.
<P>

4   	I confirm my information to counsel that, save the
abovementioned and material which has been tendered before me I do not believe
that I have accessed extraneous material and in particular I have not read the
judgment of Bruce J.  
<P>

5   	As indicated, the hearing proceeded before me without a
jury pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s32</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act 1986</a>.  The parties waived
the rules of evidence pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  In the
result, a substantial part of the trial was conducted by  tender of statements
by witnesses accompanied by transcripts of
testimony given before Bruce J.  A
transcript of the unsworn statement of the accused at that trial was tendered.
This was supplemented
by his utterance, again unsworn, of the following four
sentences:
<P>

"Your Honour, I would like to tell the Court what happened.  My problem is that
it is very difficult for me.  I can't seem to say
what I want to say and I get
confused; even more confused now than I was at the last trial and I did my best
at the last trial. 
It is very painful for me and I just don't think I could do
it again."             
<P>

6   	Exceptions were two witnesses who spoke briefly of their
acquaintance with and observations of the accused.  One of these Raymond
Clamback had been overseas at the time of the previous trial and an affidavit
by him was received then and re-tendered in this trial.
 The other exceptions
were four psychiatrists, Drs Strum, Jurek, Westmore and Milton whose reports
and evidence at the earlier trial
were supplemented, in some cases by further
reports, and in all cases by testimony.
<P>

7   	It is a disturbing observation that an accused citizen is
potentially liable to the maximum available penalty known to our
law upon
judicial decision without any contribution to the finding of guilt by a jury of
his peers and after a trial significantly
conducted "on paper".  I strongly
urge the legislature to consider exempting crimes of the magnitude of murder
from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s32</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act</a> or at least restoring to the courts a
power to insist upon trial by jury irrespective of any concert between an
accused and the Director
of Public Prosecutions avoiding it.  I suggest that an
observation of the course of this trial would provide enlightenment to those
theorists who propose that trial without jury is somehow more expeditious.  I
do not imagine any competent counsel on either side
of litigation would engage
in examination of psychiatric and psychological hypotheses before a jury to the
extravagant degree undertaken
in this hearing.
<P>

8   	To establish the offence of murder the Crown must prove
beyond reasonable doubt that an act of the accused caused the death
of Marilyn
Maxwell, that the act was deliberate and done with an intention to kill or
cause grievous bodily harm.  In these respects
the central issue of dispute
raised on behalf of the accused was his intent or the lack of it.  
<P>

9   	The routine of the victim was to deliver Guy, the son of
herself and the accused to the William Lawson Day Care Centre, Prospect.
 There
was in force an order made in the Local Court restraining the accused from
being within five hundred metres of that establishment.
<P>

10   	The accused came to the vicinity in a Ford Marquis vehicle
which he had purchased on the previous Friday.  24th August was
a Monday.  He
was dressed in work clothes of his current employer Petrolink but covered these
with a hooded yellow raincoat.  He
brought with him the sawn off rifle wrapped
in a towel.  He positioned himself at the rear of his wife's car while she was
inside
the premises delivering Guy.
<P>

11   	Upon her return he confronted her with the weapon.  Three
shots were discharged.  One projectile twice passed through fleshy
parts of the
victim's arm and grazed her breast, another missed her completely and a third
entered her face with fatal consequence.
 Investigation has not established the
order in which these three shots were fired.  The accused acquired the keys to
his wife's
car and drove from a parking bay towards the public street in an
erratic manner.  Ultimately following a collision with a post he
exited from
the car but his departure was prevented by a motorist who used his vehicle to
pinion him.   The activity of the accused
had not gone unnoticed.  He was in
due course taken into custody and placed in a police van which had been
directed to the scene.
<P>

12   	At an interview conducted that morning which was recorded
on video and audiotape, the accused on occasions described to police
how the
victim had "grabbed" the gun, the suggestion being that this action caused the
discharge.  There is no doubt that the act
of the accused in presenting the
weapon which fired the projectile caused the death.  The issues are whether his
act was deliberate
and what was his intention.  I find a path to resolution of
these issues can be achieved by answering the question: Is there any
credit at
all to be attached to the claim of the accused that the deceased grabbed the
weapon.  The claim was made to police soon
after arrest.  
<P>

13   	I interpolate at this stage that the accused raised his
prior good character.  He is entitled to have this taken into account
both on
the likelihood of his committing the crime and upon his credibility.  The
latter includes the credit to be attached to his
assertions to police as well
as statements prior and subsequent to the killing which were made to family,
acquaintances and medical
practitioners and at trial. 
<P>

14   	I reject the accused's claim that the victim grabbed the
weapon and the implication that such an action caused it to discharge.
 A
principal reason for so finding is the circumstance that three shots were
fired.  The weapon was semi-automatic and required a
separate application of
pressure to the trigger for each firing.  It is simply not the mechanics of the
weapon that it would continue
discharging shots (until it jammed) upon
continuous  application of pressure to the trigger whether provoked by someone
grabbing
the weapon or otherwise.  Thus even if one of the shots had been to
any extent provoked by such grabbing, two others were achieved
by re-pressuring
the trigger.  Even if some credibility were attached to this claim of the
accused, the reaction of the victim was
in my judgment no more than a defensive
response to threat and does not relieve him of responsibility for intended
killing even if
there was some element of the unexpected emerging from the
reaction of the target.
<P>

15   	I have said however that I do not accept that such
occurred.  If there had been such an element of the unexpected or accident,
I
would expect it to be uppermost in the mind of the person who had wielded the
weapon.  To no one at the scene did the accused make
such a claim and I see no
reason not to accept the evidence of Mrs Campbell that when challenged the
accused said words like "I had
to do it, it was the only way.  I haven't seen
my son in twelve months.  I had to kill her".  Some criticism was directed to
Mrs
Campbell's evidence and I have read the cross examination and had reference
to the testimonies  of other witnesses whose recollection
of what the accused
said is different.  The distinction is of course premised upon the circumstance
that all witnesses were hearing
the same utterance.  I see no reason to regard
Mrs Campbell's evidence as undependable.  Contained in it is a plain lie when
the
accused asserted that he had not seen his son for twelve months and that is
compatible with lies and exaggerations to many people
concerning the issue of
access to his son.  Mrs Campbell could have had no knowledge of the accused's
assertions in that regard other
than by hearing what he said.  Her accuracy in
that aspect is persuasive towards the probable accuracy of all that she
recalled.

<P>

16   	Although at the police station the accused told police
about his wife allegedly grabbing the gun early in his time of custody
there,
there is what I find to be a notable contradiction of the suggestion of the
contribution of an element of accident in the
evidence.  In evidence there is a
typescript of the interview but this was taken from audiotape and the video
machine with sound
track continued to run during an interval while the
audiotapes were being changed.  
<P>

17   	During that period ruminations by the accused were heard
on the sound track.  These include utterances by the accused "She
shouldn't be
dead.  Why did I do it?  Shooting her was stupid".  There is confirmation that
these can be heard in a question asked
of Dr Milton at the earlier trial by
counsel for the accused the transcript of which was tendered before me: see
Exhibit T36 p585
line 52.  It is true that these ruminations are not entirely
unambiguous but they are hardly consistent with a claim that although
he went
armed to force his wife to do no more than talk to him, the weapon unexpectedly
discharged because she grabbed it.  The unprompted
remark "Shooting her was
stupid" offers a compelling insight into the circumstances and the state of
mind of the accused.
<P>

18   	I am satisfied to the necessary standard that at the time
of the killing, the accused intended so to do.  I continue with
some further
observations and findings which have led me to that conclusion.
<P>

19   	Firearms are designed to be lethal.  An issue is whether
any credibility, however faint, should be attached to the claim by
the accused
that he intended to present the weapon merely as a threat.  I find none.  On
occasions the accused has given at least
three different versions of the
provenance of the weapon.  He said he purchased it in January 1992 for $4,000.
It was then intact
and the vendor was a man at Kings Cross.  Later he himself
cut down the barrel and butt.  He has also said that he bought the weapon
in
January 1992 when it was already shortened and he has further said that he
bought it just before the killing.  I cannot determine
where the truth lies as
to the acquisition of the weapon but it is inevitable to conclude that the
accused has been lying about the
matter on some of the occasions.  I mentioned
to counsel my scepticism that anyone would pay $4,000 unless there was a
premium for
illegality (shortened weapons are unlawful) and senior counsel for
the accused invited me to find that his client told the truth
to police when he
said that he paid $4,000 but lied to them about shortening it himself.  If that
be the case then it is interesting
to observe on the video the glib recounting
of detail to police by the accused of how he altered the weapon himself and the
evidence
shows that he later took them on a purposeless journey to search the
location where he told them he had abandoned the offcuts.  The
impression I
formed is that the accused is both a ready and a persistent prevaricator.  
<P>

20   	As a tribunal of fact, I have examined the weapon.  From
the point of view of an operator it is of exquisite simplicity. 
Save the
magazine which moves on guides and engages a catchlock in the conventional
manner - and I note the accused claimed that
he never removed the magazine even
apparently when he claimed he was shortening the weapon - it has only three
functions with which
a user need be concerned:  the cocking piece, the trigger
and the safety catch.
<P>

21   	In his unsworn statement at the previous trial the accused
claimed that he still did not know what a safety looked like although
he added
"I was surprised when he showed us it was on top of the gun.  I would have
thought it was near the trigger".  It is not
exactly clear that "he" was the
vendor but he referred to a fellow who came in and "told us how guns worked".
That was not consistent
with answers to police.  When asked about the bullets,
the accused said "Well, it (presumably the magazine) was already in and the
guy
showed me how to do the safety off and everything was there, that was the whole
thing - just there."  The safety on this weapon
is a simple switch-like button
with forward and back positions.  The accused said that he test fired the
weapon at his mother's home
by discharging a round into a bag of potting mix.
There is no objective evidence to confirm this occurrence but neither counsel
invited
me to doubt it.  Even if the accused was unsure whether the weapon was
safe when the catch was forward or back, after he test fired
it he must have
been able to appreciate that he had only to move it into the alternative
position in order to engage it.  
<P>

22   	The accused is a fitter and machinist by trade and a
commercial pilot by qualification.  These are not academic occupations.
 I find
the claim that he did not recognize and know how to operate the simple safety
mechanism ludicrous and I reject it.  I find
that he knew when he presented the
weapon towards his wife that it was in ready to fire mode with the safety catch
disengaged.
<P>

23   	There is further evidence which convinces me of the
accused's homicidal intention.  The operation of the weapon was such that
spent
cartridge cases would eject and the accused inhibited this by taping over the
ejection port.  Apart from suggesting that the
accused understood somewhat more
about the operation of the weapon than his plea of ignorance about the safety
catch would have it,
 his action strongly suggests that thought was given to
thwarting any ballistic investigation following use of the rifle.  Of course
ballistic investigation cannot be effectively undertaken in the absence of a
weapon which has been disposed of but the significant
matter is that taping the
ejection port demonstrates to my mind an intention that the weapon be fired and
not simply presented as
a threat.  
<P>

24   	I add that the assertion by the accused to Dr Jurek in
1997 that he applied the tape in order to prevent his mother being
upset at
finding an empty cartridge case after the test firing I find quite incredible.
I note however that his remark confirms his
adherence to having test fired the
weapon and I note that if he was really worried about the ejected case, he
could simply pick it
up and dispose of it.  The emergence of this tale years
after the event fortifies the poor view which I have formed of the accused's
veracity.
<P>

25   	A number of subordinate issues were explored.  I do not
find it necessary to trace all of the detail of every one of them
but I have
found nothing which erodes my finding that the accused deliberately and
intentionally killed.  I recognize that the actual
event may not have taken
place in accordance with an original plan or indeed a plan as varied from time
to time to accommodate circumstances
and I would not expect that every action
would coalesce into an ideal pattern of logical steps but the totality of
evidence has led
me exorably to the conclusion which I have stated.
<P>

26   	Because reliance was placed upon them I should mention a
few matters individually.  The accused had purchased the Ford Marquis
a few
days beforehand.  On the preceding Saturday access visit the accused had
nevertheless driven to his sister-in-law's home in
his mother's car.  The Crown
argued that he arrived at the day care centre therefore in a vehicle which he
knew his wife would not
recognize.  Perhaps that was so but I do not regard the
circumstances of the purchase of the vehicle and the use of it on that day
as
specifically inculpatory.  The Ford car was searched and found to contain items
including a dropsheet.  Some of the items were
of utility in the accused's
employment at Petrolink.  I do not find that the dropsheet was in the
conveyance as a potential shroud.
 The contention to that effect rises no
higher than a possibility. 
<P>

27   	Much reference was made to a hole dug by the accused
underneath the home of his mother.  I am not satisfied to the requisite
standard that this was an intended grave for the victim.  That is not to say
that I am positively persuaded to the contrary.  I do
not accept the accused's
version that he was merely digging a hole for a safe in which to keep his
mother's valuables and got carried
away.  I accept that he had made some
enquiries about a safe and the intended structure was to say the least,
extraordinary.  It
would also appear that if such a safe were put in place the
accused's mother would have to retrieve her valuables by going underneath
the
house where the clearance between under the floor and the ground was minimal.
The possibility exists that the hole was intended
to have a dual purpose but as
I have said I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that I can use this
material in proof of guilt
of the accused.
<P>

28   	My attention was drawn to tools which had been newly
painted and it suffices to record also that I do not find anything germane
to
either the issues of culpability or psychology from that circumstance.
<P>

29   	I have mentioned that the accused was at the scene in a
yellow raincoat.  He was wearing sunglasses and had pantyhose in his
pocket.  I
am satisfied that he intended to disguise himself but his purpose may primarily
have been to prevent those at the centre
who knew of the restraining order from
identifying him.  That leads to contemplation of whether such identification
might be foreseen
to be likely to provoke a call to police but ultimately I do
not find that the matter of disguise is useful in contributing to my
findings.
No doubt when the accused confronted his wife she would recognize him but I am
satisfied that he intended to kill her although
whether he intended to do so at
exactly the time and place that it in fact occurred is not now directly in
point.  Counsel argued
that gaudy outer garments such as the raincoat were more
likely to attract attention than deflect it and I think that is correct
but the
overall picture is of the accused bent upon intended mischief and whilst
disguise does not contribute to proof of murder
it does not detract from other
evidence which sustains that conclusion.  
<P>

30   	Subject to the partial defence of diminished
responsibility made available by s23A of the Crimes Act (to which I will refer
simply as s23A), I find the ingredients of murder proved. 
<P>

31   	In a paper published in 1935, Sir Owen Dixon said of the
development of the law of homicide that "for eight centuries the
course of its
very gradual evolution has been from an almost exclusive concern with the
external act that occasioned death to a primary
concern with the mind of the
man who did the act": 9 ALJ (Supp) 64.  In <b>Ryan v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1967%20121%20CLR%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1967 121 CLR
205</a> Windeyer J (@ 238) said of those remarks that "it may be that this process
of common law development is as yet unfinished".
<P>

32   	The common law has been qualified by s23A which is
applicable to this trial in the form prior to substitution by the Crimes
Amendment (Diminished Responsibility) Act 1997.  The conduct of this case has
involved an expansive analysis of the mind of the accused
to the extent that I
was provoked to wondering whether expert witnesses had not at times entirely
ignored the external acts of the
accused, a man on any view obsessed by
deprivation of perceived entitlement to access to his son, who armed himself
and shot dead
the competitor parent.
<P>

33   	It will be necessary to refer to a substantial volume of
psychiatric expert evidence but it will not be necessary to recapitulate
every
hypothesis explored in the evidence.  A primary reason for this is that much of
the hypothetical was dependent upon a variety
of possible fact finding and that
in turn depended upon the credibility of various assertions by the accused.  I
have concluded that
the accused is not a person whose statements can be
regarded as dependable unless there is supporting material.
<P>

34   	It is important to emphasize that the onus of proof is
cast by statute upon the accused in relation to diminished responsibility
and
although the standard is upon balance of probabilities, if I cannot for any
reason including reservation about foundational material
emanating from the
accused, determine where the probability lies the defence will not be
sustained.  
<P>

35   	Before proceeding to refer to evidence I should record
that I am to varying degrees acquainted with all of the expert witnesses.
 Any
rejection of their views should not be taken as implying that I am in any way
doubtful of their respective integrity and professional
skill but, as they
recognized, the ultimate determination must be made by a tribunal of fact,
which desirably would be a cross section
of the community constituting a jury
but in this case, is me.  
<P>

36   	Although the prescriptions of s23A are well known I should
state them to authenticate my approach to the issues which basically
comprise
three:
<P>

37   	First, was there an abnormality of mind of the type
described in the provision, relevantly arising from inherent cause or
induced
by disease?,
<P>

38   	Second, did such abnormality of mind impair mental
responsibility for the accused's act, namely the intentional killing of
his
wife? and,
<P>

39   	Third, if so, was that impairment substantial?
<P>

40   	Abnormality of mind exists where there is deviation from
the range within which there is variation among normal people to
perceive
events, to form sensible judgment as to whether an action is right or wrong and
to exercise will to control actions in accordance
with sensible judgment.
<P>

41   	Mental responsibility also involves the ability to
exercise will over physical acts and the extent to which the mind is answerable
for them.
<P>

42   	A substantial impairment is more than trivial or minimal.
It is substantial if it is such as warrants the reduction of crime
from murder
to manslaughter.  That definition is articulated in the "new" s23A but it
represents an authorized approach to the provision
as presently applicable as
well.
<P>

43   	Retaining therefore a focus upon what needs to be proved
to sustain the partial defence, I turn to some evidence.
<P>

44   	Dr Strum reported on 6 October 1993.  He had seen the
accused on ten occasions between April and August of that year.  He
had also
interviewed his mother.  Part of the history recorded in the report is
disturbing.  The accused told of receiving a note
a few days before the
shooting (elsewhere alleged to have been delivered by Guy at the time of the
access visit on the preceding
Saturday) which was quoted by Dr Strum in what
appeared in his report as verbatim terms:

Guy has been diagnosed as having Perthes Desease (sic). He needs the operation
on his hip and he will wear leg braces for twelve
months. If you love your son
send some money.
<P>

Marilyn."
<P>

45   	It has transpired that Dr Strum has never seen such a note
and the parenthetical observation refers not to a spelling error
in any
original document but in some document (now unable to be produced) which the
accused supplied to Dr Strum as part of history.
 
<P>

46   	The disturbing element is the demonstration that the
accused not only has been shown to prevaricate from time to time but
this would
appear to reveal that he is prepared to manufacture evidence even if it is
purported to be only secondhand.  The accused
bears the onus on the issue of
diminished responsibility but I am positively satisfied that the alleged note
(said to have been on
yellow paper) claimed to have been despatched with Guy on
the Saturday is a matter of invention.  There was in fact a letter from
the
accused's wife dated and sent in June which is in evidence and it referred to
diagnosis of disease by a general practitioner
and informed the accused there
had been a referral to a specialist.  I accept that Mr Wayne Clamback probably
also saw a letter (said
to have been on blue paper) making some reference to
Guy's condition.  I consider his recollection of the content has probably
become
faded over the years.  He remembered it being said that she (the
deceased) wasn't concerned that he (the accused) had obtained a
second opinion.
It is factually incorrect that the accused ever obtained a second opinion and
this suggests to me that there is some
confusion in Mr Clamback's recollection.
He further remembered that the letter said that she was going ahead (with the
operation)
and asked for money.  I am unable to say whether those recollections
may not also be tinged with some confusion.
<P>

47   	Dr Strum had not seen the letter of 28 June 1992 (which is
the only letter which has actually been produced) until he gave
evidence at the
first trial.  After he saw it he volunteered that it was a most reasonable
letter.  I agree.  That such a reasonable
letter was written makes me somewhat
sceptical that the same author would have shortly thereafter despatched one or
two other seemingly
unreasonable ones.  It was said that there was no medical
support for the impression that Guy might be in callipers for a year as
mentioned in the June letter and that correctly reflects the evidence.  But
from wherever Marilyn Maxwell got the idea, she stated
in the letter that it
was conditional upon the condition worsening and there was no suggestion that
it would affect any access by
the accused to his son.  
<P>

48   	I return to Dr Strum's evidence.  In his report of 6
October 1993 he recorded the accused's "conspiracy" assertion that Guy
was
being subjected to unnecessary surgery in order to prevent him having access.
Dr Strum continued:
<P>

"It is certain that irrespective of the irrationality of this proposition, Mr
Maxwell not only believed in its truth at the time
but continues to believe in
its truth".
<P>

I am unable to detect any objective source for Dr Strum's certainty concerning
the accused's belief especially as it might have
existed at the time of the
killing.  It appears to me that Dr Strum would be reliant upon the credibility
of the accused which is
somewhat distant from producing certainty, and indeed
Dr Strum in his own testimony confirmed that he was aware that the accused
had
told him untruths from time to time and he himself had wondered about his
veracity.
<P>

49   	Dr Strum thought that the delivery of the note on the
Saturday with its alleged content could be described as a trigger for
the
homicide.  I have found its existence unproved.  Nor am I satisfied that the
accused had any belief that a conspiracy existed
to subject Guy to unnecessary
surgery at all and specifically no belief that such was being undertaken for
the purpose of denying
him access.  The records of the practice and the
evidence of general practitioners contradict his claim to have gone to see a
doctor
upon receipt of the note.  My acceptance of that evidence is fortified
by my further acceptance of the evidence of Dr Scougall that
he had no
conversation with the accused and specifically no conversation in which he
demanded the joint presence of the parents before
he would discuss issues
surrounding Guy.  A palpable lie about contact with Dr Scougall has been
repeatedly advanced by the accused.
<P>

50   	Dr Strum's first diagnosis was that the accused had a
depressive illness which had developed into a "full blown major depressive
episode".  I do not accept that diagnosis which is based upon unreliable
history, parts of which have been falsified by the accused.
 
<P>

51   	I find other difficulties with Dr Strum's diagnosis.  By
the time he gave evidence at the first trial he was aware of the
opinion of Dr
Westmore diagnosing severe personality disorder but significantly discounting
depression.  In testimony he said he
could well understand Dr Westmore's view
but, at that time at least, he did not see it (I assume, diagnosis of the
accused having
a severe personality disorder) that way.
<P>

52   	By the time Dr Strum saw the accused and reported in
October this year, he had come to accept Dr Westmore's opinion in the
sense
that he now proposed that in 1992 the accused had been suffering from two
abnormalities of mind, a basic severe personality
disorder on which there was
superimposed a depressive illness.  Dr Strum recognized that this change may
lay him open to criticism
and it is to his obvious credit that he nevertheless
was prepared to expound it.  That does not however make the new view attractive
to rely upon.
<P>

53   	Reading of the transcript will reveal the need apparently
felt by counsel to explore at length the bases of a great many 
observations
made by the experts.  For example, Drs Strum and Jurek were examined and cross
examined about a view that a personality
disorder either develops or can
develop from stresses upon extant personality traits or characteristics whereas
Drs Westmore and
Milton were examined and cross examined about their contrary
view that this does not occur.  I am not qualified to rule on the dispute,
if
that is what it is, and I reiterate that my task is to determine whether the
evidence persuades me that the accused has discharged
the onus of proof cast by
s23A.
<P>

54   	There are some matters however upon which I can express a
view.  Dr Strum thought that the accused's remark concerning the
weapon that he
"didn't want a long one" was absurd.  I respectfully disagree.  Short, that is
to say not long weapons are concealable
which is a highly desirable quality
when a person is arming himself with criminal intent.  I was deprived of the
opportunity of seeing
the accused deliver the lengthy unsworn statement
transcribed at the first trial but its content was said  to demonstrate thought
disorder.  The statement certainly pays long attention to irrelevant detail and
the description rambling was not inappropriate. 
I note the various
interventions permitted by the trial judge at the first trial for counsel to
redirect his client's attention.
 However, in reading it I found little
difference between its quality and that of many which I have heard or read
wherein an accused
will elaborate in excruciating detail about peripheral or
irrelevant matters and barely touch upon crucial and inculpatory matters.
 It
has not been in my experience unusual for a brief and almost formal denial of
guilt to be buried within lengthy elaboration of
descriptions of the lifetime
contact between an accused and his victim.  I am unpersuaded to accept the
unsworn statement of the
accused as manifesting thought disorder.
<P>

55   	I have digressed from dealing with specific expert
testimony.  A transcript has been taken of counsel's address in this trial
and
nothing will be gained by my reproduction in these reasons of the points and
counterpoints which can be read there.  I should
advert to the matters which
have led me to the conclusions which I have reached and my reasons for so
doing.
<P>

56   	I have noted that Dr Strum said that on many occasions he
had wondered about the accused's veracity and I accept that he took
that into
account when forming his opinions but given what I have found to be falsity in
critical information upon which reliance
was placed I do not regard those
opinions as sustaining the partial defence.  I add that the fluidity of opinion
as it has changed
over a span now exceeding seven years also causes me to have
the reservation that anything emerging for expression in 1999 may not
reliably
be related back to 24 August 1992.
<P>

57   	Dr Jurek first saw the accused in 1997.  Reporting after
seeing him for the second time in April of that year she opined that
he was
suffering from a Disturbed Mental State, the aetiology of which was a
depression with paranoid features.  She had at the time
seen reports from Drs
Strum and Milton but had not seen any from Dr Westmore.  She expressed her
agreement with Dr Strum's diagnosis
of Acute Depressive Episode and my reasons
for declining to rely upon that diagnosis remain applicable.
<P>

58   	Dr Jurek said that she assessed the accused as pretty
close to psychotic.  By 1999 Dr Strum was hypothesizing to the same
effect,
going so far as to raise the possibility of a M'Naghten defence, that is that
the accused may be not guilty on the ground
of mental illness.  My attention is
directed to the accused's mental state and responsibility on 24 August 1992.
Whilst I am conscious
of the specialized training attaching to the practice of
psychiatry, the weight to be given to such view  bearing in mind that to
be
relevant the view must relate back to the stated date, is somewhat eroded in
the absence of any observation of suggestion of psychosis
by medical
practitioners seeing the accused at the time.  
<P>

59   	Dr Young saw the accused, on one occasion with his mother,
and had discussions mainly about treatment and alleged mistreatment
of Guy.  He
did not formally examine the mental state of the accused but noted that he was
disturbed and agitated, obsessed about
his son and vindictive towards his wife,
but he did not think he was psychiatrically unwell in the delusional sense.  Dr
Young was
seeing the accused between November 1991 and February 1992 and he did
not then consider that the accused was psychotic.  Dr McPhail
described the
accused as a belligerent man who on at least one occasion used the consultation
to criticise his wife in front of his
son.  Dr Doust did a fitness for flying
examination in December 1991.  He noted emotional distress said to centre upon
deprivation
of access.  This was of course an exaggeration as the accused was
having access to his son although overnight access had been stopped
after an
incident at about that time.  Dr Doust thought that the accused could rapidly
develop an anxiety depression in that state
of affairs.  I infer therefore that
he was not then depressed nor did Dr Doust assess him as psychotic.  He
expressed concern at
about what might happen in the future.
<P>

60   	Dr Kitson had an opportunity to observe the accused during
a very significant period.  He first saw the accused on 15 January
1992
although the consultation was about cholesterol levels.  The accused returned
to see him on 4 February and spoke about marital
problems including alleged
difficulty in having access to his son.  I repeat, in truth access was not
being denied rather the accused
was not apparently getting the access which he
wished.  Dr Kitson thought that the accused "was considerably seriously
agitated".
 The accused came to see him again on 16 February, 5 March, 8 April
and 11 May.  These consultations involved distress about the
accused's
perception of his family situation.  Dr Kitson continued to see him although
for medical problems on 2 June, 5 July and
15 August, the lastmentioned
occasion being just over one week before the killing.  Dr Kitson thought that
the accused was depressed
and extremely agitated however it offers some
indication of the scale of the situation that Dr Kitson did not think that the
accused
was in need of any treatment other than counselling.  This he
recommended but the accused did not implement the recommendation telling
Dr
Kitson that he preferred to continue seeing him.  Dr Kitson confirmed that if
he had been very concerned about mental state he
would have insisted that the
accused see a trained counsellor and if he thought that he was even more
seriously disturbed he would
have insisted that the accused see a psychiatrist.
He insisted upon neither of these two things which suggests to me that it is
highly
unlikely that the accused was psychotic or near psychotic then or at the
time of the killing.  True Dr Kitson was not a psychiatrist
but I would expect
the expertise of a competent general practitioner such as Dr Kitson
particularly having the advantage of multiple
encounters, to extend to
perception of the possibility of psychiatric illness and the need for expert
consultation.  Dr Kitson obviously
did not perceive that possibility or
need.
<P>

61   	I do not place any reliance upon the views of Dr Strum and
Dr Jurek, expressed and to a large extent formed many years after,
 that the
accused was at the time of killing near to psychotic.  I have already commented
on the basic defects in history which infect
the views of both Dr Strum and Dr
Jurek and therefore their opinion concerning major depressive episode.  My
reliance upon Dr Jurek's
views is also inhibited by apparent contradiction in
some evidence given by her in the first trial on 25 May 1997.  As I have noted,
she saw the accused in prison in March and April of that year and she testified
(transcript p 468) that when she saw him at Long
Bay he was not deeply
depressed but then expressed an opinion (transcript page 495) that he was still
suffering from a major depressive
illness.  This may be explained in Dr Jurek's
view that the illness fluctuates but if manifestation is capable of fluctuating
then
I have great difficulty in projecting that opinion back to August 1992
from consultations in 1997 and making a finding that the accused
was suffering
from abnormality of mind when he engaged in the act of homicide.  
<P>

62   	I am conscious that Dr Jurek's references to
psycho-dynamics indicate her recognition that neither illness nor human
behaviour
occurs in a static fashion so that such matters can be frozen as it
were at a chosen moment (such as that at which homicide is committed)
however
there are a number of factual matters and opinions which Dr Jurek apparently
relied upon which I do not accept.  The accused
reported losing about twenty
kilos in weight.  I reject the evidence of the accused's mother in
corroboration of this and I am not
satisfied that it is realistically supported
by the evidence of Mr Bone.  If anyone would have noticed such a dramatic
decline in
body bulk I would have expected it to have been Dr Kitson.  His
evidence tended to the contrary.  If the accused had had a weight
loss in 1991
he was, as reported to Dr Kitson, gaining in 1992.  I find it hard to regard
this assertion of weight loss as a reliable
foundation for opinion about florid
psychiatric illness at 24 August 1992.
<P>

63   	I do not share the view that it was "crazy" to test fire
the rifle and to tape the ejection port.  Even if the claimed intention
to
assess noise is accepted I would not expect that a single discharge from a .22
rifle (shortened) would be likely to provoke more
than momentary curiosity in a
neighbourhood.  Dr Jurek referred to taping the ejection port in the context of
the accused's assertion
to her that he did so because he did not want his
mother to be distressed by finding an empty cartridge.  As a reason it does not
merit Dr Jurek's description and I have already mentioned that it would be easy
enough simply to pick up the shell but more importantly
I do not regard what he
stated to Dr Jurek as representing the true motive of the accused for sealing
off the ejection port.
<P>

64   	I do not overlook that in 1997 Dr Jurek explained her
report in terms of thinking that the accused suffered a "combination
of a
depression on top of a personality disorder" which is in harmony with the
opinion finally expressed by Dr Strum in 1999.  However
she was also
significantly affected in forming that view by the circumstances of the
delivery of the yellow paper note on the Saturday
which I am not satisfied
existed.  Dr Jurek thought this was a trigger for the killing on the following
Monday and said that in its
absence she would have to concede that she could
not see what triggered the killing.
<P>

65   	The third psychiatrist called on behalf of the accused was
Dr Westmore.  He first saw the accused within two weeks of the
killing.  He was
apparently retained by a solicitor then acting for the accused. He next saw him
at the request of another solicitor
 on 5 February 1997.  As he conceded at the
first trial, when he engaged in the latter consultation and wrote his report,
he was
not conscious that he had seen and reported on the accused previously
and the respective reports were not cross referenced.
<P>

66   	The report of 29 September 1992 obviously offers the
nearest to contemporary psychiatric assessment of the accused at a time
relevant to the killing and the defence raised on his behalf.  The opinion and
conclusions expressed then, I set out in entirety:
<P>

"Your client faces the serious charge of murder.  The deceased person in this
matter is his wife, from whom he was separated for
a period of twelve months
before the incident leading to her death.  It would appear that the issue of
access to their son was the
focus of much disharmony with Mr Maxwell believing
that his wife's mother and sister controlled and dominated her to the extent
that
they excluded him seeing his child.
<P>

He expressed his view that his wife was a somewhat inadequate person who was
completely controlled by these two people (her mother
and sister).
<P>

While your client does not suffer any specific psychiatric disability in the
form of a major depressive illness or a psychotic process
such a schizophrenia,
he clearly was greatly disturbed and distressed by the circumstances
surrounding the breakdown of the marriage.
 In view of the apparent intensity
of the relationship he seems to have had with his son, certainly it is as he
described it to me,
the possibility of the defence provocation should be
considered in this case.  I should note that at this stage I have no documents
relating to the facts in this matter, nor statements of witnesses that might
add further history to that provided to me by Mr Maxwell.
<P>

I am a little unclear at this stage as to whether his preoccupation with his
son was an abnormal one having already noted that it
was an extremely intense
one.  At this time I do not believe the defence of diminished responsibility is
available to him but should
there be other evidence to suggest an abnormality
of mind being present at the time then I would be happy to review my
conclusions.
<P>

If I can provide any further information or assistance please do not hesitate
to contact me."
<P>

67   	I can ignore the reference to provocation.  It is not
suggested that the facts on any view fall within the context of s23
of the
Crimes Act.  In the course of time Dr Westmore has come to the opinion that the
accused suffers from a severe personality
disorder, the magnitude of which he
assesses as constituting an abnormality of mind.  To be relevant to my task
such abnormality
of mind had to be present on 24 August 1992.  Dr Westmore has
explained that he would not, save in an exceptional case, diagnose
such a
personality disorder from a single consultation and I accept that.  What
demands my attention is the absence of any suggestion
in September 1992 that
further consultation was indicated.  As the above extract shows, there is no
request based upon either the
accused's presentation nor even upon intuition,
that there should be further examination for assessment. Review was postulated
upon
the production of other evidence and not any further investigation by the
psychiatrist.  I find it significant that at a time so
proximate to the event
Dr Westmore confidently negatived major depressive illness and psychotic
process.
<P>

68   	My conclusion is that nothing in the presentation of the
accused to the expert offered even suspicion that he was suffering
from a
personality disorder of the magnitude now suggested - or, given the absence of
mention - at all. 
<P>

69   	When Dr Westmore was retained on the second occasion, he
first reported (7 February 1997) that he would require further consultation
before he could form an opinion.  This was arranged and in his report of 2
April 1997 he offered the opinion of severely disturbed
personality to be
classified as disorder.  He has adhered to that view and his conviction in it
has been intensified by many encounters
with the accused since.  Dr Westmore
has described how the accused even approaches him when he is at the prison to
see someone else
and he has observed the same traits and characteristics
manifested in such an extreme way that he is even more certain in his
conclusion
about disorder.  I recognize that Dr Westmore has said that it is
necessary for him (or for anyone) to see the accused on many occasions
in order
for the impressions to be communicated and diagnosis made.
<P>

70   	I accept what I understand to be the conventional
definition that a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner
experience
and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of the
individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset
in adolescence
or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.
On that definition, of course, if Dr
Westmore's present diagnosis is correct
then, absent its identification or observation of suggestions of its presence
at the interview
in September 1992, the disorder must nevertheless have been
extant.
<P>

71   	This leads to comment upon testimony from Dr Milton who
was called by the Crown.  He has never interviewed the accused.  It
was said by
counsel that this was because the request was made after Dr Milton had written
a report to the representatives of the
prosecution.  Where the Crown bears the
onus of proof of guilt, no adverse inference can be drawn from an accused
exercising the
privilege of silence.  I apprehend that the situation is
different when by express legislation the accused bears the onus of proof,
however I infer that the accused acted on legal advice in refusing to see Dr
Milton and I do not weigh  that circumstance against
his interest.  I deal with
the issues on the objective basis that Dr Milton did not have the experience of
consultation which was
available to Drs Strum, Jurek and Westmore.
<P>

72   	As I perceive the situation the final views of Drs Milton
and Westmore are not greatly separated.  Although there is the difference
to
which I will refer, it is of interest to note that Dr Milton's present view is
highly compatible with that expressed by Dr Westmore
when he saw the accused in
1992.  Dr Milton acknowledged that the accused manifested a number of
personality traits and characteristics
but he did not assess them as
constituting diagnosed disorder.  Dr Westmore considered that they do.  Of
course there are differences
in the material upon which they each rely to reach
their respective conclusions but little would be gained by my attempting to
collate
and tabulate all the pros and cons. 
<P>

73   	One matter to which I will refer in deference to the
extent of attention paid by counsel concerns a remark by Dr Milton about
Dr
Westmore's inability to classify the personality disorder which he diagnosed
into a particular category.  Dr Westmore opined that
the disorder was of a
mixed type.  My attention was drawn, as was that of witnesses on many
occasions, to the 4th Edn of Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual - DSM IV.  That
publication refers to ten specific patterns of personality disorder: paranoid,
schizoid, schizotypal,
antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic,
avoidant, dependent and obsessive-compulsive respectively.  DSM IV however
recognizes
"disorder not otherwise specified" including cases where a person's
pattern meets the general criteria for several of the traits.
 This last I
understand to comprehend Dr Westmore's diagnosis of mixed disorder.  For
myself, I reach no conclusion adverse to the
case being presented for the
accused by reason of the absence of specific label.
<P>

74   	I earlier mentioned the videotaping at the police station
on the morning of 24 August.  The video tapes have been viewed by
the experts
and somewhat intensely studied by Dr Milton in the absence of direct contact
with the accused.  I am in a position similar
to Dr Milton.  It is an
interesting observation by Dr Westmore who apparently had not seen the tapes
until recently that upon viewing
them he described that "he is an obsessional
narcissistic man, he externalizes responsibilities for his actions onto others,
his
themes are generally ones of trying to provide some rational explanation or
justification for his actions towards his wife".   Save
that I would substitute
"justification for killing her" for the somewhat euphemistic "rational
explanation or justification for his
actions towards his wife".  Dr Westmore's
words offer a fair general description of my own impression.
<P>

75   	My conclusion about the divergence of view between Dr
Westmore and Dr Milton is that they differ essentially as to degree.
 My task
is not to certify the correctness of any such opinion and I am far from
qualified so to do.  My task is to apply the evidence
which I accept to
answering two of the three questions which I have posed concerning s23A,
whether there was a deviation from the
range over which normal people might
vary in the perception of events, the ability to judge right and wrong and will
power to control
physical acts (as possessed by the accused at the time of his
homicidal act) and second, whether if so, the impairment of mental
responsibility which that represents was substantial so that it warrants
reduction of what was otherwise murder to manslaughter.
 
<P>

76   	When Dr Milton gave evidence at the first trial he was
cross examined (25 May 1997) about some evidence which he had given
in the
trial of an accused Mr Nguyen where he had said:
<P>

"Well, my own impression was that this was not the result of a depressive
illness or psychiatric disorder.  It brings up I suppose
in a way a kind of
philosophical issue really but psychiatrists will sometimes see human behaviour
as a disease, whereas this is
often the way humans have been behaving for
thousands of years.
<P>

Psychiatrists will often perceive a particular behaviour as disease whereas if
you look at literature, history and everything else,
it is the way human beings
have been behaving right through history and they regarded it as normal
tragedy, normal suffering if you
like, part of the way of ordinary life, is
difficult life.  As we all know life wasn't meant to be easy and that
psychiatrists, I
think, have a tendency to say that look, this is a disease
because it fits with certain criteria and I think that although psychiatric
disease involves human suffering, not all human suffering is necessarily
disease or abnormality of the mind, if you like, putting
it in legal terms."
<P>

77   	Coincidentally that very passage was sometime after the
first trial described as a sound commonsense approach to be taken
(to
diminished responsibility) in the Court of Criminal Appeal:  <b>R v Nguyen</b>
CCA unreported 20 March 1998 per Hunt CJ at CL.  
<P>

78   	In a report prepared on 8 October 1999 Dr Milton confirmed
his adherence to the above view and stated:
<P>

"When I gave evidence I referred to what I believed to be a tendency in
psychiatry to expand the borders of illness, the result
being that a
considerable amount of ordinary human suffering or individual differences might
be regarded (especially in legal proceedings
involving a serious offence) as
abnormality.  Mr Maxwell has been described as being discursive, obsessional,
self centred, and unduly
suspicious.  Dr Westmore considers these constitute a
personality disorder, but was unable to classify it into a particular category.
Homicide is a rare crime and it is likely that those committing it will have
personalities different, in the main, from the rest
of the population.  That
does not, in my view, constitute sufficient reason to make a diagnosis of
personality disorder (especially
of a non specific kind) and to regard the
personality disorder as substantially diminishing a person's responsibility for
having
committed a serious crime."
<P>

79   	I have commented above on the absence of specificity of
disorder but, placing that to one side, the balance of Dr Milton's
remarks do
attract me as a sound commonsense basis for approach.
<P>

80   	I am acutely conscious that from the torrent of words in
the reports and the testimonies there can be constructed plausible
theses for
support of a partial defence but, as the witnesses recognized, the task of
evaluation must be undertaken by the tribunal
of fact.  Although, as is obvious
in its expression, s23A is concerned with mental responsibility I do not
believe that the law has
developed to a point where when dealing with it, it is
appropriate to ignore the external acts.  Indeed the necessity so to do can
be
demonstrated by extrapolation from the evidence.  It was remarked that
psycho-dynamic theorists postulate that anger and depression
are external and
internal manifestations of the same thing.  It is difficult to imagine that the
community (or the law) would accept
that anger in isolation, however
heightened, would diminish responsibility for intentional killing nor that such
is contemplated
by s23A.  Yet it was accepted by all expert witnesses that
depression (even of the non-endogenous variety) was an available basis
for the
defence. Logically then, if so, why not anger? I do not suggest that this
theory or my comment is directly relevant to present
findings but it is
mentioned as a demonstration of the seeming paradoxes that, if one chooses, can
be extracted from the evidence.
 It is therefore relevant in my view to bear in
mind that the accused executed the homicide after preparing by arming himself
with
a loaded weapon with disengaged safety and lying in wait for the
victim.
<P>

81   	I shall summarize some conclusions.  I am not satisfied on
the balance of probabilities that the accused was at the time of
the killing
suffering from what I will call for convenience clinical depression.  Neither
Dr Westmore nor Dr Milton supports that
view and I have mentioned the
deficiencies of fact underlying the formation of those opinions which do
support depression.  I have
not thought it necessary to detail the endorsements
in the prison medical file but it suffices to say that they do not corroborate
major depressive episode as the accused was observed shortly after 24 August
and I have considerable reservation about the proposition
that killing could
have a cathartic effect of ameliorating such a condition if it existed. I
record that there was hearsay evidence
about opinion concerning the
availability of a defence of diminished responsibility said to be held
particularly by Dr Barclay and
Dr Lewin.  The suggestion was not that their
opinions advanced the case of the accused but in the circumstances I have put
what was
said entirely to one side and that hearsay has not contributed to any
conclusion which I have reached.
<P>

82   	I have given careful consideration to whether the thesis
proposed by Dr Westmore that the accused is suffering and was suffering
severe
personality disorder should be accepted.  The firming of his view by repeated
contact with the accused conveyed considerable
conviction and as I have said,
by definition if the accused now has a personality disorder of the requisite
diagnosable severity,
then it was extant in 1992.  My final conclusion is that
the accused has not discharged the onus of proof in relation to this issue.
The cogency of Dr Westmore's opinion is undermined by the absence of any
reference to any signs or indications of the possibility
of such at the early
and therefore, in a temporal sense, most advantageous consultation.  Second,
given that a matter of degree is
involved, I consider weight should be given to
the estimates of Dr Milton which have been consistent throughout and consistent
with
the philosophy which he has disclosed and espoused.  I do not consider
that the relatively late arrival of support for the diagnosis
of severe
personality disorder from Dr Strum and Dr Jurek brings the balance of
probability into the accused's favour.
<P>

83   	I am not, of course, holding that the accused does not and
did not have personality traits including being obsessional, discursive,
narcissistic and suspicious, nor do I reject the notion that in the crisis in
which he perceived himself he could be described as
being in marked distress.
That was very much the way Dr Westmore first saw him and Dr Milton still sees
him.  The issue is whether
or not the degree of traits are such that
abnormality of mind can be diagnosed.
<P>

84   	I am unpersuaded that the accused's symptoms, traits or
characteristics affected his perception, judgment and control in the
relevant
ways so that I assess him to be outside the variation I would estimate for
normal people in the circumstances.  I am not
persuaded on the evidence that
the accused has proved that he was at the time suffering from a relevant
abnormality of mind.
<P>

85   	Further, assuming to the contrary of my findings that the
accused did suffer an abnormality of mind in the relevant sense,
I would not
assess impairment of mental responsibility as substantial.  I recognize that
such is a value judgment but I take into
account all the surrounding facts
including the preparations made by the accused, arming himself, not applying
the safety, disguise
and lying in wait for the victim. I do not consider any
impairment warrants reduction of his crime to manslaughter.
<P>

86   	I find the accused guilty of murder as indicted and enter
verdict and judgment of conviction accordingly.
