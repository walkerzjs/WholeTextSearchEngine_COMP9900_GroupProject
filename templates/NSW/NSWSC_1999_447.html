<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  By a Notice of Motion filed on 24 February 1999, the
second defendant, so far as is presently material, seeks the following
orders:
<P>

	(a)  An order pursuant to s 5(1) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act</a></i></b><i> <b>1987</b></i><b> </b>that these proceedings be
transferred to the Family Court of Australia, Sydney Registry, 
<P>

	(b)  That all moneys or other securities lodged with this Court by the
plaintiff by way of security for his costs be released to
the plaintiff upon
its undertaking to lodge such moneys or other securities forthwith with the
Registrar of the Family Court of Australia,
Sydney Registry, and
<P>

	(c)  That he be completely released from an undertaking formerly given by him,
or alternatively,
<P>

	(d)  That he be released from such undertaking to the extent of allowing him
to grant equitable mortgages to the value of $340,000
over certain properties
in order to fund his legal expenses of the litigation.
<P>

2	It is convenient firstly to set out some of the background.  The second and
third defendants, Colin Mead (the husband) and Lucy
Guitar Mead (the wife) were
married on 11 December 1982 and separated on 4 November 1996.  The wife has two
sisters, whom I shall
refer to briefly as Grace and Josephine.  The plaintiff
is a company incorporated in Taiwan and, according to a document headed
"Articles
of Incorporation," in the bundle before me, the wife holds
approximately forty four percent of the shares in that company and, according
to clause 8, is the "sole director to carry on the business".
<P>

3	The first defendant, Hypec Electronics Pty Limited is a company which was
incorporated in this State on 5 March 1985.  Its shareholders
are the husband
and wife, who are also the current directors, but because of the disputes
between them the company is deadlocked.
 Hypec Technology Group Pty Limited is
another company with the same shareholders and directors, incorporated in July
1992, and one
of the husband's allegations is that the business of Hypec
Electronics Pty Limited was, without his knowledge, diverted to Hypec
Technology Group Pty Limited.
<P>

4	Hypec Information Technology Services Pty Limited is another company
incorporated here on 9 January 1997.  The sole shareholder
is the wife's sister
Grace and apparently she owns the shares under different variations of her
name, and holds them both in trust.
 The directors are such sister and also the
wife's mother.
<P>

5	On 4 March 1997 the husband commenced proceedings in the Family Court of
Australia, Sydney Registry, for a property settlement.
 On 19 September 1997
the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings.  By its Statement of Claim it
claims that as a result of representations
fraudulently made by the husband and
wife it advanced moneys to the first defendant, for use in the development of
its business and
for working capital, and that such advances were to be repaid
to the plaintiff from the sales of goods by the first defendant to
third
parties.  It is alleged that the loans amounted to something in excess of $4.8
million.
<P>

6	On first examination of the Statement of Claim I must say I have a number of
difficulties with it and it has been submitted in
addresses that it is in
effect a claim for goods sold and delivered, although one wonders, if that is
so, why the claim has not been
pleaded as such.  As a result of what are
alleged to be the fraudulent mis-representations of the husband and wife, not
only has
the first defendant been sued for the recovery of the money but they
have been sued for fraudulent mis-representation and also for
negligence and
for liability alleged to arise under various provisions of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

7	The first defendant has filed no defence.  It is, as I say, deadlocked and
apparently does not currently have any assets.  Judgment
for the full amount of
the claim, $4,884,466 has been entered against it and judgment has also been
signed against the wife for damages
to be assessed.  The husband has filed a
defence denying that he made any mis-representations to the plaintiff and
denying that he
is indebted to the plaintiff as a result of the
transactions.
<P>

8	The Statement of Claim alleges that the representations said to be false were
made to the plaintiff by the husband and wife. 
I have some difficulty seeing
how the plaintiff could succeed on the basis of representations made by the
wife to a company of which
she was apparently the sole director.  If the
document I have referred to is inaccurate, she was certainly one of the
directors and
a substantial shareholder.  Further and better particulars
alleged mis-representations were made mainly by the husband, but he claims
not
to be able to speak Chinese.
<P>

9	There is also evidence that throughout the marriage the wife attended to the
financial affairs of their jointly owned companies
whilst the husband attended
to technical matters, and there is evidence from the husband that the wife was
the sole signatory on
the first defendant's bank account at all relevant times.
It is claimed in correspondence that a number of documents disclosed on
discovery by the plaintiff in these proceedings should properly have been in
possession of the first, second or third defendants,
but these documents are
apparently being used by the wife in the Family Court proceedings.
<P>

10	In many respects, as I say, the present proceedings can be described as
unusual.  In a sense - and I use those words advisedly
- the wife's company
(the plaintiff) alleges that as a result of fraudulent mis-representations by
her (and her husband) there is
a debt owing by a company of which she had
effective financial control (the first defendant) to another company controlled
by her
(the plaintiff). 
<P>

11	It has been submitted on behalf of the husband that the present proceedings
are in effect an attempt to eliminate or to reduce
the assets of the first
defendant owned jointly by the husband and wife by diverting its funds to the
plaintiff, a company owned
substantially by the wife, so that there is less to
divide between the husband and wife in the Family Court proceedings, and so
that
the wife will instead receive most or all of the assets of the first
defendant as a shareholder of the plaintiff.  These suggestions
are denied but,
having regard to the unusual nature of the proceedings, the possibility cannot
be entirely excluded.
<P>

12	Even if the present proceedings are not a device of the nature I have
outlined, that would be their effect and it is still necessary
to resolve the
issues in this case to determine what assets are available for the division
between husband and wife in the Family
Court.
<P>

13	There is another unusual feature about the transactions, involving husband
and wife and it is this.  A number of properties were
apparently purchased in
the name of the husband and wife during the period of the marriage.  The
plaintiff claims that the purchase
of these properties was financed out of the
moneys advanced to the first defendant, the subject of the plaintiff's claim,
although
in some cases they were acquired before the date of the advances
alleged, and in one case before the incorporation of the first defendant.
<P>

14	In respect of some of these properties, particularly 2 Singleton Road,
Laughtondale and 34 Herbert St, West Ryde, the properties
were mortgaged,
apparently by way of third party mortgage by the husband and wife, to the
Commonwealth Bank to secure overdraft advances
by that bank to Hypec Technology
Group Pty Limited, but subsequently these mortgages have been assigned by the
bank to the wife's
sister Grace, the husband claiming this was done without his
prior knowledge or consent.  More recently the sister Grace has obtained
possession of those properties as mortgagee.
<P>

15	It is convenient, first, to deal with the application relating to what has
been referred to as the husband's undertaking.  In
fact, there is in force no
such undertaking but there is an injunction.  
<P>

16	By Notice of Motion filed in Court on 9 December last, the plaintiff sought
an injunction restraining the husband from transferring,
assigning, alienating,
or further encumbering his interest in any specified real property other than a
transfer to the wife of any
part thereof as may be ordered by the Family Court
of Australia pending final determination of these proceedings or the consent of
the plaintiff.
<P>

17	It appears that an undertaking to that effect had been formulated and signed
by the husband but not filed as it was not in the
appropriate form, and on 9
December the application was made, as I say, for an injunction to that effect.
An injunction was granted
ex-parte by his Honour Greg James J and later that
day, following the appearance of the solicitor for the husband, the injunction
was extended until further order, but liberty was granted to restore the matter
to the list on two days notice and a transcript of
that day shows that what was
envisaged was an application for variation to the effect of the form now set
out in the current Notice
of Motion permitting the husband to charge his
interest in the property to provide for his legal fees.
<P>

18	I deal with this application first, because it seems that as this is an
injunction granted by this Court it is appropriate for
this Court to deal with
it rather than first determine whether the matter should be transferred to the
Family Court, and leave it
for that Court to deal with.  There is no evidence
and, as far as I can see, has not been any evidence that the husband is seeking
or threatening to dispose of any of his assets, except that he wishes to give
equitable charges over his interest in some of the
properties to pay his legal
expenses both for these proceedings and the proceedings in the Family Court.
<P>

19	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that he should not use the
money in this way.  But that would effectively prevent
him defending the case
and it may be - and I am not in any position to judge - that he has a good
defence to the present case and
reasonable grounds for achieving a significant
result in the Family  Court proceedings.  In my view, these matters not
involving
any threat to dispose of assets for an improper purpose such as to
avoid being in a position to satisfy any judgment that may be
recovered do not
constitute grounds for a Mareva injunction.
<P>

20	No other basis has been shown for the grant of the injunction.  This is not
a matter where, as I understand it, the assets of
the company can be traced to
the directors because of any breach of fiduciary duty on their part.  And, in
any event, it is not the
first defendant that is seeking the orders, but an
outside third party.
<P>

21	I am therefore of the view that the injunction previously granted should be
dissolved.
<P>

22	I turn now to consider the application for the cross-vesting.
<P>

23	The proceedings presently before the Family Court will involve an
examination of the affairs of the various companies to which
I have referred
and a couple of other companies acquired during the course of the marriage.  In
those proceedings the main witnesses
are likely to be the husband, the wife,
the wife's sister Grace, her mother, her father, and various employees of the
various companies,
both past and present, together with expert accountants on
both sides.
<P>

24	The Supreme Court proceedings will also involve an accounting of the
business of the first defendant during the marriage and
it is expected that the
main witnesses will be the husband, the wife, the wife's sister Grace, the
wife's sister Josephine, and the
expert accountants.
<P>

25	A number of common questions will arise as to the management of the various
companies, particularly as the financial management
of the companies, and the
signing of cheques and the making of the relevant accounting entries, was, the
husband claims, all done
by his wife.
<P>

26	All the above considerations demonstrate that both sets of proceedings
involve a number of common issues, common witnesses and
the examination and
analysis of the same accounting documents.  In addition the size of the assets
belonging to the husband and wife
and available for division between them upon
dissolution of the marriage can only be ascertained after the determination of
the current
proceedings.
<P>

27	It was for this reason that when the Family Court proceedings were listed
for hearing on 9 November 1998 and an adjournment was
granted on the
application of the wife, Cohen J said:
<P>

	"If the proceedings take place before me because they are not adjourned, the
wife, the husband and the wife's sister who is the
witness for the wife's
family company in the Supreme Court proceedings and would be a necessary
witness before me will all give evidence
and I shall have to determine their
credit.  There is a real prospect that I might take a different view of their
credit to the Supreme
Court Judge who subsequently hears the matter before the
Supreme Court.....
<P>

	In those circumstances, it is quite impracticable for me to continue this
hearing.  I think there is a substantial risk that I
might wrongly determine
the parties' assets because what I shall be trying to do is determine the
outcome of the Supreme Court proceedings.
 Such an error would create great
injustice for one of the parties."
<P>

28	On behalf of the plaintiff it has been submitted that the proceedings should
not be transferred because it involves a discrete
question which is preliminary
to the proceedings in the Family Court and that it is simply a case of
following a paper trail.
<P>

29	For the reasons I have already given, I am not satisfied that is a fair
assessment of what is involved or the nature of the present
case.
<P>

30	The only practical way, in my view, for the various matters to be resolved
is for both sets of proceedings to be heard together.
 I am therefore
satisfied, within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i></b>, that these proceedings are related to the
proceedings pending in the Family Court and it is more appropriate that they be
determined
in the Family Court in the interests of justice so that they can be
heard together and common issues arising in both sets of proceedings
can be
determined by the same court at the same time. 
<P>

31	I therefore propose to transfer the present proceedings to the Family Court
of Australia, Sydney  Registry.
<P>

32	That leaves outstanding the orders sought in paragraph 3 of the Notice of
Motion relating to the securities lodged in this Court
by way of security for
the husband's costs.
<P>

33	I am not satisfied that I should make any order about that.  It seems to me
that the security given will be dealt with administratively
either by being
transferred to the Sydney Registry of the Family Court along with the rest of
the matter, or else will remain in
this Court as security for the husband's
costs in the Supreme Court part of the proceedings if he should be successful
and an order
is made in respect of his costs against the present plaintiff.
<P>

34	I therefore order that the injunction granted by this Court on 9 December
1998 be dissolved and, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i></b>, I order that these proceedings number
12674/97 be transferred to the Family Court of Australia, Sydney Registry.
<P>

35	In view of the fact that the plaintiff opposed the application for
dissolution of the injunction and was unsuccessful in that
opposition, the
plaintiff should pay so much of the applicant's costs as relate solely to the
application for dissolution of the
injunction. The balance of the costs, being
substantially the costs of the application for cross-vesting, should be costs
in the
cause, and I so order.
<P>

36	I grant liberty to any party to apply in respect of the security lodged, if
such application should prove necessary.
