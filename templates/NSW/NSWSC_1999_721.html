<b><u>30103/98 MICHAEL KHOURY &amp; ORS V MALEK KASSIM T/AS KASSIM
CONSTRUCTIONS &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  By these proceedings the plaintiffs Michael Khoury, Mary Khoury
and David Khoury seek prerogative relief against
the first defendant Malik
Kassim trading as Kassim Constructions and the second defendant Consumer Claims
Tribunal.  Michael Khoury
is the son of Mary and David Khoury.  The first
defendant carries on business as a carpenter.  The Tribunal has filed a
submitting
appearance except as to costs.
<P>

2	In some respects the evidence in these proceedings is vague, confusing and
incomplete but it would appear that the background
situation is as follows.  In
or about 1995 Mary Khoury purchased in her own name, premises at 60 Burgess
Street Beverly Park.  Shortly
thereafter in order to facilitate the
re-financing of the premises, she granted to her son Michael a one tenth share
in the premises.
 Thereafter, they held the premises as tenants in common, with
Mary holding a nine tenth share and Michael a one tenth share.
<P>

3	However, while Mrs Khoury was the sole registered proprietor of the premises,
the first defendant on 22 June 1996 gave a quote
for building work to be
carried out to the property.  This involved substantial alterations as set out
in plans drawn by Michael
Khoury who carried on practice as an architectural
draftsperson.
<P>

4	The first defendant contends that there was an oral agreement between himself
and all plaintiffs that the subject work would proceed
in accordance with the
quote.  There is no doubt that the quote was accepted, but the plaintiffs
contend that the contract (which
was an oral one) was solely between Mrs Khoury
and the first defendant.  The first defendant claims that the contract work was
executed
and a large number of variations were carried out.  This became the
subject of a heated dispute between the parties and also complaints
were made
that certain of the work carried out by the first defendant was defective.
<P>

5	It would appear that Michael supervised the work, and progress payments were
made to the first defendant, by Michael, from an
account in his name.  It seems
that the original contract price was paid but not the amount claimed in respect
of the disputed work.
<P>

6	On 7 November 1996, Marsdens, solicitors of Campbelltown, wrote on behalf of
the first defendant, a letter addressed <i>to "Mr D Khoury and Mr M Khoury</i>"
seeking to recover the sum of $23,475 allegedly owed by them to the first
defendant.  The first defendant later conceded that this
claim was erroneously
overstated by $3,540.
<P>

7	On 13 November 1996 Photios Vouroudis &amp; Co, solicitors, of Burwood, wrote
on behalf of Mr and Mrs D Khoury a reply to this
letter in which they denied
any liability to the first defendant and stated, (inter alia):
<P>

<i> "We are instructed that the cost of rectifying the abovementioned defective
building work, together with the cost of replacing timber
which belonged to our
client and unlawfully used by Mr Kassim in the construction of the balcony and
roof, will exceed the amount
of your client's alleged claim.</i>
<P>

<i>Further, should this matter proceed further, our client intends to call
expert evidence to prove that the amount of timber used on
the site is valued
for less than the amount of $16,000 which was paid by our client directly to
Advance Timber.</i>
<P>

<i>Our client assumes that the timber purchased by our client was used by Mr
Kassim on another job site.  Our client will also call expert
evidence to prove
that the roof in its present state would not last more than 3 to 4 years, and
will need replacement thereafter".</i>
<P>

8	Apparently about this time arrangements were made on behalf of the plaintiffs
to obtain experts reports with regard to the estimated
cost of rectification of
the alleged defective workmanship.
<P>

9	The plaintiffs' solicitors received no reply to this letter, but on 30 April
1997 the first defendant lodged a claim with the
Building Disputes Tribunal
constituted pursuant to the provisions of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act
1987</i> ("the Act').  [The Act was repealed by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act 1998</a>,
as from 1 March 1999].  Each of the plaintiffs was joined as a party in these
proceedings.  The amount of the claim was $19,935.
 Mr G Vardas was appointed
Referee and the matter was first listed for hearing in September 1997.  The
precise date was not stated
in evidence.
<P>

10	It is convenient, before referring to the evidence of what transpired before
the Tribunal, to note the two specific bases on
which the plaintiffs contend
there was a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness.  The first ground
is that the Referee
failed to comply with the obligations imposed upon him
under section 26 of the Act.  Section 26 is in the following terms:-
<P>

<b><i>Procedure to be followed when a tribunal's jurisdiction is
disputed</i></b>
<P>

<i>(1)  If, before a tribunal has determined a consumer claim, the jurisdiction
of the tribunal to hear and determine the claim is disputed
by a party to the
claim, the tribunal must not proceed to determine the claim without first
giving a ruling as to whether or not
it has that jurisdiction</i>
<P>

<i>(2)  A tribunal must not, of its own motion, make an order under section 30
(2) (a) dismissing a consumer claim for want of jurisdiction
without first
giving a ruling as to its jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim.</i>
<P>

<i>(3)  If a tribunal has given a ruling under this section in respect of its
jurisdiction to hear and determine a consumer claim, it
must not determine the
claim:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)  until at least 14 days have elapsed since the day on which the ruling
was given, or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)  if, before it has determined the claim, it becomes aware that
proceedings for relief or a remedy of a kind mentioned in section
12 have been
instituted in a court in respect of the ruling - until those proceedings have
been concluded.</i>
<P>

11	The plaintiffs contend that at the outset of the hearing David and Michael
Khoury both claimed that they should not have been
joined in the proceedings
because they were not contracting parties with the first defendant, the sole
contracting party being, they
submitted, Mrs Khoury.  Having raised that point
the plaintiff's contend that the Referee failed to follow the procedure laid
down
by section 26 and merely overrode the objection.
<P>

12	The second ground is associated with section 32 of the Act which is in the
following terms:-
<P>

<i>Limitation on tribunal's jurisdiction to make orders</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	A tribunal has no jurisdiction to make in respect of a particular
consumer claim an order or orders in favour of the claimant
or, where there are
2 or more claimants, in favour of those claimants if the total of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the amount or amounts (if any) of money to be paid,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the value or values (if any) of the work to be performed, or the service
to be supplied,</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the amount or amounts (if any) of money to be declared not to be due or
owning, and</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the value or values of goods (if any) to be delivered or
replaced,</i>
<P>

<i>under or by virtue of the order or orders would exceed the prescribed
amount.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	A tribunal has no jurisdiction to make in respect of a particular
consumer claim an order or orders in favour of the respondent
to the claim, or
where there are 2 or more respondents to the claim, in favour of those
respondents if the amount or the total of
the amounts (if any) to be paid under
or by virtue of the order or orders would exceed the prescribed amount.</i>
<P>

13	For the purposes of section 32 the prescribed amount in relation to a
building claim is $25,000.  (See Regulation No 71 of 1994)
<P>

14	In this regard the plaintiffs contend that they submitted a cross-claim in
excess of $25,000 and informed the Referee that as
there was an excess over the
prescribed amount under section 32, the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear
the claim.
<P>

15	The plaintiffs also seek to rely in a more general way, upon what they
contend was an irregularity in the circumstances under
which the Referee's
decision was handed down.
<P>

16	Against that background it is relevant now to consider the evidence, which
was unfortunately incomplete in important respects,
tendered in this Court.
<P>

17	As I have already indicated the first hearing date was in September 1997.  A
second hearing by the Tribunal took place on a date
in October 1997 and a third
hearing, combined with a site inspection, took place on a later date in October
1997 and the final hearing
took place on 20 November 1997, when the Referee
reserved his decision.  It would appear that on each occasion the hearings were
relatively brief.  I shall refer at this stage, to the affidavit evidence which
was before me.  Mrs Khoury deposed that at the first
hearing she tried to tell
the Referee that she owned the property and she was the sole contracting party.
However, the Referee, she
contends, ignored her and only spoke to David Khoury.
She heard him say to David, "<i>You can't have a lawyer - you don't need one,
but you can have an interpreter</i>".  Mrs Khoury did not need an interpreter
but could not understand why her husband and son were involved in the
proceedings.  On
this occasion the Referee was informed that the plaintiff's
cross-claim was not finalised.  She said that did not seem to matter
because
the hearing only went for about an hour.
<P>

18	On the second occasion, she heard David say:<i> "We're claiming more than
$25,000</i>" and the Referee said:  <i>"You can't do that</i>."
<P>

19	At the site inspection she said to the Referee:  "<i>I want to stop the
case</i>."  She did not finish the sentence when the Referee said:  "<i>If
you're going</i> <i>to say anything I'll walk out</i>."  Thereafter she felt
embarrassed and said nothing more.
<P>

20	David Khoury deposed that, at the first hearing, he said that he did not
know why Michael and he were present.  He said that
the first defendant had an
interpreter but that none of the plaintiffs needed an interpreter. He did not
understand the legal nature
of the proceedings nor the way the case was
conducted.  He said that when asked by the Referee if he wished an interpreter,
he replied
"<i>No, I don't want an interpreter.  Michael and I are not owners
of the house and we didn't contract with Kassim.  My wife received
the quote
and it's her house</i>."  The Referee replied "<i>I'm not interested in that.
Do you have a cross-claim?</i>"  David replied "<i>Yes she does but it's not
ready today</i>."  The Referee responded "<i>Well I'll start with Mr Kassim's
claim</i>."  He then embarked upon the hearing of that claim, which lasted for
about one to one and a half hours.
<P>

21	At the next session, David Khoury presented the experts reports obtained by
the plaintiffs.  One was from a quantity surveyor
named Martin, and the other
was from "<i>Tyrells</i>."  David said to the Referee.  "<i>This claim is about
$30,000.  It is more than your jurisdiction and I want to stop the case and
take it to court</i>."  The Referee then said to Mr Kassim "<i>What do you
say</i>" and Mr Kassim replied through the interpreter "<i>I object to that
course</i>."  The Referee said "<i>You have to go on with the case.  I can only
give you a judgment on $25,000."</i>  David replied "<i>I only want to proceed
if you can give me the order I want."</i>
<P>

22	David said "<i>We did not walk out of the hearing</i>," because I did not
want the Referee to hear Mr Kassim's claim without my being present.  David
said "<i>I did not know what to do so we stayed in the hearing."</i>
<P>

23	David confirmed that at the site inspection Mrs Khoury said to the Referee
"I<i> want to stop our claim</i>."  The Referee pointed his finger at her and
said:  "<i>If you keep talking, I'll walk out."</i>
<P>

24	Michael Khoury deposed that at the first hearing he told the Referee that he
was neither the proprietor nor a contracting party.
 However, the Referee did
not seem to pay any attention to him or to what he said.  He said that when the
Referee asked about the
cross-claim, he stated <i>"I can't hear the case if
your claim is more than $25,000",</i> and his father replied "<i>Let's see what
happens - I don't have the report yet."</i>
<P>

25	Michael deposed that at the site inspection he heard his father say "<i>My
claim is more than $25,000 I want to go to court to fight this, you can't make
the order I want."</i>  The Referee replied "<i>Once I give a decision its
binding. If you're going to get out, do it now</i>."  Having said that,
however, the Referee continued to ask questions and hear the case.
<P>

26	In his affidavit Mr Kassim asserted that the Referee warned David Khoury
about the $25,000 limit and gave the plaintiffs the
option not to proceed with
the case but David did not raise any objection <i>"in relation to the
jurisdictional issue."</i>  Indeed he said words to the Referee to the effect.
"<i>It is OK go ahead</i>."
<P>

27	Mr Kassim said that Mrs Khoury kept interrupting the Referee with rude
comments addressed to Mr Kassim by saying things like
"<i>This man is stupid.";
"This man is dumb"</i>.  At one stage the Referee told Mrs Khoury words to the
effect "<i>Unless you stop interrupting I will walk out."</i>
<P>

28	Mr Kassim deposed, with regard to the contractual arrangements.  "I
contracted directly with Michael and [David] Khoury.  Mary
Khoury was the
decision maker.  Mary used to [say] things to the effect that, <i>"I am the
boss here and what I say goes.".</i>
<P>

29	On the fourth occasion the Referee heard some submissions from the parties,
read experts reports and reserved his decision.
<P>

30	I turn then to the oral evidence given by the various parties.  Mary Khoury
said in cross-examination that David and Michael
carried out the negotiations
with Mr Kassim because he ignored her.  She really knew nothing about the terms
of the contract.  It
was put to her in cross-examination, "<i>Let me put it to
you simply, did you at any stage think you had a contract to do the work
between yourself and builder</i>?"  Mrs Khoury answered "<i>No</i>."
<P>

31	In evidence David Khoury said that during the course of the building work he
had a heart attack necessitating a triple by-pass.
 He never met with the
builder on site.  He only spoke to him on his mobile phone.  After the full
contract sum had been paid, David
asked the builder several times to come and
rectify the defective work, which he refused to do.  
<P>

32	David reiterated his contention that he was not a party to the building
contract.  
<P>

33	David said that after receiving the claim form from the Building Disputes
Tribunal he discussed the matter with his solicitor
who told him that he could
not act for him before the Tribunal.  However, during the course of the
Tribunal hearing he remained in
contact with his solicitor and spoke to him at
the end of each hearing day.  He agreed that from the date of his solicitor's
letter
of 13 November 1996 to the builder's solicitor and the date of the
application to the Tribunal, namely 29 April 1997, he did not
do anything at
all relevant to his dissatisfaction with the building work.
<P>

34	Although this part of David's evidence is not fully reproduced on the
transcript, he did explain that he took no steps on "<i>humanitarian"</i>
grounds, meaning that he did not think it was right for him to sue a person of
the same ethnic background in a "<i>foreign country</i>".  This answer was
partly reproduced on transcript page 15 lines 39-41.  
<P>

35	Importantly David dealt with the fact that he continued with the cross-claim
in the Tribunal by asserting that he was "<i>forced by the Arbitrator</i>" to
do so, his contention being, that as the builder wished to proceed with the
case, the Referee indicated that he was going to
continue and, according to
David, this left him with no option but to remain in the Tribunal.
<P>

36	David explained his attitude in his own words as follows:
<P>

<i>"He asked me the question that I knew he can't go beyond $25,000.  Well he
said, "I am going to proceed with the case".  I don't know
one hundred percent
whether I can stop him or not.  I thought he got the power to carry on without
my consent over the limit so we
carried on and I said to him at the time does
not matter what outcome is I still have to take it to the court.  He said it in
his
judgment too.  He said it in his judgment, I object, then he said I have to
take the case to the court because he receive the instructions
from one side.
He did not attempt the right case, one to one case whichever, couldn't win.  I
object to the $25,000 to proceed with
the case which then claimant or plaintiff
wanted to proceed so I agree with him.  In that case I assume in my mind he is
doing something
bias.  I assume, I am not saying his is, so he deny the right
to someone and he grant right to another.  This I get it in my mind."
 </i>(Tpt
18)
<P>

37	Incidentally, David is a retired builder of many years experience.  He
agreed that he had negotiated terms of the contract with
the builder over three
meetings within the course of two weeks.
<P>

38	In evidence Michael Khoury reasserted his belief that the contract was
solely between the builder and his mother.  He said on
more than one occasion
"<i>Mum contracted with the builder.  I wasn't present, I don't know what went
on</i>."  He agreed in cross-examination that the Referee volunteered the
information and gave a warning that he could not hear the case
if the
cross-claim was more than $25,000.
<P>

39	Mr Kassim gave evidence that he is a licensed carpenter, joiner and roof
tiler.  He does not have a builder's licence.
<P>

40	Relevantly his evidence in relation to the negotiation of the contract is as
follows:
<P>

<i>Q	Mrs Khoury was on the site almost every day, wasn't she?</i>
<P>

<i>A	David.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Mary Khoury?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes, come every day.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And she was the decision maker, wasn't she?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Not really, she part of three.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	She used to say things like, "I am the boss here and what I say goes",
didn't she?</i>
<P>

<i>A	She said first time to the last time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	She said to you that she was the boss?</i>
<P>

<i>A	She said first time to the last time before we start and then at the end
of the job.  That's what I hearing, that she is the boss.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And was it to Mary that you gave the price to do the job?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Three together was in the unit somewhere, David, Michael and Mary.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Did Mrs Khoury tell you that she was the owner of the property?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No, not first time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	I suggest to you that she was the person who made the decisions about what
was going to happen on the job?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Mrs Khoury, all the family.  I know from three or four years before, I
deal with them.  Anyone I can deal with them, talk to David,
second time
Michael, first time Mary.  Everytime everyone make decision so I feel the home
owned by three, not by one.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Was it the case that you preferred to talk man to man with Mr Khoury
rather than talking to Mrs Khoury?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Mr Khoury, David?</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>A	I talk with him, he call me come and see the plans and come and see the
job but to deal with Michael because Michael architect,
he know how to explain
to you.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Michael gave you directions about how to actually do the building
work?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Michael give me directions and me and him work how to finish the job and
he is young, I am old in the building, so I give him and
me together, we talk
about how to do it this job, change this one, change this one, we did it with
Michael.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Did you feel more comfortable talking to David Khoury than Mrs
Khoury?</i>
<P>

<i>A	I feel comfortable to talk with all the family.  I like these people, I
didn't feel one better than the other one.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Michael Khoury talked to you about the building design, didn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	He talked about the plan?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes, about the plan and also I give him a look for the plan, how to change
this one.  We talk frankly, I know him before.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	But Mrs Khoury made the decisions, didn't she, about the work that was to
be done?</i>
<P>

<i>A	I don't think so because the report for the work, I hear from David, from
Michael, from David Khoury always when he talk to him,
David talked to my
friend, he know about the plan.  This is more better you than me.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Have a look at paragraph 12 of your affidavit, the second page near the
top?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Do you see (a)?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Read that to yourself for the moment?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	You say in that paragraph that Mary Khoury was the decision maker.  Mary
used to say things to the effect that, I am the boss here
and what I say goes".
That's right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes, she say, "I am boss for the pay the money", and she kick me out,
don't want to talk to me when I finish the job.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Did you say she is the boss for paying the money?</i>
<P>

<i>A	I couldn't control wages for me, when we start deal with me and by time
change, every time this change talking, everytime.  I can't
tell you exactly,
this first time it was Mrs Mary, she is the boss.  Second time everyone say
Michael the boss.  Before I finish
the job Mr David the boss and before I
finish Mr David and Mr Michael refer to me, "we are nothing here, you talk to
my mother and
my wife because she is the boss".  That is all I know about this
family.</i>
<P>

41	He said later that he believed that all three were contracting parties.
With regard to the question of the plaintiffs cross-claim
exceeding $25,000 Mr
Kassim gave the following evidence under cross-examination:-
<P>

<i>Q	And Mr Khoury said to the referee that his claim was about $30,000 and he
wanted to go to court?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Not second time, third time site hearing.  He said at site hearing first
time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	You remember, I am staying with the second time at the moment, you heard
the referee say that he could only make a decision up to
$25,000, didn't
he?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And he told Mr Khoury that, didn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And Mr Khoury said, "I want to go to court", and the referee asked you
what your attitude to that was?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Mr Khoury said something but my claim is less than $25,000, his case is
$25, not over 25.  Mr Khoury not say for the referee because
this matter, for
the other matter.  He said, "I want to go to the court, I want him to lose
house", something different, not in the
question.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	You say it wasn't because of the $25,000?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No.  When referee said 25,000 and over 25 is not here, so Mr David Khoury
doesn't answer.  He answer later on about something else.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	But at some point he said he wanted to go to court?</i>
<P>

<i>A	He wanted to do something bad for me.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	I suggest to you he said, "My claim is about thirty thousand, it is more
than your jurisdiction.  I want to stop the case and take
it to court"?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No, not second hearing.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And the referee asked you what you thought and you said, "I object to
that", and the referee said, "Well, you have to go on with
the case".</i>
<P>

<i>A	No, I don't hear anything for the second hearing.  For the third hearing I
somebody.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	At the third hearing, that was the one on site?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And on that occasion Mr Khoury said he wanted to go to court, didn't
he?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	He or Mrs Khoury said, "I want to stop the claim and go to court"?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Mr Khoury say.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	And the referee said, "You can't do that"?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No, he didn't say it this way.  He said, "You can't do it but we now
already done three times.  If you want to stop it you can.
 You want to carry
on, we carry on".  Mr Khoury said, "All right, carry on", that's all he saying
there, that's what happened exactly.</i>
<P>

42	The Referee reserved his decision on 20 November 1997.  On 8 July 1998
Michael Khoury received a letter from the Registrar, Consumer
Claims Tribunals,
in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"I refer to a claim you have lodged with this Tribunal and which was last
heard on 20 November 1997 before referee Mr Vardas.</i>
<P>

<i>As you are aware this matter was reserved for a decision at that
time.</i>
<P>

<i>As Mr Vardas is now overseas and his return date is unknown, the matter has
been re-listed before another referee for rehearing.</i>
<P>

<i>I apologise for any inconvenience this situation has caused.</i>
<P>

<i>In order to finalise these proceedings as soon as possible could you please
ensure you bring all documentation and /or witnesses.</i>
<P>

<i>Your hearing notice is attached."</i>
<P>

43	The hearing notice which was attached to the letter was again addressed to
each of the plaintiffs and specified a hearing date
of 4 August 1998.  (No
evidence was led before me as to what transpired on 4 August 1998).
<P>

44	On 22 July 1998 Messrs Photios Vouroudis &amp; Co wrote to the Registrar on
behalf of the plaintiffs in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"We act for Michael, Mary and Deeb (David) Khoury, who have handed to us
your letter dated 8 July 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>We are instructed by our client that this matter was heard over a matter of
four (4) days between September 1997 and November 1997,
which included a view
of our client's property.</i>
<P>

<i>Further, our client's incurred costs in the order of Three Thousand Four
Hundred dollars ($3,400.00) to present expert evidence and
have witnesses
available for cross examination.</i>
<P>

<i>We are also instructed that our client has filed a Cross-Claim seeking
recovery of approximately Twenty Eight Thousand dollars ($28,000.00)
which we
respectfully submit places this matter outside the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal.</i>
<P>

<i>In these circumstances, our client objects to the matter proceeding for a
rehearing and intends to initiate civil proceedings through
the Local Court at
Burwood.</i>
<P>

<i>Kindly confirm that the hearing date of the 4 August 1998 is now
vacated".</i>
<P>

45	The Registrar did not reply to that letter, but thereafter forwarded a
document entitled "<i>Notice of Order'</i> addressed to David Khoury stating
that: 
<P>

<i> "At Hurstville on 24 August 1998 the following reserved decision was
made:</i>
<P>

<i>I order that the respondents pay to the claimant the sum of $7,500 within
one month".</i>
<P>

46	Annexed to that notice was the undated reserved decision of Referee
Vardas.
<P>

<i>The amount of $7,500 was calculated by the Referee as follows:-

<P>

<i>Thus the Referee made an order against all the respondents within the
meaning of s.30(1)(a) of the Act which was capable of enforcement
under the
provisions of Division 4 of the Act.</i>
<P>

47	The Referee's reasons, which occupied some 5&#188; pages, made no reference
to the issue of the identity of the parties to the
oral contract for the
building work.  However, it contained the following observations under the
subheading "<i>Jurisdiction</i>".
<P>

<b><cite>Jurisdiction</cite></b>
<P>

<i>At the initial hearing of this matter the respondents were granted leave to
bring a cross-claim, as it were, against the claimant.
 This was presented
through two separate bills of quantities prepared for the respondent.</i>
<P>

<i>At the onsite hearing David Khoury stated that he had previously misread the
way in which his quantity surveyor had compiled the reports
and that it
appeared to him that his cross-claim was greatly in excess of the
jurisdictional limit of this Tribunal.  At that point
I indicated to Mr Khoury
that he ought to consider his position carefully given that if I was to make an
order in his favour I could
not award more than $25,000.</i>
<P>

<i>At the subsequent (and final) hearing of the matter, I again addressed this
problem with the parties and explained that depending
on my view as to the
prospects of success of the cross-claim I could decline to hear the matter
thereby allowing the parties to litigate
their dispute in a court.  Mr Khoury
responded that he wished the matter to proceed and that he understood the
jurisdictional limitations
imposed upon this Tribunal and that he was prepared
to abide by any determination made by the Tribunal.</i>
<P>

48	The Referee returned to this matter later in his decision under the
subheading "<i>on site inspection" </i>in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>On site inspection</i>
<P>

<i>On 24 October 1997 I attended at the respondents' house to conduct an onsite
hearing and inspection. At the outset, Mr David Khoury
said to me that he had
been advised by his loss assessor that his total damage now exceeded the
jurisdictional limits of the Tribunal
and that he wanted the matter to be heard
by a court.  At that point he handed to me a second loss assessor's report
(referred to
earlier) which sought to clarify the claim for damages.</i>
<P>

<i>I indicated to Mr Kassim in the presence of the interpreter that Mr Khoury
was seeking to have the matter re-litigated in a court
because potentially his
cross-claim exceeded the jurisdiction in the Tribunal.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Kassim responded that it was his claim and that he wanted the matter
finalised by the Tribunal.</i>
<P>

<i>I then discussed the matter with the parties and pointed out that if both
the claim and cross-claim were to proceed in a court it
would take longer and
be more expensive in terms of legal costs and that I would have to be satisfied
that Mr Khoury had reasonable
prospects of recovering close to the amount that
he now claims to have suffered as a loss arising out of the building works.  As
I indicted earlier in this judgment, Mr David Khoury agreed to have the matter
determined by the Tribunal.</i>
<P>

49	I note that when dealing with the "<i>respondents reply and
cross-claim</i>", the Referee said:
<P>

<i>"At times Mr David Khoury became quite emotional about the defence of this
claim and it would be fair to say that, in summary, the
respondent's case is
that the claim for variations bought by Mr Kassim has been fabricated and that
indeed Mr Kassim is guilty of
defective and incomplete workmanship in
circumstances where the respondents are entitled to set up and rely on a
cross-claim for
an amount potentially exceeding the jurisdictional limit of
this Tribunal."</i>
<P>

50	The Referee then went on to deal with the cross-claim.  It is apparent from
what has been stated earlier in this judgment, that
although the cross-claim
exceeded $25,000, the respondents succeeded only to the extent of $5,000.  On
the other hand the variations
claimed by the builder amounting to $19,935 were
reduced by the Referee to $11,500.  
<P>

51	I must confess that I have found the resolution of this matter to be an
extremely troublesome one.  The matter has been complicated
by the difficulty
of witnesses before me attempting to express themselves accurately in English,
which is not their first language.
 Regrettably, but not uncommonly in disputes
about the family home, the matter has now developed a very strong emotional
overlay.
 A recent example of how disputes about the family home can get out of
hand is to be found in the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in <b>Sweeney &amp;
Anor v Coffey Pty Ltd</b><i> </i><b>&amp; Anors</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 38</a>
(unreported, 16 February 1999).  
<P>

52	Section 17 (1) of the Act provides that: 
<P>

<i> "Except as expressly provided by this Act or the regulations, a tribunal
has control of and responsibility for its own procedures,
but in exercising its
functions under this Act must conform to the rules of natural justice."</i>
<P>

53	The tension between the intention of the legislature in providing what is
intended to be speedy, inexpensive and informal procedures
for the resolution
of relatively small disputes on the one hand and the need for the Tribunal to
conform to the rules of natural
justice on the other hand has been the subject
of judicial comment on a number of occasions.
<P>

54	I take the opportunity of repeating in this regard the remarks of Simpson J
in<b><i> </i>Archcom Pty Limited v Consumer Claims Tribunal</b><i>
</i>(unreported 29 September 1995) where her Honour said (at pages 12-14):
<P>

<i>"Underpinning the Act is a policy of providing expeditious access to an
inexpensive and informal process for the resolution of consumer
disputes
involving relatively small amounts of money.  Speed and economy are to be
accompanied, and (it is hoped) often achieved,
by informality.
...................................... </i>
<P>

<i>The intention of the legislature, in creating these tribunals as a forum for
the resolution of disputes involving relatively small
amounts of money was the
achievement of expeditious and inexpensive justice between the parties while
maintaining a proper regard
for, and protection of, the rights of the parties
to the dispute.  The difficulty, as I see it, lies in striking the correct
balance
between those two goals.  Speedy and inexpensive solutions may be
inimical to the protection of rights.  There is no necessary relationship
between the factual or legal complexity and the quantum of a claim but legal
rights and obligations remain at the heart of the tribunal's
jurisdiction.
Although a tribunal is enjoined to make such orders as will, in its opinion, be
fair and equitable to all parties to
the claim (s31(1)), those orders must be
grounded in legal liability: <b> Fairey Australia Pty Limited v Joyce</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 314</a>;  <b>White v Hall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20ASC%2055%2d247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) ASC 55-247</a>, <b>State Rail</b>

<P>

55	Reference should also be made to the judgment of Graham AJ in <b>Fintron Pty
Limited v The Registrar, Consumer Claims Tribunals &amp; Ors</b> (unreported,
16 December 1997) where observations of a similar nature are made and which
also contains a reference to <b>Archcom</b>.
<P>

56	It is inevitable that questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact
will arise in matters before the Building Disputes
Tribunal.  This can impose a
difficult burden upon a Referee who has no legal qualifications and who has
parties before him or her
who are disentitled to legal representation.  If a
pure question of law or a mixed question of law and fact arises during the
course
of a hearing, however, it becomes necessary for the Referee to identify
the point, hear submissions from the parties with regard
to it, and provide
them with a decision on the question.  
<P>

57	I am quite satisfied that the present plaintiffs clearly raised before
Referee Vardas the issue of who precisely were the parties
to the building
contract.  David and Michael Khoury clearly enough contended that the sole
contractor on the owner's side was Mrs
Khoury.  Somewhat remarkably, it may be
thought, in evidence before me, she denied that she at any stage thought that
she had a contract
with the builder.  I have a suspicion that Mrs Khoury did
not quite appreciate the full impact of what was fairly being put to her
in
that question.  However, for present purposes I do not think that anything
really turns on that.  The question of who the parties
to the contract were,
was clearly raised before the Referee and the parties before him were entitled
to a ruling thereon.  
<P>

58	I have no hesitation in saying, by reason of the confused evidence which was
given before me, that the Referee would not have
found that question an easy
one to resolve.  However, it was obligatory upon him to resolve the question
before he made orders under
section 31 against each of the respondents, thereby
subjecting them to the enforcement provisions in Division 4 of the Act. 
<P>

59	Section 26 of the Act which has been quoted above sets out the procedure to
be followed when a Tribunal's jurisdiction is disputed.
 
<P>

60	It is necessary now to address the question whether the plaintiffs
<u>disputed the jurisdiction of the Tribunal</u> within the meaning of s 26
with regard to the claim against David and Michael.  It is necessary,
therefore, to turn to the relevant
provisions of the Act dealing with a
building claim.  Section 10(1) provides:
<P>

<i>"Subject to this Act, a Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
</i><cite>consumer claim</cite><i> referred to it in accordance with this
Act."</i>
<P>

61	Relevantly, section 3(1) defines `consumer claim' to mean:
<P>

<i>"(a)  a claim by a consumer for the payment of a specified sum of
money,.........   that arises from a supply of goods or services
by a supplier
to a consumer, whether under a contract or not, or that arises under a contract
that is collateral to a contract for
the supply of goods or services."</i>
<P>

62	Now s 12A(1) which is included in Part 3A `Building claims and rectification
orders' provides that in this Part: 
<P>

<i> `Building claim' means a claim for:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)  the payment of a specified sum of money,</i>
<P>

<i>.......that arises from a supply of building goods or services whether under
a contract or not, or that arises under a contract that
is collateral to a
contract for the supply of building goods or services."</i>
<P>

63	Section 12B (relevantly) provides that:
<P>

<i>""For the purposes of the Act, a building claim is to be considered to be a
consumer claim and a person who makes a a building claim
is to be considered to
be a consumer:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	despite the definitions of consumer and consumer  claim in s   3(1),
and</i>
<P>

<i>	    (b)	even when the claim is made by a supplier."</i>
<P>

64	Thus, in the instant case the question whether the Building Disputes
Tribunal had jurisdiction over David and/or Michael (who
protested
jurisdiction) would depend upon whether the first defendant had a claim against
them for the payment of a specified sum
arising from a supply of building goods
or services arising under a contract, or otherwise.  They contended that they
were not parties
to any contract with the first defendant.  
<P>

65	As to the second alternative, the question would arise here as to whether in
the absence of any contractual liability, there
was nevertheless a legal
liability such as a liability under a relevant statute or by tort:  See
<b>Fairey Australasia Pty Ltd v Joyce</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 NSWLR 314</a> at 321 where
Yeldham J said:
<P>

<i>"It is, of course, plain that the person against whom an order is made must
be one who has a legal liability to the consumer.  The
Act is not concerned
with `Palm tree justice'."</i>
<P>

Thus I am satisfied that David and Michael disputed the 
<P>

jurisdiction  of the Tribunal within the meaning of s 26.
<P>

66	However, the question of jurisdiction was not addressed at all by the
Referee and accordingly no ruling was given under s 26(1).
<P>

67	There is insufficient evidence before me to determine whether the Tribunal
did <u>in fact</u> have jurisdiction to make orders against David and Michael.
The grievance which those two plaintiffs have is that the Tribunal erred
in
refusing or failing to give a ruling after its jurisdiction was disputed.  If
the ruling had been given and was adverse to the
plaintiffs, then they could
have sought judicial review under s 12.
<P>

68	Section 12 of the Act is in the following terms:-
<P>

<b><i>Tribunal to be immune from judicial review</i></b>
<P>

<i>(1)	Except as provided by subsection (2), a court of record has no
jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari
or other prerogative writ,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a declaratory judgment or order, or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	an injunction,</i>
<P>

<i>in respect of a consumer claim heard and determined or to be heard or
determined by a tribunal in accordance with this Act or in respect
of any
ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such claim.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) if, in respect of a consumer
claim:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a tribunal has given a ruling under section 26 or refused or failed to
give such a ruling after the jurisdiction of the tribunal
to hear and determine
the claim has been disputed by a party to the claim and the ground on which the
relief or remedy is sought
is that:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the ruling was erroneous, or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the tribunal erred in refusing or failing to give the ruling after its
jurisdiction was disputed, or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a tribunal has made an order under section 30 and the ground on which
the relief or remedy is sought is that:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	in relation to the hearing or determination of the claim, a party to
the claim had been denied natural justice.</i>
<P>

69	I am of the view, therefore, that this Court is not precluded from granting
relief or a remedy of the kind referred to in subsection
12(1) because the
Tribunal failed to give a ruling under section 26 after the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to hear and determine
the claim against David and Michael Khoury was
disputed:  See s. 26(2) (a) (ii).
<P>

70	I turn then to the second major leg of the plaintiffs case which relates to
the limitation on a Tribunal's jurisdiction to make
orders pursuant to section
32 of the Act, the terms of which I have set out above.  It is important to
note, at the outset, that
section 32 does not provide that no claim or
cross-claim may be lodged with the Tribunal which exceeds the prescribed amount
(here
$25,000), but rather that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to make an
order in favour of either the claimant or the respondent which
exceeds $25,000.
See <b>Hales v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ASC%2055%2d975" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ASC 55-975</a>;
<b>Sandford v Marjen Building Contractors Pty Ltd &amp; Ors </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20ASC%2056%2d148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) ASC
56-148.</a>  It is thus to be distinguished from, for example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District
Court Act 1973</a> as amended.  
<P>

71	Thus in the instant case, the Referee had jurisdiction to hear both the
original claim and the cross-claim (albeit that it exceeded
$25,000) subject to
the limitation that having balanced the amount allowed under the claim, as
against the amount allowed under the
cross-claim, there could not be a net
order which exceeded $25,000.  This, I think, was what the Referee had in mind
when he said
in his reserved decision:
<P>

<i>"At the subsequent (and final) hearing of the matter, I again addressed this
problem with the parties, and explained that depending
on my view as to the
prospects of the success of the cross-claim I could decline to hear the matter
thereby allowing the parties
to litigate their dispute in a court."</i>
<P>

72	The Referee was faced with a difficult situation in the hearing before him
in that unquestionably Mr Kassim wished to proceed
with his claim, whereas the
plaintiffs did not wish to proceed with the cross-claim; they wished for both
matters to be litigated
in the Local Court.  However, they faced the dilemma
that if the Referee continued to hear the builder's claim they would suffer
what they perceived to be, a serious tactical disadvantage by withdrawing their
cross-claim and commencing their own proceedings
in the Local Court.  In
essence this is why I consider that Mr David Khoury reluctantly agreed to the
whole matter continuing before
the Referee 
<P>

73	It should be noted in this context that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> provides:
<P>

<i>"At any time before a tribunal has finally completed its hearing of a
consumer claim and before the tribunal has begun its determination
of the
claim, the claimant may withdraw the claim."</i>
<P>

74	The evidence fails to satisfy me that at any stage prior to the Referee
reserving his decision on the fourth and final hearing
date, the plaintiffs
withdrew the cross-claim within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16.</a>  However, the matter
does not end there because a nice question arises as to whether the letter
dated 22 July 1998 from Photios Vouroudis
&amp; Co, to the Registrar of the
Consumer Claims Tribunals, constituted a withdrawal of the cross-claim within
the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16.</a> 
<P>

75	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> raises difficult questions of construction.  As the final
completion of the hearing of a claim must necessarily occur at an earlier
time
than the beginning of the determination of the claim, it is difficult to
discern the legislature's intention in specifying that
that withdrawal must
occur prior to <u>both</u> the specified events occurring.  Perhaps the
legislature may have been concerned that there could have been an overlapping
between
the completion of the hearing and the beginning of the determination
and wished to ensure that there could be no withdrawal after
the hearing had
been completed or after the determination had begun.
<P>

76	In the instant case the plaintiffs, in effect, sought to withdraw the
cross-claim after the hearing had been completed but before
the claim had been
determined.  I would doubt that this purported withdrawal would satisfy the
terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16.</a>  In any event it is not a matter upon which I heard argument.
<P>

77	The matter is complicated in this case by reason of the letter dated 8 July
1998 from the Registrar of the Consumer Claims Tribunals
and the "<i>Notice of
Hearing/Relisting</i>" of the matter.  The question arises as to the legal
effect within the terms of the Act of the listing of the matter before another
Referee.  
<P>

78	The Registrar stated in the letter dated 8 July 1998, <i>that "the matter
has been relisted before another Referee for rehearing</i>".  That means, of
course, that a new Tribunal must have been constituted pursuant to the
provisions of section 5 of the Act.  This
fresh Tribunal must have been
constituted by the senior Referee [see subsection 5(2)].  A question then
arises as to whether the
original Tribunal constituted by Mr Vardas had
necessarily been disbanded and divested of authority to resolve the matter.

<P>

79	Section 18(4) provides that if the hearing of a consumer claim by a Tribunal
is before the Tribunal has determined the claim,
interrupted by the incapacity
or vacation of office of the referee who constitutes the Tribunal, the senior
referee must, if the
claimant wishes to proceed with the claim, make
arrangements for the hearing and determination of the claim to be recommenced
before
a Tribunal constituted by another referee.  I assume that the senior
referee was discharging his or her responsibilities under s
18(4) when he or
she set-up the new Tribunal in the present case.
<P>

80	As I have indicated there is no evidence before me as to what happened at
9.00am on 4 August 1998 at Level 4, 4-8 Woodville Street
Hurstville, the date
and place for the fresh hearing of the claim.  Nor have I had the benefit of
the relevant Tribunal files and
the Referee's notes being tendered in
evidence.
<P>

81	The crucial matter, it seems to me, is that the plaintiffs were entitled to
a response to their solicitors' letter dated 22 July
1998 bearing in mind their
expressed concern about the cross-claim and the notification of re-listing.
They were entitled to have
their legal position clarified in this regard.
However, they received no response or opportunity to be heard.  In lieu thereof
they
had imposed upon them, without explanation, an adverse decision of
questionable validity.  This irregular course of affairs would
inevitably leave
them with a justifiable sense of grievance.  
<P>

82	Ms Olsson for the plaintiffs submitted that the intervention of this Court
was justified by the concatenation of circumstances
associated with the hearing
which, she submitted constituted a denial of natural justice to the
plaintiffs.
<P>

83	I am persuaded that this is the correct view.  The plaintiffs are entitled
to believe that they had not had "<i>a fair deal" </i>to use the expression of
Lord Denning MR in <b>Performance Cars Limited v Secretary for State of the
Environment</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2034%20P%20%26%20CR%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 34 P.&amp;C.R. 92</a> at 97 or <i>"a fair crack of the whip"
</i>to use the more picturesque expression of Lord Russell of Killowen in
<b>Fairmount Investments v Secretary of State </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20ALL%20ER%20865" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 2 ALL ER 865</a> at 874
<P>

84	No discretionary considerations lead me to a contrary view.  
<P>

85	Accordingly I order that the Tribunal's decision and order of 24 August 1998
are quashed.  I shall give the parties the opportunity
to make submissions on
costs in the light of this judgment.  
<P>
