<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> These reasons relate to the admissibility of documents
tendered by the plaintiff's counsel on the basis that they are business
records.
<P>

2	These proceedings were commenced by Summons on 10 December 1996.  As they
were commenced by Summons each party's evidence-in-chief
should be given on
affidavit. There are now pleadings; Statement of Claim of 3 February 1998 and
Defences by each defendant, and
the issues are complex.  The first, second,
third and fourth defendants filed appearances, and they were formerly
represented by
solicitors but have not been since 6 July 1998.  The fifth
defendant filed an appearance in person on 14 April 1999.  The hearing
commenced on 28 April 1999 and continued on 29 April 1999; the first and second
defendants did not appear at the hearing and I am
informed that they are
serving sentences of imprisonment.  The third, fourth and fifth defendants
appeared in person.  It was evident
when they spoke that they were able to
speak some English but very little.  I found it very difficult to understand
what they said,
and when they did say something I understood it was not always
in point.  They had the assistance of Mr Danny Mato, who told me that
he is the
son of the third and fourth defendants.  What they did say made it clear to me
that they oppose the plaintiff's claims
against them.  The hearing is
proceeding on the issues raised by the pleadings.  
<P>

3	The practice of the Court in giving assistance to unrepresented litigants
appears from observations in <b>Rajski v Scitec Corporation Pty Limited</b>,
(Court of Appeal unreported 16 June 1986.  Samuels JA said:
<P>

	<i>"In my view, the advice and assistance which a litigant in person ought to
receive from the Court should be limited to that which
is necessary to
diminish, so far as this is possible, the disadvantage which he or she will
ordinarily suffer when faced by a lawyer,
and to prevent destruction from the
traps which our adversary procedure offers to the unwary and untutored.  But
the Court should
be astute to see that it does not extend its auxiliary role so
as to confer upon a litigant in person a positive advantage over the
represented opponent.  In these days of reasonably available legal aid, a
litigant in person is becoming increasingly uncommon. 
At all events the
absence of legal representation on one side ought not to induce the Court to
deprive the other side of one jot
of its lawful entitlement.  It may add weight
on the unrepresented party's side of the scale; it must not lighten the
other".</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The availability of legal aid has lessened since 1986.
<P>

4	In the course of his judgment Mahoney JA said:
<P>

	<i>"What steps will be appropriate, in a particular case, to prevent injustice
being done to parties who find themselves involved in
litigation conducted in
this way, must, of course, be determined in the light of the facts of that
case: but it should be clear that
it is proper that steps be taken to that
end."</i>
<P>

5	Illustrations of the practice appear in the judgments of McLelland J in
<b>Tardy v The Secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health</b>
(9 October 1990 unreported) and in <b>Studer v Konig</b> (4 June 1993
unreported).  In <b>Marriage of Johnson</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20139%20FLR%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 139 FLR 384</a> the Full Court
of the Family Court of Australia established for that Court a more prescriptive
practice in which it is an obligation
of the trial Judge: 
<P>

	<i>"If evidence is sought to be tendered which is or may be inadmissible, to
advise him or her of the right to object to inadmissible
material, and to
inquire whether he or she so objects....."  </i>Page 407.
<P>

6	No authority confines a primary Judge of the Supreme Court in this way.
Their Honours gave further references to authority, in
New South Wales and
elsewhere.  Of course, it is for the Family Court of Australia to establish its
own practice on that matter;
in the Supreme Court of New South Wales the extent
of intervention remains discretionary.  I see this tender as an occasion where
I should intervene and attribute an objection to the defendants.
<P>

7	To explain the evidence ruling I will give a short statement of the nature of
the claim.  I am not yet in a position to find any
fact, except for the limited
purposes of an evidence ruling.
<P>

8	On 17 and 18 June 1996 the first defendant Monica Rusu was employed by the
plaintiff, and for over a year she had been a member
of the staff at its branch
at 138 Queen Street, Campbelltown.  Ms Rusu knew a code number which had to be
used to open one of two
combination locks on the safe; one group of staff
members knew one code number and another group knew the other, so that two
persons
had to work together to lock and to unlock the safe.  The bank's case
is that Ms Rusu stole $476,500 in bank notes from the safe.
 This case is based
on evidence of circumstances and opportunity to the effect that if one of the
two locks on the safe was closed
in a certain way it could be opened again by a
person who only knew the code for the other, that Ms Rusu stayed at the
premises after
all others left, and that a computer record kept by the security
company shows that the safe was opened for a short time soon after
the others
left.  I am told that other evidence will show that the second defendant Peter
Francis Mato attended at the bank premises
to pick her up after work, and that
they had significant amounts of funds available to them soon afterwards, in
contrast to their
resources before.  
<P>

9	The bank makes claims against the first and second defendants based on the
allegation that they stole the bank's money, and claims
to be entitled to
charges over property which they own by tracing the bank's money into the
property.  The bank also makes various
claims against the third, fourth and
fifth defendants, to the effect that they have incurred personal liabilities
and that property
which they own is subject to charges in favour of the bank
arising out of knowing receipt and dishonest dealings with money owned
by the
bank.  
<P>

10	As one step in what I expect will be a very elaborate body of evidence in
support of its case the bank's counsel has tendered
pages 25 and 26 of Exhibit
SEG3.  These appear on their face to be pages 1 and 2 of a transaction history
inquiry relating to an
Account No. 146459720, and internal material in those
pages is obviously appropriate for them to be bank statements.  The pages do
not identify the bank or the customer.  Other documents at pages 14 to 29
inclusive of Exhibit SEG2 are tendered to show what pages
25 and 26 refer to
and to support their admissibility.
<P>

11	Ms Simone Emma Gilbert is a solicitor in the office of the solicitors who
represent the Bank.  Annexure A to the Affidavit of
Ms Gilbert sworn 23 April
1999 is a Schedule of payments which, according to Ms Gilbert's analysis of
documents produced on subpoena
by various persons and companies, were made by
the first and second defendants after 17 June 1996. 
<P>

12	Item 1 in the Schedule contains statements to the effect that on 18 June
1996 the second defendant paid Advance Bank $2,850 cash,
and bases this on
documents produced under subpoena by Advance Bank Australia Limited.
<P>

13	The second defendant is the defendant most directly affected by Item 1.  He
was not present at the hearing and I was told that
he was in prison.
Procedural law is applied strictly in hearings which occur in the absence of a
party.  For the defendants who appear
I am not able to make the assumption upon
which Courts act when parties are represented that evidence which may be
inadmissible is
deliberately allowed to be admitted unless an objection is
taken.  Of course these defendants have not said that they object to any
particular passages of evidence; they are not able to do so, either in
understanding or in power of language.  They have not equipped
themselves with
such obviously necessary aids as legal representation or a skilled interpreter.
They have taken a generally oppositional
position and I do not think that I
should disregard questions of the admissibility of evidence when I perceive
them.  
<P>

14	A difficulty for the tender of pages 25 and 26 to prove the facts in Item 1
is that in the analysis Item 1 states that it was
the second defendant who paid
$2,850 in cash into his own bank account on the day after the theft from the
bank; whereas nothing
on pages 25 or 26 or in the associated documents
identifies the second defendant himself as the person who made the cash
deposit.
 Evidence elsewhere suggests that he conducted a concrete haulage
business; he may well have had $2,850 in cash available to pay
into his bank
account from the business or from some other source, or it may well have been
someone else who paid it in.  The plaintiff's
counsel told me that he expected
that when evidence about Item 1 is taken with other transactions it will form
part of a pattern
which will support his case.  If admitted the evidence about
the deposit of $2,850 will need to be supplemented in some such way
or by other
material if it is ever to have any real significance.  On its own it will not
support the analysis in Item 1.  
<P>

15	Tender of pages 25 and 26 appears to me to raise a question of their
authentication; that is whether there is evidence that they
truly are what
counsel alleges they are; that is copies of bank statements which record
dealings between the second defendant and
the Advance Bank.  No witness from
the Advance Bank and no other witness has said in oral evidence or on affidavit
that that is what
they are.
<P>

16	The plaintiff's counsel asked me to find that the documents tendered are
bank statements of the Advance Bank relating to an account
conducted by the
second defendant, on the basis of the contents of those documents and on some
other documents which show the manner
in which pages 25 and 26 come to be
available.
<P>

17	Before a business record or any other document is admitted in evidence it is
obviously necessary that there should be an evidentiary
basis for finding that
it is what it purports to be. Documents are not ordinarily taken to prove
themselves or accepted as what they
purport to be; there are exceptions under
the Common Law and under statutes for public registers and for many kinds of
documents
when certified in various ways: and see the method of proof provided
in some cases by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s170.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 170</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s171.html" class="autolink_findacts">171</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  At the simplest, the
authenticity of a document may be proved by the evidence of the person who made
it or one of the persons who
made it, or a person who was present when it was
made, or in the case of a business record, a person who participates in the
conduct
of the business and compiled the document, or found it among the
business's records, or can recognise it as one of the records of
the business.

<P>

18	In Equity and Commercial litigation proof of the authenticity of business
documents does not often claim attention because practices
are followed which
limit the occasions when it needs attention.  The authenticity of documents is
often established in accordance
with Rules of Court for documents which have
been subject of Discovery (Pt. 18 r.4) or of Notices to Admit their
authenticity (Form
22), or where counsel against whom a document is tendered
has reasons to accept its authenticity, and decides not to object to its
tender.  These practices have not been followed here as the Advance Bank has
not been involved in Discovery, the defendants are unrepresented
and there has
been no Notice to Admit Facts and Authenticity of Documents. There has in
reality been no opportunity for the defendants
to consider what course they
should take.  Ms Gilbert's affidavit with its voluminous schedules was sworn
only five days  before
the hearing began; I do not know when it was served on
the defendants, but it cannot have been served on them in sufficient time
before the hearing for any advantage to be gained from reading it.  The
supporting documents Exhibits SEG-1 to SEG-7, seven large
volumes, were not
available until produced at the hearing, and a glance at them would suggest
that it would take some days for a
skilled lawyer to study them and grasp their
significance.  
<P>

19	It is necessary to establish by evidence other than by pages 25 and 26 the
facts that pages 25 and 26 are a bank statement, they
are a statement of the
Advance Bank and that the account to which they refer is an account of the
second defendant.  In effect counsel
asked me to assume that pages 25 and 26
are relevant and assured me that he would make them relevant.  I accept this
assurance and
my concerns about admissibility of pages 25 and 26 do not relate
to their relevance; they would be relevant if they are authentic.
 If counsel's
assurance had already been made good it would be possible, at discretion, to
admit the documents provisionally under
subs. 57(1)(b).  However that stage has
not been reached.  In the language used in subs. 57(1), a finding that the
evidence is what
the party claims it to be is distinguished from the question
whether the evidence is relevant; authenticity is something on which
relevance
depends.  (Justice Smith saw authenticity as an aspect of relevance in his
Honour's Article "<i>The More Things Change the More They Stay The Same?  The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> - An Overview</i>" 1995 UNSW Law Journals at 13:  I see them
as distinguished to some degree for this purpose.)  As counsel's assurance has
not been
made good, I have not reached the point where the documents could be
provisionally admitted.  In my opinion, a question of authenticity
is not a
question as to the relevance of documents within subs. 58(1), which treats
authenticity as part of the material on which
relevance may be determined.
<P>

<b>20	</b>The record at page 25 <i>"180696...cash deposit $2,850</i>..." is a
previous representation as defined in the dictionary to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.
Evidence of a previous representation is not admissible to prove the facts
asserted:  see subs 59 (1); but <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69</a> creates an exception for business records
and subs 69(1) relates to authentication.. <b> </b>
<P>

<b>	</b><i>"69 (1)  This section applies to a document that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	either:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)  is or forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body
or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes
of, a business, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)  at any time was or formed part of such a record, and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in
the course of, or for the purposes of, the business.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains
the representation) if the representation was made:</i>

<P>

<i>	(b)	on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person

knowledge of the

<P>

21	If pages 25 and 26 are to be admitted the plaintiff must show (and I
abbreviate <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69):</a>

22	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 48(1)(b):</a>
<P>

	<i>"A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question by
tendering the document in question or by any one or more
of the following
methods:</i>
<P>

<i>	........</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  tendering a document that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)  is or purports to be a copy of the document in question;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)  has been produced or purports to have been produced, by a device that

<P>

<i>	(e)	tendering a document that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	forms part of the records of or kept by a business (whether or not the
business is still in existence),  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	is or purports to be a copy of, or an extract from or a summary of,
the document in question, or is or purports to be a copy
of such an extract or
summary.".</i>
<P>

23	"<i>Document in question" </i>is a document as to the contents of which it
is sought to adduce evidence; see sub-section 47(1).  Pages 25 and 26 are the
document
in question.
<P>

24	Pages 25 and 26 are xerox copies of documents produced by the Advance Bank
to the Court in answer to a subpoena; the affidavit
of Ms Gilbert shows this.
Their admissibility is in the same situation as the document which the Advance
Bank produced.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 51</a> in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p2.2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2.2</a> provides:
<P>

	<i>"The principles and rules of the Common Law that relate to the means of
proving the contents of a document are abolished."  </i>
<P>

<i>	</i>This abolishes the previous law relating to secondary evidence and
proof of copies to show the contents of documents.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p2.2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2.2</a> Documents,
including <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a>, puts a different scheme in its place.
<P>

25	The fact that a copy is tendered has no significance for admissibility, and
the admissibility of the documents is in the same
position as if the plaintiff
proceeded under the opening words of sub-section 48(1) - 
<P>

	<i>"A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question by
tendering the document in question..."</i>
<P>

26	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 51</a> does not abolish or in any way affect the need to prove that a
document tendered is the document which it purports to be, and subs
48(1) does
not authorise the adduction of evidence merely by tendering a document in the
absence of any evidence establishing what
the document is.  Sub-section 48(1)
is not an enactment to the effect that documents are to be received in evidence
on the basis
of what appears on their own face.  Sub-section 48(1) prescribes
the means of adducing evidence of the contents of documents, and
leaves
untouched the need to establish that a document is what it purports to be; it
does not mean that documents prove themselves,
as if judicial notice must be
taken of them.  
<P>

27	If sub-section 48(1) meant that all that had to be done to establish the
authenticity of a document was to tender it, it would
dispense with the need to
prove the authenticity of a document and put the Court entirely in the hands of
whatever a document which
a party chose to tender purported to be, subject to
whatever opportunity another party had of overcoming its apparent effect.  I
would regard an enactment to that effect as absurd, and I would look for other
constructions; however I do not think that sub-section
48(1) has that
effect.
<P>

28	So far as I am aware there is no judgment which has decided that under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> the authenticity of a document tendered in evidence may be
determined simply on the basis of the form and contents of the document
or on
that basis taken with information about the source from which it was produced
showing  that it was produced on subpoena and
by whom.  References in case law
to authentication of documents tendered are usually brief and incidental.
Texts dealing with the
legislation do not appear to have commented to the
effect that under the legislation documents establish their own authenticity.
See the comment on business records in <b>Cross on Evidence , </b>5th
Australian Ed. (J.D. Heydon QC) at paragraphs [5540 - 5550], which deals with
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 48</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 69</a>, among others and makes no comparison with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/s45b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 45b</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1929</a> (South Australia) with which that work deals at [35400].  I
have not noticed any such observation in Mr Odgers' "Uniform Evidence
Law" 3rd
Ed. 1998 either. 
<P>

29	The Law Reform Commission appears not to have regarded their drafts as
bringing about that result.  See LRC 26, Vol. 1, para.
31 particularly
paragraph 654; the comments in paragraph 654 appear to assume the continuing
need for proof of authenticity; see
text at Note 16 in the final sentence.  See
too Chapter 40 Judicial Notice paragraphs 985 and 986 dealing with
self-authentication.
 See too paragraphs 981.  See Chapter 24 authentication
and identification, paragraph 498.  See too paragraph 981.  See too paragraphs
707, 981, 982 and 983.  In LRC 26 Vol. 2 Para 282 again dealing with
authentication and identification the Law Reform Commission
referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/s45b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.45b</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1929</a> (SA) and commented:
<P>

	<i>"No authentication is required initially  -  it is enough that the document
be (1) apparently genuine."</i>
<P>

30	At page 551 Note 25 to paragraph 985 includes this sentence:
<P>

	<i>"Consideration was given to including a proposal that in Civil trials a
document tendered in evidence be assumed to be authentic in
the absence of
objection."</i>
<P>

This proposal was not adopted by the Law Reform Commission.  At Paragraph 992
there is a recommendation for legislation providing
to the effect that a
document 20 years old produced from proper custody is presumed to be authentic.
Other references at paras 707,
982, 983 and 986 may illustrate what was
proposed.
<P>

31	The Law Reform Commission's drafts were not in the same form as the
legislation as later enacted.  Chapter 31 of LRC 26  - Evidence
of Documents  -
was directed to proposals which were not enacted; the distinction between
primary and secondary evidence of the contents
of documents was to be preserved
in the proposals, but the Act takes a different course.  The need for
authentication of evidence
was seen as continuing  -  paragraph 659 shows this.

<P>

32	Commentary in LRC 38 does not appear to support the view that the Law Reform
Commission recommended dispensing with authentication
of documents, or doing so
prima facie, or adopting the principles of the South Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/s45b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 45b.</a>  The
draft explanatory memorandum dealing with Clause 125, at Appendix A, page 243,
does not suggest that Clause 125 (which corresponds
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> as enacted) made
any large change in the need for evidence authenticating a document.  It does
not seem possible that, after addressing
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/ea192980/s45b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.45b</a>, the Law Reform Commission could
have contemplated adoption of its principles without explicitly indicating that
it was recommending
this large change.  
<P>

33	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 152</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, which relates to documents more than
20 years old produced from proper custody, appears to deal with authentication.
Its presence
in the Act is inconsistent with there being a wider general
presumption of authenticity.  The reference in Subs 144(1)(b) to <i>"a document
the authority of which cannot reasonably be question" </i>is also inconsistent
with a wide general presumption of authenticity.
<P>

34	If the Court is to find a significant fact on which a large liability may
depend, there is a need for the Court to have some
measure of confidence in the
source of the Court's belief that the fact exists.  The Court acts almost
always on narrations which
must have a human origin; not usually on the Court's
own knowledge or on states of fact which are taken to be incontestable.  The
balance of probabilities is not a demanding standard, as the possibility that
the less probable state of fact may be the true one
is very obvious, and makes
civil justice very vulnerable to error.  For the Court to feel confident that
it should act on any narration
it is very important to have a human witness who
has pledged, by oath or affirmation, that the narration is true: someone who is
responsible for it.  Business records may be incomplete; they often are.  They
record what there is perceived to be a business need
to record, and that may be
a small part or an oblique aspect of the objective event.  
<P>

35	The factual context in which the plaintiff is in a position to tender pages
25 and 26 appears from the affidavit of Ms Gilbert
and from other documents in
Exhibit SEG-3.  On 25 March the plaintiff served a subpoena on Advance Bank
Australia Limited at its
office in George Street, Sydney and the schedule of
the subpoena called for a very long list of original documents or copies
including
statements of account No. 146459720 in the name of Peter Mato for the
period 1 August 1996 to date, and for a number of other records
and deposit
slips, but none specifically relating to the deposit of $2,850 on 18 June 1996
to that account.  In answer the Advance
Bank produced a copy of a bank cheque
dated 2 July 1996, pages 25 and 26, a record of transaction relating to deposit
of $2,850 on
18 June 1996 but not identifying the depositor and at pages 28 and
29 a personal account application of obscure date by Francis Mato
relating to
account No. 146459720.  (The second defendant's name is Peter Francis Mato).

<P>

36	In summary these documents show that when ordered by the Court's subpoena to
produce statement of account No. 146479720 in the
name of Peter Mato, Advance
Bank produced documents, including pages 25 and 26, relating to its customer
Francis Mato.  The statements
do not relate to the period called for; they
relate to the period from 31 January 1996 to 8 July 1996.
<P>

37	I am asked then to find on the basis of Advance Bank's behaviour in
responding to the subpoena that pages 25 and 26 meet the
three requirements of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 69</a> to which I earlier referred.  The evidence of Ms Gibson establishes that
Advance Bank responded in that way to the calls in the subpoena.
 In support of
the tender counsel referred me to other documents of which I have nothing
before me but their face value; they are
the subpoena, a copy of the affidavit
of service of subpoena and the other documents which the bank produced.  All of
them are subject
to at least the same difficulties for their admissibility,
even for the purpose of testing the admissibility of a documents tendered;
and
possibly greater difficulties as some of them are less apparently business
records even in purport.  
<P>

38	The plaintiff needs to obtain a finding for the purposes of the admission of
the evidence tendered to the effect that pages 25
and 26 meet the three
requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a>, and to obtain that finding must rely on evidence relevant
to the conditions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> according to the prescription of sub-section 55(1).
That test is:  
<P>

	<i>The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were
accepted, could rationally effect (directly or indirectly)
the assessment of
the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings."</i>
<P>

The standard of proof for a fact on which the admissibility of evidence depends
is the balance of probability; sub-section 142 (1).
<P>

39	The line of reasoning that I am asked to follow is the effect that the fact
that Advance Bank produced pages 25 and 26 in answer
to the call in the
subpoena for bank statements could rationally affect the assessment of the
probability that the bank statement
of which pages 25 and 26 are copies forms
part of the records belonging to Advance Bank, that it contains information
recorded in
the course of Advance Bank's business, and that that information
was made in one of the ways referred to in subs. 69(2).  In this
line of
reasoning, as Advance Bank sent these documents to the Court and had a duty to
do so, everything that the documents apparently
record is probably in order as
a business record.
<P>

40	I think it is obvious that reasoning in this way could easily and often
produce seriously erroneous findings; it surrenders all
the vigilance which
experience of life and the law suggests to me is required in serious affairs.
However, the test of relevance
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 55(1)</a> is a test stated with
studied breadth, and it appears to me as a matter of fact that Advance Bank's
behaviour in producing a document
in response to the subpoena could rationally
affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts which
make the
document a business record within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 69.</a>  The unsatisfactory nature of
the process of reasoning is somewhat masked by the circumstance that the
recipient of the subpoena
was a bank; there would be many recipients of
subpoenas whose response might receive an initially less generous
interpretation than
an institution in the conduct of which the community
usually replaces confidence, while the superficiality of that interpretation
of
the conduct of a bank is clear enough.
<P>

41	As means of proof of the records of the Advance Bank, the circumstances
relating to Advance  Bank's response to the subpoena
appear to me to be
vehemently unsatisfactory; the peril that a finding of fact would be erroneous
if it is based on such material
appears to me to be great.  In saying this I
bring to bear on my appraisal of the facts my experience of the conduct of
legal business
and the responses of parties to subpoenas; that is not a branch
of human behaviour in which I regard people as highly reliable. 
Far better
means of proving the authenticity of bank statements are obvious and ready to
hand, and I have to consider how readily
they could have been used in a serious
endeavour to prove important facts.  
<P>

42	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that pages 25 and 26 are
what they are alleged to be; that is I am not satisfied
and do not find for the
purpose of their admissibility that they are business records being bank
statements of the account conducted
by the second defendant with the Advance
Bank. 
<P>

43	The machinery in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s166.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 166</a> to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s169.html" class="autolink_findacts">169</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> is not applicable as
the plaintiff did not give notice of its intention to tender these documents in
time to allow a request under
subs 167(1) to be made within 21 days (subs.
168(1)).  One outcome of the machinery is that the Court may make orders in
subs 169(1)
including an order that the evidence is not to be admitted in
evidence (para (c)):  this group of sections and the machinery for
which it
provides do not enable any document or other evidence to be admitted in
evidence, and the legal basis for its admission
must be found elsewhere.  If
authenticity must be proved, these sections do not provide means of proof of
authenticity.  
<P>

44	The tender is rejected.
