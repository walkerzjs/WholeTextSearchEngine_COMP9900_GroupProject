<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> This litigation arises out of a Fee Agreement between
the plaintiff and the first defendant of 22 October 1997 which is contained
in
Ex A.  
<P>

2		The context is that the plaintiff and the first defendant were in
negotiations and had agreed for the plaintiff to purchase land
owned by the
first defendant; a lessee referred to as Tasman was in occupation and
negotiations were in train for the first defendant
to lease a small part of the
land to Optus Communications Limited (or it may be a subsidiary of Optus
Communications Limited), and
in association with that to obtain a partial
surrender of the Tasman lease.
<P>

3	There already were some arrangements, not dealt with in detail in the
evidence, for Telstra to maintain equipment on the land.
 The land to be leased
to Optus is said to contain twenty square metres and to adjoin the land leased
to Telstra.  As well as the
lease of twenty square metres, there was need to
make access arrangements.  
<P>

4	The plaintiff, as purchaser, was to take over the negotiations set in train
between the first defendant and Optus, and was to
seek to obtain the benefit of
negotiations which were then in progress and of the contemplated lease to
Optus.  
<P>

5	The Fee Agreement established the terms on which the first defendant would
support the continuing negotiations between the plaintiff
and Optus and the
plaintiff would pay a fee to the first defendant on success.  The fee was to be
$35,000 and by clause 5.3 of the
Fee Agreement, Messrs Blake Dawson Waldron
would hold that amount from completion of the purchase as stakeholder and as
security
for the payment of the fee.
<P>

6	The second defendant, Mr Kaplan, is a solicitor who was joined as a party to
represent Messrs Blake Dawson Waldron in their capacity
as stakeholders.  He
has left the litigation because under orders made on 4 March 1999 the plaintiff
had leave to discontinue against
him and Messrs Blake Dawson Waldron paid
$35,000 into Court.  Mr Kaplan has taken no further part in the litigation
since the payment
in.
<P>

7	The Fee Agreement of 22 October 1997  includes these provisions.  In clause 1
"Definitions and Interpretation," Clause 1.1 contains
the following
definitions:
<P>

	<i>	"Optus" means Optus Communications Limited;</i>
<P>

<i>		"Proposed Lease" means a proposed lease with Optus of the premises on
substantially the same terms as the terms set out in the Schedule."</i>
<P>

8	The Schedule contains particulars of the rent, rent increases, lease period
and other terms and conditions.  It is not contended
that the arrangements made
by the plaintiff with Optus, so far as they have gone, have involved any
material change in provisions
relating to rent, rent increases and lease
period.  The Schedule concludes by stating:
<P>

	<i>"Other terms and conditions as set out in draft lease for collocating
Telstra Corporation Tower, a copy of which is annexed"</i>
<P>

9	The annexure is a draft lease which bears the date 5 September 1997.  In
fact, the draft does not mention Optus Communications
Limited;  the lessee
referred to in the draft was Optus Mobile Pty Limited.
<P>

10	In the substantial provisions of the lease the first defendant agreed to
continue his negotiations pending completion (clause
2) and the plaintiff
agreed to take over the negotiations with Optus after completion; the first
defendant agreed to provide the
plaintiff with assistance in the
negotiations.
<P>

11	Clause 3.2 stated:
<P>

	<i>"Votraint shall continue such negotiations with Optus in good faith with a
view to entering into the proposed lease."</i>
<P>

12	Clause 3.2 is an important provision because, in a way, it interacts with
provisions relating to entitlement to a fee.  
<P>

13	Clause 4 dealt with the need for the plaintiff to deal with Tasman with a
view to obtaining its agreement to surrender a part
of its lease, and the
plaintiff agreed to use all reasonable endeavours in that regard.  
<P>

14	By Clause 4.2, the first defendant acknowledged the significance of
obtaining Tasman's agreement.
<P>

15	Clause 5 "Payment of Fee" is as follows:
<P>

	<i>"5.1	Upon Votraint accepting a lease executed by Optus in the form of the
Proposed Lease and a surrender of lease executed by Tasman
for the partial
surrender of its lease as referred to in clause 4, Votraint will pay to Uren
the Fee PROVIDED THAT if the rent, the
rent increases or the term of the
executed lease differ from the details in the Schedule then the Fee shall be an
amount equal to
31.7 per cent of the total rental payable during the term of
the lease executed by Optus.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.2	If the events referred to in clause in 5.1 do not occur by 31 August
1998, this Agreement shall terminate and Votraint shall
be under no obligation
to pay to Uren the Fee notwithstanding that it may enter into the Proposed
Lease after that date.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.3	As security for the payment of the Fee, Votraint agrees on completion
of the purchase of the Land to pay to its solicitors, Blake
Dawson Waldron, as
stakeholder, a sum equal to the Fee to be paid as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>		(a)	to Uren under clause 5.1; or</i>
<P>

<i>		(b)	to Votraint after 31 May 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>		PROVIDED THAT if prior to that date, Votraint provides to Uren evidence
that Tasman will not agree to a partial surrender of its
lease on terms set out
in clause 4.1 the stakeholder may refund the monies to Votraint after giving to
Uren or its solicitors notice
of its intention to do the same".</i>
<P>

16	Clause 5.3 explains the earlier presence of Mr Kaplan and his firm as
stakeholder.  As appears from Clause 5.3, the security
was to exist only until
31 May 1998, whereas the events which might bring about payability of the fee
were to occur by 31 August
1998.  The effect is that the security was to exist
only for part of the time during which the contingencies might have been
fulfilled;
 after 31 May 1998, the first defendant had no entitlement to
security but he still might come to be entitled to payment of the fee.
<P>

17	An obvious circumstance attending Clauses 5.1 and 5.2 was the degree of
control that the plaintiff had over the fulfilment of
the contingencies upon
which the fee was payable and the susceptibility of the first defendant's
prospective entitlement to inaction
or deliberately subversive behaviour by the
plaintiff.  This contingency was dealt with by clause 3.2, the good faith
obligation.
<P>

18	The issues raised by the amended summons and the cross- claim do not extend
to any claim for breach of the good faith obligation
which, I would think, if
broken, would give rise to an entitlement to damages, at the highest.  On my
understanding of the expressions
in the agreement, breach of the good faith
obligation would not interact directly with the contingencies in Clause 5 on
which the
fee is payable;  it is not a condition of the defeasance of
payability in Clause 5.2 or of any other defeasance that the good faith
obligation should have been kept, and this points towards the view that the
available remedy for breach of the good faith obligation
would be a damages
claim.
<P>

19	Counsel showed me an agreement between the parties which narrowed the issues
so as to leave any claims relating to the good faith
obligation, clause 3.2,
out of consideration in the present proceedings.  That agreement may have some
implications for the further
conduct of the parties but I must leave that to
them.
<P>

20	The plaintiff claims a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to a fee
of $35,000.  This is a rather distorted expression,
the point of what is
claimed, as the assertion that the defendant is not entitled to the fee.  The
plaintiff also claims an order
that the sum of $35,000 now in Court be paid to
it.  The cross-claim, which I gave the first defendant leave to file (although
it
has not yet been filed) will claim a declaration that the plaintiff is
obliged to pay the first defendant the fee and also an order
for the payment of
the money in Court to the first defendant which would achieve satisfaction of
the alleged obligation.
<P>

21	Negotiations relating to a grant by the plaintiff of a lease to Optus
proceeded with painful slowness and a series of complications,
contributed to
very significantly by the three-cornered nature of the negotiations and the
need to involve Tasman.
<P>

22	It seems that from the beginning the documents under consideration showed
the proposed lessee as Optus Mobile Pty Limited.  Solicitors
undertaking the
plaintiff's conveyancing business called on 24 November 1997 (see page A20) or
perhaps on 25 November 1997 (see page
A21) for a guarantee and required that
the obligations of the lessee should be guaranteed by the parent company of
Optus Mobile Pty
Limited.  This was refused on 26 November 1997 (see page A23),
in lofty terms, and negotiations continued on the basis that the lessee
was to
be Optus Mobile Pty Limited.
<P>

23	After much correspondence and vicissitudes the form of the documents came to
be agreed and on 27 January 1999 the solicitors
representing Optus forwarded a
stamped and executed lease (and the arrangements had been changed so as to
provide for two leases
for successive periods) and also fees for the of
mortgagee's consent.  The arrangements attending the lease were not then
completed
but they have proceeded.  It is not clear to me that they are yet
entirely complete, but it can be confidently expected that they
will be
completed.
<P>

24	It was contended by counsel for the plaintiff that one of the contingencies
on which payability of the fee depends which has
not occurred is that the
lessee is or is to be Optus Mobile Pty Limited.  On the literal terms and plain
expression of the principal
clause in the Fee Agreement the contingency in
Clause 5.1 relates to execution of a lease by Optus which is defined as Optus
Communications
Limited, and of course that has not happened.  However, it is
necessary to look at the whole of the Fee Agreement to understand what
it
means, including which company was referred to as Optus, and the Fee Agreement
includes the annexure, the draft lease which plainly
nominated Optus Mobile Pty
Limited as the lessee.
<P>

25	Clause 5.1, the clause referring to Optus, refers to the form of the
proposed lease, and by addressing the definition of "Proposed
Lease," the
Schedule and the annexed copy of a draft lease, that can be seen to be a
proposed lease to Optus Mobile Pty Limited.
 There is an internal inconsistency
in the express provisions of the Fee Agreement in this respect.  The parties
were plainly not
using language identifying Optus with a high degree of
precision.  If precision had been thought of as important and it had been
thought of as significant for the parties' obligations that the parent should
be the lessee and that  a subsidiary should not be
the lessee, there is a high
probability that the terms of the agreement would have reflected this.  That
the parties spoke in terms
in which one Optus company was to be the lessee at
one place and another Optus company was to be the lessee at another place shows
that the exact identity of the lessee was not of prominent importance.
<P>

26	In my view, I should attribute greater weight to references identifying the
lessee in the draft lease than to the references
identifying the lessee in
clause 5.1 and the interpretation section.  The draft lease is, in my view,
much likelier to represent
what the parties really had in contemplation for the
identity of the lessee.  
<P>

27	The defendant's counsel contended that the later course of dealings, in
which solicitors' correspondence setting out the parties'
positions and
contentions did not include this point and that the point had no reflection
during the long period of negotiations,
supported his reading.  I do not think
that it does. On the terms of the Fee Agreement itself it should be understood
that acceptance
of a lease by Optus Mobile Pty Limited fulfils the
contingencies. 
<P>

28	The defendant's counsel's contentions with respect to fulfilment of the
contingencies on which the fee is payable were to the
effect that clauses 5.1
and 5.2 are concerned with what was to happen in substance, and that there had
to be a lease arrangement
in place for the occupation of the property.  He
contended that the date of occupation by the proposed lessee was the critical
date
and said that the contingency was fulfilled when under an arrangement in
correspondence Optus actually went into occupation and its
operations on site
began about February 1998.  The defendant's counsel contended that occupation
and not signing a document is the
critical event.  By 31 August 1998 there had
actually been a proposed lessee in occupation and paying rent for almost six
months,
and counsel contended that this fulfilled what had been contemplated
and that the plaintiff had got what was expected, that is, the
benefit of the
negotiations that the first defendant had in train at the time of the sale.
<P>

29	In my opinion, the events to which counsel referred do not constitute events
fulfilling the contingencies in Clause 5.1.  The
terms of clause 5.1 do not
contemplate an informal arrangement such as was made in correspondence for
Optus to go into possession
pending completion of a lease.  It is not at all
clear what tenant right Optus had by August 1998.  It appears to have been no
more
than a tenancy at will, as I cannot see in the correspondence that any
material and binding agreement to grant a lease then existed.
 Even if it had
existed, the terms of clause 5.1 do not refer to an agreement for lease but to
formalities; they refer to accepting
a lease and to the lease being one then
executed by Optus.  There was also to be a surrender executed by Tasman and
that had not
happened at any time in 1998.  
<P>

30	In my view the payability of the fee depends on the exact fulfilment of the
conditions stated.  This is not a matter where it
can be said that it is enough
to fulfil the substance of the obligation.  In any event the substance of the
obligation could not
be said to have been fulfilled by 31 August 1998.  The
cut-off point when the opportunity to achieve entitlement to the fee came
to an
end is drawn sharp and clear by the terms of clause 5.2;  if the events to
which it referred did not occur by the stated date
the Fee Agreement then
terminated, and the consequences laboriously spelled out by clause 5.2 came
about, that is, the plaintiff
was under no obligation to pay the fee and was
under no obligation notwithstanding that it later entered into the proposed
lease.
<P>

31	The orders are:
<P>

	1.	I declare that the first defendant is not entitled and cannot now become
entitled to payment of the fee of $35,000 referred
to in clause 5 of the Fee
Agreement between the plaintiff and the first defendant dated 22 October
1997.
<P>

	2.	I order that the moneys paid into Court in pursuance of the order of 4
March 1999 by Messrs Blake Dawson Waldron, solicitors,
together with any
interest since payment in be paid out of Court to the plaintiff.
<P>

	3.	I order that the first defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the
plaintiff's claim. 
<P>

	4.	The cross-claim is dismissed with costs.
