SUPREME COURT OF
<P>

NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Tuesday, 13 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3231 of 1987	QUEENSBORO PTY LIMITED   -v-   BUTLER POLLNOW PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>    At the commencement of the hearing of
this matter I stated, and had it recorded, that I was acquainted with Alexander
Barclay
Shand, the eighth cross-defendant. That fact caused no problem to any
of the parties thereto to my hearing the present application.
I was also
informed that a member of one of the partnerships in respect of which the
substantive proceedings are brought by the plaintiff
is the Honourable John
Edward Horace Brownie, formerly a Judge and currently an Acting Judge of the
Supreme Court, with whom I am
also acquainted. Again, that fact caused no
problem to any of the parties thereto to my hearing the present application.
<P>

2   	By notice of motion filed on 25 November 1998 Butler
Pollnow Pty Limited and Errol Hugh Pollnow, the first and third defendants
respectively, seek, substantively, the following order:
<P>

Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> rule 26 and/or the inherent jurisdiction of
the Court that:
<P>

(a)	the statement of claim filed in these proceedings on 7 July 1987 ("SOC") be
dismissed generally as against the first and third
defendants; or
<P>

(b)	striking out the said SOC as against the first and third defendants.
<P>

3   	By that statement of claim, Queensboro Pty Limited (to
which I shall refer as "Queensboro"), the plaintiff alleges that payments
in
the sums of $598,967.24, $70,000 and $209,141.99 have been made to the first
and second defendants, those payments having been
procured by the third and
fourth defendants. Each of the payments is alleged to have been made in breach
of contract and in breach
of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff purports to sue both
on its own behalf and also in a representative capacity on behalf of six
specified
partnerships and the members of those partnerships.
<P>

4   	Notwithstanding that it was seeking recovery of those sums
in the present proceedings, the plaintiff whilst the present proceedings
were
on foot also sought to recover the same amounts against the third defendant in
the Local Court of New South Wales. It did so
in proceedings 618 of 1993 in the
Local Court of New South Wales at the Downing Centre. In those proceedings
Errol Hugh Pollnow was
the plaintiff and Queensboro Pty Limited was the
defendant. That plaintiff sued that defendant for money payable by the
defendant
to the plaintiff for money had and received by the defendant for the
use of the plaintiff, and claimed the sum of $5,569.76 together
with interest
thereon in an amount of $1,371.12. By notice of cross-claim filed on 24 March
1993 in those proceedings in the Local
Court the present plaintiff, Queensboro,

<P>

(a)	alleged that the sums of $598,967.24, $70,000 and $209,141.99 were owing to
it by the present third defendant, Errol Hugh Pollnow;
<P>

(b)	abandoned, pursuant to section 15(4) of the <i>Local Court (Civil Claims)
Act </i>1970, those sums in excess of the jurisdictional limit of $40,000;
<P>

(c)	claimed, after abandonment, the sum of $40,000.
<P>

5   	Subsequently a document headed "Terms of Settlement" and
further headed "Consent Orders    Terms of Settlement" was filed in
the Local
Court in those proceedings. Paragraph 2 of that document is in the following
terms,
<P>

Verdict for the Cross-defendant on the Cross-claim.
<P>

6   	That document also contains the following,
<P>

AND THE COURT NOTES:
<P>

A.	The terms and provisions expressed and the consideration given by the
Parties to the Deed in the Deed of Settlement and Release
dated 3rd December
1993 and annexed hereto
<P>

7   	That document is signed by the solicitor for Errol Hugh
Pollnow and executed under seal by Queensboro Pty Limited. It bears
the
following endorsement by the Registrar of the Local Court, dated 22 December
1993, "I note terms 1 to 5 and notations".
<P>

8   	The deed of settlement and release is annexed to the Terms
of Settlement. It is dated 3 December 1993. The parties thereto
are Errol Hugh
Pollnow and Butler Pollnow Pty Limited (collectively referred to as "Pollnow"),
Garden Mews St Leonards Pty Limited
("Garden Mews"), and Queensboro Pty Limited
("Queensboro").
<P>

9   	That deed contains the following operative clauses,
<P>

4.	All the Parties hereto agree that this is a full and final settlement
between them of the issues and matters as pleaded by them
in the Queensboro and
the Garden Mews proceedings.
<P>

5.	The Parties agree that this is a full and complete release which may be
pleaded by any party hereto in bar to action, suit or
proceedings where the
proceedings so brought or pleaded raises the same or similar issues or claims
as the pleadings in the Garden
Mews proceedings and/or the Queensboro
proceedings.
<P>

10   	The Queensboro proceedings and the Garden Mews
proceedings, which are referred to in the foregoing clauses, are identified
in
recitals B and C respectively to the deed, as follows,
<P>

B	Errol Hugh Pollnow has commenced proceedings against Garden Mews for the over
payment of an amount as claimed in Local Court proceedings
No. 617 of 1993,
"the Garden Mews proceedings".
<P>

C	Errol Hugh Pollnow has commenced proceedings against Queensboro for the over
payment of an amount as claimed in Local Court proceedings
No. 618 of 1993,
"the Queensboro proceedings".
<P>

11   	In proceedings commenced in the Commercial List of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1986 ("the Auditors proceedings"),
Queensboro sued it auditors, England Roberts and Company, for negligence and
breach of contract. The defendants to the present proceedings
(Butler Pollnow
Pty Limited, Butler Financial Services Pty Limited and Errol Hugh Pollnow) were
not joined as parties in those proceedings.
By its statement of claim in those
proceedings, filed on 6 March 1986, Queensboro sought damages in the sum of
$598,967.24, arising
from alleged overpayment. By its amended statement of
claim, Queensboro purported to sue on its own behalf and on behalf of the same
six partnerships and the same members of those partnerships as it alleges that
it is suing in the present proceedings. 
<P>

12   	Subsequently judgment in the auditor's proceedings was
entered in favour of Queensboro in 1989.
<P>

13   	I have already recorded that the notice of motion stated
that the relief sought therein is claimed pursuant to Part 13 rule
5, Part 15
rule 26 and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.
<P>

14   	However, the applicants did not, in fact, ground their
application on Part 15 rule 26 (which relates to the form of a pleading),
but
essentially relied upon the power of the Court to order summary dismissal (Part
13 rule 5) and the inherent jurisdiction of the
Court to prevent abuse of its
process. 
<P>

15   	Essentially, it was the submission of the applicants that,
whatever might have been the status of the proceedings at their
inception, the
consequence of the proceedings in the Local Court and the manner of the
compromise of those proceedings had the consequence
that, thereupon, either any
cause of action which might to that point have existed had ceased to exist or
that the continuation of
the proceedings constituted an abuse of the process of
the Court, with the effect that the applicants thereupon became entitled to
invoke the jurisdiction of the Court for the summary dismissal of the
proceedings. 
<P>

16   	Part 13 rule 5 provides, in subrule (1) thereof,
<P>

Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief
in the proceedings
---
<P>

(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;
<P>

(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or
<P>

(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court,
<P>

The Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or in
relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.

<P>

17   	(I would here observe that the inherent jurisdiction of
the Court to prevent abuse of its process is, to the extent that is
here
relevant, replicated in paragraph (c) of Rule 5 (1). Thus, no question can
arise as to the power of a Master to grant relief
of the nature sought upon the
ground of abuse of the process of the Court.)
<P>

18   	The principles relating to the exercise of the power of
summary dismissal are well recognised: see, for example, <i>General Steel
Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> at 128 - 130
per Barwick CJ.
<P>

19   	It was submitted on behalf of the present applicants that
there are three reasons --- each of which is conclusive --- why
the present
claim of Queensboro cannot succeed, and thus ought not be permitted to proceed.
Those reasons are:
<P>

(a)	The deed of settlement and release, which compromised the Local Court
proceedings;
<P>

(b)	The Local Court judgment, which gives rise to a <i>res judicata</i>;
<P>

(c)	Abandonment by Queensboro, under section 15(4) of the <i>Local Court (Civil
Claims) Act</i>, which resulted in the judgment against Queensboro on its
cross-claim being a full discharge of all demands in respect of the causes
of
action asserted by Queensboro.
<P>

20   	I shall proceed to a consideration of each of those reason
asserted by the applicants.
<P>

<b>(a)	<i>Deed of Settlement and Release</i></b>
<P>

21   	I have already observed that the parties to the deed of
settlement and release included the present applicants, Butler Pollnow
Pty
Limited and Errol Hugh Pollnow (who are collectively referred to therein as
"Pollnow") and the present plaintiff, Queensboro
Pty Limited (referred to
therein as "Queensboro"), and that the recitals to that deed include recital C
(which I have already set
forth).
<P>

22   	Clause 2 of the deed provides,
<P>

Queensboro agrees to pay Pollnow and Pollnow agrees to accept the sum of
$7,723.16 in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims
and issues pleaded,
raised, and/or referred to in the Queensboro proceedings.
<P>

23   	It was submitted on behalf of the present applicants that
the present proceedings raise the same issues or claims as were
contained in
the cross-claim in the Local Court proceedings. Precisely the same monetary
amounts in dollars and cents are claimed
in the present proceedings as were
claimed in the Local Court proceedings. The present proceedings contain three
claims for liquidated
damages (or equitable compensation), being for:
<P>

(a)	$598,967.24, representing alleged overpayments of management fees by
Queensboro to the first defendant (paragraphs 11 - 15);
<P>

(b)	$70,000, representing payment of a financial procurement fee to which the
second defendant was allegedly not entitled (paragraphs
16 - 19);
<P>

(c)	$209,141.99, alleged to be unauthorised and outstanding loans made by
Queensboro to the first defendant (paragraphs 23 - 28).
<P>

24   	The defendant to the Local Court proceedings, Queensboro,
on 24 March 1993 filed a notice of cross-claim (dated 23 March 1993).
I have
already recorded that by that document the defendant claimed the sum of
$878,109.23, that the defendant abandoned, under section
14 of the <i>Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Act,</i> the sum of $838,109.23; and that the defendant
claimed, after abandonment, the sum of $40,000.
<P>

25   	The particulars of cross-claim annexed to that document
identify the total amount of $878,109.23, that amount comprising claims
for
liquidated damages as follows,
<P>

(a)	$598,967.24, representing alleged overpayments of management fees by
Queensboro to the first defendant, Errol Hugh Pollnow (paragraphs
3 - 5, 6(b),
7, 8);
<P>

(b)	$70,000, representing payment of a financial procurement fee to which the
second defendant was allegedly not entitled (paragraphs
3 - 5, 6(a), 7, 8);
<P>

(c)	$209,141.99, representing unauthorised and outstanding loans allegedly made
by Queensboro to the first defendant (paragraphs
9 - 11).
<P>

26   	Each of the material allegations in the cross-claim filed
in the Local Court has a counterpart in the statement of claim in
the present
proceedings.
<P>

27   	It was submitted on behalf of the present applicants that
the Supreme Court proceedings clearly raise the "same or similar
issues or
claims" as were the subject of the Local Court proceedings 618 of 1993
(referred to in the deed as "the Queensboro proceedings"),
and that the
underlying substratum of fact is identical. It was submitted that the causes of
action pleaded in the statement of claim
in the Supreme Court proceedings fall
squarely within the ambit of clause 5 of the deed. 
<P>

28   	It is appropriate here to record that at the hearing of
the present application Mr Martin Einfeld of Queen's Counsel, for
the
plaintiff, stated that he did not submit that the subject matters of the two
proceedings were not substantially similar. 
<P>

29   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, as a
matter of construction, the deed does not have the effect for which
the
applicants contend.
<P>

30   	In support of that primary submission the plaintiff
submitted that the deed did not contemplate a release from, or a discharge
of,
the claims raised in the present proceedings, for the following reasons:
<P>

(i)	As at the date of the deed, 3 December 1993, the present proceedings had
been on foot for some years. The proceedings had been
instituted by statement
of claim filed on 7 July 1987.
<P>

(ii)	The existence of the Supreme Court proceedings must have been present to
the minds of the parties and their representatives.
For example, in June 1993
(only six months earlier) the first and third defendants filed an amended
defence and cross-claim. In July
of that year the plaintiff sought particulars
of those pleadings. Also in July 1993 the plaintiff (by summons 12935 of 1993)
sought
to remove into the Supreme Court the proceedings in the Local Court.
<P>

(iii)	It is inconceivable, so it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff,
that, if the operative provisions of the deed (especially
clauses 4 and 5) had
been intended to effect a release in respect of the present Supreme Court
proceedings, the Supreme Court proceedings
would not have been described in the
recitals and would not have been referred to in terms in the operative
provisions. 
<P>

(iv)	The deed, so it was submitted, plainly addresses future proceedings. It
was submitted that the language of the deed is entirely
inappropriate to catch
the then current Supreme Court proceedings. That such was the case is manifest
from the fact that, following
execution of the deed, neither of the applicant
defendants sought to plead its terms in bar to the claim of Queensboro in the
present
proceedings. No steps were taken by them to seek dismissal of the
Supreme Court proceedings, and no such steps are contemplated by
the terms of
the deed. 
<P>

31   	A deed is the most solemn and binding manner known to the
law by which one party obliges itself contractually to another party.
A deed
does not merely evidence an agreement. It creates contractual rights between
the parties thereto. 
<P>

32   	In the instant case the provisions of the deed are clear
and unambiguous. There is nothing in clause 5 of the deed which has
the effect
of limiting its operation to future action, suit or proceedings. Indeed, by the
very terms of clause 4, the deed effects
a resolution of proceedings then
currently on foot in the Local Court. 
<P>

33   	Further, it must be clearly recognised that the Local
Court proceedings, the resolution whereof was effected by clause 4 of
the deed
included the cross-claim of the present plaintiff for precisely the same causes
of action and precisely the same amounts
as are the subject of the present
proceedings. It is difficult to envisage any reason why the plaintiff would in
the Local Court
proceedings have brought such a cross-claim, recognising
expressly that in doing so the maximum verdict which could be awarded to
it on
the cross-claim would be $40,000, unless it were prepared to abandon whatever
rights it might have had to receive a higher
verdict in the then current
proceedings in the Supreme Court. 
<P>

34   	I am satisfied that the effect of clause 5 of the deed is
to constitute a full and complete release in respect of the cause
of action
which the plaintiff had against the third defendant for the amounts claimed in
the Local Court, which amounts are the identical
amounts claimed against the
first and third defendants in the present proceedings. 
<P>

35   	Clause 5 creates a right in the third defendant to plead
in bar the release created by that clause. That is a right which
I am satisfied
can be exercised by the third defendant in the present proceedings. The fact
that the third defendant has not sought
to do so does not in my conclusion in
any way derogate from the full and complete release of the claim by the
plaintiff against him
which is created by clause 5 of the deed. 
<P>

36   	It would seem to me to be an unnecessary and time
consuming exercise were the third defendant to be required to seek the leave
of
the Court to amend his defence in the present proceedings merely to insert a
plea in bar grounded upon the release contained in
clause 5 of the deed. Such
an amendment would then, almost certainly, give rise to an application by the
applicants of the nature
of that presently before the Court, or a similar
application concerning the effect of such a plea in bar. (It will be
appreciated
that a plea in bar, if established, has the effect of barring the
claim made against the defendant who, in answer thereto, has filed
the plea in
bar.)
<P>

37   	I can see no legitimate complaint which can be levelled
against the applicants (in particular, against the third defendant),
on account
of the present application having been brought without the (in my view,
unnecessary) intervening step of the third defendant
seeking to amend his
defence by pleading in bar the release effected by clause 5 of the deed.
<P>

38   	I am satisfied that the terms of the deed between the
parties, and, in particular, clause 5 of the deed, have the effect that
the
present claim of the plaintiff is terminated and defeated by the deed. 
<P>

<b> (b)	<i>Res Judicata from judgment in the Local Court</i></b>
<P>

39   	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant defendants
that, as in the case of a judgment consequent upon a contested hearing,
a
judgment entered by consent may give rise to a <i>res judicata</i>. In this
regard the defendants relied upon the following passages from Spencer Bower,
Turner and Handley, <i>The Doctrine of Res Judicata</i> (3 ed, Butterworths,
London, 1996), paragraphs 38 - 39,
<P>

Judgments, orders and awards by consent are as efficacious as those pronounced
after a contest...
<P>

Any issue which the parties recognised was the subject of the litigation and
was fundamental to the judgment or order will be conclusively
determined. 
<P>

40   	The foregoing passages (which appeared also in the second
edition, <i>sub. nom. </i>Spencer Bower &amp; Turner,<i> The Doctrine of Res
Judicata</i>) were applied by Dunford J in <i>Gray v Furber</i> (23 May 1995,
unreported), where His Honour struck out subsequent proceedings instituted in
the Supreme Court after orders had been
made by consent in the Local Court
dismissing proceedings brought on the same cause of action. His Honour held
that, final orders
having been made, the matter was <i>res judicata</i> and the
parties were estopped from averring or claiming to the contrary, such
consequence arising notwithstanding that the orders
had been made by consent,
and that a second action could not be brought which was founded on the same
cause of action.
<P>

41   	In <i>Chamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 502</a> the High Court of Australia (Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ)

Mason and Aickin JJ in <i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Limited</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589</a> at 597, which included the following statement,
<P>

The rule as to <i>res judicata </i>comes into operation whenever a party
attempts in a second proceeding to litigate a cause of action which has merged
into judgment
in a prior proceeding.
<P>

42   	Their Honours, at 508, said that the principle of <i>res
judicata</i> holds good in the case of a judgment entered by consent. 
<P>

43   	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant defendants
that the specific payments alleged in the cross-claim to have been
made in
breach of contract, breach of duty of care and breach of fiduciary duty were
clearly fundamental to the cross-claim. In consequence,
so it was submitted,
judgment having been given against Queensboro as cross-claimant, those claims
cannot be re-agitated in the Supreme
Court. The applicants relied expressly
upon the document headed Consent Order Terms of Settlement and the notation
thereon by the
Registrar of the Local Court, which document has been filed in
the Local Court on 22 December 1993. 
<P>

44   	It was submitted, however, on behalf of the plaintiff
that, in fact, there had not been a judgment of the Local Court on the
cross-claim. Evidence was given of an attempt made during the course of the
hearing before me on 3 May 1999 by the solicitor for
the defendants to obtain
in documentary form the judgment of the Local Court on the cross-claim. The
existence of such a document
(equivalent to a certified or office copy of the
minute of a judgment entered in the Supreme Court --- see, in this regard Part
41
of the Supreme Court Rules, and, in particular, Divisions 4 and 5 thereof)
would have placed beyond doubt the question of whether
or not there had been a
judgment for the defendants upon the cross-claim of a nature which would give
rise to the existence of <i>res judicata</i>. 
<P>

45   	In consequence of the failure on Monday, 3 May 1999 of the
solicitor for the defendants to obtain such a certified or office
copy of the
minute of the judgment on the cross-claim, at the conclusion of the hearing
that day, upon the application of the applicant
defendants (which was opposed
by the plaintiff), I adjourned the further hearing of the matter to the
following Friday, 7 May 1999.
The reason for that adjournment was to enable the
defendants to make further efforts to obtain such a document from the Registry
of the Local Court. At the time of the granting of that adjournment I noted
that I was of the opinion that the hearing, had it not
been so adjourned at
3:07pm on 3 May 1999, would have concluded that afternoon.
<P>

46   	When the hearing resumed on Friday, 7 May 1999 the
defendants offered no further evidence. However, I heard further submissions
from Senior Counsel for the respective parties. 
<P>

47   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
absence of any such certified copy or office copy of the minute of the
judgment
in the Local Court had the consequence that the applicant defendants were
precluded from establishing the existence of <i>res judicata</i>. In that
regard, however, a careful reading of section 15 of the <i>Local Courts (Civil
Claims) Act</i> reveals that the judgment which is referred to in subsection
(7) of that section is a judgment in favour of a cross-claimant. 
<P>

48   	The word judgment is often used somewhat loosely when a
claim (be it in proceedings as originally constituted, or be it in
a
cross-claim subsequently brought by one of the parties) is unsuccessful and an
order is made dismissing that claim. In those circumstances,
there is no
judgment as such, since an essential element of the concept of a judgment is an
entitlement to the enforcement or execution
by a party of a decision of the
court in favour of that party. Where the party on the receiving end of court
process is successful
in having that process against it dismissed, then there
can be no judgment which that successful party can enforce. 
<P>

49   	Strictly speaking, therefore, the disposal of the
cross-claim in favour of the cross-defendants in accordance with the Consent
Orders Terms of Settlement was not a judgment of the Local Court of the nature
contemplated by section 15(7) of the <i>Local Court (Civil Claims) Act</i>. 
<P>

50   	Consistently with such a conclusion, the provisions of
section 31 of that Act (concerning the entry of judgment in the records
of a
Local Court and the certification of that entry or a copy thereof by the
Registrar being received as evidence of that judgment)
do not apply when
proceedings against a party are dismissed. Also consistently therewith, section
70 deems an order for the payment
of an amount of money by one person to
another to be a judgment, for the purposes of Division 6 of Part 4 (relating to
interest)
and of Part 5 (enforcement of judgment). 
<P>

51   	In the procedure of the Local Court as provided by the
foregoing statute and by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Rules </i>1988</a>
there appears to be no procedure equivalent to that in the Supreme Court
(provided by Divisions 4 and 5 of Part 41 of the Supreme
Court Rules) for the
entry of an order. Neither section 4(3) of the <i>Local Courts (Civil Claims)
Act</i> nor the relevant provisions in the <i>Local Court (Civil Claim)
Rules</i>, being Part 11 rule 1 (entering up of a default judgment), Part 12
rule 2 (entering up of a judgment following a confession) and
Part 12 rule 3
(entering up of a judgment following an agreement as to judgment) has
application otherwise than in the case of a
judgment in favour of a party for a
specified amount of money or for damages to be assessed or for some other
positive relief (for
example, in respect to detention of goods). 
<P>

52   	But, were there to have been provision for entry of an
order, such an entry of the Consent Orders Terms of Settlement, and
the
certified copy of such entry by the Registrar, would have placed beyond doubt
the entitlement of the applicant defendants to
rely on the ground of <i>res
judicata</i> in resisting the claim of the plaintiff and in asserting their
entitlement to have the plaintiff's claim against them dismissed.

<P>

53   	Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the concept of <i>res
judicata</i> is applicable not merely to a judgment for payment of money by one
party to another but (consistently with the principle expressed
in <i>Ashun
</i>and<i> Chamberlain</i>) is equally applicable to an order for the dismissal
of a claim brought by a moving party against a party in the position of a
defendant.

<P>

54   	In those circumstances, therefore, I am satisfied that the
submissions of the plaintiff upon the ground of <i>res judicata</i> do not
require the existence of some document of the nature contemplated by section 31
of the <i>Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act. </i>
<P>

55   	The conclusion which I have just expressed is of itself
sufficient to dispose of the present application in favour of the
defendants.
<P>

<b>(c)	<i>Abandonment </i></b>
<P>

56   	Where an abandonment is stated on the prescribed notice of
cross-claim, section 15(4)(b) of the <i>Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</i>
provides
<P>

[J]udgment upon the cross-claim shall be in full discharge of all demands in
respect of the defendant's cause of action.
<P>

57   	Section 14 of the Act provides in identical terms for
abandonment of the excess (that is, the amount by which the amount of
a claim
exceeds the limit of the monetary jurisdiction of the Local Court). The
foregoing provisions are replicated in other inferior
courts (see, for example,
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act </i>1973</a>, section 50). (The concept, and consequences, of
abandonment of the amount of a claim in excess of the monetary jurisdictional
limit
of a court was considered by Jordan CJ in <i>Segur v Franklin</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1934/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] NSWStRp 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2051%20WN%20%28NSW%29%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934)
51 WN (NSW) 31</a> at 32.) Abandonment of the excess is the price that has to be
paid by a litigant who wishes to litigate a cause of action in an inferior
court. 
<P>

58   	In Local Court proceedings 618 of 1993 a verdict was given
for the cross-defendant (the present third defendant) on the cross-claim
by
Terms of Settlement Consent Orders. It was submitted by the present applicants
that that verdict constitutes a "judgment upon
the cross-claim" for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15(4)(b).</a> In consequence, therefore, it was submitted on
behalf of the present applicants that Queensboro cannot in the present
proceedings
in the Supreme Court pursue claims which it formally abandoned six
years ago in the Local Court.
<P>

59   	The plaintiff submitted, however, that the abandonment and
the consent orders in the Local Court did not have the effect for
which the
applicants contend. 
<P>

60   	I have already expressed my conclusion as to the effect of
the deed and the consequent <i>res judicata</i> which has arisen. Those
conclusions have application to the submissions of the applicant defendants in
respect to the abandonment
by the plaintiff of its cause of action in the Local
Court, and the consequential effect of that abandonment upon the present
proceedings
in the Supreme Court. 
<P>

61   	Nevertheless, the plaintiff submitted, not only in regard
to the asserted abandonment of its claim by the plaintiff (which
abandonment
would be a further ground entitling the applicants to dismissal of the present
proceedings), but also in regard to the
grounds relied upon by the applicants
in respect to the deed and in respect to <i>res judicata</i>, that the
applicants, by their conduct, have waived any entitlement to the relief which
they now seek. 
<P>

62   	In this regard it was submitted by the plaintiff that if
the deed and the outcome of the proceedings in the Local Court were
to have had
the effect now asserted by the applicants they would have taken steps to have
the proceedings dismissed. It pointed to
the failure of the applicant
defendants to do so for a period of some six years, either by the proffering to
the plaintiff of a form
of consent order for dismissal of the present
proceedings, or by the making of an application of the nature of the present
application
for dismissal of the proceedings. (I would interpolate that it is
appropriate here to observe that the proceedings appear to have
been
characterised by substantial inactivity on the part of both the plaintiff and
the defendants.) 
<P>

63   	Instead, the defendants took further steps in the present
proceedings, including the provision of further and better particulars
of their
amended defence on 7 April 1994 and the filing of a notice of change of
solicitor on 11 August 1997. It was submitted on
behalf of the plaintiff that
the foregoing conduct by the applicants precluded them from the relief which
they now seek. 
<P>

64   	The plaintiff in this regard relied upon what was
described as the doctrine of conventional estoppel. 
<P>

65   	That doctrine (also referred to as estoppel by convention)
was considered by the English Court of Appeal (constituted by Lord
Denning MR,
Everleigh and Brandon LJJ) in <i>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co. v
Texas Commerce International Bank Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20QB%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 QB 84.</a>
<P>

66   	Brandon LJ at 130 - 131 contrasted the kind of estoppel in
the case before him (described as estoppel by convention) with
the usual kind
of estoppel in pais "based on a representation made by A to B and acted on by B
to his detriment". His Lordship continued,

<P>

It is rather the kind of estoppel which is described by Spencer Bower and
Turner, <i>Estoppel by Representation</i>, 3 ed (1977), 157 - 160, as estoppel
by convention. The authors of that work say of this kind of estoppel, at
157:
<P>

This form of estoppel is founded, not upon a representation of fact made by a
representor and believed by a representee, but on
an agreed statement of facts
the truth of which has been assumed, by the convention of the parties, as the
basis of a transaction
into which they are about to enter. When the parties
have acted in their transaction upon the agreed assumption that a given state
of facts is to be accepted between them as true, then as regards that
transaction each will be estopped as against the other from
questioning the
truth of the statement of facts so assumed.
<P>

67   	It is also relevant to this reliance by the plaintiff upon
the doctrine of conventional estoppel to observe that a necessary
element in
the application of such doctrine is detriment to the party in the position of
the present plaintiff. In <i>Legione v Hately</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20152%20CLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 152 CLR 406</a> Mason and
Deane JJ said, at 437,
<P>

[A] person will not be estopped from departing from an assumption or a
representation "unless, as a result of adopting it as the
basis of action or
inaction, the other party will have placed himself in a position of material
disadvantage if departure from the
assumption be permitted" (per Dixon J in
<i>Thompson v Palmer </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2049%20CLR%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 49 CLR 507</a> at 547; and see <i>Tool Metal
Manufacturing Co Limited v Tungsten Electric Co Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201%20WLR%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1 WLR, 763</a> -
764; <i>Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Goldmines Limited, </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2059%20CLR%20641" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 59 CLR 641</a> at
674 - 677; <i>Fontana N.V. v Mautner </i>(1979) 254 Est Gaz LR 199). Again, we
are of the view that this general rule is applicable to any doctrine of
promissory estoppel
(see <i>Ajayi v RT Briscoe (Nigeria) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%201%20WLR%201330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 1 WLR
1330</a>; Spencer Bower and Turner, <i>Estoppel by Representation, </i>3 ed (1977),
391 - 394.
<P>

68   	In the instant case there was no detriment to the
plaintiff in consequence of the failure of the applicants to proffer some
form
of consent order for dismissal of the proceedings or in consequence of the
furnishing by the applicants of further and better
particulars of the amended
defence or the filing by the applicants of a notice of change of solicitor. The
plaintiff did not act
in any way at all, in consequence of the foregoing
absence of conduct or the foregoing positive steps on the part of the
applicants,
except to receive answers to a request for particulars which it had
sought. 
<P>

69   	For the foregoing reason, being the absence of any
detriment to the plaintiff, I am satisfied that the doctrine of conventional
estoppel does not have application to the circumstances of the instant case,
and does not preclude the applicants from the relief
which they presently
seek.
<P>

70   	The concept of estoppel by convention was also considered
by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in <i>Lee v Furno Holdings Pty
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2033%20NSWLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 33 NSWLR 404</a>, where Meagher JA, at 407, referred to 
<P>

the type of estoppel by convention which was formulated by Dixon J, as he then
was, in <i>Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2059%20CLR%20641" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 59 CLR 641</a>
and <i>Thompson v Palmer </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2049%20CLR%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 49 CLR 507</a> and more recently reaffirmed by
the High Court in a series of cases of which <i>Commonwealth of Australia v
Verwayen </i>(1990) 170 CLR 394 is perhaps the leading example. 
<P>

71   	Handley and Sheller JJA agreed with the foregoing reasons
of Meagher JA for the recognition in the case before them of an
estoppel by
convention. (See also, as to the application of principles in relation to
estoppel, both estoppel in pais and estoppel
by convention, the decision of the
Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <i>Commonwealth of Australia v
Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited</i> (at 190 - 192 per Black CJ and Foster J.)
<P>

72   	It was submitted by the plaintiff that the defendants by
their conduct (by taking of positive steps in the proceedings and
by failure to
seek to have the proceedings dismissed) have waived whatever entitlement they
might otherwise have had to the relief
now sought. In this regard the plaintiff
relied upon the decision of the High Court of Australia in <i>Commonwealth of
Australia v Verwayen</i> (1990) 170 CLR 394. 
<P>

73   	In <i>Verwayen</i> Mason CJ (who, however, as it will be
appreciated, was one of the minority) said, at 406,
<P>

According to its strict legal connotation, waiver is an intentional act done
with knowledge whereby a person abandons a right by
acting in a manner
inconsistent with that right: <i>Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance
Company Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1920] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2028%20CLR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 28 CLR 305</a> at 326; <i>Grundt v Great Boulder Pty
Gold Mines Limited</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 658. However, the better view is that,
apart from estoppel and new agreement, abandonment of a right occurs only where
the person
waiving the right is entitled to alternative rights inconsistent
with one another, such as the right to insist on performance of
a contract and
the right to rescind for essential breach: see <i>Kammins Company v Zenith
Investments </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20850" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 850</a> at 883. This category of waiver is an example of
the doctrine of election. 
<P>

Another category of waiver is one in which a person is prevented from
asserting, in response to a claim against him, a particular
defence or
objection which would otherwise have been available. Here waiver is said to
arise when the person agrees not raise the
particular defence of so conducts
himself as to be estopped from raising it: see <i>Kammins </i>at 883. 
<P>

74   	In <i>Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Company
Limited </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1920] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2028%20CLR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 28 CLR 305</a> Isaacs J (in delivering the written judgment of
the Court, constituted by Knox CJ, Isaacs and Starke JJ) conveniently collected
a
number of earlier decisions concerning estoppel and waiver, and said, at 326
(in a passage which was quoted with approval by Gaudron
J in <i>Verwayen,
</i>at 481), 
<P>

"Waiver" is a doctrine of some arbitrariness introduced by the law to prevent a
man in certain circumstances from taking up two
inconsistent positions (see per
James LJ in <i>Pilcher v Rawlins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7%20LRCh%20App%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">7 Ch. App. 259</a> at 268f). It is a
conclusion of law when the necessary facts are established. It looks, however,
chiefly to the conduct and position
of the person who is said to have waived,
in order to see whether he has "approbated" so as to prevent him from
"reprobating" ---
in English terms, whether he has elected to get some
advantage to which he would not otherwise have been entitled, so as to deny
to
him a later election to the contrary (see per Lord Shaw in <i>Pitman v Crum
Ewing </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%20AC%20217" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] AC 217</a> at 239). His knowledge is necessary, or he cannot be
said to have approbated or elected. 
<P>

75   	In <i>Presmist Pty Limited v Turner Corporation Pty
Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%20478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 478</a> Cole J (as he then was), at 486, held that
there was no waiver of a contractual provision because there was no "specific,
conscious,
demonstrated surrender of the right.... to cancel the contract". 
<P>

76   	It is abundantly clear in the instant case, firstly, that
the conduct of the defendants in providing particulars did not constitute
an
intentional waiver of whatever rights might have flowed from the deed and the
terms of settlement and consent orders in the Local
Court. Further, that the
position adopted by the defendants in achieving the resolution of the Local
Court proceedings and the determination
of the rights of themselves and the
plaintiff by way of the deed did not result in the defendants "taking up two
inconsistent positions".
The defendants at the time at which they furnished the
particulars were still parties to litigation which at that stage was on foot.
They were not the moving parties in that litigation. They were on the receiving
end of claims by the plaintiff.
<P>

77   	Further, in relation to the assertion by the plaintiff
that the defendants have waived their rights to rely upon the deed
and the
verdict in the Local Court, it is a characteristic of a right susceptible of
waiver that it is introduced solely for the
benefit of one party (see
<i>Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen,</i> at 425 per Brennan J.) (I would
here also observe that in <i>Verwayen</i> the considerations of the principles
relating to waiver were essentially directed to the question of the asserted
waiver by the Commonwealth
of its right to rely upon a statutory limitation
provision --- a situation which does not arise in the instant case.)
<P>

78   	Further, waiver is an intentional act which can be
effected by a party only with informed knowledge of that party's rights.
A
party cannot, as it were, be held to have unintentionally waived its rights.
The letter of particulars upon which the plaintiff
relies in support of its
assertion that the defendants have waived their right to rely upon the deed of
release and upon the effect
given to that deed by the terms of settlement and
consent orders made in the Local Court does not indicate any intention on the
part
of the defendants to abandon their rights in respect to the deed and the
Local Court consent orders.
<P>

79   	Further, any asserted waiver on the part of the defendants
cannot have effect contrary to the operation of section 15 of the
<i>Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Act</i>. That section not only operates for the benefit
of individual parties, but also has a public effect (in relation, for example,
to
the public consequences of the judgment (sections 7, 15(7)) and the
limitation upon the monetary jurisdictional limit of the Local
Court (sections
12, 15(3) and (4)).
<P>

80   	For completeness, I would refer to the decision of the
House of Lords in <i>Republic of India v India Steamship Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC
410</a>, which was relied upon by the plaintiff. There is nothing in that decision
(in particular, in the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley,
at 413f) which
persuades me that the applicants are precluded from relying upon the principle
of <i>res judicata</i>, or that the doctrine of estoppel by convention or the
doctrine of waiver deprives them of the relief which they presently claim.
To
the extent that anything in that decision is inconsistent with the foregoing
decisions of the High Court of Australia to which
I have earlier herein
referred concerning the application of those principles, I am of course bound
to apply the decisions of the
High Court rather than that of the House of
Lords.
<P>

81   	In my conclusion there has been no waiver on the part of
the applicants.
<P>

82   	I should also refer to a number of other submissions made
by the plaintiff in resistance to the present application. 
<P>

83   	It will be recognised that Butler Pollnow Pty Limited, the
first defendant to the present proceedings, was not a party to
the Local Court
proceedings. Accordingly, so it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, no
<i>res judicata</i> could arise from the consent orders to the effect that a
continuation of the claims of the plaintiff against that defendant could
be
precluded.
<P>

84   	It was further submitted that in the present proceedings
Queensboro sues in its capacity as representative of the members
of various
investment partnerships, whereas in the proceedings in the Local Court
Queensboro sued in its own right, that is, in its
personal capacity. Thus, so
the argument ran, the abandonment in excess of the jurisdiction of the Local
Court and the consent orders
would, at their highest (that is, at their best
for the present applicants) only have effected a release in respect of
Queensboro's
own entitlements, and could not discharge claims brought by that
company on behalf of the members of the partnerships as a whole.
That such was
the case provides yet a further reason why, according to the plaintiff, the
deed could not have contemplated the release
which the applicant now asserts.

<P>

85   	Whether the plaintiff brought the proceedings in its
personal capacity (to the extent that a corporation can be regarded as
being
able so to do) or whether it brought the proceedings in its capacity as
representative of various investment partnerships does
not seem to me to have
any effect whatsoever upon the consequences of the deed, the <i>res
judicata</i> arising from the orders of the Local Court or the abandonment by
the plaintiff in the Local Court proceedings. 
<P>

86   	The plaintiff also submitted, in resistance to the relief
sought by the defendants in the notice of motion, that the plaintiff
is
entitled in the substantive proceedings to maintain its defence to the
cross-claim brought against it by the defendants, and that
the effect of that
entitlement would be to make futile any order for dismissal of the substantive
claim because, as I understand
the reasoning of the plaintiff in this regard,
the same issues would still require to be litigated upon the cross-claim and
the defence
to that cross-claim.
<P>

87   	I do not consider that the possibility that the present
applicants may, in the event that the plaintiff's claim against them
is
dismissed, persist in their cross-claim against the plaintiff and that the
plaintiff should in such circumstance be entitled to
resist that cross-claim
can be determinative of the fate of the present application. In this regard it
should be observed that there
are thirteen cross-defendants to the cross-claim
of the present applicants, the plaintiff being only one of those
cross-defendants.
Further, the relief sought in that cross-claim is essentially
by way of damages, and an indemnity by the first cross-defendant (the
plaintiff) in respect to a possible liability of the first cross-claimant (the
first defendant). 
<P>

88   	The absence of identicality between the parties to the
cross-claim and the present parties, and between the relief sought
therein and
the substantive relief claimed by the plaintiff against the present applicants
leads me to the conclusion that any present
entitlement of the plaintiff to
persist in its defences to the cross-claim should not preclude the applicant
defendants from the
orders which they presently seek.
<P>

89   	The plaintiff also submitted that any settlement reached
in what was described as the Auditor's proceedings did not affect
the validity
of the present proceedings in the Supreme Court. I have already recorded that
the present applicants were not parties
to the Auditors proceedings. As I
understand it, they do not rely upon the outcome of those proceedings as a
substantive ground in
their present application. 
<P>

90   	It follows from my foregoing conclusions that I am
satisfied that each of the grounds relied upon by the applicant defendants
(the
deed of settlement and release, which compromised the Local Court proceedings;
the Lcoal Court judgment, which gives rise to
<i>res judicata</i>; and the
abandonment by the plaintiff, under section 15 (4) of the <i>Local Court (Civil
Claims) Act</i>, which resulted in the judgment against the plaintiff on its
cross-claim being a full discharge of all demands in respect of the
causes of
action asserted by the plaintiff in the Supreme Court proceedings) entitles the
applicant defendants to dismissal of the
proceedings brought by the plaintiff
against them. 
<P>

91   	In addition, I am satisfied that the terms of the deed
between the parties, (in particular, clause 5 of the deed) have the
effect that
the present claim of the plaintiff is terminated and defeated by the deed, and
that the plaintiff is barred from asserting
that claim.
<P>

92   	I have already recorded that I am not satisfied that, in
the circumstances of this case, and for the reasons that I have expressed,
there has been any waiver by the defendants of their entitlement to rely upon
the foregoing terms of the deed. Further, I am not
satisfied that the plaintiff
has established that the defendants are estopped from relying upon the deed.
<P>

93   	It follows from each of my foregoing conclusions that the
claim of the plaintiff against the applicant defendants must be
dismissed. 
<P>

94   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the proceedings be dismissed as against the first and third
defendants.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the first and third defendants
of the notice of motion filed by the first and third
defendants on 25 November
1998 and of the proceedings after 3 December 1993 (the costs of the notice of
motion to include only one
day of hearing), and that otherwise there be no
order as to costs in the proceedings by  the plaintiff against those
defendants.
<P>
