<P>

<b>JUDGMENT  (Exhortation to jury)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   Mr Barker of Queens Counsel for the plaintiff has drawn to my
attention the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal
of 5 November 1998 in<b>
<i>The Queen v Pantoja</i></b> and the decision of that Court to the effect
that, in the circumstances of that trial, where an indication has been sent to
the trial
Judge that the jury was unable to reach a verdict and that any
further deliberation was futile, it was nonetheless appropriate that
a
direction in accordance with<b> <i>Black v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 71</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20179%20CLR%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 179 CLR 44</a>,
be given.
<P>

2	The note of<b> <i>Pantoja</i></b> is in vol 5 Number 11 of the <i>Criminal
Law News</i> but is sufficiently detailed to persuade me, leaving to one side
any difference between a criminal and a civil trial, that the circumstances
with which the Court of Criminal Appeal was concerned are starkly different to
that confronting this Court.
<P>

3	Yesterday I did give an exhortation to the jury in the course of which from
time to time I used expressions that are contained
in what is known as the
<b><i>Black</i></b> direction. This morning, subject to anything that is
immediately brought to my attention by the jury upon its being brought into
court, I merely propose to request that they give further consideration to the
issues, bear in mind what I said to them yesterday
after lunch, and to remind
them that they are free to seek any further directions that might assist
them.
