<i>Thursday, 21 October 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2003/98	CHERYL ANN FLINN &amp; ORS   -v-   AUDREY EDITH FEARNE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>. By summons filed on 9 April 1998 the plaintiffs, Cheryl
Ann Flinn, Wendy Kay Fritsch, Toni Patricia Roose and Janelle Sylvia Lancaster,
claim an order for provision for their maintenance and advancement in life out
of the estate of their late father, Garry William
Fearne (to whom I shall refer
as "the deceased"), and, further, an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23</a> on the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>, "designating as notional estate certain property
which was the subject of a prescribed transaction".
<P>

2   	The deceased died on 8 November 1996. He left a will dated
7 November 1996. By that will the deceased appointed the defendant,
Audrey
Edith Fearne, as executor and gave to the defendant the entirety of his estate
absolutely. 
<P>

3   	The deceased had been married twice. The four plaintiffs
are the children of his first marriage. The deceased and his first
wife were
subsequently divorced. The defendant was the second wife of the deceased. Of
his marriage to the defendant was born another
daughter Michelle Kathleen
Fearne, who is presently aged fifteen. 
<P>

4   	The hearing of the substantive proceedings was fixed for 29
September 1999. On the day preceding that date the parties requested
that the
matter be listed before me for mention and directions. The purpose of that
mention was to enable the Court to be informed
of the fact that the actual
estate left by the deceased was not of any great significance, and that unless
there were to be designated
as notional estate of the deceased (as sought by
prayer 2 in the summons) certain assets, consisting of an omnibus business
conducted
in the environs of Wagga Wagga, there would be no fund available to
meet any order for provision to which any or all of the plaintiffs
might
ultimately establish an entitlement. 
<P>

5   	Accordingly on 28 September 1999 the plaintiffs made
application, to which the defendant consented, for the determination,
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, of a separate question before the
hearing of the substantive proceedings, such separate question
being in respect
to the existence of a prescribed transaction. 
<P>

6   	I acceded to that application and made the following
orders:
<P>

1.	I order, pursuant to Part 31 rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, that the
question set forth in the document entitled "Separate
Question" initialled by
me and filed in Court this day be decided separately from any other question in
the proceedings. 
<P>

2.	I grant leave to the plaintiffs to join such additional defendants as they
may be advised. 
<P>

7   	The Separate Question was in the following form:
<P>

Whether the deceased entered into a prescribed transaction in regard to the
property being the assets of G &amp; K Fearne Family
Trust, such that the Court
is entitled to designate any property of the G &amp; A Fearne Family Trust
notional estate of the deceased.

<P>

8   	When the matter came on for hearing on 29 September 1999
the plaintiffs by consent filed in Court an amended summons, naming
five
additional defendants, those additional defendants being the companies involved
in the conduct of the omnibus business to which
I have already referred.
<P>

9   	In accordance with the desires of the parties in that
regard, the hearing was confined to a determination of the separate question.
It was recognised that if that separate question were to be decided in the
affirmative, then it would be necessary for the matter
to be stood over for a
further hearing in relation to the question of whether or not assets should be
designated as notional estate
of the deceased, that latter question requiring
an exercise of the discretion of the Court, and requiring also a consideration
of
the substantive claims of the plaintiff (since assets should be designated
as notional estate only to the extent that there is not
available actual estate
to meet any order for provision which the Court ultimately might decide should
be made in favour of one or
more of the plaintiffs <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 28(1)</a> and (2) of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>)). 
<P>

10   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22</a> of the Act defines a prescribed transaction.
Concerning that section it has been said, "It is obvious that the legislature
has cast
the net very wide, in pursuit of its goal of providing adequate
provision in favour of eligible person": <i>Kavalle v Burbidge </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/111.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 111</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43
NSWLR 422</a> at 441 per Mason P. 
<P>

11   	Jonhold Pty Limited (one of the additional defendants
joined in the amended summons) is the trustee of the G &amp; A Fearne
Family
Trust, created by a deed of trust dated 30 December 1991. Under the terms of
that deed and in the events which have happened
the deceased was until his
death the Nominator named in that deed, being designated as such by Schedule
Five to the deed. 
<P>

12   	Under the terms of that deed the trustee has discretionary
powers to dispose of the income of the trust in favour of "nominated
beneficiaries" or "eligible beneficiaries" (each of those phrases being defined
in clause 3 of the deed) --- clause 4; and, in certain
circumstances (but only
with the consent of the deceased, as the Nomonator), the capital --- clause 19
(p) and (u).
<P>

13   	As the Nominator the deceased during his lifetime had the
power to remove the trustee from its position as trustee and to
appoint any
person as trustee in its place, and to appoint any person as an additional
trustee (clause 13). Further, the power to
designate "nominated beneficiaries"
from the class of "eligible beneficiaries" reposed in the deceased as the
Nominator (clause 3(h)).
<P>

14   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that the
effect of the foregoing provisions of the deed was to give to the deceased
<i>de facto</i>, although indirect, control of the trust and of its assets.
Further, that in the exercise of his powers under the deed the deceased
as the
Nominator could have procured the transfer to himself of the corpus of the
trust assets, by finding and appointing a trustee
who would in that regard have
been prepared to do his bidding. 
<P>

15   	However, the deceased did not before his death exercise
the foregoing powers to cause the corpus of the trust assets to be
transferred
to him. 
<P>

16   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that the
failure of the deceased to exercise that <i>de facto</i> control of the trust
in order to procure a transfer to himself of the corpus of the trust assets
constituted a prescribed transaction
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(a)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a></i>. Upon the deceased's death that power of control passed to
the defendant, the office of Nominator, held by the deceased during his
lifetime, thereupon devolving upon her. 
<P>

17   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that the
conduct of the deceased in failing to exercise what was described by
the
plaintiffs as being the <i>de facto </i>power to appoint, or dispose of,
property, before his death in such a way as to cause the corpus of the trust
assets to be transferred
to him (and thus to form part of his estate upon his
death) constituted a prescribed transaction of the nature described in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
22(1)(a)</a> of the Act, and also of the nature described more particularly in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(4)(a)(ii)</a> of the Act. 
<P>

18   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22(1)</a> provides, relevantly,
<P>

A person shall be deemed to enter into a prescribed transaction if ---
<P>

(a)	on or after the appointed day he does, directly or indirectly, or omits to
do, any act, as a result of which -
<P>

(i)	property becomes held by another person (whether or not as trustee); or
<P>

(ii)	property becomes subject to a trust,
<P>

whether or not the property becomes in either case so held immediately; and
<P>

...
<P>

19   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22(4)</a> provides, relevantly, 
<P>

In particular and without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a person
shall, for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), be deemed
to do, or omit to do,
an act, as a result of which property becomes held by another person or subject
to a trust if ---
<P>

(a)	he is entitled, on or after the appointed day, to exercise a power to
appoint, or dispose of, property which is not in his estate
but the power is
not exercised before he ceases (by reason of death or the occurrence of any
other event) to be so entitled and,
as a result of the omission to exercise the
power and of his death or the occurrence of the other event ---
<P>

(i)	the property becomes held by another person (whether or not as trustee) or
subject to a trust (whether or not the property becomes
in either case so held
immediately); or
<P>

(ii)	another person becomes (whether or not immediately) or, if he was
previously entitled, continues to be, entitled to exercise
the power;
<P>

...
<P>

20   	Whilst recognising that whatever powers the deceased might
have had under the deed to effect a disposition of assets of the
trust were
indirect powers, the plaintiffs relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <i>Kavalle v Burbidge</i> (in particular, the judgment of Mason P, with whom
Meagher JA agreed). 
<P>

21   	The President said, at 451,
<P>

A "power to...dispose of property" is not a technical term of law. In context
it must mean something more than a traditional power
of appointment, assuming
that the latter concept were limited in any presently relevant way.
<P>

22   	His Honour then proceeded to consider a number of relevant
judicial authorities.
<P>

23   	It must, however, be recognised that the decision in
<i>Kavalle v Burbidge</i> was essentially a decision upon its own facts,
dealing with the legal rights of a testator in the context of the law of
Liechtenstein,
and the specific legal powers vested in the testator in that
case (see the judgment of Mason P at 451E), which are to be distinguished
from
the powers vested in the deceased in the instant case. Whereas, in <i>Kavalle v
Burbidge</i> there was a legal duty imposed upon Mr Defago, the trustee, to act
in accordance with the directions of the testator, in the instant
case there
was no such legal duty imposed upon the trustee to act in accordance with the
directions of the deceased.
<P>

24   	There is no doubt, in the instant case, that the deceased
during his lifetime, in his capacity as the Nominator, had the power,
to remove
the trustee named in the deed and to appoint another trustee of the G &amp; A
Fearne Family Trust. It seems to me, however,
that that power is very different
from the power of <i>de facto</i> control of the trust asserted by the
plaintiffs to have reposed in the deceased. Indeed, the entire basis of that
assertion of <i>de facto</i> control appears to depend upon assumptions,
firstly, that the deceased would be able to find another potential trustee who
would
be amenable to the dictates of the deceased, and, secondly, that any such
entity or person, when appointed trustee, would disregard
his duties as a
trustee (see <i>Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia, </i>6 ed (1997), 51,
paragraph 265; 409, paragraphs 1609ff). 
<P>

25   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the
deceased held his power in a fiduciary capacity and that he could exercise
it
only in such a fiduciary capacity. Whether or not that was so, it is abundantly
clear that the deceased could not have properly
given, and the trustee could
not have properly received, a direction that the trustee dispose of the trust
property. The most that
the deceased could have done was to remove the
nominated trustee and to appoint as a new trustee a person or entity whom the
deceased
might have expected would act in accordance with his direction. (It
was suggested on behalf of the plaintiffs that the deceased could
even have
appointed as such new trustee a company controlled by the plaintiff.) 
<P>

26   	Nevertheless, there could be no certainty that either the
original trustee or any replacement thereof appointed by the deceased
would
necessarily have acted in accordance with such a direction by the deceased,
since the conduct of the trustee, were he merely
to have acted as directed by
the deceased, without independently carrying out his duties and exercising his
discretion (in the manner
described in the foregoing passages from
<i>Jacobs</i>), would have constituted on the part of the trustee a clear
breach of trust. (If the deceased had appointed as a replacement trustee
a
company which he himself controlled, it is possible that any disposition of
trust property to the deceased by such a trustee would
have been in
contravention of clause 18(a)(ii) of the deed.) 
<P>

27   	It seems to me that a clear distinction must be drawn
between, on the one hand, the conduct of the deceased in failing to
exercise
his powers as the Nominator, and, on the other hand, the conduct of the
trustee. It is all very well for the plaintiffs
to say that the deceased could
have dismissed the trustee and could have appointed a fresh trustee who would
be malleable and would
act in accordance with the wishes of the deceased.
Nevertheless, the essential question is whether the deceased himself entered
into
a prescribed transaction, not whether the trustee, by his failure to do
anything, allowed the property to remain subject to a trust.

<P>

28   	It will be appreciated that the only omission of the
nature referred to in the description of a prescribed transaction contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)</a> to which the plaintiffs can point is the omission on the part of
the deceased before his death to remove the present trustee and
to appoint as a
replacement trustee some other person or entity whom the deceased might have
expected would act in accordance with
his wishes.
<P>

29   	The foregoing observation in relation to subsection (1) of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> has equal application to subsection (4) of that section. Further,
the submissions of the plaintiffs concerning that latter subsection
disregard
the introductory phrase "he is entitled" appearing in paragraph (a) thereof. In
the instant case the deceased was not "entitled...
to appoint, or dispose of,
property". The extent of his entitlement was limited to his power as the
Nominator to remove from office
the trustee and to appoint a replacement
trustee.
<P>

30   	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the deceased entered
into a prescribed transaction in regard to the property being the
assets of the
G &amp; A Fearne Family Trust. It follows, therefore, that the separate
question will be answered in the negative.
<P>

31   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I answer as follows the separate question ordered to be decided separately
from any other question in the proceedings: No.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiffs pay the costs of the defendant of the hearing in
respect to the aforesaid separate question.
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the defendant to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>

4.	I stand the matter over to Monday, 25 October 1999 before the Registrar, for
directions.
