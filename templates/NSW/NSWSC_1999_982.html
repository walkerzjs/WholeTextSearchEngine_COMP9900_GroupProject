TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD (ACN 060 576 025) &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1   	The fifth defendant in this matter granted to the first
defendant an option to purchase land in West Botany Street, Rockdale
by a deed
of option dated 8 June 1999.  Under the deed, for the grant of the option it
paid a consideration of $100,000.  The option
was to be exercised by 31 July
1999.  The deposit payable under the contract which would come into existence
on exercise of the option
was $250,000 and, on exercise, the first defendant
was to top up the $100,000 already paid as the option fee by a further $150,000
to constitute the $250,000 deposit under the contract.  There certainly was
some move to exercise the option at the material time.
 There is a dispute
between the parties as to whether the contract ever came into existence.
Certainly the first defendant, which
was apparently unable to provide the
additional $150,000 itself, bargained with the plaintiff for the plaintiff to
provide the $150,000
and ultimately to take the benefit of the contract.
Whatever did or did not occur as to the effectuation of the contract, the
plaintiff
paid to the fifth defendant the sum of $150,000 for the purpose
indicated above.  Subsequently, the first defendant and the fifth
defendant
settled the controversies between them by means of a deed dated 13 August 1999.
They take the stance that there is no contract
in force and, there is no doubt
that, pursuant to that deed, the $150,000 was refunded by the fifth defendant
to the first defendant.
 The plaintiff claims that the money should now be paid
to a stakeholder to abide the result of the proceedings.
<P>

<center>o0o</center>
<P>


<P>

2   	Yesterday I granted an injunction ex parte restraining the
first, second, third and fourth defendants (`'the defendants'')
from dealing
with that sum of $150,000.  The matter returned to Court today, Mr Armfield of
counsel appearing for the defendants.
 He says that although the money refunded
by the fifth defendant to the first defendant has not been placed into the
solicitors'
trust account, it is held by the solicitors in the form of a cheque
which has not been negotiated.  The plaintiff now seeks that
those moneys be
paid into Court to abide the further order of the Court.  The defendants'
counsel has cooperated in settling a proposed
form of order to achieve that
end, but has informed the Court that he does not have instructions to consent
to the order.  However,
he offers no opposition to the making of the order in
the form so agreed and that order will be made.  The usual undertaking as to
damages is given to the Court by Mr M B Evans of counsel on behalf of the
plaintiff.  Upon that undertaking, there will be an order
in accordance with
the short minutes of order initialled by me and placed with the papers.
<P>

3   	Now that the substantive matter has been disposed of, Mr
Armfield, of counsel for the defendants, says that the defendants
ought have
their costs of the motion for the Mareva injunction on the basis that no proper
requirement was made by the plaintiff
of the defendants to account for the
whereabouts of the moneys or to give an undertaking in relation to them before
ex parte relief
was sought.  Mr M B Evans, of counsel for the plaintiff, says
that the plaintiff should have its costs of the motion including the
ex parte
application, or at least the usual order, that the costs be the plaintiff's
costs in the proceedings.
<P>

4   	I have now heard argument concerning the costs.  By about
20 August 1999, it would seem that the plaintiff was possessed of
knowledge of
the refund of the $150,000 being made.  Mr Armfield says that whilst various
other matters concerning the litigation
were passing between the parties in
late August and early September this year, the question of the whereabouts of
the refunded $150,000
or any fear that it might be being dealt with in an
untoward way, was not raised by the plaintiff with the defendants.  However,
in
a letter written by the plaintiff's solicitors to the defendants' solicitors on
2 September 1999, the plaintiff enquired as follows:
<P>

"Please also confirm whether your firm holds our client's $150,000. If you do,
please indicate if you are entitled to hold the amount
in your trust account
pending the outcome of the hearing."
<P>

In a letter dated 3 September 1999 the defendants' solicitors replied:
<P>

"We are instructed that in so far as the $150,000 is concerned, this sum is not
to be held in trust pending the outcome of the hearing."
<P>

On the same day the plaintiff's solicitor again wrote:
<P>

"We note you have not answered our question, do you hold the $150,000 belonging
to your client in your trust account? Please respond
to this question as a
matter of urgency."
<P>

The defendants' solicitor replied by a further letter of the same date which is
as follows:
<P>

"We refer to your letter dated 2 September 1999 and advise we do not hold the
$150,000 in our trust account". 
<P>

Without further warning to or requirement of the defendants, the plaintiff
moved the Court yesterday for relief of a Mareva nature
and an order was made
ex parte up to and including today forbidding the disposal by the first
defendant of the $150,000.
<P>

5   	Concerning the correspondence, Mr Armfield says that his
clients were asked simple questions to which they gave direct answers,
that
those answers were not sufficient to raise alarm, particularly in a situation
where there had been a course of dealings between
the parties up to that point,
and certainly not sufficient to justify the peremptory application for a Mareva
injunction without
notice.  It is now stated by Mr Armfield and it is not in
doubt that, whilst the $150,000 was not his solicitor's trust account,
it was,
at all material times, in the form of the cheque by which it had been refunded
by the fifth defendant to the first defendant,
inside the file of the solicitor
for the defendants.
<P>

6   	I am unable to agree with Mr Armfield that there was
nothing in the defendants' conduct to raise apprehension on the part of
the
plaintiff.  It is true that the questions asked on behalf of the plaintiff may
have been better asked.  Mr Armfield says that
it simply was not understood
what was meant or sought by the questions, but I must say that I should have
thought that their fairly
plain meaning to a recipient was that the plaintiff
was concerned as to the whereabouts of the money.  Whilst it may be said that
a
wider question should have been asked, it would have been very easy for the
defendants' solicitor to reply that the cheque was
not in his trust account but
being held in his file; to give a reassurance that it was not intended to be
disbursed by the clients;
and enquiring what the agreed regime pending the
hearing of the proceedings might be.  It was at all times quite easy to come to
an agreement concerning an interlocutory arrangement, as demonstrated by the
course which has been adopted today to hold the funds
pending the hearing of
the proceedings.  Mr Armfield also draws attention to the fact that relief was
obtained against all four of
his clients, whereas in his submission what
evidence there was related only to the first defendant into whose possession it
was shown
that the $150,000 had come.  However, the second, third and fourth
defendants are directors of the first defendant and appear in
the proceedings
by the same solicitors and counsel as the first defendant.
<P>

7   	In those circumstances I am certainly not inclined to order
costs in the defendants' favour.  Particularly in the case of Mareva
relief,
once a plaintiff has a real apprehension that a fund may be being dealt with in
an inappropriate way, then it is not surprising
if that plaintiff applies
without further notice for relief to ensure that the fund is held, without
giving a warning which would
enable defendants who did have improper intentions
in relation to the money to effectuate those intentions before an order could
be obtained from the Court.  I should add that, in the event, there is no
evidence that there was any such intention on the part
of any of Mr Armfield's
clients.  Nonetheless, in my view the course of action taken by the plaintiff
was not at all unreasonable
and I certainly do not propose to order costs
against it. 
<P>

8   	Mr Evans presses me for costs in favour of the successful
plaintiff in the usual course.  However, bearing in mind that it
turns out that
on the evidence the funds were not under actual threat at any time and that the
plaintiff's own questions were limited
in scope, were not entirely clear and
may have led to misunderstanding, I think that the appropriate course in all
the circumstances
is that there should be no order as to the costs of the ex
parte application or the motion today for the continuation of relief.
<P>
