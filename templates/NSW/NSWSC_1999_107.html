<P>

DECISION: 
<P>

Jury's request for provision of transcript of Crown's opening address and of
the accused's opening statement allowed.
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	In this trial, the Crown prosecutor gave an opening address to the jury early
in the day on Wednesday, 17 February 1999.  That
was followed by an opening
statement by counsel for the accused.  On Friday 19 February, several Crown
witnesses had been called
and several remained to be called.
<P>

2	It was at this stage of the trial that a written request was received from a
member of the jury, as follows:
<P>

	"I request a transcript of the opening addresses by both counsel, giving an
overview of the prosecution and defence, and the names
of all witnesses.
<P>

Juryman 27-18-044".
<P>

Juror  27-18-044 is the foreman of the jury  but, as will appear, nothing seems
to me to turn on that.
<P>

3	Before the jury was empanelled the Crown prosecutor had read out the names of
the Crown's proposed witnesses.  Several of them
were again referred to by name
in the course of the Crown prosecutor's opening address.
<P>

4	The Crown prosecutor's opening address was conventional.  It commenced as
follows:
<P>

	"Ladies and gentlemen, it is, as his Honour told you, my function at this
stage of the proceedings to give you a brief outline
or a potted version, as it
were, of the evidence which I anticipate will be led for the Crown in this
trial.  I use the word `anticipate'
because I don't give evidence in the trial.
I call witnesses.  They give their evidence to you in the witness box and they
may very
well produce certain exhibits which will also come your way for your
consideration."
<P>

Then followed a resume of the evidence intended to be called.  The Crown case
as outlined was that Peter Mitris was believed by
the accused and a colleague
to have failed to account for a consignment of illicit drugs, that the accused
and his colleague had
beaten Mitris to death in retribution and that the
accused had arranged for disposal of the body from a launch, and that the body
had not been found. The Crown prosecutor concluded his opening address as
follows:
<P>

	"Members of the jury that is a basic outline of the case.  Please don't make
up your minds yet.  You haven't heard any of the evidence.
 It is all very well
for me to tell you what I think will fall from the lips of the witnesses.  It
is quite another thing for the
witnesses to come along, give their evidence and
you be the judge as to what you make of them, not only what they say but the
way
in which they say things.  That is your function and yours alone.
<P>

	Can I just repeat before I resume my seat, that the very, very important words
that his Honour said to you at the start - and I
have no difficulty with you
hearing them from me as the Crown Prosecutor - the Crown brings the charges,
the Crown has to prove them.
 The accused, as he sits in court, comes here with
what is called the presumption of innocence, that is, he is presumed to be
innocent
until the Crown, with such evidence as it is able to muster, is able
to convince each and every one of you beyond a reasonable doubt
as to his
guilt.  Until such time as we have done that, he is and remains innocent and he
does not have to say, tell or prove a thing
in that regard.  That is very
important, members of the jury.  Your Honour, I think that is all I need to say
to the jury by way
of opening."
<P>

5	In his opening statement to the jury, counsel for the accused said the
defence did not concede that Peter Mitris was dead, that,
if he is dead, he did
not die at the hands of the accused, that the accused did not take part in any
assault on Mitris as alleged,
that there was no drug debt, that the accused had
no other motive to harm Mitris, and that the accused was being framed.  Counsel
for the accused concluded his statement as follows:
<P>

	"So hopefully, members of the jury, that short address will indicate to you
where we feel or where the defence submits your attention
ought to be focused
and for you to perhaps better appreciate the significance of the evidence as it
comes to you.
<P>

	I join with the Crown in reminding you that at the end of the day it is the
Crown that must prove the guilt of the accused and
unless and until it does, he
remains not guilty."
<P>

6	On Friday 19 February 1999, I heard submissions from counsel concerning the
juror's request.  I reserved my decision.  On Monday
22 February 1999, I
announced my decision that the jury should be provided with a copy of the Crown
prosecutor's opening address
and of the opening statement made by counsel for
the accused.  I said I would give my reasons at a later time.  These are my
reasons<i>.</i>
<P>

7	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury Act 1977</a></i> was amended by the<i> Jury (Amendment) Act 1987</i>
in a number of respects.  Substantially, the amendments followed the
recommendations of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission
in its report "The
Jury in a Criminal Trial" (LRC48 1986).  The amendments included insertion of s
55C which provides as follows:
<P>

	"A copy of all or any part of the transcript of evidence at a trial or inquest
may, at the request of the jury, be supplied to
the members of the jury if the
judge or coroner considers that it is appropriate and practicable to do so."
<P>

8	It is my understanding that, prior to the 1987 amendment, juries were never
provided with a transcript of evidence.  If they were,
that was a rarity.
Juries were told that, if they wished to be reminded of any part of the
evidence, it would be read to them.  This
was frequently done, usually by the
trial judge reading the relevant evidence to the jury, sometimes at
considerable length.  I am
not aware of any practice at that time concerning
any transcript of the Crown's opening address or concerning any transcript of
an
opening statement by the accused's counsel.  To this day, there is no
universal practice in relation to the recording of opening
addresses and
opening statements.  I am sure, however, that, prior to 1987, a request for the
transcript of any such address or statement
(if available) would have been
refused, conformably with the practice in relation to transcripts of
evidence.
<P>

9	There is an inherent or implied power in this court to control its own
processes.  The power is hedged in by statute, rules of
court, precedent and
practice.  I do not doubt, however, that a judge has, apart altogether from the
operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury Act</a>,</i> the discretionary power to make
available to the jury a transcript of any part of the record of the proceedings
to the extent that
such proceedings have been conducted before them.  My
reasons for that view are as follows.  
<P>

10	The report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission to which I have
referred included the following recommendation.
<P>

	"Recommendation 49:  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury Act 1977</a> should confirm the discretionary power
of the judge to provide a copy of all or part of the transcript of evidence to
the jury in
the jury room."
<P>

This recommendation conveyed the opinion of the members of the commission that,
without the need for any specific statutory power,
a discretion to provide the
jury with transcript of evidence existed.  The members of the commission who
signed off on that report
were Mr K Mason QC (as he then was), Mr P Byrne (then
of junior counsel), Mr G James QC (as he then was), Matthews DCJ (as she then
was), Roden J (as he then was) and Mr R Sackville (as he then was).  The
opinion of these persons carries weight.  That was, as I
have said, in relation
to transcript of evidence.  
<P>

11	In <i>Lowe</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/160.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 160</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2098%20A%20Crim%20R%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 98 A Crim R 300</a>, a District Court judge had, without
any request from the jury or from counsel, provided the jury with a copy of the
evidence of
a Crown witness.  In the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL, there was no
criticism in principle of the trial judge having taken it upon himself
to make
part of the transcript available to the jury (at 308-309).  The only question
was whether fairness required that other parts
of the transcript ought also to
have been made available if that was to be done.  In the opinion of Hunt CJ at
CL a new trial was
not required.  Smart J, on the other hand, was of the
opinion that the judge had erred in allowing the transcript of portion of the
evidence to be furnished without the transcript of certain other evidence (at
324).  In his Honour's opinion, a new trial was required.
 Ireland J agreed
with the orders proposed by Hunt CJ at CL and with his reasons.  
<P>

12	It appears that, in this case, all three members of the bench were of the
opinion that the trial judge had a discretion to provide
transcript of evidence
to the jury apart altogether from the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury
Act</a>,</i> which is predicated on a request by the jury.  That accorded with the
opinion of the members of the Law Reform Commission to which
I have referred.

<P>

13	The existence of such a discretion, apart altogether from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a>, had also
been accorded some support in the judgment of Ireland J in <i>Guirguis</i> (CCA
(NSW), 11 November 1996, unreported).  His Honour said:
<P>

	"I would not go so far as to say that, absent a request from the jury, it
would not be open to a trial judge to place before a
jury part of the
transcript of evidence."
<P>

His Honour went on to refer to the possible need to supply to the jury
additional balancing transcript in the circumstances of the
case.  Gleeson CJ
said he was in substantial agreement with the reasons given by Ireland J and
did not dissent from the observation
to which I have referred.  James J agreed
with Ireland J and with the supplementary reasons of Gleeson CJ (which do not
bear on this
topic).
<P>

14	These sources relate to transcript of evidence, as does <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C.</a>  However, if
there is a discretion in a trial judge to provide a jury with transcript of
evidence dehors <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a>, as appears to be the case, there is no reason to doubt
that the discretion extends to the provision of any part of the record of
the
proceedings, insofar as the proceedings have taken place in the presence of the
jury.  It remains to consider how the discretion
should be exercised.
<P>

15	The Crown prosecutor raised no objection to the jury having a copy of his
opening address and of the opening statement by counsel
for the accused.  He
submitted that a list of Crown witnesses would be unnecessary.  Requiring the
accused to present a list of defence
witnesses would, of course, not be
entertained.  Counsel for the accused objected totally to the jury being
furnished with the materials
requested.
<P>

16	The reasons given by counsel for the accused for his position are as
follows.  First, it is said that a jury might treat the
transcript as evidence.
Secondly, it is said that the jury might, later in their deliberations, treat
the transcript as a summary
of the evidence.  Thirdly, it was said that the
opening statement on behalf of the accused identified issues rather than
specifying
the evidence which would or might be called on behalf of the
accused.  It was submitted that the accused might be prejudiced by highlighting
the fact that, at the commencement of the proceedings, the Crown had specified
the witnesses it would call, whereas the accused had
not done so.
<P>

17	In my opinion, the jury should, generally speaking, be provided with a copy
of the Crown's opening address and of the opening
statement on behalf of the
accused if these have been recorded and if that is requested by the jury or by
a juror for the following
reasons.  
<P>

18	First, what has been said in the Crown's opening address and in the
statement made on behalf of the accused has been said for
a purpose.  If the
jury or a member of the jury wishes to be reminded of what was said, that will
facilitate the purpose for which
it was said in the first place.  That is a
strong reason for making the record available if requested.  There would need
to be reasons
to the contrary which outweighed that consideration and which
could not be met by appropriate warnings against misuse of the transcript.
 In
another connection but in words which convey the present point, Everett J said
in <i>Williams</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/tas/TASRp/1982/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] TASRp 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20Tas%20R%20266" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) Tas R 266</a>,280:
<P>

	"To deny the jury the benefit of reading with their eyes the same words as
they heard with their ears seems to me to put the law
into an ill-fitting
straightjacket." 
<P>

19	Secondly, to provide a transcript of the opening address and opening
statement is to do no more than the jury are entitled to
provide for
themselves.  A member of the jury might be able to make a shorthand note or
might make a very comprehensive summary which
can be read to other jurors in
the jury room.  If there could be no objection to that - and there cannot be -
it is inconsistent
to refuse to provide the official record, at request, when
the record carries the additional quality of guaranteed accuracy.  
<P>

20	Thirdly, the enactment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a> was an expression of opinion by the
parliament that the practice in relation to the non-provision of transcript of
evidence which
existed prior to 1987 was wrong.  The Law Reform Commission gave
reasons for rejecting that practice and for the recommended reform
to end it.
In the introduction to Chapter 6 of the report, Making the Jury's Task Easier,
the Commission said (at page 71):
<P>

	"It is our view that efforts should be made to simplify the task of juries.
We reject the argument that the difficulties identified
lead necessarily to the
conclusion that juries should be abandoned.  In this chapter we recommend ways
in which, at various stages,
the task of the jury can be made easier, by which
we mean more convenient, more comfortable, simpler and fairer.  The easier this
task is made, the more effective will be the jury's performance and the more
reliable the verdict."
<P>

In support of Recommendation 49, to which I have referred the Commission said
(page 90):
<P>

	"The jury should be assisted to deliberate effectively and rationally on the
evidence presented in court.  We have recommend above
(Recommendation 38, para
6.20) that jurors should be provided with notebooks as a matter of course and
permitted to make notes during
the trial.  The provision of the transcript in
addition could compensate for any lack of reliability in the notes made and
could
save time in the jury's deliberations."
<P>

In the second reading speeches in the House and in the Assembly, it was
acknowledged that the amending bill was an implementation
of a number of the
recommendations in the report (Hansard, 48th Parliament, 3rd Session, page
16523, 19 November 1987; and page 17131,
24th November 1987).  The reasoning
which led the Commission to make Recommendation 49, and which can be taken to
have led the parliament
to enact <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a>, applies to provision of the record of
any part of the proceedings which take place before the jury and which bears on
the jury's
function.
<P>

21	Fourthly, since the enactment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s55c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55C</a>, the provision of parts of the
transcript of evidence to the jury, at their request, has become commonplace.
In that regard, a new
factor has arisen which bears on the provision of the
transcript of an address or opening statement.  If the purpose of providing
a
transcript of evidence is to remind the jury, accurately and in a complete way,
of what was said in a part of the proceedings before
them - as it is-
consistency requires that the record of other parts of the proceedings
conducted before the jury should also be
provided, at request, for the same
purpose. 
<P>

22	There is no difference in the considerations which arise if the request is
made by a member of the jury as distinct from the
jury as a whole.  Counsel for
the accused could see no distinction.
<P>

23	Lastly, I acknowledge the risk that the record of an opening address or of
an accused's opening statement might be misused. 
That is also true of the
address or statement as delivered in court when one has regard to the
possibility that a member of the jury
might have made a full note which is
subsequently used in jury room.  But it has to be acknowledged that the risk of
misuse is higher
when a formal looking, typed record is provided.  In another
connection, that kind of heightened risk has judicial recognition:
<i>Driscoll</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20137%20CLR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 137 CLR 517</a> (per Gibbs J at 542).  <i>Driscoll</i> is
not, however, authority for proscribing the supply to the jury of part of the
record of the proceedings.  
<P>

24	As I have recorded, counsel in the present case had incorporated cautions
against misuse in what they said to the jury.  These
could be reinforced and
supplemented by me.
<P>

25	Having regard to the foregoing considerations, I decided that it was
appropriate in the present case to provide the jury with
the  transcript of the
Crown's opening address and of the accused's opening statement.
