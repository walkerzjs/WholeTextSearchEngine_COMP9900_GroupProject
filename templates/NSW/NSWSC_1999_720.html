<b>55011/1999 - ELKATEB v LAWINDI &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	This is another round in a lengthy litigious bout between
the plaintiff, Dr M.S. Elkateb, the first defendant, Mr W. Lawindi,
and the
second defendant, an Arbitrator, Mr L. Austin: <b>Lawindi v Elkateb &amp;
Anor</b> and <b>Elkateb v Lawindi</b> (Giles CJCommD - 11 July 1997 -
unreported); <b>Elkateb v Lawindi</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 396</a>; <b>Elkateb v
Lawindi</b> (Giles CJCommD - 8 May 1998 - unreported); <b>Elkateb v Lawindi
&amp; Ors</b> (Hunter J - 30 October 1998 - unreported); and <b>Elkateb v
Lawindi &amp; Anor</b> (Rolfe J - 18 December 1998 - unreported). There has
been a lengthy arbitration before Mr Austin over the building dispute, which
is
central to the litigation, between Dr Elkateb and Mr Lawindi. A preliminary
conference was held on 15 January 1997, and the arbitration
continued for some
ten days during 1998.  Mr Austin delivered an Interim Award on 20 February 1999
in which he found that Dr Elkateb,
who was the proprietor, should pay Mr
Lawindi, who sued as an and on behalf of the builder, $41,888 and interest
thereon from 24
June 1996 until the date of settlement, at the rate set forth
in the building contract to which I shall refer.
<P>

2   	The amount involved is, in relative and absolute terms,
quite small, and essentially insignificant when compared with the costs
the
parties must have incurred in the litigation and arbitration.  By way of
example, on the present application I have been furnished
with six lever arch
folders of documents comprising almost 3,000 photostated pages.  These
represent the evidence in the arbitration,
submissions and various documents
used in earlier proceedings.  I do not propose to part from this matter without
observing that
it is unfortunate that the parties and their legal
representatives have been unable to find a more satisfactory way of deploying
their time and financial resources.  I say that particularly in the light of
various observations, which have been made by other
Judges in relation to some
of the applications made.  For example, in his reasons of 11 July 1997, Giles
CJCommD said, p.2:-
<P>

<b>"There was, with respect, a degree of confusion in the submissions in this
and other respects .."</b>
<P>

3   	In his reported judgment his Honour referred to the
unsatisfactory way in which the matter had been presented to the Court
and, at
p.399, observed:-
<P>

<b>"There was no attention at all given in the hearing to the pre-conditions
concerning substantial savings in costs and likelihood of
leave to appeal.
Only because, and to the extent that, the matters addressed on the hearing of
the summons went to the jurisdiction
of the arbitrator, that is, to whether it
was open to him to proceed at all or in relation to certain of the claims in
the points
of claim, should the Court be involved, and it is involved not via
s.39, not by way of intervention in the arbitration, but to settle
whether and
to what extent there is an arbitration.  As with the framing of these orders,
there was a regrettable lack of understanding
of the appropriate function of
the Court in relation to arbitrations."</b>
<P>

4   	At p.404 his Honour felt compelled to say that:-
<P>

<b>"The factual basis for this argument was somewhat confused"</b>
<P>

and 
<P>

<b>"I confess that I was and still am unable to understand the argument to the
conclusion, despite the earnestness with which it was
repeated for my
assistance."</b>
<P>

5   	In his reasons of 8 May 1998 his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"Application by notice of motion in those proceedings was inappropriate, as
they had been disposed of and the application was not
an interlocutory
application in or to do with them.  When this was raised, leave was given to
file a fresh summons returnable instanter
in which the removal of the
arbitrator was sought, and the affidavits prepared for use in the earlier
proceedings were read in the
new proceedings.  Irregularities in the form of
summons were waived, and so procedural integrity was preserved, albeit in a
slightly
damaged state."</b>
<P>

6   	In his reasons of 30 October 1998 Hunter J said, pp.1 and
2:-
<P>

<b>"That hearing has taken place and I am satisfied that there is no basis
whatsoever for the application which is based upon what is
said to be
apprehended bias as that concept is understood in <i>Livesey v New South Wales
Bar Association</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 288</a> and actual bias in the second way in
which actual bias is explained, namely, unconscious actual bias, in the cases
cited by Einstein
J in <i>Gibson v O'Keefe</i> (unreported 20 May 1998).
Mainly because I regard the application as without any merit at all, I do not
feel constrained to review
the evidence as it has been adduced through the
affidavits of the plaintiff's solicitor and the plaintiff, added to which time
constraints
of the Court are such that it is simply not possible for me to
address the matter in detail, even if it were necessary to do so,
which I
repeat I think is unnecessary."</b>
<P>

7   	His Honour concluded his reasons thus:-
<P>

<b>"In deciding against that course I think it should be emphasised that there
have been a number of applications by the plaintiff to
this Court relating to
this contract and arbitration, and, in the case of the application which is the
subject of the decision of
Justice Giles, it seems to me that, as with this
application, it was without merit and that the legal profession have an
obligation
to protect their clients from themselves.</b>
<P>

<b>In my view, forcefully advised the plaintiff should have been deterred from
making this application notwithstanding his affidavit
evidence of his belief of
the bias of the arbitrator.</b>
<P>

<b>It may be at the end of the day this arbitration will conclude and the
complaints as to matters of law which to some extent are reflected
in the
affidavit of the plaintiff may prove to be justified but it is no way to give
voice to those complaints in the manner that
the plaintiff has chosen to do so
in these proceedings."</b>
<P>

8   	The proceedings in respect of which I gave judgment on 18
December 1998 were ones whereby Dr Elkateb sought an order restraining
the
Arbitrator from re-commencing the hearing of the arbitration.  I refused to
make that order and in the course of doing so, said,
pp.3-4:-
<P>

<b>"The type of complaints to which the Summons adverts without, as I have
said, any particularisation or specificity, may, and I put
it no higher than
that, in due course, be grounds for the Court to exercise its powers under
either s.38, if there is an error of
law which falls within the stringent
requirements of that section, or under s.42.  However, what the Court is being
asked to do at
this stage, towards the end of a lengthy arbitral process, which
has been punctuated by several visits to the Court for relief, is
to seek to
put itself in the position of the Arbitrator, who has a particular knowledge of
the arbitration, and who, on any view,
must be the person best equipped at the
moment to determine how the arbitration should proceed."</b>
<P>

9   	I concluded that no ground had been made out for granting
the relief sought; that the parties should direct their attention
to concluding
the arbitration as expeditiously as possible, so that the Arbitrator could
present his Award; and that when that was
done the time would have arrived when
any application in relation to the Award, either by way of application for
leave to appeal
or to set it aside, could be considered.
<P>

10   	In due course it will be necessary for me to refer in some
detail to the way in which the legal representatives, and particularly
the
former legal representative for Dr Elkateb, Mr J. Assi, solicitor, conducted
the arbitration on the last hearing day before the
Arbitrator.  It is clear
that the Arbitrator was not given any real assistance by Mr Assi in resolving,
in an orderly way, how the
arbitration should be concluded.
<P>

11   	I have referred to these matters in order that the reader
may have some background knowledge of what has transpired, which
may indicate,
in part, the reasons for the difficulties in the litigious and arbitral
process, which have occurred thus far.  I also
consider that it is very
important to bear in mind that in arbitral proceedings before a lay arbitrator,
in the sense of an arbitrator
with particular knowledge of the subject matter
of the dispute but not of all legal aspects involved, there is, in my opinion,
an
obligation on legal representatives to give the arbitrator all proper
assistance, consistently with the duty to the client, to ensure
that the
arbitration does not fail on technical legal grounds.
<P>

<b>The Dispute</b>
<P>

12   	On 23 April 1995 a Building Contract was entered into, in
a form produced by the Master Builders' Association of New South
Wales.  There
is no dispute that Dr Elkateb was the proprietor.  There is a dispute as to the
identity of the builder.  The back
sheet of the agreement described the builder
as "Lotus Constructions .. represented by Wasfy Lawindi".  The operative part
of the
agreement identified the builder as "Lotus Constructions Wasfy Lawindi
(trading as Lotus Constructions) of 24 Rickard Street Guildford
2161 NSW".
<P>

13   	It was not in issue that the agreement was signed by Mr
Lawindi, nor, as I understand it, that at all material times he and
Mr George
Hadidi carried on business in partnership under the name of Lotus
Constructions.
<P>

14   	The building work involved the erection of ten new home
units at Bankstown and, so far as the evidence discloses, that work
was carried
out.  A dispute arose between Dr Elkateb and "the builder", the latter claiming
$142,141 in respect of carrying out the
works and variation works; damages; a
reasonable sum in respect of carrying out the works; and a declaration as to
whether $6,689
was paid by the "builder" to Dr Elkateb under a mistake of fact.
Dr Elkateb asserted an entitlement to liquidated damages for delay
in the sum
of $62,500 and damages.
<P>

15   	The agreement contained an arbitration clause, which
provided, inter alia:-
<P>

<b>"25(a)	In case any dispute or difference shall arise between the Proprietor
and the Builder, either during the progress of the Works
or after the
determination, abandonment or breach of the Contract, as to the construction of
the Contract or as to any matter or
thing of whatsoever nature arising
thereunder or in connection therewith, then either party shall give to the
other notice in writing
of the dispute or difference and at the expiration of
seven days, unless it shall have been otherwise settled, the dispute or
difference
shall be and is hereby submitted to the arbitration of an Arbitrator
who shall be (at the option of the party who first shall serve
the Notice of
Dispute) either the President of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects,
NSW Chapter, or his nominee, or the
President of the Master Builders'
Association of NSW or his nominee provided that the Arbitrator shall be a
graded member of the
Institute of Arbitrators, Australia."</b>
<P>

16   	The jurisdiction thus conferred is, relevantly for present
purposes, in the case of any dispute or difference between "the
Proprietor",
who undoubtedly was Dr Elkateb, and "the Builder", the identity of whom was in
dispute.  Put another way, Dr Elkateb
had not agreed to confer upon an
arbitrator jurisdiction to hear a dispute between him and any person or entity
other than "the Builder".
 It was, essentially, this jurisdictional question to
which Giles CJCommD was referring in his reported judgment.
<P>

17   	Clause 29 provided definitions and, relevantly for present
purposes, "Builder" was defined as:-
<P>

<b>"The Builder or any person acting by his authority and on his
behalf."</b>
<P>

18   	On 2 April 1995 Mr Lawindi and Mr George Hadidi signed a
document headed "Partners Agreement", which stated:-
<P>

<b>"This is to certify that either partners of the registered business `lotus
constructions' (BRN4419645) is able to act as an agent
for the businesses
abovementioned.  The agent's tasks shall include signing of building contracts
&amp; public relations with clients
&amp; Statutory Authorities.</b>
<P>

<b>I There For give my consent to the above condition."</b>
<P>

19   	It seems to me that a fair reading of this document leads
to the conclusion that either Mr Lawindi or Mr Hadidi was authorised
to act as
the agent for the partnership in respect of its business, thereby confirming
the prima facie position to which their relationship
as partners would give
rise.  Whilst certain of the agent's tasks are nominated, that is not stated as
being an exclusive prescription
of them, and, in my opinion, acting for the
business of Lotus Constructions would also involve the enforcement of any
building contract
into which the agent had entered.  Accordingly, as between Mr
Lawindi and Mr Hadidi, Mr Lawindi had authority to enter into the contract
on
behalf of the partnership and to take steps necessary to enforce it.
<P>

20   	The agreement between Dr Elkateb and "the Builder"
included an agreement between him and "any person acting by his" (the
Builder's)
"authority and on his behalf".
<P>

21   	Therefore, when one returns to clause 25(a), any dispute
or difference is one in respect of which the Arbitrator has jurisdiction
if it
is between Mr Elkateb and "any person acting by" (the Builder's) "authority and
on his behalf".  The Partners' Agreement was
in evidence before the Arbitrator
and I am satisfied that both the partnership relationship and it allowed Mr
Lawindi to enter into
the building contract and to enforce it through the
arbitral process on behalf of the partnership.
<P>

22   	On 4 December 1996 a Notice of Dispute was furnished to Dr
Elkateb, which named Mr Lawindi and Mr Hadidi trading as Lotus
Constructions as
the Builder.  It was signed by Mr Lawindi:-
<P>

<b>".. for himself and on behalf of George Hadidi pursuant to an Authority
dated 2nd April 1995".</b>
<P>

This was a clear recognition that the Notice of Dispute was given by Mr Lawindi
on behalf of himself and Mr Hadidi.
<P>

23   	Dr Elkateb wished to assert that the partnership was the
Builder for at least two reasons.  Firstly, because the partnership
did not
hold a building licence pursuant to the <b>Building Services Corporation
Act</b> 1989, so that it could not recover for the work done.  Secondly,
because he asserted that he had entered into an agreement with Mr
Hadidi, which
had compromised the proceedings.
<P>

24   	In his reported judgment Giles CJCommD considered
declarations sought by Dr Elkateb that Mr Lawindi had no standing to bring
the
arbitration proceedings, and that the Building Agreement was unenforceable by
Mr Lawindi.   Dr Elkateb also sought orders that
the Points of Claim filed by
Mr Lawindi be struck out and that the arbitration proceedings commenced by him
be dismissed.  His Honour
considered the position under the <b>Building
Services Corporation Act</b> and, at p.407, said:-
<P>

<b>"Taking together all these considerations, I prefer the view that submission
of disputes to arbitration pursuant to an arbitration
clause is not enforcing a
remedy within the meaning of s.10 ...   In my view, Mr Lawindi was not
precluded by s.10 from invoking
the arbitration clause and submitting to
arbitration the disputes in claims (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f)."</b>
<P>

25   	In <b>O'Connor v LEAW Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20285" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 285</a>,
I held that a claim by an unlicensed contractor based on quantum meruit is not
a remedy "in respect of a breach of the contract"
and thus was not prohibited
by s.10(1)(a) of the Act, and that a reference to arbitration is not a remedy
or the enforcement of a
remedy in respect of a breach of contract, which
s.10(1)(a) prohibits.
<P>

26   	It may be that in view of these two decisions Dr Elkateb
has not pursued his claim that the Arbitrator could not determine
the matter if
the Builder was the partnership and if the partnership was not licensed.
Whatever the reason that claim has not been
pressed, although the claim in
respect of the alleged compromise with Mr Hadidi has been.
<P>

<b>The Parties To The Contract</b>
<P>

27   	In his reported decision Giles CJCommD said, at p.405:-
<P>

<b>"The factual findings which might be necessary, given one of the grounds in
the Points of Defence taking up s.4 and s.10 of the Building
Services
Corporation Act, will fall to the Arbitrator if the Arbitrator is not
precluded, and in the circumstances I think it best
if I expressly hold back
from any factual or other findings in connection with the contracting parties
and licences.</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>For reasons to which I now come, even assuming that the contract was entered
into in contravention of s.4, I do not think that s.10
precluded Mr Lawindi
from invoking the arbitration clause or submitting the disputes (less claim
(e)) to arbitration.  That being
so, the proper forum for considering the
effect of s.10 on the substantive claims is the arbitration."</b>
<P>

28   	In his Interim Award the Arbitrator considered who were
the parties to the contract in the following terms:-
<P>

<b>"THE PROPER PARTIES TO THE CONTRACT</b>
<P>

<b>The Claimant has submitted that the parties could have contracted in one of
three possible ways.</b>
<P>

<b>a)	The Claimant (Lawindi) as builder and the Respondent (Elkateb) as
proprietor.</b>
<P>

<b>b)	Lawindi for himself and as agent for an undisclosed Principal, namely,
the Partnership of Lotus Constructions and Elkateb as proprietor.</b>
<P>

<b>c)	Lotus Constructions as builder and Elkateb as proprietor.</b>
<P>

<b>The Respondent has submitted that the parties could have contracted in one
of a further two possible ways.</b>
<P>

<b>d)	Lotus Constructions and Tony Hadidi (as builders) and the
Respondent.</b>
<P>

<b>e)	Wasfy Lawindi and Tony Hadidi (as builders) and the Respondent.</b>
<P>

<b>The contract is ambiguous.  It refers to Lotus Constructions Wasfy Lawindi
(trading as Lotus Constructions).  This implies that both
Lawindi and Lotus
Constructions are parties and that Lawindi is Lotus Constructions.  However the
cover sheet implies that Lawindi
was acting as an agent for Lotus
Constructions.  In view of the ambiguity I have looked at the events leading up
to the signing of
the contract to determine who are the parties.  This evidence
is as follows:</b>
<P>

<b>1	Lotus Constructions is a partnership between Wasfy Lawindi and George
Hadidi.  I accept the evidence of an affidavit sworn by Wasfy
Lawindi on 6th
June 1997 which reads in part `<i>The agreement (the building contract dated
23rd April 1995) was signed by myself and on behalf of George Hadidi.  Prior to
signing
the agreement George Hadidi had signed a document dated 2 April
1995</i>'.</b>
<P>

<b>2	The document dated 2nd April 1995 reads in part `<i>This is to certify
that either partners of the registered business "lotus construction" (brn
4419645) is able to act as an agent for
the businesses above mentioned.</i>"
It is signed by George Hadidi and Wasfy Lawindi as partners.</b>
<P>

<b>3	The pre-contract negotiation was between Lawindi and Elkateb.  Tony Hadidi
was also involved but I am satisfied that Tony Hadidi
is not a party to the
contract because at all times he was described as the building supervisor.  On
pages 605, 606 the Repondent
said <i>`Tony Hadidi in the preliminary meeting
that we had was to look at the drawings and make some kind of assessment to
what prices are
by negotiating with my architect and structural engineer and
nothing else ....</i>'</b>
<P>

<b>	`<i>This came later on when they submitted a tender and they have Tony
Hadidi's name noted as a supervisor ...</i>'</b>
<P>

<b>4	The tender was on a Lotus Constructions letterhead and signed by Lawindi
with Tony Hadidi's name noted as supervisor and his licence
number.</b>
<P>

<b>5	All documents were signed by Lawindi.</b>
<P>

<b>6	The Respondents admitted that all correspondence between himself and Lotus
was with Lawindi.</b>
<P>

<b>In all the above circumstances I find that the contracting parties were
Lawindi as builder and agent for Lotus Constructions (a partnership
between
Lawindi and George Hadidi)."</b>
<P>

29   	Whilst, at least at one stage, Mr Lawindi sought to argue
that the partnership was not a party to the Building Contract, that
is a
submission which, in my view, cannot be sustained and, Mr L. Foster of Senior
Counsel, who appeared at the conclusion of the
hearing for Mr Lawindi, did not
seek to maintain that that was the true position.  He conceded that the finding
was that the contracting
parties were Mr Lawindi acting on his own behalf and
as agent for the partnership, his entitlement to act in the latter capacity
flowing from the document dated 2 April 1995, and the fact that he was acting
in that capacity coming from his concession referred
to in paragraph 1 of the
Arbitrator's Reasons.  However, Mr Foster submitted that this finding did not
deprive the Arbitrator of
jurisdiction because, in bringing and prosecuting the
arbitration, Mr Lawindi was acting as agent for the Builder which, by dint
of
the definition of "Builder", included Mr Lawindi acting on behalf of the
Builder.  Therefore, so Mr Foster submitted, it was established
that as between
Mr Lawindi and Mr Hadidi, Mr Lawindi was entitled to act on behalf of the
partnership, and that as between Dr Elkateb
and the partnership, Mr Lawindi, as
the agent of the partnership, it being the Builder, was entitled to bring the
arbitration.
<P>

30   	In those circumstances it was not, ultimately, in issue
that the contract was entered into between Dr Elkateb, as the Proprietor,
and
the partnership, as the Builder.  This may leave for other litigation any
dispute between Mr Lawindi and Mr Hadidi as to their
respective rights as
partners, but that was not a matter which could be resolved in the arbitration,
and it is not a dispute which
concerns Dr Elkateb once it is established, as in
my view it is, that the arbitral proceedings were brought properly against
him.
<P>

31   	A question was raised as to whether the matters to which I
have referred gave the Arbitrator jurisdiction to hear the matter,
or whether
it was necessary for Mr Hadidi to be joined as a party to the arbitration.  It
seems to me clear that as Mr Hadidi had
authorised Mr Lawindi to bring the
arbitration proceedings, and as Mr Lawindi and Dr Elkateb had agreed that the
Builder, for the
purposes of the Building Agreement, meant a duly appointed
agent of the Builder, that Mr Lawindi was entitled to bring the proceedings.
There was, accordingly, in my opinion, no absence of necessary parties.
<P>

32   	I think it is convenient to conclude this portion of the
matter by referring to the submissions made before me on behalf of
Dr Elkateb
and the extent to which they went.  The submissions were that the issue was
whether the partnership was the contracting
party.  They continued to seek to
establish that and referred to the various material which, in my opinion, does
establish that point.
<P>

33   	In paragraphs 9 and 10 it was written:-
<P>

<b>"9.	Thereafter however, Lawindi by his Points of Claim (p.1864) alleged,
wrongly that he was the sole contracting party.  The Arbitrator,
at p.12,
appears to have permitted Lawindi to proceed in the arbitration in his own name
only because he was a contracting party
in his own name and was agent for the
partnership named in the Notice of Dispute.</b>
<P>

<b>  10.	The Arbitrator had, however, no jurisdiction to uphold such a claim in
the name of Lawindi in his own right when the dispute
notice was in the name of
Lawindi and Hadidi, as the joint contracting parties."</b>
<P>

34   	In my opinion the jurisdictional question must be answered
adversely to Dr Elkateb, for the reasons I have given.
<P>

35   	On the question of jurisdiction it is necessary to note
that the Arbitrator had regard to Mr Lawindi's Amended Points of Claim
in
which, in paragraph 1A, it was pleaded:-
<P>

<b>"In the alternative, on 23 April 1995 the Applicant entered into an
agreement with the Respondent for and on behalf of himself and
as agent for
Lotus Constructions, a partnership then constituted between the Applicant and
George Hadidi."</b>
<P>

The Arbitrator continued, p.12:-
<P>

<b>"As Lawindi was a contracting party in his own right and also as an agent
for Lotus Constructions he had authority to commence the
arbitration and to
issue the Notice of Dispute.</b>
<P>

<b>I find that I have jurisdiction."</b>
<P>

36   	In my opinion, for the reasons I have sought to give, this
was correct.
<P>

37   	The argument put forward by Dr Elkateb was that as there
was no jurisdiction the Award has no legal effect.  In my view this
submission
must be rejected.
<P>

38   	Various submissions were put as to whether Mr Lawindi was
acting as agent for an undisclosed principal.  Even if he was, about
which I
have some doubt, it does not seem to me that this affects the analysis of the
contracting parties I have undertaken.
<P>

<b>The Present Proceedings</b>
<P>

39   	By an Amended Summons filed on 28 May 1999 Dr Elkateb
sought orders pursuant to s.38(4) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/caa219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act</a></b>
1984, ("the Act"), that the plaintiff be granted leave to appeal against the
Interim Award in respect of various questions of law,
and that pursuant to s.42
of the Act the Interim Award be set aside wholly.  He also sought an order
pursuant to s.44 of the Act
that the Arbitrator be removed and, alternatively,
an order pursuant to s.43 that the questions or issues set out in Schedule 3 be
remitted to him.
<P>

40   	Mr Lawindi filed a Summons on 1 April 1999 seeking leave
to cross-appeal.  His complaint was that the Arbitrator was in error
in failing
to find that Dr Elkatab repudiated the Building Agreement, and by failing to
make a finding that the Builder was entitled
to extensions of time for carrying
out variations to the works, thereby further extending the date for practical
completion beyond
22 April 1996.
<P>

<b>A Consideration Of The Questions Of Law</b>
<P>

41   	The questions of law raised by Dr Elkateb are articulated
in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the Amended Summons. In order to
be granted
leave to appeal Dr Elkateb, relevantly for immediate purposes, must establish
that there is a manifest error of law on
the face of the Interim Award and
that, having regard to all the circumstances, the determination of that
question could substantially
affect the rights of one or more parties to the
arbitration agreement.   The necessity for the question to be one of law has
been
made abundantly clear by the decisions in <b>Promenade Investments Pty
Limited v State of New South Wales</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2026%20NSWLR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 26 NSWLR 203</a> and <b>Natoli v
Walker</b> (Court of Appeal - unreported - 26 May 1994).  Questions of the
proper exercise of discretion also arise.
<P>

42   	Paragraphs 3(a) to (g) are concerned with the question of
parties.  For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that Mr Lawindi
was
entitled to bring the arbitration.  However a further point was raised, namely
whether Mr Lawindi "as sole claimant", could maintain
the proceedings either
without issuing a Notice of Dispute in his own name, or in circumstances where
the Notice of Dispute was issued
in the name of the partnership.  Another
question was stated to be whether the Notice of Dispute is at law defective
since it was
not authorised by the partnership, and whether the arbitration
clause can be invoked where there is no dispute between the partnership
and the
plaintiff.
<P>

43   	I do not think I can usefully add to what I have written
on this point.  The Arbitrator did not find that Mr Lawindi was the
"sole"
claimant.  He found that he and the partnership were the claimants and the
Notice of Dispute was executed by Mr Lawindi both
for himself and on behalf of
the partnership on any fair reading of it.  I am satisfied that  Mr Lawindi had
the necessary authority
to bring the arbitration proceedings.
<P>

44   	Paragraphs 3(h) and (i) state:-
<P>

<b>"(h)	Whether the release of the plaintiff by George Hadidi bound the first
defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	Whether the settlement between George Hadidi (acting on behalf of
Lotus Constructions) and the plaintiff extinguished the first
defendant's cause
of action."</b>
<P>

45   	In submissions Dr Elkateb did not seek to pursue these
matters.  I can understand the reason for this and, as the matter was
not
pursued, I could content myself by passing over it.  However, I think it
necessary, at least in fairness to the Arbitrator, to
observe that he dealt
with the matter at pp.12-13 of the Interim Award.  He found that an agreement
entered into between Mr George
Hadidi and Dr Elkateb on 21 June 1996 was not an
agreement binding on Mr Lawindi as he was not a party to it.  In these
circumstances
the only way Mr Lawindi could have been bound was if it was one
made on behalf of the partnership and, therefore, was binding on
him.  
<P>

46   	The Arbitrator made detailed findings of fact.  It was not
suggested that the agreement of 2 April 1995 authorised the entry
into the
alleged compromise agreement.  Indeed, on the Arbitrator's findings of fact
that could not have been suggested because,
by 8 June 1996, Mr George Hadidi
was stating that any correspondence from Lotus Constructions should be signed
by both Mr Lawindi
and himself.  The Arbitrator referred to a letter from Mr
Hadidi seeking a meeting with Dr Elkateb "to discuss, reconcile and finish
this
matter in a satisfactory manner between yourself and us (George and Tony
Hadidi)".  The meeting was held on 21 June 1996 and,
on 26 June 1996, minutes
were signed as the Settlement Agreement.  However, from the findings of fact
made by the Arbitrator that
was a meeting to conclude the matter as between Dr
Elkateb, on the one hand, and Mr George Hadidi and his son, Mr Tony Hadidi, who
was not a party to the partnership, on the other.  It was not suggested that it
was in any way to conclude matters between the partnership.
 The Arbitrator
held:-
<P>

<b>"I find that the agreement is not binding on the partnership, Lotus
Constructions.  Section 5 of the partnership Act provides that
one party may
bind a partnership `unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to
act for the firm in the particular matter
and the person with whom a partner is
dealing .. knows that the partner has no authority ..'.  In this matter I am
satisfied that
George Hadidi had no authority from Lawindi and the respondent
knew this."</b>
<P>

In my opinion the finding was either one of fact or of mixed fact and law.
<P>

47   	I have dealt with this issue, although it was not the
subject of submissions, because it seems to me that the Arbitrator is
entitled
to the Court's noting the care with which he dealt with it and because, in any
event, even if the matter had been pursued,
I do not consider it is one where
Dr Elkateb could establish the prerequisites to obtaining leave to appeal.
There is also the question
of the proper exercise of discretion, which is
relevant in considering the grant of leave.  I have referred to the amount
involved.
 As Mahoney JA pointed out in <b>Natoli v Walker</b> the Court
retains a discretion as to whether to grant leave and, in exercising that
discretion, it may have regard, inter alia, to
the amount in issue as such, or
to that amount compared to the costs involved.  Even if this point had been
pursued by Dr Elkateb
and I had been of the view that it was one upon which he
was otherwise entitled to succeed, I would have entertained serious doubt
whether leave should be granted having regard to the amount involved.   
<P>

48   	Paragraph 3(j) posed as a question of law:-
<P>

<b>"Whether the Arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine whether a $24,000
payment from the first defendant to the plaintiff was a loan
or a refund for
certain variations wrongly claimed; and whether the first defendant was
estopped from re-claiming the refund."</b>
<P>

49   	This was a matter with which the Arbitrator dealt at
length, pp.13-14, and which was not the subject of any submissions. 
As it
involves questions of jurisdiction and estoppel I do not see that it is
possible for the Court to further consider it in the
absence of any
submissions. It seems to me, in any event, that the matter was one of fact as
dealt with by the Arbitrator and, further,
having regard to the amount involved
of some $2,971.78, the exercise of discretion would justify refusal of leave to
appeal.
<P>

50   	Paragraph 3(k) posed:-
<P>

<b>"Whether the date of commencement of the building works by the first
defendant is at law NOT the actual date of commencement of the
works BUT some
other date made possible <u>FOR</u> commencement by the contract."  (The
emphasis is added by the pleader.)</b>
<P>

51   	The written submissions of Dr Elkateb stated that Mr
Lawindi had asserted that he commenced work in April 1995, whereafter
work
progressed satisfactorily without any dispute.  Under clause 5 of the contract
the date for practical completion was to be 165
days from "the date of
commencement", which was not defined.  Further, by clause 5, the Builder was to
commence work within fourteen
days from the date of down payment.  Dr Elkateb
submitted this was a separate obligation "as to when the Builder must commence,
but
otherwise the date of commencement is the date that the Builder actually
does commence the work".  He further submitted that the
Arbitrator erred in
construing the contract to deem the date of commencement to be fourteen days
after down payment, rather than
the date of actual commencement.
<P>

52   	In order to consider granting leave to appeal on this
point there must either be a manifest error of law on the face of the
Interim
Award, or strong evidence that the Arbitrator made an error of law and that the
determination of the question may add, or
may be likely to add, substantially
to the certainty of commercial law.
<P>

53   	It seems, from Dr Elkateb's submissions, that it is the
latter provision upon which he relied, it being stated that the contract
is a
standard form one and its interpretation on this "key clause will be of
significance in the industry".
<P>

54   	The Arbitrator noted clause 5, which is beside the words
"Date for Practical Completion".  The clause is in the following
terms:-
<P>

<b>"5.	The Builder shall commence the works within fourteen days from receipt
of down payment and shall diligently proceed with the works
and bring them to
practical completion within 165 working days from the date of
commencement."</b>
<P>

The Arbitrator posed the question as to when the work commenced, which he
answered by stating that under the terms of the contract
it was to commence
within fourteen days from the date of down payment, which occurred on 18 May
1995.  He construed "days" as meaning
"working days" and stated that the date
for commencement was therefore 7 June 1995.  No complaint is made about the
construction
that "working days" was the relevant yardstick.
<P>

55   	Dr Elkateb's submission was that the Arbitrator should
have taken, as the starting point, the date when the work "actually"
commenced.
<P>

56   	I disagree with this submission.  Clause 5 is not solely
concerned with the date of commencement, but the date for practical
completion,
the significance of that date being that liquidated damages may run from it.
The commencement contemplated in clause
5 is that defined in the opening words
of the clause and it is, in my opinion, only from the application of that
formula that the
starting period for the 165 working days is to be calculated.
The fact that the builder entered upon the work prior to receiving
the down
payment simply means that he was carrying out work at his own risk and for his
own reasons, but clause 5 does not provide
in terms, or upon a proper
construction, that the commencement shall be "the date of actual
commencement".
<P>

57   	In my opinion the Arbitrator's construction was correct
and, certainly, there is no strong evidence that he made an error
of law.  Nor
is there any evidence that the determination of the question may or may be
likely to add "substantially" to the certainty
of commercial law.
<P>

58   	Nextly, it was submitted that the Arbitrator erred in
allowing fifteen days for "Christmas shut down" because the contract
only
refers to week-ends, public holidays and rostered days off as being days not to
be taken into account for the purpose of calculating
days.  The Interim Award,
at p.41, referred to "Christmas shut down plus public holidays 15 days".
Clause 5 provides for "working
days".  Prima facie the fifteen days were not
"working days" or, whether they were or were not was a question of fact. 
<P>

59   	It was nextly submitted that by reason of a slip or
miscalculation of figures, the Arbitrator miscalculated the number of
working
days between 7 June 1995 to 22 April 1996, which he ought to have corrected,
pursuant to s.30, but declined to do so because
he misconstrued the import of
the section.
<P>

60   	By letter dated 2 March 1999 the former solicitors for Dr
Elkateb wrote to the Arbitrator setting out certain alleged errors
and, in
relation to this point, suggesting that the proper calculation was 195 days for
the reasons set out in the letter.  By letter
dated 11 March 1999 the
solicitors for Mr Lawindi responded thus:-
<P>

<b>"The respondent is again seeking to review the evidence tendered during the
course of the hearing.  The respondent appears to be challenging
the evidence,
notwithstanding that the Interim Award has been published.  The respondent is
clearly not entitled to review the evidence
in this way.  Even if the
respondent's belated calculations are correct (and we do not concede that they
are), the applicant would
nonetheless be entitled to extensions of time for
completion of the work over and above allowance for week-ends, wet days, public
holidays and RDO's on account of variations to the works which have been
allowed.</b>
<P>

<b>It is then suggested that the period within which the works were required to
achieve practical completion is to be determined by reference
to a date
commencing from when the applicant was given access to the site.  It is then
suggested that the evidence of the parties
in this way raises some question of
law.  Clearly it does not.  The date of commencement is to be determined by
reference to the
Contract itself."</b>
<P>

61   	On 15 March 1999 the Arbitrator responded:-
<P>

<b>"I can only alter the Award if the `slip' rule applies and my opinion is
that it does not in this case.  I cannot consider new evidence
and the matters
you have raised now should have been raised earlier.  The times and dates for
completion of the work should have
been questioned during cross-examination of
Mr O'Mara and reimbursement for the carpets was not in the cross-claim."</b>
<P>

62   	It is clear from the letter of 2 March 1999 that Dr
Elkateb accepted that the calculations were based on Mr O'Mara's figures.
 That
was the evidence the Arbitrator accepted and he was not prepared to consider
new evidence.  It seems to me that for the reasons
set out in his letter it
could not be said that the Interim Award contained a mistake or error of the
type to which s.30 refers.
 The matter was one of substance, which the
Arbitrator decided on the evidence before him, and, as he pointed out, any
other evidence
should have been raised at the hearing and, if contrary evidence
was available, it should have been placed before him.
<P>

63   	The matter to which I have just referred is dealt with in
paragraph 3(m), the question asked being whether the Arbitrator
misapplied
s.30.  In my opinion, on the material placed before me, it has not been shown
that he did.
<P>

64   	The final issue raised, as a mistake of law, was:-
<P>

<b>"(l)	Whether the plaintiff was entitled to claim compensation for the loss
of the sale value of the units."</b>
<P>

Dr Elkateb submitted that evidence was led that four of the ten units were sold
by him at an under value of between $10,000 and
$15,000 per unit due to their
being sold with unremedied defects, and that no evidence was led in reply.
<P>

65   	At p.41 of the Interim Award the Arbitrator said:-
<P>

<b>"The respondent has submitted that each unit dropped $10,000 in value
because of the defects and the poor quality of finish.  </b>
<P>

<b>I accept the evidence of the claimant that claiming loss of value <i>and</i>
rectification of defects is double dipping."</b>
<P>

In those circumstances he did not allow compensation for loss of value.
<P>

66   	It was submitted by Dr Elkateb that this mistook the true
position at law when the property had been sold.  His submission
was:-
<P>

<b>"Where the defects have impacted on the sale price the proprietor's loss
will be the impact of the defects on the sale price <u>rather than</u> the cost
of rectification.  Hence, no `double dipping' is involved."</b>
<P>

67   	In my opinion there is no question of law involved.  The
Arbitrator's point was quite simple.  It was that if Dr Elkateb chose
to sell
the units in the defective condition, and thereby took a lesser price, he may
have been entitled to damages based on that
lesser price, but he could not
recover those damages and also claim in the arbitration damages for the cost of
rectifying the units,
which he had already sold.  Put another way, it would
have been open to Dr Elkateb to carry out the repairs and, accordingly,
mitigate
his damages and sell the units for the best price possible. Further
there is an implicit, and, in my opinion, impermissible assumption,
in Dr
Elkateb's submission, viz that Mr Lawindi was contractually responsible for
such defects as existed.  In so far as he was,
he was compensated, the
Arbitrator making it clear that there could not be a claim for loss of value
and defects. The Arbitrator's
conclusions in this regard do not involve a
manifest error of law nor, in my opinion, any such error.  
<P>

68   	In my view the Amended Summons, in so far as it deals with
asserted errors of law, must be dismissed.
<P>

<b>Alleged Misconduct</b>
<P>

69   	In Schedule 2 to the Amended Summons the question is posed
as to whether the Interim Award should be set aside by reason of
the
Arbitrator's alleged misconduct, or his alleged misconduct of the arbitration.
It is alleged that he misconducted himself or
the proceedings in that:-
<P>

<b>"1.	He has mishandled the questions and issues referred to in Schedule 3 to
this Summons.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	He has awarded amounts for variations on an incorrect basis.  For
example, in Variation 1B &amp; C he calculated the original
cost of the
excavation with reference to the quote of the builder obtained from the
sub-contractor and not the quote the builder
gave to the proprietor.</b>
<P>

<b>  3.	Denying the Plaintiff natural justice.  The Arbitrator cut the
proceedings short and denied the Plaintiff the opportunity to
cross-examine the
First Defendant's key witnesses whose testimony the Arbitrator subsequently
accepted.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.	On the face of the award, he failed to consider all of the evidence.
The Arbitrator neglected to consider important evidence
tendered in the
proceedings on behalf of the Plaintiff with respect big-item defects.  On the
face of the award it appears he does
not know the existence if (sic) this
evidence."</b>
<P>

70   	Section 42 of the Act provides:-
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	there has been misconduct on the part of an arbitrator .. or an
arbitrator .. has misconducted the proceedings; </b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>the court may, on the application of a party to the arbitration agreement,
set the award aside either wholly or in part."</b>
<P>

Section 44 provides:-
<P>

<b>"Where the Court is satisfied that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	there has been misconduct of an arbitrator ... or an arbitrator ... has
misconducted the proceedings</b>
<P>

<b>...................................</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may, on the application of a party to the arbitration agreement,
remove the arbitrator ..."</b>
<P>

71   	Kirby P, in considering "misconduct" in relation to s.44,
pointed out that it referred to "misconduct" "of a technical kind":
<b>Commonwealth of Australia v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20662" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36
NSWLR 662</a> at p.673.  His Honour said that "misconduct" may fall far short of
the understanding of that term "in the popular sense of the word"
and "may
involve no personal turpitude on the part of the arbitrator".  He considered it
may "amount to little more than a mishandling
of the arbitration likely to
occasion an injustice".
<P>

72   	In my opinion any allegation of such misconduct must be
considered in the context of the arbitration as a whole and the way
in which
the parties conducted it: <b>State of New South Wales v Coya (Constructions)
Pty Limited</b> (Rolfe J - 4 July 1994 - unreported).  I also consider that
"misconduct" has the same meaning in s.42 as in s.44 and, also, it must
be
noted that the granting of the remedy in both sections is discretionary.
<P>

73   	The matters referred to in Schedule 3 include in
paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 matters with which I have already dealt as
asserted errors of law with, perhaps, the possible exception of 9.  As I have
come to the conclusion that the Arbitrator dealt with
these matters properly
there is no basis for concluding that he misconducted himself.
<P>

74   	Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and probably 9 raise questions of the
sufficiency of reasons.  No written submissions were furnished in
relation to
the alleged insufficiency of reasons and, in those circumstances, I do not
propose to examine the matter further, save
to say that, in my opinion, it
would require a very compelling case to show that an arbitral award did not set
forth sufficient reasons
such as to constitute misconduct, as opposed to a
relevant error of law.
<P>

75   	The second matter raised was a matter squarely for the
determination of the Arbitrator and, even assuming for the moment,
that the
Arbitrator proceeded on an incorrect basis, error, in itself, does not amount
to misconduct.  The type of error alleged
is in relation to matters of fact and
for the Court to intervene it would be necessary to show that the error was of
an egregious
kind in circumstances where it was not open to the Arbitrator to
make the finding, before it could be characterised as misconduct.
<P>

76   	On the question of denial of natural justice it is
necessary to bear in mind a number of matters.  Firstly, s.14 of the Act
provides that the Arbitrator may conduct proceedings under the agreement in
such manner as he thinks fit.  Obviously the Arbitrator
is obliged to ensure
that the parties are afforded natural justice in all its various
manifestations. , and whilst s.14 confers very
wide powers, they are not
limitless: <b>Cockatoo Dockyard</b>.
<P>

77   	Secondly, it is necessary to note how the arbitration had
proceeded.  There had been extensive pleadings articulating the
various issues,
a preliminary conference on 15 January 1997 and a lengthy hearing over the
period to which I have referred, during
which the main witnesses were
cross-examined at length.  The Arbitrator had viewed the site twice and raised
matters for the parties'
consideration with their experts.
<P>

78   	Thirdly, the Arbitrator was confronted with a position of
some difficulty.  After recounting what had transpired at the arbitration,
on
pp.3 and 4 of the Interim Award, he continued:-
<P>

<b>"On the eighth hearing day, 2nd November, the respondent was unable to
attend.  His solicitor produced a doctor's certificate for
severe anxiety
depression and sought an adjournment for two weeks.  By telephone conference
with the Respondent's doctor and psychiatrist
it was determined that the
Respondent's condition could be short term, a matter of hours, and the hearing
was adjourned until 4th
November.</b>
<P>

<b>On the 3rd November the Respondent was admitted to hospital and a further
adjournment was sought.  The relevant doctor, Dr Burn, was
cross-examined on
4th November and an adjournment was granted, the length of the adjournment to
be subject to an update on the Respondent's
condition.</b>
<P>

<b>Following a further medical certificate that due to the Respondent's mental
condition he would be unable to attend a hearing for four
months I called a
preliminary hearing on 24th November and invited the parties to submit ways in
which the arbitration could be finalised
without the Respondent being
present.</b>
<P>

<b>The Claimant proposed that we proceed on documents and statements only with
the appropriate weight being given to these documents
and statements.</b>
<P>

<b>I directed that the week starting 7th December be set aside for a hearing
either with or without the Respondent being present.  The
only condition under
which I would grant a further adjournment was the Claimant be given permission
to examine the Respondent with
his own psychiatrist.  This permission was not
granted.</b>
<P>

<b>At the hearing on 7th December Counsel for the Respondent sought an
adjournment on the grounds that the Respondent had suffered further
medical
problems, this time being a blood clot that had resulted in him being admitted
into intensive care.  I accepted Counsel's
claim but refused the
adjournment.</b>
<P>

<b><u>After considering the delays to date, the uncertainty of the Respondent's
medical condition and the extent of the cross-examination
already heard I
determined that the arbitration would be concluded on the evidence tendered
plus those statements and documents yet
to be tendered with the appropriate
weight placed on those statements and documents</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>During the hearing some matters were concluded on the understanding that
they would be dealt with further when appropriate witnesses
were brought in for
cross-examination.  These were the formworker, the plumber, the painter and
occupants of the units.  I have taken
this into consideration and asked the
Parties to provide further information in relation to plumbing matters.</b>
<P>

<b>I directed the Parties forward their final submissions by 14th December 1998
but following an application from the Respondent I extended
this time to 11th
January 1999."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

79   	There are a number of matters to be noted from what the
Arbitrator wrote.  Firstly, he granted an adjournment initially. 
Secondly,
there being no resolution to the problem, he convened a further preliminary
hearing on 24 November 1998.  Thirdly, although
setting the matter down for
further hearing to commence on 7 December 1998, he left open the possibility of
granting a further adjournment,
if Dr Elkateb was suffering from a psychiatric
disorder, provided Mr Lawindi's representatives were given permission to
examine Dr
Elkateb, which permission was not granted.
<P>

80   	Fourthly, on 7 December 1998 an adjournment was sought
because of a different medical condition.  At this point the matter
had been
adjourned since 2 November 1998 and the question as to whether a further
adjournment should be granted was one peculiarly
within the Arbitrator's
discretion. 
<P>

81   	Fifthly, the Arbitrator had to have regard to how he would
conclude the arbitration and, in a paragraph I have quoted, he
set out the
matters to which he gave consideration.  I have emphasised what appears to be
the critical passage, in which he disclosed
his reasons.  In my opinion, these
were proper matters for the Arbitrator to take into account in deciding whether
to grant a further
adjournment, and I am not satisfied that, having taken them
into account, the Arbitrator's discretion miscarried.  He also had to
have
regard to the position of Mr Lawindi.  I shall refer shortly to the way in
which Mr Assi put the matter to the Arbitrator on
7 December 1998 against the
background of which the Arbitrator came to his conclusion. Finally, the
Arbitrator subsequently extended
the time to those representing Dr Elkateb to
furnish their written submissions, and there is no suggestion that any
application was
made to him for leave to re-open the evidence or to further
cross-examine.
<P>

82   	It was submitted by Dr Elkateb that on 7 December 1998 the
Arbitrator, having declined his application to adjourn the proceedings
notwithstanding that he was in hospital, over-ruled Mr Assi's objections to his
receiving into evidence various documents and proceeding
with submissions.  It
was submitted that this approach "unjustly prejudiced and surprised the
plaintiff in four broad ways", namely:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	The plaintiff was denied a fair opportunity to reply to new material
tendered by the defendant on that day;</b>
<P>

<b>  (b)	The plaintiff was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the
witnesses whose statements the arbitrator was to rely upon;</b>
<P>

<b>  (c)	The plaintiff was prejudiced by having the new material received
irrespective of its form when previously the rules of evidence
had been applied
to the plaintiff's evidence; and</b>
<P>

<b>  (d)	The rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i>."</b>
<P>

83   	Each of these propositions was expanded upon.  It was
submitted that Dr Elkateb was entitled to a fair hearing and a fair
opportunity
to present his case, including the right to respond by evidence in reply "to
evidence being led and with submissions".
 The submissions then traced through
the various statements.  It was submitted that it was reasonable for Dr Elkateb
to assume that
he would be given an opportunity to respond to all of the new
material, once Mr Lawindi had clearly decided to rely upon it; that
Dr Elkateb
was taken by surprise at the arbitration's being aborted, as it was described
in the submissions; and that the plaintiff
ought to have been given the
opportunity to reply before the Arbitrator closed the evidence.  Alternatively,
it was submitted, the
Arbitrator should have adjourned the hearing, or at least
proceeded in the absence of the plaintiff for the three days allocated
from 7
December 1998.  In my opinion, these submissions must be considered against the
background of the following:-
<P>

(a)	the Arbitrator had stated that he would only grant an adjournment on 7
December 1998 on specific terms;
<P>

(b)	although Dr Elkateb was suffering from a different illness on that day, no
prior notice had been given to either the Arbitrator
or Mr Nicholls that he
would not be available;
<P>

(c)	Mr Assi chose to conduct the matter on 7 December 1998 on the basis that if
an adjournment was refused, he would proceed with
the application for an
injunction; and
<P>

(d)	the consequence of (c) was that Mr Assi had not put in place any plans for
continuing the arbitration if the application was
refused, (it not being
seriously open to doubt that it would be opposed), and, therefore, made no
constructive suggestion as to how
the alleged prejudice to Dr Elkateb could be
overcome.
<P>

84   	In general terms the submissions made on behalf of Dr
Elkateb set out the prima facie way in which arbitral proceedings are
to be
conducted.  However, every situation has to be judged in the context of a given
arbitration.  In the context of this arbitration,
which had been on foot for
many months, in which much evidence and cross-examination thereon had already
been heard by the Arbitrator,
and in which a lengthy adjournment had been
granted to accommodate Dr Elkateb's position, the Arbitrator was faced with the
dilemma
of concluding the arbitration or adjourning it with no guarantee as to
when it may resume or whether, when it did, Dr Elkateb would
be available.  He
was obliged to take into account not only the position of Dr Elkateb, but also
that of Mr Lawindi.  I do not consider
that in having regard to the matters to
which he did, and in the particular circumstances of this arbitration, his
discretion miscarried.
 Nor do I consider that it caused any injustice.
Certainly I am not satisfied that it miscarried in a way which amounted to
misconduct.
 I am fortified in this view by the failure by Dr Elkateb to seek
to re-open the arbitration thereafter, or to produce any statements
in reply
for the Arbitrator's consideration, or to take any other steps, save for
furnishing submissions.  These submissions neither
raised any complaints about
what the Arbitrator had done, nor pointed to any areas in which Dr Elkateb was
prejudiced by the Arbitrator's
conduct.
<P>

85   	The next series of submissions deals with the denial of
the right to challenge the new material by cross-examination.  It
was submitted
that two witnesses, Mr Lawindi and Mr O'Mara, who had already been
cross-examined, were still to be cross-examined
further in respect of certain
variations.  However, there was no application made to the Arbitrator on 7
December 1998 to further
cross-examine Mr Lawindi and Mr O'Mara in the time
remaining.  In these circumstances the submission that the Arbitrator
misconducted
himself by preferring their evidence, where there was said to be
no relevant cross-examination, over that of Dr Elkateb, who had
been
cross-examined, is not made out.  Mr Lawindi and Mr O'Mara had been
cross-examined at length, and I shall refer to Mr Assi's
final submissions as
to how the Arbitrator should treat their evidence.
<P>

86   	It was submitted that Mr Assi was not offered the
opportunity to cross-examine Mr Lawindi's witnesses or lead further evidence
in
the absence of the plaintiff who was in hospital.  It was conceded that was
previously suggested by the Arbitrator as an option,
but, as I have just said,
it was not a matter taken up by Mr Assi on 7 December 1998.
<P>

87   	As Mr Assi had already had the opportunity of
cross-examining relevant witnesses the complaint now made that "serious issues
of fact and credit .. were intended to be raised by the plaintiff in
cross-examination of the defendant and his witnesses" lacks
real force.  It
disappears when Mr Assi's submissions as to their credibility are
considered.
<P>

88   	I think it is now necessary to look with some care at the
transcript of what transpired on 7 December 1998.  After the application
for an
adjournment was made the Arbitrator asked Mr Assi whether he had any witnesses
arranged for "to-day": Tp.106.  This was a
completely reasonable question from
the Arbitrator, who, in my opinion, was entitled to assume that Mr Assi would
have approached
the hearing on the basis that if the adjournment application
was refused, he would be in a position to proceed.  It was for that
purpose
that three hearing days had been set aside.  There was then a dispute between
the Arbitrator and Mr Assi as to whether the
matter was to proceed without Dr
Elkateb being present and, after some disputatious discussion between the legal
representatives,
Mr Assi said:-
<P>

<b>"I have not come here to-day with further evidence."</b>
<P>

Mr Assi offered no explanation as to why he had adopted that course and,
thereafter the matter degenerated and, if I may say so
with respect to the
legal representatives before the Arbitrator, it did so because they chose to
engage in a disputatious harangue
between themselves rather than seeking to
provide any assistance to the Arbitrator as to what should be done to complete
the arbitration.
<P>

89   	At Tp.110 the Arbitrator asked whether there was a problem
if he took the balance of the evidence without cross-examination.
 Mr Assi said
there was, and that he believed that both parties ought to have the opportunity
to cross-examine properly.
<P>

90   	Thereafter, Mr Nicholls requested the Arbitrator to
receive the written submissions and, at Tp.112, he said:-
<P>

<b>"Most of the hearing so far as variations are concerned, proper parties to
the contract, has been concluded.  You've heard cross-examination
in relation
to that.  All of those matters are set out in my written submissions.  I don't
propose to say anything more about it."</b>
<P>

91   	Mr Assi then said that it was proposed to seek an
injunction from this Court, which was the injunction I refused to grant.
<P>

92   	Certain statements were tendered and, in response to an
invitation from the Arbitrator, Mr Nicholls commenced to address.
 The totally
unacceptable situation, which had developed before the Arbitrator, manifested
itself at Tp.123:-
<P>

<b>"MR ASSI: Mr Nicholls, would you let me complete my submissions. </b>
<P>

<b>MR NICHOLLS: It is not a submission in the sense ..</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: You are an absolute disgrace to the Bar and to the legal
profession.</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: Mr Assi, just speak to it.</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: This fellow wants to rush through awards.</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: Mr Assi, just come on.</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: Wants to trample on all forms of legal procedure and natural
justice.  You are an absolute disgrace.</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: Mr Assi, just ..</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: Again I'm saying this for the record, Mr Arbitrator, that the way
Mr Nicholls has conducted himself to-day is an absolute
disgrace and yet again
he is showing that by this ridiculous submission he is trying to rush matters
as quickly as possible by having
concurrent submissions.</b>
<P>

<b>For the record I state the proper course of events is that the applicant
completes his submissions and we'll reply to them and then,
if he wants to
reply to ours, he is welcome to do so. But all of this is subject to a summons
we are going to put in the Supreme
Court."</b>
<P>

93   	This passage of transcript, as I have indicated, gave no
assistance to the Arbitrator and, if I may say so, appears to have
fallen far
short of the conduct of responsible legal representatives engaged in arbitral
proceedings.  However, the concluding portion
is significant.  Mr Assi there
asserted what he considered the proper course to be, although subject to the
application for an injunction.
<P>

94   	The way in which the matter concluded, particularly so far
as Mr Assi was concerned, did not assist matters.  I quote from
Tpp.124-125:-
<P>

<b>"THE ARBITRATOR: Mr Assi, I would like your statement by Friday, your
submissions.  I would like you to still exchange them.  <u>If you see that
they've introduced something into it that hasn't been brought up in here, you
can make a note of it and inform me
of that</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: This is getting more ridiculous by the minute, Mr
Arbitrator.</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: That's the way ..</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: Have we finished for the day?</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: Good.</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: Have you got any more?</b>
<P>

<b>MR NICHOLLS: If Mr Assi wants to leave he can leave.  But, no, if Mr Assi is
asking - who are you asking that question to?</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: I am asking to the Arbitrator have we finished for the day?</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: Is there anything else you want to ..</b>
<P>

<b>MR NICHOLLS: Mr Arbitrator, I would like to tender a statutory declaration
from have you got a copy for Mr Assi.</b>
<P>

<b>....</b>
<P>

<b>MR ASSI: Mr Arbitrator, the farcical nature of these proceedings is yet
again exposed.  We have further declarations and statements
being handed up.
My client hasn't even seen them, for obvious reasons, and you're asked to make
an award without my client having
the benefit of reading these further
statements.  He is handing statements even after submissions.  I have got
nothing further to
say, Mr Arbitrator.</b>
<P>

<b>THE ARBITRATOR: OK.  We will finish.  Thank you very much."   (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

95   	The passage I have quoted makes clear that the Arbitrator
was leaving it open to Mr Assi to draw to his attention any new
material.  As I
read Mr Assi's final submission no such matter was referred to.  The passage is
also important because it showed
that the Arbitrator was not concluding the
hearing in a pre-emptory or unfair way.  He expressly provided Mr Assi with the
opportunity
to raise the existence of new material, which, in the event, was
not done.  The only reasonable inference is that there was none,
or, if there
was, Mr Assi had no instructions or reason to raise it with the Arbitrator or
seek to challenge it.
<P>

96   	I have quoted from the transcript at some length because
it demonstrates that Mr Assi made no real attempt to provide a constructive
regime within which to deal with the matters about which complaint is now made.
Rather, as I read the transcript, having advised
the Arbitrator that an
application would be made to this Court for an injunction, Mr Assi chose to do
nothing more than seek to conclude
the day's proceedings.  There was ample
opportunity for him to put forward constructive suggestions as to how the time
remaining
on the rest of that day and on the following two days might be
utilised to overcome any problems and to consider, in a constructive
way, how
such material as was before the Arbitrator could be answered. As I have said,
the Arbitrator invited submissions on new
material. There was ample opportunity
for submissions to be made as to the need to cross-examine and to seek to
arrange to have witnesses
available for cross-examination.  However, Mr Assi,
in essence, invited the Arbitrator to terminate the day's proceedings so that
the injunction proceedings could go ahead.
<P>

97   	In all these circumstances it seems to me that complaints
about the failure to be allowed to cross-examine, the receipt of
hearsay
evidence and the failure to adhere to the rule in <b>Browne v Dunn</b> must be
rejected. On 7 December 1998 there was no request for a short adjournment to
consider the further material upon which Mr
Lawindi sought to rely, nor, so far
as I am aware, was the Arbitrator referred to any hearsay evidence or any
breach of the rule
in <b>Browne v Dunn</b> or to the way in which that rule
applied in the present case.
<P>

98   	The submissions on behalf of Dr Elkateb, which were sent
to the Arbitrator under cover of a letter of 11 January 1998, commence
at
p.2548 of the bundle.  They deal with the proper parties to the contract;
jurisdiction; value of variations/defects; settlement
of all disputes; matters
relating to credibility of witnesses; and variations.  These were the matters
in issue.
<P>

99   	On the question of Mr Lawindi's cross-examination it was
written:-
<P>

<b>"There is no need to burden the Arbitrator with every detail of Lawindi's
evidence which points to his complete lack of credibility.
 It is sufficient to
highlight the following .."</b>
<P>

Various matters were then set forth.  Mr Assi was asserting that Mr Lawindi
should not be believed.  I must assume that this was
a submission responsibly
made.  In the circumstances complaints that further cross-examination was
needed can scarcely be taken seriously.
<P>

100   	In relation to Mr O'Mara it was written:-
<P>

<b>"No weight can be put to O'Mara's evidence as he admitted to merely
utilising figures supplied to him by Lawindi.  This is dealt with
in more
detail in Annexure D to these submissions."</b>
<P>

I make the same observation about the complaint that Mr O'Mara was not
available for further cross-examination.
<P>

101   	My reading of the submissions discloses nothing raising
any of the issues upon which Dr Elkateb now places such reliance,
namely denial
of the right to challenge the new material, (which would, in the light of what
the Arbitrator had said, not be tenable),
receipt of hearsay evidence and the
breach of the rule in <b>Browne v Dunn</b>.  Rather the submissions deal with
the matters on their merits and, so far as credibility is concerned, make a
forceful challenge
to that of Mr Lawindi and Mr O'Mara.
<P>

102   	The material before me completely fails to satisfy me
that the Arbitrator was in any way guilty of misconduct.  Even if it
could have
been argued that on 7 December 1998 the Arbitrator should have afforded Mr Assi
some short adjournment to enable him to
respond to the position with which he
was presented in a constructive manner, the right to make that submission has,
in my opinion,
been lost by the way Mr Assi chose to proceed.  The transcript
is clear that he was prepared to rest upon the fate of the application
for an
injunction to the Supreme Court and, in my opinion, effectively waived his
client's other rights.  Therefore, even if I had
come to the view that there
had been any misconduct on the part of the Arbitrator I would not, in the
exercise of my discretion,
had made an order pursuant to either s.42 or
s.44.
<P>

<b>Mr Lawindi's Application For Leave to Cross-Appeal</b>
<P>

103   	By his Summons seeking leave to cross-appeal Mr Lawindi
asserted that the Arbitrator was in error, as a matter of law, in
failing to
find that Dr Elkateb repudiated the Building Agreement by purporting to serve a
notice of intention to terminate it on
20 February 1996, and by purporting to
terminate it by a notice dated 14 May 1996, notwithstanding that the Arbitrator
found that
the date for practical completion was 22 April 1996.
<P>

104   	It was further asserted that the Arbitrator erred in law
in failing to make any finding that Mr Lawindi was entitled to extensions
of
time for the carrying out of variations to the works, thereby further extending
the date for practical completion beyond 22 April
1996.
<P>

105   	The Summons stated that a finding that Dr Elkateb
repudiated the Building Agreement would have entitled Mr Lawindi to recover
the
cost of carrying out the works on a quantum meruit basis, and that the value of
so doing on that basis was $1,204,403.03 compared
to the contract price of
$783,500.
<P>

106   	The Summons continued:-
<P>

<b>"7.	The Arbitrator has found that the date for practical completion of the
building works was 21 April 1996 allowing extensions of
time for Christmas shut
down, rostered days off and public holidays.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	The chronology set forth in the Award refers to a Notice of Intention
to Terminate the Agreement dated 20 February 1996 and a
letter terminating the
Agreement dated 14 May 1996.</b>
<P>

<b>  9.	The respondent was not entitled to issue a Notice of Intention to
terminate the building agreement on 20 February 1996 and wrongfully
purported
to terminate the building agreement by the letter dated 14 May 1996.</b>
<P>

<b>  10.	It must follow that the issuing of the Notice of Intention to
Terminate and the letter terminating the Agreement constituted
a repudiation by
the respondent of the building agreement, which repudiation was accepted by the
applicant vacating the site of the
works."</b>
<P>

107   	The Summons asserted that the determination of the
questions of law raised issues concerning the repudiation of a standard
form of
building contract in circumstances where a proprietor wrongfully exercised a
contractual right to terminate, and that Mr
Lawindi contended that the
following matters ought to be remitted to the Arbitrator for reconsideration
and determination:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	Extensions of time to which the applicant is entitled following upon
the carrying out of variations to the works.</b>
<P>

<b>  (b)	The amount the applicant is entitled to be paid for the carrying out
of the building works valued on a quantum meruit basis."</b>
<P>

108   	The written submissions for Mr Lawindi, which were not
elaborated upon in oral addresses, were that the Arbitrator found
that the date
for practical completion was 22 April 1996.  It was then submitted that Dr
Elkateb purported to terminate the building
contract based on his assertion
that Mr Lawindi was required to achieve practical completion by February 1996,
but that the Arbitrator
failed to hold that Dr Elkateb repudiated the
agreement, thus entitling Mr Lawindi to recover on a quantum meruit basis,
which would
have substantially increased his claim.  It was also submitted that
in determining the date for practical completion the Arbitrator
only extended
it by reference to wet weather, week-ends, public holidays and rostered days
off.  No extension was given, although
claimed, in respect of additional time
taken in carrying out the variation works, the Arbitrator not needing to deal
with the extensions
of time because time was extended to 22 April 1996 in any
event.
<P>

109   	The attack made by Mr Lawindi is based on the assertion
that the Arbitrator should have found that Dr Elkateb repudiated
the Building
Agreement rather than finding, as he did, p.2 of the Interim Award, that Dr
Elkateb "terminated the agreement by notice
in writing dated 14th May 1996 and
the claimant left the site".  It also necessary to note that the Arbitrator
found that the work
was completed on 22 April 1996.  In these circumstances it
seems to me that the further claim propounded by Mr Lawindi cannot be
supported, because the alleged termination of the Building Agreement occurred
after the work was completed and, accordingly, the
completion of the work
occurred pursuant to the terms of the contract.
<P>

110   	In my opinion the attacks sought to be mounted by Mr
Lawindi are challenges to factual findings and do not give rise to any
error of
law and, accordingly, the Summons for leave to cross-appeal should be
dismissed.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

111   	The conclusions to which I have come require the
dismissal of both Summonses.  By far the greater part of the time was taken
up
with Dr Elkateb's Summons.  I think that this is an appropriate case to
apportion the costs having regard to the knowledge of
it and to the time taken
on the various issues.  In my opinion, that is accommodated properly by
providing that Dr Elkateb should
pay seven eighths of Mr Lawindi's costs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

112   	I order that:-
<P>

(a)	Dr Elkateb's Summons be dismissed.
<P>

(b)	Mr Lawindi's Summons be dismissed.
<P>

(c)	Dr Elkateb pay seven eighths of Mr Lawindi's costs of Dr Elkateb's Summons,
otherwise no order as to costs.
<P>

(d)	Exhibits be returned.
