TUESDAY 27 APRIL 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. JEFFREY WILLIAM NOYES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	The accused, Jeffrey William Noyes, was indicted before me on a single count
that on or about 16 November 1997 at Seven Hills
in the State of New South
Wales he murdered his mother Shirley Adelaide Noyes.
<P>

2	An election was made on the advice of his legal representatives for trial by
Judge alone, which election was accepted by the Director
of Public
Prosecutions.  I was advised by his counsel, Mr. Austin, and by the Crown
Prosecutor that no question of any unfitness
for trial or to plead presently
existed.
<P>

3	When the trial was called on, the accused pleaded not guilty before me.  Mr.
Austin, who appears for the accused, advised me that
the only matter that arose
at the trial for decision was as to a defence of mental illness and that no
contest was made on the part
of the defence with the propositions that the
accused caused his mother's death with the requisite intent so that the offence
of
murder would have been committed except for the mental illness defence.
<P>

4	Mr. Austin explained that the plea of not guilty was to be understood as
putting that matter only in issue.  Thereafter, the accused
made all necessary
admissions as to the other necessary matters and made them pursuant to s.184 of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.
<P>

5	The Crown tendered in evidence a statement of facts cross-referenced to
various statements provided to the police prior to committal.
 Those statements
were also tendered.  Those statements included various statements made by the
accused at the time at which he was
apprehended at his mother's home and made
subsequently to the police.  Those statements were relied on by both the
prosecution and
the defence, both of which urged me to receive them and to act
on them.
<P>

6	Both the prosecution and the defence contended that those statements
amounted, not only to admissions that the accused had with
intent to kill,
killed his mother in the very way in which the post mortem certificate of the
forensic pathologist indicated she
had been injured, but also indicated that at
the time his mental state was so deranged that he was, by reason of mental
illness,
unable to appreciate the nature and quality of his act or,
alternatively, that his act was wrong.  The statements would at common
law have
been admissible to prove both the fact of what had occurred and the fact of
mental illness.
<P>

7	In short form, at about half past four in the morning on 16 November 1997 the
accused telephoned 000 and requested an ambulance
and a priest attend his
mother's home.  On the arrival of the police and the ambulance, the accused,
who was then wearing green and
gold football shorts and other clothing, was
seen to be splattered with blood.
<P>

8	The accused spoke to Constable Lind, asserted matters from which it appeared
he was suffering from religious mania, including
his believing that his mother
needed to be killed, requesting an exorcism, and that the police should not
enter the premises until
after a priest had been obtained. 
<P>

9	The body of the deceased, upon examination in the premises, had been injured
in a way which indicated that whoever had inflicted
the injuries upon her was
severely deranged.  On the body a small plaque of stained glass had been
placed.  There was evidence that
the deceased died from a battering to her head
and from the infliction of other bizarre injuries which it is not necessary
that I
detail.
<P>

10	The accused admitted to the police that he had killed his mother.  He had
asserted that he needed to do that because of his views,
of a delusional
nature, relating to his mother, her relationships, and the imminence of her
giving birth to a child.  He linked his
activities to his wearing the green and
gold shorts, which he described as emblematic of Australia.  He claimed he had
done a service
to the world and put paid to the prospective birth of a demon.
At one stage it appeared as though he might have become conscious
of the nature
of what he had done and sought that he be afforded the opportunity to be able
to contact his sister in the Nepean Hospital
so that "Mum could be put back
together again". 
<P>

11	Numerous statements have been provided by the Crown of the accused's prior
mental condition and aggressive and vicious behaviour
over many years.  No
contest has been made as to even the detail of those statements. I accept what
is contained in them as powerful
evidence to show how grossly the accused's
behaviour had become disturbed and how appalling in consequence was his conduct
towards
the members of his family, and in particular his mother.
<P>

12	As the Crown submits, the picture which emerges from the statements is of a
very disturbed man who was delusional and aggressive,
particularly towards his
mother, and that that delusional and aggressive state escalated manifesting
itself in peculiar aggressive
behaviour in the weeks prior to his mother's
death.  During that time in particular the behaviour took on a religious
dimension,
which explained the concerns he had and the manner of the death, to
an extent.
<P>

13	The accused plainly had suffered from prior bouts of insanity, if not a
continued and chronic condition, as was evidenced on
his admission to
Cumberland Hospital on 13 January 1996, to Bungarribee House at Blacktown
Hospital on 19 January 1996, the finding
of the magistrate of mental illness on
25 January 1996, and the admission of 6 May 1997 to Bungarribee House. 
<P>

14	In addition, he had suffered a closed head injury in a motor bike accident
occasioning his admission to the Westmead Hospital
on 13 June 1993.  I do not
detail to any greater extent the observations made by his family members of him
or the material contained
in the hospital files and discharge summaries since
the question of whether at the time the accused was suffering from mental
illness
has been investigated thoroughly by Dr. Bruce Westmore, whose report,
Exhibit 1, of 19 May 1998 has been provided to me, and subsequently
most
extensively by Dr. Robert Lewin on behalf of the Director of Public
Prosecutions, whose report of 2 October 1998 comprises part
of Exhibit A.
<P>

15	Dr. Westmore examines the background of the accused and in particular his
assertions at the interview he had with the doctor
on 16 May 1998.  He notes
that there was a recent history of delusions referred to in the prison hospital
medical notes. 
<P>

16	He concludes:-
<P>

	"The history indicates that your client was severely mentally ill at the time
this incident occurred. The attack on his mother
which resulted in her death
was driven by delusional beliefs. There is a religious flavour to his
delusions, as well as beliefs regarding
the devil and cults. The banging of the
mother's window appears to have particular significance for him, he believed
people had been
entering the mother's bedroom and possibly have sexual
relationships with her. He talks about his mother becoming fatter, his belief
that she might be pregnant and that she might deliver the devil's child. The
nature of the offence appears to have some relevance
to these belief systems.

<P>

	Your client was mentally ill at the time this incident occurred, he has the
defence of mental illness available to him. He is suffering
a disease of the
mind, specifically paranoid schizophrenia. The illness would have totally
deprived him of his capacities at the
time the offence occurred. He requires
ongoing psychiatric support and supervision and will need this to be in place
for some time
to come."
<P>

17	Dr. Lewin examined in detail the medical notes and reports both in the
Corrections Health Service medical file and from the various
hospitals to which
the accused had previously been admitted.  He had already read the coroner's
report and the police statement of
facts, together with much of the material
contained in the statements by members of the family concerning the accused's
prior conduct.
 He was aware of the physical consequences of the motor bike
accident.  He had the advantage of Dr. Westmore's report and himself
was able
to have the advantage of interviewing the accused.  He refers to the delusional
beliefs and hallucinations of a bizarre
kind suffered by the accused, which
were consistent with the written records and the physical evidence recorded by
the anatomical
pathologist.
<P>

18	He considered the background history of Mr. Noyes and his past psychiatric
history, which it seemed again was consistent with
the diagnosis to which he
eventually came. He concluded:-
<P>

	"At the time of the death of his mother, Mr. Noyes was clearly suffering from
a psychotic illness.  That illness had its origins
in a genetic predisposition
but it is very likely indeed that this condition was worsened to a very marked
degree by his abuse of
marijuana.  On clinical grounds I suspect that he was
using amphetamine much more heavily than he acknowledged.  These drugs of abuse
are known to worsen the severity and intensity of a paranoid psychotic
illness."
<P>

19	Dr. Lewin went on to discuss the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and
expressed the view that Mr. Noyes had a mental illness
at the time of the death
of his mother, harbouring a range of delusional beliefs over a prolonged period
of time.  His report regarding
those delusional beliefs was consistent with and
reiterated the data Dr. Lewin had gained from other sources.
<P>

20	He was of the opinion that at the time of the death of his victim Mr. Noyes
was labouring under a defect of reason which he attributed
to Mr. Noyes'
delusional ideas regarding the devil.  These delusional ideas were, in Dr.
Lewin's opinion, part of a paranoid schizophrenic
illness.  Dr. Lewin was of
the view that at the time the act occurred Mr. Noyes did not know that what he
was doing was wrong.
<P>

21	Having regard to the whole of the material, I conclude that it has been
established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused
had attacked his mother
with intent to kill her, occasioning her death;  that at the time that he did
so he was suffering from the
conditions that the unchallenged, unanimous views
of the psychiatrists, supported by the whole of the evidence, consider was then
afflicting him.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt therefore of all the
matters that, except for the defence, would constitute
the offence, but I am
satisfied to the requisite extent that at the time of the acts causing death
the accused was suffering from
mental illness so as not to be responsible
according to law for his actions, that is to say, he was labouring under such a
defect
of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality
of the act he was doing, or if he did know it that he did
not know that what he
was doing was wrong.
<P>

22	I am thus satisfied of the matters which would require the special verdict
required by s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure)
Act 1990, that is,
that the accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness be reached and I
return it.  In doing so I have regard
to the consequences of that verdict.
<P>

23	The relevant tests that I have applied in this regard are set out in my
judgment in <b>The Queen v. Gillett</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/115.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 115.</a> They also appear in
the decision of Hidden, J. in <b>Regina v. Maxwell</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSW%20SC%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSW SC 281</a> and
that of <b>Regina v. Gavranovic </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSW%20SC%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSW SC 205</a>, a decision of Newman
J.
<P>

24	I am required by the legislation to have regard to those matters when
reaching my verdict. I have done so, and indeed they are
referred to in the
judgment of <b>Gavranovic</b> (supra) to which I have referred. 
<P>

25	As is required by the legislation, I make the order required by s.39 of the
Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, that
is that Mr. Noyes be detained
in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due
process of law.
<P>

26	Jeffrey William Noyes, I order that you be detained in strict custody at the
A Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital and thereafter
in such place as is
determined according to law until you are released by due process of law. 
<P>

27	I am finally obliged to explain to you and to the public generally the legal
and practical consequences of the findings and the
verdict that I have just
delivered. Mr. Noyes will not return to the community but will be detained in
strict custody in a place
which one may assume will be a psychiatric hospital
gazetted under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Act 1990</a>.  While detained in strict custody in
that way he will come under the supervision of a body known as the Mental
Health Review Tribunal.
 It comprises a president or deputy president who has
qualifications as a barrister or solicitor, and two other members, one of whom
must be a psychiatrist, and the other of whom must be a person having suitable
qualifications and experience to serve on that body.

<P>

28	Within 14 days after the verdict the tribunal will commence a review of Mr.
Noyes' case.  At the conclusion of the review it
may make a recommendation to
the Minister for Health.  The recommendation could be either unconditional or
subject to conditions
as to the manner in which he should be detained
thereafter and treated.
<P>

29	If the tribunal was satisfied, but only if it was satisfied, that neither
his safety nor that of any member of the public would
be seriously endangered
by his release, it could make a recommendation for his release.  If it makes
such a recommendation that would
be considered by the Department of Health,
which in turn would advise the Governor.  The Governor, in accordance with the
recommendation
and advice, could either make an order for the detention or for
release, conditional or unconditional.  The Governor could only make
an order
for release where the tribunal itself had recommended release.
<P>

30	After that first hearing of the tribunal it can at any later time, and must
at least once every six months, review the case.
<P>

31	After hearing evidence at a later review it would make a recommendation to
the Minister for Health as to the continued detention,
care or treatment or as
to release, conditional or unconditional.  The tribunal would not be free at
any such review to make a recommendation
for release unless it is satisfied
that his safety or that of any member of the public would not be seriously
endangered by release.
 Again, following such a review or recommendation the
matter would go to the Department of Health and the Minister would advise the
Governor.  Any recommendation so advised will only be carried into effect by
order of the Governor.
<P>

32	If Mr. Noyes was at any time released back into the public on conditions and
it appeared that a breach of those conditions took
place, then the Governor may
order that he be apprehended and detained.  Such an order would follow by
reason of the practical consideration
that if a person is released the
Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case with the assistance
of a Community Health
Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other
public facilities available.  In other words, if a person is released
conditionally
back into the community the Department would maintain a watch
over him and a breach of any conditions would lead to him being apprehended
and
detained once again.
<P>

33	The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a
particular place, taking particular medication and
so on, to ensure that he was
properly cared for and members of the public were protected.  Other than
pursuant to any such release,
Mr. Noyes will remain, as I have said previously,
in strict custody in one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic
patients. 
<P>

34	The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the
purposes of these provisions is when he is unconditionally
released by the
Governor, or is released upon conditions which include a condition as to the
time that his release should become
unconditional.  If that time expires, then
his release becomes unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic patient.
However, as
I have previously explained, Mr. Noyes or a forensic patient in his
position could never be released unless the Mental Health Tribunal,
comprising
those persons with special qualifications, be satisfied on the evidence
available to it that his safety and the safety
of any member of the public
would not be seriously endangered.
<P>

35	In this case therefore it will be a matter for the tribunal as to whether
Mr. Noyes should be at liberty at any time during the
remainder of his life and
the conditions, if any, upon which he should be admitted
<P>
