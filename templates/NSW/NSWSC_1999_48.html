JUDGMENT: 
<P>

- 20 -
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i>De Facto Relationships Act
</i>1984. 
<P>

2	By statement of claim filed on 3 June 1996 the plaintiff, Lynette Nancy
Taylor, seeks orders against the defendant, Peter George
Webster, adjusting the
interests of the parties in property. The substantive relief sought by the
plaintiff is the payment to her
by the defendant of the sum of $100,000.
<P>

3	The parties lived in a de facto relationship from July 1988 until 9 August
1995. The plaintiff (who is presently aged forty-nine)
had previously been
married and had three children. No children were born to the relationship of
the parties. However, one of the
plaintiff's children, Peter, lived with them
throughout the entirety of the relationship. Although the evidence is silent as
to Peter's
age, I gather (especially from the evidence relating to the
acquisition by him of a motor car) that towards the end of his mother's
relationship with the defendant Peter would have been aged no more than twenty.

<P>

4	The defendant (who was born on 29 August 1957 and is presently aged
forty-one) also had previously been married. However, none
of his four children
resided with him and the plaintiff during the relationship, although it would
appear that all those children
were dependent upon him throughout that period.

<P>

5	For about four years before the commencement of the de facto relationship the
defendant had been in occupation of a rural property
known as Mount Wheogo,
situate at Deaths Lane, Piney Range, near Grenfell in New South Wales. In May
1988, shortly before the commencement
of his relationship with the plaintiff,
the defendant had acquired that property by purchase from a company controlled
by his father.

<P>

6	The purchase price of Mount Wheogo was $387,078.80. That purchase was funded
in the following way. The vendor company owed to
the defendant the sum of
$189,041, and a subsidiary of the vendor company owed to the defendant
$48,037.80. The defendant, the vendor
company and its subsidiary agreed that
the vendor company and its subsidiary would be discharged from the foregoing
indebtedness,
upon the transfer of Mount Wheogo to the defendant and the
payment by the defendant to the vendor company of the sum of $150,000
(Exhibit
5). 
<P>

7	The foregoing sum of $150,000 was advanced to the defendant by his father,
that advance being secured by a mortgage over the property
(Exhibit 4).
<P>

8	The defendant's father, upon his death (which occurred during the course of
the de facto relationship between the plaintiff and
the defendant), by his
will, forgave the debt of $150,000 owing to him by the defendant.
<P>

9	It will be appreciated that the consequence of the foregoing financial
arrangements between the defendant, his father, the vendor
company (which was
controlled by the defendant's father) and a subsidiary of that company was that
it was not necessary for the defendant
himself to provide any money for the
purchase of Mount Wheogo. That fact, however, does not in any way enhance the
claim of the plaintiff
in the present proceedings. 
<P>

10	Upon Mount Wheogo the defendant throughout the period of his occupancy
conducted a farming enterprise (concentrating upon the
breeding of cattle), and
also an engineering business, known as Supreme Engineering. (I note that the
defendant in his witness statement
of 28 February 1998 gave his occupation as
"engineer", whilst in his oral evidence he said that he was a "fitter and
turner by trade".)
<P>

11	Throughout the period of the relationship the parties resided in the
homestead on Mount Wheogo. 
<P>

12	It is that property and the farming and other activities thereon conducted
(firstly, by the defendant, and, subsequently, during
their relationship, by
the plaintiff and the defendant) that have been the subject of the present
proceedings.
<P>

13	At the commencement of the relationship the assets of the plaintiff
consisted of:
<P>

	(a)	an entitlement to moneys from her previous husband, 	by way of property
settlement
<P>

	(b) 	two interest bearing deposits, totalling about $4,000
<P>

	(c) 	livestock (28 cows, 1 bull)
<P>

	(d) 	truck
<P>

	(e) 	caravan
<P>

	(f) 	furniture
<P>

14	The assets of the defendant at the commencement of the relationship
consisted of:
<P>

	(a) 	rural property, Mount Wheogo
<P>

	(b) 	cattle and a horse (to which the defendant ascribed a 	total value of
$57,650)
<P>

	(c) 	farm plant and equipment (to which the defendant 	ascribed a value of
$55,000)
<P>

	(d) 	two motor vehicles (one being unregistered), having 	a total value of
about $3,000
<P>

	(e) 	plant and equipment of Supreme Engineering (to 	which the defendant
ascribed a value of $150,000)
<P>

	(f) 	caravan
<P>

	(g) 	bank accounts (totalling about $4,930)
<P>

15	The cattle belonging to the defendant which were upon Mount Wheogo at the
commencement of the relationship had been purchased
by him from his father's
company.
<P>

16	There was placed in evidence an affidavit of David John Andrew Faulkner, a
registered valuer, sworn 1 May 1998, to which was
annexed his valuation of
Mount Wheogo at the following dates: 10 February 1998, 1 August 1995 and 30
June 1988. Mr. Faulkner's valuation
of the property at those foregoing dates
was, respectively, $255,300, $186,400, $320,950. 
<P>

17	At the outset of the hearing it was noted that the parties agreed that that
valuation by Mr. Faulkner was an accurate valuation.
<P>

18	Although the plaintiff in her statement of claim asserted that one of her
assets at the commencement of the relationship (being
an asset which she
asserted she had contributed to the relationship of the parties) was the sum of
$18,690.22 received by her by
way of a Family Law property settlement in
respect of her previous marriage, it appeared from her bank statement annexed
to her witness
statement dated 29 October 1997 that the plaintiff received that
sum only in September 1990 (a deposit in that amount being recorded
on 14
September 1990) --- that being more than two years after the commencement of
her de facto relationship with the defendant.
<P>

19	In about August 1995 the plaintiff's caravan was sold for $500 and she
retained the proceeds of that sale. In February 1996 the
plaintiff's truck was
sold, and she retained the net proceeds of sale in an amount of $3,289. On 25
September 1995 the plaintiff's
herd of cattle was sold for $22,816.83 and were
retained by the defendant.
<P>

20	During the course of the relationship both parties participated in the
conduct of the cattle breeding business, although the
nature and extent of that
participation was in dispute. In addition, the defendant alone conducted the
engineering business. The
plaintiff asserted that she performed the role of
attending to the sending out of monthly accounts in the engineering business.
However
that assertion was denied by the defendant. Any involvement by the
plaintiff in the engineering business was, at most, minimal.
<P>

21	The plaintiff during the relationship for short periods (of about two and a
half or three months a year) worked as a wool classer
or as a wool roller. In
the former capacity she was paid $150 a day; in the latter she was paid $25 for
a two hour shift (there being
four shifts a day). That employment also gave
rise to superannuation entitlements, which were paid to the plaintiff (in
amounts totalling
about $400) during the course of the relationship.
<P>

22	She also at times was engaged in a catering business, although it would seem
that little, if any, profit was made from that enterprise.
In addition, she did
what she described as "a bit of bar work".
<P>

23	Apart from the foregoing earnings of the plaintiff during the relationship
(which earnings were deposited by the plaintiff in
a bank account in her sole
name and were, essentially, used for her own separate needs and purposes), the
entirety of the income
of the parties during the course of the relationship was
generated by the cattle breeding business and by the engineering business.
It
was the income from those businesses which was used to support the parties (and
the plaintiff's son Peter), to pay for all household
expenses and outgoings, to
pay all outgoings in respect of Mount Wheogo, and, of course, to meet the
liabilities incurred by each
of the two businesses conducted upon the
property.
<P>

24	According to the plaintiff she was primarily responsible for the cattle
breeding business. She had some experience with cattle,
having worked on a
rural property for thirty years, and having been taught by her father
concerning the breeding of cattle.
<P>

25	I have already recorded my conclusion that, despite her assertion, any
involvement by the plaintiff in the engineering business
was, at most,
minimal.
<P>

26	The defendant disputed the plaintiff's assertion that the stock business was
essentially conducted by her. Whilst the defendant
attended to the entirety of
the engineering business, he asserted that he also was substantially involved
in the cattle breeding
business.
<P>

27	According to the plaintiff each of the businesses conducted on Mount Wheogo
generated a more or less equal income. The defendant
said that the combined
income from the two businesses was at times sufficient to support the family
unit constituted by himself,
the plaintiff and the plaintiff's son Peter, but
that at other times that combined income was not sufficient to support the
family
unit.
<P>

28	During the course of the relationship (probably in 1992 or 1993, although
the plaintiff in her statement of claim said that it
was about 4 June 1991) the
parties commenced to conduct the two businesses through the vehicle of a
company, Postgap Pty. Limited,
("Postgap") in which the plaintiff and the
defendant were equal shareholders and were the only directors. However, it
would appear
that the formal corporate structure of Postgap was essentially
controlled by the defendant, and that the plaintiff had little involvement
in
the formal conduct of that company.
<P>

29	During the relationship additional capital advances were made to Postgap.
These included amounts totalling about $60,000 received
by the defendant from
the estate of his late father, and, in addition, a considerable quantity of
engineering tools (to which the
defendant ascribed a value of $400,000) also
received from that estate.
<P>

30	It will be appreciated that the conduct of each of the two businesses
involved payments being made and income being received.
In addition, the cattle
business involved the breeding and sale of stock, thus generating income, and,
from time to time, the purchase
of additional stock.
<P>

31	At the commencement of the relationship neither party had any liabilities.
However, at the termination of the relationship Postgap
had considerable
liabilities --- including an indebtedness of $100,000 to the defendant. That
liability represents the various advances
made to Postgap by the defendant from
the moneys and the engineering tools which came to him from his father's
estate.
<P>

32	At the conclusion of the relationship the parties (either in their personal
capacity or through the vehicle of Postgap) had the
following liabilities:
<P>

	(a) 	Westpac Term Loan - $27,666
<P>

	(b) 	Westpac cheque account, overdrawn - $36,565
<P>

	(c) 	Various accounts - $75,699
<P>

	(d) 	Balance of lease owing to AGC Limited in respect to 	a bulldozer -
$12,271.
<P>

33	After the termination of the relationship the defendant suffered problems
with his physical and mental health. He therefore decided
to terminate the
engineering business and the cattle business which had been conducted upon the
property, and to take employment
in the town of Parkes. In consequence the
defendant sold the cattle, in September 1995, and organised what was described
in the evidence
as a clearance sale upon Mount Wheogo. That clearance sale was
conducted on 11 February 1996. 
<P>

34	The totality of the cattle on Mount Wheogo (some of which, it will be
appreciated, had been owned by the defendant before the
commencement of the
relationship and some of which had been brought onto that property by the
plaintiff when the relationship commenced)
were sold, in September 1995, that
sale generating about $100,000. The proceeds of sale of those cattle were
treated (at least by
the defendant, and probably, implicitly, also by the
plaintiff) as being owned by Postgap.
<P>

35	From the proceeds of the clearance sale (which generated $88,000) and from
the proceeds of the sale of the cattle (which generated
about $100,000) there
were paid by the defendant all outstanding debts, in relation not only to the
businesses and to Postgap but
also to the parties personally (including, for
example, the debts which the plaintiff had incurred on the defendant's
Mastercard
account). After those payments had been made there remained a sum of
about $11,000. The defendant at that time said that he was prepared
to divide
that sum equally between himself and the plaintiff. Under cross-examination,
however, the defendant said that he was not
sure if he was still prepared to
allow the plaintiff to have one half of that sum.
<P>

36	At the termination of the relationship the assets of the plaintiff included
the truck which she had owned at the commencement
(and which she later disposed
of for $3,289); furniture and personal effects; and a superannuation
entitlement (contributed by Postgap).
<P>

37	The plaintiff seems to have made no attempt since the termination of the
relationship to obtain payment of the superannuation
to which she appears to
have been entitled. Postgap contributed $120 a month towards that
superannuation entitlement. The plaintiff
herself made no contributions towards
that superannuation (which, it will be appreciated, is quite distinct from the
superannuation
entitlements totalling about $400 which the plaintiff received
consequent upon her short periods of employment as a wool classer
and a wool
roller).
<P>

38	In addition the plaintiff took from Mount Wheogo at the termination of the
relationship a ride-on lawn mower (which had been
acquired during the
relationship), which she subsequently sold for $2,500. Another item which the
plaintiff took with her upon her
departure from Mount Wheogo was a Ford Falcon
motor vehicle. That vehicle had originally been purchased during the
relationship with
a gift of $12,000 from the defendant's father. It was
ultimately sold by the plaintiff for $1,200.
<P>

39	Despite the assertion of the plaintiff that she had paid expenses on behalf
of Postgap, when asked under cross-examination why
she did not obtain
reimbursement from the company for those expenses, her response was that she
"just didn't think of it". 
<P>

40	It will be appreciated, from the agreed valuation of Mount Wheogo, that the
value of that property diminished considerably during
the period of the
relationship (from $320,950 to $186,400), although it has increased somewhat
(to $250,300) in the two and a half
years succeeding the termination of their
relationship.
<P>

41	It was not disputed that the plaintiff had the major responsibility for the
domestic activities at Mount Wheogo, although the
defendant asserted that his
participation in those activities was considerably greater than the plaintiff
would concede. The plaintiff
had the primary role as homemaker and as parent to
her son Peter whilst he was part of the family unit.
<P>

42	Although the defendant asserted that he acted in the role of a father to
Peter, that assertion was denied by the plaintiff. The
defendant conceded in
his oral evidence that he and Peter had had their differences, and that for
most of the time they were distant
from each other. Nevertheless, the defendant
after the termination of the relationship accompanied Peter to Sydney with a
view to
the purchase of a motor car by Peter. The defendant advanced to Peter
the sum of $8,000 towards that purchase, that money being regarded
by the
defendant as a gift. Apparently it was also regarded by Peter as a gift, since
it has never been repaid. 
<P>

43	The relationship came to an end when the plaintiff departed from Mount
Wheogo, taking with her her furniture and personal possessions
(that removal
being effected with the physical assistance of the defendant). It was in
consequence of that departure of the plaintiff
that it fell entirely to the
defendant to do all work associated with the winding up of each of the two
businesses. That winding
up extended over the period from August 1995 to
February 1996. 
<P>

44	It was necessary for the defendant to attend to the payment of all debts
owing by the parties and by Postgap. After the termination
of the relationship
the plaintiff made no contributions towards the payment of those debts. This
exercise of winding up the businesses,
which was performed by the defendant,
constituted, so it was submitted on his behalf, a significant contribution by
the defendant,
in that it resulted in reducing the liabilities of the parties,
by getting in amounts from the clearing sale and from the sale of
the
cattle.
<P>

45	The plaintiff asserted that she had little knowledge of and no involvement
in the activities of Postgap, and that she never attended
any meetings of the
company, either in the capacity of a shareholder or in that of a director.
<P>

46	The financial statement of Postgap for the year ended 30 June 1995 contains
an item described as "loan account of directors",
in an amount of $43,862. 
<P>

47	That item, which is not otherwise explained, would appear to suggest an
acknowledgment on the part of the defendant that the
plaintiff (who was the
only other shareholder and director of Postgap) should be entitled to share
equally in the amount of that
loan account.
<P>

48	In my view not only is it not possible, but it is not desirable, that the
outcome of these proceedings should depend upon strictly
arithmetical
calculations (see <i>Evans v Marmont</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a>, especially at 75
per Gleeson CJ and McLelland CJ in Eq). For example, I do not consider that it
would be a correct approach to the
plaintiff's claim to award her the value of
the initial contributions which she said she made to the relationship (asserted
to be
$36,000), or to award to her one half of the directors' loan account
($21,931) plus one half of the balance remaining upon the winding
up of the two
businesses ($5,500) --- a total of $27,431. Such an approach would disregard
not only the plaintiff's own non-financial
contributions to the relationship,
but would also disregard almost the entirety of the contributions, financial
and non-financial,
made by the defendant.
<P>

49	Throughout the period of the relationship the direct and indirect financial
contributions of the plaintiff were considerably
less than those of the
defendant. The indirect contributions of the plaintiff as homemaker and parent
were greater than those of
the defendant. 
<P>

50	It must, however, be appreciated that the relationship and the two
businesses were conducted upon premises which were owned by,
and had for some
years before the commencement of the relationship been occupied by, the
defendant. Throughout the relationship the
household expenditure, as well as
all the expenses associated with the conduct of the two businesses upon the
property, were paid
essentially by the defendant, since the income of the
plaintiff throughout the period of the relationship was significantly less
than
that of the defendant. 
<P>

51	Not only did the plaintiff have the benefit of accommodation in the
defendant's residence throughout the relationship, but also
her son Peter
enjoyed a similar benefit during the relationship. Had the plaintiff not been
in the de facto relationship with the
defendant she herself would have incurred
all the expenses of maintaining a residence for herself and Peter. 
<P>

52	Further, the cattle breeding activities conducted by the plaintiff took
place upon land owned by the defendant, upon which he
himself had been
conducting cattle breeding activities for some years before the commencement of
the relationship. Had the plaintiff
not been in the de facto relationship with
the defendant, it would have been necessary for her to accommodate her herd of
cattle
somewhere else, at cost to herself.
<P>

53	I have reached the conclusion, in all the circumstances of this case, and
conformably with the principles enunciated by the Court
of Appeal in <i>Evans
v. Marmont</i> (in particular, the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and McLelland
CJ in Eq), that it is appropriate that the plaintiff should receive
an order in
her favour which would reflect the predominancy of the plaintiff in the roles
of homemaker and parent. The plaintiff
may have a legal claim to one half of
the assets of Postgap, although her beneficial entitlement to share in those
assets is far
more dubious. However, she should not retain one half of the
assets of Postgap and, in addition, receive an order in her favour (as
was
submitted on her behalf that she should) in the amount of her capital
contribution to the relationship. 
<P>

54	In the exercise of my discretion, I propose to order that the defendant pay
to the plaintiff the sum of $25,000. An order for
the payment to the plaintiff
of that amount will recognise not only the predominancy of the plaintiff in the
role of homemaker and
parent, but also the fact that the direct and indirect
financial contributions of the defendant to the relationship (both at the
commencement of the relationship and during its continuance) were very
significantly greater than those of the plaintiff.
<P>

55	Conformably with the admonition contained in section 19 of the Act
(requiring the Court, so far as is practicable, to "make such
orders as will
finally determine the financial relationships between the de facto partners and
avoid further proceedings between
them"), I propose that an order should be
made which will have the effect of discharging both the defendant and Postgap
from any
entitlement or claim which the plaintiff might otherwise have in
respect to that company and, in particular, to the loan account
of the
directors of Postgap. 
<P>

56	Not only is the amount of $25,000 very much less than the sum of $100,000
originally sought by the plaintiff in her statement
of claim and is less than
the $36,000 sought in the final submission by her Counsel, but --- more
significantly --- that amount is
less than the limit of the jurisdiction of the
Local Court of New South Wales. Thus the plaintiff, in consequence of the
provisions
of Part 52 Rule 24A of the Supreme Court Rules, is not entitled to
her costs unless the Court otherwise orders.
<P>

57	I have not heard any submissions as to costs. Accordingly, unless within
seven days of the date hereof either party arranges
with my Associate for the
matter to be listed for argument as to costs, I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	 I order that the defendant to pay to the plaintiff 	within 28 days of the
date hereof the sum of $25,000.
<P>

	2. 	I order that, upon payment of the foregoing sum by 	the defendant to the
plaintiff, any claim or 	entitlement which the plaintiff
might otherwise have
had in respect to the assets of Postgap Pty. Limited 	shall thereby be
discharged.
<P>

	3. 	I reserve to the parties liberty to apply upon seven 	days' notice in
respect to the implementation of 	order 2 hereof.
<P>

	4. 	I make no order as to costs, to the intent that each 	party shall bear her
or his own costs of the 	proceedings.
<P>

	5. 	The exhibits may be returned.
