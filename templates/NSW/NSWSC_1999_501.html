<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an appeal from a determination of the
Guardianship Tribunal of NSW, the second defendant, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship Act 1987</a> (NSW) against a determination of the Tribunal made on 13
October 1998.  The determination was made in respect of an application by
EMG
to revoke the recognition of a management order made against her in Victoria by
the first defendant whereby the second defendant
was appointed administrator or
manager of her affairs.  The Guardianship Tribunal declined to revoke the
recognition and instead
confirmed its previous determination that the Victorian
order be recognised.
<P>

2	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 57</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship Act 1987</a> (NSW) restricts publication of the
name of any person who is under guardianship.  It is difficult  to comply with
the Court's obligation
as to publishing all its judgments, especially those
like this one which deal with questions of principle, yet not involve people
in
a possible breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57.</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 57</a> clearly does not apply to the Court
itself, but the Court does not wish people who are involved in publishing the
Court's judgments
in the ordinary course of  their business innocently
breaching the section.  Accordingly, matters which may identify EMG have been
put in the appendix to this judgment which will only be available to the
parties plus in the copy that remains in the Court files
and in my retained
copy of the judgment.  This should enable the questions of principle to be
exposed without embarrassing EMG.
<P>

3	EMG's history shows that in 1980 the Victorian Public Trustee, acting on the
advice of two medical practitioners, certified that
EMG was not capable of
managing her affairs.  This had the result that the Public Trustee was the
guardian of EMG's affairs.  EMG
then obtained two medical certificates that she
was no longer incapable and applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria to declare
that
she was no longer incapable.  The Court in considering that application,
considered the test laid down by Powell J in this Court
in <b>PY v RJS
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 700</a>, rejected that test and said that the appropriate test
was a subjective test as to whether the alleged incapable person was able
to
manage the actual affairs that she had to manage and held that she was not so
able.
<P>

4	The jurisdiction then passed to the Guardianship and Administration Board of
Victoria which, from time to time, confirmed orders
that the plaintiff was
incapable.  It would seem that in Victoria the procedure was that such orders
had to be reviewed every so
number of years.  The Victorian Tribunal vested the
management of the affairs of EMG in a Victorian corporation, State Trustees
Limited.
<P>

5	The latest order is 5 June 1997.  The order shows that the Board was
constituted by one Maureen Carruthers and its text reads
as follows:
<P>

	"UPON A REVIEW UNDER S 61 OF THE GUARDIANSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION BOARD ACT
1986 OF THE ADMINISTRATION ORDER MADE ON 17 MARCH, 1993
in respect of (EMG) of
(a north coast NSW address was given)
<P>

	AND UPON THE BOARD BEING SATISFIED THAT (EMG) is disabled within the meaning
of s 3(1) of the Act and is unable by reason of the
disability to make
reasonable judgments in respect of HER ESTATE and needs to be a "represented
person" under the Act
<P>

	THE BOARD HEREBY ORDERS:
<P>

	1.	THAT STATE TRUSTEES LIMITED ... be appointed Administrator(s) of the Estate
of the Represented Person with all the powers and
duties conferred by Part 5
Division 3 and 3A of the Guardianship and Administration Board Act 1986.
<P>

	2.	That this administration order be reviewed by the 5th June 1999.
<P>

	3.	That subject to the provisions of Section 61, this order continue to have
effect until otherwise ordered.
<P>

And that the Represented Person, the Applicant and any other person entitled
thereto, may apply to the Board for a review of its
order at any time."
<P>

6	The facts are that EMG moved to the north coast of NSW in 1994 and has been
residing in NSW ever since.  EMG's husband lives with
her.  Before 1994 EMG and
her husband lived in Victoria, where her children still live.
<P>

7	There was no material at all before the Tribunal as to EMG's domicile on the
date the Victorian Board made its order.  As this
is an appeal from the
Guardianship Tribunal and as the point is not taken, I do not need to dwell on
the matter for this case.  So
far as the Supreme Court is concerned, the Court
has jurisdiction to deal with the estate of an incapable person where it is in
the
interests of the person to do so if that person is physically present
within the State or if that person has property within the
State which needs to
be protected:  <b>MS v ES </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%203%20NSWLR%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 3 NSWLR 199.</a>  That jurisdiction probably
comes from the Royal Prerogative.  However, as the power to make a guardianship
order is committed to
an inferior tribunal, there is no question of the Royal
Prerogative being invoked.  The statute must be construed to see what persons
are within its purview.   The Guardianship Act (NSW) does not actually define
the persons who are subject to its operation.  However,
as the alleged
incapable person must be served and as there does not appear to be any
provision for service interstate, it would
appear that its only jurisdiction is
to deal with people who are physically present within NSW at the date of
service.  Whether that
is so or not can be reserved for another day.
<P>

8	The Victorian Act under which the order was made, the Guardianship and
Administration Board Act 1986 (Vic) has now been drastically
amended by the
Tribunals and Licensing Authorities (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1998 (Vic).
The 1998 Act abolished the Guardianship
and Administration Board and gave its
jurisdiction to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.  
<P>

9	The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was set up under the Civil
and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 (Vic).  There
is no provision in that Act
allowing the Tribunal to be sued by its name.  
<P>

10	Although in England it is common for such bodies to be sued by their public
name, see eg the cases involving the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Boards such
as <b>Reg v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board;  Ex parte Tong </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20WLR%201237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1
WLR 1237</a>, in NSW the procedure was different in that usually the members of an
unincorporated tribunal were named as defendants though it
was the custom not
to name them as the first defendant.  
<P>

11	More recently, proceedings have been brought against tribunals consisting of
more than one person by their official name.  To
take a recent example, in
<b>Torrealba v District Court of New South Wales </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 327</a>, and
in other cases the Court of Appeal has dealt with a matter where the respondent
is the District Court even though a particular
Judge constituted the Court on
that occasion and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act 1973</a> (NSW) does not contain any
provision allowing it to be sued in and by its corporate name.  No objection is
made in the instant case
to either the former Board or the present Tribunal
being sued, but again that is a matter which may need to be reconsidered in
other
cases.
<P>

12	I return now to consider the jurisdiction of the Victorian Guardianship
Board because it is necessary to consider whether that
Board made an order that
was intended to be operative only within Victoria or on property in Victoria or
was intended to be an order
to apply throughout Australia or the world.  
<P>

13	Section 43 of the Guardianship and Administration Board Act 1986 (Vic)
provides for people  to make an application for an administration
order.  The
section as it existed in 1997 provided in subsection (1) for a person to make
an application for guardianship, subsection
(2) then was as follows:
<P>

	"Where a person with a disability who has attained the age of 18 years does
not reside in Victoria but has an estate the whole
or part of which is in
Victoria, any person may apply to the Board for an order appointing an
administrator in respect of so much
of the estate as is in Victoria."
<P>

	Section 61, in its then form, provided that the Board must within three years
of the making of a guardianship order or an administration
order hold a hearing
to review the order.
<P>

	Section 63 provided that upon completing a review "The Board may by order
amend, vary, continue or replace the order subject to
any conditions or
requirements it considers necessary or revoke the order."
<P>

14	As can be seen from the order that I have already set out, the Board in
Victoria did none of the things referred to in s 63 but
made a fresh order
appointing an administrator.  That order as I have said, purported to give the
administrator all the powers and
duties under Divisions 3 and 3A of the
Guardianship and Administration Board Act (Vic).  Section 58B which is
contained within Division
3A purports to empower the administrator to sell,
exchange, partition or convert into money any property of the incapable person
or to pay, settle, adjust or compromise any debt or demand.  As an initial
order could only have been made in respect of property
in Victoria because of s
43(2), the order made by the Victorian Board was too wide.  In so far as it
extended beyond giving power
to deal with EMG's property in Victoria, the order
had no effect.  It was not an order of a superior court, it was an order of an
administrative tribunal.  It thus had no effect outside Victoria or with
respect to anything to do with the incapable person other
than her property
within Victoria.
<P>

15	I might note here that there was little evidence as to where the incapable
person's property was.  There was evidence that she
held shares in a company
which owned a property in Sorrento Victoria, but there was no evidence at all
at least before the NSW Tribunal
as to where that company was incorporated or
where the shares were situated.  If I were permitted a guess (which I am not),
I would
guess that the shares actually were in Victoria, but it would have been
nice had there been some evidence before the Board in Victoria
or the Tribunal
in NSW. 
<P>

16	The significance of this sort of analysis becomes plain when one looks at
<b>Re Hancock </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%2080%20WN%20%28NSW%29%2056" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 80 WN (NSW) 56.</a> Although this decision has been
criticised academically, as far as I am aware its status has never been
questioned in the court system.
 In <b>Hancock's case</b>, the mother of an
ex-nuptial child had her legitimated under a Victorian Act of Parliament.  The
question was whether that legitimation
would be recognised in NSW.  Myers J
held that at common law the legitimation would only be recognised if done in
accordance with
the law of the father's domicile.  He also held that the full
faith and credit provisions did not require courts in NSW to do anything
more
than recognise that in Victoria the child was legitimate.  As the Victorian law
did not have the power to declare that a person
was legitimate outside the
bounds of Victoria, that was its only operation.  Accordingly, the child
legitimated under the law of
Victoria could not inherit in NSW as a child.  
<P>

17	I should note that I was asked by Mr E Strasser who appears for the
plaintiff/appellant to consider the Parliamentary debates
in Victoria before
reaching a conclusion as to the meaning of the Victorian Act.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 34</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act 1987</a> (NSW) allows me to look at the relevant
Parliamentary papers where the meaning of a statutory provision is unclear.
However that
section does not permit me to look at Victorian Parliamentary
papers if in the course of making a decision I need to construe Victorian
legislation.  In any event, the Victorian Act appears to me to be fairly
plain.
<P>

18	I now turn to the question as to whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s48b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship Act 1987</a>
(NSW) affects the scope of the Victorian order if it is recognised.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s48b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
48B(1)</a> stripped of unnecessary verbiage, merely provides "A person who, under a
corresponding law, is appointed as the guardian of another
person may apply to
the Tribunal for recognition of his or her status as such."  Subsection (2)
then provides "The Tribunal must
recognise the applicant if satisfied that the
applicant has been so appointed".  Subsection (5) provides "The applicant's
recognition
may be reviewed, varied and revoked as if it were an appointment
under this Act."
<P>

19	The question is, what is the effect of recognition of the Victorian order in
the present case?
<P>

20	No legislation would be needed if all that was happening was that this State
recognised that the Victorian administrator was
able to administer property in
Victoria.  There would be no necessary nexus with NSW nor any utility.
Accordingly one must suppose
that the legislation was intended to do something
else.  
<P>

21	Counsel submit that the full faith and credit provisions are not applicable
in this area because what happened before the Guardianship
Board in Victoria
was not a judicial proceeding within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 118</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
Although I do not know of any case directly in point, the answer would appear
to be that the proceedings are not judicial proceedings
and this view is
reinforced by the decision of Powell J in <b>Re an Alleged Incapable Person FCC
and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 541.</a>
<P>

22	What then, does s 48B of the Guardianship Act (NSW) mean by
"recognition"?
<P>

23	I have seen the Minister's Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Council
when the Guardianship Amendment Bill was introduced
and I agree with counsel
that it is of no assistance on the resolution of the current problem.  
<P>

24	The word "recognition" or "recognise" is a commonly used word when a law is
indicating that a judgment with regard to status
made outside the State is to
have as much force within the State as it had in the place where it was made.
Thus one finds the heading
to Part XII of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act 1975</a> (Cth) a group
of sections on recognition of decrees outside Australia and one finds similar
provisions in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/" class="autolink_findacts">Adoption of Children Act 1965</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part V</a> (NSW).
<P>

25	However, s 48B seems to go further than merely recognising within NSW a
person's status.  This is because subsection (3) says,
"On recognition, the
applicant is taken to be appointed under this Act as guardian or manager of the
estate ...".  
<P>

26	The section has a rather strange effect.  So long as there are corresponding
laws, then if a person has been appointed guardian
in another State the
Tribunal must recognise not the order but the applicant and then the applicant
is taken to be appointed under
this Act as guardian.
<P>

27	Thus it is not the foreign order that is recognised, but the applicant's
right to represent the alleged incapable person in NSW.
 The Guardianship Board
is given no discretion to decline to recognise the applicant, but at least on
one argument, under subsection
(5) it may as soon as it has recognised the
applicant, revoke that recognition "as if it were an appointment under this
Act".  Under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship Act 1987</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s25u.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25U</a>, the Tribunal may revoke an
appointment of a manager only in three situations:  (a)  if the manager seeks
revocation,  (b)  "the
Tribunal is satisfied that it is in the best interests
of the protected person that the appointment be revoked,  or (c)  the financial
management order in respect of the estate concerned is revoked".   Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s25p.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25P</a>
a financial management order may be revoked "only if:  (a)  the Tribunal is
satisfied that the protected person is capable of managing
his or her affairs,
or (b)  the Tribunal considers that it is in the best interests of the
protected person that the order be revoked
(even though the Tribunal is not
satisfied that the protected person is capable of managing his or her
affairs)."
<P>

28	In the instant case, the Guardianship Tribunal on 24 March 1998 issued a
determination alleging that pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ga1987136/s48b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48B</a> "the order dated 5 June 1997 made
by the Guardianship and Administration Board of Victoria ... is hereby
recognised."  This, in my
view, was not an accurate statement;  it was only the
status of the applicant, State Trustees of Victoria, which was recognised.
However, the order then went on to say that "This order having been recognised
the State Trustees of Victoria is now taken to be
appointed as manager of the
estate of EMG under the Act."
<P>

29	EMG, by her solicitor's letter of 21 July 1998, applied to revoke a
financial management order on the ground that EMG "considers
herself capable of
managing her own financial affairs".
<P>

30	The Tribunal in its determination of 13 October 1998 treated that
application as an application to revoke recognition of a financial
management
order, which of course, it was not, both because the Tribunal should never have
recognised the foreign order but only
the status of the foreign manager, and in
any event that was not what EMG had applied for the Tribunal to do.  However,
the Tribunal
said "In view of the wording of section 48B(5), this application
should strictly have been couched as an application to revoke the
Tribunal's
recognition of the Victorian order.  The Tribunal treated EMG's application as
such.  ...
<P>

	"Putting aside the technical legal label of the current application, its
effect if successful would have been to revoke the NSW
financial management
order.  It would not have revoked the appointment of the State Trustees under
the Victorian Legislation.  The
NSW Tribunal has no such power. 
<P>

"If EMG's application was successful, the control of the State Trustees over
EMG's Victorian assets (which include savings and an
interest in a family
company) would have remained.
<P>

"It would also appear that the State Trustees may have retained legal control
over any movable property of EMG in NSW.  (The only
significant such property
appeared to be a car).  However and very significantly here, it would appear
that EMG would have resumed
full legal control over the house that she owns in
Ballina, NSW. ...
<P>

"EMG asked the Tribunal to revoke its recognition of the Victorian order on the
basis that she was capable of managing her own financial
affairs.  The Tribunal
thus needed to be satisfied that this was the case (s 25P(2)(a))."
<P>

31	The Tribunal then set out its reasons for determining that EMG had not shown
she was capable of managing her own financial affairs.
 Mr Strasser was
critical of the way in which the Tribunal went about its determination of fact.
He said that although material was
presented to the Tribunal on behalf of EMG
by her solicitor, the Tribunal also, without any forecasting of what the
material might
be, took evidence by telephone whilst it was sitting in Lismore.
EMG had no notice of what this material was, no opportunity to confer
with her
lawyers about it, and no opportunity to reply to it.  Furthermore, the Tribunal
prevented EMG from taping the hearing and
thus prevented her from making any
accurate record of what was happening.
<P>

32	It is also put that one of the witnesses, a Ms Sue Packer who describes
herself as a neuropsychologist was a person who was too
close to the Tribunal
to be able to give evidence fairly.
<P>

33	One of the people who gave evidence by phone was EMG's son, AM.  AM said
that there was a family company in Victoria in which
EMG had a one-sixth
interest worth approximately $45,000.  AM did not give very material evidence,
but at what appeared to be the
end of it, the Chairman of the Board said, "I
will just check whether your mother wants to ask you anything.  Is there
anything you
wanted to ask your son?" to which EMG said "Yes, give him my
love".  However, then there were another two pages of conversation between
the
Chairman and AM during which AM said that the Victorian Tribunal took the view
that none of the doctors' reports warranted revocation
of the Victorian order
and "This has been I'm afraid a very long harrowing matter for the family and
my mother but at the end of
the day we are firmly of the view, based on the
medical evidence which has been obtained over the years, that she unfortunately
is
not managing her affairs. ... That is purely because of her memory
difficulties I mean she is not getting any younger".
<P>

34	EMG was not asked to reply to this "evidence".  
<P>

35	The Tribunal then took a short break and after it resumed, the following
appears in the transcript:  
<P>

"(inaudible)
<P>

(EMG's husband):  She is one of your mob is she?
<P>

Speaker:   	             Yes."
<P>

36	The Chairman then rang up Ms Packer and said "Is that Sue Packer?"  The
respondent replied in the affirmative and the Chairman
then said "The
Guardianship Tribunal, Sue" to which the reply was "Hi, how are you?"  Each
member of the Tribunal then said "Hello"
to the witness and after various
preliminaries the Chairman said "You have suggested there that with the
assistance   from someone
like a financial planner that EMG would be able to
manage."
<P>

	Ms Packer:		"Yes".
<P>

	Chairman:		"How would she go if she didn't have that sort assistance?"
<P>

	Ms Packer:		"I think it would be very difficult for her.  I think she could
make basis decisions that she could probably manage
small amounts of money on a
day to day basis but I think with larger amounts they could become quite
confusing for her mainly due
to the fact that she has quite a significant
memory impairment.  So it would be hard for her to keep track of things and
that is
why I felt she needed that kind of support.
<P>

	I understand that she manages very well on a day to day basis in managing the
household affairs and her own banking needs, but
I felt that if it came to
investing a large amount of money and that sort of thing she could really
benefit from some outside help.
 Certainly her husband is very supportive of
her ... and he seems to be sufficient to provide a certain amount of that kind
of support
but I still felt it doesn't hurt to have some external input and
advice into managing one's estate." 
<P>

37	The community member of the Board then said, "Sue, its Freda".  Ms Packer:
              "Hi".
<P>

	Community member:   "How do you think EMG would go about choosing a financial
adviser..."
<P>

38	When she finally answered this question, Ms Packer said:  "I think she would
probably be in a position of vulnerability.  I wouldn't
feel totally confident
that she could manage effectively, you know, if she were left totally alone".

<P>

Chairman:	        "Okay, alright.  EMG is there anything you would like to ask
Sue Packer while we have her on the phone?"
<P>

EMG:                   "Not really".
<P>

EMG's husband:  "Thank her for her report".
<P>

Ms Packer:            "Okay, it is no problem".
<P>

39	Tribunals such as the Guardianship Board have to be extremely careful about
the way they proceed.  They are presented with a
number of difficulties
inherent in their makeup.  They are not bound by the rules of evidence and may
inform themselves in any way
they think appropriate.  However, this is subject
to the rules of natural justice that people should be given an opportunity to
answer
the allegations that are made against them.  The proceedings need to be
conducted with a minimum of formality, but care must be taken
that informality
does not lead to denial of natural justice.  Such Tribunals need also to
remember that what is "informal" in one
setting may be almost insulting in
another.  Many elderly ladies who have been used to being called "Mrs Smith"
throughout their
lives do get offended if some person on a tribunal much
younger than themselves calls them by their first name.
<P>

40	There are inherent dangers for a Tribunal when a person is working as a
psychologist in close harmony with the Protective Office
or the Guardianship
Tribunal and gives evidence on many occasions and is doubtless known
professionally to members of the Tribunal.
 The temptation is for that person's
evidence to be taken at face value in all cases.  That must be avoided.
Furthermore, the impression
that one witness, because of her association with
the Tribunal, is more likely to be accepted than others must also be avoided.

<P>

41	Mr Strasser was very critical of the way in which he says the Chairman would
put words into witnesses' mouths which they would
then acknowledge as being
correct.  It is certainly true that all judges and members of tribunals must be
particularly careful not
to put words or suggestions into witnesses' minds and
mouths because experience shows that witnesses will tend to agree with the
tribunal because they think that that is the respectful thing to do.  This
problem occurs with certain types of witnesses more than
others, but it applies
generally.
<P>

42	However, I do not consider, having looked at the transcript as a whole, that
the Tribunal went too far in this direction on this
particular occasion such as
would lead it to be subject to review by the Supreme Court.  The Court has to
be particularly careful
where there is a tribunal that is expected to go about
its business in an informal and pastoral way not to be over-delicate about
the
way in which evidence is gathered.
<P>

43	Furthermore it is again true that the Tribunal must give the defendant or
applicant the chance of contradicting material which
is put before it and if
need be, may have to grant an adjournment for that to be done.  In a tribunal
such as the present where lawyers
are only allowed with the permission of the
tribunal, a tribunal may indeed have a duty to point out to an applicant or
defendant
that if he or she does consider that an adjournment is needed, they
have a right to ask for it.  It may not be sufficient in any
particular case to
just say to an unrepresented person at the end of evidence which has been given
by telephone (or by a witness
personally present) against them for the first
time, of which they had no notice, that they can ask questions over the
telephone
of the witness if they want to.
<P>

44	However, having said all this it does not seem to me that in the instant
case the Board went into the area where its proceedings
denied natural justice
in any of these respects.
<P>

45	The next question is whether the Board applied the wrong test.
<P>

46	The Board said that it was applying the test in <b>PY v RJS </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2
NSWLR 700.</a>  In that case Powell J held that a person is incapable of managing
his or her own affairs if that person appears incapable of dealing
in a
reasonably competent fashion with ordinary routine affairs and that any lack of
such competence may disadvantage him or her
in the conduct of such affairs or
his or her money or property may be dissipated or lost.  That test which has
been followed in this
State from time to time is easier for the alleged
incapable person to satisfy than the test which prevails in Victoria known in
NSW
as "the subjective test" which was expounded by Starke J in <b>Re MacGregor
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/85.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 85</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20VR%20861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] VR 861.</a>  In that case his Honour said that the test is whether the
alleged incapable person is able to manage his or her own affairs as they
exist
in actuality.  Accordingly, a multi-millionaire with complex affairs would be
more likely to be declared an incapable person
than a pensioner living in a
retirement village without any property interests.
<P>

47	As EMG was a Victorian, her initial incapacity was judged by the subjective
test.  She was more likely to succeed if the objective
test set out in <b>PY v
RJS </b>(supra)<b> </b>was applied and she can't complain that that was the
test which the Guardianship Tribunal purported to apply.
<P>

48	However, Mr Strasser says that when one reads the judgment of the Tribunal,
although it said it was applying the objective test
it in fact applied the
subjective test.  For this submission it is necessary to go back to the reasons
of decision of the Tribunal.
<P>

49	At p 11 of its reasons, the Tribunal, after citing the test in <b>PY v
RJS</b> (supra) said, "The Tribunal needed to be satisfied that EMG was capable
of managing her affairs.  Accordingly ... the Tribunal needed
to first consider
whether it was satisfied that EMG appeared capable of dealing, in a reasonably
competent fashion, with the ordinary
routine affairs of people.  If the
Tribunal was satisfied of this, EMG was entitled to the order that she sought."
The Tribunal then
set out the other limb of the test which does not call for
consideration at this moment.
<P>

50	After reviewing the evidence the Tribunal said at p 15, "Could the Tribunal
be satisfied that EMG was capable of dealing in a
reasonably competent fashion
with the ordinary routine affairs of people?  It seemed to the Tribunal that
such affairs encompass
matters such as dealings with one's home and the issues
relating to health insurance, pensions and choice of financial advisers.
 It
seemed to the Tribunal that, for EMG to be reasonably competent as required,
she would need to be able to either personally carry
out these tasks or be
reasonably discerning in her choice of assistance and her capacity to evaluate
the advice from such assistance.
 This assistance might be from a family member
and/or professional advisers.
<P>

"Weighing up the above evidence, it seemed to the Tribunal that EMG's `severe,
generalised memory difficulties' when combined with
her `difficulties with her
high level attentional processes and perceptual organisation' and her dysphasia
made it at least doubtful
whether EMG was so competent.
<P>

"To the extent that Ms Packer's conclusions suggested otherwise to the above,
it relied upon others to compensate for EMG's severe
memory problems.  It did
not seem to the Tribunal that a person could be said to be capable if the
person was dependent on others
to compensate for such a basic cognitive
deficit.
<P>

"The Tribunal could therefore not be satisfied that EMG was capable of dealing
in a reasonably competent fashion with the ordinary
routine affairs of
people."
<P>

51	It seems to me from that passage that the Tribunal kept the appropriate test
before it and assessed EMG in the light of that
test.  Accordingly I do not
consider that the plaintiff's point that the wrong test was in fact applied has
been established.
<P>

52	The next problem is whether the Tribunal misdirected itself that whatever it
did could have no effect upon the Victorian order
other than that order's
operation in NSW.
<P>

53	Mr Strasser submits that s 48B of the Guardianship Act (NSW) could not make
practical sense unless the revocation of the Guardianship
Tribunal's order also
neutered the foreign board's order.
<P>

54	Although I was for a while attracted by Mr Strasser's argument, in my view
the key to understanding s 48B is to understand that
the order of a foreign
court or tribunal is not recognised but rather it is the status of the
applicant, guardian or manager that
is recognised.  That status is
automatically recognised under s 48B(2) and that then gives the applicant the
same powers as if he,
she or it had been appointed in NSW.
<P>

55	Thus it does not matter that, as in this case, the Victorian order was only
over Victorian assets.  The applicant before the
Tribunal was a person who came
within the description of s 48B(1) and upon recognition the applicant had power
over the assets of
EMG in NSW as if an initial order had been made under the
NSW Act.                The revocation of that order would take away the
power
to deal with NSW assets, but as the Tribunal ruled it would have no direct
effect on the Victorian order.
<P>

56	The revocation of the NSW order may, however, have an indirect effect on the
Victorian order.  If the parties to the revocation
application were, as they
should be, the alleged incapable person on one side and the Victorian manager
on the other side, and a
tribunal in NSW makes a determination that the person
is no longer incapable, it may be that that will operate as an estoppel before
the Victorian Tribunal when an application is made to discharge the order
there.  The Guardianship Tribunal would appear to be a
judicial statutory
tribunal within the meaning of the issue estoppel rules rather than an
administrative tribunal;  see <b>Pastras v The Commonwealth </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%209%20FLR%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 9 FLR
152</a>, 155.
<P>

57	It might be thought that there is some problem on issue estoppel because the
test used in Victoria, the subjective test based
on <b>Re MacGregor </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/85.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 85</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20VR%20861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985]
VR 861</a>, is more difficult for the alleged incapable person to establish that
she is now capable as opposed to the objective test used in
NSW.  My present
view, however, is that the ultimate fact is capacity and it would be that on
which there would be an issue estoppel
notwithstanding the fact the tribunals
in the two different States apply a slightly different test.
<P>

58	 An interesting question would arise if the Victorian order came to an end.
If it came to an end because the Victorian Tribunal
held that EMG was no longer
incapable, then that would probably be an issue estoppel which would bind the
NSW Tribunal when EMG made
an application to revoke the recognition.  However,
if for instance, the Victorian order came to an end by effluxion of time,
it
may be that the alleged incapable person could not revoke the NSW order
unless she could prove that she was no longer incapable in
NSW.  However, the
better view would appear to be that once the Victorian order ceases then the
status which was conferred by the
Victorian order and is recognised in NSW
comes to an end so that the NSW order would for all intents and purposes have
no further
operation.  However I do not consider that this proposition means
that one can argue the converse case.  
<P>

59	I should mention one further matter, and that is, that the State Trustees
Victoria are not a party to this appeal.  I would have
thought they should have
been a party, but as there have been proper contradictors it is not a matter of
great moment.
<P>

60	For these reasons the appeal should be dismissed.  No argument has been put
to me as to costs.  Accordingly I will reserve the
question of costs but on the
basis that if no application has been made in respect of costs by any party by
15 June 1999 the formal
order may be entered as "Appeal dismissed.  No order as
to costs".  An application for costs may be made by letter received by my
Associate no later than 15 June asking that the matter be listed on a Monday
when I am taking the Protective List.
