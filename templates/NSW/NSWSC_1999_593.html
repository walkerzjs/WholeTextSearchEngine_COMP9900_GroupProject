<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY 4 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>2337/99 - EVANS &amp; ORS T/AS SHAW MCDONALD V LOXLEY &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   Disputes over solicitors' costs can get very heated and
this is no exception.  The first defendant was suing the second defendant
and
others for professional negligence.  She had a series of solicitors.  In
between April 1997 and November 1997 she indicated she
would retain the
plaintiffs as her solicitors in the professional negligence proceedings.
<P>

2	The first defendant was sent a costs agreement on or about 9 April 1997 which
suggested that the plaintiffs would charge at the
rate of $250 per hour for a
partner and $190 per hour for a senior solicitor plus disbursements,
photocopying, et cetera.  They also
estimated that collating information
relating to her claim would be in the vicinity of $6-12,000 and phase 2, being
pursuit of the
court action, another $6-12,000.
<P>

3	The plaintiffs say that they received back the executed costs agreement on 5
September and only then did they get on to the record
of the professional
negligence proceedings, which were pending in the District Court of New South
Wales.  They stayed on the record
until November 1997.
<P>

4	The first defendant denies that she ever signed the agreement.  She says that
the plaintiffs were too expensive for her and she
just could not afford to be
locked into a situation with such expensive legal services.
<P>

5	It is more likely than not in my opinion that the plaintiffs did receive back
the agreement signed on 5 September.  Their action
in changing from merely
appearing on the record as an agent to preparing a notice of change of
solicitor and the different role they
assumed after that date is just
inexplicable, unless something such as the return of the signed agreement made
them change their
position.
<P>

6	The plaintiffs sent to the first defendant a series of what they felicitously
call "bills".  The first was on 16 May 1997. This
was on any view of the
matter, before the costs agreement was signed.   The second was on 30 September
1997 and there was a third
bill dated 13 April 1999.
<P>

7	The first bill of May could not refer to a costs agreement because there was
not any.  However, the covering letter referred to
the "copy costs agreement
that I provided to you" in the first paragraph, and in the last paragraph
mentioned that the client was
only required to pay half the amount by reason of
the arrangement set out in that letter.
<P>

8	The bill itself did not contain any reference to the draft costs agreement.
The bill was addressed to Mrs J S Loxley.  It was
on letterhead.  It was headed
"Re Medical Negligence Claim" and it concluded with the words "Yours
faithfully, SHAW McDONALD".
<P>

9	Mr Burke, who appeared for the plaintiffs, said that under regulation 22A of
the Legal Profession Regulation 1994 one could read
the covering letter with
the bill because a bill of costs may comprise more than one document.  However,
where one has a completely
self-contained bill one cannot or does not do this.
There being no reference to the costs agreement or other disclosure document
the exemption in regulation 22A(2) does not apply to the "bill" of 19 May 1997.
Again the "bill" of 30 September 1997 does not do
this.
<P>

10	Accordingly, there were no bills which came within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 192</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s199.html" class="autolink_findacts">199</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>.  Thus, most of the orders sought in the summons by
the plaintiffs, which focussed on the plaintiffs being paid moneys by the first
defendant, could not be obtained.
<P>

11	A notice of motion was issued about the time the summons was filed for an
order setting up and imposing a lien on the moneys
that the present first
defendant was found entitled to from the present second defendant by the
District Court.
<P>

12	Last week Brownie AJ granted some relief in respect of such a lien.  Today
Mr Burke indicated that the only final relief he sought
was to continue that as
a final order.  He submitted that the form in which Brownie AJ made the order
it continued even after the
disposal of the suit, but that just cannot be
right.
<P>

13	Accordingly, I have to examine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a lien
until their bill is properly assessed in accordance
with law.
<P>

14	There have been a series of cases over the last two hundred years to the
effect that if a solicitor expends labour or incurs
disbursements, which, at
least in a significant way, contributes to a fund of money being recovered by
the client, then the solicitor
is entitled to a lien over that fund until paid
what is properly due to him or her.
<P>

15	The solicitor must establish a number of matters in order to qualify for
that lien.  First the solicitor must show that his or
her work did
substantially contribute to the bringing about of the fund.  I have dealt with
that matter at some length in<b> Kelso v McCulloch</b>, 24 October 1994,
unreported and more recently in<b> Abdul-Karim v Attorney General's
Department</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 79.</a>
<P>

16	Secondly, the solicitor is only entitled to have a lien in respect of so
much of the fund as the court considers reasonable between
the parties and will
have regard to what is likely to be allowed on taxation and what is
attributable to the production of the fund
as opposed to collateral matters,
such as advising the client generally (<b>Johns v Cassel</b> (1993) 6 BPR
13134, 13136).
<P>

17	In the instant case, it seems to me that the solicitors did contribute in a
significant way to the judgment, in that from what
is before me, when these
solicitors took over the first defendant's case was not in a particularly ready
state and the defendants
in the District court proceedings had moved to strike
it out.  It would seem that the learned District Court Judge declined to strike
the matter out but ordered the present first defendant to pay the costs of the
motion which would suggest that it was the efforts
of the present plaintiffs
that secured a merciful result.
<P>

18	The plaintiffs did do much more than acquaint themselves with all the facts
of the case.  They also worked out what medical examinations,
et cetera, the
first defendant needed to submit to, and obtain reports about her health, but
by November 1997 they had ceased to
be involved.
<P>

19	Some of the work that was done by the solicitors was work which was properly
done within their retainer, but that is not the
question that I have to
consider.  I have to consider what work helped produce that fund over which the
solicitors are now seeking
a lien.
<P>

20	Clearly the motion, in fact the two motions before the District Court were
in that category, as were the disbursements paid to
Miss Foord, barrister, to
appear on them.
<P>

21	However, the work done by the solicitors in acquainting themselves with the
facts of the case and generally in becoming au fait
with the matter, insofar as
they did not directly relate to the motions, was work properly done, but not
work which helped produce
the fund.
<P>

22	There was a considerable amount of argument about the form and content of
the bills.  Mr Evatt, appearing for the first defendant,
questioned whether a
draft costs agreement sent to the client was a "disclosure document" within
Regulation 22A.  He asked whether
a costs agreement specifying an hourly rate
permitted the solicitors unilaterally to charge a rate of 10% of the hourly
rate for
each 6 minute unit with a minimum charge of 1 unit.  There were
particular queries about a fee of $875 for a "conference" over a
cup of coffee
in a hotel with the client;  a fee of $76 for walking 2.5 blocks from the
solicitors' offices to the District Court
and back and a fee of $750 for
"reviewing file and documents".  However these are really matters to be
considered by the costs assessor
in due course.
<P>

23	Going through the bill, it would seem as a rough estimate that only about
$2,500, plus the fee owing to Miss Foord, is work which
helped to produce the
fund.  It may well be that when things are looked at more thoroughly than I
have had the time to do today,
some more should be permitted.
<P>

24	If one adds on another $1,000 for that possibility one gets to $4,300.
<P>

25	So far as the $4,300 is concerned, it seems to me that that work went
towards obtaining the fund and that there is a danger,
quite obviously from the
rest of the evidence, that unless a lien is imposed the plaintiffs will never
receive that sum.
<P>

26	I have assumed that the plaintiffs have either paid Miss Foord her $800 or
will in due course undertake so to do. Therefore I
will assume that they are
entitled to the disbursements as well as the costs.
<P>

27	Accordingly, a proper order is that the second defendant is to retain $4,300
of any moneys for verdict or costs otherwise due
to the first defendant pending
assessment of a proper bill of costs between the first defendant and the
plaintiffs.  I reserve liberty
to apply so that final orders can be made.
<P>

28	So far as costs of these proceedings are concerned, I think that really the
matter was a bit of a draw.  The plaintiffs sought
far too much in their
original summons, yet on the other hand I have accepted the plaintiffs' case on
the question of fact and the
question of the lien.
<P>

29	However, the second defendant has been brought to court more or less as a
submitting party and the plaintiffs should pay the
second defendant's costs as
on a submitting appearance.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

                                                                         <b>
