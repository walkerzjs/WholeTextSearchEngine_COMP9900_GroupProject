<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES </b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>N300167/94   -   ROBERT VINCENT LEE  v  </b>
<P>

<b>			MARK ALEXANDER KEAN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Extension of time - s 52(4) MAA)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 9 October 1998 the plaintiff seeks
that leave be granted to commence proceedings pursuant to s 52(4) of
the
<b>Motor Accidents Act</b>.  The plaintiff relies on his affidavit sworn 29
October 1998 and the affidavits of Ross Pfennigwerth sworn 28 September 1998
and
Mark Ambrose Whelan sworn 12 October 1998.  The defendant opposes the
application.  
<P>

2	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
<P>

(1)	On 8 July 1987, a bus in which the plaintiff was travelling as a passenger
was involved in a motor accident.  The plaintiff
suffered injuries as a result
of the accident.  
<P>

(2)	On 14 July 1987, the plaintiff completed a workers compensation form.
<P>

(3)	Shortly after the motor vehicle accident the plaintiff sought legal advice
and as a consequence believed that he did not have
any entitlement to make a
claim for workers compensation or under the <b>Transport Accident Act</b> 1987.
After receiving that advice he took no further steps to pursue the claim which
he had filed with his employer Coal and Allied
Industries Pty Limited.
<P>

(4)	In November 1989, the plaintiff was contacted by Mr Ross Pfennigwerth a
solicitor then in the employ of Geoffrey Edwards and
Company Newcastle.  Mr
Pfennigwerth had contacted the plaintiff as a potential witness in proceedings
where another passenger was
injured in the accident.  
<P>

(5)	On 29 June 1990, the plaintiff sought further advice from Mr Pfennigwerth
regarding injuries which he sustained in the bus accident.
 The plaintiff
understood that Mr Pfennigwerth was acting as his solicitor in respect of any
rights which he might have in relation
to compensation or damages in relation
to the bus accident.  
<P>

(6)	On 29 June 1990, the plaintiff's solicitor commenced proceedings by filing
a statement of claim in the Newcastle Supreme Court.
 The 30 June 1990 was the
cut off date to commence proceedings in Transcover matters.  A defence was
filed raising non-compliance
with s 43 of the <b>Motor Accidents Act</b>  The
plaintiff 
<P>

filed a motion seeking orders to satisfy s 43 of the <b>Motor Accidents
Act</b>.  On 5 March 1993, the plaintiff consented to the notice of motion
being dismissed and the statement of claim being struck out (Ex
1).
<P>

(7)	The plaintiff says that he has intended to pursue any rights which he has.
He relied on the advice he had received from his
solicitors and barristers and
he had attempted to comply with all the requests communicated by the solicitors
including requests
that he attend for medical examinations and provide further
instructions.
<P>

(8)	On 25 October 1990, a <b>Motor Accidents Act</b> claim form was forwarded
to the GIO it did not attach a certificate of the statement of earnings.  The
plaintiff was requested by
his solicitor to take the form to his employer Coal
and Allied Industries Pty Limited.  He did so but despite his request, the
employer
did not return the form to him prior to his resignation.  It appears
that the plaintiff made no further attempts to obtain the completed
form.
<P>

(9)	On 11 January 1991, the GIO requested a full and satisfactory
explanation.
<P>

(10)	On 25 May 1992, the plaintiff completed a statutory declaration for the
purpose of providing a satisfactory explanation.  In
this documents the
plaintiff says that it was not until November 1990 that he consulted his
present solicitors yet in his affidavit
he referred to seeking advice from that
solicitor on 29 June 1990.  In both the statutory declaration and the affidavit
he says that
he came into contract with his current firm of solicitors when he
was approached as a witness to the accident.  The 29 June 1990
most likely
relates to the plaintiff being approached to be a witness.  I find that the
plaintiff first sought legal advice from
Geoffrey Edwards and Company in
November 1990.  The explanation was rejected.
<P>

(11)	On 31 October 1994, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim in these
proceedings (the second statement of claim).
<P>

(12)	In 1995 Mr Pfennigwerth left the employ of Geoffrey Edwards and Company.
Mr Pfennigwerth has no independent recollection of
the plaintiff nor of the
contents of the solicitor's file.  
<P>

(13)	On 1 February 1996, the GIO arranged for the plaintiff to be medically
examined by Dr Donaldson on 10 May 1996.
<P>

(14)	On 16 May 1996, the defendant's solicitor advised the plaintiff's
solicitor that the plaintiff did not attend the medical examination.
 On 2
September 1996 and 18 November 1996 the defendant's solicitor wrote to the
plaintiff's solicitor seeking explanation for the
plaintiff's non-attendance at
this medical examination.  There was no reply.
<P>

(15)	In 1994 the plaintiff gave evidence in workers compensation proceedings
taken on his behalf.  Shortly after giving evidence
in those proceedings he
recalled that he was advised by Mr Pfennigwerth that he was unlikely to succeed
in those proceedings because
the motor vehicle accident that occurred on the 8
July 1987 did not appear to fall within the bounds of the workers compensation
legislation.  Judgment apparently has not been delivered in this matter.  After
receiving that advice, and as he did not receive
any further messages for some
time, he assumed that he was not entitled to any compensation for damages and
the litigation in relation
to the bus accident was at an end.  Because of that
assumption, when he changed his address he did not inform the solicitor of his
whereabouts.
<P>

(16)	In 1995 the plaintiff instructed other solicitors to take Compensation
Court proceedings in relation to another accident. 
This accident occurred in
his employment with the Department of Corrective Services and related to an
injury to his right hand.
<P>

(17)	The plaintiff's current solicitor, Mr Mark Whelan of Geoffrey Edwards and
Company assumed conduct of this matter and retained
the services of a private
investigator to locate the plaintiff.  The private investigator located the
plaintiff on 27 May 1998.
<P>

(18)	On 28 August 1997, the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendant's
solicitors informing them that they had been instructed
to proceed with this
matter.
<P>

(19)	In late May 1998 he was contacted by an investigator on behalf of Geoffrey
Edwards and Company.  On 9 June 1998, the plaintiff
attended a conference with
Mr Whelan solicitor and Mr Cahill of 
<P>

counsel.  As a consequence of that advice received from the barrister he
renewed his instructions to Geoffrey Edwards and Company
to pursue his
entitlement to damages under the <b>Motor Accidents Act</b>.
<P>

(20)	On 9 October 1998, this notice of motion was filed.
<P>

3	The parties agree that the plaintiff was required to file a notice of claim
by 31 December 1989 and file a statement of claim
by 30 June 1990.
<P>

4	I turn now to the plaintiff's explanation of delay in commencing proceedings
pursuant to s 43(1) and s 52(4) of the <b>Motor Accidents Act</b>.  Section
43(1) provided:
<P>

<b>"43(1)	A claim must be made within 6 months after - </b>
<P>

<b>(a)	except as provided by paragraph (b), the date of the motor accident to
which the claim relates;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	if the claim is made in respect of the death of a person, the date of
death.</b>
<P>

5	The defendant has raised the plaintiff's non-compliance with s 43(1) of the
<b>Motor Accidents Act</b> in his defence.  The plaintiff referred me to
<b><u>Flower v Fitzgerald</u></b> (unreported, 6 December 1990) where Master
Malpass) stated at p 12:
<P>

	
<P>

<b>"No jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court, enabling it to deal with, a
failure to provide the requisite explanation.  There is
no prescribed
consequence upon failure to comply with s 43(2).  There appears to be no
sanction consequent upon breach.  In a practical
sense, in the event of breach
by a claimant, the Insurer may not be placed in a position where it is able to
resolve the claim..."</b>
<P>

6	According to Master Malpass a failure to provide the explanation (required by
s 43(2)) does not give rise to any bar to the bringing
of the an action
<P>

7	In <b><u>Nicholas v Webb (No 1)</u></b> (unreported, Master Greenwood, 8
April 1991) Master Greenwood held that an explanation for delay must be made to
the insurer in the
first instance.  If the insurer is not satisfied with the
explanation it can seek a stay of proceedings or seek to have the statement
of
claim struck out.  The defendant has not adopted either of these courses of
action.
<P>

8	Section 52(4) of the <b>Motor Accidents Act</b> provided:
<P>

	<b>"A claimant is not entitled to commence proceedings in respect of a claim
more than 3 years after the date on which the claim must
be made in accordance
with section 43 except with the leave of the court in which the proceedings are
to be taken."</b>
<P>

9	The authorities clearly establish that the onus is on an applicant for
extension of time to satisfy the court that it is just
and reasonable to extend
the time, or as it has often been expressed, that justice is best served if the
applicant be given leave
to proceed.  The starting point for 
<P>

examination of the way in which this discretion should be exercised is
<b><u>Salido v Nominal Defendant (1993)</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20NSWLR%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">32 NSWLR 524.</a>  At 532 Gleeson
CJ set out some principles to be considered in the exercise of the discretion.

<P>

10	The following guidelines are posited by the Chief Justice:
<P>

<b>"1.	Section 52(4) confers a discretion which is to be exercised judicially,
in a manner that furthers the purposes of the statutory
context in which it
appears.  The immediate purpose, as with any limitation period, is to protect
defendants against injustice of
stale claims; the statute is also aimed at
promoting forensic diligence.</b>
<P>

<b>2.	Bearing in mind those statutory purposes, the question is whether, in the
circumstances of each individual case, the applicant
for leave has demonstrated
that it is fair and just that leave should be granted.</b>
<P>

<b>3.	The diligence, or lack of diligence, shown by a plaintiff or a
plaintiff's legal representatives, in ascertaining and asserting
his or her
rights will ordinarily be a material factor, as will the extent of the relevant
delay, and the reason for it.</b>
<P>

<b>4.	The nature and extent of any forensic disadvantage to a defendant
resulting from the plaintiff's delay will also be material. 
The effect, if
any, of the delay upon the defendant's ability to defend an action is a matter
to be taken into account, and may in
some cases be of decisive
importance.</b>
<P>

<b>5.	Leave under s 52(4) may be refused if it would be plainly futile to grant
it, and in that connection an applicant's willingness
and ability to give a
full and satisfactory explanation of any delays in reporting to police,
notifying claims and commencing proceedings
will be material."</b>
<P>

11	The plaintiff says that he discharged the onus and established that it is
fair and reasonable to extend time in which the action
should be brought.  Or
to put it another way, the plaintiff has established that in all the
circumstances, justice is best served
by exercising discretion in favour of
him.  
<P>

12	In relation to the third guideline in <b><u>Salido</u></b>, the lack of
diligence shown by the plaintiff's representative is considered a material
factor.  Studdert J considered this issue
in <b><u>Guest v Southern &amp;
Anor</u></b> (unreported 22 September 1995).  <b><u>Guest</u></b> is an appeal
against the decision of Master Malpass that a full and satisfactory explanation
had been given for the purposes of s
52(3).  (This section is now s52(4)).  In
<b><u>Guest</u></b>, Studdert J held that the plaintiff was not personally
responsible for the delay and considered it to be reasonable for the plaintiff
to have relied upon his solicitors to the extent he did.  The plaintiff's
solicitors were essentially to blame for the delay.  Studdert
J held that this
was a very material consideration and referred to <b><u>Sophron v The Nominal
Defendant</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1957/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2096%20CLR%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 96 CLR 469</a> and<b><u> Stollznow v Calvert</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 749.</a>
<P>

13	In <b><u>Stollznow</u></b> the Court of Appeal entertained an appeal against
the decision of a trial judge who declined to order dismissal of proceedings

<P>

for want of prosecution.  It would seem that the inactivity complained of was
not inactivity for which the plaintiff was personally
to blame.  On the hearing
of the appeal Moffitt P, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said
at 753:
<P>

	<b>"As a matter of principle the blamelessness of a plaintiff personally for
the delay is a fact relevant to be considered, along with
other relevant facts.
The submission of the appellant to the contrary, namely, that the fault of the
respondent's solicitor should
be attributed vicariously to the respondent was
that, despite the absence of any personal fault she should be held to be to
blame
and the proceedings necessarily dismissed, should be rejected."</b>
<P>

14	It was in this context, that Studdert J said that the function of the
provision s 52(3) is to require the claimant to explain
that conduct in the
course of providing a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay.  It is
not to provide a weapon which may
enable an insurer to defeat the claim because
of such conduct.  It may be defeated if the court decides that the claimant has
failed
to provide a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in relation
to blame attributable to solicitors.
<P>

15	The plaintiff's current solicitor has no personal knowledge of the actions
that the previous solicitor took in relation to the
plaintiff's file.  He has
annexed correspondence and detailed his recent efforts in preparing the
plaintiff's case.  The former solicitor
who acted until 1995 is no longer with
the firm and has no independent recollection of the plaintiff or the steps he
took in relation
to the plaintiff's instructions.
<P>

16	
<P>

The plaintiff was not cross examined.  The plaintiff received advice from his
previous solicitor that he did not have a claim in
relation to the bus accident
at either Workers Compensation or Transcover.  He accepted that advice.  In
1990 he instructed his solicitor
Mr Pfennigwerth to act for him in respect of
any rights he may have in relation to compensation or damages arising out of
the bus
accident.  He did not pursue his certificate of earnings from his then
employer but his solicitor did not take any action to case
it up or request
that the plaintiff make further attempts to do so.
<P>

17	In 1994 he was advised that his accident did not fall within the Workers
Compensation Act.  From that the plaintiff assumed that
he was not entitled to
damages arising from the accident.  He thought that no further action was to be
taken and his claim was at
an end.  That being so when he changed his address,
he did not inform his solicitor of his new address.
<P>

18	It cannot be said that the previous solicitor conducted the plaintiff's
Motor Accidents Act claim with diligence.  It is true
that difficulties were
occasioned when the plaintiff's solicitor was obliged to submit a claim form in
accordance with s 44 and the
employer did not supply a certificate of earnings.
Studdert J refers to this problem in <b><u>Bridge v Kimmorley</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2014%20MVR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 14
MVR 245</a> at 251.  In 1993 the defendant's solicitor advised that he would accept
copies of tax returns for the years 1987 to date in lieu
of the certificate of
earnings.  These were finally supplied by the plaintiff's current solicitor on
11 June 1998.  I cannot 
<P>

attribute this delay to the plaintiff nor can I attribute the delay in properly
bringing these proceedings to the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff was reliant on the
advice of his solicitor and aside from not chasing up his certificate of
earnings, he has accepted and
followed his solicitor's advice.
<P>

19	In relation to guideline (5) liability although in dispute would not appear
to be complex as the plaintiff was a passenger travelling
on a bus when the
accident occurred.  A report of the accident was made to the police shortly
after the accident occurred.  The witnesses'
names have been recorded on the
P4.  The claim does not seem to be a large one however, I am satisfied that the
plaintiff's claim
is not futile.
<P>

20	In relation to guideline (4) in <b><u>Salido</u></b> the forensic
disadvantage is considered a material factor.  The defendant submitted that as
the plaintiff did not attend the medical
examination arranged in 1996 and has
now lost that opportunity to do so I take this into account.
<b><u>Salido</u></b> was decided before <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health
Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR 866.</a>  In <b><u>Taylor</u></b>, the
High Court was dealing with an application to extend time pursuant to s 31(2)
of the<b> Limitations of Actions Act Queensland</b><i> </i>1974 which is almost
identical with s 58(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a></b> in New South Wales.
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> deals with prejudice that occurs with delay.  These
principles enunciated in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> expand on what was said by the
Chief Justice in <b><u>Salido</u></b> and are applicable to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(4)</a>
applications  -  see <b><u>Hendricks v Agnew</u></b> (Court of Appeal,
unreported, 23 October 1997).
<P>

21	In <b><u>Taylor's</u></b> McHugh J case refers to the effect of delay on a
trial.  His Honour says:
<P>

	<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Second, it is
oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long
after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Third,
people
should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on the
basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>and;
<P>

<b>	"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period."</b>
<P>

22	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

	<b>"The applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant prejudice
to the prospective
defendant."</b>
<P>

23	I accept that the defendants would suffer the prejudice of the loss of the
statutory bar which they are now entitled.  The defendants
would also suffer
from the tyranny of time as witnesses memories fade.  As previously stated, a
report was made to the police shortly
after the accident and the plaintiff
attended Dr Aoeney's surgery 3 days after the accident.  A copy of the police
report and doctor's
report are now available.  The defendants have been served
with a statement of claim and an incomplete notice of claim form in 1990.
Medical reports have been served by the plaintiff.  In 1993 this statement of
claim was struck out and a second statement of claim
was filed in 1994.  While
there has been a gross delay in bringing this matter to a head and indifference
shown on behalf of the
plaintiff's prior solicitors, there is nothing before me
to suggest that the defendant would not have been aware that the claim was
still alive and being agitated.
<P>

24	Taking all of these circumstances into account, I have come to the
conclusion that in the exercise of my discretion in difficult
circumstances it
is appropriate to grant leave to the plaintiff to continue these proceedings.
If leave was granted, the defendant
consented to the plaintiff being allowed to
continue these proceedings.
<P>

25	The plaintiff consented to this matter being transferred to the District
Court, Sydney Registry.  As the plaintiff's solicitors
have largely been
responsible for the delay in these proceedings which brought about the
necessity of this motion, the plaintiff's
solicitors are to pay the defendant's
costs.
<P>

26	
<P>

The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Leave is granted to the plaintiff to continue these proceedings.
<P>

(2)	This matter is transferred to the District Court, Sydney Registry.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff's solicitors are to pay the defendant's costs.
