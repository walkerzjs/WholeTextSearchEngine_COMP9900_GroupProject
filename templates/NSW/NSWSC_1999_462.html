<P>

<b>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	The plaintiff, Hipolito Samper, who is called by the diminutive, "Paul"
brought this action against the first defendant, referred
to herein is
ASB-Tech, alleging negligence against ASB-Tech in that it failed to provide a
safe place or system or work and that
the plaintiff was directed to carry out
work in an area that was unsafe and to use a hose a platform likely to become
slippery and
that ASB-Tech breached the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1993
in that it failed to instruct the plaintiff as to a safe means
of carrying out
the work and failed to provide a safe floor on which the plaintiff was to carry
out its work.
<P>

2	ASB-Tech is a company in liquidation in respect of which at the commencement
of the hearing, I granted leave for the matter to
proceed, pursuant to s.471B
of the Corporations Law. 
<P>

3	The second defendant herein referred to as "Pacific Power" was (at the time
of the relevant events) in the course of de-commissioning
Wangi Power Station,
employed ASB-Tech to carry out work for the demolition and removal of asbestos
from the power station. 
<P>

4	The plaintiff alleged that Pacific Power was  negligent in that it failed to
provide a safe place and system of work and directed
the plaintiff to work in
an area that was unsafe, requiring the plaintiff to use a hose on a platform
likely to become slippery.
The plaintiff further alleged that Pacific Power
failed to provide a safe means of access and egress under the Occupational
Health
and Safety Act (1983) and failed to instruct the plaintiff in the
carrying out of the safe means of his work and breached its duty
of care to the
plaintiff in that it failed to provide barriers as required by the Construction
Safety Regulations 1912.
<P>

5	The defendants both denied negligence and both alleged contributory
negligence by the plaintiff. ASB-Tech also alleged that the
plaintiff's ability
to lead a normal life has not been significantly impaired by the injuries
alleged pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.151G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act 1987</a>. ASB-Tech also
alleged that the plaintiff has not sustained injury in terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.151H</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act 1987</a>, and that the plaintiff has made false statements
and pleadings to induce ASB-Tech to make payments of compensation and claim
damages.
<P>

6	The allegations of fraud were that he had endeavoured to induce a witness to
provide false evidence as to where he was injured
in that the plaintiff was not
working where he was directed to work and that the plaintiff was at the time
endeavouring to steal
from Pacific Power and was not acting in the course of
his employment from ASB-Tech. 
<P>

7	Each defendant brought cross-actions seeking contribution for indemnity from
the other. Pacific Power has additionally claimed
indemnity pursuant to an
agreement between ASB-Tech and itself.
<P>

8	The plaintiff who was born on 15 November 1949 and is now aged 49 came to
Australia from Spain in 1974 and on 11 October 1994
commenced work with
ASB-Tech as a rigger. The plaintiff was married with no children. He worked for
various companies as a rigger
before commencing employment with ASB-Tech. 
<P>

9	The plaintiff's duties at ASB-Tech involved general labouring activities as
rigging. Checking and maintaining and cleaning various
areas and sometimes
driving a crane. As part of the plaintiff's duties he was concerned with the
removal of asbestos and cleansing
of the shower room used by the asbestos
workers. Part of his duties also involved sealing the holes in various parts of
the plants
with adhesive paint, to protect workers on the plant being exposed
to asbestos dust.
<P>

10	At about 6.30 in the morning on 15 July 1995 the plaintiff had been cleaning
the Wangi site using a hose, broom and mop. There
is normally no work on a
Saturday there being only a small number of employees, present perhaps 10 or
12. The area where the plaintiff
had been cleaning was on the top of three
levels of the premises. The level below that being a series of platforms in the
nature
of a mezzanine floor approximately 4 metres from the ground floor.
<P>

11	The plaintiff's evidence was that he had come down the stairs from the
shower level to the area where he contended that he had
fallen. He said he came
down the stairs which are steel mesh stairs and that he walked along the lowest
level and then ascended the
vertical set of stairs to the top of the platform
which is the mezzanine level referred to from which he says he fell. The
plaintiff
said that he did work on top of the mezzanine platform cleaning the
floor as a lot of water came into the boiler room. He said that
the floor,
which is the mezzanine level was very wet and that he was cleaning it with a
broom. The surface was a concrete smooth
surface with no lip or rim around it,
there being a wall at the back of the platform. His evidence was that he put
down all his gear
on the lowest level and climbed back up the ladder to tape
holes in the wall at the rear of the platform where cables and pipes had
been
taken out. He said he taped around the holes. 
<P>

12	The plaintiff's evidence was that he was facing the direction of the
vertical ladder standing on the mezzanine platform and that
he put his foot
forward and slipped and fell face down to the ground level below. Adjoining the
steps facing the direction the plaintiff
was facing was a steel beam which
appears from the photographic evidence to be only a very short distance from
the ladder and does
not appear wide enough for the plaintiff to fall between
the ladder and the beam. He said he did not touch the ladder and tried to
reach
the beam but went straight to the ground head first hitting his face on his
arms which he had crossed in front of his forehead.
He said he was wearing
joggers with steel caps at the front specially made for the task he was
undertaking. The plaintiff said that
he had told an officer of Pacific Power
that there was water continually on the area on which he had worked and that
the problem
had not been fixed.             
<P>

13	The plaintiff's evidence was that he tried to get up from the concrete floor
and that he was in terrible pain and could see bones
protruding from his arms
and a number of teeth had been dislodged. He then walked to the staircase from
which he had originally descended
before mounting the platform and was
discovered there by two other workers who had heard a noise, a Mr Simon Curtis
and Mr David
Vane. Curtis and Vane called an ambulance and the plaintiff was
taken to the John Hunter Hospital. The plaintiff was unable to use
his arms and
his jaw was broken and teeth dislodged.
<P>

14	The plaintiff was at that stage in a de-facto relationship with a Mrs Smith
with whom he continued to live at the time of this
hearing, although the
parties had by then separated but under the same roof.
<P>

15	There was tendered in evidence a compensation claim form which the plaintiff
said was completed by his de-facto wife's brother,
Mr Darryl Geatches, the form
having being given to Geatches. The plaintiff's evidence was that Geatches
filled out the form and that
the plaintiff had not given him information for
that purpose saying that he was outside while Geatches filled out the form. He
said
that David Vane, being one of three Vanes working for ASB-Tech had
discovered the plaintiff on the staircase. He said that the plaintiff
had great
difficulty talking and that he did not give Vane or anyone else a description
of the accident that he had slipped from
a rung of the ladder as alleged in the
form. There was also admitted in evidence a Workcover Authority medical
certificate which
the plaintiff alleged was filled out by his de-facto wife,
although he had signed the document. The certificate which was completed
some
nine days later on 24 July stated that the plaintiff had slipped from the first
floor to the ground because the floor was wet
and slippery.
<P>

16	In cross-examination the plaintiff said that he was not able to talk to
anyone and the first word he said to anyone after the
accident was in the
hospital after the operation which he had performed on him, which was a couple
of days later. The plaintiff then
said that he didn't remember talking to
anyone and that he had never seen anyone from work. He said David Vane had seen
him a couple
of days after the operation and denied that Vane had seen him on
the day of the accident at the hospital. The hospital notes which
were
exhibited in the proceedings confirmed the plaintiff's oral evidence that he
had had a coffee and a biscuit that morning about
6.00 am. When asked about
whether he was allergic the plaintiff as noted in the hospital records said
that maybe he had said to the
nurses that he was. 
<P>

17	When cross-examined as to whether the plaintiff had a conversation with the
ambulance officer he said he couldn't remember whether
he had talked to the
ambulance man but he said that he didn't talk to the ambulance man in the way
that it had been suggested. He
then later said at p.49 of the transcript;
<P>

	"A. Never told the ambulance man nothing. Maybe the boys who took me to the
ambulance man. I never talk to the ambulance man."
<P>

18	When the plaintiff was asked as to whether he had discussed the accident
with David Vane he said that he and Vane were never
good together and that he
had not discussed the accident. The plaintiff alleged that he had always had
trouble with Vane. The plaintiff
admitted that Vane had visited him in the
hospital but denied that there had been any conversation with Vane. The
plaintiff said
that he thought it was the second or third day after the
accident but that the plaintiff's de-facto wife was with the plaintiff at
all
times. It was put to the plaintiff by Mr Williams Q.C. for ASB-Tech that David
Vane had been asked by the plaintiff on the night
of the accident whether Vane
could locate him at another location. This was denied by the plaintiff. 
<P>

19	When cross-examined about his capacity to read, in relation to the signing
of the claim form the plaintiff denied that he could
read although subsequently
admitted to signing an application form for other employment and then gave
evidence that he understood
some words. In relation to the claim form he
alleged that his brother-in-law had read it to him and he had signed but that
he had
never seen the contents of the form. He denied giving anyone a version
of how the injury had occurred but in the proceedings gave
no explanation other
than that his brother-in-law had filled in the form but at no stage did anyone
give any credible explanation,
on behalf of the plaintiff as to how the version
which came to be in the claim form had been written.
<P>

20	In relation to the carrying out of his duties, the plaintiff said it was to
Darryl Vane to whom he was answerable as the person
in charge of him employed
by ASB-Tech and that Darryl Vane and he had, very good relations. The plaintiff
contended that he had seen
Darryl Vane hand his brother-in-law the form which
his brother-in-law had asked the plaintiff to sign.
<P>

21	The plaintiff called Geatches to give evidence, Geatches being the
plaintiff's de-facto brother, who provided the plaintiff's
house which was
owned by a company controlled by Geatches. Geatches evidence was that he had
copied the details of the accident report
onto the claim form and had asked the
plaintiff to sign it. The form which is dated 3 August 1995 stated "foot
slipped on wet rung
of ladder causing fall to concrete floor. 3m below."
Geatches gave evidence as to his experience in the mining industry and his
misunderstanding
of the importance of claim forms. He said that he had spoken
to the plaintiff about the circumstances of the accident he said "briefly
once." Geatches evidence was at transcript p. 69;
<P>

	"A. He had to do some inspections, he climbed up some ladders, spun around,
feet went from under me and slipped and fell."
<P>

22	Geatches said that this was the version that the plaintiff had given in
hospital. Geatches admitted that there was no version
given to him of the
plaintiff's foot slipping on the rung of a ladder. Geatches said that in
hindsight he should have read to the
plaintiff the version of the accident he
had written down and asked the plaintiff if he had agreed with it. 
<P>

23	The plaintiff's former de-facto wife then gave evidence of her attending the
hospital on 15 July 1995 and saw the plaintiff before
he underwent any
operation. She was attended by her 34 year old daughter. Mrs Smith said that
the handwriting on the claim form which
is exhibit F was in her own handwriting
and that she had obtained the information from the plaintiff. She said that the
information
was provided to her at about 3.00 pm on the day of the accident.
She said that David Vane and his wife had visited the hospital that
afternoon
but denied that there was any conversation between the plaintiff and David
Vane. Mrs Smith then gave evidence about the
work that she carried out for the
plaintiff after he returned home from his injuries and the notebook which she
had used to record
the work which she did including diving him to the doctors.
She said that her daughter had helped her in relation to the keeping
of the
records. She gave evidence as to the limitations in the use of the plaintiff's
arm. Mrs Smith said that when Mr Vane and his
wife were with the plaintiff in
the hospital on either the Saturday of the injury or the following day she said
that the plaintiff
didn't talk very much because he couldn't and that she could
understand him only vaguely because of the silver paper in his mouth.

<P>

24	The plaintiff called as a witness the said David Vane who described finding
the plaintiff on the stairs earlier described, that
he was in a bloody state
with blood on his mouth and one arm was bent and twisted. David Vane said that
it was about 15-20 minutes
from the photograph exhibited in the proceedings
where the plaintiff alleged that he had fallen. Vane said that the plaintiff
said,
<P>

	"Well put me at the bottom of the stairs"
<P>

	He said the plaintiff said to him;
<P>

	"I fell on the bottom of these stairs but that is not where I actually
fell"
<P>

25	The plaintiff indicated the stairs from the mezzanine level. David Vane said
that he had difficulty in understanding the plaintiff.
<P>

26	David Vane said that he and his wife had visited the plaintiff on the
Saturday afternoon after Vane had finished his work and
that he had gone with a
balloon and some flowers. David Vane said that the plaintiff had asked vain
whether he had seen some pipe
cutters and that he had looked around and found
them on a mezzanine floor but that that mezzanine floor was similar to that
referred
to by the plaintiff but was further back up the building. David Vane
identified a photograph of the pipe cutters that he had located
and discovered
on the mezzanine level, that he had described some lengths of copper pipe that
looked as though they had been freshly
cut. David Vane's evidence was that the
plaintiff had no duties to perform on the mezzanine floor on the Saturday. He
said that his
first cousin Darryl Vane was working in the office and was the
manager in charge. David Vane said that later he had had a conversation
with
the plaintiff and that the plaintiff said he had been cutting some piping on
the mezzanine level which he called "the dummy
roof" and that he was reaching
above his head at the time and fell onto the basement floor. David Vane said he
had told Darryl Vane
of what he had actually discovered but conceded that the
claims forms had been filled out identifying what David Vane understood
to be
the wrong dummy roof. David Vane's explanation was that he thought the
plaintiff would have been sacked on the spot for what
the plaintiff was doing.
David Vane said that he had gone back to the floor and cleaned up the fresh
blood so that there would be
no evidence of where the plaintiff had said he had
actually fallen. In cross-examination David Vane said the plaintiff has said to
him;
<P>

	"Tell them I fell on the stairwell of the dummy roof on boiler 4"
<P>

27	David Vain said that the plaintiff was mumbling or muttering. He said the
area the plaintiff alleged to have fallen was not the
location where David Vane
had found the pipes nor cleaned up the blood. 
<P>

28	David Vane admitted that he had told Darryl Vane that what the plaintiff had
told him was a lie. David Vane said there had not
been enmity between the
plaintiff and himself, as alleged by the plaintiff but in fact they had worked
together for twelve months
and had been out some times to a club with their
respective wives. David Vane then recollected that he had found the pipe
cutters
on the basement or ground floor and the copper pipes on the mezzanine
roof but at the other location further away, not at the location
alleged in the
plaintiff's evidence before this court. His evidence further was that he
thought the plaintiff was the safety officer
at the time of the injury. There
was then admitted in evidence two statements by David Vane, the first of which
gave one version
of the events and the second in accordance with the evidence
which he had given in court. Mr Royle for the second defendant called
a Mr
Peter Dedman who at the time had been the relevant time had been the
engineering officer for Pacific Power. His evidence was
that ASB-Tech had a
safety officer. Mr Dedman had arrived at the site shortly after the plaintiff
was injured and took photographs
of what he understood to be the accident site.
Those photographs were exhibited in the hearing. His evidence was, as evidenced
by
the photographs, that the condition of the mezzanine floor on which the
plaintiff alleged he was working had no evidence of any water
nor is there any
evidence in the photographs that were exhibited in the proceedings. There is
evidence that there was water on the
basement or ground floor. His evidence was
that he had taken the photographs at about 10.48 am less than half an hour
after the injury
and that he could see no blood at the site of the bottom of
the vertical stairs other than on the plaintiff.
<P>

	<b>Analysis of the Evidence</b>
<P>

29	The manner in which the plaintiff gave his evidence both as to the court's
observation of him and the way in which he actually
worded answers to questions
demonstrated a determination on the part of the plaintiff to undermine damaging
evidence which he clearly
anticipated from David Vane. The allegation of bad
faith between them contended by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's claim that
the
plaintiff was unable to talk adequately to David Vane, on the day of the
accident because of his injuries were unconvincing. David
Vane gave his
evidence in a forthright manner and appeared to be giving an accurate version
of the events which he described in his
evidence as to conversations and as to
what he found and saw.
<P>

30	I find that the conversation generally as given in evidence by David Vane
occurred with the plaintiff both at the hospital and
at the subsequent occasion
when the accident was discussed. The finding of the pipe cutters and the copper
pipe I accept and draw
the inference that this had something to do with the
plaintiff's activities. I accept David Vane's evidence that the first version
given by him in the statement exhibited before me was given with a view to
assisting the plaintiff in some way so that the plaintiff
would not lose his
job, but that the second version in fact constituted the facts as actually
occurred, which coincided with Vane's
oral evidence.
<P>

31	I find that the version given by the plaintiff is an improbable version of
how he came to be injured. The information provided
to the hospital and the
ambulance officers could only have been provided by the plaintiff. He was the
only one with the information
as to what he had consumed that morning. Clearly
he was able to carry on some form of limited conversation. There has not been a
version provided as to the completion of the form which contends that he
slipped on a rung when ascending the vertical ladder to
the mezzanine platform.
The fact is he did sign the form,  however limited his knowledge of English and
the version of him slipping
from the ladder further undermines the credibility
of the version that he gave in his evidence before the court.
<P>

32	The evidence of Mrs Smith and her brother were both carefully tailored to
fit in with the version of the plaintiff in his oral
evidence and I do not
accept their evidence where it conflicts with David Vane. I do not accept Mrs
Smith's evidence as to the fact
that there was no conversation with David Vane
at the hospital and that she was with the plaintiff the whole time and that he
could
not have discussed the matter with anybody on the day that the injury
occurred. I accept the evidence that the plaintiff was in fact
carrying out
activities inconsistent with his employment at a different location to where he
was obliged to carry out his duties,
and outside the scope of his
employment.
<P>

33	The evidence given by the plaintiff as I have referred to above, in
enumerating the facts show a number of variations when pressed
in
cross-examination, as to what conversations he had on the day. If I were to
accept the plaintiff's version as to his inability
to communicate it is
incomprehensible as to how the hospital records in evidence could have shown
the information that clearly came
from the plaintiff. The whole of his evidence
concerning the conversations which he said did not take place conflict with
several
occasions when he admitted that the may have been able to express some
words. I find that the evidence given by the plaintiff as
to the location of
his injuries and the way in which he slipped did not occur as alleged by him
and I do not accept his oral evidence
and in that respect I accept the evidence
particularly of that of David Vane and also Peter Dedman called by Pacific
Power. The photographic
evidence taken so soon after the alleged events in the
version put forward to this court, by the plaintiff, are in conflict with
his
evidence as to water being located in the area where he alleges he slipped. 
<P>

	<b>The cause of action against ASB-Tech</b>
<P>

34	I find for the reasons set out above that ASB-Tech was not guilty of
negligence, that the injuries alleged did not arise out
of any breach of duty
on behalf of that company and I find that the plaintiff was not acting in the
course of his employment when
injured.
<P>

	<b>The Cause of Action against Pacific Power</b>
<P>

35	On the evidence given by Mr Dedman and the evidence of David Vane, I find
that the plaintiff was not under the supervision of
Pacific Power and that it
was ASB-Tech for whom he was carrying out his duties. In any event I find that
the injuries sustained by
the plaintiff were as a result of his own actions in
working at another place than his duties with ASB-Tech required him to work,
and that he was not carrying out duties on behalf of ASB-Tech required by
Pacific Power. I therefore find that Pacific Power was
not guilty of negligence
as alleged.
<P>

	<b>The Cross Actions</b>
<P>

36	As I have found negligence as against neither ASB-Tech nor Pacific Power
there is no basis for the making of any proportionment
of liability or
indemnity. I therefore find in the case of each cross-action that the
cross-claimant has failed to establish any
basis for apportionment or indemnity
against the other.
<P>

	<b>Verdict </b>
<P>

37	I enter a verdict in favour of ASB-Tech on the plaintiff's action against it
and against Pacific Power on the cross-action brought
by Pacific Power against
ASB-Tech. 
<P>

38	I give a verdict in favour of Pacific Power in the action by the plaintiff
and in the cross-action brought against it by ASB-Tech.
<P>

	<b>Damages</b>
<P>

39	It is appropriate both in terms of the agreement that had been made by
counsel and in the areas not agreed that I make findings
in respect of the
damages claim brought by the plaintiff, granting leave to the parties to
re-list the matter in the event of there
being any further issues as to damages
to be resolved or in the event of any verdict being substituted for the
verdicts found by
me on the issues of liability.
<P>

40	On the medical evidence admitted before the court the plaintiff sustained
very severe injuries and considerable pain and suffering
as a result of the
fall which he obviously had, wherever that fall may have occurred on the
subject premises. The plaintiff suffered
a perilunate dislocation of the right
wrist with associated injury to the median nerve, a lunate dislocation of the
left wrist and
also a compound fracture of the left distal humerus which was
significantly comminuted and intra-articular in nature. The plaintiff
also had
a number of loose teeth and a fracture of his maxilla. The plaintiff suffered
very considerable pain at the time of his
injuries and as a result of the
medical procedures and subsequent treatment and rehabilitation measures that
were effected. 
<P>

41	The plaintiff spent a considerable period of time in John Hunter Hospital
not only because of the operations which were performed
on his broken bones but
also because of the problems which he had with his personal hygiene.  The
plaintiff demonstrated problems
with range of movement of his elbows and showed
evidence of rotator cuff restrictions because of pain. The plaintiff suffered
from
sensory changes in the median nerve on his right arm. 
<P>

42	The plaintiff suffered a lengthy period of considerable disability. As a
result of subsequent treatment the plaintiff had a successful
uniting of the
distal left humerus, a restriction in the range of movement of his left elbow
and has some minor irritation of the
ulner nerve. The plaintiff underwent
further surgery on his right wrist to explore the median nerve and a limited
arthrodesis was
performed after excising the scaphoid bone in his wrist. The
plaintiff has since been diagnosed as developing a degree of reflex
sympathetic
dystrophy and has a marked stiffness of right hand and fingers together with
significant pain. The pain continues, and
will continue to need analgesics and
may require further surgery. He has been left with a significant impairment of
his upper right
arm and a permanent impairment of his left arm. The plaintiff's
left elbow injury considerably resolved and he now has a functional
range of
movement. His left hand still shows some symptoms but nerve studies appear to
be normal for the left hand. The evidence
of Dr Mitchell in his report of 6
October 1998 expresses the opinion that a wrist arthrodesis may become
necessary to his right wrist.

<P>

43	The plaintiff had an orthopaedic examination of his capacity after the
injuries he had sustained. The unchallenged evidence is
that he has had a 45%
permanent percentage loss of efficient use of his right arm and it is unlikely
that he will be able to return
to any form of employment in the rigging
industry. This means that his general future employment prospects remain very
limited particularly
because of his low educational skills and his limitation
on use of English.
<P>

44	The plaintiff has difficulty carrying out basic household tasks and matters
such as cooking, gardening and dressing represent
problems for him. He alleges
pain at the slightest touch of his left elbow and the use of his arms. It is
very difficult to assess
the extent of pain that the plaintiff suffers
particularly as this level of pain was not substantially challenged. The
evidence of
the plaintiff as to his injuries suggest very strongly a degree of
exaggeration of symptoms and the medical evidence tends to support
this.
Nevertheless the plaintiff does suffer substantial restrictions in his use of
his upper limbs and will continue to suffer loss
of amenity of life and the
probability that he will be unable to meaningful rejoin the workforce.
<P>

45	The plaintiff presents as a very sad man, whether he be exaggerating his
symptoms nevertheless he is clearly suffering considerable
pain and restriction
on his everyday activities and his enjoyment of life. I consider the plaintiff
has received a serious injury
in terms of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act 1987</a> and
that his accumulated injury is 40% of the maximum which may be awarded against
ASB-Tech. The amount under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a> at the relevant time is
$217,600.00. 
<P>

46	As against the second defendant I would assess general damages at
$125,000.00. 
<P>

47	The parties have agreed on average weekly earnings at $600.00 and have
calculated past wage loss to the date of hearing at $104,000.00
which I allow.
I also allow an appropriate the sum of $18,000.00 for the 30 weeks from date of
hearing. 
<P>

48	The parties have agreed for an Fox v Woods allowance of $11,737.00 to which
I allow and to which I allow such further sum may
be appropriate to the
adjustment I have made to the past wage loss. I grant leave to the parties to
re-list the matter if they are
unable to agree on the calculation of that sum.

<P>

49	In terms of future wage loss I allow a period of 15.5 years on the  5%
discount tables as against the first defendant, and the
multiplier is therefore
567. As against the second defendant I allow economic loss for a period of 15.5
years on the 3% tables, the
appropriate multiplier being 644. 
<P>

50	The parties have agreed on loss of part out-of-pocket expenses as at date of
hearing at $43,871.36. I allow that sum together
with additional out-of-pockets
that may have been incurred since the hearing.
<P>

51	The parties have agreed on out-of-pocket expenses including visits to G.P's
at $10.00 per week, which I allow on a life expectancy
of 34 years as against
the first defendant on the 5% discount tables being the multiplier of 865.09
and as against the second defendant
on the 3% discount tables being the
multiplier  of 1119.01. 
<P>

52	The parties have agreed on an hourly rate for the services of the
plaintiff's then de-facto wife. As at date of hearing there
was a claim of 1060
hours at a rate agreed between the parties of $12.50. That is the same rate
agreed in futuro. Clearly for a considerable
period the plaintiff was unable to
look after himself and required some assistance. I considered he and Mrs Smith
have exaggerated
the extent of assistance provided in the past and now
necessary. The evidence which was given as to the way the hours were calculated
and recorded shows some degree of exaggeration on the part of Mrs Smith. I
think it appropriate to date of hearing I allow one half
of the total past
claim namely, 530 hours at $12.50. Since that time I consider that although the
plaintiff is unable to be part
of the workforce that the extent to which he now
needs assistance other than what would normally be provided to him is of the
order
of one hour per day and I therefore allow additionally to that which was
agreed for past claims at the date of hearing a further
208 hours. The future
allowance for services at 1 hour per day will continue for the 34 year life
expectancy of the plaintiff.
<P>

53	The parties have sought that costs be deferred for further argument.
<P>

	<b>Orders</b>
<P>

54	The orders that I therefore make are as follows;
<P>

	1. Verdict for the first defendant against the plaintiff.
<P>

	2. Verdict for the second defendant against the plaintiff.
<P>

	3. Verdict for each cross-defendant on the cross-claim brought against each
cross-defendant.
<P>

	4. Liberty is reserved to apply in respect of matters of damages requiring
further argument or calculation.
<P>

	5. Costs reserved.
<P>
