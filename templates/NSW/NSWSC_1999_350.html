<b>20642/96  -  TIMOTHY ANDREW McDONALD by his next friend LYNNELL HOGAN   v
STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR :     Timothy Andrew McDonald was born on 30 March 1962, the
youngest of four siblings.  He is developmentally delayed
to a marked degree.
The exact cause of this has not been determined but his disability is profound.
He has never crawled or walked.
 For a few months he demonstrated a capacity to
roll over but he stopped doing this and is substantially incapable of
independent
movement.  He can wave his arms and elevate from the supine to an
extent.  At the age of two or three he is reported to have had
a few words at
his disposal but these have been lost and he is limited to non verbal sound
making.  Those close to him regard his
eyes as expressive and they recognize
moods in him such as joy, fear, upset and the like.  He has always been and
will remain totally
dependent on others for every activity of living.
<P>

2	Until he reached the age of 27, the plaintiff was cared for in his home at
Goulburn principally by his mother with some assistance
from other family
members.  His mother, Mrs McDonald is now aged 67 years.  She was widowed when
Timothy was 16.  Mrs McDonald's
own health has not been robust in recent years.
She is diabetic and has been told apparently, that she has osteoporosis.  She
has
had major surgery to her spine, the last procedure taking place in about
mid 1988.  
<P>

3	It came to pass that the plaintiff attended on a day basis at Strathallen
Centre, a facility conducted originally by the Department
of Health and taken
over by the Department of Family and Community Services ( as it was then
known).  By gazettal on 30 June 1989
Strathallen Centre and other similar
developmental disability centres were removed from the list of hospitals in the
5th Schedule
to the Public Hospitals Act, that removal taking effect on 1 July
1989.  I shall return to this matter.  When Mrs McDonald was required
to go to
Sydney for surgery in 1988, she agreed to the plaintiff entering Strathallen
for full time residential care, a decision
which she testified that she made
with reluctance:
<P>

	"Q.	Some time in 1988 he went into full time residential care?
<P>

	 A.	Yes.
<P>

	 Q.	And did could you tell us how you felt in terms of whether you experienced
any guilt about that, or whether you did not?
<P>

	 A.	I think every mother of a handicapped person has this feeling of guilt.  I
wanted to be able to look after Timothy all my life
and me being the only one
to do it."
<P>

4	However, in the light of experience Mrs McDonald came to terms with the
situation.  She gave this further evidence:
<P>

	"Q.	And you told us that you were satisfied with the service, had you made
some assessment or judgment about it in coming to that
conclusion?
<P>

	 A.	At that time when I really put Timothy there, they had cottages out at
Strathallen, and I fought like for them to be separated
from the psychiatric
for the developmentally delayed, and when these cottages were built I thought
it was the answer to my prayers.
 I thought they were wonderful.  They were
lovely cottages and nice sized rooms."
<P>

5	Timothy was accommodated in a cottage designated as No 5.  He was allocated
his own room and he shared the house with four other
residents.  By day he
spent time reclined in either a bean bag or a chair in the living area.  Staff
attended to all his needs which
of course included bathing, dressing and
feeding him.  He is incontinent and his lower torso was enclosed in a large
napkin-like
garment with urine pads placed within it.
<P>

6	Family members, prominently his mother and his sister Mrs Hogan spent
extensive time with him.  On occasions, usually in liaison
with the welfare
officer Mr Livermore, Timothy would spend a day at home.  Towards the end of
1989 Mrs McDonald observed that her
son appeared to be disturbed.  Of course,
he could not communicate his feelings by words but she thought he was withdrawn
and that
the noises he made were not in accord with normalcy and she noticed
him, unusually, clinging to his brother.  She consulted Mr Livermore
who
arranged for medical examinations but although these were undertaken the
medical examiners did not detect any injury or anything
that could be diagnosed
as different from or super-added to his usual condition.
<P>

7	It has been common ground in the litigation (despite the formal declining to
admit matters by the Amended Defence) that an employee
at Strathallen Centre
Vicki Adams, a registered nurse, committed a series of assaults upon the
plaintiff whilst he was in residence
at cottage No 5.  I should specify that
Sister Adams has not been called to give evidence by either side and
accordingly she has
had no opportunity to give any account of her conduct or
offer any explanation she might wish to make.  Other employees of Strathallen
have given evidence about what they saw her do and there have been tendered
records of investigation and enquiry together with statements
taken in
connection with them.  As well the evidence includes departmental minutes,
memoranda, file notes and depositions taken at
Goulburn Local Court when Sister
Adams was prosecuted on charges of assault.  A series of relevant certificates
of conviction was
also tendered.  
<P>

8	For the purposes of this litigation therefore and from that material I find
that Sister Adams committed assaults upon the plaintiff.
 There are 12
certificates of conviction each specifying an offence of assault upon Timothy
McDonald without particulars and notifying
that in respect of each charge
Sister Adams was released after conviction upon her entry into a recognizance
in the sum of $300 without
surety to be of good behaviour for three years
pursuant to s 558 of the Crimes Act.  As I have said, the certificates in their
terms
do not discriminate the various acts which constituted the individual
assaults.  I am satisfied that those acts included inhibiting
the plaintiff's
breathing through nasal passages by placing a peg on his nose and by holding
his nose between fingers; taping his
mouth with micropore; pulling his head by
the hair; splashing cold water on him while he was in a bath of warm water;
putting a urine
soaked incontinence pad on his face and stamping on his hands
and feet.  The evidence does not enable me to find precisely when any
particular assault took place.  I do not ignore the observations by Mrs
McDonald which led to her request for medical examination
in the latter half of
1989 but application of the standard of proof leads me to the conclusion that
probably the assaults were committed
between November 1989 and mid January 1990
at which latter time Sister Adams was removed from duty in the Strathallen
cottages. 

<P>

9	These assaults were witnessed by other members of staff who were junior in
status to Sister Adams.  I accept their further evidence
that she made
reference to the plaintiff from time to time in insulting terms such as
referring to him as "an abortion gone wrong".
 I reject however the invitation
of counsel for the plaintiff to find that there were probable assaults
committed by Sister Adams
when others were not there to observe.  The argument
advanced was broadly based upon the proposition that Sister Adams were rostered
from time to time on night duty.  On such occasions two staff supervised five
cottages and worked independently save for times when
they might require the
assistance of each other for a particular task such as lifting a
patient/resident.  At the time of Mrs McDonald's
observation of change in her
son paralleling the time of the now known assaults and subsequently, Mrs
McDonald's observations included
manifestations by the plaintiff of what might
be called night terrors.  Therefore, it was contended that it was more likely
than
not that the plaintiff had been the victim of other assaults at times when
Sister Adams was alone at night and unobserved, given
her apparent contempt for
him and her propensity to commit assaults upon him.  I am unwilling to draw an
inference of the probable
occurrence of assault or assaults from the
circumstances demonstrated by the evidence other than those testified to by the
witnesses.
<P>

10	Upon being informed of Mrs McDonald's concerns about her observations of
change in her son's demeanour, Mr Livermore had arranged
for medical
examinations which detected no sign of injury on the body.  The misconduct of
Sister Adams came to the attention of management
at Strathallen as a result of
information provided by a Sister Kennedy, a staff member who reported to Mr
Aubrey a nursing unit manager
who in turn informed the Mr Boyle the Director of
Nursing.  This chain of information passing occurred approximately 15 to 17
January
1990.  There is evidence to suggest that some complaint about Sister
Adams' conduct had earlier been passed to Mr Mills (a senior
charge nurse) on
about 10 January but his response was to indicate that he would not do anything
unless he was given written confirmation
of complaint.  His position was
immediately above that of Sister Adams being senior and junior charge nurses
respectively.  They
were described as friends and were said to socialize
outside of the work environment.  I consider it would be entirely prudent to
require any complaint about serious misconduct to be submitted in  writing.
The possible reaction to such complaint is suspension
of an employee and
ultimate dismissal and it would be a quite unreasonable administration which
risked the complainant varying, ameliorating
or even denying the substance of
oral communication upon which action had been taken.  The tone of submissions
on behalf of the plaintiff
was that there was something sinister about Mr
Mills' reaction but I do not find it a matter for criticism.
<P>

11	A letter dated 24 January 1990 was sent by Mr Boyle to Sister Adams (Exhibit
3) and it referred to an earlier communication of
19 January in which charges
under the Public Sector Management Act were notified.  Sister Adams never
thereafter returned to work
at Strathallen.  A preliminary enquiry was directed
to be undertaken by Mr Smith the Deputy Director of Nursing by the terms of an
Instrument dated 1 February 1990.  On 7 February 1990 Mr Smith reported
(Exhibit N) recommending pursuit of some of the charges already
notified
together with some additional charges.  He made a recommendation to extend the
"time frame" of charges to span from 1 August
1989 to 10 January 1990 but this
does not cause me to depart from my finding on the evidence that the relevant
assaults probably
took place no earlier than November 1989.  After an ensuing
formal interview the delegate of the Director General recommended on
18 June
1990 that Sister Adams be dismissed from the Public Service.  On 22 June 1990
Sister Adams sent by facsimile transmission
a letter of resignation expressed
to take effect from that day (Exhibit DD).  On 27 June 1990 approval was given
to its acceptance
on those terms (Exhibit CC).  
<P>

12	On 26 January 1990 Mr Boyle and Mr Livermore had called on Mrs McDonald.
The detail of what was conveyed on this occasion is
not clear and there is some
dispute, however it is plain that Mrs McDonald was informed that it was alleged
that Timothy had been
assaulted by a staff nurse.  I am satisfied that the
officers declined to nominate the nurse at that stage but that they informed
Mrs McDonald that an investigation was taking place and that more information
would be forthcoming when it had been finalized.  I
do not doubt that Mrs
McDonald was shocked by this news and she became distressed at not being privy
to the detail of the allegations
immediately.  Thereafter she aggressively
pursued whatever avenues occurred to her to gain further information.  Mrs
McDonald complained
that from the interview on 26 January she gained the
impression that the number of charges was limited to two and that it was only
much later (in August) that she learned of the larger number.  I am not
satisfied that anyone sought to deceive her but I am satisfied
that the
departmental employees restricted her access to information until the
procedures under the Public Sector Management Act
were completed.  I do not
find that such restriction was improper.  
<P>

13	On 31 July 1990 the Department of Family and Community Services wrote to Mrs
McDonald in these terms (Exhibit Q):
<P>

	"I am writing to inform you of the course of events since my previous letter
of 12 March 1990.  At that time a preliminary inquiry
that had been instituted
under the disciplinary provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/psma1988235/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Sector Management Act 1988</a> was
in train.
<P>

	Following consideration of the report of the preliminary inquiry I issued a
letter of charge to Sister Adams regarding nine alleged
breaches of discipline
relating to her care of clients, including your son Timothy, at the
"Strathallen" Centre.  Sister Adams formally
responded to the charges on 2 May
1990, denying all the allegations and requesting an interview with an officer
nominated by me,
as was her right under the Act.
<P>

	Sister Adams was interviewed on 4 June 1990 in the presence of an officer of
the Nurses Association by Mr David Sherlock, Director
of Operations (Disability
Services).  Mr Sherlock subsequently recommended that Sister Adams be dismissed
from the Public Service.
 This recommendation was approved by the Deputy
Director General (Mr Marchant) on 20 June 1990.
<P>

	Prior to the service on Sister Adams of this decision she submitted her
resignation with effect from 22 June 1990.   After consideration
the Deputy
Director General accepted Ms Adams' resignation.
<P>

	In my earlier letter to you I stated that the Department demands the highest
possible standards of skill, care and commitment from
its staff.  The actions
taken by the  Department in this mater confirm my statement.
<P>

	I re-affirm my earlier assurances that you need have no further anxiety for
Timothy's welfare."
<P>

14	Mrs McDonald testified that someone from the department had telephoned her
and told her that Sister Adams had been dismissed
and when she learned that, in
lieu of dismissal, resignation had been accepted she felt that she had not been
told the truth.  She
was unable precisely to locate the time of information
receipt and it is quite conceivable that she was told that a decision had
been
made to dismiss Sister Adams (as it was) and, as the evidence shows that the
acceptance of resignation followed a subsequent
decision, both communications
might well have been accurate at the time they were made.  
<P>

15	Mrs McDonald sought all the documentation concerning the enquiry and this
was not supplied to her.  Some insight is available
from a document tendered by
the plaintiff (Exhibit WW) which is an undated briefing note to the Minister
from Ms Meredith (a regional
officer) which noted that the above recited letter
to Mrs McDonald had been sent following her request for full documentation,
however:
<P>

	"Mrs McDonald was extremely angry and upset that she had not received the
information which she requested from the Department and
contacted Mr Kerry
Boyle and indicated that she was considering approaching the media including
the Hinch Program, and the Redfern
Legal Rights Centre, and that she intended
to exercise her rights under the Freedom of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia144/" class="autolink_findacts">Information Act</a>."
<P>

16	On 14 August 1990 Ms Meredith and Mr Boyle visited Mrs McDonald and gave her
details substantially amounting to particulars of
the assaults.  Mrs McDonald
asked for the information to be given to her in writing but was informed that
such a request would need
to be dealt with by the Director General.  A further
comment was added in the briefing note:
<P>

	"Mrs McDonald is extremely angry, and referred to the situation, and the
Department's actions in accepting Sr. Adams' resignation,
as `despicable',
`unforgivable', and stated that she does not intend to let the matter rest nor
to let Sister Adams `get off scot-free'."
<P>

17	On 30 August 1990 Mrs McDonald took the plaintiff out of full time residence
at Strathallen.  He has returned for day and respite
care on occasions since
then.  A schedule of attendances has been extracted (Exhibit 7) from which it
can be observed in passing
that at a time critical to the emergence of
complaints about Sister Adams namely between 15 and 22 January 1990, the
plaintiff was
coincidentally on "short leave" in his mother's care.  
<P>

18	In October 1996 the plaintiff entered full time care at St John of God
Hospital, Goulburn from where he was transferred to Waminda
Nursing Home on 13
January 1997.  He remains there.  Although this is primarily an aged facility,
the plaintiff has an air conditioned
single bedroom.  A letter from the
Director of Nursing at Waminda (Exhibit SS) described the situation, the simple
things provided
to occupy or amuse the plaintiff and the interesting comment
that although he has no useful speech "by clever use of body language
and the
tone of his voice, one is able to deduce his wants, likes and so on".  The
Director stated that there was "no reason to assume
that Timothy will be unable
to remain here for as long as he or his family wishes." 
<P>

19	This action was commenced in the District Court in 1995.  It was transferred
to this Court by an order made on 27 May 1996. 
 
<P>

20	The plaintiff's claims were advanced in an Amended Statement of Claim filed
on 9 April 1997 and I deal with them in accordance
with that pleading.  In
short, the plaintiff claimed:
<P>

	(1)	That the defendant was vicariously liable in tort for the trespasses to
the person of the plaintiff by Sister Adams;
<P>

	(2)	That compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages should be awarded in
respect of those trespasses;
<P>

	(3)	That the defendant was vicariously liable for the negligence of the
members of the staff at Strathallen who failed to report
observed instances of
abuse;
<P>

	(4)	That those omissions by staff members were causative of damage to the
plaintiff and compensatory and aggravated damages were
sought;
<P>

	(5)	That the defendant in the management by the Department of Family and
Community Services of Strathallen Centre failed to institute
and maintain
adequate systems which ought to have avoided the trespasses or the continuation
of them;
<P>

	(6)	That the failure to institute and maintain an adequate and safe system was
causative of damage to the plaintiff and compensatory,
aggravated and exemplary
damages were sought, and
<P>

	(7)	As a particular item of compensatory damage the plaintiff sought the cost
of 24 hour care at rates applicable for commercial
carers for the ministrations
of the plaintiff's mother and other family members during the period from
August 1990 when he left Strathallen
until October 1996 when he entered St John
of God Hospital.
<P>

21	It is a matter of extreme difficulty to assess what actual damage the
assaults caused.  Mrs McDonald and Mrs Hogan described
their perceptions of the
plaintiff's changed demeanour, however the medical examination which followed
the reports to Mr Livermore
detected nothing of significance.  I gained the
impression that Mrs McDonald's anger, as for example conveyed in the remarks
attributed
to her in the above quote from the briefing note, continues unabated
and that that mood was also to an extent shared by Mrs Hogan.
 Whilst I do not
doubt their loving devotion to the plaintiff (a matter for obvious admiration),
I am persuaded that their assessments
are affected by passion and lack
objectivity and where there is difference I prefer other assessments.
<P>

22	The various staff members who gave evidence of Sister Adams' conduct were
themselves familiar with the plaintiff and saw him
in the frequent routine of
their various employments.  All of them manifested a caring interest in him.
Mrs Cosgrove saw Sister Adams
place micropore over the plaintiff's mouth which
she herself immediately went to remove but this provoked Sister Adams to do so.
She also witnessed an incident of splashing with cold water whilst the
plaintiff was in the bath.  Her observation was that after
these incidents the
plaintiff settled down easily and fairly quickly.  Mrs Koromikalou saw Sister
Adams hold the plaintiff's nose
as a consequence of which his face turned blue.
She also saw an incident when Sister Adams stamped upon the plaintiff's feet
while
he was sitting on a bean bag.  The plaintiff's lower limbs are markedly
underdeveloped.  On each occasion she described the plaintiff
as reacting by
becoming hysterical.  Mrs Koromikalou thought that after these events the
plaintiff manifested a fear of Sister Adams
but after her departure in January
1990 she thought he was back to his old self, saying  "He was alright in a
happy environment.
 If he is okay, he is okay.  Depending on how you see to
him."
<P>

23	Ms Jacka observed two incidents involving Sister Adams disrupting the
plaintiff's nasal breathing, once by holding his nose with
her fingers and once
by placing a peg on it.  She also saw Sister Adams tread on the plaintiff's
hands and feet whilst he was sitting
in the bean bag.  Ms Jacka said that after
the departure of Sister Adams the plaintiff was "the same as he was before".
This opinion
was expressed in particular concerning her observations of the
plaintiff when he returned for day or respite stays after he had ceased
to be a
full time resident at Strathallen.  
<P>

24	Ms Wilson saw Sister Adams place a peg on the plaintiff's nose.  Ms Wilson
removed it, telling Sister Adams that she disapproved.
 It was claimed that the
intention was to stop the plaintiff regurgitating food but Ms Wilson saw that
the plaintiff was in obvious
distress which he showed by waving his arms about.
She thought he settled down quickly after the peg was removed.  She judged that
the plaintiff was well settled in cottage 5 and appeared to be so when he
returned from day or respite care after he had been withdrawn
by Mrs McDonald
in August 1990.
<P>

25	Ms Whittaker saw the plaintiff with a peg on his nose although she did not
see who applied it.  Sister Adams was in charge of
the cottage at the time.  On
another occasion she saw Sister Adams hold a bib over the plaintiff's face
after he had regurgitated
some food.  She witnessed a further incident when
Sister Adams pulled the plaintiff's head by the hair.  She perceived an annoyed
reaction by the plaintiff who made non verbal sounds of distress.  In her
testimony Ms Whittaker claimed little memory of these events
now many years
past but she asserted that she and others on the staff, with the exception of
Sister Adams, saw that the plaintiff
was well cared for.
<P>

26	Ms Shoppee saw Sister Adams put micropore across the plaintiff's mouth.  Ms
Shoppee removed it immediately and remonstrated with
her.  She also saw Sister
Adams hold the plaintiff's nose in an apparent attempt to make him swallow
food.  Ms Shoppee asked Sister
Adams to stop, which she did.  She noticed the
plaintiff flinch.  Ms Shoppee had been familiar with the plaintiff from the
time of
his arrival at Strathallen.  She had noted his immediate reaction to
Sister Adams' interference but overall she said that she never
noticed any
change in the plaintiff.
<P>

27	Ms Lacey had seen an incident involving Sister Adams and a resident Mr
Cannon.  She worked as a hospital assistant frequently
at cottage No 5.  She
knew the plaintiff.  To her observation the plaintiff appeared happy and
cheerful at Strathallen including
the period, to which her attention was
directed, following the inquiry concerning Sister Adams and her departure.  
<P>

28	Ms O'Donnell observed Sister Adams put a urine soaked napkin which she had
removed from the plaintiff's lower body across his
face.  Ms O'Donnell rebuked
Sister Adams and removed the item and wiped the plaintiff's face.  Apart from
the conduct by Sister Adams,
Ms O'Donnell observed that the plaintiff appeared
well cared for by herself and other staff and thought that he seemed to relate
well to them.
<P>

29	There is no evidence from any source of any physical injury or damage to the
plaintiff resulting from assault beyond the immediate
and passing reactions to
the interference with his person.  There were placed in evidence two reports
from Professor Shaddock, a
psychologist who is a professor of special education
at the University of Canberra.  He would appear to have made some contribution
to the record in the BIALA booklets (Exhibit 9A and B).  Professor Shaddock
emphasized that he was not a medical practitioner but
recognized that it was
necessary to contemplate medical factors as influential upon the plaintiff's
life and situation.  He made
three visits to the McDonald household in
September, October and December 1995.  Although under a heading in his report
indicating
an overview of findings, it is obvious that the factual matters as
to behaviour were derived by him from reports of others.  His
comment included
the following:
<P>

	"Early reports state that, at the time of the abuse, there were behavioural
indicators (night time screaming, uncharacteristic
fearfulness) that could have
been interpreted as indicators that something in his life was disturbing him.
Such behaviours are, in
the literature, associated with physical abuse.
However medical investigations at that time were inconclusive.
<P>

	Mr McDonald now lives at home, receiving day care at the Strathallen Centre
and fortnightly respite care at a private residence.
 Although he generally
appears quite happy, he is more wary and cautious than before the abuse.  He
needs reassurance (from his mother)
before he relaxes in the presence of
strangers.  He has also made some developmental gains since living at home.
<P>

	I found no indisputable evidence of long term, direct, negative effects on Mr
McDonald of the abuse.
<P>

	However, since the abuse of Mr McDonald's there has been some deterioration in
aspects of Mr McDonald's behaviour.  He is now abnormally
vigilant and
apprehensive; he needs constant reassurance; he is upset by breaks in routine
and he displays a general fearfulness."
<P>

30	The statement that medical investigations were inconclusive must be taken in
the context of support for the hypothesis of assault
and injury.  The medical
investigations detected no damage nor any condition of the plaintiff different
from his normal presentation.
<P>

31	In a later report Professor Shaddock adhered to his view concerning the
absence of long term, direct, negative effects of the
abuse but expressed a
qualification (on the probabilities) concerning the desirability of taking the
plaintiff home from Strathallen.
 I shall return to the issue of the plaintiff
being brought home when dealing with the claim for damages for provision of
voluntary
services.   Professor Shaddock also commented upon a series of
reports including those from Mrs McDonald and Mrs Hogan that the plaintiff
cried and squealed inconsolably at night, pinched and picked at his body, clung
to family members and regressed in the trust which
he showed but wanting people
to hold him.  Mrs McDonald also felt she was "snubbed" by her son after she was
absent for a few days
at a family funeral interstate.  It is not possible to
connect the lastmentioned with any event at Strathallen.  However Professor
Shaddock reported:
<P>

	"The literature on abuse of people with intellectual disability indicates that
the behaviours described above are frequently the
indicators of physical abuse.
Fortunately most of these behavioural changes appear to have been temporary in
Mr McDonald's case.
 However, it was reported that Mr McDonald now appears to
be habitually more anxious and insecure and he requires more stability
and
dependability in his immediate environment.  He is also more wary of strangers,
particularly and (inexplicably), of men.  He
needs constant reassurance from
those he trusts.  This general fearfulness was also reported by other
informants."
<P>

32	I find that each of the assaults had immediate impact upon the plaintiff in
causing him hurt and distress and that as a result,
there were engendered in
him for a time feelings of fear and mistrust.  The evidence does not enable
precise determination of when
the consequential effects ceased but it does not
satisfy me that they are continuing and, on the probabilities, I hold that any
effect
attributable to the assaults had ceased after the expiry of 12 months
beyond the events.  I am not suggesting that I find that they
lasted for 12
months but I have selected that as an outer marker point, as it were, of
consequences.  
<P>

33	I am conscious of course of the expression of view by Mrs McDonald in
particular that the effects are continuing but I consider
that that perception
is derived from her own anxieties and not from any tort induced damage to the
plaintiff.  The assaults were,
of course, criminal as well as tortious.  Mrs
McDonald's subjectivity is demonstrated in a remark reported in 1992 by Ms
Barbey,
a Goulburn community nurse coordinating developmental disability
services:
<P>

	"No-one can understand the horror I feel when I think that Timothy may have to
return to Strathallen when I am no longer able to
manage."
<P>

34	It is beyond argument that Sister Adams would, if sued, be liable to pay
damages to the plaintiff for the assaults.  The first
basis upon which claim is
made against the defendant is that it is vicariously liable for her conduct.
All of the assaults occurred
in the course of employment with the defendant.
Sister Adams has claimed or has been reported to have claimed that the
instances
of nasal obstruction (by fingers or pegs) and mouth taping were
designed to provoke swallowing regurgitated food during feeding of
the
plaintiff.  I do not accept such claims in the sense that any legitimate form
of nursing would call for such action but these
were activities which were
undertaken in purported performance of a particular employment task.  I have
not overlooked the denials
by Sister Adams reported in the preliminary inquiry
(Exhibit N) but I do not regard them as either acceptable or determinative of
the nexus between her acts and her employment. 
<P>

35	I find that the assaults consisting of stamping on hands and feet, flinging
the urine soaked napkin in the face, and pulling
the hair are in a different
category in the sense that it has never been claimed (so far as the evidence
called reveals) that any
of these acts was done in connection with any
particular reference to a task being undertaken in the course of Sister Adams'
employment.
<P>

36	Sister Adams asserted to Mr Smith who was conducting the preliminary inquiry
that she did not use cold water on the plaintiff
but had mixed hot and cold
water to obtain lukewarm liquid which needed to be done in that way in the
absence of appropriate facilities
such as a hose.  The evidence in the trial by
Ms Cosgrove was that the water was cold which she could assess because it
splashed
on her also.  The credibility of Sister Adams' reported explanation to
Mr Smith was undermined by the testimony from Ms Cosgrove
that at the time she
remarked  "It's good value".
<P>

37	The potential liability of the Crown in the right of the State of New South
Wales has been declared in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrla1983321/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983</a> which
provides:
<P>

	"8(1)	Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Crown is vicariously liable
in respect of the tort committed by a person in
the service of the Crown in the
performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an
independent function)
where the performance or purported performance of the
function:
<P>

(a)	is in the course of his service with the Crown or is an incident of his
service (whether or not it was a term of his appointment
to the service of the
Crown that he perform the function); or
<P>

(b)	is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business,
enterprise, undertaking or activity of the Crown."
<P>

37	Attention to that provision has recently been given in <b>Prior v The State
of New South Wales</b> CA unreported 23 October 1998.  Although differing from
the primary judge's conclusion in that case, Meagher JA recited without
disapproval
a construction of that provision that in order to found liability
first, one must find a tort committed by a person in the service
of the Crown,
second that the person was actually or purportedly performing a "function" and
third, that the tort must have been
committed by the person in the performance
or purported performance of that function.  Sheller JA (with whom Handley JA
agreed) referred
to <b>Commonwealth of Australia v Connell</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1986%205%20NSWLR%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1986 5 NSWLR
218:</a>
<P>

	"I would conclude that conduct by an apprentice sailor is within the scope of
his service or duty or authority if it is authorised
expressly or impliedly or
is incidental to what he is authorised to do even though it may be performed in
an unauthorised way.  If,
however, it is not authorised expressly or impliedly
and is not so connected with authorised conduct as to be an improper mode of
performing it, it is an independent unauthorised act and is outside the scope
of his service."  Per Glass JA, Samuels and Priestley
JJA concurring,
<P>

and to <b>Tiger Nominees Pty Limited v State Pollution Control Commission</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1992%2025%20NSWLR%20715" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1992 25 NSWLR 715</a> where Gleeson CJ, (Mahoney JA and Campbell J concurring)
adopted as a test for determining vicarious responsibility (in that case
a
criminal responsibility) attaching to an employer, the distinction "between a
mode, albeit improper, of doing that which the employee
is employed to do and
conduct which is outside the scope of the employee's employment".
<P>

38	Whilst vicarious liability undoubtedly has an arbitrary quality, the
tendency has been towards imposition.  It was long ago held
that a principal
was liable for the fraud of an agent acting within the scope of authority even
if committed for the benefit of the
agent: <b>Lloyd v Grace, Smith &amp; Co</b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1912/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1912] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1912%20AC%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1912 AC 716.</a>  The public policy factor is recognizable in very early
expressions of judicial thought.  Sir John Holt wrote in 1700 "........ seeing
somebody must be a loser by (this) deceit, it is more reason that he that
employs and puts a trust and confidence in the deceiver
should be a loser, than
a stranger":  <b>Hern v Nichols</b> 1701 1 Salk 289.  That observation was in
this century described by Scarman LJ (as he then was) as prophetic wisdom
(<b>Rose v Plenty</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] EWCA Civ 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1976%201%20All%20ER%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1976 1 All ER 97)</a> and, in similar vein to the situation
noted by Lord Scarman in <b>Rose</b>, I would recognize that that wisdom has no
direct application to the present case but there is "a family relationship".
<P>

39	The issue for determination is the vicarious liability of the defendant for
the trespasses to the person of the plaintiff by
Sister Adams.  Although I
accept that the actions in every case were incapable of being performed in the
proper administration of
nursing care, Sister Adams asserted that some of them
were designed to assist him particularly in suppressing food regurgitations.
That purport, even if it is unacceptable, remains significant.  Sister Adams
was employed, inter alia, to attend to feeding the plaintiff.
 Similarly it was
an incident of her employment to bathe him and, whilst her remark at the time
is suggestive of malice, in terms
of the test articulated in <b>Tiger
Nominees</b> this was an improper mode of doing what she was employed to do.
The same comment is applicable to the removal of the urine soaked
napkin which
was done, I have presumed, in the course of replacing it with a clean one.
There is some difficulty in reaching a similar
conclusion in respect of the
incidents of stamping on hands and the hair pulling but no submissions were
made based upon discriminating
between the assaults, the defendant contending
total denial of liability.  In the circumstances I am minded to find that all
of the
actions should be categorized as improper modes of doing what Sister
Adams was in the general sense employed to do, namely to attend
to the welfare
and daily living needs of the plaintiff. 
<P>

40	Accordingly I find that the defendant is vicariously liable to pay damages
for trespass to the person.   The nature of compensatory
damages is to reflect
hurt suffered.  Despite the plaintiff's inability to articulate complaint, I am
satisfied that from the observations
of reaction recounted by staff he was
conscious that hurt was being done to him.  There was no evidence of bodily
harm in the sense
of bruising, abrasion, laceration or like injury.  I note the
descriptions of mood change by Mrs McDonald and Mrs Hogan but as I
have already
held, I am unpersuaded that anything of that nature was causally connected to
any assault by Sister Adams after the
expiry of 12 months beyond her departure.
A particular aspect of claim was that what I have referred to as night terrors
were continuing.
 Mrs McDonald has described this uncontrollable squealing as
being observed on occasions when the plaintiff came home as he did from
time to
time including late 1989.  It was not until August 1990 that the plaintiff was
withdrawn from Strathallen and it must be
observed that there has been no
evidence of any report from any member of staff of manifestation of this
uncontrollable squealing
at night during the period between Sister Adams
departure and withdrawal of the plaintiff from Strathallen by his mother over
seven
months later.  Other than the description of conduct of Sister Adams
there was no evidence of malice towards the plaintiff and those
staff and
former staff who gave evidence impressed me as caring of the plaintiff and
interested in his welfare.  Taking all matters
into account I conclude that the
plaintiff probably did sometimes manifest sleep disturbance and produced sounds
of discomfort but
the descriptions from his mother and sister have exaggerated
both the intensity and the span of time over which the behaviour was
manifest.
I record that this conclusion is not premised upon any finding of deliberate
inaccuracy by those witnesses but the exaggeration
probably stemmed from loss
of objectivity consequent upon their deep anger and upset over what had
happened to the plaintiff.
<P>

41	The arguments presented on behalf of the plaintiff claimed damages specified
in categories of compensatory, aggravated and exemplary
damages.  I have
described this first element of claimed damages as compensatory to coordinate
with those submissions but it should
not be ignored that damages for trespass
to the person, in parallel with torts such as false arrest and false
imprisonment are at
large:  cf <b>Spautz v Butterworths</b> 1997 A Torts R
81-415.  To recognize that damages are at large is not to suggest that a trial
judge is authorized to select a figure
arbitrarily or idiosyncratically and
personal injury awards in more commonly litigated torts (such as negligence)
are available to
provide guidance by way of comparison: <b>Coyne v Citizen
Finance Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1991%20172%20CLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1991 172 CLR 211.</a>
<P>

42	In the present case the assaults were multiple and, to say the least, heaped
indignity as well as hurt upon a completely defenceless
person.  It is true
that the plaintiff undoubtedly lacks any appreciation of money or any form of
currency but he was not indifferent
to the treatment meted out to him as
witness his distressed responses and the use of his limited means of
expression.
<P>

43	I have not overlooked the slight discrepancy between the pleading which
asserted 13 assaults and the certificates of conviction
which total 12, however
I cannot correlate the certificates to the various acts described by witnesses
either by collating their
evidence, the depositions from the Goulburn Local
Court and/or the statements to the departmental inquiry.  It suffices in the
context
of this litigation to find that there were multiple trespasses upon the
plaintiff as described by the staff members and former staff
members in their
respective testimony.  I have previously summarized their observations.
<P>

44	I have reached the conclusion that a sum of $50,000 should be awarded for
the total of assaults including within that award reflection
of the
indignities, humiliations and mental suffering as well as any transient
feelings of hurt and disturbance to comfort and well
being.  That sum clearly
exceeds any sum proportioned to physical injury and discomfort and the
inclusion of the enhancement is frequently
described as an inclusion of
aggravated damages.  It was agreed that, should the plaintiff succeed in
recovering damages there should
be included two items of $2,483 and $850 (total
$3,333) for certain home and respite care and the amounts will be added to the
sum
which I have specified.
<P>

45	The plaintiff's contentions advanced a claim for aggravated damage as a
separate category.  The thrust of the argument was summarized
in a written
outline of submissions:
<P>

	"Aggravated damages ought be awarded because of the manner in which the tort
has been inflicted adds to the damage.  It has been
accompanied not only by
humiliation and a total demeaning of the subject of the assault but the same
has been inflicted upon a person
with a mental age of less than 1 year.  The
respective roles of the perpetrator and the victim are so disproportionate, so
far from
arm's length that aggravated damages of a massive order are called
for."
<P>

46	In the often quoted classification of damages by Lord Diplock (<b>Cassell
&amp; Co v Broome</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1972%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1972 AC 1027)</a> aggravated damages were described as
"additional compensation for the injured feelings of the plaintiff where his
sense of injury
resulting from the wrongful physical act is justifiably
heightened by the manner in which or the motive with which the defendant
did
it".
<P>

47	As observed in Street on <b>Damages</b> (1962) and quoted by Hogarth J in
<b>Costi v Minister of Education</b> 1973 5 SASR @ 332:
<P>

	"Evidence of the circumstances accompanying the commission of a tort for which
damages at large is a head of permissible damages
will, of course, be
permitted; when that evidence tends to show that a higher sum of damages will
be appropriate, the higher award
is often called aggravated damages.  Damages
are awarded in assault for the effect on the plaintiff's mental state produced
by the
defendant's threats ..... Aggravated damages then are not some separate
head of damages.  The essential question is what heads of
damages are legally
recoverable for the particular wrong.  Obviously, certain heads of damage such
as compensation for humiliation
and insult lend themselves more readily to
claims for aggravated damages ..... For at least two hundred years aggravated
damages
have been given for trespasses which have inflicted insult or
humiliation upon the plaintiff ......"
<P>

48	McGregor on <b>Damages</b> (16th Edn) contains these observations:
<P>

	"In so far as an assault and battery results in physical injury to the
plaintiff, the damages will be calculated as in any other
action for personal
injury.  However, beyond this, the tort of assault affords protection from the
insult which may arise from interference
with the person.  Thus a further
important head of damage is the injury to feelings, i.e. the indignity, mental
suffering, disgrace
and humiliation that may be caused.  Damages may thus be
recovered by a plaintiff for an assault, with or without a technical battery,
which has done him no physical injury at all.  While damages for the injury to
feelings may be given without their being classified
as aggravated damages, it
is usual to find, in the very few existing authorities, that the court does
make its award one of aggravated
damages."
<P>

49	The inclusion in the assessment which I have already made of compensation
for hurt, indignity and humiliation would be duplicated
were I to make a
separate award enhancing the already stated sum. 
<P>

50	One of the difficulties in dealing with these claims is the circumstance
that until 1964 Anglo-Australian courts did not distinguish
between aggravated
and exemplary damages.  See Luntz, Assessment of Damages 3rd End Chap 1.7.1.
Subsequent history has made the approach
contended for by the plaintiff
understandable and I recognize that there have been cases of separate awards in
three categories:
 e.g. <b>Stepanovic v G.I.O.</b> CA Unreported 29 March 1995.
On the other hand references in earlier cases to exemplary damages can be
identified as what would now
be called aggravated damages rather than exemplary
(punitive) damages or, most often, a combination of them both.
<P>

51	In the present case, compensatory damages directly proportioned to actual
injury would not greatly exceed a nominal sum but I
have included in the
assessment of $50,000 the factors abovementioned.  There is little available
guidance for an appropriate figure,
if indeed there be one.  In a somewhat
exotic case, a defendant who was banker, magistrate and Member of Parliament
(said to have
dined and drunk freely) upon his request to join a shooting party
being declined entered land with his dogs and fired at game (seeking
to borrow
more shot when his own was exhausted) and in intemperate language defied the
plaintiff estate owner to bring action:  <b>Merest v Harvey</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1814/330.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1814] EngR 330</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1814%205%20Taunt%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1814 5 Taunt
442</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=128%20ER%20761" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">128 ER 761.</a>  A verdict of five hundred pounds was left undisturbed
although it must be conceded that the language of Gibbs CJ appears to emphasize
the punitive character of permissible award.    Heath J (who had tried the
action at Norfolk assizes but sat with the Chief Justice
in Common Pleas)
remarked that he remembered a case where a jury gave five hundred pounds for
knocking a man's hat off and the court
refused a new trial.  He added that the
permission of juries to punish insult by exemplary damages would go to prevent
the practice
of duelling.  This rather dated reference is made to demonstrate
that (given the combination of aggravated/punitive damages) comparatively
large
sums of money have been deemed appropriate.
<P>

52	In <b>Stepanovic</b> separate awards of $10,000 and $15,000 for aggravated
and exemplary damages respectively were left undisturbed.  The trespass arose
out of a single event whereas Timothy McDonald was the victim of multiple
interferences.  It is convenient to mention that in <b>Stepanovic</b> the Court
(Kirby P, Priestley JA) affirmed the appropriateness  of taking into account on
the question of aggravated damages both
the conduct of the assailant and the
subsequent conduct of the litigation.  So far as the latter is concerned, I
have mentioned that
the hearing was conducted on the basis that the commission
of the assaults by Sister Adams was not disputed.  The liability of the
defendant for her actions was a matter of bona fide contest and I do not find
the failure to concede the assaults in the pleadings
was a matter of
significant additional hurt to the plaintiff in all the circumstances of this
case.
<P>

53	The foregoing is recorded in connection with my ultimate judgment that, in
today's terms of monetary value, damages should be
assessed at $50,000.
Counsel for the plaintiff specifically submitted that general and aggravated
damages should combine to a figure
of $150,000.   That figure was, as my
assessment has had to be, significantly the result of impression but I was
invited to draw
some comparison from the experiences of agony resulting from
stroke-induced paralysis described by the author Jean-Dominique Bauby
in "The
Diving Bell and the Butterfly".  Ultimately damages at large must be assessed
upon the evidence in a particular case gauged
in the context of contemporary
society and its perceived values.  It would not be astonishing if perceptions
failed to coincide.
<P>

54	I turn to the claim for exemplary damages.  The nature of these was
described by Lord Diplock in <b>Cassell</b> as "punishment of the defendant for
his anti-social behaviour to the plaintiff".  Windeyer J in <b>Uren v John
Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1966%20117%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1966 117 CLR 118</a> proposed that "..... exemplary
damages  ...... are intended to punish the defendant, and presumably serve one
or more of the objects
of punishment - moral retribution and deterrence."
<P>

55	This claim of course related to vicarious liability of the defendant for the
actions of the wrongdoer, Sister Adams, who was
not personally sued.  It is
difficult to conceive that such a derivative liability would call for
punishment in the circumstance
that the payer of damages is liable by
imputation rather than action and provides a strong basis for exercising
discretion against
such an award.  I do not ignore that in <b>Lamb v
Cotogno</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1987%20164%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1987 164 CLR 1</a> the tortfeasor was indemnified under a compulsory
scheme of insurance and that it was contemplated in that case that in
condemning
the actual wrongdoer (who was a defendant) the award of exemplary
damages would appease the victim and assuage any urge for revenge.
 The
plaintiff in this particular case by reason of his inherent developmental
disability would not be capable of harbouring urges
such as a desire for
vengeance.
<P>

56	There is however a more important reason contra indicating an award of
exemplary damages because, as the evidence of the certificates
of conviction
demonstrates, the wrongdoer herself has already had the criminal law brought to
bear on her for her actions.  In <b>Gray v Motor Accident Commission</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%2073%20ALJR%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1998
73 ALJR 45</a> a joint judgment (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ)
proclaimed this view:
<P>

	"[40] Where, as here, the criminal law has been brought to bear upon the
wrongdoer and substantial punishment inflicted, we consider
that exemplary
damages may not be awarded.  We say `may not' because we consider that the
infliction of substantial punishment for
what is substantially the same conduct
as the conduct which is the subject of the civil proceeding is a bar to the
award; the decision
is not one that is reached as a matter of discretion
dependent upon the facts and circumstances in each particular case.
<P>

	[41] There are at least two reasons in principle why that is so.
<P>

	[42] First the purposes for the awarding of exemplary damages have been wholly
met if substantial punishment is exacted by the
criminal law.  The offender is
punished; other are deterred.  There is, then, no occasion for their award.
<P>

	[43] Secondly, considerations of double punishment would otherwise arise.  In
<b>R v Hoar</b> Gibbs CJ Mason, Aickin and Brennan JJ said that there is `a
practice, if not a rule of law, that a person should not be twice punished
for
what is substantially the same act'.  That practice or rule would be breached
by an award of exemplary damages in the circumstances
described."
<P>

57	The penalties visited upon Sister Adams were non custodial.  In <b>Gray</b>
the Court did not need to determine what extent of punishment would meet the
requirement of being "substantial" but after noting
that that issue did not
fall for decision in that case their Honours observed:
<P>

	"[46] ........... At first sight, however, if criminal charges, alleging the
same conduct as is alleged in a civil proceeding,
have been brought and proved,
it would be a most unusual case in which it was open to a civil court to
conclude that the outcome
of those criminal proceedings did not take sufficient
account of the need to punish the offender and deter others from like conduct.
There seems to be much to be said in favour of the views reached by a majority
of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in <b>Daniels v Thompson</b> that for a
civil court to revisit a sentence imposed in a criminal court for the purpose
of deciding whether the criminal received
his or her just deserts is `contrary
to principle' and must `undermine the criminal process'."
<P>

58	There is some Canadian authority for the proposition that where a defendant
has been conditionally discharged in criminal proceedings
exemplary damages may
remain available: <b>Connors v Doak</b> 1978 24 NBR 2d (85) ( a case of
conversion of goods) but I would doubt that a conditional discharge under s
662.1(1) of the Criminal
Code of New Brunswick is necessarily an equivalently
substantial penalty to deferral of sentence on conditions pursuant to s 558
of
the Crimes Act.
<P>

59	I derive guidance from the dictum in <b>Gray</b> and am fortified by the
expressed favour for the approach in New Zealand revealed in <b>Daniels</b> and
in addition to the reasons already stated, I would decline to enhance the
damages which I have assessed by an element of exemplary
damages.  
<P>

60	The first alternative presentation of the plaintiff's case is as an action
in negligence asserting vicarious liability of the
defendant arising out of the
omissions of nursing staff and hospital assistants to report their observations
of abuse of the plaintiff
by Sister Adams to authority.  It was conceded by
counsel that, even if this cause of action were to be made out it could not
attract
exemplary damages.
<P>

61	It is implicit in the case framed in this fashion that sooner reporting
would have avoided some of the damage to the plaintiff.
 A staff member
obviously could only report what he or she saw and thus even the promptest
reporting could not logically have avoided
the first incident even if it was
observed.   There was an understandable lack of precision about when any event
seen by the various
witnesses took place.  The state of the evidence makes it
quite impossible therefore to find when any particular assault took place
and
consequently what damage might have been avoided if early reporting had been
made.  By reason of the deficit in evidence, there
exists also an obstacle to
finding causation of damage by any specific failure to report and a general
allegation of failure to report
does not sustain the cause of action.  Even if
this conclusion be incorrect, I would not assess the damages any differently
from
those which I have determined in relation to the cause of action pleaded
in trespass.
<P>

62	The second alternative cause of action can briefly be described as couched
in terms of an action for negligence arising out of
the alleged failure of the
Department of Family and Community Services to devise, institute and maintain
systems of operation so
as to avoid unnecessary risk of injury to the
plaintiff.  Over objection, I permitted the plaintiff to file amended
particulars of
negligence in advancement of the claim in these terms:
<P>

	"(i)	Failed to exercise sufficient supervision over its nursing staff to
prevent unlawful assaults upon intellectually disabled
residents in its
care;
<P>

	(ii)	Failed to ensure the safety of all disabled residents at Strathallen;
<P>

	(iii)	Failed to ensure that nursing staff at Strathallen delivered nursing
service to residents in accordance with a standard expected
of skilled and
competent nursing staff;
<P>

	(iv)	Failed to adequately train staff to intervene to protect residents whose
welfare was being abused by other staff;
<P>

	(v)	Failed to maintain an adequate grievance procedure for staff to notify the
management of the Department of Family &amp; Community
Services of the
misconduct of other staff members;
<P>

	(vi)	Failed to prevent any further assaults occurring on residents after
becoming aware of such assaults on residents;
<P>

	(vii)	Failed to ensure that the plaintiff's family was alerted to any abuse to
which he was subjected immediately upon becoming
aware of such abuse;
<P>

	(viii)	Failure to guard against a known and documented risk of abuse within
facilities such as Strathallen;
<P>

	(ix)	Failed to put in place systems or procedures which would have avoided the
assaults upon the plaintiff or the continuation
of them;
<P>

	(x)	Failed to report abuse which had been observed or witnessed;
<P>

	(xi)	Failed by investigation or otherwise to uncover abuse to the plaintiff
when behavioural changes indicative of abuse were drawn
to the attention of Mr
Livermore and/or the hospital administration;
<P>

	(xii)	Failed to have systems or procedures in relation to abuse or the
reporting of it or its possible indicia that would have
brought such matters as
Mr Livermore drew attention to, to the attention of the Executive Officer;
<P>

	(xiii)	Allowing verbal abuse to continue unchecked;
<P>

	(xiv)	Failing to treat verbal abuse as a warning of the possible or likely
occurrence of other abuse;
<P>

	(xv)	Failing to enquire of staff as to whether abuse or indicia of abuse had
been observed."
<P>

63	The plaintiff's case on this cause was sought to be supported by a
considerable volume of documents in handbooks, reports, policy
statements and
departmental memoranda.  It was contended by the defendant that there was no
evidence of what the system should have
been and that, in the absence of expert
evidence, I could not by a process of divination as it were, determine what a
reasonable
system should have been.  There is evidence of the institution of
new systems and procedures which, if they had been in effect, probably
would
have brought Sister Adams' misdeeds to attention earlier and probably would
have prevented at least some of them.  It was argued
by the defendant that the
change emerged upon the introduction of new legislation, and that is
historically so, but it was not suggested
that legislation was an essential
pre-requisite to adoption of more effective systems for the reporting of and
the prevention of
misconduct by staff.  The new system demonstrated what might
have been done if minds had at the relevant time been turned to the
possible
problem.  I do not mean to assert that every aspect of change wrought by what
was referred to as the "new Act" could have
occurred in the absence of the
statute but there was no inhibition on introducing some effective procedures at
an earlier date.
<P>

64	Some forceful submissions were advanced on behalf of the plaintiff asserting
that the removal of Strathallen Centre from the
schedule to the Public
Hospitals Act was germane to the causation of the plaintiff's damage.  I
specifically reject the contention
that legislative action or authorized
"de-gazettal" was an element in founding any private right in the plaintiff.

<P>

65	I do not regard it as necessary to analyse the issues raised on this cause
of action in detail because the outcome of the litigation
by way of verdict
will not alter and it suffices to record that I find that on the probabilities
some of the assaults by Sister Adams
would have been avoided if reasonable
attention had been paid to devising an adequate system for having the
misbehaviour of staff
reported and an adequate system instituted for ensuring
appropriate response to report of such misbehaviour.  Part of any such system
would involve communicating to staff what their responsibilities were in
relation to reporting and establishing alternative means
of so doing so that
rigid adherence to a chain of authority would not frustrate reporting that was
needed where the alleged miscreant
was a superior to the would-be informant.
That conclusion does not require expertise or specific knowledge of any
particular bureaucratic
structure. 
<P>

66	In my view therefore, subject to the claims for aggravated and exemplary
damages in the terms pursued, the plaintiff's success
on this cause of action
would not attract compensatory damages greater than would be payable in respect
of the trespass.  Non-punitive
damages for trespass and negligence arising out
of the same events are not recoverable cumulatively and it would become
something
of a hypothetical exercise to further pursue this alternative cause
of action.  I would not enhance the compensatory damages consequent
upon a
finding in favour of the plaintiff in negligence.  The negligence of the
defendant did not heighten the injuries or sense
of injury by the manner or
motive whereby the tort was committed.  Appeasement and assuagement of desire
for revenge are not relevant
in this case.   This cause of action is framed to
impose a direct responsibility upon the defendant for acts and omissions
different
from its vicarious liability for the acts of Sister Adams which were
capable of heightening the nature of injury.  
<P>

67	The claim for exemplary damages based upon this cause of action is
postulated differently from that referrable to the claim for
such damages
referrable to trespass.  Attention was drawn to the decision of the House of
Lords in <b>Rookes v Barnard</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1964/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1964%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1964 AC 1129</a> where one of the identified
categories in which such damages might be awarded was described as oppressive,
arbitrary or unconstitutional
acts by government servants.  Significant aspects
of that decision have not been followed in Australia particularly relating to
the
limitation of categories in which exemplary damages might be awarded (see
<b>Uren</b>) but therefore, so the argument ran, so much more emphatic would be
the call to award such damages where there was conduct fitting
the above
description by government servants.  
<P>

68	Although the remarks were provoked by reference to debate about whether
trespass could be committed negligently and noting that
in the instant case the
question arose of an intentional wrong being committed by inadvertence, in the
joint judgment in <b>Gray</b> their Honours recorded these observations which
are pertinent:
<P>

	"[22] ........For present purposes it is enough to note two things. First,
exemplary damages could not properly be awarded in a
case of alleged negligence
in which there was no conscious wrongdoing by the defendant.  Ordinarily, then,
questions of exemplary
damages will not arise in most negligence cases be they
motor accident or other kinds of case.  But there can be cases, framed in
negligence, in which the defendant can be shown to have acted consciously in
contumelious disregard of the rights of the plaintiff
or persons in the
position of the plaintiff.  Cases of an employer's failure to provide a safe
system of work for employees in which
it is demonstrated that the employer,
well knowing of an extreme danger thus created, persisted in employing the
unsafe system might,
perhaps, be of that latter kind.  No doubt other examples
can be found."
<P>

69	The second matter adverted to by their Honours was the circumstance that in
<b>Gray</b> the action was pleaded in negligence but appeared to have been
conducted at trial by all concerned as an action in trespass.  
<P>

70	The plaintiff again faces the obstacle on this issue that the asserted
negligence of the defendant was inconsequential without
the causative acts of
assault by Sister Adams for which she has been dealt with under the criminal
law.  Arguing that the principles
discussed in <b>Gray</b> presented no barrier
to recovery of exemplary damages counsel for the plaintiff contended that the
evidence showed a contumelious
disregard by the defendant for the rights of the
plaintiff in several respects.  A vigorous attack was launched against Mr Boyle
who was, effectively, the chief executive on site at Strathallen.  It was said
that his lack of knowledge was "breathtaking".  In
cross examination he
conceded that he was unaware of some nominated reports described later in
submissions by counsel as major inquiries
identifying the risk of abuse and the
need for systems to be put in place to detect and avoid it.  Included, for
example, was a review
of standards of patient care in 5th Schedule Hospitals
dated 1987 by a ministerial advisory committee chaired by Ms Merilyn Walton
the
manager of the complaints unit within the Department of Health.  Although the
document is now no doubt in public domain (Exhibit
NN has a State Library
catalogue number imprinted on it) it is a matter of speculation whether it was
circulated to Mr Boyle.  The
title of the committee suggests that any report
would be directed to the minister and no doubt distribution thereafter would be
at
the minister's discretion and direction. 
<P>

71	It was argued to be relevant that the defendant through Mr Boyle failed to
report Sister Adams' conduct to police and failed
to forward information about
it to the Nurses Registration Board until urged by Mrs McDonald so to do.
Mention was made of the absence
of thanks by way of acknowledgment to those who
did complain and the apparent absence of inquiry into the failure of Mr Mills
to
react to complaint.  I have elsewhere canvassed the reasonableness of
requiring complaint in writing before reacting or acting. 
The accumulation of
these and other matters which it is unnecessary to tabulate was said to create
a situation which ought to be
gauged against the circumstances that "no change
was instituted of a sort that would rectify the gross and known deficiencies
which
had demonstrably permitted a horrendous situation to develop concerning
Sister Adams."  
<P>

72	The evidence does not justify that language.  The assaults were despicable
by reason of the helplessness of the victim but the
delay in detecting what had
happened and removing the perpetrator represented a system failure rather than
oppressive, arbitrary
or unconstitutional acts by goverment servants.  There
can be no reasonable complaint about response once the matters were drawn
to
attention.  Leaving aside the approaches said to have been made to Mr Mills,
Sister Adams had been removed from cottage 5 within
about a week of the matter
being raised.   Even if one took a time span from the approaches to Mr Mills it
extends to about two weeks.
 I reject the claim for exemplary damages.  
<P>

73	In support of submissions counsel for the plaintiff handed up a document
headed "Particulars of Exemplary Damages".  I have not
dealt seriatim with the
thirty six various expressions paragraphed therein.  Neither individually nor
cumulatively do I find that
the contentions support an award of exemplary
damages. 
<P>

74	I will refer the final ingredient of damage claimed for convenience as
"voluntary care".  A calculation was submitted manifesting
the cost of
provision of care at commercial rates for the plaintiff for 24 hours per day
carers between August 1990 when he was withdrawn
from Strathallen until October
1996 when he entered the St John of God Hospice at Goulburn from where he
transferred to his current
residence.  During that span the plaintiff was cared
for by Mrs McDonald with assistance from other family, principally Mrs Hogan.
There were periods of respite in fact at Strathallen but it was stated, without
demur on behalf of the defendant that the rates were
such that arithmetical
discounts would produce no significant variation to the quantum of claim which
was for many hundreds of thousands
of dollars. 
<P>

75	A fundamental determination must be made of the reasons for (and the
reasonableness) of the removal of the plaintiff from Strathallen
in August 1990
which was more than six months after he could possibly be at any risk from
assault by Sister Adams.  The decision
for removal was made by Mrs McDonald.
As abovementioned, it appears that she had formed the impression that there
were no more than
two charges of assault to be brought against the offender
although I am not satisfied that information in those terms, that the charges
were limited to two, was conveyed to her by any representative of the
defendant.  I accept that she had come to believe this although
it is not clear
why the number of assaults, as distinct from the nature and quality of actions
constituting any assault, should have
been regarded by her as of over-arching
importance.  The trigger for removal of the plaintiff from Strathallen seems to
have been
information from Ms Meredith on the occasion of her visit.  Mrs
McDonald gave this evidence:
<P>

	"Q.	At some point in time you took Timothy out of Strathallen?
<P>

	A.	Yes, that's right.
<P>

	Q.	When was that?
<P>

	A.	Would have been very shortly after Jo Meredith came and told me the charge.
I couldn't believe it and I took him out but I can't
remember exactly.
<P>

	Q.	And you are refer to the conversation you told the court about before the
adjournment?
<P>

	A.	Yes, that's right.
<P>

	Q.	That occurred, as you believe, in or about August of 1990?
<P>

	A.	Mmm.
<P>

	Q.	Why did you take him out then?
<P>

	A.	Well, I was only told, I was always under the impression that was only two
charges and that's all I had been told and when I
was told I found it so
unbelievable that anybody could do anything like that and I was upset for
Timothy.  I thought why should anybody
do anything like that when we have never
hurt him and I just thought it was unfair.
<P>

	Q.	Up until that point when you got this information from Miss Meredith how
significant did you think the assaults had been based
on what you had been told
by -
<P>

	A.	I was told there was only the two and that's all I believed and I just, I
was told I just had to wait and that's what I did
and I was never told anything
and I never asked because I was told I wasn't to and I just let it go and when
this all came out it
was a shock."
<P>

76	And in cross examination she responded:
<P>

	"Q.	Now in August 1990 you decided to take him out of Strathallen as a
full-time person?
<P>

	A.	That's true.
<P>

	Q.	You spoke with Mr Livermore about that, did you not, about that
decision?
<P>

	A.	No I probably told him.
<P>

	Q.	You told Mr Livermore all right, did Mr Livermore give you any advice?
<P>

	A.	I can't remember.
<P>

	Q.	Did Mr Livermore suggest to you that you should leave him in
Strathallen?
<P>

	A.	I can't remember sir.
<P>

	Q.	Did Mr Livermore say to you something along the lines or reassure you about
his safety?
<P>

	A.	I can't remember that he might have done, I can't remember."
<P>

77	And:
<P>

	"Q.	You didn't speak to anybody at Strathallen before you took him out?
<P>

	A.	If I had spoken to somebody it would have been Mr Livermore, I must have
said I want to take him home.
<P>

	Q.	You didn't take any advice or counsel?
<P>

	A.	I didn't get any advice or counsel.
<P>

	Q.	Did you ask for any counsel or advice?
<P>

	A.	I didn't know there was any given and I wasn't offered it.
<P>

	Q.	Did you ask Mr Livermore whether he could give yo some advice?
<P>

	A.	We had talks but he didn't give me advice that much.
<P>

	Q.	He didn't give you advice that much?
<P>

	A.	It was only in talking, I didn't know there was any services I could
get.
<P>

	Q.	What about from Mr Livermore, he spent quite a lot of time with you at that
stage?
<P>

	A.	He would come in.
<P>

	Q.	Spend half an hour, sometimes an hour?
<P>

	A.	Come to the house, stay an hour sometimes.
<P>

	Q.	Didn't you and he talk about the possibility of taking Tim out of
Strathallen?
<P>

	A.	What date was this supposed to be?
<P>

	Q.	August or so?
<P>

	A.	I can't remember sir if I did.  I know I was very upset when I heard the
charges and what I said and the charges, I can't now."
<P>

78	And:
<P>

	"Q.	Is this the situation that you do recall that Mr Livermore advised against
you taking Tim out of Strathallen?
<P>

	A.	I can't remember that.
<P>

	Q.	Don't remember that?
<P>

	A.	No all I know I was emphatic myself and I would not have listened to anyone
else."
<P>

79	Mrs McDonald had noticed no change in the plaintiff between February (by
which time Sister Adams had left) and August when he
was removed by her.  In
answer to express question she said she thought he was the same (transcript p
172 l 27).
<P>

80	Whilst the view of Gibbs J (as he then was ) expounded in <b>Griffiths v
Kerkemeyer</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1976%2d7%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1976-7 139 CLR 161</a> @ 165 that damages of the species now under
discussion are payable to a plaintiff only to the extent that the need was or
may be
productive of financial loss was not followed in <b>Van Gervan v
Fenton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1992%20175%20CLR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1992 175 CLR 323</a> and thus his proposition of two stage approach,
first is it reasonably necessary to provide the services and second, would it
be
reasonably necessary to do so at cost is disapproved, it is disapproved only
to the extent of the second stage question.  It remains
essential for the
plaintiff to show that the services received were to fulfil a tort induced
need:  <b>Nguyen v Nguyen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1990%20169%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1990 169 CLR 245.</a>  
<P>

81	Absent tort, the plaintiff would have received care at Strathallen.  I find
the evidence establishes that the removal from there
was not for the purpose of
fulfilling any tort induced need but was the consequence of a choice by Mrs
McDonald inspired by her upset
and anger and it follows that the notional
incurring of costs for voluntary services was not relevantly caused by breach
of duty
by the defendant: cf <b>CES v Superclinics (Aust) Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%2038%20NSWLR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995
38 NSWLR 47</a> @ 84D.
<P>

82	Counsel referred me to <b>Johnston v G.I.O.</b> Unreported Finlay J 2 Dec
1993.  I do not regard the award of damages for the added cost of caring for a
disabled child born to a
tortiously brain damaged claimant as providing a
precedential imperative for the damages claimed in this aspect of this case.
<P>

83	Accordingly I find the plaintiff is entitled to damages of $53,333.  The
plaintiff is himself, of course, oblivious to this litigation.
 He was not
however, as the evidence shows, insensitive to the feelings of pain and
discomfort and he is not disentitled to damages
as if he were insensible:
contrast <b>Skelton v Collins</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1996%20115%20CLR%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1996 115 CLR 94.</a>  The circumstance that he
has no memory of the tortious occurrences (as I find to be the case) does not
operate to reduce the damages:
cf <b>Del Ponti v Del Ponti</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1987%2011%20NSWLR%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1987 11 NSWLR
498.</a>  I recognize as Kirby P (as he then was) discussed @ p 503 et seq that the
treatment of damages in this category has not been wholly
satisfactory but
given the circumstances of this case I do not perceive entry of judgment for
the plaintiff as I have proposed as
being other than just between the parties.

<P>

84	There are outstanding issues including interest and the cost of
administering investment of the verdict, possible application
for payment out
and the question of costs.  I indicated at the conclusion of the hearing that
liberty to apply would be granted in
respect of outstanding matters and I so
order.  
<P>

85	Subject to the foregoing I set the amount of the plaintiff's damages at
$53,333 as stated and I will fix a date for dealing with
ancillary questions
and the formal entry of judgment.
<P>
