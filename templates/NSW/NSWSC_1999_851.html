<b>3970/96	PETER WESTGARTH DRINKWATER &amp; ORS   -v-   CADDYRACK PTY LIMITED
&amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   The substantive proceedings were heard
before Mr Justice Young in 1997. His Honour made orders on 23 October 1997. His
Honour made
subsequent orders on 28 November 1997 (which were entered on 12
December 1997) to give effect to the essential items of relief claimed
by the
plaintiffs. That relief included a buy-back by the fifth and sixth defendants,
Gedrot Pty Limited and Gavros Pty Limited of
the shares held by the first
plaintiffs Peter Westgarth Drinkwater and John Francis Drinkwater in the first
defendant Caddyrack Pty
Limited. Substantive relief in that regard was
contained in orders 2 and 3, as follows:
<P>

2.	The Fifth and Sixth Defendants purchase the shares which the Second
Plaintiff (or in the alternative the First Plaintiffs) hold
in the First
Defendant (the "Shares") at a valuation to be agreed to assessed in accordance
with orders 3 to 5 herein. 
<P>

3.	For the purposes of determining the value of the Shares in order 2 the
appropriate date from which the Shares are to be valued
is 25 September 1997.

<P>

2   	In making order 2 His Honour invoked section 260 of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> (now renumbered as section 246AA), which makes
provision for the purchase of the shares of any member of a company by other
members.
That section does not provide the Court with any guidance or direction
as to how the purchase price of the shares is to be determined.

<P>

3   	However, the Court recognises that where, as here, its
function is to determine the valuation of shares at a particular date,
the
overriding requirement is that the valuation should be fair on the facts of the
particular case (<i>Re London School of Electronics Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%203%20WLR%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 3 WLR

of the Federal Court of Australia (Spender, O'Loughlin and Branson JJ) quoted
with approval the foregoing
passage from the judgment of Nourse<i> </i>J in
<i>Re London School of Electronics Limited, </i>at 484).
<P>

4   	The parties failed to agree as to the value of the shares,
and, in consequence, the matter has come before me upon an inquiry
to ascertain
and thereafter certify the value of the shares (pursuant to order 6 made by his
Honour).
<P>

5   	Essentially, the inquiry before me concerned the evidence
of the expert witnesses retained respectively by the plaintiffs and
by the
defendants. (It will be appreciated that, although I shall in this judgment
speak of the defendants, that phrase will essentially
encompass only the fifth
and sixth defendants.)
<P>

6   	The plaintiffs relied upon the evidence of Garth Warren
Griffiths, a valuer, and Christopher Michael Hewitt, a chartered accountant;
whilst the defendants relied upon the evidence of Steven Chamberlain Pritchard,
an accountant.
<P>

7   	Mr Griffiths is a registered valuer (since 1978), a
licensed real estate agent and a licensed business agent. He is a Fellow
of the
Australian Society of Real Estate Agents and Valuers Ltd, a Fellow of the
Australian Institute of Business Brokers Inc.; and
the National President of
that latter entity. He has been involved in the real estate and business sales
industry for thirty-two
years. 
<P>

8   	Mr Griffith's valuation dated 10 march 1998 is Exhibit GG1
to his affidavit of 24 November 1998. 
<P>

9   	The approach adopted by Mr Griffiths was to capitalise the
maintainable earnings of what in his report he has compendiously
described as
"the business trading as Caddyrack" (the proprietorship and history of which
are set forth in item 2 of his report).
His starting point was the declared
profit for the Caddyrack companies shown in the consolidated accounts for the
year ended 30 June
1997. He then adjusted that figure to arrive at assumed
maintainable earnings if the business had been effectively operated. That
is to
say, he took into consideration excessive production costs (such as the number
of company vehicles and staff) and expenses
that were caused by the owner's
personal financial position, rather than costs caused by operating the business
itself. In effect,
what Mr Griffiths did was to value the business as a
separate and distinct asset of the Caddyrack company. 
<P>

10   	Mr Griffiths' reasoning for his adjustments were all
explained both in his report and in his oral evidence. In summary, he
estimated
what amount the maintainable earnings the business should be returning, and
then capitalised that figure in order to give
a purchase value for the
business.
<P>

11   	Mr Griffiths' report included (as Attachment 9 thereto) a
report dated 20 March 1998 from Mr Hewitt. A supplementary report,
dated 17
March 1999 from Mr Hewitt was also placed in evidence (Exhibit C). 
<P>

12   	Mr Hewitt then took the asset value of the business
produced by Mr Griffiths, and adjusted it for the remaining assets and
liabilities of the business. 
<P>

13   	The valuation methodology adopted by the plaintiffs was
described in submissions prepared by their Counsel as an overall net
asset
valuation with the prime asset of the companies (the business) being determined
on a capitalisation of maintainable profits.
<P>

14   	The ultimate consequence of the reports of Mr Griffiths
and Mr Hewitt was to give to each of the forty ordinary shares in
Caddyrack Pty
Limited a valuation of $41,495.
<P>

15   	Mr Pritchard upon whose evidence the defendants relied,
was a Certified Practising Accountant. He was a director of Rees Pritchard
Pty
Limited (described as "a firm of Certified Practising Accountants"), which had
been the professional accountants for Caddyrack
Pty Limited since November 1996
and for Caddyrack International Pty Limited since its incorporation. Mr
Pritchard's report was Annexure
A to his affidavit of 17 March 1999. Mr
Pritchard's professional qualifications and expertise are set forth in Exhibit
1. He holds
the degree of Bachelor of Commerce from the University of
Newcastle, and a Diploma in Applied Finance and Investment from the Securities
Institute of Australia; he is a Certified Practising Accountant, and Associate
of the Securities Institute of Australia, a member
of the Stock Exchange of
Newcastle Limited, and is also a Fellow of the Taxation Institute of Australia.
Mr Pritchard is a director
of the Stock Exchange of Newcastle Limited, and a
past chairman of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants,
Newcastle
and Hunter Valley Branch. He has had more than fifteen years'
experience as a director of Rees Pritchard Pty Limited, Certified Practising
Accountants, and Pritchard &amp; Partners Pty Limited, Stockbrokers and
Investment Advisers.
<P>

16   	At the outset, there was objection by the plaintiffs to Mr
Pritchard being allowed to give opinion evidence. After a hearing
on the
<i>voir dire</i> on this objection and on the status of Mr Pritchard as an
expert witness, I allowed Mr Pritchard to give opinion evidence. That ruling,
of course, did not pre-empt any ultimate conclusions concerning the
qualifications and experience of Mr Pritchard or the weight to
be attached to
his opinion evidence.
<P>

17   	Mr Pritchard, in item 6 of his report, referred to what he
described as "two generally accepted methods" of valuing shares
in a company
such as the first defendant, those methods being (i) capitalisation of future
maintainable profits; and (ii) net tangible
assets per share at current
value.
<P>

18   	Mr Pritchard proceeded to explain each of those bases. In
regard to future maintainable profits, he listed the operating profits
before
tax of the first defendant in the period since it commenced business in 1994,
and adjusted those profits by eliminating legal
costs. 
<P>

19   	He arrived at a result disclosing the average profit/loss
of the first defendant before tax as being a loss of $154,458. He
then
expressed the following conclusion. 
<P>

20   	Since Caddyrack Pty Limited had incurred an operating loss
in every year except one since it commenced business, and since
it did not have
any legally enforceable right to the use of the intellectual property which
underpins its business, Mr Pritchard
was of the view that it was not possible
to predict with any certainty what its future maintainable profits would be.
<P>

21   	Mr Pritchard then proceeded to apply his alternative basis
of valuation, that based upon net tangible assets at current values.
That
approach, based upon the consolidated balance sheet of Caddyrack Pty Limited
and Caddyrack International Pty Limited (which
disclosed a deficiency on
shareholders' funds of $562,965) led Mr Pritchard to the conclusion that there
would be no funds available
for distribution to the shareholders of Caddyrack
Pty Limited in the event of its ceasing to trade, and that its ability to
continue
as a going concern was dependent on the continuing financial support
of its bank and other creditors, and in particular, of the Drinkwater
and
Kyrwood families. In that regard Mr Pritchard noted that both the Drinkwaters
and the Kyrwoods had served upon Caddyrack Pty
Limited demands for repayment of
their respective loans. 
<P>

22   	He expressed the view that the preparation of a
consolidated balance sheet on a basis other than that as a going concern would
merely result in an increased deficiency on shareholder's funds, and would not
affect his opinion of the value of the shares in Caddyrack
Pty Limited.
<P>

23   	Mr Pritchard expressed his opinion that, in consequence,
the shares in Caddyrack Pty Limited had no net tangible asset value.

<P>

24   	Each of Mr Griffiths, Mr Hewitt and Mr Pritchard was
cross-examined during the course of the hearing. I have had the benefit
of
receiving written submissions from each Counsel who appeared at the enquiry
before me. Those submissions will be retained in the
Court file.
<P>

25   	In conducting the present enquiry the Court is reliant
upon evidence. In the instant case, that evidence has been given by
witnesses
who, having been put forward as expert witnesses (and having established at
least <i>prima facie</i> qualifications as such), have been allowed to offer
opinion evidence.
<P>

26   	It must be appreciated, however, when approaching the
concept of value, that a valuation is the means by which the worth of
an item
is determined; it is a process involving a valuer's personal judgment and
opinion rather than the strict application of accounting
principles or
arithmetic rules. For that reason, the value of an item might be assessed
differently by different persons. Further,
the value of an item may vary
depending on the purpose for which the valuation is required. There is,
therefore, no standard definition
of value for all purposes and in all
circumstances. (See, generally, Steven Sirianos<i>, </i>"Problems of Share
Valuation Under Section 260 of the Corporations Law" (13 Company and Securities
Law Journal, March 1995, 88, especially
at 90.)
<P>

27   	It is appropriate to pay heed to the salutory admonition
of Gallen J in the New Zealand case of <i>Lusk v Archive Security Limited
</i>(1991) 5 NZCLC 66,979 at 66,992,
<P>

There is ample authority to establish that valuations are not a matter of exact
science and not infrequently mathematical calculations
produce an authoritative
result which is in fact totally dependant upon bases which are not capable of
mathematical demonstration.
<P>

28   	In approaching the opinion evidence of the expert
witnesses in the instant case, especially that of Mr Pritchard, it is important
to bear in mind that here the purpose of the valuation is to attribute a value
to shares in Caddyrack Pty Limited which will be the
subject of a buy-back by
the fifth and sixth defendants from the plaintiffs, and will thus give to those
defendants and to the Kyrwood
interests a 100 per cent shareholding in the
first defendant.
<P>

29   	The respective reports of Mr Griffiths and Mr Pritchard
were the subject of criticisms by the expert of the opposing parties.
The
defendant submitted that the methodology adopted by Mr Griffiths in his
assessment of the "fair value of the shares" was flawed,
especially in the
assumption (which underlies the assessment of a "open market value") that each
party is assumed to be fully informed
about all relevant details concerning the
share sale transaction and the market in which it is to take place. It was
submitted on
behalf of the defendants that this assumption is important in
circumstances where the "overriding requirement is that the valuation
should be
fair on the facts of the particular case" (<i>Re London School of Electronics
Limited, supra</i>). The defendants challenged Mr Griffiths' valuation of the
company being based upon the ownership of an asset (being the exclusive
licence
of the patent to the golf club holder known as a "Caddyrack"), in circumstances
where there was no evidence that the company
owns that asset.
<P>

30   	It seems to me, however, that in circumstances where, as
in the instant case, the first defendant, whilst not the owner of
the patent,
has for a number of years been permitted to manufacture and deal with that
patent without any restraint from the legal
owner, it should not be assumed (as
the defendants would have the Court assume) that there will be some challenge
by that legal owner
to the dealing of the first defendant with that patent, or
some attempt to restrain the first defendant from continuing to deal with
it.
Where, as here, a private company is essentially controlled by two families and
the activities and assets of that company and
the intellectual property which
is the substantial asset of that company are also controlled by those two
families, it would be in
my view a quite artificial approach to assume that the
owner of the intellectual property (also controlled by those two families)
would prevent Caddyrack Pty Limited from continuing to deal with that
intellectual property in the manner in which it has been dealing
with it for a
number of years. The company is continuing to produce the golf club holders,
and there is no suggestion that it will
cease to do so.
<P>

31   	The second criticism of the Griffiths report was that, so
it was submitted on behalf of the defendants, that report adopted
two
inappropriate methods of valuation. The first method adopted in the Griffiths
report is the capitalisation of future maintainable
profits. The defendants
submit that the adoption of that method was not appropriate in the instant case
for the following reasons:
<P>

(a)	The average profits/losses of Caddyrack Pty Limited before tax for the
period 1994 to 1997 were a loss of $154,458 a year. 
<P>

(b)	Since Caddyrack Pty Limited has incurred losses in every year except one
since it commenced operations, it is not appropriate
to use the capitalisation
of "future maintainable profits" as the appropriate method of valuation of the
shares in the company.
<P>

(c)	Moreover, since Caddyrack Pty Limited does not have any legally enforceable
right to the use of the intellectual property rights
which underpin the
business, it is not possible to predict what the "future maintainable profit"
will be.
<P>

(d)	In light of the factors outlined above the defendants rely on the following
comments of W. Lonergan, <i>The Valuation of Businesses, Shares, and Other
Equity</i>, 2 ed. (1994) (Longman), 20,
<P>

While the capitalisation of FMP [future maintainable profits] is the most
commonly used valuation method, there are some situations
where it is not
appropriate. This method should not be used where there is
<P>

&#183;	a history of losses;
<P>

&#183;	rapidly declining profits in an industry with poor prospects;
<P>

&#183;	profitable trading but severe liquidity problems; or
<P>

&#183;	a single year's profit in a high risk market.
<P>

32   	The defendants, in adopting the foregoing opinion that the
capitalisation method as a valuation technique where the business
has a history
of losses is wholly inappropriate relied also upon  <i>Dynasty Pty Limited v
Coombs</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1312.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1312</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 1</a>,290 at 1,307 (a decision of the Full Court of the
Federal Court of Australia) and <i>Ledesma v Nobule Pty Limited</i> (Master
McLaughlin, 11 December 1997, unreported).
<P>

33   	Since Mr Griffiths under cross-examination agreed that
both Caddyrack Pty Limited and Caddyrack International Internation
Pty Limited
had a history of losses, as well as a single year's profit in a high risk
market, it was submitted on behalf of the defendants
that the capitalisation of
future maintainable profits should not be the valuation method adopted by the
Court in the instant case.
<P>

34   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
failure of Mr Griffiths to recognise the problems inherent in the valuation
method which he adopted further undermined his objectivity in the assessment of
the "fair value" of the shares; that the methodology
adopted and applied by Mr
Griffiths demonstrated his lack of expertise, and his basic lack of
understanding of the nature of the
methodology which he applied. The defendants
in this regard referred to the editorial comment made by Mr. Justice Young on
"The Role
of Experts"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJ 108.</a>
<P>

35   	The second method of valuation relied upon by Mr Griffiths
was headed "Assessment of Real Profit" (pages 12 to 14 of his report).
It was
submitted on behalf of the defendants that this was not a recognised method of
valuation, and that, in any event, the relevance
of the other entities referred
to by Mr Griffiths in that part of his report, and the evidence about those
other entities (being
Caddyrack Inc., Clubrack Pty Limited, and Golf Products
Promotions Limited) had not been proven and were not the subject of any part
of
his Honour's orders. The defendants submitted that it was impossible to sever
those parts of Mr Griffiths' report which refer
only to Caddyrack Pty Limited
and Caddyrack International Pty Limited from those parts of the report which
refer only to the other
entities. 
<P>

36   	The third major criticism directed by the defendants
against the Griffiths report was that it contains a large number of assumptions
which are entirely speculative and the factual basis for which has not been
proved. Those matters which the defendants assert to
be purely speculative are:
the existence of an implied consent of the owner of the intellectual property,
in the absence of an express
licence agreement, to allow the first defendant to
produce a golf club holder; that the right to manufacture such a golf club
holder
rests with Caddyrack Pty Limited, Caddyrack International Pty Limited
and Caddyrack Inc.; that the rights of those companies to manufacture
the golf
club holder has the consequence that the shares of Caddyrack Pty Limited have
significant value by virtue of the income
produced; and that "the business" (as
defined by Mr Griffiths under the heading "Proprietorship" at pages 3 - 4) has
manufactured
and sold many thousands of units and has generated a substantial
income in its infancy. Further, it was submitted that the Griffiths
report
assumes that the real profit can only be ascertained by consolidating the
trading results of a number of different entities;
and further, that it assumes
a figure of $100,000 to service trade debtors and stock levels of all five
entities. 
<P>

37   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
methodology adopted by Mr Griffiths was the ability of the subject business
to
generate future maintainable profits (and that in this regard a price-earnings
ratio of 2.5 was considered appropriate, with the
consequence that the return
on the investment became 40 percent), whilst, so it was submitted, there was no
evidence as to the determination
of the price-earnings ratio, or the
appropriateness thereof by reference to what was considered to be an
appropriate return on investments.

<P>

38   	It was also submitted on behalf of the defendants that
there was no evidence upon which Mr Griffiths was entitled to proceed
upon the
basis that the combined value of the group of entities was $3 million, that the
value to be attributed to Caddyrack Pty
Limited and Caddyrack International Pty
Limited at 25 September 1997 was $1,839,000, or that calculating the combined
value of those
two companies by deducting from the pre-tax profit a
proportionate cost of servicing stock and debtors in an amount of $60,000 and
then capitalising the balance of $735,748 at 40 percent was appropriate.
<P>

39   	The fourth major criticism addressed by the defendants to
the Griffiths report was that, upon the assumption that the capitalisation
of
future maintainable profits is an appropriate method of valuation in the
instant case, nevertheless the Griffiths report makes
a number of errors in the
application of that method. In particular, so it was submitted, the Griffiths
report make a determination
of real pre-tax profit for the business generated
from the golf club holder, as a consequence of a significant number of
add-backs
to profit. Most of those add-backs were, as it was submitted by the
defendant, totally inappropriate, and had the consequence of
artificially
inflating the Griffiths estimate of real pre-tax profit by a very large margin.

<P>

40   	The defendants also submitted that the calculations of Mr
Hewitt (being Attachment 9 to the Griffiths valuation) were defective
for a
number of reasons which are set forth in the submissions of Counsel. 
<P>

41   	In summary, it was submitted on behalf of the defendants
that the Griffiths report should be disregarded for the following
reasons;
<P>

(i)	The valuation purports to include in the valuation of shares of Caddyrack
Pty Limited a value for a whole range of unrelated
entities.
<P>

(ii)	A number of sources of information upon which the valuation is based are
unreliable.
<P>

(iii)	The valuation contains such a significant numbers of factual errors and
assumptions that any conclusions that it may reach
about the valuation of
shares in Caddyrack Pty Limited is fatally flawed;
<P>

(iv)	The respective qualifications of Mr Griffiths and Mr Pritchard entitling
them to offer opinion evidence concerning the valuation
of the shares in the
first defendant are such that, so it is submitted, Mr Pritchard's opinion
should be preferred to that of Mr
Griffiths, since Mr Pritchard, as the
accountant of Caddyrack Pty Limited and of Caddyrack International Pty Limited,
is better qualified
to comment on the value of the shares, because he is the
person best able to know the true state of the company's affairs.
<P>

42   	The report of Mr Pritchard was the subject of a number of
criticisms on behalf of the plaintiffs. Concerning the conclusion
drawn by Mr
Pritchard from the losses experienced by the first defendant in two of the last
three years of trading, to produce a
negative profit figure, and Mr Pritchard's
conclusion that, in consequence, there were no maintainable profits of the
first defendant,
Mr Griffiths said that such a method gave a distorted picture
of a company's earning capacity, because it failed to take into consideration
"start up" costs and "extraordinary expenditure" and the question of whether
the company's profitability was improving or deteriorating.
Mr Griffiths
offered by way of example three hypothetical companies. The first had earned
profits of $0, $50,000 and $100,000 in
three consecutive years; the second had
earned $50,000 for each of three years; and the final company had earned
$100,000, $50,000
and $0 in its last three years of trading. By adopting Mr
Pritchard's method (it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs) the
maintainable
profits would be the same for each of the three companies. Yet
clearly there is likely to be a considerable difference in the value
of those
three companies.
<P>

43   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that Mr
Pritchard did not explain upon what basis he claimed that this averaging
process gave a more reliable process of present earning capacity. 
<P>

44   	Mr Griffiths also pointed out that if the extraordinary
expenditure of $1.2 million was removed from the 1996 accounts, that
year would
have shown a net profit of over $500,000, rather than a loss.
<P>

45   	It was also emphasised in the submissions of the
plaintiffs that the chief difference between the net assets value technique
adopted by Mr Pritchard and the basis adopted by the plaintiffs was that Mr
Pritchard refused to allow anything for the goodwill
of the business, asserting
that this was not proper valuation methodology.
<P>

46   	The plaintiffs submitted that firstly Mr Pritchard had not
explained why goodwill should not be included as an asset of the
company.
Further, they relied upon the decision in <i>Re Golden Bread Pty Limited
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20Qd%20R%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] QR 44</a> at 61 - 62, where the trial judge had valued the principal
assets of a bakery company, namely the property at which the bakery business
was conducted and the goodwill of that business, on a going concern basis,
despite the unprofitability and insolvency of the company.
The Full Court of
the Supreme Court of Queensland (by majority) dismissed an appeal from that
decision and affirmed the approach
taken by the trial judge. 
<P>

47   	It seems to me that it is not appropriate to value only
the tangible assets, and disregard the intangible assets of a company
(as
appears to have been done by Mr Pritchard).
<P>

48   	Generally speaking, courts favour a two stage process in
determining the fair value of shares. That two stage process is briefly
explained by Fulton J in <i>Diligenti v RWMD Operations Kelowna Limited (No.
2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%204%20BCLR%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 4 BCLR 134</a> at 165 - 166.
<P>

49   	The first stage involves the determination of the value of
the company's assets (both tangible and intangible) and the value
of the
business carried on by company. The first stage actually involves the Court in
determining two separate issues, namely:
<P>

(i)	what method of valuation should be employed in determining the company's
worth in terms of assets and earning potential; and
<P>

(ii)	on what date should the valuation be treated as being made?
<P>

50   	In the instant case I do not need to concern myself with
the question of the date upon which the valuation should be treated
as being
made, since the date 25 September 1997 was designated by Mr Justice Young, in
order 3, as being the appropriate date from
which the shares are to be valued.

<P>

51   	The second stage involves the determination of the actual
price for the applicant's shares, which is based upon the applicant's
proportionate share of the company's total worth.
<P>

52   	I have already observed that valuations are not a matter
of exact science. To the extent that it is appropriate that I should
do so, it
seems to me that I should prefer the opinion evidence of Mr Griffiths to that
of Mr Pritchard. There are a number of reasons
for that preference. Firstly, on
the basis of experience and qualifications alone the evidence of Mr Griffiths
should be preferred
to that of Mr Pritchard (see <i>Kizquari Pty Limited v
Prestoo Pty Limited</i> (1993) 10 ACLSR 606 at 608; <i>Sapir v Sapir </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2013%20FamLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989)
13 FamLR 362</a> at 364. Further, it seems to me that the approach adopted by Mr
Griffiths towards the valuation was much more realistic than that
adopted by Mr
Pritchard. 
<P>

53   	I consider that it is here appropriate (despite the
criticisms of Mr Pritchard) to adopt the capitalisation of future maintainable
profits as the proper valuation method. I appreciate the opinion expressed by
Lonergan, <i>op. cit.</i>, 20, that this method should not be used where there
is a history of losses. However, where, as here, only three years of a
company's
activities are being considered, and in one of those years a profit
was made, whilst losses were made in the other two (and in one
of those other
two years the loss was the result of an extraordinary item, without which a
substantial profit would have resulted),
it is both inaccurate and misleading
to state that the company has a history of losses. In my view the valuation
method of future
maintainable profits adopted by Mr Griffiths is the
appropriate method of valuing the business of the first defendant, and the
adoption
of this method is not precluded by an asserted (but not substantiated)
history of losses.
<P>

54   	In approaching this valuation (not only the method of
valuation, but also the application of that method to the facts of the
instant
case), the Court should not lose sight of the fact that Mr Justice Young, in
ordering the buy-back and in directing the enquiry,
proceeded upon the basis
(at least implicit throughout his Honour's reasons for judgment) that the
subject shares were of some value,
indeed of a significant value, to the two
competing family interests which were the protagonists in the proceedings
before his Honour.
<P>

55   	To adopt the approach now advanced by the defendants (for
example, by asserting a lack of any legal entitlement to produce
the golf club
holder) seems to me to introduce into the enquiry a degree of artificiality
which is entirely inconsistent with the
manner in which the contested
proceedings were conducted before his Honour, and entirely inconsistent with
the underlying basis of
his Honour's decision and the reasons why his Honour
ordered a buy-back of the shares in the defendant.
<P>

56   	Further, reasons of practicality and common sense suggest
that the approach of Mr Pritchard was flawed by such matters as
his denial that
when valuing shares in a company it was necessary to value that company's
assets, or his assertion that in the instant
case he was required to value the
shares in the first defendant, not the underlying assets of the first
defendant. The denial that
the phrase "future maintainable earnings" was
equivalent to "goodwill" seemed to me to indicate a basic misunderstanding of
the concept
of goodwill. 
<P>

57   	The approach adopted by Mr Griffiths was far more
realistic and far less artificial than that adopted by Mr Pritchard.
<P>

58   	To approach the valuation of the shares in the first
defendant by disregarding the assets of the first defendant seems to
me to fly
in the face of reality and common sense. 
<P>

59   	Since the Drinkwater interests and Kyrwood interests in
the first defendant were equal, this is not a case where the principles
relating to what is sometimes referred to as a "minority discount" have
application (see Sirianos <i>op. cit., </i>113 - 115). 
<P>

60   	Accordingly, I summarise as follows my foregoing
conclusions. I regard the expertise and qualifications of Mr Griffiths as
preferable to those of Mr Pritchard. I prefer the approach of Mr Griffiths to
the valuation, rather than that of Mr Pritchard. In
my view Mr Pritchard's
approach totally disregarded the implicit basis upon which Mr Justice Young
considered that there should be
a buy-back of the shareholding of one of the
protagonist families in the first defendant by the other protagonist family.
One queries
whether the defendants would have propounded the expert evidence of
Mr Pritchard, if it had been the Drinkwaters who were purchasing
the interests
of the Kyrwoods in the first defendant. (I note that his Honour at page 33 of
his judgment of 25 September 1997 contemplated
that the short minutes to give
effect to his reasons for judgment should include an order that "within a
certain time after the publication
of the valuation the Drinkwaters (or perhaps
the Kyrwoods) be at liberty to purchase the opposing party's shares at that
valuation".)
<P>

61   	It follows from the conclusions which I have expressed
that each of the forty ordinary shares in Caddyrack Pty Limited should
be
valued at $41,495. 
<P>

62   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I certify the value of the shares in Caddyrack Pty Limited at $41,495 a
share.
<P>

2.	I express the view that the plaintiffs are entitled to have the fifth and
sixth defendants pay the costs of the plaintiffs of
the enquiry referred to in
order 6 of the orders made on 28 November 1997.
