<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	The Plaintiffs commenced these proceedings by seeking
interim injunctive relief by Summons dated 17 August 1999; the present
proceedings are now final.  That relief was to restrain the defendant Ian
Yates, who since December 1977 has been a director of each
of the Plaintiffs,
from stating, of the NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Ltd, "$50 million lost in
one transaction" or to similar
effect.  I shall refer for convenience to that
statement therefore as "the impugned statement".  The Plaintiffs' action was
prompted
by the Defendant's recent television and radio advertisements that
used that impugned statement to exemplify what he termed "great
waste and
mismanagement" of "the NRMA Board".  That in turn was used to justify change to
that Board in the current directorial elections
conducted by postal ballot, by
substituting a group of candidates from the Motorists' Action Group ("MAG").
The full text of the
relevant advertisement is conveniently contained in para
19 of the affidavit of Mr Richards of 17 August 1999 which I quote below:
<P>

"I was elected to the NRMA Board to protect your interests and since '97 I have
seen great waste and mismanagement -- $50 million
lost in one transaction.
That's why I believe it is time to change to the Board.  If you don't I expect
insurance premiums will increase,
vital road service will suffer, jobs will be
lost.  A well managed mutual will deliver you greater benefits.  Vote for all
MAG (Motorists'
Action Group) candidates.  MAG, the team you can trust."
<P>

2   	It is clear then that this advertisement is to campaign for
a change in the Board and election of the "MAG" group of directors,
who share
with Mr Yates a common view of the future commercial direction of the NRMA
group.  This case is <i>not</i> about the right of Mr Yates to pursue such a
campaign.  Rather it is whether in doing so, he has made a statement which was
materially
misleading and, if so, whether the Court can and should restrain
further publication of that impugned statement on a permanent basis.
<P>

3   	Significantly, Mr Yates in making the television broadcast
described himself in the words that flashed upon the screen briefly
at the
commencement as "a director of the NRMA".  In the advertisement, he describes
himself as "elected to the NRMA Board to protect
your interests".  There can be
no doubt that he made the impugned statement not merely as a private individual
or member, but professedly
as a director.
<P>

4   	The gravamen of the Plaintiffs' case is twofold:
<P>

(a)	the Defendant has in trade or commerce engaged in conduct which is
misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in
breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>"); and
<P>

(b)	the Defendant has breached his fiduciary duty as a director of the
Plaintiffs to act honestly and in the best interests of the
Plaintiffs.
<P>

5   	Inherent in the relief sought is the proposition that
further repetition of the impugned statement would result in breach of
either
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> or the Defendant's fiduciary duty as a director, or both.
<P>

6   	By consent but without admissions an interlocutory
injunction was granted for a very short time pending this hearing.  That
hearing, by agreement of the parties and with the co-operation of their legal
advisers, became a final hearing dealt with in a day.
 This met the Defendant's
concern for urgency, in that grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction
might in a practical sense
have determined the substance of the matter in
issue;  <i>Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 533</a>;
<i>Silktone Pty Limited v Devreal Capital Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 317.</a>
That was because the Defendant's advertisements would, according to the
Defendant, become rapidly less effective in influencing the
outcome of the
election of NRMA directors, as more NRMA members cast their postal votes.  By
promptly hearing the matter on a final
basis, it has not been necessary to
resolve that question.  
<P>

7   	The issue before me is whether a permanent injunction
should be granted in the same or similar terms to the interlocutory
injunction.
<P>

<b>RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES</b>
<P>

8   	The NRMA Group through both the parent company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary NRMA Investments have for many years held a substantial
parcel of shares built up in two companies, Washington Soul Pattinson &amp; Co
Limited.  It amounts to 7.5 per cent of Soul Pattinson's
issued capital and 8.4
per cent of Brickworks' issued capital.  Those companies in turn had cross
shareholdings in each other.  The
original holdings were accumulated over a
period commencing in 1984.  In the case of Soul Pattinson this was between 1984
and 1995
and in the case of Brickworks between 1984 and 1989.  
<P>

9   	The table below sets out what both parties agree to be the
values as recorded in the audited accounts firstly as at 30 June
1996, then as
at 30 June 1997 <i>before</i> adjustment in circumstances I later describe and
finally as at 30 June 1997 <i>after</i> adjustment as recommended by the NRMA's
internal investment analysts.  Those values can properly be called "carrying
values".  This
is in the accounting sense of "the amount at which an asset is
recorded in the accounting records at a particular date";  CCH Macquarie
Dictionary of Accounting" (Sydney, CCH 1991).  I set out that table (PX12)
below.

<P>

10   	These shares were valued in the accounts and general
ledgers in the first instance simply at their quoted price multiplied
by the
number of shares held, not at their lower historic cost of approximately $49
million for the two holdings.  But for the accounts
for the year ended 30 June
1997 an adjustment downwards was made.  The circumstances of that adjustment
are set out in an internal
memorandum dated 11 July 1997;  see Annexure C to Dr
Wall's affidavit of 16 August 1999.
<P>

11   	Essentially, the reason given for the adjustment was that
the quoted price of the shares in the two companies was considered
by NRMA's
investment analysts "given the extremely poor liquidity of both stocks and the
size of our holdings" as rendering it unlikely
that these values would be able
to be realised in the event of a sale.  However, the write down in value in the
accounts was of the
order of $37 million not $50 million.  Accordingly, that
write down, even if it were characterisable as a "transaction" which it
clearly
is not, could by itself not justify the impugned statement.  However, the
Defendant does not rely on that write down alone.
 Rather, he relies for one
basis of justification on that write down ($37 million) aggregated with the
later <i>realised</i> loss of approximately $14 million, as totalling $51
million in the following year.  I will call that approach the "aggregate
approach"
and will deal with it in 39 below.  His other basis is to equate
"loss" with the capital decline ($71 million approximately) he says
occurred in
the 18 months between the decision to sell and the actual sale:  I will call
that the "capital decline" approach and
deal with it in 12 below.
<P>

<b>The capital decline approach.</b>
<P>

12   	On 20 February 1997 the decision was made to attempt to
sell the shares in the two companies.  If at that time one simply
multiplied
the number of shares by their quoted price and ignored the earlier adjustment
for 30 June 1997, this would produce a figure
of $155.83 million;  (PX1 page
2).  In fact, for reasons anticipated by those who had made the earlier
adjustment and elaborated
in 14 below, the sale did not occur till 15 months
later, on 14 May 1998.  The sale price then realised was $84,555,279, some $71
million less than the earlier quoted price of $155.83 million.  This therefore
reflected a decline over 15 months of more than $50
million from that quoted
price.  This the Defendant contends, independently of the aggregate approach,
justifies the impugned statement.

<P>

13   	But there is a fundamental difficulty in the way of such a
conclusion.  First, "capital decline" is hardly an apt description
of a loss
derived from a "transaction" which implies a realised loss by way of sale.  But
even if it could be said that the later
sale on 14 May 1998 itself constituted
that "transaction", it is fallacious to say that this crystallised a loss
calculated by deducting
sale proceeds from the quoted value 15 months earlier,
being the date of the decision to sell (20 February 1997).  This is because
the
carrying value of the shares at 20 February 1997 was <i>not</i> their quoted
value or price.  That carrying value was the adjusted value as at 30 June 1997,
namely $100,622,182.35.  Hence any deduction
of the sale proceeds must
therefore be made from that adjusted value as it was the value in the accounts.
This yields a loss of $36,157,075,
not $50 million.  Indeed were profit or loss
to be determined by reference to historic cost rather than carrying value,
there would
in fact have been a profit of just under $14 million (Wall
affidavit, para 31).  Thus the capital decline sense of loss could not
be
sustained by reference either to the NRMA's accounts or historic cost. 
<P>

<b>The sale steps</b>
<P>

14   	Paragraph 23 of the affidavit of Dr Wall describes the
difficulties in effecting the sale of the shares which I set out below
as well
as the subsequent history leading to their eventual sale:
<P>

"23	Principally as a result of:
<P>

(a)	the illiquid market for the shares;
<P>

(b)	the high price of the shares in 1997;
<P>

(c)	the size of NRMA and NRMA Investments' shareholding in Soul Pattinson and
Brickworks compared to the total shareholdings of
Soul Pattinson and
Brickworks;
<P>

(d)	the need for confidentiality given that any action by NIMPL to publicise
the decision to sell could have caused a fall in the
share price of both stocks
(given the size of the parcels for sale); and
<P>

(e)	the desire to sell the shares in Soul Pattinson and Brickworks at the same
time (due to the extensive cross-shareholdings they
hold in each other),
<P>

the implementation of the decision to sell the shares was a difficult task.
<P>

24	As a result of the difficulties JB Were had in effecting the sale of the
shareholdings, Macquarie Equities Limited were approached
in or about September
1997 and were asked to attempt to identify a buyer.  However, their efforts
also failed to bring about a sale.
<P>

<b>Sale of shares in May 1998</b>
<P>

25	Between December 1997 and April 1998, the share price of both Soul Pattinson
and Brickworks fell significantly.
<P>

26	In about April 1998, a decision was then made taken jointly by myself, Ms
Doyle and Mr Dixon to ask NIMPL's equities dealer,
Mr Ben Ong, to explore other
options for selling the shares, even if they would be less confidential.
<P>

27	In late April or early May 1998, I recall that Mr Ong said to me words to
the following effect:
<P>

`I've asked ABN AMRO to work on it.  They are doing a due diligence on the
companies.'
<P>

28	On 14 May 1998, I was informed that ABN AMRO had found buyers for the Soul
Pattinson shares at $26.50 a share.  I cannot recall
whether I was informed of
this directly by Mr Ong, or by either Ms Doyle or Mr Dixon after they had
spoken to Mr Ong.  After discussing
the matter, Ms Doyle, Mr Dixon and I
decided to accept the deal for the sale of the Soul Pattinson shares.
<P>

29	Within an hour after the sale of the Soul Pattinson shares, I was informed
that ABN AMRO had also found buyers for the Brickworks
shares at a price of
$35.00 per share.  Again, I cannot recall whether I was informed of this
directly by Mr Ong, or by either Ms
Doyle or Mr Dixon after they had spoken to
Mr Ong.  After discussing the matter with Ms Doyle and Mr Dixon, it was decided
to accept
the deal for the sale of the Brickworks shares.
<P>

30	The sale of the shares was completed on 14 May 1998.  The Soul Pattinson
shares were sold at a price of $26.50 per share for
a total consideration of
$45,777,929.  The Brickworks shares were sold at a price of $35 per share for a
total consideration of $38,773,350."
<P>

15   	The end result was a realised sale price totalling
$84,555,279.
<P>

<b>What transaction -- Onus.</b>
<P>

16   	The relationship between the events concerning these two
companies culminating in the sale of the share parcels and the impugned
statement subsequently made on television, is not apparent from the bare
wording of that statement.  The reference to "transaction"
is totally at large.
 The Defendant contends that it is for the Plaintiffs to establish that they
have never made losses of $50 million
in any one transaction of whatever kind.
Yet Mr Yates readily acknowledged in evidence that he intended the statement to
refer to
the very transaction to which I have referred.  That indeed is
reinforced by a letter dated 12 February 1999 written by Mr Yate's
then
solicitor Brian Camilleri to the then Chief Executive Officer of the NRMA
Insurance Limited.  Unmistakeably, reference is made
to the events concerning
the shares in the two companies concerned.
<P>

17   	The Defendant contends that whatever may have been in the
mind of Mr Yates, what is relevant is the understanding of those
to whom the
television broadcast is directed.  Since they can be assumed to be primarily
potential voters in the forthcoming NRMA
directors' election to be declared on
6 October 1999 after the ballot closes, though no doubt others will hear the
broadcast, it
is their understanding that is primarily relevant.  They, it is
then contended, would not turn their mind to those share transactions.
<P>

18   	However that proposition ignores reality.  First, there
has been considerable newspaper publicity contemporaneously with the
current
proceedings identifying the share transaction.  If the advertisements were
allowed to be repeated, such publicity could be
expected to connect them to
this share transaction.  Looking at the matter prospectively, as one must in
considering whether to restrain
repetition of the impugned statement, there can
be little doubt that many of those who would hear future broadcasts would
readily
appreciate that it is this share transaction to which reference was
made.  That as Mr Yates concedes, was <i>his</i> intended meaning, though
conveyed in totally uninformative fashion.  It would be disingenuous therefore
to suppose that the many
future viewers with an interest in the NRMA's affairs
will be under any misapprehension that the advertisement relates to other than
the Soul Pattinson/Brickworks transaction.
<P>

19   	There is a further answer to this argument.  Mr Yates has
made the broadcast as a director of NRMA.  He is under an obligation
of a
fiduciary character not to provide information which he knows is wrong or
misleading and under a positive duty that if he does
provide information of an
advocatory kind, that it be not so incomplete as to be likely to mislead.  In
<i>Fraser &amp; Anor v NRMA Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d5%29%20127%20ALR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-5) 127 ALR 543</a> at 554 the
Full Federal Court said, in the context of directors' communication to a
shareholders' meeting, but no less applicable
to an individual director
speaking as such:
<P>

"A duty to make disclosure of relevant information arises as part of the
fiduciary duties of the directors to the company and its
members in relation to
proposals to be considered in general meeting and under s1022 of the Law in
respect of the contents of a prospectus.
 The fiduciary duty is a duty to
provide such material information as will fully and fairly inform members of
what is to be considered
at the meeting and for which their proxy may be
sought.  The information is to be such as will enable members to judge for
themselves
whether to attend the meeting and vote for or against the proposal
or whether to leave the matter to be determined by the majority
attending and
voting at the meeting ..."
<P>

20   	And at 466, the Full Federal Court identify the overlap
between <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> and the directors' fiduciary duty:
<P>

"Although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> gives rise to no duty to provide information, when information is
in fact given in purported discharge of the fiduciary duty, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> requires that
the information given is not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or
deceive.  Additionally, the section requires
that the conduct of the directors
in withholding certain information is not itself conduct which is misleading or
deceptive or likely
to mislead or deceive.  It is in the area of the proper
discharge of the fiduciary duty to provide relevant information that there
is
an overlap between discharge of the duty and the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52:</a>  a failure
properly to discharge the duty may itself constitute a contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> as
well as a contravention of s995 of the Law."
<P>

21   	Without at this point deciding whether that information
was in fact wrong or misleading, assume that it were.  He as a director
would
then be propagating information about a $50 million loss when he knows of no
transaction other than this one to which the loss
relates but yet he fails to
identify it.  Assuming it to be misleading, if this transaction were the one in
mind, that precludes
him from purveying it.  Mr Yates can hardly expect the
NRMA to establish there was no <i>other</i> transaction to which it could
relate, when Mr Yates well knows that the allegation of loss was intended to
fit this transaction,
and this one alone.  It is not for the Plaintiffs in
effect to have to say when they stopped beating their grandmothers when the
Defendant knows of no beating other than this one -- and that this one was not
a beating at all, if one assumes the statement to
be misleading.  
<P>

22   	To refer to a "transaction" without specifying which one,
is in this context of a communication by someone professedly acting
as a
director and directed principally at NRMA members, itself misleading.  This
misleading character derives from the suggestion
that there could be any other
transaction than these two share sales, when the speaker has no others in mind
and is a director with
the fiduciary duty I have described.  In effect he says:
"if the cap fits, wear it", but I won't tell you the critical dimensions
of the
cap.  It is of course well settled that one can be misleading by silence in the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> context;  see for example <i>Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins
Marrickville Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2079%20ALR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 79 ALR 83</a> at 95 per Lockhart J:
<P>

"At common law, silence can give rise to an actionable misrepresentation where
there is a duty upon the representor to reveal a
matter if it exists, and where
the other party is therefore entitled to infer that matter does not exist from
the silence of the
representor ... The circumstances in which silence may
constitute misleading conduct under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> were referred to in
<i>Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2012%20FCR%20477" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 12
FCR 477.</a>  That case established that silence may be relied on in order to show
a breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> when the circumstances give rise to an obligation to disclose
relevant facts ... The duty to disclose is not confined to cases where
there
are particular relationships, such as trustee and beneficiary or solicitor and
client, principal and agent and guardian and
ward.  There is no useful purpose
in seeking to analyse the circumstances in which the duty to disclose will
arise as this must depend
on the facts of each case."
<P>

23   	The same reasoning must apply to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> assuming
it otherwise were capable of applying.  I therefore would conclude that in the
circumstances, the Defendant's failure to
disclose which transaction he meant
would itself be misleading on the assumption I have made.  It is therefore
certainly not for
the Plaintiffs to have to demonstrate no other transaction
would fit the imputation of a $50 million loss from one transaction.
<P>

<b>In Trade or Commerce?</b>
<P>

24   	I turn now to the next question;  whether the impugned
statement is capable of being misleading or deceptive, within the statutory
ambit of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  That depends on whether the impugned statement is
made in trade or commerce as those terms are defined in that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a>
is in these terms:
<P>

"<b>42	Misleading or deceptive conduct</b> (TPA <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52)</a>
<P>

(1)	A person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is
misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
<P>

(2)	Nothing in this Part shall be taken as limiting by implication the
generality of subsection (1)"
<P>

25   	The terms "trade or commerce" are themselves defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s4</a>
of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and I quote below the relevant definitions.
<P>

"<b>trade or commerce</b> includes any business or professional activity."
<P>

26   	The Defendant's contention is that as the word "business"
necessarily connotes "trade, commercial transactions or engagement"
(<i>Fasold
v Roberts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=145%20ALR%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">145 ALR 548</a> at 588).  Then, it is argued that because it is not
possible to find any trade, commercial transactions or engagement in the
activities
of Mr Yates, he could not be caught by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> even were the statement
misleading or deceptive. 
<P>

27   	The meaning of similar language in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</i> 1974</a> (Cth) has been settled by the High Court in <i>Concrete
Constructions (N.S.W.) Pty Ltd v Nelson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 594</a> in the majority
judgment at 603:
<P>

"What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards
persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it (or
those whose interests it
represents or is seeking to promote) has or may have dealings in the course of
those activities or transactions
which, of their nature, bear a trading or
commercial character."
<P>

28   	Earlier, the majority made clear that they are referring
to the "central conception" of trade and commerce, not the "immense
field of
activities" in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the
purpose of carrying on some overall trading or
commercial business.
<P>

29   	The question then is whether Mr Yate's activities come
within that central conception of trade or commerce.  Importantly,
we are not
here concerned with whether Mr Yates carries out the conduct in question in
connection with his own business.  As was
said by Hedigan J in <i>Meadow Gem
Pty Ltd v ANZ Executors &amp; Trustees Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20ATPR%20%28Digest%29%2046%2d130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) ATPR (Digest) 46-130</a>
and approved by Sackville J in <i>Fasold</i> (supra) at 593 that is not
necessary:
<P>

"the conduct in question does not have to be conduct in connection with one's
own business, and that it would be sufficient if the
conduct engaged in was for
the purpose of promoting the business of some other person or corporation."
<P>

30   	The earlier quoted ratio from <i>Concrete
Constructions</i> (supra) itself extends the conduct capable of being caught to
include <i>promotive</i> conduct.
<P>

31   	However, that first person's promotive conduct must be
sufficiently connected to the trade or commerce of the second person
or
corporation whose business is thereby promoted if it is to constitute trade or
commerce in that central sense.  The centrality
of Mr Yates' connection with
the NRMA and its business is derived both from his speaking as a director and
his purpose in so doing.
 His purpose is clearly to promote a campaign for the
election of like-minded directors of the NRMA in order to avoid the
consequences
flowing from "great waste and mismanagement" identified in the
advertisement;  that is to say, to influence the future trade and
commerce of
the NRMA via change to its corporate governance.
<P>

32   	The conclusion that his impugned statement is in trade or
commerce of the NRMA's is strongly reinforced by the fact that he
makes the
relevant statement professedly <i>as a director</i> in connection with NRMA's
future corporate governance and strategic direction.  That he does so as an
individual director can make
no difference more especially as describes his
role as one "elected to the NRMA board to protect your interests".  That
equates him
in trade or commerce to the directors collectively of a corporation
sending a memorandum to shareholders in relation to a proposed
acquisition to
be considered by shareholders at a general meeting of the corporation, itself
held to be conduct in trade or commerce;
 <i>Orison Pty Ltd v Strategic
Minerals Corporation NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2077%20ALR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 77 ALR 141..</a>  
<P>

33   	The intention of Mr Yates, by a campaign of paid
advertising, itself a commercial activity, is thus to promote the interests
as
he sees them of the NRMA group of companies and in particular their business.

<P>

34   	That the statement made by Mr Yates as a director is
related to the candidature of directors in a contested election and thus
also
relates to the corporate governance of the NRMA, itself may suffice without
more to bring the statement within the central conception
of trade or commerce,
though I do not need to determine that.  However, were anyone <i>not</i>
connected with the corporation to make a statement about a loss said to have
been incurred by a trading corporation that may or may
not be enough of itself
to place the impugned statement in trade or commerce;  again I do not have to
decide that. 
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

35   	I am satisfied that Mr Yates' advertising campaign is
capable of coming within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a>, as being in trade or commerce as there
defined.
<P>

<b>Director's fiduciary duty breached?</b>
<P>

36   	Were I wrong in that conclusion, the Plaintiffs' case is
also put on the basis that the Mr Yates has breached his fiduciary
duty
avowedly acting as a director of the Plaintiffs to act honestly and in the best
interests of the Plaintiffs.  If that contention
were made out, there is no
necessity to demonstrate that the relevant activity occurs in trade and
commerce.
<P>

37   	It was not put in cross-examination to Mr Yates that he
had failed to act honestly, nor in terms which identified all of the
elements
establishing dishonesty such as those of deliberate intent to mislead.  Nor was
it put that he had in the past failed to
act as he saw it in the best interests
of the Plaintiffs.  However, the problem for the future lies in whether such an
advertisement
could be propagated if it were now finally determined by this
Court that it was misleading and deceptive.  Whatever may be said about
the
past about honest belief, once such a judgment were made that the impugned
statement was misleading, it could not be other than
a breach of a director's
fiduciary duty of honesty to continue to propagate such a statement.  It is to
that question I now turn.
<P>

<b>Misleading or deceptive?</b>
<P>

38   	The Defendant acknowledged that if the transactions be
those to which I have earlier referred, then the statement that the
NRMA "lost
$50 million in one transaction" could only be justified on one of two bases.
The first capital decline approach is that
the circumstances demonstrate a
capital decline in the book value of the relevant shares of at least $50
million.  That could not
be justified, for the reasons already stated in paras
12 and 13 above.  
<P>

<b>The aggregate approach</b>
<P>

39   	The second basis, the aggregate approach, is set out in
para 3.4 of the Defendant's written submissions which I quote below:
<P>

"3.4	It may be inferred from material which is available to the Court, but
which would not be available to a viewer of the advertisement,
that the loss
being referred to by Mr Yates was the "capital decline" suffered between the
time the plaintiffs resolved to sell the
shares and the time of sale.  This is
a concept which the plaintiffs themselves seem to embrace in the report
prepared for the board
meeting on 20 February 1997 (see: Wall, CW1, p 41.3).
If the actual capital decline is calculated from the report of 13 February
1999, it amounts to $71.3 million.  This seems to have been readily understood
to be a loss by the journalist of the Sydney Morning
Herald article on 18
August 1999:  "How the NRMA blew $71 million" (Yates, p.43).  Even if it is
approached on the book profits and
losses, the write-down in June 1997 was from
$47.50 to $35.00 for Soul Pattinson and from $48.00 to $35.00 for Brickworks:
Wall,
p 14.  Therefore, on the 1,788,509 Soul Pattinson shares there was a book
loss of $22.4 million and on the 1,102,310 Brickwork shares
there was a book
loss of $14.3 million as at year end 30 June 1997 as a result of the
write-down.  When these book losses for the
year ended 30 June 1997 are added
to the book losses of $13.9 million for the year ended 30 June 1998, the book
losses recorded on
the shares from the time the plaintiffs resolved to sell on
20 February 1997 to the time they sold on 14 May 1998, were $50.6 million.
What is it about the statement "fifty million lost on one transaction" which
prevents it from bearing this meaning?  More correctly,
how have the plaintiffs
proven that the statement was misleading or deceptive when the criteria for
calculating the loss were not
specified by Mr Yates in his statement and the
loss he gives can be supported on a reasonable basis?"
<P>

40   	The aggregate approach, ingenious as it is, can be summed
up this way.  As between 30 June 1996 and 30 June 1997, as a result
of the
adjustment down in carrying values, there was an unrealised book loss of $36.7
million.  To that is to be added the transaction
of sale which occurred in the
next financial year on 14 May 1998.  That yielded what the Defendant describes
as a further loss of
$13.9 million for the year ended 30 June 1998.  When these
two losses, so called, are aggregated ($36.7 million from year one, unrealised
and $13.9 million from year two, realised) they produce an aggregate loss as at
the time the shares were sold on 14 May 1998 of $56
million.  It will be seen
that only the latter involved a transaction, itself sufficient to preclude that
justification.
<P>

41   	Moreover such reasoning involves the fallacy of adding an
unrealised book loss from a previous year to a realised book loss
in a
subsequent year.  This is to confuse realised and unrealised losses, and this
when the term "transaction" clearly enough refers
to realised losses only.
Even were unrealised losses capable of being taken into account as part of an
overall transaction culminating
in sale, there is no basis for aggregating an
unrealised loss from a previous year of income to a realised loss of a later
year of
income.  Conventional accounting strikes a profit year by year, in the
case of capital profits;  likewise for capital losses.  That
aggregate approach
therefore could not be justified on any rational system of accounting.
<P>

42   	Those who view television advertisements are not trained
accountants.  But, even if they had such sophistication, they would
be misled,
for by no rational system of accounting did these transactions generate a loss
of $50 million.  To the lay viewer, a loss
realised is what the quoted words
connote -- realised by an actual transaction.  To a layman, the transaction of
sale compared to
historic cost could also be what he or she might have in mind.
But that, as is clear, would have yielded not a loss but a profit
and in any
event that appears not how the Plaintiffs' recorded the relevant transaction in
their books, in calculating profit or
loss.  The intermediate adjustments in
carrying value over the period that the shares have been held going back to
1984 can be viewed
as a creature of the fluctuating stock market price with the
1997 adjustment to reflect the practical difficulty later experienced
of
disposing of so large a parcel.  All such adjustments in carrying value were
unrealised and thus not to be described as a "transaction".
 One only has to
ask what would happen if directors were to announce a profit based upon the
converse circumstances.  That is, aggregating
an unrealised profit in carrying
values from an earlier year of income to a realised profit of a later year, and
then calling the
result a "profit" from a "transaction".  That would be just as
misleading.
<P>

<b><i>Overall Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

43   	Accordingly, I conclude that the statement, if repeated,
would be both misleading and deceptive in terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act</a></i> and a breach of Mr Yate's fiduciary duties.
<P>

<b>Remaining Issues -- Delay, s232A of the <i>Corporations Law</i> and balance
of convenience.</b>
<P>

44   	It remains briefly to consider the question of delay.
Also the question of whether the directors of the NRMA who voted to
commence
these proceedings were interested such as to render their participation in the
directors' meeting void under s232A of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

45   	The issue of delay has no substance.  The board when
apprised of the first of the television advertisements made on 11 August
1999
met on 13 August, a Friday and the relevant summons was filed on 17 August 1999
four days later.
<P>

46   	While Mr Yates was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald of
10 November 1998 that provision of certain documents "will help
me understand
better my concerns as to how a $50 million loss on the shares was made",  that
was hardly a basis for injunctive proceedings,
quite apart from their
preclusion by the exemption for printed matter in s60 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

47   	As to the directors who voted for the resolution to
commence this action being interested, within s232A of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>, that turns upon whether they would be precluded from voting because
they themselves were standing for election in the upcoming elections
in the
case of three of them leaving no quorum.  The short answer to that proposition
is that if, as I have determined, they were
simply ensuring that members were
not deceived or misled, by material in support of the so-called MAG directors,
they could hardly
be said to advancing their own cause in the forthcoming
election.  To suppose otherwise is to assume that the MAG directors would
have
a vested interest in misleading and deceptive material being propagated.  That
is not a view of the MAG directors that has been
advanced by any party in this
Court.
<P>

48   	Finally, it is clear that any balance of convenience
issues clearly favour the Plaintiffs.  There is nothing to stop the Defendant
continuing his campaign, but not in a way to mislead or deceive or so as to
contravene his duties as a director.  If he has to scrap
and pay for new
television advertisements, that is the result of his own conduct.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

49   	By way of final relief, and on the basis that the
Plaintiffs no longer give any undertaking as to damages, the Defendant is
restrained by himself, his servants or agents from publishing or authorising
the publication of any statement to the effect that
the Plaintiffs or either of
them have lost $50 million in one transaction, namely the sale of their
respective shareholding interests
held directly or indirectly in Washington H
Soul Pattinson &amp; Company Limited and Brickworks Limited, or any statements
to the
like effect.
<P>

50   	I further order that the Defendant is to pay the
Plaintiffs' costs of these proceedings including all reserved costs.
