<P>

<b><u>THURSDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 1999</u></b>

<b><u>13712/95  -  WAH LAI INVESTMENT (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED  v  BUDDIES
LIQUOR PTY LIMITED &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  These are two applications brought by way of Notice of
Motion by Craftmill Pty Ltd which was not a party to the original
proceedings.
<P>

2	The original proceedings resulted in a consent judgment giving rise to orders
for possession entered by consent in this Court
on 17 April 1996.
<P>

3	The premises which were the subject of the original proceedings (and the
subject of these proceedings) came back into the possession
of the plaintiff
(hereinafter referred to as Wah Lai) by dint of the Sheriff executing a writ of
possession on 14 May 1996.
<P>

4	The Notice of Motion seeks twofold relief. First, the applicant company seeks
to have the judgment of 17 April 1996 set aside.
Second, if the judgment be set
aside then the applicant seeks to be joined as a defendant in the reopened
proceedings.
<P>

5	An identical application was brought by Paul Vella, the sole director and
shareholder of the applicant company before Sully J.
<P>

6	On 29 January 1998 his Honour dismissed Mr Vella's motion. In essence his
Honour held that Mr Vella's application was misconceived
because at the
relevant time Mr Vella was not an occupier of the subject premises and thus had
no standing in the matter.
<P>

7	In these proceedings all parties accepted not only that his Honour's
conclusion was correct but so also were the findings of fact
made by his Honour
in founding his conclusion of law. The proceedings before Sully J were, like
the present proceedings, interlocutory
in nature and in the normal course do
not result in final findings of fact. Furthermore, both parties submitted
evidence which had
been before Sully J and other courts involved in this
litigious exercise.
<P>

8	In making the findings which he did his Honour as far as it was relevant to
the applicant then before him, recounted the history
of the plethora of
proceedings brought before this Court in various Divisions involving the
parties to this Motion. Again, the parties
in these proceedings accept his
Honour's analysis as being correct.
<P>

9	Accordingly for the purposes of these reasons I incorporate Sully J's
findings of fact so far as they relate to the matters raised
here.
<P>

10	His Honour's findings were as follows:
<P>

11	"There are before the Court for adjudication two Notices of Motion. In order
to deal with them, it is necessary to consider the
relevant procedural
background, which is as follows. There are pending in the Court two sets of
principal proceedings, one in the
Common Law Division, and the other in the
Equity Division. The proceedings in the Equity Division commenced with the
filing in 1996
of a Statement of Claim in which the plaintiff is Mr. Paul
Vella. There are two defendants: the first being Wah Lai Investment (Australia)
Pty Ltd., (Wah Lai); and the second being the Registrar General of this State.
The proceedings concern premises situated at 1-3 Botany
Road, Waterloo, being
hotel premises known as "The Waterloo Tavern", (the subject premises). The
proceedings seek various forms of
relief in respect of a Transfer of Lease from
Wah Lai to Mr. Vella.
<P>

12	It is not necessary for present purposes to be concerned further with the
fine detail of the proceedings in the Equity Division.
It is sufficient to
understand that they were mentioned before Windeyer J on 13 December 1996, when
his Honour, who had been asked
to order an expedited hearing of the proceedings
in the Equity Division, expressed the view that it was not expedient to do so
until
the principal proceedings in the Common Law Division had been determined;
and, more particularly, until it should have been determined
whether or not a
judgment for possession obtained by Wah Lai in respect of the subject premises
should be set aside.
<P>

13	The principal proceedings in the Common Law Division have followed, broadly
speaking, the following course:
<P>

(1)	<i>On 29 September 1995</i> Wah Lai instituted proceedings by way of a
statement of liquidated claim. There were two defendants thus sued. The first
of them
was a company styled Buddies Liquor Pty Limited, (Buddies Liquor); and
the second of them was an individual, Mr. Nelson Meers. Wah
Lai sues as
registered proprietor of the subject premises; and as lessor of the subject
premises to Buddies Liquor, pursuant to a
lease said to have commenced on 25
March 1993 and to be due to expire on 24 March 2003.
<P>

(2)	The statement of claim alleges against Buddies Liquor various breaches of
the lease, both as to the payment of rent and otherwise.
The statement of claim
alleges against Mr. Meers that he was, pursuant to Clause 26 of the lease, the
guarantor of the obligations
of Buddies Liquor under the lease, and liable,
therefore, to Wah Lai for payment of the obligations of Buddies Liquor pursuant
to
the lease.
<P>

(3)	The precise claims for relief made in the Statement of Claim are as
follows:
<P>

(a)	Money due and owing by Buddies Liquor and by Mr. Meers to Wah Lai for rent,
for increases in rent, and for other outgoings calculated
to 25 September 1995
in the sum of $36,776.
<P>

(b)	Loss and damages suffered by Wah Lai.
<P>

(c)	Judgment for possession of the subject premises.
<P>

(d)	Leave to issue a writ for possession of the subject premises by way of
enforcement of such judgment for possession.
<P>

	(e)	An order that Wah Lai is at liberty to forfeit and to terminate the
lease.
<P>

	(f)	Costs.
<P>

	(g)	Statutory interest.
<P>

	(h)	Such other order(s) as the Court might think fit.
<P>

(4)	<i>On 21 February 1996</i> Buddies Liquor and Mr. Meers filed a joint
defence. Put simply, it traverses every material allegation made in the
statement of claim,
except for the fact of the registered proprietorship of Wah
Lai of the subject premises; and except for the fact of the grant of
a lease as
pleaded in the statement of claim, both of which latter allegations are
admitted. 
<P>

14	<i>On 17 April 1996</i> consent orders were filed. The orders grant Wah Lai
possession of the subject premises; direct judgment for possession accordingly;
grant leave to Wah Lai to issue a writ of possession in respect of the subject
premises, and note the following:
<P>

	"The Defendant be given the opportunity to attend and be consulted in respect
of any agreement or resolution between the Plaintiff
and any Third Party
regarding resolution of the issues giving rise to these proceedings or the
proceedings themselves."
<P>

15	The Common Law Division file contains two documents, each of which is
described as a "Minute of Judgment". The two documents
are identical except for
certain hand-written amendments to one of them, those amendments being formal
rather than substantive. According
to the date stamps imprinted on the
documents, one was filed on <i>14 February 1996</i> and the other on <i>29
February 1996</i>. Each document purports to minute a judgment in the following
terms:
<P>

	"1.	The defendant give the plaintiff possession of the land described in the
schedule hereunder.
<P>

2.	The defendant pay the plaintiff arrears of rent and outgoings being
$71,913.
<P>

3.	The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs and disbursements (filing fees) in
the sum of $1,745.
<P>

4.	The judgment takes effect on the        day of         1996."
<P>

The schedule referred to describes the subject premises.
<P>

16	On 29 <i>April 1996</i> the Court granted leave to Wah Lai to issue a write
of possession. A writ of possession issued on that same day. The writ refers
to
a judgment said to have been entered on <i>17 April 1996</i>; and it commands
the sheriff to put Wah Lai into possession of the subject premises. 
<P>

17	It appears from the Common Law Division file that on <i>15 February 1996</i>
a draft writ of possession was filed. This document leaves blank the date of
the judgment pursuant to which it purports to be filed;
and it purports to
command the Sheriff, not only to put Wah Lai into possession of the subject
premises, but to levy on the property
of Buddies Liquor in satisfaction of a
judgment debt of $73,658 said to result from a judgment, the date of which,
also, is left
blank in the document.
<P>

18	On 20 May 1996 Buddies Liquor and Mr. Meers filed jointly a Notice of Motion
seeking orders that they be granted leave to make
a cross-claim against Mr.
Vella whose address is given as 16 Terrace Road, Dulwich Hill. This Notice of
Motion was made returnable,
initially, for <i>30 May 1996</i>. According to the
Common Law Division file, it was stood over generally on that day with liberty
to restore on 7 days' notice. The
Notice of Motion does not seem ever to have
been restored.
<P>

19	On <i>14 April 1996 </i>there was a status conference held in connection
with the Common Law Division proceedings. Orders for the issue of a writ of
possession
were confirmed by the Registrar and an order was made that the
defendants in the Common Law proceedings, that is to say Buddies Liquor
and Mr.
Meers, give discovery as to the remaining issues to be determined in the Common
Law proceedings, that is to say the issues
of unpaid rent, damages and the like
claims.
<P>

20	On <i>29 April 1996 </i>a writ of possession issued.
<P>

21	On <i>6 May 1996 </i>the Sheriff issued the customary Notice to Vacate. The
notice, a copy of which is Annexure P to an affidavit sworn by Mr. Vella on
2
August 1996, is addressed to Buddies Liquor and to Mr. Meers. The notice warns
"all occupants" that they "must vacate the premises
without delay - in any
event not later than 10.30 a.m. Tuesday 14/5/96".
<P>

22	<i>On 14 May 1996 </i>the Sheriff duly took possession of the subject
premises.
<P>

23	It is the foregoing procedural history that gives rise to the two notices of
motion now before this Court. 
<P>

24	The first of those notices of motion is that of Mr. Paul Vella. The notice
of motion was filed on 28 November 1996, and it seeks
the following relief:
<P>

	"1.	Pursuant to Part 40 Rule 9(2)(C), that judgment for possession obtained on
17th April 1996, be set aside.
<P>

<i>	2.	Pursuant to Part 8 Rule 8(3), that the Applicant, Paul Vella be added as
a Defendant in these proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	That this Notice of Motion be heard together with proceedings No. 2907
of 1996 in this Court, which proceedings have been expedited.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	That evidence in proceedings no. 2907 of 1996 be evidence on this
Motion.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	That Paul Vella have leave to cross claim against the first and second
defendants for such relief as he may be advised within
21 days of the hearing
and determination of this Notice of Motion.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	Costs.</i>
<P>

	<i>7.	Further or other order."</i>
<P>

25	On 19 September 1997, and after the hearing of Mr. Vella's notice of motion
had begun and had continued for some time, Wah Lai
moved on notice for the
following relief:
<P>

	"1.	That this Notice of Motion be returnable instanter.
<P>

	2.	That service of Notice of Occupier upon Mr. Paul Vella personally pursuant
to Pt 7 r8 of the Rules be dispensed with nonc (sic)
pro tunc.
<P>

	3.	Further or other orders.
<P>

	4.	Cost."
<P>

26	Fundamental to the claims for relief now made by Mr. Vella are three in
particular of the Supreme Court Rules, namely Pt 7, Rule
8; Pt 8, Rule 9; and
Pt 40, Rule 9(2)(c).
<P>

27	SCR Pt 7, Rule 8 is in the following terms:
<P>

	"8(1)	Where, on the date on which proceedings for possession of land are
commenced, a person (in this Rule called the occupier)
not joined as a
defendant is in occupation of the whole or any part of the land, the plaintiff
shall either -
<P>

	(a)	state in the originating process that he does not disturb the occupation
of the occupier or
<P>

	(b)	serve the originating process on the occupier together with a notice that
the occupier may apply to the Court for an order
that the occupier be added as
a defendant and that, if the occupier does not so apply within 10 days after
service, the occupier
may be evicted pursuant to a judgment entered in the
occupier's absence.
<P>

	(2)	Documents may be served on an occupier for the purposes of sub-Rule (1)
personally or by leaving the documents on the land
in his occupation addressed
to him by name or addressed to `the occupier'."
<P>

28	SCR Pt 8, Rule 8 is as follows:
<P>

	"8(1)	Where a person who is not a party -
<P>

	(a) ought to have been joined as a party; or 
<P>

	(b)	is a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all
matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually
and completely
determined and adjudicated upon, 
<P>

	the Court, on application by him or by any party or of its own motion, may
order that he be added as a party and make orders for
the further conduct of
the proceedings.
<P>

	(2)	A person shall not be added as a plaintiff without his consent.
<P>

	(3)	Without limiting the generality of sub-Rule (1), where a person not a
party to proceedings for possession of land is in possession
(by himself or by
a tenant of the whole or any part of the land, the Court, on application by
him, may order that he be added as
a defendant and make orders for the further
conduct of the proceedings."
<P>

29	SCR Pt 40, Rule 9(2) provides, so far as is now relevant, as follows:
<P>

	"9(2)	The Court may set aside or vary a judgment - 
<P>

	...
<P>

	(c)	where the judgment has been entered in proceedings for possession of land
after judgment has been given in the absence of a
person and the Court decides
to make an order that the person be added as a defendant."
<P>

30	Mr. Vella's starting point in his submissions is a simple proposition, to
the truth of which he deposes in the first paragraph
of an affidavit sworn by
him on 2 August 1996 in the Equity Division proceedings, that between July 1994
and 14 May 1996, he carried
on business at the subject premises. I would say at
once that, in my opinion, the whole of the evidence now before this Court could
not reasonably support a finding of fact to that effect.
<P>

31	It is much more difficult to disentangle the evidence which has been placed
before this Court, and to draw out of that evidence
a true picture of the
course of events concerning Mr. Vella's connection with the subject premises. I
am satisfied, however, of the
following matters:
<P>

1.	That as at 7 March 1994, Buddies Liquor was the lessee from Wah Lai as
lessor of the subject premises. The lease was registered
pursuant to the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> (NSW) on 14 April 1993. The lease was
for a term of 10 years commencing on 25 March 1993. The covenants in the lease
required, so
far as is at present material, that the subject premises not be
used otherwise than as  a hotel; and that the lessee should not assign
or in
any other way part with or share possession of the subject premises or any part
of them, save with the prior written consent
of the lessor, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld.
<P>

2.	That Mr. Nelson Meers was, put shortly, at all material times the guarantor
to Wah Lai of the due performance by Buddies Liquor
of its obligations pursuant
to such lease.
<P>

3.	That on 7 March 1994 and by an agreement in writing bearing that date,
Buddies Liquor agreed to sell to Mr. Vella the lease and
business of the
subject premises. The purchase price was $105,000, the whole of which was
specifically attributed to the hotel lease
and to the good will of the hotel
business then being carried on upon the subject premises.
<P>

4.	That this transaction was settled formally, as between Buddies Liquor and
Mr. Meers on the one hand, and Mr. Vella on the other,
on 20 July 1994.
<P>

5.	That a formal Transfer of Lease was executed by Buddies Liquor and Mr. Meers
on the one hand, and by Mr. Vella on the other hand;
but that for some
unexplained reason it was never lodged for registration until, according to Mr.
Vella, he found the document among
his papers on 31 July 1996, and caused it to
be lodged for registration on that same day.
<P>

6.	That almost immediately after such formal settlement on 20 July 1994, Mr.
Vella entered into possession of, and took up the formal
occupation of, the
subject premises. He did so in company with his de facto wife, Miss Koleta
Gleeson, who became, effectively, the
day-to-day manager of the hotel
business.
<P>

7.	That such entry into possession and taking up of occupation of the subject
premises by Mr. Vella was known to Wah Lai; and that
thereafter various
payments were made by Mr. Vella to Wah Lai on account of rent and other
outgoings due pursuant to the covenants
in the lease; and that such payments
were accepted by Wah Lai. I note that Wah Lai, in its pleadings in the Equity
Division proceedings,
seeks to keep open its option to argue that its receipt
and acceptance of such payments constituted an acceptance of payments made
for
and on behalf of Buddies Liquor rather than for an on behalf of Mr. Vella
himself in any formal capacity as transferee of the
lease to Buddies Liquor.
The important point for present purposes is, however, that the payments were
made by Mr. Vella and not by
Buddies Liquor, and were well known to Wah Lai to
have been so made.
<P>

8.	That Mr. Vella, at or about the time of his entering into possession and
occupation of the subject premises, obtained a provisional
hotelier's licence
from the relevant liquor licensing authorities.
<P>

9.	That Mr. Vella's necessary application to have that provisional licence
converted into a full current licence ran into serious
difficulties by reason
of objections raised by the licensing police and by the Chief Secretary.
<P>

10.	That, since it was essential to the continuing conduct of the hotel
business then being carried on at the subject premises,
that there should be in
force a full and current hotelier's licence, Mr. Vella arranged for a company
called Craftmill Pty Ltd and
Koleta Gleeson to apply for such a permanent
licence.
<P>

32	Craftmill Pty Ltd had been incorporated on 2 November 1993. On 11 November
1993, Mr. Vella's son and Koleta Gleeson were appointed
as directors of the
company; and Mr. Vella's son was appointed as its secretary.
<P>

33	The documentation respecting Miss Gleeson's application for the permanent
licence comprises Exhibit E in the instant proceedings.
Of particular relevance
for present purposes are the following statements made in the application
documents. It is to be noted that
they are all verified on oath by Miss
Gleeson; and that she re-affirmed in her oral evidence in the present
interlocutory applications
the truth of the statements.
<P>

a.	The proposed owner of the licence is Buddies Liquor Store Pty Limited.
<P>

b.	$100,000 has been paid for the purchase of the business conducted pursuant
to the licence.
<P>

c.	Of that amount of $100,000, $5,000 has been provided by Craftmill Pty Ltd
and $95,000 by Buddies Liquor as "vendor finance".
<P>

d.	That she herself will hold the licence as Manager.
<P>

e.	That Craftmill Pty Ltd will be the only person "directly or indirectly
interested in the business or the profits of the business
carried on pursuant
to the licence".
<P>

f.	That, as to the proprietorship of the freehold of the licensed premises: Wah
Lai is the owner and the lessor; Buddies Liquor
is the sub-lessor; Craftmill
Pty Ltd is lessee; that there are no co-lessees; that Wah Lai will be entitled
to the rents of the premises;
and that Craftmill Pty Ltd will be entitled to
the profits of the business."
<P>

34	Again, the three rules of court to which his Honour made reference in his
reasons are again the subject of agreement by the parties
to be the relevant
rules involved in this application.
<P>

35	Essentially, what is put is that Craftmill was in fact, as his Honour found,
the occupier at the relevant time and not Mr Vella.
<P>

36	There being no real issue that this is the fact it follows that Craftmill is
entitled to make an application pursuant to SCR
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p8" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 8</a> r 8 that it be joined as a
party to the proceedings - provided of course that the judgment of 17 April
1996 is set aside.
<P>

37	Following the interlocutory judgment of Sully J further litigation occurred
in this Court and indeed the High Court between the
parties.
<P>

38	On 24 March 1998 Wah Lai made an application to Bryson J in Equity seeking
that an injunction which had been granted by consent
on 22 August 1996
restraining the Registrar-General from taking steps to remove the lease granted
by Wah Lai to Buddies Liquor from
the title be dissolved.
<P>

39	On 17 June 1998 Bryson J upheld Wah Lai's application and ordered that the
injunction restraining the Registrar-General be dissolved.
<P>

40	On 24 June 1998 the liquidator of Craftmill, Mr McIntosh successfully made
application for the reregistration of that company
which had been dissolved and
deregistered on 24 June 1997.
<P>

41	On 30 October 1998 Wah Lai pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s12a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12A</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b>
sought to have the lease registered in the name of Buddies Liquor removed from
the registered title and also sought to have a caveat
which had been entered in
the name of Mr Vella, which had lapsed, to be removed from the title.
<P>

42	The Land Titles office following a request made on behalf of Mr Vella by his
solicitor, extended time in which it would deal
with Wah Lai's request until 8
December 1998.
<P>

43	On 2 February 1999 following an application made by Craftmill, Sperling J
granted that company an injunction restraining the
Registrar-General from
cancelling, removing or deregistering the Buddies Liquor lease from the subject
title until 4 February 1999.
<P>

44	Subsequently that injunction was extended by Barr J and ultimately by
myself. The final order which I made extends the injunction
until further
order.
<P>

45	On 11 December Mr Vella had sought an injunction restraining the removing of
the Buddies Liquor lease and also a mareeva injunction
restraining Wah Lai from
dealing with the proceedings of the sale of the subject premises. Windeyer J
rejected those applications.
<P>

46	Soon thereafter Mr Vella moved the Court of Appeal for the same injunctions
pending appeals from the interlocutory judgments
of Windeyer and Bryson JJ.
Mason P rejected that application.
<P>

47	On 19 January 1999 Craftmill took out the Notice of Motion seeking the
relief I have referred to at the outset of these reasons.
The injunctive relief
relating to the title to which I have referred was then sought and obtained.
<P>

48	As I have said Craftmill can only make an application to be joined as a
defendant if the judgment for possession is set aside.
If it is not the action
is complete and thus there is no room for any additional parties.
<P>

49	The power of the court to set aside a judgment is discretionary. In
exercising its discretion the number of matters which the
court will take into
account in determining whether or not to exercise that discretion are
manifold.
<P>

50	However, one matter which the court invariably takes into account is the
question whether or not the party seeking to have the
judgment set aside has a
prospective defence on the merits. Even if that party does have such a
prospective defence the matter does
not end there.
<P>

51	Delay in bringing such an application is a matter which the court always
considers. Significant delay would not necessarily be
fatal to such an
application if, for instance, a party can show good reason for that delay
having occurred.
<P>

52	Another matter which the court takes into account on the exercise of its
discretion arises when the party who has the benefit
of the judgment has taken
steps on the basis of the judgment obtained which steps will result in the
party being significantly disadvantaged
should the judgment be set aside.
<P>

53	In the instant case following its obtaining of possession pursuant to the
judgment, Wah Lai has sought to sell the property.
It first attempted to sell
the property by way of auction on 1 August 1998 when the property was passed
in. I should say Equity proceedings
had been commenced by Mr Vella on the day
before.
<P>

54	Ultimately on 11 September 1998 Wah Lai entered into a contract for the sale
of land in the sum $1,600,000 to a company called
Callwork Pty Limited. That
contract is still on foot and there is no evidence before me to indicate that
Notice to Complete has been
given by Callwork albeit the completion date set by
the contract, namely 42 days from 11 September 1998, has long since passed.
<P>

55	The contract, by clause 17, provides that "normally the vendor must give the
purchaser vacant possession of the property on completion."
Should the judgment
be set aside and Craftmill be allowed in as a defendant and Wah Lai could not
complete the contract if called
upon to do so by the purchaser because of its
inability to give vacant possession.
<P>

56	All the more so if Craftmill succeeded in defeating Wah Lai's claim for
possession because Mr Vella's lease has a number of years
to run and if it be
that their occupation of the premises is legitimate the chance of Wah Lai
selling the property for a number of
years would be considerably diminished.
<P>

57	Should Wah Lai not complete when called upon so to do by the present
purchaser then of course it could be the subject of an action
for damages
brought by the purchaser for, inter alia, loss of a bargain. Plainly enough Wah
Lai would be considerably disadvantaged
should this course of events occur. I
shall return to this aspect of the matter later in these reasons.
<P>

58	I turn then to the question of delay. As I have already mentioned judgment
was obtained by Wah Lai on 17 April 1996. Prior to
the obtaining of judgment on
11 November 1995 a Notice of Claim for possession pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7</a> r 8 which
was addressed to Miss Gleeson was purportedly served by a Mr Ramshaw at the
subject premises.
<P>

59	At the time Miss Gleeson was, as has been noted by Sully J, a director of
Craftmill which was, of course, still in existence
at that time. The mode of
service purportedly effected by Mr Ramshaw was to deliver the notice to a
person over the age of eighteen
years within the premises. Mr Ramshaw both by
affidavit and by oral testimony deposed that the person upon whom he served the
document
was at the time serving behind the bar of the hotel. That person, so
Mr Ramshaw deposed, acknowledged that he knew Miss Gleeson.
<P>

60	A challenge was mounted to Mr Ramshaw's evidence of service on the basis
that his recollection of events when he gave evidence
on 10 February 1999 was
necessarily dulled by both the elapse of time and the number of documents he
had served in his capacity as
a commercial agent between 11 November 1995 and
that date.
<P>

61	Furthermore the fact that Mr Ramshaw had in fact made two affidavits of
service and had deposed orally as to service was a matter
so it was put, which
would caste doubt upon the efficacy of his evidence.
<P>

62	While it is true that Mr Ramshaw made two affidavits in the matter they are
not inconsistent with each other. The second adds
information to the first.
There was nothing Mr Ramshaw said in cross-examination which, in my view, was
inconsistent with the contents
of his affidavits. I do not have any doubt that
Mr Ramshaw did in fact serve the Notice of Claim for possession on a person
apparently
over the age of eighteen years on the subject premises on 11
November 1995.
<P>

63	Also I have no doubt that that person was ostensibly in charge of the
premises at the time. Miss Gleeson was the licensee of
the hotel and was a
director of Craftmill at the time and also an employee. The only inference to
be drawn as to the status of the
person behind the bar was that he, like Miss
Gleeson, was an employee or agent of Craftmill at the time.
<P>

64	I thus find that Craftmill had constructive notice of the proceedings for
possession which had been taken out by Wah Lai on 29
September 1995. However,
that, as I shall now detail, is not the only notice which Craftmill, through Mr
Vella, had that proceedings
were either on foot or contemplated prior to the
entry of judgment.
<P>

65	First, Mr Vella, in an affidavit states that in or about February 1996 he
had been told by Wah Lai's estate agent that the company
"wanted to throw him
out." He then engaged a solicitor, a Mr Michael Kirkpatrick.
<P>

66	The undisputed evidence is that Mr Kirkpatrick was told on 8 March 1996 and
on 12 April 1996 by Mr E Reuben, solicitor for Wah
Lai that proceedings for
possession had commenced in the court. A letter written by Mr Kirkpatrick to Mr
Reuben on 8 May 1996 clearly
indicates that Mr Vella was aware of the
proceedings.
<P>

67	While, Mr Vella is now the sole shareholder in Craftmill there is no real
dispute that at all material times prior to either
the issue of the Supreme
Court proceedings and the entry of judgment on 17 April 1996 Mr Vella was in
control of Craftmill. I find
that he was (or should have been) well aware of
the proceedings prior to the entry of judgment.
<P>

68	It was submitted on behalf of the company that even if Mr Vella was so aware
any dilatoriness on his behalf (and consequently
Craftmill) should be excused.
The basis of this submission was that his evidence before Sully J (which was an
exhibit in these proceedings)
should persuade me that Mr Vella was a na&iuml;ve
man of slender literacy skills and thus his failure to move with promptitude
should
be overlooked. Indeed this, it was put, was a reason for him being
nominated as the applicant in the misconceived proceedings before
Sully J.
<P>

69	I am far from being so persuaded. The evidence reveals that Mr Vella has
been engaged as a proprietor in the catering and hotel
industry since 1968. To
survive in such an industry for so long is not in my view an indicia of
naivety. No does this history indicate
that any lack of literacy has been a
great hindrance to his business activities. Furthermore in an affidavit
tendered on Mr Vella's
behalf in the Court of Appeal a valuer, one Timothy
Simpson deposes, inter alia:
<P>

	"I have known the plaintiff for more than 20 years as a real estate client who
has bought and sold many properties."
<P>

These matters lead me to the conclusion that Mr Vella is anything but
na&iuml;ve and certainly not inexperienced in real property
dealings.
Accordingly, I reject the submission.
<P>

70	As I have said earlier an important question to be determined by a court in
deciding whether or not a judgment should be set
aside involves the matter of
determining if the moving party has a meritorious defence.
<P>

71	Again, the evidence disclosed that Wah Lai was at the time when proceedings
were issued (and indeed at time of judgment) owed
a large sum of money
representing unpaid rent on the subject premises.
<P>

72	Equally it seems clear that Mr Vella claims he had done a considerable
amount of work on the premises in an attempt to comply
with the fire order made
by the local municipal authority. At one stage he claimed that the value of the
work he had done exceeded
the amount of outstanding rent.
<P>

73	I should observe in his letter of 8 May 1996 Mr Kirkpatrick indicated that
if the amount of the work were set off against the
claims for outstanding rent
there would still be a balance owing to Wah Lai.
<P>

74	The importance of this matter is that the value of the building work raised
by way of set off would seem to be the only defence
which would be sought to be
raised to the claim for possession.
<P>

75	If Mr Vella had been an occupier at the time when the proceedings were
issued it may well be that a court might hold that his
claim of set off was a
sufficient indication of a defence to cause the court to set the judgment
aside. However, the occupier at
the relevant time was not Mr Vella but
Craftmill. 
<P>

76	Financial statements of Craftmill tendered in evidence demonstrate that no
debt representing the work done by either Mr Vella
or on his behalf on the
subject premises is nominated as a debt owed by the company. Accordingly,
whatever Mr Vella's position might
be no defence of set off is available to
Craftmill. As there is no dispute that at the relevant time a considerable
amount of rent
was owed, ex facie, Craftmill would have no defence to the claim
for possession.
<P>

77	Accordingly, purely as a question of merit I would dismiss Craftmill's
application to have the judgment set aside and it follows,
its application to
be joined as a defendant.
<P>

78	In any event in the light of the delay which has occurred and the fact that
Wah Lai has, by entering into a contract of sale,
taken a step which if the
proceedings were reopened and Craftmill be allowed in as a defendant, which
would result in Wah Lai being
severely disadvantaged in terms of its exposure
to litigation as a consequence of it being unable to complete the contract. I
am
of the view that I would not exercise the court's discretion to set the
judgment aside.
<P>

79	There are two matters which were raised by the parties going to the question
of discretion to which I should refer.
<P>

80	First, on behalf of Wah Lai evidence was put that the proceeds of the sale
of the property would be utilised, inter alia, to
discharge a debt owed by that
company. While I allowed this evidence over objection on further reflection I
am of the view that this
is an irrelevant consideration. I say this because the
fact that a contract for sale has been entered into is the matter of importance
and how the company intends to disperse the proceeds is not a matter which
should be taken into account. Accordingly, I have disregarded
this piece of
evidence in concluding as I have.
<P>

81	The evidence of Mr Timothy Simpson, valuer, to which I have already referred
was that the subject premises were worth more than
the sale price achieved. It
was thus submitted that no disadvantage but rather a benefit would flow to Wah
Lai if the relief sought
by Craftmill were granted.
<P>

82	I make these observations relating to this submission. It does not
necessarily follow that a resale of the premises would achieve
the enhanced sum
referred to by Mr Simpson. It is a notorious fact that real property markets
can fluctuate unexpectedly and rapidly.
Even if Mr Simpson's valuation could be
considered as immutable it still does not remove the hazard of Wah Lai being
successfully
sued by its purchaser should it fail to comply. I am thus not
persuaded that this submission should cause me to exercise any discretionary
relief in Craftmill's favour.
<P>

83	I should add that if Mr Vella is of the view that he has a valid claim
against Wah Lai for work done on the premises there is
no reason why he could
not commence proceedings to recoup the expenses which he alleges he has
incurred.
<P>

84	In the event I dismiss both applications with costs. The injunction
originally granted by Sperling J on 2 February 1999 and extended
as detailed
above is dissolved forthwith. I shall reserve the question of costs in relation
to that injunction until after the delivery
of these reasons.
