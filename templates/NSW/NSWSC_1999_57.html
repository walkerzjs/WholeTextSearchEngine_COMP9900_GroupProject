<b>JANET HARTIGAN v INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS
INCORPORATED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>The plaintiff commenced these proceedings by Statement of
Claim on 9 August 1994.  They relate to transactions which she says happened
about November 1988 in which she conveyed a rural property at Rosebery Creek in
the Kyogle Shire to the defendant by deed of gift.
 The deed recited that she
was desirous of promoting the objects of and of benefiting the defendant.  The
terms of the deed would
establish that the conveyance was free from any
resulting trust and that the property was to be dealt with as part of the
general
assets of the defendant.  The deed bears date 13 April 1989 which was
some months after the time when the plaintiff says she executed
it.  The gift
was perfected by a transfer under the Torrens System executed by her and
registered.  She seeks to set the gift aside.
 The defendant alleges in its
defence that it sold the property for $83,000.00 in August 1989 and later
transferred it to the purchasers
by a registered transfer.
<P>

2	Before the Master on 25 May 1998 plaintiff's counsel produced (Exhibit 1) a
draft of a Second Amended Statement of Claim.  This
draft is defective because
the particulars given in a series of letters through the earlier years were not
incorporated in the Statement
of Claim.  It does not raise any new claim but
greatly rationalises what the plaintiff puts forward by limiting the claim to
undue
influence.
<P>

3	The evidence now brought forward by the plaintiff relating to the
circumstances of the gift shows a strong prima facie case that
the gift was
made at a time when the plaintiff stood in a relationship of influence with the
organisational structure of the Hari
Krishna movement of which the defendant
was the property-holding representative.  This was so because, as her evidence
would show,
she had in August 1987 with her husband become a life member of the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness, was a non-initiated
member,
was expected to follow instructions and directions for initiated devotees, had
from that time onwards regularly attended
functions and meetings;  that the
property at Rosebery Creek was her home and her only asset, that she was
assisted by the president
of the Murwillumbah Temple in making arrangements for
the gift and that the documents relating to the gift were prepared by
solicitors
who acted for the defendant and whose offices she attended for the
purpose, and without her having any independent source of advice
from a lawyer,
or from any other person.  In these circumstances the burden of showing that
the gift was not affected by the relationship
of influence would rest on the
defendant.
<P>

4	The defendant applied by Notice of Motion filed on 23 April 1998 for an order
pursuant to Part 33 rule 6 that the proceedings
be dismissed for want of
prosecution;  the relevant ground in the rule is that the plaintiff does not
prosecute the proceedings with
due dispatch.  After a hearing on 25 May 1998
Master Macready on 29 June 1998 for reasons then published ordered that the
proceedings
be dismissed and that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs.  The
plaintiff appealed to a Judge by Notice of Appeal of 27 July
1998.  The appeal
is an appeal by way of re-hearing against the learned Master's decision and is
not a hearing de novo of the application
in the Notice of Motion.  However
there is evidence before me which was not before the Master.  The Master
observed on the fact that
the plaintiff herself did not give evidence on the
application and regarded that as important.  For reasons which I stated during
the hearing I gave leave under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75A</a> (7) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a>
for her counsel to read her affidavit of 31 July 1998, and she gave oral
evidence including cross-examination.  The matters on which
the Master made
findings and exercised discretion require to be reconsidered on the basis of a
different body of  evidence to that
on which the Master acted.
<P>

5	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Part 33</a> r 6 deals with want of prosecution.  Sub-rules (1) and (2) are as
follows:
<P>

	<i>6 (1) Where a plaintiff does not, within six weeks after the pleadings are
closed, set the proceedings down for trial, the Court,
on motion by any other
party, may, on terms, dismiss the proceedings or make such other order as the
Court thinks fit.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2) Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or
direction as to the conduct of the proceedings, or does not prosecute
the
proceedings with due despatch, the Court may, on application by any party or of
its own motion, stay or dismiss the proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Sub-rules (3) and (4) deal with dismissal on the Court's own motion and
are not relevant.  Similar provision is made for proceedings
commenced by
Summons in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> r 12.  Such orders for dismissal are not final;  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Part 40</a>
r 8 (1).
<P>

6	<i>Stollznow v Calvert</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 749</a> and the judgment of Cross J
then under appeal - <i>Calvert v Stollznow</i> - Ritchie's Supreme Court
Procedure NSW Volume 2 [13, 022] have established the practice in New South
Wales relating to summary stay
or dismissal where proceedings have not been
conducted with despatch.  In that case the Court acted under its inherent
powers;  the
proceedings were not conducted under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i>
1970</a> or rules thereunder, which did not apply because the issues for trial had
been filed before 1 September 1972;  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p1b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1B</a> r 9.  Accordingly the leading
judgment of Moffitt P does not address, in terms, the conduct of proceedings
with due despatch.  There
could be no doubt that the present proceedings have
not been conducted with due despatch.  The discretionary considerations which
arise have in practice been treated as indicated in <i>Stollznow v Calvert</i>
and also by the judgment of Walsh J in <i>Witten v Lombard Australia
Limited</i> (1968) 88 WN (Pt.1) (NSW) 405;  see <i>Southern Cross Exploration
NL and Others v Fire &amp; All Risks Insurance Co Ltd and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20NSWLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4
NSWLR 491 (Waddell</a> J).
<P>

7	The judgment of Moffitt P shows that the discretion is not closely confined,
and its exercise in each case depends on the facts
of that case.  See
paragraphs (4) to (15) at pages 751-755.
<P>

8	Judicial authority in England is somewhat more prescriptive, and in
<i>Birkett v James</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 297</a> Lord Diplock at 318, speaking in relation
to the inherent jurisdiction of the English High Court, stated limited
circumstances in
which only the power should be exercised.  Some of those
circumstances are not relevant, but that presently relevant is that the
power
should be exercised only where the Court is satisfied.
<P>

	<i> "...2 (a) that there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay on the part
of the plaintiff or his lawyers, and (b) that such a delay
will give rise to a
substantial risk that it is not possible to have a fair trial of the issues in
the action or is such as is likely
to cause or to have caused serious prejudice
to the defendants..."</i>
<P>

9	Submissions before me on behalf of the plaintiff proceeded on the view that
the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Cohen v McWilliam and Another</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR 476</a> is relevant and establishes a relative primacy of the claim
to have litigation disposed of on a determination of the merits over
other
considerations.  That decision dealt with another subject, the amendment of
pleadings, and in other circumstances, an amendment
presented for the first
time and without notice when the case is called on for hearing at a time
previously appointed and after its
state of readiness had been reviewed at
several directions hearings.  The plaintiff was confronted with the defendant's
application
without any opportunity to consider its position or adduce evidence
of prejudice.  No rule of Court similar to Pt. 33 r. 6 was under
consideration.
In my view the majority judgments in <i>Cohen v McWilliam</i> provide no
guidance for the exercise of the discretion now before me.  The majority
judgments did not address problems arising from
delay or further delay by a
plaintiff in the conduct of the proceedings, and the case was not one where any
close address to the
effect of delay by a plaintiff could be expected.
<P>

10	The judgment of Priestley JA does not mention the opportunities which the
defendant had had during the interlocutory period to
raise her defence by
pleading, or to indicate at pre-trial directions hearings that she did or might
wish to do so.  It must be understood
that those opportunities were not
regarded as having any significance, nor was their not being taken regarded as
having any significance.
 Nor was there any mention of the expectations and
position of the plaintiff in the litigation, or of any significance which
should
be attributed to time and endeavour used by the plaintiff in preparing
for trial, to expectations that a due course of procedure
would be followed or
to expectations that the ground on which the claim was resisted should be made
known to the plaintiff.  No indication
was given in the majority judgments that
any significance at all attached to the plaintiff's readiness, after years of
preparation,
to go to trial on known issues, or that there was anything to be
lost or any significance at all to be attached to the jettison of
the
plaintiff's readiness, trouble and expense without notice for the benefit of an
opponent who had not got her case ready over
some years.  Indeed the plaintiff
was not mentioned at any point in Priestley JA's judgment, and no interest of
the plaintiff fell
for consideration.  Sheller JA did give some consideration
to the position of the plaintiff and, although there was no exposition
of the
value attributed to that position, it is evident that the plaintiff's position
was treated as of slight importance.  The reason
for exclusive concentration on
the position of the applicant was, it might be thought, worthy of some
articulation, but received
none.
<P>

11	The public interest in Court efficiency was referred to by Priestley JA with
a tepid observation at 478B to the effect that nothing
particularly wrong was
seen in the Court taking it into account, and the observation at 482A-B to the
effect that the idea that both
sides should be heard before a dispute is
decided is usually regarded as more basic than the need for Court efficiency.
"Court efficiency"
is a terse mnemonic indeed for the public and private
interests involved in conducting Court business according to a known and
predictable
course, on which expensive preparations can reasonably be based,
and with due use of publicly-owned resources, paid for by taxation
levied under
stern laws and for the most part out of the proceeds of personal exertion of
persons who make no use of the Court. 
A lengthy exposition could be made of
what is involved in Court efficiency, with an examination of the adverse impact
on the private
interests of other litigants in the instant proceedings, of
other litigants who are claiming the Court's attention, and in the public
interest in maintaining the Court's authority by observance of arrangements
with which the Court has directed litigants to comply.
 There is a public
interest in the Court's requiring litigants to respect the due exercise of its
compulsory powers over litigants,
and in itself acting in the same way, and in
maintenance of faith with persons who have expended time and energy to conform
with
the Court's directions.  It is injurious to the respect which the Court
and others should maintain for the Court's authority if arrangements
made with
care are set aside for the benefit of persons who have not complied with the
rules of Court.
<P>

12	It is I conclude to be understood that a claim to bring a defence  forward
for decision exists irrespective of neglect, however
long extended, of earlier
opportunities to bring the defence forward, irrespective of the impact of so
doing on other parties, and
with little weight to be attributed to the
interests of other litigants.  A wholehearted non-conformity attracts sedulous
protection
not extended to the compliant.  In my view the breadth of the
relevant discretionary conditions established in <i>Stollznow v Calvert</i> for
cases where there has been a want of prosecution is not restricted by anything
to be gleaned from <i>Cohen v McWilliam</i>.
<P>

13	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act </i>1969</a> does not apply to the plaintiff's claim,
which is wholly equitable, and that Act would be applied, if at all, only by
analogy.  The
plaintiff's claim presents very distant analogies, perhaps no
useful analogies to a common law claim;  it is to the effect that the
gift
should be set aside because it was obtained by undue influence, to be proved by
showing a relationship of influence.  She alleges
that the defendant bears the
onus of showing, and cannot show that the gift was not produced by undue
influence.  If a case of this
kind is made out, equitable remedies are
available, as appropriate to the facts, on the footing that the plaintiff
remained the equitable
owner.  While this is a matter for further
consideration, it is difficult to suppose that the plaintiff would succeed in
obtaining
equitable compensation on the basis that the defendant sold the
property in 1989 without lawful authorisation or trust power and
is now
accountable for its present value;  it seems more likely that an appropriate
remedy would involve holding the plaintiff to
the sale and awarding equitable
compensation by reference to the proceeds of the sale.  I see at the best a
strained analogy with
claims which the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i> would bar, whether
the plaintiff's claim is in concept a claim to receive the property back or in
concept a claim for an amount of
money.  If the plaintiff's claim were to be
thought of as a claim to have the proceeds of completion of the sale in October
1989
paid to her, the time to bring proceedings expired in October 1995.
<P>

14	It is important that although the times which it might be understood from
the terms of the Rules of Court were contemplated as
being available for a
number of steps were greatly exceeded, there was never any order or direction
by the Court to the plaintiff
to proceed with despatch.  She has not
disregarded any direction by the Court:  she has not acted with contumacy and
was never given
any warning by the Court that her opportunity to have her case
heard was likely to be terminated.  The evidence first speaks of any
endeavour
to produce action in a letter of 26 August 1997 from the defendant's solicitors
to her then solicitors, giving a reasoned
and detailed account of difficulties
which had arisen from delay and in terms threatening to apply for dismissal on
the ground of
want of prosecution unless steps were taken to either resolve or
prosecute the proceedings.  Nothing effectual seems to have happened
by 23
April 1998, but the plaintiff became relatively active thereafter when she
produced a list of documents dated 7 May 1998 and
made inspection available.
<P>

15	The Master gave a chronology of the proceedings at page 3 of his judgment.
The significant periods of delay appear to be these:
<P>

	There was sufficient discontent with the transaction for the plaintiff's
husband (and not the plaintiff herself) to apply for legal
aid on 26 June 1990
for the purpose of challenging the transaction in some way.
<P>

	On 9 August 1994 the Statement of Claim was filed.
<P>

   	On 24 February 1995 an Amended Statement of Claim was filed.
<P>

	On 20 October 1995 the defendant applied by Notice of Motion for further and
better particulars.
<P>

	On 16 November 1995 an Order for further and better particulars was made.
<P>

	Particulars were supplied in a series of letters from 13 November 1995 to 6
February 1996.
<P>

	On 22 February 1996 Defence to the Amended Statement of Claim was filed.
<P>

16	The initial period of about 18 months after commencement of the proceedings
achieved a result which could have been achieved
in a few weeks if the
proceedings had had close attention on each side.  In a case where the parties
were not seized with urgency
it would not be surprising if it took six months
to obtain particulars and file a Defence.  In my view the plaintiff should be
regarded
as responsible for  about a year of the delay until February 1996,
mainly attributable to amending the Statement of Claim and giving
particulars.
<P>

17	On 2 August 1996 the defendant gave Notice for Discovery.  This delay of
over five months should be attributed to the defendant.
<P>

18	On 7 May 1998 discovery was given.  Over one year and seven months passed at
the stage of discovery.  Without unusually close
attention discovery can be
expected to take about three months.  However it is to be observed that the
defendant did not give discovery
until 27 January 1998 and this seems to set a
standard, in a way, for the plaintiff's conduct.  The plaintiff took three
months longer
than the defendant did.
<P>

19	Overall I attribute about one year and three months of the delay between
commencement of the proceedings and the plaintiff's
giving discovery, which was
approximately at the time of the Notice of Motion, to delay by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff shares, at
least equally with the defendant, in responsibility
for the other delays.  Everything that happened in the proceedings should have
been achieved in six months or well under a year.
<P>

20	It appears from exhibit A that by 26 June 1990 the plaintiff's husband was
discontented with some aspect of his dealings with
the defendant because on
that date he applied for legal aid to bring civil proceedings which he
described as "fraud dispute".  When
giving details of the case which he wished
to bring he appears to have spoken of the transaction in which the plaintiff's
property
was given to the defendant;  he spoke of donating his own property and
of its later being sold for $85,000, and said that he gave
it on the
understanding that he could live there rent free.  The plaintiff witnessed this
application for legal aid.  However it
was not her application.
<P>

21	According to the plaintiff's evidence after she made the gift she with her
family moved to the defendant's farm at Murwillumbah
and they lived there until
they were asked to leave in early 1991.  She says that at that time she decided
to seek legal advice in
relation to her gift, and her husband wrote a letter
requesting compensation to which there was no reply.  She consulted a solicitor
in Murwillumbah in early 1991 to discuss the possibility of recovering the
property.  In about February 1991 she moved with her family
to Tasmania.  They
lived in that State, with a number of moves and in very poor financial
circumstances;  she says they moved at
least 8 times, for several reasons
including financial difficulties.  She has lived on social benefits, as did her
husband.  The
plaintiff and her husband separated in November 1997.
<P>

22	The plaintiff gives an account of her communications with her solicitors,
which involved first an application for legal aid,
which was not successful as
she was informed in March 1993.  She then attempted to obtain a litigation
loan.  She began to make payments
on account of costs to her solicitor.  A
draft statement of claim was prepared by June 1994 and filed on 9 August
1994.
<P>

23	Thereafter the plaintiff gives an account of the time spent in preparation,
and in substance she explains the delay by reference
to difficulties in
communication through her absence in Tasmania and many changes of address, and
the need to raise money out of
very small incomes to make payments to the
solicitor on account.  Payments were made until about June 1996 when the
financial burden
was too much.  She continued to communicate with her solicitor
but was unable to make an arrangement satisfactory to him about costs,
and had
no satisfactory arrangements for legal representation until about January 1998,
when arrangements began for her to receive
legal representation on a pro bono
basis through The Law Society of New South Wales.
<P>

24	The plaintiff's explanation for the delay is an explanation in terms of her
being impeded by circumstances and lack of funds
from pressing on with the
proceedings.  I am satisfied that there has not been any delay arising out of
any lack of wish to carry
on with the claim or lack of sincerity in its
presentation.  There have been long delays and extensive periods of
inattention, but
these have resulted from her lack of opportunities and
resources to give effectual attention to the matter, not from abandonment
of
her claim.
<P>

25	The Master was of the view that the plaintiff had taken an inordinate time
to progress the claim to the point which it reached
in 1998.  In my view this
is correct.  However regard must be had to the plaintiff's circumstances, which
operated so that she did
not have freedom of action or any true opportunity to
conduct the litigation as a reasonable litigant equipped with funds would have
done.  The Master was of the view that the delay was also inexcusable and had
not been properly explained.  I now have the benefit
of the plaintiff's
explanation.  While I could not express any approval of the plaintiff's conduct
in waiting until August 1994 to
commence the proceedings, and then delaying
extensively at interlocutory steps thereafter, I do not when I look at the
circumstances
regard the delay as inexcusable to a degree or in a sense which
would justify its being treated as a ground on which consideration
of the
merits should be refused, or as an overwhelmingly important discretionary
consideration favouring doing so.
<P>

26	In relation to the delay it is I think relevant to bring under consideration
the time which the defendant has taken to attend
to interlocutory steps,
including most significantly the production of a discovery list;  and also to
have regard to the fact that
the defendant could have taken steps to bring the
proceedings on for a hearing by itself setting the proceedings down for hearing
after issue had been joined with the filing of its Defence and the expiry of
time for a reply;  that is to say, in March 1996.  If
the defendant had done so
the proceedings would have come on for hearing by now.  The defendant's not
doing so is probably referable
to the defendant's wish to have discovery, if
not exclusively then as the most prominent consideration;  and the defendant
itself
has taken an inordinately long time to deal with discovery.
<P>

27	The Master reviewed the evidence before him about the endeavours on behalf
of the defendant and its solicitor to locate witnesses
or prospective
witnesses, obtain statements from them and generally ascertain what the
defendant can do to present a case and discharge
the burden of proof which it
appears will fall upon it.  The defendant's solicitor's account of the
difficulties she has encountered
in locating persons who had contact with the
plaintiff at or about the time of the gift and while she lived in the
community, and
of their difficulties in recollecting events, formed the basis
of the Master's finding (at page 12) to the effect that it was obvious
that
prejudice has occurred in the time since proceedings commenced.  The further
evidence which was admitted at the hearing before
me does not significantly
affect these findings, which should be adhered to.
<P>

28	I address the discretionary questions anew because the basis on which the
discretion is to be exercised is different to the basis
under consideration by
the Master.  The evidence relating to excuse for delay is quite different.  The
delay was inordinate, far
out of the usual order for effective conduct of legal
business, but the defendant has also, to a less extent, been involved in delay.
In my opinion it should not  be said that the delay has been inexcusable;  the
plaintiff has offered explanations for her delays
in terms which rebut a
conclusion that she abandoned the proceedings, and there is interaction between
the influence on her delay
of her lack of resources and the nature of her case,
which if accepted would show that she made an improvident gift of all her
significant
resources.
<P>

29	It is clear, as it was before the Master, that the defendant has incurred
prejudice as a result of delay and would have been
in a better position to
ascertain whether it has and can present a good defence if the proceedings had
been brought on for trial
some years earlier.  However it remains the case that
the leading figures in the transaction are available:  they are the defendant's
then solicitor and Mr David Evans who at the relevant time was the President of
the Murwillumbah Temple and who principally dealt
with the plaintiff in
relation to the gift.  Overall, while the effect of delay has been to diminish
the lines of inquiry open to
the defendant, the leading figures in the
transaction continue to be available.  The nature of the transaction was such
that, having
regard to the positions of the leading figures, they could well,
acting reasonably, have adverted to the possibility of challenge
at all times
from the beginning.
<P>

30	My view overall is that, in the exercise of my discretion, I should not
order that the proceedings be dismissed.
<P>

31	My orders are:-
<P>

	 1.  The appeal is allowed and the order of Master Macready of 29 
<P>

June 1998 is set aside.
<P>

2.  The defendant's Notice of Motion of 23 April 1998 is 
<P>

dismissed.
<P>

3.  I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the 
<P>

Notice of Motion up to and including 29 June 1998.
<P>

4.  I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the appeal.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-31 are the reasons for judgment of the
Honourable Justice John Bryson.
