<i>Thursday, 8 April 1999.</i>
<P>

<b>3402/93	MARK OLIVER DRESSLER  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>		GEORGE MRISH &amp; 2 ORS</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> On 30 November 1998, the plaintiff Mark Dressler filed a
notice of motion seeking, substantively, summary judgment upon his claim,
which
originally had been instituted by summons and which subsequently had been the
subject of a statement of claim filed on 29 July
1997.  
<P>

2	That notice of motion was on 24 February 1999 specially fixed to be heard by
me this day, 8 April 1999.
<P>

3	On 12 March 1999 Donna Marie Mrish filed a notice of motion by which she
sought to be substituted for the first defendant George
Mrish.  It should here
be noted that the first defendant is now deceased, he having died by his own
hand on 29 July 1998.  
<P>

4	The applicant, Donna Marie Mrish was not in a position to proceed on 12 March
1999, and the notice of motion filed by her was
stood over to 26 March 1999.
After a contested hearing on that date, I made certain orders upon that notice
of motion.  Those orders
included the following:
<P>

	I order that the applicant Donna Marie Mrish be permitted to represent the
interests of the first defendant, now deceased, in relation
to any claim by the
plaintiff against the asset referred to in item 4 of the inventory of property
which is Annexure C to the affidavit
of Phillip James Beazley sworn 26 March
1999, but that the applicant not otherwise be permitted to participate in the
proceedings.

<P>

5	When the matter was called upon for hearing this morning, Counsel for the
applicant filed in Court a notice of motion by Donna
Marie Mrish by which the
applicant sought, substantively an order that today's hearing be vacated and an
order that the applicant
be appointed to represent the estate of the first
defendant, George Mrish, for the purposes of the present proceedings.
<P>

6	It will be appreciated that the second of those applications, the appointment
of the applicant to represent the estate of the
first defendant, is an
application in substance identical to that which was heard and determined less
than two weeks ago, on 26 March
1999.
<P>

7	The evidence which has been placed before the Court in support of the
applicant's present application discloses that the applicant
has now obtained a
grant of Letters of Administration of the intestate estate of the first
defendant George Mrish, that grant having
been made yesterday, 7 April 1999.

<P>

8	Otherwise, there has been no change in the circumstances which obtained when
the Court determined the identical application of
the plaintiff on 26 March
1999.
<P>

9	The evidence, however, does disclose several matters which were not before
the Court on the earlier occasion.  One of them is
the degree of knowledge of
the applicant concerning the nature of the relationship between her then
husband, the first defendant,
and the parents and brother of the plaintiff.
Those three persons were the victims of the first defendant, who was
subsequently convicted
of murdering each of those persons.
<P>

10	The evidence also discloses, contrary to the clear impression given to the
Court by the earlier affidavit evidence filed on behalf
of the applicant, that
on 21 January 1999, the present solicitor for the applicant had knowledge of
the substance of the plaintiff's
and also had copies of the pleadings in the
proceedings.  
<P>

11	It does, however, now appear that an asset which is being claimed by the
applicant as an asset in the estate of the deceased
(other than the asset which
was the subject of the order made on 26 March 1999) is also now an asset which
is the subject of the
present proceedings.  That asset is property at Orange,
being situate at and known as 55 Dalton Street, Orange.
<P>

12	There was doubt as to whether that property claimed as an asset in the
estate of the first defendant was the same property which
was the subject of a
claim by the plaintiff in the present proceedings.  When the matter was before
me on 26 March the evidence did
not disclose the identicality of that property
with property against which the plaintiff is seeking relief in the substantive
proceedings.
 
<P>

13	It seems to me, however, appropriate that in the present application of the
applicant I should allow the applicant to participate
in the proceedings, not
merely in relation to the claim of the plaintiff against the asset referred to
in the order of 26 March 1999,
but additionally against the further asset,
being the property at Orange referred to in the inventory of property under the
heading
Real Property as item 1(b).
<P>

14	I propose to make an order in that direction. But otherwise the applicant
will not be permitted to participate generally in the
proceedings.  I refuse
the application for a vacation of today's hearing date.
<P>

15	I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the order made by me on 26 March 1999 	be varied by
substituting for the words "the asset 	referred to in item
4" the words "the
assets referred 	to in item 1(b) and item 4".
<P>

	2.	I order that the costs of the notice of motion filed by 	the applicant,
Donna Marie Mrish on 8 April 1999 	be the costs of the
plaintiff in the
proceedings.
<P>

<P>

<P>
