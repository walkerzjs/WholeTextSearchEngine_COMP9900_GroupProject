<b><u>30126/98  -  WAYNE EDWARD SALES v DIRECTOR GENERAL OF DEPARTMENT OF FAIR
TRADING and COMMERCIAL TRIBUNAL OF NEW SOUTH WALES</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b> This summons seeks relief in respect
of proceedings heard by a deputy chairman of the Commercial Tribunal.  The
jurisdiction of the
Court is prescribed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20(5)</a> and (6) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial
Tribunal Act 1984</a>.  That statute has been replaced by other legislation coming
into effect on 1 March 1999 but it is common ground that transitional
provisions have effect to preserve the validity of these proceedings.
<P>

2   	The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited to
decisions with respect to matters of law.  
<P>

3   	The statement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/index.html#p51" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a> would appear to identify
the contentions of legal error in the following terms:
<P>

"6. During the hearing (which was de novo before the Second Defendant), three
main issues were agitated:
<P>

(i)	whether the decision of the First Defendant to reject the Plaintiff's
calculation of twenty years experience was a final decision
or decision from
which an appeal could be brought to the Second Defendant pursuant to Section 85
of the Building Services Corporation
Act.
<P>

(ii)	whether the Second Defendant had jurisdiction to hear and determine the
matter if the decision was not a final decision but
an interim decision,
<P>

(iii)	whether the Second Defendant had jurisdiction to direct the First
Defendant to permit the Plaintiff the opportunity to sit
the written technical
examination."
<P>

4   	On 14 August 1997 the plaintiff made application for a
"full individual building licence" and an endorsement as a contractor
pursuant
to s 28 of the Home Building act.  It is acknowledged that the first defendant
had prescribed qualifications for the attainment
of such licence which
designated the attainment of certain degrees, diplomas or certificates.  It is
conceded that the plaintiff
did not hold any of the prescribed qualifications
but sought to rely upon an exception.
<P>

5   	So far as is relevant the exception is in the following
terms:
<P>

"Applicants not holding any of the listed acceptable qualifications may still
qualify for issue of a Contractor Licence/Qualified
Supervisor Certificate as a
builder by successfully completing the Corporation's Written Technical
Examination provided they satisfy
the guidelines for entry into the exam.
These guidelines are as follows:
<P>

...................................
<P>

&#183;	The applicant holds no educational qualifications in the building
industry, but can show 20 years relevant industry experience."
<P>

6   	On 4 September 1997 the first defendant refused the
plaintiff's application which was communicated in a letter containing these
terms:
<P>

"The Department has now considered the application and I regret that I must
notify you that the Department has determined to refuse
to grant to you a
licence.
<P>

The Department has determined that an application for a licence as a builder
must hold one of the qualifications set out in the
enclosed brochure.
<P>

It has been noted that you do not hold one of the qualifications set out in the
brochure and have no formal qualifications relating
to the building
industry.
<P>

Where a person has no formal qualifications the Department requires that person
to have a minimum of twenty(20) years relevant building
experience in the
industry and successfully undertake a Written Technical Examination conducted
by the Building Industry Skills Centre
on behalf of the Department.
<P>

The Department is not satisfied from the information contained in your
application that you have the minimum required building experience
for entry to
the above examination."
<P>

7   	The facility for appeal against a decision of the first
defendant relating to application for the issue of a licence is provided
by
s 85 of the Home <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/" class="autolink_findacts">Building Act</a>.  Pursuant to that provision the plaintiff lodged
an appeal to the Commercial Tribunal.  A motion was filed by the first
defendant
seeking to have the appeal dismissed but no interlocutory order was
made in response to the motion and the appeal was listed for
final hearing.  On
3 December 1998 the Commercial Tribunal made orders including an order that the
appeal be dismissed to which was
added "it follows that order 1 of the notice
be granted".  The lastmentioned appears to be a reference to the motion.  
<P>

8   	These procedural matters are of historical interest only.
The gravamen of dispute is focussed upon the question whether the
Commercial
Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the apparent finding of
fact that the plaintiff did not have the
minimum required building experience
for entry into the Written Technical Examination.
<P>

9   	In her judgment the Deputy Chairman of the Commercial
Tribunal made the following observations:
<P>

"The Notice of Appeal, in effect, seeks a finding from the Tribunal that the
respondent erred in not finding the appellant had 20
years relevant experience,
and in so doing, it be directed by the Tribunal to allow the appellant the
opportunity of sitting its
Written Technical Examination.
<P>

The appeal was heard in conjunction with a Notice of Motion, (`the notice'), of
29 September 1998, filed by the respondent seeking
the dismissal of the appeal
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31(1)</a> of the Act on the basis that the appeal was
misconceived.
<P>

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present case is confined to a
consideration of criteria to be proved by the applicant, or
appellant in this
case, for a licence, and whether the application is to be granted, or whether
it is to be refused .......".
<P>

10   	The thrust of the argument on behalf of the plaintiff was
directed to a contention that as the appeal to the Commercial Tribunal
was a
hearing de novo in the sense that all issues were being retried the Tribunal
had erroneously restricted itself from determining
an ingredient issue of
whether the applicant was possessed of the necessary extent of experience to
entitle him to sit for the examination.
<P>

11   	Indeed it has been common ground at all hearings that the
plaintiff did not possess any of the specified qualifications and
had not sat
for the Written Technical Examination.  In the absence of qualification it was
inevitable that the first defendant refused
his application for licence.  So
much is indisputable.  
<P>

12   	The real dispute is about the finding of fact by the first
defendant that the applicant did not have the prerequisite experience
to
entitle him to sit for the examination and thereby accord himself a chance of
fulfilling a criterion for the grant of licence.

<P>

13   	In order for that finding to have been justiciable in the
Commercial Tribunal it must qualify within the scope of the expression
in s
85(a) of the Home <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/" class="autolink_findacts">Building Act</a> "any decision of the Director General relating
to" an application such as that made by the plaintiff.  
<P>

14   	It is the contention of the first defendant that the
decision "relating to" the application was the decision whether or not
the
applicant had requisite qualifications be it, for example, a Degree in
Engineering (structural) of the University of Technology
or the passing of the
Written Technical Examination. By what means the qualification was obtained, it
was contended, was a matter
extraneous to the decision.  
<P>

15   	What the plaintiff has sought to challenge appears to be
not an error in the decision relating to the refusal of licence but
rather an
asserted error in assessing the eligibility of the plaintiff to present himself
as a candidate for an examination which,
if passed, would provide him with a
criterion for licence. 
<P>

16   	My conclusion is that the submission of the first
defendant is correct and there was no legal error in the approach of the
Deputy
Chairman to the determination of the appeal.
<P>

17   	The removal of the issue of eligibility to sit for the
examination from the scope of a decision "relating to" the application
for
licence can be seen by analogy.  Suppose the Director General arbitrarily
purported to hold that an applicant holding the appropriate
degree in
engineering did not have that qualification.  It would be open to that
applicant to demonstrate (by presentation of his
testamur perhaps) at the
hearing of the appeal that that finding was wrong and at a hearing de novo an
appropriate order could be
made.  What the applicant (hypothetically) in the
present circumstances would need to show would be that the Director General was
incorrect in holding that the applicant had sat for and passed the Written
Technical Examination.  He had not.  It is not within
the ambit of appeal
against decision to overturn a prerequisite action, albeit made aliunde by the
same Director General, which inhibited
the applicant from attempting to gain
the qualification any more than it would be open to the Tribunal to require the
University
to permit a candidate to sit for an examination paper in order to
gain a qualifying degree.
<P>

18   	As I have said the real complaint of the plaintiff is not
that the decision of the first defendant was wrong in law but rather
that the
first defendant by reason of the view that he formed concerning the absence of
20 years relevant experience inhibited the
plaintiff from obtaining a
qualification for licence.  
<P>

19   	That the true nature of the challenge by the plaintiff is
an attack upon a collateral matter rather than an appeal against
a decision
relating to the application is manifest in the extract from the statement under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a> which offers no direct challenge to a legal ruling in the
appeal as distinct from a challenge to rejection by the first defendant
of the
plaintiff's claim to have 20 years relevant experience.  The appeal to the
Commercial Tribunal is a hearing de novo of the
application for licence but it
does not make available an unrestricted general challenge to any aspect of the
Director-General's
activity.
<P>

20   	Finally on the potential issue of the grant of remedy it
should be recorded that the Deputy Chairman included in her judgment
an
observation that:
<P>

"In any event, and if the Tribunal is wrong on this point, on the evidence
before it, it is not satisfied that a case has been established
on a purely
evidentiary basis, that the appellant undertook `20 years relevant industry
experience' between 1972 to date, which he
was required to satisfy as a
standard or requirement: see form L20 of exhibit 3.  At best, the evidence
before the Tribunal only
establishes approximately 10 years `relevant industry
experience', although, as noted earlier, it is not clear what actual work the
appellant undertook during this time, and its particular relevance to the
application for a contractor licence.
<P>

The appellant did not give any oral evidence, and apart from some very general
written testimonials, there was no evidence from
anyone as to the quality,
level or nature of the building work undertaken by him."
<P>

21   	The summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff is ordered to pay
the costs of the defendants' of the summons, the costs of the second
defendant
being costs appropriate to a submitting defendant.
<P>

                                                               **********
