<P>

FRIDAY 30 APRIL 1999
<P>

<u>17586 of 1985  Steven Strath, formerly known as Steven Orle, by his Tutor,
the Protective Commissioner v State of New South Wales.</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	The plaintiff makes a claim for damages arising out of personal injury.  The
personal injury was suffered following an incident
that took place in the
grounds of the Cabramatta Public School.
<P>

2	Questions of liability and quantum are in issue.  Both sides have called oral
evidence.  There has been tender of many photographs
and much documentation
(including experts' reports, school records and statements).  The trial
extended over four days.
<P>

3	The plaintiff was born on 18 August 1975 (he is now 23 years of age).  He has
an elder brother (Joseph born on 3 October 1972).
 His parents separated in
July 1981.  His mother married Terence Strath on 7 August 1985.  He continues
to live with his mother and
step-father.
<P>

4	In 1982 he commenced his schooling at Cabramatta Public School.  The incident
took place on 12 March 1984.  The plaintiff was
then eight years of age and in
year 3.  His brother was then in year 6 and about 11 years of age.  He and his
brother had returned
to play in the school grounds during non-school hours.
<P>

5	The plaintiff was then living with his mother and brother at Cabramatta.
They occupied a unit in a block of units located near
the school.  It was an
area of residential unit blocks and there were no near-by play areas.  The
plaintiff and his brother had adopted
the habit of returning to the school
(usually with other children) and playing on the grounds after school hours
(generally during
a period after 3.00 pm and up to 6.00 pm).  Access to the
play-ground was had by climbing over what has been described as a brick
fence
or wall.  The relevant part of the playing area had inter alia a fenced tennis
court, cricket nets and a pine log construction
known as a fort.  The fort is
depicted in the photographs which comprise Exhibit A.  These photographs were
taken by the plaintiff's
mother shortly after the incident.  Subsequently, the
fort was removed.  When this took place is somewhat unclear (the plaintiff's
mother said that it was no longer there when the plaintiff returned to school
in about June 1984).
<P>

6	The plaintiff has no memory of the day of the incident.  Joseph was not
present when the incident took place, as he had left the
play-ground with
friends prior to the incident to go to a nearby shop.  By the time of Joseph's
return to the play-ground, the ambulance
was in attendance and the plaintiff
was seen lying on the ground in the play area near the fort.  Joseph does not
know the identity
of any of the children with whom the plaintiff may have been
playing.  The plaintiff's mother came to the  school inter alia on both
13 and
14 March 1984 (presumably she took the photographs on one of those days). 
<P>

7	The plaintiff suffered a depressed fracture of the left side of the skull.
This was a severe head injury and he has been left
with severe physical
problems (including a right-sided heavy paresis).  There will be deterioration
of the right-hip joint.  His
medical reports are to be found in  Exhibit H. 
<P>

8	Following the incident, the plaintiff was first taken by ambulance to
Fairfield Hospital.  He was then transferred to Westmead
Hospital.  He
underwent a left parietal craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma.  He then
remained on ventilatory assistance until
20 March 1994.  He was discharged from
hospital on 6 June 1984.
<P>

9	In June 1984, the plaintiff returned to school.  Firstly, he attended for one
or two hours per day.  By the end of the year, he
was attending for the full
day.  He completed his primary school education at Cabramatta Public School at
the end of 1987.  In 1988,
he commenced schooling at Lyrnea High School in a
special class. Because of difficulties, he moved to Lawrence Hargrave School
For
Special Purposes.  He completed his High School education in 1993.
<P>

10	Since the incident, the plaintiff has undergone surgery.  There was surgery
to his right hip in 1991.  He had surgery to his
right ankle in 1992.  There
was further surgery to his right hip in 1993.  Later in the same year, he
underwent drainage of a haematoma
in the right groin.  Apart from surgery, he
has received considerable other treatment (including speech therapy and
physiotherapy).
 He continues to see his general practitioner (Dr Gibson) about
every three weeks.  At school, he was subjected to bullying and teasing.
 He
developed the view that he was different to others and this has led to
depression.  He says that his visits to Dr Gibson assist
with this problem.  He
has been the recipient of services provided by his mother and his
step-father.
<P>

11	After completing his schooling, the plaintiff attended Liverpool Tafe.  He
completed a number of courses.  He ceased attendance
at Tafe when no further
courses were available to him.  His attempts at obtaining employment have been
unsuccessful and he is presently
unemployed.  In 1997, he undertook a
four-month work experience programme.  On his behalf, it is said that
realistically he is unemployable.
 In contrast, the defendant contends that he
does have a working capacity.  He has a keen interest in fishing and presently
devotes
much of his time to that activity.
<P>

12	Save for acquaintances formed through fishing activities, the plaintiff has
no friends.  He does not have a girl-friend.  His
mother concedes that he has
the capacity to drive a modified motor vehicle and that the acquisition of a
licence and a vehicle may
remove an impediment to him having a girl-friend.  He
accepts that at some time in the future he will have to live independently
of
his mother and step-father.  He presently lacks the confidence to live on his
own.
<P>

13	Since December 1993, the plaintiff has been receiving a Disability Pension.
He has his own bank account (a savings account).
 The operation of the account
receives some supervision from his mother.
<P>

14	The proceedings were commenced in 1985.  They were brought in the name of
Steven Orle against Trevor William Haines.  The plaintiff
has taken the name of
Steven Strath.  His affairs are now in the hands of the Protective
Commissioner.  His claim is as is now pleaded
in the Amended Statement of Claim
filed in Court on 12 April 1999.  The defendant is now the State of New South
Wales (following
the repeal of the Government and Crown Suits Act 1912).  The
alleged cause of action is founded in negligence.  The defendant denies
negligence and alleges contributory negligence.
<P>

15	Unfortunately, this case now comes on for trial more than fifteen years
after the incident took place.  The fort has been removed.
 It is not
unexpected that witnesses profess to have and in fact have loss of
recollection.  The loss of recollection is of a significant
order.  This takes
on particular importance when the evidence tends to be sparse and throws up
conflicting material.  Two potential
witnesses (Miss Ford who was the School
Principal at the time of the incident and Mrs Jagoe who was a Deputy Principal
at that time)
have died.  Other potential witnesses have not been called.
Witnesses who have been called have not been questioned on relevant matters
which could have been expected to fall within their state of knowledge.  This
was a case that  required a separation of the issues
of liability and quantum
and a determination of the former question at the earliest possible time.  A
fair trial of the liability
question is now a very difficult task.
<P>

16	The plaintiff himself was the first witness called.  He relied on evidence
from his brother, his mother and his step-father.
 Also, he called Mr Ali Akin.
An expert (Mr Pilton a landscape architect) prepared a report (Exhibit J).  He
gave supplementary oral
evidence and was cross-examined.  One of the
plaintiff's medical experts (Dr Middleton) also gave supplementary evidence
(she had
prepared two reports) and was cross-examined.  The defendant called Mr
Manwaring (who is now a Superintendent of Schools and was
the Deputy Principal
responsible for years 3 - 6 in 1984) and Miss Rooney (the plaintiff's class
teacher in the years' 1984 and 1985).
<P>

17	The first question to be addressed is the circumstances of the accident.
The only known eye-witness is Mr Ali Akin.  He was born
in 1973 (about 11 years
of age at the time of the incident).    He lived in a nearby block of units and
was a student at the school
in year 5.  He was not a friend of the plaintiff.
I shall now refer to his oral evidence.  He was playing in the tennis court
area
(roller skating).  He observed the plaintiff playing alone on the fort.
(For completeness, I should mention that during his cross-examination
the
plaintiff rejected the contention that he sometimes played alone).  The
plaintiff had been seen both ascending and descending
the fort on a number of
occasions.  He had been using the means of descent provided by what has been
described as fireman's poles.
 The plaintiff was seen attempting a descent by
means of the poles which led to him falling head-first.  His head made contact
with
the ground surface in the area of the poles.  His body finished up wedged
between the two poles.
<P>

18	Mr Ali Akin had provided a statement to an investigator for the defendant on
22 March 1989 (about 5 years after the incident
and when he was 15 years of
age).  It has been admitted as Exhibit G.  It contains the words, "I can't
remember any pieces of wood
sticking up.  But they might have been there".
<P>

19	 His version of the incident itself was not challenged.  However, there is
issue as to other aspects of his evidence.
<P>

20	Mr Ali Akin had described the ground surface as being of compacted sand. He
said that after the incident sand had been placed
at the base of the fort.
Initially, he could not give an exact date for when this was done.  He later
said it was "a month or so"
after the incident.  In cross-examination, he
initially said that he knew the sand around the fort was not loose.  Later,
when shown
photograph A3, he said "I can't say there is loose sand".  He was
not asked to put his mind to the question of ground surface until
about 9-10
months ago.   He conceded that his recollection had faded since the incident
but maintained that he was 90% sure about
what he said concerning the sand.  He
did not have an accurate recollection as to when the fort was removed.  There
was conflict
between his evidence and what was later said by Mr Manwaring.  Mr
Manwaring said that there was a covering surface of river sand
under the fort,
which was placed there for the purpose of being soft to take the fall of
students.  He described it as being a soft
surface.  It was there prior to the
incident.  He could not be specific as to the depth of the sand.  He believed
that Exhibit A
showed sand at the bottom of the fireman's poles.  He was first
asked to put his mind to the matter of the nature of the surface
in the days
following the incident.
<P>

21	Mr Manwaring had made a statement on 22 November 1985.  It was admitted as
Exhibit 6.  The statement refers to an interview had
with Ali Akin.  It records
that Mr Manwaring was told by Ali Akin "that he had been playing in the tennis
court with a ball".  It
also refers to a statement made to him by the
plaintiff's mother "that another boy had pushed Steven from the climbing
equipment".
<P>

22	Neither of the statements (of Mr Akin and Mr Manwaring) made reference to
the surface at the base of the fort. Neither party
questioned Miss Rooney
concerning this matter.  The position was similar with both Joseph and his
mother.  Mrs Akin (who may have
seen the incident) was not called.  Mr Akin
(the father of Mr Ali Akin) was not called (he was in attendance at the scene
following
the incident).  Mr Milic (an employee who appears to have had
responsibility to maintain playground areas) was not called.  There
is evidence
that he was close to retirement at the time of the incident.  The plaintiff
made a call for any statement made by him.
 No statement was produced by the
defendant.  The plaintiff made a call for photographs held by the defendant.
The photographs produced
in response to this call were made the subject of a
claim for privilege which was not challenged.  The evidence reveals that these
photographs were not shown to Mr Manwaring.  As could be expected, these
matters generated a plethora of submissions from the bar
table.
<P>

23	The evidence demonstrates that the school-grounds were regularly used for
play by children in non-school hours.  Access to the
grounds was easily had by
climbing over the brick fence.  The school had knowledge that children were
playing on the grounds in non-school
hours (there could be up to thirty
children on the grounds when several soccer matches were played in the tennis
court area).  Steps
were taken to prevent this happening.  There was oral
instruction to leave the school grounds given to particular students found
there during non-school periods (including to the plaintiff shortly before the
incident).  The matter was the subject of comment
at school assembly and
newsletters were sent to parents (viz that the school was out of bounds during
non-school hours).  There was
a walk of the perimeter of the school buildings
at the end of the school day.  (One of the purposes of this walk was to ensure
security
of school buildings and contents).
<P>

24	There is material to suggest that prior to the incident the plaintiff may
have been of low average intelligence.  There is material
to suggest that he
had difficulty keeping up with school work.  There was testing carried out in
1982 (it revealed inter alia an
IQ of 84). In year 2 he was functioning in the
bottom 5 of the grade. In reading and mathematics he was operating two years
below
his chronological age.  He was placed in an intellectually mild (IM) or
Opportunity Abnormal  (OA) class prior to the incident (in
February 1984).
There was significant improvement in his skills by the end of 1985.  He
remained in an OA class whilst at primary
school.  There were disciplinary
problems prior to the incident.  By the end of 1985, his behaviour had become
more controlled. 
He was not as popular as some other children were in his
class.
<P>

25	I now turn to the question of liability.  The existence of the alleged duty
of care was not in issue.  Breach of that duty was
in issue.  Ultimately, two
matters were agitated.  The first may be generally described as a matter
concerning the ground surface
at the base of the fort.  The second may be
generally described as a matter concerning one of fencing or access to the fort
during
non-school hours.  The first matter was the one principally relied on by
the plaintiff.
<P>

26	The first matter was not raised until a very late stage in the proceedings.
It was raised by the amendments which appeared in
the Amended Statement of
Claim filed in Court on 12 April 1999.  This pleading contained the fresh
allegation that the ground surface
below the children's fort was a packed earth
surface.  One of the particulars of negligence introduced by this pleading was
failing
to provide or ensure an appropriate ground surface under and around the
equipment.
<P>

27	The original pleading had alleged that the plaintiff's head had struck one
of two logs protruding from the fort.  The amended
pleading alleged that his
head struck either the packed earth surface or one of the logs. 
<P>

28	The case proceeded on the basis that the providing of a soft sand surface
would have been appropriate ground surface.  The question
of fact in issue was
the nature of the actual surface at the time of the incident.  Both Mr Akin and
Mr Manwaring said that the ground
surface was of sand.  The issue of fact
thrown up by their evidence was whether or not it was compacted sand or a soft
sand surface.
<P>

29	At this stage, I should observe that I closely observed the demeanour of all
witnesses.  In assessing credibility, I have taken
both the evidence and
demeanour into account.
<P>

30	It seems to me that the late raising of the ground surface matter may be of
significance in explaining some of the questions
agitated on this issue.  It
may go some way to explain the lack of reference to it in material and the lack
of attention to it otherwise.
For completeness, I should add that there is
history in expert reports which records that the plaintiff's head hit a timber
pole
or a protruding peg.  It may also be observed that whilst the ground
surface may have been seen as a relevant matter, there may have
been initial
focus on the suggestion that the plaintiff had been pushed from the fort and
later focus on the suggestion that he struck
his head on one of the logs.
<P>

31	The fort was a piece of equipment for use by the younger children (it was
placed in the K2 playground area adjacent to the K2
classes) at the school.
The material does not suggest that Mr Akin played on the fort.  When he went to
the fort, his attention may
have been concentrated on the injured plaintiff.
He was then about 11 years of age.  
<P>

32	Mr Manwaring was a school administrator involved in the making of
investigations following the incident.  He inspected the fort
on the following
day (inter alia to view the line of sight from the fort to where Mrs Akin was
standing on her balcony).  It was
initially said that he was a witness who was
not prepared to make concessions.  This submission was later withdrawn.  During
the
course of his evidence, Mr Manwaring both corrected earlier evidence and
made concessions (inter alia concerning his recollection
as to matters such as
the fort and the fence).  However, his evidence remained firm on the matter of
the presence of the sand at
the base of the fort.  He gave me the impression of
a witness doing his best to give honest and reliable evidence.  
<P>

33	Both parties contend that Exhibit A gives support to their respective case.
In my view, these photographs afford little assistance
on this issue.  At best
they may be regarded as giving an ambiguous impression.  There are problems
occasioned by under-exposure
and the presence of shading.  At the very least it
can be said what is depicted by the photographs is not inconsistent with what
has been said by Mr Manwaring.
<P>

34	It is not said that either of the witnesses has set out to deceive the
Court.  It is crucial to the case of the plaintiff that
Mr Akin's evidence be
preferred to that given by Mr Manwaring.  The Court is asked by the plaintiff
to not accept Mr Manwaring's
evidence.
<P>

35	I am not satisfied that I should prefer the evidence given by Mr Akin to
that given by Mr Manwaring.  I reject the submission
that I should not accept
Mr Manwaring's evidence on this question.  For completeness, I shall add that I
prefer the evidence given
by Mr Manwaring to that given by Mr Akin.  These
findings are decisive on the principal matter argued in respect of the
allegation
of breach of duty.
<P>

36	I now turn to the other matter argued on the question of breach of duty.
Whilst this matter was not abandoned, it was not argued
with great vigour.  One
problem for the plaintiff is that this matter received a lack of support from
his own expert.  In Exhibit
J, Mr Pilton said inter alia;-
<P>

	"Finally there is the question about the propriety of the school failing to
construct an adequate fence to exclude young children
from using the school
grounds after hours.  To be fully effective such a fence would have to have the
physical (and therefore aesthetic)
attributes of a prison fence which would be
unlikely to be acceptable in today's world where schools are intended to be
`warm and
friendly' places!"
<P>

37	I have already made mention of the steps taken by the school to prevent
children from entering upon the school premises during
non-school hours.  I
should also mention that during a routine perimeter walk, the plaintiff had
been found on the premises between
4 and 4.15 pm on a day in early March 1984.
He had been asked to leave.
<P>

38	I am not satisfied the part of the case founded on this matter has been made
out.  In my view, the plaintiff also fails on this
matter.
<P>

39	The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the Court that he has a cause of
action (on the balance of probabilities).  In my
view, he has failed to satisfy
the Court that there was a breach of duty.
<P>

40	Whilst the findings that have been made dispose of the question of
liability, I should mention two other matters which were agitated
by the
parties.  Firstly, there was a question of causation.  Secondly, there was a
defence of contributory negligence.
<P>

41	Mr Pilton provides the only expert material on the question of liability.
He did not have the advantage of inspecting the fort.
 He appears to have
prepared his report on an implicit  assumption that there was a hard surface at
the base of the fort.  His report
is founded on the premise that the ground
surface around the structure was inherently dangerous (the basis for this
premise is not
specified).  He was cross-examined at some length.  He conceded
that any of the measures proposed by him and a soft sand surface
("safe falling
zones") do not serve the purpose of preventing injury.  He said that "The idea
is to reduce the severity of injury".
 They do not exclude the possibility of a
significant injury for someone falling head first on to the surface (be it
rubber matting,
pea gravel, soft sand or pine bark). Both parties have referred
the Court to passages in the judgments delivered in <u>Chappel v Hart</u> 72
ALJR 1344.
<P>

42	It has been said that causation is a complex and controversial problem.  The
plaintiff is required to prove that the breach of
duty by the defendant caused
the particular damage that the plaintiff suffered.  Causation is essentially a
question of fact to be
resolved as a matter of common sense (<u>Fitzgerald v
Penn</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/74.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 74</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 268</a> at 277-278).  It arises in the context of
attributing responsibility for the damage that has occurred.
<P>

43	In this case, the only expert is of limited expertise.  The plaintiff's case
has its other evidentiary deficiencies.  In my view,
if the plaintiff had been
able to prove breach of duty, I would not have been satisfied that he could
demonstrate the requisite causation
between such breach of duty and the damage
suffered.  
<P>

44	I shall just mention some of the matters relied on by the defendant in
propounding the defence of contributory negligence.  It
was said that there was
material indicating that the plaintiff had been shown by staff how to use the
fort.  Further, it was said
that his use of the fort prior to the incident
demonstrated that he knew how to use it.  It is finally said that the plaintiff
did
not show sufficient regard for his own safety and that this contributed to
his injury and that if a finding of negligence was made
the plaintiff should
bear responsibility up to 30%. Apart from joining issue on these matters,
counsel for the plaintiff placed emphasis
on the youth of the plaintiff.  In
the light of the findings made, it is unnecessary to proceed further with a
consideration of this
matter.
<P>

45	Although the question of liability has been determined adversely to the
plaintiff, there is authority for the view that the Court
should in appropriate
cases still proceed to express its views on the question of quantum.
<P>

46	The plaintiff propounds a very  large claim (in the order of at least
$2,300,000) which comprises numerous heads of damage. 
Both parties have
prepared a schedule of damages.
<P>

47	Subject to the question of liability, there is consensus as to two heads of
damage only (out-of-pocket expenses in the sum of
$3,395.75 and cost of future
treatment in the sum of $34,315.56).  Apart from this consensus, there is some
common ground as to inter
alia rates and periods of time.  The principal areas
of dispute concern general damages, past economic loss, future economic loss,
past care and future care.  The distance between the parties is enormous.  In
addition to these matters, there are lesser disputes
concerning matters such as
transport costs and the quantum of the costs to be allowed for the build-up of
the plaintiff's shoes.
<P>

48	The plaintiff claims that the incident had left him with both a reduced
intellectual capacity and physical disabilities.  The
question of the severity
of the physical disabilities has aroused little dispute.  The real contest
concerns the question of the
alleged reduction in intellectual capacity caused
by the head injury in the incident.  On behalf of the plaintiff, it is seen in
terms of a reduction from low average to border-line retarded.  Largely, the
defendant takes the view that if there was any reduction
in intellectual
capacity it was not of significance. 
<P>

49	The resolution of disputes of this nature is usually a difficult task.  The
present case is no exception.  It suffices to merely
mention some of the
problems.  The plaintiff suffered the severe head injury at a young age.  At
the time of the injury, he suffered
from intellectual deficits.  Relevant
expert opinion has been founded on erroneous history and/or without the benefit
of material
of importance. 
<P>

50	The plaintiff's material presents a picture of a person who has inter alia
no realistic potential for work and needs future care
because of the
combination of the intellectual deficits and physical disabilities suffered
because of the incident.  Largely, the
material provides little assistance in
differentiating that part of the claimed loss which is attributable to the
plaintiff's physical
disabilities as opposed to that part which flows from any
reduction in intellectual capacity.
<P>

51	In the presentation of the plaintiff's case particular stress is placed on
the material provided by Dr Langeluddecke, Dr Gilandas
and Dr Middleton.  Dr
Langeluddecke prepared a report dated 25 June 1986.  The report relied on a
history provided by the plaintiff's
mother (inter alia in relation to
pre-accident personality functioning and premorbid mental functioning).  The
history was not consistent
with the evidence given at the trial (this meant
inter alia that her assessment of the plaintiff's premorbid level of
intellectual
functioning was based on at least average academic achievements
prior to his head injury).  Dr Gilandas has provided three reports
(the first
was dated 27 May 1995).  He had a history that the plaintiff was reputedly of
low average intelligence pre-accident. 
He proceeded on the basis that IQ tests
of children below the age of 8 tend to be unreliable.  His testing suggested
that the then
intellectual functioning of the plaintiff approached the
borderline mentally retarded range.  Both Dr Langeluddecke and Dr Gilandas
took
the view that the head injury had a significant effect on the plaintiff's
pre-incident difficulties.  The plaintiff's expert
material has to be seen in
the context of the defendant's expert material together with the school records
and the evidence of Miss
Rooney.  Miss Rooney was an impressive witness.  She
said that during the 5 weeks prior to the incident the plaintiff seemed to be
appropriately placed in the OA class.  She took the view that the plaintiff had
the prospect of improvement but only to a certain
level.  The plaintiff's
experts do not appear to have had the advantage of the school material.  Whilst
the school records should
be treated with caution, they afford guidance as to
future potential.
<P>

52	The severity of the head injury of itself gives support to the view that the
incident may have led to some loss of intellectual
functioning.  There is
evidence which reinforces that view.  However, I am not satisfied that it leads
to a position where the Court
can identify the extent of that loss with any
precision.  On balance, the best that the Court can do in the circumstances is
to find
that there is some loss of functioning attributable to the incident.
<P>

53	I am not satisfied that the injury attributable to the incident has left the
plaintiff devoid of residual earning capacity. 
There is some capacity.  The
range of work available may not be large and may be of a restricted nature.
Clearly, the plaintiff is
in a position of significant disadvantage in the open
labour market.
<P>

54	The assessment task in this case would be complex and time consuming.  If an
assessment were to be made, it would in many respects
be arbitrary in nature.
This would be the best that the Court could do in the circumstances of this
case.  In the light of the views
expressed on the question of liability, it
seems to me that there is a present lack of utility in pursuing that task in
this case.
<P>

55	There will be judgment for the defendant.  The plaintiff to pay the costs of
the proceedings.  Exhibits may be returned.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-55 are the reasons for judgment of Master
Malpass.
