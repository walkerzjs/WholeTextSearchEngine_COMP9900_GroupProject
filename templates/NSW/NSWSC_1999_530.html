<P>

<P>

<b>MONDAY 31  MAY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>109172/93 - PAULINE MARLY PAHLOW-SILADY V JOHN SILADI;  RE ESTATE OF STEPHEN
SILADY</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>  This is an application for an adjournment of a matter
that has been in this court's list since 1993.  It has already had one trial
and been to the Court of Appeal.  It is ready to be heard tomorrow.  The court
conducted a pre-trial on 4 May 1999 and there was
apparently nothing that would
stop it being heard.
<P>

2	 However, last week I was told that in fact the plaintiff was allegedly
mentally ill.  There was no medical evidence. Today I
have been given a
photostat document, which appears to be signed by Magistrate Jerram,  but the
"Reasons for Decision" portion of
the order, mandatory under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental
Health Act 1990</a> has not been filled in.
<P>

3	I am told that it is not the custom of magistrates these days to give written
reasons; that they put their reasons on tape to
be transcribed later.  That
does not appear to be in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53.</a>  That section requires the
reasons to be written.  A magistrate may give oral orders or directions which
are to be recorded, but
his or her reasons are to be recorded in writing.  This
does not mean whenever the transcription service gets round to transcribing
them, but forthwith or within a reasonably short time after they are given.  As
more than a fortnight has now passed, a reasonable
time has well and truly
expired.
<P>

4	Although most cases such as the present are doubtless seen as routine, the
law is extremely tender where an order is made restricting
the liberty of the
subject even for protective reasons and statutes allowing for detention must be
strictly observed.  As well as
that principle, in this case, it is necessary to
have the reasons for other curial purposes.  As the Protective Judge, I am
perhaps
more sensitive to proper requirements being met than others might be.
Both because the section has not been complied with and because
of the lack of
any other proper medical evidence this Court is put in the impossible position
of not knowing what is the real state
of the plaintiff's health.
<P>

5	I trust that this judgment will be brought to the attention of the learned
Magistrate and that we may have the benefit of her
reasons by next Monday, 7
June 1999.  I have put the matter in the call over for 9 June 1999, but I will
need to know next Monday,
by an affidavit from a medical practitioner, what is
the plaintiff's prognosis.
<P>

6	The matter will go into the call over on 9 June 1999 before the Registrar and
in my Probate and Protective List next Monday, 7
June 1999.
<P>

 
<P>

                                      oOo
