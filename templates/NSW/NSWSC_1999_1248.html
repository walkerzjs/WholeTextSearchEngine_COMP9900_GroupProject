<P>

<b>13 DECEMBER 1999</b>
<P>

<center><b><u>70073/98  -  R  v  Steve RISTESKI</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	On being arraigned for the murder of
Hayden Lee Wederell, the prisoner pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter, which
the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment,
the basis of the plea being death by unlawful and dangerous act without
any
intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.
<P>

2   	Between 2 am and 3 am on Sunday 12 October 1997 the
prisoner, with a group of friends from the Pascoe Vale Soccer Club in Victoria,
went to the Sydney Harbour Casino to watch a televised soccer World Cup
qualifying match between England and Italy.  The matter concluded
a little
after 6.30 am and England qualified to continue to the next round.
<P>

3   	A large group of people who had been watching the match
began to cheer and chant.  This group included English tourists among
whom was
the victim.  Some of the prisoner's friends supported England and some
supported Italy.  There were some verbal exchanges
between some of the
prisoner's group and some of the English tourists.  A glass was thrown from the
area occupied by the English
tourists into the area occupied by the prisoner
and his friends.  This then led to a confrontation between the prisoner's group
and
some of the English tourists.  Blows were exchanged.
<P>

4   	The victim became engaged in a verbal exchange with a
friend of the prisoner and while he was looking at and concentrating
on that
person, the prisoner mounted a small stage on which the victim was standing and
struck him with a very heavy punch to the
side of his neck near his left ear.
The victim then appeared to stagger.  He walked a short distance and collapsed
unconscious on
the floor.  As the victim was falling to the floor, the prisoner
threw a punch at him.  The prisoner then kicked at the head area
of the victim
while he was on the floor in an unconscious state.  There was no physical
evidence that either the second punch or
the kicks connected with the
victim.
<P>

5   	The prisoner then punched two other persons to the head
area and kicked one of those persons in the head area when that person
was on
the floor.
<P>

6   	Casino staff subdued the prisoner and held him until the
arrival of police.  The incident was recorded on the Casino security
video and
clearly shows the prisoner carrying out the assaults upon the victim and other
people as described.
<P>

7   	The prisoner was conveyed to the City Central Detectives'
Office where he later consented to take part in an electronically
recorded
interview in which he stated he could not remember the events of earlier that
morning.  He was shown the video of the incidents
and adopted his actions as
seen on the video.  He said that he had a drinking problem which he offered as
an explanation for his
behaviour.
<P>

8   	He was then charged with maliciously inflicting grievous
bodily harm and affray.
<P>

9   	The victim stopped breathing whilst at the Casino and
received treatment from Casino and ambulance personnel before he was
transported to St Vincent's Hospital where he survived in a coma until he died
on 15 October 1997.  When the prisoner was informed
of his death and that he
would be charged with murder, he said he was very remorseful and did not intend
to kill anyone.
<P>

10   	It is true that the prisoner went to the Casino with his
friends for the purpose of watching the telecast of the World Cup
football
match, and immediately before the glass was thrown, he can be seen on the video
calmly minding his own business, watching
the video screen and sipping his
drink, but once the glass landed in the vicinity of the prisoner and his
friends, all hell broke
loose and an all in brawl quickly developed involving a
large number of persons into which the prisoner charged with enthusiasm,
and he
jumped up onto a small low stage to throw a haymaker punch at the victim.
<P>

11   	Not only was the blow delivered with considerable force
(which can be seen on the video) but it struck the victim in the upper
left
sterno mastoid muscle behind the left ear which resulted in a basal
subarachnoid haemorrhage leading to a loss of blood flow
in the artery beyond
the atlas and thus caused his death.
<P>

12   	The prisoner clearly had no intention to kill or seriously
injure the deceased or anyone else, but could not resist the chance
to join in
the fight and went out of his way to deliver the fatal blow.  Although the
death was not deliberate or intentional, the
unlawful dangerous act, namely the
assault, certainly was.
<P>

13   	There is no evidence that the deceased or any of his
friends threw the glass that led to the brawl, and even if he or one
of them
had, it would be no excuse for the prisoner's actions.  The result is that a
young man in the prime of his life, aged 26
years, a visitor to this country,
has had his life cut short and his family have been left without him and
saddened by such loss.
 The prisoner must bear responsibility for what has
happened which is indeed a tragedy for both the victim and the prisoner, but
for the victim and his family the tragedy is permanent.
<P>

14   	Although no weapon was used and only a single blow caused
the death, the whole of the surrounding circumstances must be taken
into
account including the prisoner's attempts to further punch the deceased and his
efforts of kicking at him whilst he was on the
ground.
<P>

15   	The prisoner was born on 16 March 1975 and he was aged 22
at the time of the offence and is now 24 years.  He resides in Preston,
a
suburb of Melbourne, with his parents and brother.  At the time of the offence
he was an apprentice cabinet maker and he has since
completed that
apprenticeship and is in permanent employment in his trade.  His employer gave
evidence and spoke highly of him as
an employee.  His brother also is a cabinet
maker employed by a different employer, although the two of them have hopes of
eventually
going into business on their own account.
<P>

16   	In the meantime they have jointly purchased a house as an
investment to provide for their futures.  His mother and father
are both in
regular employment and I am satisfied that he comes from a close knit family
and has their support. They were all present
for the sentencing proceedings as
were a number of his friends from the soccer club.  He has played club soccer
for a number of years
and in the season just completed before this tragedy, was
named best and fairest in the club's reserve grade.
<P>

17   	He was previously before the courts in 1994, when aged 19,
on charges of theft and attempted theft for which he received a
community based
order for twelve months without convictions being recorded, and on 14 March
1996 for driving with excess of the prescribed
concentration of alcohol, 0.134
percent, for which he was fined and disqualified from holding a licence.  
<P>

18   	I do not regard the former as relevant for present
purposes but the latter is indicative of excessive drinking, at least when
driving, and is consistent with his answers in the recorded interview that he
was drunk at the time and also that when he drinks
he cannot remember (A.
68).
<P>

19   	When asked why he acted as he did, he replied: "Too much
alcohol" (A. 142), and that he had an alcohol problem (A. 163). 
The alcohol
does not mitigate the seriousness of the offence or excuse it, although it does
go some way to explaining it.
<P>

20   	The prisoner was discharged at committal because the
Magistrate had reservations as to whether the pathologist's evidence
could
establish that the cause of death was the blow thrown by the prisoner, and he
was arraigned pursuant to an ex officio indictment.
 I am informed that
although the Crown had offered to accept a plea to manslaughter, the cause of
death remained a live issue and
it was only on the morning of the trial, after
being shown further material by the Crown, that a plea was indicated.  Such
plea acknowledges
that the death did not result from an accident but that the
act which caused the death, that is the punch, was deliberate, unlawful
and
dangerous:  <b><i>R v MacDonald</i></b> (unreported - CCA - 12 December
1995).
<P>

21   	Although late, the plea indicates acceptance of
responsibility for the death and demonstrates remorse.  It also saves the
State
the expense of a trial and saves the victim's mother, who has travelled from
England, the ordeal and stress of sitting through
detailed evidence and I give
credit for the plea, although not as much as if it had been indicated
earlier.
<P>

22   	The prisoner was arrested on 12 October 1997 and remained
in custody until allowed bail on 26 November 1997.  He was returned
to custody
on the 2nd of this month and has therefore spent the equivalent of eight weeks
in custody to date.
<P>

23   	Manslaughter is always a serious crime as it involves the
felonious taking of a human life:  <b><i>R v Blacklidge</i></b> (unreported -
CCA - 12 December 1995) per Gleeson CJ.  The protection of human life and
personal safety is a primary objective of
the system of criminal justice, and
the value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its
expectations of that
system:  <b><i>R v MacDonald</i></b> supra.  It is
therefore necessary to impose a sentence that takes into account the
community's denunciation of such conduct and general
and personal deterrence,
as well as having regard to the rehabilitation of the prisoner.  Deterrence
(general and personal) is relevant,
notwithstanding the lack of pre meditation
and intention, because it must be demonstrated to the community generally, and
to the
prisoner in particular, that persons must not get into brawls, lose
their temper or throw punches at other people lest tragic and
disastrous,
though unintentional, consequences result as happened here.
<P>

24   	I have read the letter from the deceased's mother and note
the sadness and devastating effects on the family. However, in
accordance with
authority, the sentence has not been increased on account of the effects of his
death on his immediate family.
<P>

25   	I have been referred to a number of cases and also had
regard to the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission, but bearing
in mind
that manslaughter covers such a wide range of criminal responsibility, such
statistics can only be of very limited assistance.
 With these reservations in
mind, I note that in the case of prisoners pleading guilty with no prior
convictions, 80 percent of them
received minimum terms of between 18 months and
6 years, and full terms of 3&#189; to 10 years.
<P>

26   	In addition to the matters referred to above, I consider
the prisoner's prospect of rehabilitation excellent because of his
close and
supporting family, his trade qualification and prospects of gainful employment
on release, his involvement in competitive
sport and the support of his
friends.
<P>

27   	Nevertheless, I consider that special circumstances exist
justifying a variation from the ratio of additional to minimum term
referred to
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pta1982359/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(3)</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a></i></b> because of his youth, as the
fact that it is his first time in prison, and because, his parents live in
Melbourne and due to limited
means will be unable to travel to New South Wales
to visit him regularly, his time in custody will be more onerous unless and
until
he is moved to Victoria under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pta1982359/" class="autolink_findacts">Prisoners (Interstate) Transfer
Act 1982</a></i></b>.
<P>

28   	In all the circumstances, I consider that the appropriate
sentence is one of a minimum term of 3&#189; years with an additional
term of 2
years, but I will make allowance for the period of nearly 2 months spent in
custody prior to today.
<P>

29   	Steve Risteski, for the manslaughter of Hayden Lee
Wederell, I sentence you to penal servitude for a minimum term of 3 years
and 4
months which shall date from today.  I fix an additional term of 2 years.  The
earliest date on which you will be eligible
for release on parole will be 12
April 2003.  The exhibits may be returned.
