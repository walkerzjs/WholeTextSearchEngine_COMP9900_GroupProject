<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Tuesday, 23 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3970/96	PETER WESTGARTH DRINKWATER   -v-   CADDYRACK PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   There is presently before me an
application made by the fifth and six defendants, Gedrot Pty Ltd and Gavros Pty
Ltd, by which they
seek leave to reopen their case in respect to the enquiry as
to the valuation of shares the hearing of which took place last Thursday,
18
March 1999 before me and in respect of which the parties are to serve written
submissions.
<P>

2   	In order to understand the nature of the present
application it is necessary that I should rehearse, at least in summary, the
procedural history of this matter.  The substantive hearing took place before
Mr Justice Young in September 1997.  Subsequently,
on 28 November 1997 his
Honour made certain orders, one of which was to require the purchase by the
fifth and sixth defendants of
certain shares in the first defendant by the
first and second plaintiffS.  His Honour directed an enquiry as to the
valuation of
those shares at a specific date and ordered that the fifth and
sixth defendant pay for the purchase of those shares the valuation
found upon
such enquiry as at that date.
<P>

3   	Subsequently the matter was listed on callover on 25
November 1998 and was specially fixed to be heard by me on Tuesday 1 February
1999, the estimated length of hearing being one day.
<P>

4   	On callover on 25 November 1998 the parties involved in the
enquiry either expressly or at least by implication assured the
Court that the
matter was in a state of total readiness for hearing.  However on 1 February
1999 an application was made by the relevant
defendants for a vacation of the
hearing date (which had in the interim been altered to 2 February 1999).  That
application to vacate
the hearing date was opposed by the plaintiffs.
Nevertheless I acceded to the application to vacate the hearing date, and made
certain
orders and directions of a procedural nature to ensure that when the
matter came on for hearing there would be no ground for any
further adjournment
and that the parties would be without doubt in a state of complete readiness
for that hearing.
<P>

5   	The orders which I made on 1 February contemplated that the
matter would be heard by me in February on a date to be fixed by
arrangement
with my Associate.  Ultimately that date was fixed for last Thursday, 18 March
1999.  I also ordered that the defendants
on or before 22 February 1999 serve
upon the plaintiffs all affidavits of valuation of the shares referred to in
the order made on
28 November 1997. 
<P>

6   	I made certain costs orders in favour of the plaintiffs and
against the defendants and granted leave to the plaintiffs to proceed
forthwith
to assessment of those costs.
<P>

7   	The matter came on for hearing before me on Thursday, 18
March 1999.  The hearing occupied from 10.35am until 4.05pm.  The
oral evidence
had concluded by that time, but Counsel for the respective parties had not
embarked upon their submissions.  Accordingly
I made the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I direct the plaintiff to serve written submissions on or before 25 March
1999 and the defendants to serve written submissions
in reply on or before 1
April 1999.
<P>

(2)	I adjourn the hearing, part-heard, to Monday 12 April 1999.
<P>

8   	Within a day of the hearing on 18 March the legal
representatives of the fifth and sixth defendants sought to have the matter
listed before me for the purpose of making an application for leave to be given
to re-open their case upon the enquiry.  The matter
has been listed this day,
23 March 1999, for that purpose.  
<P>

9   	The application that the fifth and sixth defendants have
leave to reopen their case upon the enquiry is opposed by the first
and second
plaintiffs.  The ground upon which the application is made appears to be that
certain material upon which Mr Stefan Shane
Pritchard, an accountant, relied,
was not apparently annexed to his affidavit.  There is no suggestion that the
material was not
available to Mr Pritchard at the time of the hearing or that
he was unaware of that material.
<P>

10   	The suggestion seems to be made by the defendants that the
plaintiffs might have been confused or misled by the absence of
that material.
That is a matter for the plaintiffs, and if they do not wish to avail
themselves of what, in those terms, appears
to be a benevolent offer by the
defendants, then I do not see why they should be forced to do so.  I am not
persuaded that anything
in the various affidavits which have been relied upon
in support of the application to re-open the evidence for the defendants
justifies
such a re-opening.
<P>

11   	The Court is required to do justice between both parties.
What the defendants now seek to do would, in effect, require a further
hearing
of the matter.  It would require this additional material to be placed before
the plaintiffs' experts.  It would require
further cross-examination of Mr
Pritchard on behalf of the plaintiffs.  It might require additional evidence by
the plaintiffs' experts,
Mr Griffiths and Mr Hewitt.  It would certainly
require considerable additional hearing time to be allocated to the matter.  It
is
unlikely that the date of 12 April which has been reserved for the further
hearing could be appropriately retained.  There has already
been one vacated
hearing of this matter, vacated at the instance of the defendants, who are
making the present application.
<P>

12   	There was an express order made on 1 February 1999 that
the defendants on or before 22 February 1999 serve upon the plaintiffs
all
affidavits of valuation of the shares referred to in the order of Mr Justice
Young of 28 November 1997.  What those defendants
are attempting now to do is
to have yet a further opportunity of placing additional material before the
Court, material which should
have been filed and served in its entirety before
the callover on 25 November 1998, which at the latest should have been
available
immediately before the hearing fixed for 2 February 1999, and which
(by a concession of the Court, opposed by the plaintiffs) was
allowed to be
provided up to 22 February 1999. More than a month after that date and after
the hearing of oral evidence has been
completed, the time for the providing of
such further material is now further extended.  I refuse the application of the
fifth and
sixth defendants to re-open their case.  I make the following
orders:
<P>

1.	I refuse the application of the fifth and sixth defendants that they have
leave to re-open their case in the enquiry before me.
<P>

2.	I order that the fifth and sixth defendants pay the costs of the first and
second plaintiffs of the aforesaid application.
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the first and second plaintiffs to proceed forthwith to
assessment of the foregoing costs.
<P>
