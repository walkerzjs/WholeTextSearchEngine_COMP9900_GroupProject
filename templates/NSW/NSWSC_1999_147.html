<b>12144/98   -   G H HEALEY &amp; COMPANY - BONDI  v</b>
<P>

<b>			VINCENT GRASSO</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Appeal against a costs assessor's decision)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by summons filed 1 September 1998
seeks to appeal against the determination of costs made by the costs assessor
Mr
Leonard Hattersley on 4 August 1998.  These grounds of appeal are set out.
The plaintiff relied on the affidavits of Katarina Muc
sworn 1 September 1998,
16 November 1998 and 29 March 1999.  The defendant relied on the affidavits of
Peter Allan La Fontaine sworn
3 December, 1998 and Aaron Morgenstern sworn 17
February 1999.  The grounds of appeal are set out in Ms Muc's earlier
affidavit.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff is a firm of solicitors.  The defendant is a former
client of the plaintiff.  Leonard S Hattersley is the costs
assessor to whom
this matter was referred for assessment.  The summons filed on 1 September 1998
named "G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi"
as the plaintiff and "Vincent Grasso" as
the first defendant.  
<P>

3  	As preliminary issues, the defendant submitted that these
proceedings were brought improperly as the parties were incorrect.
 Firstly,
the defendant submitted that the plaintiff was incorrectly described and
secondly that Leonard Hattersley had been joined
as a second defendant without
the leave of the court which is not in accordance with s 208NA of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal
Profession Act</a> </b>1987.  I delivered reasons in relation to these two issues
on 8 March 1999.  I decided that Mr Leonard Hattersley the costs assessor
had
not been joined as a second defendant in these proceedings.  The matter was
relisted to give the plaintiff an opportunity to
seek leave to amend its name
if necessary.  In response, the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking that
leave be granted pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> or Part 20
of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> to amend the name of the plaintiff on the
summons from "G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi" to "Katarina Muc trading as G H
Healey &amp;
Co-Bondi (formerly known as G H Healey &amp; Co (Bondi))".
<P>

4  	Ms Muc deposed that on 15 July 1991 she received instructions to
act for the defendant in relation to a claim for damages. 
At that time she was
an employed solicitor of "G H Healey &amp; Co" operating from premises at
Coogee.  Ms Muc had the day to day
conduct of the matter under the supervision
of one of the partners of the firm, Gregory Harrison Healey.  There is no
evidence as
to who were the partners of G H Healey &amp; Co as at 15 July
1991.
<P>

5  	On 1 July 1995 Ms Muc became a partner with Mr Healey.  She also
became the resident principal of the practice which they conducted
at Bondi and
styled " G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi".  On 31 December 1997 Mr Healey resigned
from the partnership.  Ms Muc continued
to practice as the sole proprietor from
1 January 1998.  The business name "G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi" was registered
to Ms Muc
on 28 January 1998.  
<P>

6  	The defendant's substantive claim conducted in the District Court
was concluded at a time when Mr Healey and Ms Muc were partners
of "G H Healey
&amp; Co - Bondi".  In October 1996 when the verdict moneys were received, Mr
Healey and Ms Muc were partners of "G
H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi".  On 1
September 1998 the proceedings for the assessment of costs were commenced.  At
this time Ms Muc
was the sole proprietor of the practice styled "G H Healey
&amp; Co - Bondi".  
<P>

7  	The confusion with the proper name of the plaintiff in the costs
assessment and these proceedings starts with the application
form.  Mr Grasso
nominated "G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi" as the defendant at the top of the
application form but at para (5) of that
same document he nominated the
defendant as "G H Healey &amp; Co" and gave the Bondi address.  
<P>

8  	The bill dated 13 March 1998 was prepared by the plaintiff and
signed by Ms Muc, solicitor as the principal of "G H Healey &amp;
Co - Bondi".
It refers to a debit to "G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi".  The reply filed by the
plaintiff cites its firm name as "G H
Healey &amp; Co - Bondi".  Correspondence
passing between the defendant and the costs assessor is written on "G H Healey
&amp; Co
- Bondi" letterhead but refers to the matter of Grasso v G H Healey
&amp; Co, Solicitors.
<P>

9  	On 2 December 1997 the proper officer at the Supreme Court for
costs assessment wrote to the parties informing them that the
matter had been
referred to Mr Leonard Hattersley for the costs assessment.  The letter from
the proper officer referred to the defendant
as being "G H Healey &amp; Co
Solicitors".  The certificate of assessment of costs dated 4 May 1998 named
"Gregory H Healey" practising
as "G H Healey &amp; Co" as the defendant.
<P>

10  	Part 64 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> refers to business
names.  Part 64 r 1 defines "business names" as:
<P>

<b>"A name, style title or designation under which a person carries on a
business, not being a name consisting of the name of that person
and the name
of each other person, if any, in association with whom that person carries on
business, without any addition."</b>
<P>

11  	Part 64 r 2 does not apply because the business name was
registered before the assessment of costs proceedings were commenced.
<P>

12  	Part 64 r 4 states:
<P>

<b>"Appearance</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Where any person is sued in a business name, he shall not enter an
appearance except in his own name.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Where any person enters an appearance in proceedings in which he is sued
in a business name, he shall file and serve with his
notice of appearance a
statement of the names and places of residence of all the persons carrying on
business under that business
name on the date of commencement of the
proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	Where a person fails to comply with subrule (2), the Court may order
that his appearance be struck out."</b>
<P>

13  	In the costs assessment proceedings, the defendant firm of
solicitors appears not to have complied with the above rules.  If
it had, these
current difficulties would not have arisen.  
<P>

14  	Part 64 r 5 provides:
<P>

<b>"Amendment as to parties</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Where proceedings are commenced against any person in a business name,
the plaintiff shall, as soon as practicable, take all reasonable
steps (whether
by way of discovery of documents, interrogatories or otherwise) for the purpose
of ascertaining the name of the defendant
and shall, so far as practicable,
make amendments so that the proceedings are continued against the person sued
in his own name and
not in his business name.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Where proceedings are commenced against any person in a business name,
the plaintiff shall not, without the leave of the Court,
take any step in the
proceedings, except in respect of service of the originating process and except
for the purpose of compliance
with subrule (1), until amendments are made in
accordance with subrule (1).</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	Where an amendment is made under this rule, the mode of amendment and
service after amendment shall be in accordance with rules
7, 8 and 9 of Part
20.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	A party may make any amendment pursuant to rule 2 of Part 20
notwithstanding that he has made an amendment under this rule."</b>
<P>

15  	In the costs assessment proceedings, the plaintiff Mr Grasso did
not comply with this rule.  In the appeal, the plaintiff firm
of solicitors did
not comply with this rule.  Once again if either party had complied with this
rule, the current difficulties would
not have arisen.  The name of the
defendant should have been changed to Katarina Muc who should have been sued in
her own name.
<P>

16  	The costs assessor probably cognisant with requirements of Part
64 realised that the name "G H Healey &amp; Co - Bondi" was
incorrect so added
the words "Gregory H Healey practising as" before "G H Healey &amp; Co" on the
certificate of determination of
costs when naming the plaintiff.  At the foot
of the certificate the costs assessor referred to "G H Healey &amp; Co" at the
Bondi
postal address.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff was correctly
described in the summons whereas the defendant submitted that the
plaintiff was
correctly described in the certificate of determination of costs.  The
plaintiff is not correctly described on the
summons as "G H Healey &amp; Co -
Bondi" because that description does not comply with Part 64 r 5(1).
<P>

18  	As previously stated, it is my view that the correct name of the
plaintiff in the costs assessment proceedings should have
been Katarina Muc.
The application for the costs assessment, the certificate of determination in
the costs assessment proceedings
name the defendant incorrectly.  The summons
in these proceedings names the incorrect plaintiff.  This raises two questions,
firstly
whether the application and the certificate can be amended and secondly
whether the summons should be amended.  
<P>

19  	The plaintiff referred to s 208K of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act</a></b> and noted that this section refers to the application.  It provides:
<P>

<b>"Determination to be final </b>
<P>

<b>A costs assessor's determination of an application is binding on all parties
to the application and no appeal lies in respect of the
determination, except
as provided by this division."</b>
<P>

20  	Likewise <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s204.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 204</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> also refers to
an application.  It provides:
<P>

<b>"Persons to be notified of application</b>
<P>

<b>The proper officer of the Supreme Court is to cause a copy of an application
for assessment to be given to any barrister, solicitor
or client concerned or
any other person whom the proper officer thinks it appropriate to
notify."</b>
<P>

21  	The defendant submitted that the court has power to remedy the
costs assessor's error by a declaration correcting the application
and
certificate.  According to the plaintiff, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208K</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act</a></b>, properly construed, means that all parties to the original application
for assessment for costs are bound by the certificate of
determination.  In
this case the parties named in the original application for assessment are "G H
Healey &amp; Co - Bondi" and "Vince
Grasso".  According to the plaintiff, by
force of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> it is the party to an application who can appeal.  The right of
appeal as conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> is conferred on the parties to the application,
and the costs assessor cannot by accidental slip of a pen or otherwise confer a
right
of appeal on someone who is not a party, or on a non-existent party, by
mistakenly naming that person in the certificate.  Even if
these submissions
are correct, the plaintiff was incorrectly named in the application so amending
the certificate to reflect the
plaintiff's name recorded in the application
will not assist it.
<P>

22  	The plaintiff also submitted that an amendment could be made by
virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L(2)</a>
provides:
<P>

<b>"(2)	After deciding the question the subject of the appeal, the Supreme
Court may, unless it affirms the costs assessor's decision:
</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs assessor, or </b>
<P>

<b>(b)	remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the
costs assessor to re-determine the application."</b>
<P>

23  	However I cannot proceed to decide the question the subject of
appeal unless the proper parties are named in the application.
 This section
does not assist the plaintiff.
<P>

24  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208jb.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208JB</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> provides:
<P>

<b>"Correction of error in determination</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	At any time after making a determination, a costs assessor may, for the
purpose of correcting an inadvertent error in the determination:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	make a new determination in substitution for the previous determination,
and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	issue a certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208j.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208J</a> that sets out the new
determination.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Such a certificate replaces any certificate setting out the previous
determination of the costs assessor that has already been
issued by the costs
assessor, and any judgment that is taken to have been effected by the filing of
that previously issued certificate
is varied accordingly."</b>
<P>

25  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208jb.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208JB</a> commenced on 18 December 1998 and does not apply
to a determination made by a costs assessor prior to its commencement (see
Schedule
of the <b>Legal <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/paa227/" class="autolink_findacts">Profession Amendment Act</a></b> 1998).  The costs
assessor's determination was made on 4 August 1998 so s 208JB does not apply.
Prior to the introduction of s 208JB,
a costs assessor did not have the power
to make a "slip rule" amendment.  In <b><u>Nabatu Pty Limited v Christopher W
Crawley t/as Aubrey F Crawley &amp; Co</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 9 April 1998
at pp 20 and 21) I held that there is nothing in the construction of the Act
that led me to conclude
that there was a right in that statute that permits a
costs assessor to correct his or her mistakes.  When a costs assessor has given
his or her determination, he or she is <i>functus officio</i> and cannot act or
detract from what he or she has done.
<P>

26  	The plaintiff also submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/paa227/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></b> would permit the application and certificate in the costs assessment
proceedings to be amended.  I reproduced this section in my
earlier judgment of
8 March 1999 but it is convenient to reproduce it again here.
<P>

27  	The relevant portions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b>
provide:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where, in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings at any stage
in the court of or in connection with any proceedings,
there is, by reason of
anything done or left undone, a failure to comply with the requirements of this
Act or of the rules whether
in respect of time, place, manner, form or content
or in any other respect -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify
the proceedings, or any step taken in the proceedings, or
any document,
judgment or order in the proceedings;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	subject to subsections (2) and (3), the court may, on terms, set aside
wholly or in part the proceedings or any step taken in
the proceedings or any
document, judgment or order in the proceedings or exercise its powers under
this Act and the rules to allow
amendments and to make orders dealing with the
proceedings generally.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The court shall not set aside any proceedings or any step taken in any
proceedings or any document, judgment or order in any proceedings
on the ground
of a failure to which subsection (1) applies on the application of any party
unless the application is made within
a reasonable time and before the
applicant has taken any fresh step after becoming aware of the
irregularity."</b>
<P>

28  	Also <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p64" class="autolink_findacts">Part 64</a> r 7 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> provides:
<P>

<b>"Variation of judgment or order</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Notwithstanding rule 6, the Court may vary a judgment or order against a
person in a business name so as to make it a judgment
or order against that
person in his own name and, when so varied, the judgment or order may be
enforced accordingly.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Notice of a motion for a variation of a judgment or order under subrule
(1) shall be served personally on the person against whom
the judgment was
given or the order was made, and rule 3 shall not apply to that
service."</b>
<P>

29  	It is my view that s 81(1)(b) gives the court the power to amend
the application and the certificate in the costs assessment
proceedings and the
summons in these proceedings.  Although the section does not specifically refer
to a certificate, the intention
of the section is to allow the court to amend a
FINAL determination.  Once the plaintiff became aware that its correct name was
in
dispute at the hearing and after I delivered my earlier reasons she promptly
filed a notice of motion seeking to correct the error.
 The plaintiff made the
application within a reasonable time and did not take a fresh step after
becoming aware of the irregularity.
 Also it is my view Part 64 r 7 gives the
court power to vary a judgment or order so as to make it a judgment or order
against that
person in his or her own name.
<P>

30  	The defendant did not submit that it would suffer any prejudice
by the amendments.  It must also be remembered that it was
the defendant who
initially named the plaintiff incorrectly but had always intended to sue the
firm of solicitors who conducted his
litigation in the District Court.  The
plaintiff has carried out legal work on his behalf which resulted in a
substantial verdict
in his favour and is entitled to remuneration.  If the
amendments were not made and the certificate could not be varied, the
certificate
could not be enforced.  The assessment process would have been a
useless exercise.  However, for reasons which appear later in the
judgment, the
certificate is to be set aside.  However, it is in the interests of justice and
allowable under s 81 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> and Part 64 r 7 for the
name of the defendant in the costs assessment application to be amended to
Katarina Muc and I so order.
<P>

31  	The summons also should be amended so that the plaintiff is
correctly named as "Katarina Muc" and I make this order.  The appeal
can now be
argued and decided on its merits.
<P>

32  	I turn to consider the appeal itself.  The plaintiff's grounds
of appeal are firstly that the costs assessor, whilst purporting
to determine
the bill of costs dated 13 March 1998 which was the subject of the application,
had actually assessed a previous statement
of account dated 31 October 1996;
secondly the costs assessor assessed the earlier narrative bill rather than the
itemised solicitor/client
bill which was provided to the defendant subsequent
to the defendant filing an application for assessment of costs;  thirdly the
costs assessor even after assessing the earlier narrative bill with the
concession granted of charging pre 1 July 1994 scale charges,
failed to take
into account the appropriate charges which, utilising the scale rates still
produced a figure in excess of $37,000
taking into account the items conceded
by the plaintiff in its replies to the defendant's objections and the items
disallowed by
the costs assessor and finally while purporting to determine the
bill of costs dated 13 March 1998 which was the subject of the application
for
assessment, the costs assessor disregarded the bill in assessable form and
purportedly assessed a previous statement of account
dated 31 October 1996.  At
the hearing the plaintiff also sought leave to appeal firstly on the basis that
there is an error in the
arithmetic in the bill and secondly there was an
obvious manifest error because of the large reduction of the defendant's
costs.
<P>

33  	I turn to give a short history of the relevant matters.
<P>

(1)	On 7 June 1991, the defendant was injured at work.  He suffered a serious
injury to his right foot resulting in the amputation
of three toes and half of
a big toe.
<P>

(2)	On 15 July 1991, the plaintiff took instructions on behalf of the
defendant.  Subsequent proceedings were commenced by the plaintiff
on behalf of
the defendant against his employer.  The matter was listed for hearing in this
court in the Sydney circuit which commenced
on 1 July 1996 for 4 weeks.  On 5
July 1996, the matter commenced before Dunford J.  The matter was settled at
5.00 pm on that day
for $340,000 inclusive of costs.
<P>

(3)	On 1 November 1996, the defendant provided instructions for the payment of
these professional fees by way of a signed authority.
 When the settlement
moneys were received the defendant was provided with a narrative bill dated 31
December 1996 advising of professional
fees in the sum of $29,950 and
disbursements in the sum of $24,245.32.
<P>

(4)	On 13 October 1997, the defendant requested an itemised bill.  On 31
December 1997, the defendant filed an application for an
assessment of costs.

<P>

(5)	On 8 December 1997, the costs assessor wrote to the defendant. He notified
the defendant that he had been appointed the costs
assessor.  The relevant
parts of that letter read:
<P>

<b>"I note the total of the costs and disbursements (including Counsels' fees)
charged by solicitors amounts to $54,192.32.  I note also
you say that only
$25,000 is in dispute but of course you do not specify which part or parts of
the bill you have received make up
that $25,000.00.  Thus it will be necessary
for me to carefully consider <i>the whole of the solicitors' costs and
disbursements</i> before I will be able to come to any decision whether or not
you have been overcharged and if so by what amount (if any).</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>I have cursorily considered the defendants' lump sum narrative bill of costs
and disbursements to you and based on my experience as
a solicitor and costs
assessor I venture the opinion to you that the defendants' solicitors will
readily establish that their fees
and disbursements charged to you in the sum
of $54,192 is more than fair and reasonable particularly in the light of the
gross amount
of the settlement achieved by them and Counsel for you."</b>
<P>

The costs assessor concluded the letter by requesting the defendant to advise
him whether he wished to continue with the assessment
application.
<P>

(6)	The narrative bill of costs claimed $29,950 as profit costs and $24,242.32
as disbursements - the total of the bill is $54,192.32
(as stated above).
<P>

(7)	On 13 March 1998, the plaintiff provided the defendant and the costs
assessor with an itemised solicitor/client bill of costs
which claimed profit
costs of $66,715.82 and disbursements in the sum of $21,269.03.  The itemised
bill of costs totals $87,984.85.
 
<P>

(8)	In April or May 1998, the defendant served an objection to the itemised
bill of costs.  He conceded the sum of $18,088.05 leaving
$48,627.77 in issue
for profit costs.  He also conceded the amount of $8,167.64 for disbursements
leaving in issue the sum of $13,101.39.
 Overall the defendant had conceded
$26,255.69 and left the sum of $61,729.16 in dispute.
<P>

(9)	On 15 June 1998, the plaintiff responded to the defendant's objections by
way of reply.  The net result of this left the sum
of $46,207.87 of profit
costs in dispute.  No further disbursements were conceded and the sum of
$13,101.39 was left in dispute.
 In total there was an amount of $59,309.26 in
dispute.
<P>

(10)	The costs assessor did not request or inspect the solicitor's file in
relation to the defendant's personal injury case held
by the solicitor.
<P>

(11)	On 4 August 1998, the costs assessor issued a certificate of
determination.  He allowed profit costs in the sum of $29,950
and disbursements
in the sum of $21,650.32.  He allowed a total of $51,600.32.  In his reasons
the costs assessor relevantly stated:
<P>

<b> "...I have assessed all of the legal services described by you in your
detailed bill of costs as having been provided after 1 July
1994 ie all of
those services commencing with item 376 and following at the basic rate of
$140.00 per hour for a solicitor.  You
will appreciate that it was necessary
for me to recalculate the costs of a considerable number of items to reflect
the new charge.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>I then applied an uplift of 25% for care, skill and consideration to the net
amount thus arrived at by me for the costs after 1 July
1994 to reach what I
believed was a fair and reasonable amount of costs to which you were then
entitled.  The end result of that
exercise was that I found that the sum of
$29,950.00 charged by you as profit costs in your lump sum narrative bill of
costs dated
31 October 1996 addressed to the costs applicant was a fair and
reasonable amount of costs to charge the applicant.</b>
<P>

<b>As to the disbursements charged in the detailed bill of costs, I have
reduced the fees of $3,750.00 charged by Mr Richard Royce of
Counsel for 8 July
1996 to $1,750.00.  The additional $2,000.00 charged by him for "say two days
on a refresher basis" is not acceptable
in the absence of the applicant's
considered consent to pay that amount or counsel having an entitlement pursuant
to the specific
terms of a costs agreement existing between you and him or
between the client and him to make such charge.  Furthermore I have not
allowed
you the loosely calculated and unsubstantiated amount of $595.00 referred to in
item 1178 of the bill.</b>
<P>

<b>The end result is that I have reduced the amount claimed for disbursements
in your bill of 31 October 1996 and statement of account
of the same date from
$24,245.32 to $21,650.32."</b>
<P>

34  	The costs assessor deducted the solicitor's charge for preparing
the legal practitioner/client bill of costs.  The plaintiff
did not submit that
this was an error.  In any event, it is my view that the costs assessor was
correct in deducting this amount.
<P>

35  	In <b><u>Florence Investments Pty Limited v H G Slater &amp;
Co</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%202%20NSWLR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 2 NSWLR 398</a> Bowen CJ stated that upon taxation of the
detailed bill regard may and, indeed, should, be paid to the earlier gross bill
as one
of the circumstances in the case.  It does not appear to his Honour to
be sensible or practicable to exclude it from the consideration
of the taxing
officer.  He further stated that his view was consistent with the decision of
the Full Court in <b><u>Re MacNamara's Costs</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLawRp/1884/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1884] NSWLawRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%205%20LR%20%28NSW%29%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 5 LR (NSW) 342</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WN%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1
WN 23</a> and with the history of the provisions.  However, Bowen CJ considered
this point was not of much importance because the obligation
of the taxing
officer in taxing a detailed bill will be to consider each item and the
circumstances which it applies to.  He concluded
that it is difficult to see
that it will be of much assistance to him in discharging that task to know that
an earlier gross sum
bill was delivered for an amount smaller than the total of
the detailed items in the bill before him.  At most it would seem it might
lead
him to scrutinise the detailed bill with especial care. This decision was given
when the taxation regime was in place and the
assessment procedures are
somewhat different.
<P>

36  	In <b><u>Bowen &amp; Ors v Campbell &amp; Anor</u></b> (NSWSC,
Master Malpass, unreported 2 December 1997) there was an earlier statement of
account and a bill covering at least some of
the same work.  The statement of
account was dated December 1996 for the sum of $274.89.  The bill of costs was
dated 17 January
1997 and rendered in the sum of $1,971.40.  The plaintiff in
<b><u>Bowen</u></b> submitted that the costs assessor had erred in law in
misconceiving his statutory function and duty in proceedings to determine a
bill of costs other than the bill of costs that was the subject of the
application for assessment.  Master Malpass referred to a
letter of
confirmation of the fairness and reasonableness of the earlier bill.  The
learned Master found that in these circumstances
the court has little
alternative but to find that there has been a relevant error of law and he was
not able to affirm the costs
assessor's decision.  The matter was remitted to
the costs assessor for re-determination.
<P>

37  	In the case before me the costs assessor had written to the
defendant prior to the receipt of the itemised bill, and stated
that he noted
the total costs and disbursements amount to $54,192.32.  He also noted that the
defendant disputed $25,000 but was
unaware which parts of the bill the
defendant disagreed with.  He said that he would need to carefully consider the
whole of the
solicitor's costs and disbursements to come to a decision as to
whether the defendant had been overcharged.  The costs assessor then
went on to
express an opinion that after cursorily considering the lump sum bill the sum
of $54,192 is more than fair and reasonable.
 In the costs assessor's reasons
he referred to the detailed bill of costs which I infer means the later
itemised bill of costs.
 The costs assessor says that work done by the
solicitor after 1 July 1994 was reduced to $140 per hour and he then applied an
uplift
of 25% for care, skill and consideration.  After performing this task he
found that the sum of $29,950 charged by the solicitors
in the narrative bill
was a fair and reasonable amount of costs to charge the applicant.  The costs
assessor then gave reasons for
reducing some disbursements.
<P>

38  	This raises the question did the costs assessor scrutinise the
itemised bill with special care or was his assessment clouded
by the earlier
narrative bill of costs?  It is difficult to say but it is my view, that the
amount claimed in the earlier narrative
bill of costs was unduly taken into
account by the costs assessor.  He gave advice to the defendant that the amount
of $54,192 was
fair and reasonable.  The total of the solicitor's costs in that
bill was $29,950.  The costs assessor found after assessing the
itemised bill
and after making some deductions he arrived at the sum of $29,950 the same
amount as claimed for solicitor's costs
as in the narrative bill of costs.
Accordingly, the appeal should be upheld and the certificate of the costs
assessor dated 4 August
1998 should be set aside.  
<P>

39  	In relation to the alternative submissions, the plaintiff did
not establish that the costs assessor had made an arithmetical
error.  This
submission fails.  The amount of the bill was $87,984.85.  An amount of
$59,309.26 was in dispute before the costs assessor.
 The costs assessor
allowed a total of $51,600.32 costs on assessment.  So in all, the bill of
costs was reduced by $36,386.43 which
is just under half of the amount claimed
in the bill of costs rendered.  I do not conclude that there has been an
obvious manifest
error because of the large reduction in costs. This
submission also fails.
<P>

40  	The defendant submitted that Ms Muc failed to comply with the
order of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to produce the
relevant receipts
and diaries in the matter and provided no reasons or explanations for her
failure.  However, these documents were
not before the costs assessor.  The
defendant also raised the doctrine of privity of contract.  Again, this was not
a matter that
was raised before the costs assessor.  The defendant submitted
that the affidavit sworn on 1 September 1998 by Ms Muc and attached
to the
summons was misleading and false and that the defendant was "tricked" into
signing the authority.  There was no evidence from
the defendant at all.  In
any event, this issue does not appear to be one that was ventilated before the
costs assessor.  As these
grounds of appeal were not matters raised before the
costs assessor they cannot be sustained.  Costs should follow the event.  The
defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

41  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The name of the defendant in the application for costs assessment be
amended to "Katarina Muc".
<P>

(2)	The name of the plaintiff in the summons be amended to "Katarina Muc".
<P>

(3)	The appeal is upheld.  The certificate of the costs assessor dated 4 August
1998 is set aside.
<P>

(4)	The matter is to be remitted to the costs assessor for re-determination.
<P>

(5)	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
