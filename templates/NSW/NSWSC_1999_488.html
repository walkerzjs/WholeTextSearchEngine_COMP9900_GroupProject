<b>1452/98  -  MARK GONSALVES &amp; ANOR  v  PETER DEBRECZENI &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (delivered orally on 24 May 1999;  revised 25 May 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by the plaintiffs, by notice
of motion, to extend the operation of their caveat over land
at Lot 1, Hector
Street, Illawong.  The defendants are the purchasers of the land and the caveat
prevents them from becoming the
registered proprietors.  
<P>

2  	The application has been made in proceedings determined by the
judgment of Young J, delivered on 4 December 1998.  His Honour
found that the
plaintiffs engaged a real estate agency, Clover Enterprises Pty Ltd, trading as
`Clover Real Estate: The Professionals',
to sell their property at 61 Old Ferry
Road, Illawong.  The first defendant was the employee of the real estate agency
with whom
the plaintiffs most frequently dealt.  The second defendant is the
first defendant's wife.
<P>

3  	During the course of the plaintiff's dealings with the real
estate agency with respect to sale of the property at Old Ferry
Road, the first
defendant showed the plaintiffs other properties in order to interest them in
buying.  The plaintiffs indicated their
strong preference for the Hector Street
land.  The first defendant eventually became aware that the plaintiffs had
negotiated with
the owner, Mr John Young, to buy the land at Hector Street for
a purchase price in the range of $415,000 to $420,000 and had received
a draft
contract from the vendor's solicitor.  The defendants offered an additional
$10,000 to the vendor and exchanged contracts
minutes before the appointed time
for the vendor to exchange contracts with the plaintiffs.
<P>

4  	These findings of fact implied a gross violation by the first
defendant of a basic principle of commercial morality.  However,
the questions
for Young J were, as always, legal questions rather than questions purely about
morality.  He had to decide whether
the first defendant owed a legal duty to
the plaintiffs, whether any such duty had been breached, and if so, whether the
plaintiffs
were entitled to a remedy against both defendants which would enable
them to obtain the Hector Street land or damages for its loss.
<P>

5  	Young J found that the first defendant, though an employee, was
in a fiduciary relationship with the defendants in relation
to the sale of
their property at Old Ferry Road.  But the obligations which flowed from that
relationship did not, on the facts,
carry over into their respective roles as
selling agent and intending purchasers.
<P>

6  	It was also contended that the first defendant was accountable to
the plaintiffs because he had wrongly used his position (the
position of
fiduciary agent for sale of the property at Old Ferry Road) to acquire for
himself and his wife the benefit of acquiring
the Hector Street land.  Young J
rejected this contention.  He held that the acquisition of the Hector Street
land was capable of
being regarded as the kind of benefit for which a fiduciary
is accountable, even though full value was paid; but he also held, in
effect,
the benefit obtained by the defendants' purchase of the Hector Street land was
outside the scope of the first defendant's
fiduciary duty as agent for the sale
of the property at Old Ferry Road.
<P>

7  	Young J also held that the information passed on to the first
defendant about the intended purchase was not confidential information
of a
kind warranting equitable protection.  He rejected, on the facts, a submission
that the first defendant had engaged in misleading
or deceptive conduct in
breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW).
<P>

8  	Although those findings were sufficient to dispose of the case in
favour of the defendants, his Honour also made some observations
on the
question of remedies.  The plaintiffs had contended for a constructive trust of
the Hector Street land in their favour, subject
to their paying the necessary
expenses incurred by the defendants in purchasing the land.  Young J indicated
that he did not consider
the case to be an appropriate one for granting a
remedy by way of constructive trust.  He was concerned that to do so would have
put the plaintiffs in a far better position than if they had lost the land to a
disinterested third party.  There was no suggestion,
he noted, that the
property was bought at an undervalue, or that any information derived from the
plaintiffs went further than to
show the first defendant the lower limit of
where he should pitch his bid.  His Honour would have preferred a remedy by way
of damages,
perhaps on an equitable rather than a common law measure.
<P>

9  	The plaintiffs have appealed from Young J's judgment.  The
grounds of appeal challenge his Honour's findings as to the first
defendant's
duty as a fiduciary not to misuse his position;  the confidentiality of the
information disclosed to the first defendant;
 and the question whether the
first defendant's conduct was misleading or deceptive.  The plaintiffs seek to
set aside Young J's
orders and replace them with orders recognising a
constructive trust and ordering that the Hector Street land be transferred to
them
upon their indemnifying the defendants for purchase money, and perhaps
also the costs and expenses of acquisition.  The appeal has
not yet been
heard.
<P>

10  	On 24 February 1998, shortly after discovering that they had
been `gazumped' by the defendants, the plaintiffs lodged a caveat
against the
Hector Street land, of which the registered proprietor was then and still is
the vendor, John Young.  The caveat asserted
that the plaintiffs were
beneficially entitled to the defendants' interest as purchaser from John Young.
The plaintiffs received
a notice from the Land Titles Office on 9 April 1999
issued under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74j.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74J</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act, 1900</a> (NSW) on the application of
John Young.  The notice stated that the caveat would lapse upon the expiration
of twenty-one days unless
this Court were to order an extension and the order
were to be lodged within that period.
<P>

11  	The plaintiffs' solicitor then wrote to the defendants'
solicitor indicating that the plaintiffs did not object to the land
being
transferred to the defendants, provided the plaintiffs' interest was protected
by a further caveat lodged upon registration
of the defendants as registered
proprietors.  The plaintiffs' solicitors sought an undertaking by the
defendants' solicitors to advise
them when the transfer was being lodged for
registration, so that the plaintiffs could lodge their further caveat
simultaneously.
 When that undertaking was refused, the plaintiffs brought the
present application.  They seek an order that the operation of the
existing
caveat be extended until final determination of their appeal, or until further
order of the Court of Appeal or this Court.
<P>

12  	In support of the application Mrs Gonsalves has given evidence,
which I accept, that the Hector Street land has extensive views
over the
Woronora River; that as far as she is aware there is no comparable block of
land on the Illawong peninsula; that the plaintiffs
wish to build a family home
on the land and live there indefinitely, since other members of their immediate
family also live in Illawong;
and that the plaintiffs have instructed their
solicitor to prosecute the appeal with all proper diligence.
<P>

13  	The Court's power to extend the operation of a caveat which
would otherwise lapse under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74j.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74J</a> is conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K</a> which states:
<P>

`(1)	Where a caveator is served with a notice prepared under section 741(1) or
(2) or 741J(1), the caveator may prepare, in the
manner prescribed by rules of
Court, an application to the Supreme Court for an order extending the operation
of the caveat.
<P>

(2)	Subject to subsection (3), on the hearing of an application made under
subsection (1), the Supreme Court may, if satisfied that
the caveator's claim
has or may have substance, make an order extending the operation of the caveat
concerned for such period as
is specified in the order or until the further
order of that Court, or may make such other orders as it thinks fit, but, if
that
Court is not so satisfied, it shall dismiss the application.
<P>

(3)	Unless the Supreme Court has made an order dispensing with service, it may
not hear an application made under subsection (1)
unless it is satisfied that
all interested parties disclosed by the notice which gave rise to the
application have been served with
copies of the application before the
hearing.
<P>

(4)	An order under subsection (2) may be made ex parte or otherwise.
<P>

(5)	When making an order under subsection (2), the Supreme Court may make such
ancillary orders as it thinks fit.'
<P>

14  	In the present case it appears the plaintiffs have complied with
subs (1).  Subsection (3) is a problem because John Young,
the registered
proprietor, is not a party to the application.  As registered proprietor he is
undoubtedly an `interested party' since
the caveat prevents the registration of
dealings with respect to the land - indeed, he is the only party identified by
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74j.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74J</a> notice apart from the plaintiffs, and appears to have made the
application which caused the Director of the Land Titles Office to
issue the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74j.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
74J</a> notice.
<P>

15  	At the commencement of the hearing before me, counsel for the
defendants took the point that there was no proof that John Young
had been
served with the plaintiffs' application, and submitted that there was no basis
for the Court to make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K(3)</a> dispensing with service.  Counsel
for the plaintiffs responded that it would be manifestly unjust to deny relief
to the plaintiffs
on the formal ground of want of parties if they otherwise had
a meritorious case.  He said that John Young no longer had any real
interest,
although there was no evidence of this.  He invited me to stand the matter down
in the list for hearing later in the day
so that in the meantime John Young
could be served.  However, it seemed to me doubtful that John Young could be
located in sufficient
time and, even if he were, he would have inadequate time
to obtain legal advice, and so service would be futile unless the case were
to
be adjourned at cost to the real disputants.
<P>

16  	I decided that the appropriate course was to make an immediate
order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K(3)</a> dispensing with service, so as to overcome <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K(3)</a> and
empower myself to hear the application.  I gave brief ex tempore reasons for
making the order, in which I warned the parties
that I might find it necessary
to vacate the order if it became apparent that John Young had a continuing real
interest and therefore
should be served with the application.  I shall return
to the position of John Young later in these reasons.
<P>

17  	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K(2)</a> the question is whether the Court is `satisfied
that the caveators' claim has or may have substance.'  If I am not so satisfied
I
must dismiss the application.  It appears that in considering the statutory
question the courts in this State and in other jurisdictions
which have adopted
the Torrens system apply the same principles as they would apply if the
caveators were seeking an interlocutory
injunction to restrain interference
with their asserted interest pending a final hearing of their claim.  Thus, the
Court should
consider whether there is a serious question to be tried (or an
`arguable case') and whether the balance of convenience favours the
extension.
Young J took this approach in <i>Penny Nominees Pty Ltd v Fountain</i>
(unreported, 2 May 1989), though he pointed out that if the claim depends
solely on a question of law, the Court will normally decide
that question.
Cases in other comparable jurisdictions have applied the interlocutory
injunction standard both on applications for
extension of the operation of
caveats, and on applications for removal of caveats (where the legislation
provides for such applications):
see S Colbran and S Jackson, <i>Caveats</i>
(1996) pp 428 ff (especially at 434), and 332 ff.
<P>

18  	It appears to me that in New South Wales the statutory wording
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K(2)</a> lends support to this approach, for the words `has or may have
substance' point to the `serious question' criterion; and the Court
is
empowered but not directed to make an order if it is satisfied to the requisite
standard, suggesting a judicial discretion to
which considerations of balance
of convenience would be relevant.
<P>

19  	In the present case the application of the `serious question to
be tried' test would require the Court to assess the prospects
of successful
appeal from a judgment and orders made by this Court.  The plaintiffs say I
should not hesitate to do so; that their
appeal is clearly not vexatious or
frivolous; and that it therefore satisfies the `serious question' test as
enunciated by the House
of Lords in <i>American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1975/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 396.</a>  They point to cases where an order was made
extending a caveat to cater for an appeal: <i>Mawbey v Jannine Pty Ltd (No
2)</i> (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Appeal, 24 May
1990); <i>Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20NZLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 NZLR 394.</a>
However, these cases were cases where the order against which an appeal was
made was an order refusing to extend the operation of
the caveat.  One can
understand a short-term order being made in such a case, just as the Court may
extend for a short time an injunction
which it decides to dissolve, to preserve
the status quo pending an appeal, analogously to granting a stay.  In this
case, however,
the judgment from which an appeal has been made is a judgment
dealing with the plaintiffs' claim to a proprietary interest against
the
defendants, and the decision contrary to the plaintiffs has undermined the
basis on which they as caveators claim an interest
in the land.
<P>

20  	In <i>Van Reesema v Giameous (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2017%20SASR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 17 SASR 39</a> the
Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia refused to extend the
operation of a caveat pending the resolution of the
caveator's appeal to the
Privy Council, but did so on the narrow basis that it lacked jurisdiction on
the particular wording of the
statutory provisions which were before it.  In
<i>Howe v Waimiha Timber Co Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1921%5d%20NZLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1921] NZLR 110</a>, 114 it was held that a
caveat ought not to be extended pending an appeal to the Privy Council on the
ground that to allow the caveat
to remain would be to deny the registered
proprietor the fruits of the judgments that he had obtained.  It is not clear
whether this
decision was merely the result of the balancing of discretionary
considerations on the facts of the case, or asserted a more absolute
principle.
<P>

21  	Counsel for the defendants says there is indeed an absolute
principle at work, namely, the law of estoppel and res judicata.
 His forceful
submission is that the plaintiffs are now estopped by Young J's judgment and
orders from asserting the claim made in
the caveat, and therefore there can be
no proper basis for extending the operation of the caveat.  He relies on two
forms of estoppel
by record, namely, cause of action estoppel and issue
estoppel.
<P>

22  	Cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel have some common
ingredients.  There must be a final binding judgment on the merits
by a
tribunal of competent jurisdiction, to which the parties are privy.  These
elements are clearly satisfied as regards the plaintiffs
and the defendants by
Young J's judgment and orders, which cannot be varied, reopened, or set aside
by a Court of coordinate jurisdiction:
<i>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner &amp;
Keeler Limited (No 3)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20Ch%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] Ch 506</a>, 538-9; <i>Linprint Pty Ltd v Hexam
Textiles Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 508</a>, 517 to 521, 526.
<P>

23  	The requirement that the judgment be final is not diminished
because it is appealable (<i>Marchioness of Huntley v Gaskell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%202%20Ch%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] 2 Ch
656</a>, 667; <i>Taylor v Ansett Transport Industries Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2018%20FCR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 18 FCR
342</a>, 354, 365; <i>Rogers v The Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 251</a>, 279; Spencer Bower
Turner &amp; Handley, <i>The Doctrine of Res Judicata</i> (1996) p 382); nor
because an appeal has been lodged (<i>Harris v Willis</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1855/118.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1855] EngR 118</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281855%29%2015%20CB%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1855) 15 CB 710</a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ER%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[139
ER 604]).</a>
<P>

24  	Additionally, cause of action estoppel applies only where the
same cause of action is asserted, and this occurs if a party
asserts that the
same right has been infringed or seeks in substance to have the same
controversy decided: <i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981)
147 CLR 589</a>, 610-11; <i>Onerati v Phillips Constructions Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20730" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16
NSWLR 730</a>, 737-49; <i>Trawl v Effem Foods</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/272.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 272</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20108%20ALR%20335" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 108 ALR 335.</a>  Counsel for
the defendants submits that the plaintiffs' claim in the caveat is in substance
the same as the claim rejected in Young
J's judgment.  Accordingly, cause of
action estoppel applies.
<P>

25  	Issue estoppel applies, in the circumstances already described,
if a question of fact or law has been directly put in issue
in the previous
proceedings and has been solemnly pronounced upon with certainty: see
<i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> (4th Ed) para 965.  Counsel for the
defendants says that these elements were satisfied by the hearing and judgment
of Young J which
made findings which are fatal to the claim made in the
caveat.
<P>

26  	In my opinion, Young J's judgment and orders create estoppels
with respect to the issues or causes of action specifically dealt
with by Young
J, namely: that the first defendant did not owe the plaintiffs any fiduciary
duty; that the first defendant did not
misuse his position to gain a benefit
for which he must account; that the first defendant did not receive or misuse
any confidential
information of the plaintiffs; and that the defendants did not
breach <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>.
<P>

27  	The defendants also allege that there was an estoppel with
respect to Young J's finding that a constructive trust would be
not an
appropriate remedy had he found a breach of duty.  I disagree.  In my opinion
the remarks on this point were obiter dicta,
as the point did not arise in the
light of his conclusion that there was no breach of duty, and were expressed in
a qualified way,
using language such as `I was very troubled' and `I am not at
all sure'.  However, in my view nothing turns on this finding because
there is
an estoppel in respect of each allegation of breach of duty which is said to
lead to proprietary relief.
<P>

28  	Since estoppel arises to the extent which I have indicated, it
seems to me that the plaintiffs can no longer assert against
the defendants the
claim which they make in the caveat.  Whilst they were not by any judgment
estopped from making the claim in February
1998, when the caveat was first
lodged, they became estopped from continuing with that claim against the
defendants when Young J's
judgment was delivered and his orders were made.
Although it is generally true (as Young J observed in the <i>Penny Nominees</i>
case) that for the purposes of s 74K the `caveators' claim' is the claim made
in the caveat, the Court's task under the section is
to be satisfied that at
the time of hearing the application, rather than historically, the `caveators'
claim' has or may have substance.
<P>

29  	An estoppel arising after lodgement of the caveat which prevents
the caveators from subsequently asserting their claim requires
the Court to
refuse the extension, to the extent that the claim is asserted against a person
who has the benefit of the estoppel.
 The defendants can rely on the estoppel,
and the registered proprietor does not need to do so, as the caveat does not
assert any
interest other than a beneficial entitlement to the defendants'
interest in the land.  Nor, in my opinion, could the plaintiffs avoid
the
estoppel by re-drafting their claim to make it contingent on their success in
the Court of Appeal, because a caveat so drafted
would either assert a present
interest contrary to the estoppel, or it would not assert an interest capable
of supporting a caveat.
<P>

30  	Since formulating these reasons, I have been very pleased to
discover that they conform to the judgment of McLelland CJ in
Eq in <i>Lahoud v
B &amp; M Quality Constructions Pty Ltd</i> (unreported, 22 July 1994).  There
the facts were very similar to the present case, except that the caveat was
lodged after the Court
had found against the interest claimed in the caveat,
and the caveat claimed `a right as beneficial owner to require [the defendants]
to transfer land held by them in trust for the caveator, subject to the Court
of Appeal upholding an appeal by the caveator ...'.
 I do not regard these
factual distinctions as significant because in that case, as in the present
case, the Court was asked to make
a decision about extending the operation of
the caveat at a time when an appeal had been lodged against a judgment which
denied the
interest on which the caveat was based.
<P>

31  	McLelland CJ in Eq said:
<P>

`In the first place, the judgment and orders of Windeyer J of 20 October 1993
give rise to an estoppel, at least as between Mr Lahoud
and B &amp; M, on the
issue whether Mr Lahoud has any present interest as claimed in the property.
Unless and until Windeyer J's
orders are set aside, that estoppel remains
binding, and it is immaterial that an appeal is pending from those orders (see
Spencer-Bower
&amp;  Turner `Res Judicata' 2 ed p 144, cases cited in footnote
5 and corresponding text).  Elmowy would, in my opinion, also be
entitled to
the benefit of that estoppel as a successor in title to B &amp; M.'
<P>

32  	My conclusion that the plaintiffs are estopped from asserting
against the defendants matters upon which they must rely to support
their
caveat, prevents me from concluding that there is a serious question to be
tried, and hence from being satisfied for the purposes
of s 74K(2) that the
plaintiffs' claim as caveators has or may have substance.  It follows that the
plaintiffs' application for extension
of the operation of the caveat must
fail.
<P>

33  	Even if I had reached a different conclusion on those matters, I
doubt that I would have made the order for extension, having
regard to the
balance of convenience.  First, my opinion is that the orders should not be
made without at least giving John Young,
the registered proprietor, the
opportunity to be heard.  The present caveat prevents him from dealing with his
land and, in my opinion,
no proper justification for doing so has been
advanced.  However, even if there were some way of permitting registration of
the transfer
to the defendants and then allowing lodgement of a fresh caveat to
restrain dealings by them (perhaps by my making an order under
s 74O) I would
be inclined to favour the defendants over the plaintiffs on the question of the
balance of convenience.
<P>

34  	Whilst I acknowledge the special value of the Hector Street land
to the plaintiffs, I am not satisfied that this would justify
orders which
could extend the life of the caveat for a very considerable time, preventing
the defendants from dealing with the land
whatever may be their financial
situation from time to time unless they successfully apply to the Court of
Appeal or this Court.
 Interest and other expenses and losses could be
substantial, and I would hesitate to expose the defendants to that risk even if
I were to require the plaintiffs to give an undertaking to pay damages in the
usual form.  Moreover, extension of the operation of
the caveat would not fully
protect the plaintiffs' position since the defendants would not thereby be
prevented from improving the
property by, for example, building on it.  (I say
nothing about the legal risks to which that course of action may give rise,
whether
there is a caveat or not, given the defendants' knowledge of the
plaintiffs' claim.)
<P>

35  	In this case it seems to me that the plaintiffs are seeking to
use the caveat to preserve their position pending the hearing
of the appeal.
They may have directly applied for interlocutory orders for that purpose but,
as far as I am aware, they have not
done so.  In my opinion, the latter would
have been a more appropriate application.
<P>

36  	In my opinion the plaintiffs' motion should be denied.
<P>

37  	(Question of costs stood over to another time)
