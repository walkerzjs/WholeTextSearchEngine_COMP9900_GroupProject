<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	<b>GILES J:</b>  Some matters were outstanding following
publication of my reasons of 13 May 1999.  In what follows I assume knowledge
of the earlier
reasons, and use the acronyms and abbreviations there used. 
<P>

2   	There were five matters, namely -
<P>

(a)	Interest;
<P>

(b)	Costs;
<P>

(c)	AT's cross-claim against directors;
<P>

(d)	AAH's cross-claim against directors;  and
<P>

(e)	AT's further cross-claim against Mr Heydon.
<P>

<b>(a )  Interest</b>
<P>

3   	I found that each of AAH, AT and Mr Heydon was liable in
damages to the NRMA for $21,193,828 plus interest.  Interest had to
be
calculated.  The interest was interest to be included in the sum for which
judgment is given pursuant to s 94 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a>.
<P>

4   	The NRMA claimed interest calculated to 3 June 1999 at
$10,539,412 and continuing at $5,414.04 per day.  The defendants agreed
with
the calculation as a calculation, but raised three issues.  
<P>

5   	First, AAH submitted that interest should not run between
10 June 1997 and 25 May 1998.  If that were so, the corresponding
figures were
agreed as a calculation at $8,472,615 and $5,414.04.  Secondly, AT submitted
that there should be additional interest
on a component of the damages.  If
that were so, the corresponding figures were agreed as a calculation at
$10,655,461 and $5,544.14.
 Thirdly, Mr Heydon submitted that interest should
not run for the last eleven months to judgment.  If that were so, the
corresponding
figures (treating 13 May 1999 as judgment) were agreed as a
calculation at $8,658,781 and $5,414.04.  The effect of the second issue
could
be cumulative on the effect of the first or third issues, but the first and
third issues were alternatives.  It was not suggested
that judgment after 13
May 1999 would affect the calculation for the third issue.  
<P>

6   	The first and third issues were different manifestations of
the same argument, that the NRMA should not have interest referable
to what was
said to be a period of delay occasioned by its late joinder of Mr Heydon as a
defendant.  
<P>

7   	The NRMA brought the proceedings in late 1995.  It joined
only AAH and AT as defendants.  On 11 September 1996 the proceedings
were fixed
for hearing to commence on 9 June 1997.  On 15 May 1997 that hearing was
vacated, amongst other reasons because the NRMA
said that it was considering
joining Mr Heydon as a defendant.  The NRMA decided to join Mr Heydon as a
defendant, and leave to join
him was given on 20 June 1997.  On 25 July 1997
the proceedings were fixed for hearing to commence on 2 February 1998.  On 7
August
1997 that hearing was vacated and the proceedings were fixed for hearing
to commence on 25 May 1998, the change being for reasons
of counsels'
availability.  
<P>

8   	There were, of course, directions hearings with a view to
the preparation of the proceedings for hearing, initially for the
hearing to
commence on 9 June 1997 and then, with the additional involvement of Mr Heydon,
for the hearing to commence on 25 May
1998.  AAH and AT did not comply with the
directions given for service of witness statements prior to the hearing to
commence on
9 June 1997.  They served substantial witness statements of Messrs
Morgan, Simpson and Bateman and Mrs Castle at the end of April
1997.  One of
the NRMA's contentions on 15 May 1997 was that, because of the need to
interview potential witnesses and respond to
the witness statements, there was
insufficient time for the NRMA properly to prepare its case for the hearing.

<P>

9   	The witness statements included proposed evidence from
Messrs Morgan, Bateman, Simpson and Mrs Castle of communications with
Mr Heydon
in relation to describing the shares as free shares and the significance of
<i>Gambotto's case</i> to the proposal.  The other of the NRMA's contentions on
15 May 1997 was to the effect that it had not until then been in a position
responsibly to join Mr Heydon as a defendant, that it was communicating with Mr
Heydon's solicitors with a view to Mr Heydon providing
a statement, and that
subject to what might come from that communication it thought it could then
properly make the allegations in
due course made against Mr Heydon.  
<P>

10   	For these reasons the NRMA proposed on 15 May 1997 that
the hearing to commence on 9 June 1997 be vacated.  It is possible
that, with a
late start some time at the end of June 1997, the hearing could have been
retained notwithstanding the difficulty in
which the NRMA had been put by the
defaults of AAH and AT.  But it had been put in a difficult position, and was
likely to suffer
prejudice.  Mr Heydon submitted before me that the NRMA had
been in possession of sufficient information, via particulars and discovered
documents, to enable it to decide whether or not to join him no later than
August or September 1996, but I consider that the direct
(proposed) evidence of
Messrs Morgan, Simpson and Bateman and Mrs Castle was an important matter in
deciding whether or not to make
the allegations in due course made against Mr
Heydon.  
<P>

11   	I was the judge principally involved in the directions
hearings, and the judge who vacated the hearing to commence on 9 June
1997.
The looming prejudice to the NRMA and the need to have settled the position of
Mr Heydon in my view gave good grounds for vacating
the hearing, and I do not
think that the loss of the hearing to commence on 7 June 1997 was due to
default, delay, or unreasonable
attention to the proceedings or its claims on
the part of the NRMA.  The occasion for changing the refixed hearing from 2
February
1998 to 25 May 1998 was certainly no fault of the NRMA, but rather
against its wishes.
<P>

12   	Interest is awarded in the exercise of the discretionary
power in s 94 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>.  The power is to be exercised in
order to provide compensation, not to punish, and on the basis that the
defendant has had the benefit
of not paying the capital sum and the plaintiff
has had the detriment of not having it:  <i>Bennett v Jones</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2 NSWLR
355</a> at 367-70.  Delay occasioned by a plaintiff, while relevant, does not mean
no interest during the period of delay, and some particular
economic
disadvantage occasioned by the delay and material to the exercise of the
discretion must be shown;  <i>ibid</i>;  <i>Perri v Flavell (No 2)</i> (NSWCA,
20 September 1995, unreported).  
<P>

13   	In the present case there was no evidence of particular
economic disadvantage, and none was suggested in submissions.  AAH
and Mr
Heydon relied only on asserted delay by the NRMA (AT did not take up either of
these issues).
<P>

14   	If there were to be an exercise of the discretion by
excluding a period from the time for which interest is to run, in principle
the
exclusion should be of the last eleven months to judgment.  The proper
manifestation of the argument was as the third issue,
rather than the first
issue, on the basis that, but for the asserted delay, judgment would have been
given eleven months earlier.
 But I do not think that there should be any break
in the running of interest.  
<P>

15   	Even assuming in favour of AAH and Mr Heydon that the NRMA
acted unreasonably in failing initially to join Mr Heydon as a
defendant, that
is, that the NRMA had information warranting his joinder from a time in the
latter part of 1996 and could and should
have joined him then, I do not think
that the proper exercise of the discretion calls for such a result.  But I do
not think that
the NRMA acted unreasonably in that respect, and in any event
the hearing to commence on 9 June 1997 was compromised by the defaults
of AAH
and AT.  On the principles earlier stated, and in the circumstances in which
the vacation of the hearing came about and the
eleven months "delay" occurred,
I do not think sufficient reason has been shown to decline to award interest
for the period in question
or any part of it.
<P>

16   	The second issue was rather curious.  The NRMA had not
paid some of AT's fees for its legal services in connection with the
proposed
demutualisation.  Its claim included the amount in question, $256,392, and so
it recognised a liability to AT.  AT argued
that when it was paid the $256,392
it was entitled to receive interest of $116,049 on that sum, apparently as some
equivalent to
s 94 interest and not as a contractual entitlement.  So, AT said,
the NRMA's damages should include additional interest of $116,049.
<P>

17   	Interest of $116,049 payable to AT would not be s 94
interest to be included in the sum for which judgment is given.  If to
be
included in that sum, it would be as a capital item in the damages.  The NRMA
did not claim it.  There was no cross-claim by AT
to recover the $256,392.
Payment of the $256,392 by the NRMA to AT is not part of these proceedings, and
the additional interest
of $116,049 should not be awarded.
<P>

18   	The interest calculated to the date of these reasons is
$10,875,082, and the sum for which judgment should be given including
that
interest is $32,068,910.
<P>

<b>(b)  Costs</b>
<P>

19   	The NRMA submitted that it had succeeded in the
proceedings and should have an unqualified order that the defendants pay its
costs.  The defendants' submissions were predictably otherwise, and varied.  It
was common ground that any order for costs should
be a global order, not
distinguishing between claims and cross-claims and, if less than an unqualified
order in favour of the NRMA,
not requiring a taxing officer to attribute costs
to issues or some other differentiating factor stated in the order.
<P>

20   	AAH submitted that the order as to costs should reflect
that the NRMA had failed in relation to free shares/disadvantages
and some
discrete matters of damages (internal service providers' costs and distribution
of the Grant Samuel report);  reflect that
Gambotto liability was only brought
into the proceedings by amendment in March 1996;  and include orders in favour
of AAH for the
costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the hearing date
of 10 June 1997 and of a directions hearing on 6 June 1997 adjourned
because
the NRMA was still deciding whether to join Mr Heydon as a defendant.  In the
result, AAH said that there should be no order
as to costs, as I understand it
in the end on the basis that any separate order for costs in its favour would
be unnecessary.
<P>

21   	AT submitted that the order as to costs should reflect
that the NRMA had failed in relation to free shares/disadvantages and
"all
issues which were abandoned", or alternatively, that the NRMA should have its
costs only on Gambotto liability.  It was more
adventurous than AAH, saying
that the NRMA should pay one third of the defendants' costs, but with fall-back
positions to no order
as to costs or at worst that the defendants should pay
one third of the NRMA's costs.
<P>

22   	Mr Heydon submitted that the order as to costs should
reflect that the NRMA had failed in relation to free shares/disadvantages;
that Gambotto liability was only brought into the proceedings by amendment in
March 1996;  that he was not joined in the proceedings
until June 1997;  that a
number of claims or bases of claim against him were abandoned at a late stage
and the case against him was
narrowed as the hearing continued;  and that the
case against him on free shares/disadvantages "suffered from many fundamental
flaws".
 He said that the defendants should pay 40 per cent of the NRMA's costs
and the NRMA should pay 60 per cent of the defendants' costs,
or alternatively,
that there should be no order as to costs.
<P>

23   	By s 76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> costs are in the
discretion of the Court.  The discretion is a judicial discretion, to be
exercised on proper grounds and not at
whim.  The starting-point is prescribed
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52</a> r 11 of the Rules, that costs follow the event unless it "appears to
the court that some other order should be made as to the whole
or any part of
the costs".
<P>

24   	Principles according to which some other order may be made
are fairly well established.  If a party fails on some issues,
the
circumstances may make it reasonable that he be deprived of the costs of those
issues, or even be ordered to pay the other party's
costs of those issues.  For
this purpose, issues may be issues in a pleading sense of bases of claim, or
may be disputed questions
of fact or law.  But it must be remembered that
parties should not be dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues
which
might be material to the decision in the case, and unless a particular
issue or group of issues is clearly dominant or separable
from the balance of
the proceedings it will ordinarily be appropriate to award the costs of the
proceedings to the successful party
without attempting to differentiate between
the issues on which he was successful and those on which he failed.  It is

to refer to <i>Cretazzo v Lombardi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2013%20SASR%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 13 SASR 4</a> at 12;<i>

<P>

25   	If an order reflecting success or failure on issues is
made, it is appropriate to have regard to the time referable to the
issues,
although necessarily without mathematical precision (<i>Lenning v Alexander
Proudfood Company World Headquarters</i> (NSWCA, 22 April 1991, unreported)).
It is not necessary that the issue or issues on which the party failed was or
were raised by
him unreasonably (<i>Rosniak v Government Insurance Office</i>

<P>

26   	The major element in the defendants' submissions was the
NRMA's failure in relation to free shares/disadvantages liability.
 That
contest was largely discrete from the contest in relation to Gambotto
liability.  Although there was overlapping to an extent,
in particular because
some knowledge of the free shares question and the disadvantages question was
background to Gambotto liability
and because the defendants' case that the
majority directors were intent on demutualisation come what may  required
regard to all
the questions, a deal of the time in the hearing was devoted to
it.  Many documents, a number of witnesses, and the detailed examination
of the
drafting of the prospectus and the events of early August 1994 were to do with
the contest on which the NRMA failed.  In the
absence of other information, I
see no reason to conclude that the preparation for the hearing did not also
reflected the discrete
contest.  The NRMA's failure in relation to free
shares/disadvantages liability included what I held to be unavailable reliance
on
the notion of wasted expenditure, and was a failure on grounds for which the
NRMA did not have the encouragement of the decision
of the Full Court of the
Federal Court as well as on the ground on which it had that encouragement:  in
this last respect, what was
said in <i>Rozniak v Government Insurance
Office</i> is pertinent.  
<P>

27   	I was provided with some analyses of time spent on issues.
I do not think that the NRMA's failure in relation to free shares/disadvantages
liability calls for anything like the apportionments of costs suggested by the
defendants.  As an illustration only, but a significant
one, of much time spent
in relation to Gambotto liability a lot of time was spent in the defendants'
endeavour to establish the majority
directors' unyielding commitment to
demutualisation and determination to proceed notwithstanding the Gambotto
advice.  I am nonetheless
satisfied that, in doing justice between the parties,
there should be departure from the starting-point of costs following the event.

<P>

28   	Precision is impossible.  In my view, there will be
appropriate recognition that the NRMA was not wholly successful in the
proceedings if the defendants pay two thirds of its costs of the proceedings.
I do not think that any further allowance for some
undoubted narrowing of the
NRMA's case from its case as pleaded, both in the manner it was conducted and
in the abandonment of some
matters, should be made, they being part of the ebb
and flow of litigation such as these proceedings and matched by changes in the
stances of at least AAH and AT.  
<P>

29   	In this I allow for the other matters on which all the
defendants relied:  the period until March 1996 for which the NRMA
asserted
only free shares/disadvantages liability, and the NRMA's failure on some
aspects of damages (not particularly time-consuming
in the hearing, although
the out of court attention to agreement on figures must not be overlooked).  If
my understanding concerning
a separate order for costs in favour of AAH is
incorrect, I would in any event not make such an order.  AAH already has an
order
that the NRMA pay the costs thrown away by reason of the amendments to
the points of claim when Mr Heydon was joined as a defendant,
and I do not
think anything more should be done in that connection.
<P>

30   	Although the submissions all treated the defendants as in
the same position, I have considered whether Mr Heydon's position
is materially
different from that of AAH and AT.  He was joined late, but the NRMA's costs
prior to June 1997 must have been in general
for work taken up in the case
presented against him.  The case against him was initially a little narrower
than the case against
AAH and AT, and was narrowed  as the hearing continued,
but that was in relation to free shares/disadvantages liability which is
accommodated by the two thirds estimation.  This accommodation can not be
enlarged by describing the free shares/disadvantages case
against Mr Heydon as
fundamentally flawed.  I do not think that any different order as between the
NRMA and Mr Heydon is warranted.
<P>

31   	As between the defendants, the costs payable to the NRMA
should be borne in the same proportion as the judgment sum.  
<P>

<b>(c)  AT's cross-claim against directors</b>
<P>

32   	On 8 April 1998 AT filed a notice of motion seeking leave
to cross-claim against directors of the NRMA.  The directors were
all but a few
of the persons holding office in Association, Insurance and Holdings over the
period May-August 1994.  AT claimed contribution
pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the
LR Act, on the ground that the directors had breached their duties owed to the
NRMA under "the general
law" and ss 232(2) and 232(4) of the Law by failing to
disclose to AT, as the NRMA's solicitors involved in drafting the prospectus,
all the disadvantages of the proposal they perceived or ought reasonably to
have perceived.
<P>

33   	The application came before Hunter J on 22 April 1998.  It
had been made at a remarkably late stage in the proceedings, and
was opposed by
the other parties and by the directors because of the delay, the effect on the
hearing to commence a month later,
and (from the directors' point of view), the
weakness of the particularised case against them.  
<P>

34   	In the reasons he gave on that day his Honour said that
the only reason for the application was "a prudent avoidance by [AT]
of being
Anshun estopped in any separate proceedings brought against the directors";
that the lateness was because AT had not adverted
to the possibility of such
Anshun estoppel until a date in March 1998;  that it was not easy to see how AT
could be Anshun<i> </i>estopped in any separate proceedings brought against the
directors;  that there was little doubt that the directors could not prepare
to
meet the cross-claim for the hearing to commence on 25 May 1998;  that leave
should not be granted with the effect of aborting
the fixed date for hearing;
and that if leave were to be granted, it could only be on strict conditions
including an order for the
separate hearing of the proposed cross-claim.
Expressing the view that the application "can be looked at as simply a holding
one,
to keep the Anshun estoppel point at bay", his Honour adjourned the
hearing of the application until after reasons for judgment in
the proceedings
but prior to the entry of judgment.  He recorded that when he proposed that
course to the parties it "met with no
objection ... subject to the directors'
counsel making it clear that such a course was not the desired course".
<P>

35   	The references to Anshun estoppel were to the principle,
stemming from the statement by Wigram VC in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 917</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%203%20Hare%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843)

Melbourne Authority v Anshun</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589</a>, whereby a party may be
precluded from maintaining a cause of action in proceedings if he unreasonably
did not raise it in earlier
proceedings.  Hunter J said that AT's concern was
that a passage in the reasons of the Full Court of the Federal Court in
<i>Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1299.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1299</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2057%20FCR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 57 FCR 287</a> at 295 could
mean that there could be Anshun estoppel where the party unreasonably did not
cross-claim against a third party, as
distinct from defend or cross-claim
defensively against the opposite party to the proceedings.  
<P>

36   	On the return to the application as envisaged by his
Honour AT had revised its cross-claim.  The contribution was now pursuant
to s
5(1)(c) of the LR Act "or in equity".  There were added to the breaches of
duties owed to the NRMA allegations that directors
contravened s 996 of the
Law, were involved in contraventions by Association, Insurance and Holdings of
s 52 of the TP Act and ss
995 and 996 of the Law, and breached fiduciary
duties.  The allegations were mainly to do with disclosure of disadvantages,
but now
including some disadvantages going beyond those identified by the Full
Court of the Federal Court or on which the NRMA had relied
in these
proceedings.  But the allegations now went beyond disadvantages, and new paras
28 and following included breach of duty
in failing to disclose matters
material to taking the scheme of arrangement route rather than the resolutions
in general meetings
route.  Some differences between directors were recognised.
The framing of the cross-claim was far from satisfactory, but it is not
necessary to go further into it.
<P>

37   	With respect, Hunter J correctly doubted whether AT could
be Anshun estopped in any separate proceedings brought against the
directors.
Neither the facts in <i>Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i> nor the
passage in question lend support to that view, and the Full Court cited with
approval the analysis in<i> Rahme v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i> (NSWCA,
20 December 1991, unreported) whereby <i>Port of Melbourne Authority v
Anshun</i> was authority for the propositions -
<P>

" ...1, that Wigram VC's extended principle as stated in <i>Henderson</i> is
accepted as good law by the High Court;  2,  that the principle applies inter
alia, to ... a proceeding in which a party is asserting
a cause of action which
could have been raised, but was not, in a previous proceeding in which the
<i>same party</i> was asserting a different cause of action based on
substantially the same facts against the <i>same party</i> as the second
proceeding is being brought;  and 3, that the extended principle of
<i>Henderson</i> will be applied to the second proceeding when it was
unreasonable for the party asserting the cause of action in that second
proceeding
to refrain from raising it in the earlier proceeding against the
same <i>opponent party</i>."  (emphasis added)
<P>

38   	Shortly after the application was before his Honour it was
held in <i>Foodco Group Pty Ltd v Northgan Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2083%20FCR%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 83 FCR 356</a> that
Anshun estoppel did not operate in a manner which would preclude AT from
cross-claiming against the directors.  Miba Pty Ltd
brought proceedings against
Foodco alleging misleading conduct in relation to franchising a food outlet in
a shopping centre.  It
was held that Foodco had misstated the average weekly
sales of a food outlet operator in the shopping centre.  Foodco had obtained
sales figures from Northgan.  After being found liable to Miba Pty Ltd, Foodco
brought proceedings against Northgan, alleging misleading
conduct in the
provision of the sales figures and claiming recovery of the amount payable to
Miba Pty Ltd.  Northgan applied to stay
or dismiss the proceedings, amongst
other grounds because of Anshun estoppel:  it said that the claim should have
been litigated
as a cross-claim in the proceedings brought by Miba Pty Ltd.
The application was rejected, not only because it was arguable that
there was
no Anshun estoppel (at 362) but because on the law as it presently stood Anshun
estoppel did not "apply to a non-party"
(at 360-1).
<P>

39   	In the present case the directors declined to concede that
they could not rely on Anshun estoppel against AT, but were less
than
forthright in propounding its application.  Such taking of positions is perhaps
understandable, but regrettable.  I was not
asked to rule on the matter.  As at
present advised I regard the prospects of an Anshun estoppel should AT bring
the cross-claim
by way of fresh proceedings as remote, if not ephemeral.
<P>

40   	But for a strained attempt to extend the cross-claim to
Gambotto liability via the allegations about failure to disclose matters
material to taking the scheme of arrangement route rather than the resolutions
in general meetings route, it was concerned with free
shares/disadvantages
liability.  When the NRMA failed on free shares/disadvantages liability most of
the proposed cross-claim could
lead nowhere, because even if there had been
breaches of duty it would not provide contributory responsibility for AT's
liability
to the NRMA, and I have difficulty in seeing how the attempted
extension to Gambotto liability could lead to contributory responsibility
if
there had been breaches of duty.  My findings in the reasons of 13 May 1999
would not be encouraging to AT in asserting the breaches
of duty in either
respect.  Up to a point AT acknowledged these matters, in saying that the
cross-claim should not be heard until
after any appeals from my decision in the
proceedings as between the NRMA and the defendants had been resolved.  It
proposed a course
of declarations rather than judgments, expressing what I
regard as a misplaced concern that, even if the proposed cross-claims were
filed pursuant to a grant of leave, judgments as between the NRMA and the
defendants would render me functus officio.
<P>

41   	In what immediately follows I will assume that there is a
prospect of Anshun estoppel against AT of more substance than remote
or
ephemeral, and that there is an arguable case for obtaining contribution from
the directors.  Even with those assumptions in favour
of AT, I would not grant
leave to file the cross-claim against the directors.
<P>

42   	The key to the cross-claim procedure (in earlier times the
third party procedure) is that the cross-defendant will be bound
by the result
as between the plaintiff and the defendant;  as well, there will normally be
the practical advantage that the rights
and obligations of all concerned are
determined in the least disruptive and most cost efficient manner in the one
hearing, even if
the hearing involves separation to some extent of the trial of
issues as between various parties.  That has been trite legal knowledge
at
least since <i>Barclays Bank v Tom</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281923%29%201%20KB%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1923) 1 KB 221</a> per Scrutton LJ at 223-4
-
<P>

"Now I think it is important to keep clearly in mind what the third party
procedure is.  A plaintiff has a claim against a defendant.
 The defendant
thinks if he is liable he has a claim over against a third party.  With that
matter between the defendant and the
third party the plaintiff has obviously
nothing to do.  He is not concerned with the question whether the defendant has
a remedy
against somebody else.  His remedy is against the defendant.  But the
defendant is much interested in getting the third party bound
by the result of
the trial between the plaintiff and himself, for otherwise he might be at a
great disadvantage if, having fought
the case against the plaintiff and lost,
he had then to fight the case against the third party possibly on different
materials, with
the risk that a different result might be arrived at.  The
object of the third party procedure is then in the first place to get
the third
party bound by the decision between the plaintiff and the defendant.  In the
next place it is directed to getting the question
between the defendant and the
third party decided as soon as possible after the decision between the
plaintiff and the defendant,
so that the defendant may not be in the position
of having to wait a considerable time before he establishes his right of
indemnity
against the third party while all the time the plaintiff is enforcing
his judgment against the defendant.  And thirdly, it is directed
to saving the
extra expense which would be involved by two independent actions."
<P>

43   	This description of the objective of the third party
procedure was taken up by the Full Court in this State in <i>Standen v G H
Varley Ltd</i> (1956) 56 SR 346 at 348, and in <i>Godfrey v The Nominal
Defendant</i> (1963) 63 SR 412 at 414 it was said that it is of the essence of
third party procedure that the common issues should be tried together
in a
single proceeding to which all the interested persons are parties.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 63</a>
and 78 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> accord with this, and the description of the
objective was also taken up in relation to the cross-claim procedure in
<i>Sandtara Pty Ltd v Abigroup Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/294.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 294</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 5</a> at 8-9.
<P>

44   	Because AT sought to bring the cross-claim late, and then
concurred in the deferral of its application until after the reasons
for
judgment in the proceedings, the objective can not be realised.  The lateness
of AT's application is marked when <i>Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of
Australia</i> was decided in 1995, and no satisfactory explanation for it was
given.  The directors are not bound by the findings or conclusions
in my
reasons of 13 May 1999.  If AT were now permitted to cross-claim against the
directors, everything in the proceedings would
be open as between AT and the
directors, even if some common ground flowed from what has already occurred.
And, given the prospect
of appeals from my decision, the cross-claim can not be
decided (if decision be necessary) for some time, with inevitable waste of
resources and detriment to a proper hearing.
<P>

45   	Further, whatever might come out in an additional hearing
as between AT and the directors, including as to credibility of
the directors
who gave evidence before me, could be material to the findings or conclusions
in the reasons of 13 May 1999.  There
is the prospect of either revisiting the
claims as between the NRMA and the defendants, possibly as between the
defendants themselves,
or having inconsistent findings and/or conclusions in
the same proceedings.  I do not think that is to be countenanced.
<P>

46   	If AT wishes to claim over against the directors, subject
to Anshun estoppel it will be in no worse position by doing so in
separate
proceedings brought against them.  Any Anshun damage has already been done, in
that there has been a hearing and reasons
for judgment without the raising of
the cross-claim, and that there remains only the step of formal judgment.  In
the circumstances
I have described I can see no sufficient reason to save AT
from any Anshun estoppel which there might be, due to its lateness and
concurrence earlier mentioned, by granting leave to cross-claim against
directors in the present proceedings.  This is quite a different
situation from
that in <i>Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australia
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 543</a>, to which AT referred (see at 546, 554, 556, 558,
562), where there had not been reasons for judgment and adjournment of the
hearing
was possible.
<P>

47   	If either of the assumptions I have made be unfounded, for
that reason as well the application for leave to cross-claim should
be refused.
It is sufficient to address the assumption in relation to Anshun estoppel.  The
remote, if not ephemeral, prospect of
an Anshun estoppel is in itself such that
in the exercise of discretion I would in any event refuse leave - I consider
the assumption
so close to unfounded as to make that a proper course given the
other circumstances I have described.
<P>

48   	The difficulties in AT's application were great on 22
April 1998;  when the application was left for determination after the
delivery
of reasons in the proceedings as between the NRMA and the defendants, they
became insuperable.  I do not find it necessary
to refer to evidence from a
number of the directors as to hardship they would suffer if the proposed
cross-claim were permitted.
 That could only support refusal of leave to file
the cross-claim, but the significance of the evidence is undermined by
acceptance
by all parties that, subject to any Anshun estoppel, AT could bring
separate proceedings against the directors.
<P>

49   	AT's application for leave to cross-claim against
directors should be dismissed with costs.
<P>

<b>(d)  AAH's cross-claim against directors</b>
<P>

50   	If AT's application for leave to cross-claim against
directors was remarkably late, AAH's similar application was astoundingly
late.
It was made by notice of motion filed on 28 July 1998, more than two months
into the hearing.  At least as ultimately maintained,
the directors were the
same as the directors the subject of AT's application.  
<P>

51   	AAH's cross-claim was similar to, but not the same as,
AT's cross-claim.  It claimed contribution pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of
the LR Act
and on principles of co-ordinate liability, alleged breaches by the directors
of fiduciary duty, involvement in conduct
in contravention of s 52 of the TP
Act and ss 995 and 996 of the Law, and breaches of general duties of care.  It
put the obligation
of the directors at the level of ensuring that there was
full disclosure in the prospectus of everything material to enable members
to
decide how to vote, not to mislead them, and to present a fair and balanced
picture, which was wider than AT's cross-claim.  It
did not have the further
allegations in paras 28 and following of AT's cross-claim, and so did not
attempt to extend to Gambotto
liability. 
<P>

52   	In the notice of motion filed on 28 July 1998 AAH asked
that the hearing of the motion be adjourned to a date after delivery
of reasons
in the proceedings and before the entry of judgment.  The notice of motion was
first returned on 14 August 1998, but with
incomplete service.  All concerned
were present on 28 August 1998, when by consent the application was adjourned
to be dealt with
at the same time as AT's application for leave to cross-claim
against directors.  
<P>

53   	AAH's application could be in no better position than that
of AT - indeed, its prospects would not be enhanced by the facts
that AAH
opposed AT's application and then took months to decide to jump on the band
wagon.  
<P>

54   	AAH recognised that, in the light of my reasons of 13 May
1999, there was no present need to prosecute the cross-claim because
it was
confined to free shares/disadvantages liability:  the cross-claim would be
relevant only if there were a successful appeal
from my decision in relation to
free shares/disadvantages liability.  It submitted that its application should
be stood over generally,
or to a fixed date well into the future, or should be
now granted but with the hearing of the cross-claim stood over to a fixed date
in the future, against the possibility that the NRMA's failure in relation to
free shares/disadvantages liability did not survive
an appeal.  
<P>

55   	AAH acknowledged that it could simply commence fresh
proceedings against the directors, but raised the spectre of Anshun estoppel
while saying that it seemed quite unlikely that any Anshun estoppel argument
could succeed.  The reasons I have given in relation
to AT's application mean
that I do not think that leave should be given, nor do I see any reason to
postpone the determination of
the application.  AAH's application for leave to
cross-claim against directors should be dismissed with costs.
<P>

<b>(e)	AT's further cross-claim against Mr Heydon</b>
<P>

56   	AT had cross-claimed against Mr Heydon for indemnity or
contribution, see para 159 of the reasons of 13 May 1999.  Following
publication of the reasons of that date it announced that it was considering a
further cross-claim against him.  Pursuant to directions
then given, on 20 May
1999 AT filed a notice of motion seeking leave to file the further cross-claim.

<P>

57   	The cross-claim, in its later revised form, alleged breach
of a duty of care owed by Mr Heydon to AT, said to be a duty of
care "in
substantially similar terms" to the duty of care alleged by the NRMA to be owed
by Mr Heydon to the NRMA;  it alleged that
Mr Heydon was in breach of that duty
of care, both in relation to <i>Gambotto's case</i> and in relation to free
shares (the conjunction with the disadvantages question was unclear), and that
AT suffered loss by reason
of the breach of duty being the amount of its
liability to the NRMA.  The framing of the cross-claim may well have been
deficient
in many respects, but this was its substance and it is unnecessary to
go into the deficiencies. 
<P>

58   	Through the affidavit of Mr Peter Kennedy sworn 20 May
1999, it was said that the High Court delivered judgment in <i>Astley v
Austrust Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 6</a> on 4 March 1999;  that the parties in the present
proceedings were given leave on 23 March 1999 to lodge supplementary written
submissions
on that decision by 13 April 1999;  and that - 
<P>

"Until such submissions were called for, it was not considered necessary to
examine directly the liability of the Third Defendant
to the Second Defendants
independently of the claim for indemnity or contribution made in the Third
Cross-Claim.  Once the immediate
consequences of the decision in <i>Astley v
Austrust Ltd</i> became apparent, I instructed Counsel to advise on this
liability.  Counsel have advised that the Third Cross-Claim may not, in certain
circumstances permit the Second Defendants to claim contribution from the Third
Defendant and for more abundant caution the Second
Defendant should seek the
leave of the Court to file a Further Cross-Claim."
<P>

59   	The last sentence in this extract was objected to, but was
allowed on the basis that I would pay regard to the documentary
evidence
revealing what counsel had advised rather than to Mr Kennedy's summation.
<P>

60   	The description in submissions of the occasion for the
further cross-claim was to the following effect.  Each of AAH, AT and
Mr Heydon
cross-claimed against the other for contribution.  If the NRMA were
contributorily negligent, before <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i> each could expect
the same reduction in its liability to the NRMA.  The contribution between AAH,
AT and Mr Heydon would then operate
on common liabilities to the NRMA.  As a
result of the decision of the High Court in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i>, if
the NRMA were contributorily negligent AAT and AT could not have reductions in
their liability to the NRMA, but Mr Heydon could.
 The contribution between
AAH, AT and Mr Heydon would operate on different liabilities to the NRMA, and
it was possible, if not likely,
that AT would end up with a greater ultimate
burden than it would otherwise have had because Mr Heydon would start with a
lesser
liability to the NRMA.  An analogy with <i>Ellesmere Brewery Co v
Cooper</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281896%29%201%20QB%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1896) 1 QB 75</a> was drawn:  <i>Street v Retravision (NSW) Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1197.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1197</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20135%20ALR%20168" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 135 ALR 168</a> and <i>Bialkower v Acohs Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20154%20ALR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 154 ALR 534</a> were
also referred to.  So it was necessary for AT to find a way to obtain greater
contribution from Mr Heydon and lessen its ultimate
burden, and so the
cross-claim.
<P>

61   	When application for leave to file a cross-claim is first
made after reasons for judgment have been published, an explanation
for the
time at which it is made is called for.  This explanation is unsatisfactory.

<P>

62   	First, if indeed the decision of the High Court in
<i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i> was the occasion for the further cross-claim
against Mr Heydon, AT gave no thought for itself to the significance of the
decision,
and was only caused to do so by the Court's invitation to provide
further submissions.  It then did not act promptly, but announced
and made its
application only after the publication of the reasons of 13 May 1999.  The
delay meant that findings and conclusions
were made and reached, and published,
without the consideration or the opportunity for consideration of the evidence
material to
the cross-claim.
<P>

63   	Secondly, the further submissions were provoked by the
High Court's holding that contributory negligence is not available
as a defence
to a claim for breach of contract.  It is plain that AT's cross-claim goes
beyond rectifying a perceived consequence
of the decision of the High Court.
If successful, the cross-claim would give AT complete indemnity, regardless of
what might have
been an appropriate contribution from Mr Heydon, and
contributory negligence on the part of AT would not necessarily bring its
ultimate
burden to a pre-<i>Astley v Austrust Ltd </i>position.  The
documentary evidence revealing what counsel had advised was rather obscure, but
the cross-claim was a way of reducing
AT's ultimate burden which could have
been taken up when the existing cross-claim for contribution was filed.
<P>

64   	There is something of a parallel here with an element of
Gambotto liability in these proceedings.  There had long been doubt
about
reduction of damages for contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff
where the defendant was concurrently liable in
contract and tort for breach of
a duty of care.  Decisions could be found either way as recently as the last
decade (for example,
<i>Bains Harding Construction &amp; Roofing (Aust) Pty Ltd
v McCredie Richmond &amp; Partners Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 437</a> yes,
<i>Arthur Young &amp; Co v WA Chip &amp; Pulp Co Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20WAR%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) WAR 100</a>
no).  The special leave to appeal to the High Court in<i> Astley v Austrust
Ltd</i>, from the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South
Australia  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2067%20SASR%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 67 SASR 209</a>, was granted on 11 December 1997.  A High Court
decision could settle the matter, and could go either way.  It might have been
argued
that it was incumbent on AT to pay regard to the possibility that the
High Court might decide as it did, and to protect itself from
a possible
holding whereby it could not have a reduction in its liability to the NRMA but
Mr Heydon could, by including in its existing
cross-claim for contribution
(which was filed some months after 11 December 1997) this way of reducing its
ultimate burden.  Needless
to say, Mr Heydon eschewed such an argument.  I put
it aside.
<P>

65   	In my opinion AT's application for leave to further
cross-claim against Mr Heydon should be refused.  The late time at which
it was
made, without satisfactory explanation, does not of itself bring that outcome.
Nor do I treat as of itself bringing that outcome
the fact that, if the
description of the occasion for the further cross-claim be taken at face value,
there is presently no need
for the cross-claim because I have found that the
NRMA was not contributorily negligent:  for reasons I have given, the
description
can not be taken at face value, and the cross-claim could arise for
consideration quite apart from a successful appeal on contributory
negligence.
AT was equivocal in submissions about dealing with the cross-claim even before
any appeal, and for reasons to come I
do not think that could be excluded.  
<P>

66   	The cross-claim is not just a different legal framework
for or use of facts and issues already in the proceedings.  Whether
Mr Heydon
owed a duty of care to AT, and its terms, was no part of the proceedings.
Whether AT relied on Mr Heydon was part of the
proceedings, in the sense that
AT's defence as filed to the NRMA's claims included that it was not retained to
advise in relation
to <i>Gambotto's case</i> or its impact on the proposal and
that the NRMA relied on the advice of AAH and Mr Heydon and not on the advice
of AT in that respect,
and in the further sense that Mr Bateman's evidence was
to the effect that he left that matter to AAH (see paras 319-328 and 764-769
of
the reasons of 13 May 1999).  The cross-claim raises new facts and issues,
including a major issue to some extent inconsistent
with AT's case at the
hearing.  
<P>

67   	What has earlier been said about the objective of the
cross-claim procedure may be recalled.  AT and Mr Heydon are bound by
my
findings and conclusions already stated, but that provides its own difficulty.
The additional issues would give rise to possible
inconsistent findings or
conclusions, or at least to further evidence which might lead to different
findings or conclusions there
being a similarity in this respect to the AT
cross-claim against directors.  Whatever might come out in an additional
hearing as
between AT and Mr Heydon, including as to the credibility of (for
example) Mr Bateman, could be material to the findings or conclusions
in the
reasons of 13 May 1999.  I see no reason to ignore the submission by counsel
for Mr Heydon that it is likely that aspects
of Mr Heydon's case, specifically
the cross-examination of Mr Bateman, would have been conducted differently had
the cross-claim
been on foot.  There is the prospect noted in relation to the
AT cross-claim against directors, and it is no more to be countenanced
in
relation to the further cross-claim against Mr Heydon.
<P>

68   	In my opinion that is a substantial reason for refusing
the leave sought.  That the application is made after the publication
of the
reasons of 13 May 1999 works strongly against it, and I do not accept that AT
was confronted on 4 March 1999 with a new set
of ground rules justifying the
late grant of leave:  the rather remote analogy with a more stringent test for
reopening after delivery
of judgment invoked by Mr Heydon, see <i>Smith v New
South Wales Bar Association</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176 CLR 256</a> at 266-7, is unnecessary.
At the last minute AT suggested that it might suffer an Anshun estoppel.  There
is more to be said for
that than in the case of the cross-claims against
directors, but I express no view.  Even assuming that there is a prospect of
Anshun
estoppel against AT, again any Anshun damage has already been done, and
Mr Heydon as an individual involved in these proceedings
for some years should
not be further exposed (beyond, of course, by the exercise of appellate rights
and their consequences) to the
strain of litigation.  In the circumstances I
have described, again I see no sufficient reason to save AT from any Anshun
estoppel
there might be, weighed against the reasons for refusing the leave
sought
<P>

69   	AT's application for leave to further cross-claim against
Mr Heydon should be dismissed with costs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

70   	As noted in the reasons of 13 May 1999, the proceedings
were conducted on the basis that it did not matter which of Association,
Insurance or Holdings retained the solicitors (see para 101).  No one suggested
that it mattered whether judgment was in favour of
one or other, or all, of the
plaintiffs.  The judgment will be in favour of all the plaintiffs, but of
course with payment in total
of no more than the judgment sum.
<P>

71   	The orders to conclude these proceedings at first instance
are as follows:
<P>

(1)	Dismiss with costs the second defendants' notice of motion filed on 8 April
1998.
<P>

(2)	Dismiss with costs the first defendants' notice of motion filed on 28 July
1998.
<P>

(3)	Dismiss with costs the second defendants' notice of motion filed on 20 May
1999.
<P>

(4)	Judgment for the plaintiffs against each of the defendants for
$32,068,910.
<P>

(5)	Order that the defendants pay two thirds of the plaintiffs' costs.
<P>

(6)	Dismiss the cross-claims by the defendants against the plaintiffs.
<P>

(7)	Order that each of the defendants recover from each of the other defendants
contribution of one third of the amounts payable
pursuant to orders (4) and
(5).
