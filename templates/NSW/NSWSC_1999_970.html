<b>JUDGMENT	(Withdraw election;  Leave to commence </b>
<P>

<b>proceedings -ss 151A &amp; 151D WCA)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By summons filed 3 June 1999 the plaintiff seeks
firstly, an order pursuant to s 151A(5) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></b>
1987 (the Act) to withdraw the election constituted by his acceptance of lump
sum compensation pursuant to the consent award made
in proceedings No 10591/95
in the Compensation Court of New South Wales between the plaintiff as applicant
and the defendant as respondent.
 Secondly, the plaintiff seeks an order
pursuant to s 151D(2) of the Act granting him leave to commence proceedings
against the defendant
for damages in respect of an injury suffered on or about
13 January 1995 during the course of his employment with the defendant.
 The
plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 27 May 1999 and the affidavit of Martin
H F Bell sworn 23 June 1999.  The defendant
did not rely upon any affidavit
evidence.
<P>

2  	I carefully observed the plaintiff being cross examined and I
formed the view that his evidence was truthful.  For the purpose
of this
hearing I find the following facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 13 February 1963.  He is married with two
children aged 6 and 5 years.
<P>

(2)	In November 1990 the plaintiff commenced employment with the defendant as a
fitter/welder.
<P>

(3)	On or about 13 January 1995 the plaintiff sustained an injury to his lower
back and left leg in the course of employment. His
injury occurred while he was
attempting to move approximately 50 metal bars across trellises onto metal
rollers with another employer.
 The bundle of metal bars weighed approximately
300 kilograms.
<P>

(4)	On 16 January 1995 the plaintiff's general practitioner Dr Nikolic attended
the plaintiff at his house for consultation in respect
of his severe low back
pain which radiated down his legs.  The plaintiff was unable to attend the
surgery as the pain was so severe.
<P>

(5)	In February 1995 Dr Nikolic referred the plaintiff to Dr Beer an
orthopaedic surgeon.  Dr Beer diagnosed a large disc protrusion
and opined to
the plaintiff that he may require surgery.  He assessed that the plaintiff has
permanent impairment of the back and
he would have a loss of efficient use of
the back of 7% of the whole person.  
<P>

(6)	In February 1995 the plaintiff saw Dr Segelov a neuro-surgeon who raised
the option of spinal surgery.  The plaintiff discussed
this with Dr Nikolic and
was reluctant to undergo any surgery.  Instead the plaintiff decided to try
conservative treatment and gradual
rehabilitation.  In September 1995 Dr
Segelov assessed the plaintiff's permanent impairment of the back at 30% and a
permanent loss
of efficient use of the left lower limb at or above the knee
taking into account the whole limb of 12%.
<P>

(7)	In March 1995 the plaintiff spent five days in leg traction and after his
discharge he felt worse.
<P>

(8)	On 13 June 1995 the plaintiff consulted the solicitors Firths - The
Compensation Lawyers.  He spoke to Ms Jenny Fraser about
his compensation
rights and she advised him of the steps to be taken to obtain lump sum
compensation.  
<P>

(9)	The plaintiff's solicitor did not at any time give him any advice in
relation to his common law rights.
<P>

(10)	On 11 July 1995 Dr Collins agreed that surgery should be carried out.  Dr
Collins assessed the plaintiff as having permanent
impairment of the back at
20% and as having permanent percentage loss of efficient use of the left leg at
or above the knee at 16%.
<P>

(11)	In September 1995 Dr Blake diagnosed a significant disc prolapse at L4/5
producing damage to the L5 nerve root supplying the
left leg.  His most likely
prognosis was gradual improvement over a period of months and there should be
further consideration given
to surgery.  He assessed the plaintiff as having
percentage permanent impairment of the back at 30% and the percentage permanent
loss of efficient use of the left leg at or above the knee, taking into
consideration loss below the knee at 15%.
<P>

(12)	Throughout 1995 the plaintiff's symptoms of severe low back pain radiating
into his legs remained constant.
<P>

(13)	On 29 February 1996 upon the advice of his then solicitors the plaintiff
agreed to terms of settlement in respect of 25% permanent
impairment of his
back and 10% loss of use of his left leg or above his knee.  On 29 February
1996 an award was made.  The plaintiff
subsequently received $49,471.35 in
settlement monies that he deposited into his bank account.  
<P>

(14)	The plaintiff was not made aware by his solicitors that by banking the
monies he had made an election not to bring common law
proceedings.
<P>

(15)	In February 1996 the plaintiff did not believe that it was likely that he
would be forced to undergo an operation.  He knew
that he was restricted in
body movements such as sitting, bending and twisting.  He knew that he had been
told by Drs Segelov, Nikolic
and Beer that he needed surgery to fix his back
problems but he was not quite sure that it would do so.  He did not think that
without
the surgery his back condition would get worse.
<P>

(16)	From 1996 and 1997 the plaintiff's symptoms remained relatively
constant.
<P>

(17)	In April 1997 the plaintiff was referred to Dr Compton, a neuro-surgeon.
In September 1997 after investigations Dr Compton
held the view that the
plaintiff required surgical treatment to maximise his chances of recovery to
allow him to return to work.
<P>

(18)	In July 1998 the plaintiff's symptoms became much worse and he again saw
Dr Compton and had a myelogram which showed a very
significant disc prolapse at
L4-L5.  The plaintiff still remained reluctant to undergo surgery.
<P>

(19)	On 10 September 1998 the plaintiff suffered severe back and leg pain and
was unable to walk and was taken to Liverpool Hospital
by ambulance.  He was
diagnosed with caudia equina compression caused by the disc protrusion.  The
consequences were reduced mobility
of lower limbs, faecal and urinary
incontinence and erectile impotence.  These consequences have led to the
plaintiff suffering from
significant depression (report of Dr Nikolic dated 30
March 1999).
<P>

(20)	On 11 September 1998 Dr Compton performed a laminectomy and discectomy at
Liverpool Hospital.  
<P>

(21)	On 26 February 1999 the plaintiff attended Martin Bell &amp; Co solicitors
and spoke to Mr Bell about his rights at law.  Mr
Bell raised the question of
common law rights and this was the first time that such rights had been brought
to the plaintiff's attention.
 Mr Bell arranged for the plaintiff to confer
with Mr Jay Anderson of Counsel for the purposes of obtaining advice in
relation to
the bringing of common law proceedings.
<P>

(22)	On 10 April 1999 Dr Brenner stated that the plaintiff suffered an acute
injury to his back on 13 January 1995 but this deteriorated
acutely with his
disc protrusion around 11 September 1998.  He said that this latter
deterioration of the original injury had resulted
in complete loss of sexual
function (100%).  There was also 100% loss of normal bladder function and that
both were of a direct consequence
of the plaintiff's original injury but the
outcome of this was not fully manifested until September 1998.
<P>

(23)	On 27 May 1999 the plaintiff had a conference with Mr Anderson who advised
him that he had strong prospects of succeeding upon
a common law damages claim
against his former employer, subject to obtaining leave of the court to revoke
his election and to bring
the claim out of time.  
<P>

(24)	On 3 June 1999 the summons to withdraw election was filed.
<P>

3  	Section 151A(5) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></b>
provides:
<P>

<b>"If:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	a person elects to claim permanent loss compensation in respect of an
injury, and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	after the election is made, the injury causes a further material
deterioration in the person's medical condition that, had it
existed at the
time of the election, would have entitled the person to additional permanent
loss compensation, and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	at the time of the election, there was no reasonable cause to believe
that the further deterioration would occur,</b>
<P>

<b>the person may, with the leave of the court and on such terms (if any) as
the court thinks fit, revoke the election and commence proceedings
in the court
for the recovery of damages in respect of the injury."</b>
<P>

4  	The plaintiff referred to <b><u>Brennan Taylor v State of New
South Wales </u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/158.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 158</a> and <b><u>Francis v Dunlop</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported 16 December 1998).
<P>

5  	The defendant submitted that the plaintiff's loss of sexual
function was a result of the surgery and not caused by the accident
 and
therefore it was not an injury as defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151A(5)(a).</a>  However, Dr Brenner
is of the opinion that the loss of sexual function and bowel and bladder
control is a direct consequence of
the original injury.  Further the plaintiff
suffered a caudia equina compression caused by the disc protrusion which led to
faecal
and urinary incontinence the day before surgery.  It is my view that the
loss of sexual, bowel and bladder control is attributable
to the accident and
not the surgery performed.  If the loss of sexual, bowel and bladder function
was not linked to surgery, the
defendant conceded that the plaintiff had
satisfied <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151A(5)(a)</a> and (b).
<P>

6  	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151(c)</a> the defendant submitted that as the
plaintiff had firstly, been told by the doctors treating him that he needed
surgery;  secondly,
understood the mechanism of injury and thirdly, there were
significant restrictions placed on him, he would more probably than not
have
believed a further deterioration would occur.  The defendant submitted that
"the further deterioration" should be interpreted
in the context of "like"
deterioration.  It is my view that the deterioration cannot be interpreted to
mean that the deterioration
has to be of the "same kind" or "like" the
deterioration that had previously occurred to fall within the definition of
"the further
deterioration".
<P>

7  	In <b><u>Brennan Taylor</u></b> the Court of Appeal considered
the interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151A(5)</a> and referred to <b><u>Francis</u></b> where the
court was divided on its meaning.  Handley JA dissented in
<b><u>Francis</u></b> and maintained his dissenting view in <b><u>Brennan
Taylor</u></b>.  An application for leave to appeal has been lodged in
<b><u>Brennan Taylor</u></b>.  In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151A(5)(c)</a> Giles JA referred to
a passage of Fitzgerald AJA in <b><u>Francis</u></b> namely:
<P>

<b>"`Would a <u>reasonable person</u> with the information available to the
appellant when he elected to accept permanent loss compensation on 30 June 1993
<u>have then had any cause to believe</u> that his injury in respect of which
such compensation was accepted <u>would cause a further material deterioration
in his medical condition</u> that, had it existed at the time of the election,
would have entitled the appellant to additional permanent loss compensation?'
(Emphasis
added)</b>
<P>

<b>Because of the awkward phraseology of the section, I should elaborate
briefly.  The section required an absence of reasonable cause
for belief.  On
the other hand, the belief with which it is concerned is not a belief as to
what <u>might</u> occur, but a belief as to what <u>would</u> occur (Cf
<i>Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20266" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 266</a>, 291-292, per Barwick
CJ;  303-304 per Kitto J).  Knowledge of medical advice that further
deterioration probably would occur provides
reasonable cause to believe that
deterioration would occur in the absence of any contrary opinion, but does not
necessarily do so
if there is other medical advice that further deterioration
probably would not occur.  In the latter event, the question which I
have posed
would be answered in the affirmative unless, on a consideration of all the
advice, a reasonable person would conclude
that, while further deterioration
might occur it would probably not occur."</b>
<P>

8  	At paragraph (43) Giles JA stated that:
<P>

<b>"Paragraph (c) must, of course, be read as a whole.  Regard to the composite
notion of reasonable cause to believe that a future event
will occur, in my
view, means that the further deterioration must be more than a possible event
(because it can not readily be said
that a possible event will occur) but not a
certain event (because cause to believe and the futurity deny certainty), and
that the
belief must be more than suspicion (because reasonable cause should
found more than suspicion) but less than complete confidence
(because
reasonable cause and the futurity deny complete confidence).  The reference to
reasonable cause connotes the existence of
facts sufficient to induce the
relevant belief in a reasonable person (cf <i>George v Rockett</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170
CLR 104</a> at 112).  Assuming without deciding the field of knowledge described
above, the effect of para (c) is that it must be asked whether
a reasonable
person knowing what was known or ought to have been known to the worker would
expect the further deterioration in fact
suffered by the worker as something
more probable than not.  If the answer is no, para (c) is satisfied."</b>
<P>

9  	Sheppard JA stated that Giles JA preferred the approach adopted
by Fitzgerald AJA and prefers generally the approach adopted
by Giles JA.
<P>

10  	It is conceded that loss of sexual function would have entitled
the plaintiff to additional permanent loss compensation.
<P>

11  	As at February 1996 when the plaintiff accepted the election to
claim permanent loss compensation, he had been told by Drs
Nikolic, Beer and
Segelov that an operation to his spine was necessary (t 2.15) but he did not
know that without surgery he would
get worse.  He knew that the material in the
disc was extruding and putting pressure on his spinal cord.  He knew that he
could not
do any heavy lifting, twisting and bending.  Throughout 1995 and 1996
his symptoms of very severe low back pain and pain radiating
to his legs
remained relatively constant. None of the medical reports anticipated that the
plaintiff would in the future experience
a caudia equina compression which led
to faecal and urinary incontinence and erectile impotence.  As at February 1996
a reasonable
man would not have had cause to believe that this material
deterioration would have occurred.
<P>

12  	However, a reasonable person who was appraised of the above
information as at February 1996 would not have expected the further
material
deterioration in fact suffered by the worker as something more probable than
not.  The test in para (c) is satisfied.  The
plaintiff has satisfied the tests
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151A(5)(a)</a>, (b) and (c).  Accordingly leave should be granted to revoke
the election made by the plaintiff in February 1996.
<P>

13  	I turn now to consider whether leave to commence proceedings
should be granted.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 151D(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></b>
provides:
<P>

<b>"a person to whom compensation is payable under this Act is not entitled to
commence court proceedings for damages in respect of the
injury concerned
against the employer liable to pay for compensation more than three years after
the date on which the injury was
received except with the leave of the court in
which the proceedings are to be taken."</b>
<P>

14  	I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has established that he
has a real case to advance.  It has been held in extension
of time applications
pursuant <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 58</a> and 60G of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a></b> that the applicant
bears an evidentiary and persuasive onus which, in the absence of concession,
requires material to be adduced
which demonstrates that the dilatory plaintiff
has a real case to advance.  (See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v Bailey</u></b>
(unreported, NSWSC, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Ortado v Bailey</u></b> (unreported,
NSWSC, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Lewis v Bailey</u></b> (unreported, NSWSC, 1 May
1997);  <b><u>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (unreported,
NSWCA, 26 February 1998) and <b><u>Dow Corning Australia Pty Ltd v
Paton</u></b>, <b><u>Meares v Paton</u></b> (unreported NSW CA, 24 April
1998).
<P>

15  	These cases accord with Hunt J's (as he then was) view in
<b><u>Martin v Abbott Australasia Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 430</a> at p
443 in relation to a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 58(2)</a> application when he says that the plaintiff must
make it appear that the evidence that establishes a cause of action exists and
that
it is available to be adduced at trial.  I can see no reason why this
rationale should not be applied to applications to extend time
under s 151D of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></b>.  It would be pointless to extend time and
to put the parties and the court to the time and expense of a trial if the
plaintiff does
not have a real case to advance or that there is evidence to
establish that a cause of action exists.  The defendant submitted that
the
plaintiff has not established that there is a real case to advance.  The
plaintiff was employed by the defendant.  On 13 January
1995 he injured his
back while he was attempting to lift 50 metal bars which weighed approximately
300 kilograms across trellises
onto metal rollers with a employee.  It is not
clear precisely how the accident occurred, however the employer owed a duty of
care
to the plaintiff when he was lifting heavy objects.  There is medical
evidence that links his injuries to the accident and that he
is permanently and
totally unfit for work.  It is my view that the plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  
<P>

16  	I turn now to consider whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period.  The nature of the discretion conferred
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
31(2)</a> of the <b>Queensland Limitations Act</b> was considered by the High Court
in <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186

unreported, 28 July 1997).  Sperling J in <b><u>McAndrew v Wyoming Nursing Home
Pty Ltd</u></b> (NSWSC, 21 November 1997;  5 December 1997 unreported) held
that <b><u>Taylor</u></b> and <b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b>
(Court of Appeal 28 July 1997, unreported) were applicable generally to
statutes of limitation which incorporate provisions for extension
of time in
the absence of any specific statutory restriction or requirement as to what
particular consideration should or should
not be taken into account.
<P>

17  	I turn to consider the effects of delay.  In
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J referred to the effects of delay in the now often
quoted passage at p 8 which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Secondly, it
is oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought
long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Thirdly,
people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on
the basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

18  	McHugh J at p 10 continued:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question. </b>
<P>

<b>Accordingly, when an applicant seeks an extension of time to commence an
action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has
the positive burden
of demonstrating that the justice of the case requires that extension."</b>
<P>

19  	and at page 11 he continued:
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.  In such a situation, actual injustice
to
one party must occur.  It seems more in accord with the legislative policy
underlying limitation periods that the plaintiff's
lost right should not be
revived than that the defendant should have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

20  	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed
themselves in the following terms.
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

21  	The plaintiff is a relatively young man who has suffered a
serious permanent injury which materially deteriorated in 1998.
 He had been in
regular employment prior to the accident but since the accident he has been
unable to work and cannot attend to normal
domestic tasks.  He is unlikely to
work in the future.  If the plaintiff is successful in his claim he would be
entitled to a substantial
award of damages.  The defendant did not adduce
evidence of actual prejudice.  The accident occurred in 1995.  The plaintiff
has
been paid workers compensation to date and there have been workers
compensation proceedings.  He has been continually assessed by
the defendant's
doctors since the accident occurred.  There may be some presumptive
prejudice.
<P>

22  	After taking into account all of these matters I am not
satisfied that the chances of the defendant obtaining a fair trial
is unlikely.
Nor am I satisfied that the defendant will suffer significant prejudice.  The
plaintiff has discharged his onus and
satisfied me that it is just and
reasonable to grant leave to commence proceedings.  
<P>

23  	Costs are discretionary.   The factor that gave rise to this
application is the plaintiff's unexpected deterioration of his
back condition
in 1998.  The defendant opposed the orders sought.  It is my view that the
appropriate order for costs is that costs
be cost in the cause.
<P>

24  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Leave is granted to revoke the election made in February 1996.
<P>

(2)	Leave is granted to the plaintiff to commence proceedings for damages in
respect of an accident which occurred on 13 January
1995 within 14 days.
<P>

(3)	Costs be costs in the cause.
<P>
