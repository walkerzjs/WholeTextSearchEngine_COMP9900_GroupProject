No. 10940 of 1997
<P>

GREG JAMES, J.
<P>

FRIDAY 30 APRIL 1999
<P>

<center><b>COMMONWEALTH DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC</b>
<P>

<b>PROSECUTIONS v. FRANK ROBERT WEBB &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	In consequence of the views I expressed yesterday in the judgment I gave on
the preliminary question on the application by the
first and second defendants
for extension of time, the parties have appeared this morning, and I have
entertained short submissions
as to the form of the appropriate relief.
<P>

2	It is accepted by both parties that consistent with the views I expressed
yesterday the application should be dismissed.  Further,
it is accepted that
because of the basis for that dismissal, that is the finding as to when the
relevant conviction occurred, it
is accepted by both parties that it is
appropriate, and would logically follow that the Director should have a
declaration in his
favour in the terms set out in the short minutes filed by
the Director, initialled by me, and placed with the papers.
<P>

3	I therefore dismiss the application for extension of time, and make the
declaration set out in the short minutes.  I reserve the
costs and reserve to
the parties liberty to apply in respect of the matter of costs on one week's
notice.
<P>

4	I cannot depart, however, from these proceedings without observing that if
the effect of the procedures in the criminal courts
in New South Wales are such
as to make it necessary to embark on an enquiry into obscure facts and
implications to enable the ascertainment
of when such an important matter as a
conviction occurred, for the purposes of ascertaining the rights of third
parties to retain
their own property, then it is necessary, at least because of
the draconic effects that may occur under proceeds of crime legislation,
for
those procedures to be reconsidered so that all who deal in property might know
whether it might be so adversely affected as
to defeat legitimate
expectations.
<P>

5	I will direct a copy of these remarks be taken out and forwarded with my
judgment to the enquiry which, I understand, is now proceeding
by the
Australian Law Reform Commission.  And further, that a copy of these remarks
and the judgment be provided to the New South
Wales Law Reform Commission and
the Attorney-General's Criminal Law Review Division so that they might give
consideration to procedures
for the formal entry of a conviction, the
pronouncement in some definite, easily ascertained form of the record of the
conviction
such as would make clear in this State as it is in others when a
conviction occurs as a matter of fact and law.
<P>
