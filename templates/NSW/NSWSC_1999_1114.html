<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>No.  12914 of 1997</b>
<P>

<b>WOOD CJ at CL</b>
<P>

<b>TUESDAY 9 NOVEMBER 1999</b>
<P>

<center><b><u>THE PROTHONOTARY v WILSON</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  Some material has been placed before me on
behalf of the defendant concerning his prior character; for example,
it has
been shown that he has no prior convictions of any kind, he has been a
practising dentist and a friend of his, Ray Lovett,
says that he regards him as
a truthful man who does help people in the community, and who has a genuine
belief in the injustices
of the legal system. Beyond that, no material has been
placed before me as to the general character of the defendant or concerning
his
mental state.
<P>

2   	It may be accepted that it is of the nature of matters that
come before the courts in this State that often strong passions
will be raised
and that, in some litigants, feelings of injustice will be engendered. In some
situations those feelings may be genuine,
in others, although strongly held
those beliefs will be baseless. 
<P>

3   	In dealing with the matter of contempt the court is not
concerned with the rightness or wrongness of the complaints which the
defendant
has in relation to the justice system, save to accept, as I do, that such
beliefs as he expresses are firmly held by him.

<P>

4   	The relevant approach was identified by Kirby ACJ in
<b><i>Cook &amp; Ors v. Phillips</i></b>, Court of Appeal, 29 September 1995,
unreported, when his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"Unless this Court by its orders in cases such as this controls such
passions in the environment of the court room and the precincts
of the court,
the achievement of peaceful curial resolution of disputes will be frustrated
and may, in a particular case, be prevented.
This civilised feature of our
society could then give way to verbal abuse, physical assault and even
worse."</i>
<P>

5   	It is on the basis of principles such as this, that both
personal and general deterrence loom large. 
<P>

6   	In the same case, Mahoney AP said:
<P>

<i>"It is important to make clear, to those who take part in proceedings before
the Court and to those who associate themselves with
such proceedings, that
there must not be any improper interference with the course of justice"</i>
<P>

7   	To similar effect were the observations of Gleeson CJ in
<b><i>Her Majesty's Attorney General in and for the State of New South Wales. v
Hayden</i></b>, 23 November 1994, unreported, when his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"Elements of both general and personal deterrence are important in the
present case. The need for personal deterrence is evident from
the history of
the opponent. In relation to the issue of general deterrence I would adopt and
repeat the observations made by Priestley
JA in the case of <b>European Asia
Bank AG v Wentworth</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSW%20LR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSW LR 445</a> at 463 where his Honour said: 'It
seems to me that courts must do everything reasonably possible to protect the
integrity of their
own processes, including the safety of persons lawfully
present upon court precincts in connection with litigation'."</i>
<P>

8   	The present offences I regard as most serious and to be
such that the only proper outcome is a sentence of imprisonment. The
purpose of
such a sentence is both to punish the defendant for the serious incidents of
contempt of which he has been convicted,
to provide him with an encouragement
towards rehabilitation, to deter him and others from similar conduct, and to
mark the community
disapproval of the offences.
<P>

9   	Taking those matters into account, and bearing in mind the
circumstance previously noted that this was a case of premeditation
rather than
a spontaneous outburst, I sentence the prisoner in relation to each count to a
fixed term of imprisonment of two years
each to commence from today.
