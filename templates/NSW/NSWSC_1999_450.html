<b>2400/97	YUSEN DALY SMITH INTERNATIONAL PTY LIMITED (IN LIQ) &amp; ANOR v
THOMAS EDWIN CURTIS SMITH &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1	These proceedings arise from transactions which have already been the subject
of extensive litigation.  The course of that litigation
will appear
hereafter.
<P>

<b>The Factual Background and History of the Litigation</b>
<P>

2	In the first half of 1989 the first defendant, Mr T E C Smith ("Smith"), and
a Mr Daly ("Daly") were directors and equal shareholders
in Daly Smith
Corporation Pty Limited ("DSC") which conducted a warehousing and transport
business.  That company subsequently had
its name changed to Thanyule Pty
Limited ("Thanyule").  They were also associated in other companies.  Those
companies included Daly
Smith (Management Services) Pty Limited ("Management
Services") and Daly Smith Corporation (Australia) Pty Limited ("DSC
Australia").
 Negotiations took place between DSC and a Japanese shipping
company, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha ("NYK") for a joint venture.
 Yusen Daly
Smith International Pty Limited ("YDSI"), now in liquidation, became the
vehicle for that joint venture and purchased
DSC's business from it for the sum
of $3.8 million.  The $3.8 million was borrowed by YDSI from the Australia and
New Zealand Banking
Group Limited ("the ANZ").  The $3.8 million was drawn down
and the purchase price of the business paid on 5 July 1989.  Later in
the year
YDSI sought overdraft facilities from the ANZ and, as a condition of being
granted those facilities, on 23 October 1989
executed a mortgage debenture
("the mortgage debenture") in favour of the ANZ.
<P>

3	The mortgage debenture was registered on 28 November 1989 and numbered 43368.
It charged all of YDSI's undertaking and assets
with the payment of "the moneys
hereby secured".  "The moneys hereby secured" are defined on the first page of
the mortgage debenture
as the moneys in certain categories.  The categories are
not numbered in the mortgage debenture but when quoted below are given
paragraph
numbers in round brackets and sub paragraph numbers in Roman numerals
for ease of reference.  "The moneys hereby secured" include
the following:
<P>

"(2)	ALL MONEYS which the Bank ... has paid or become liable to pay or which
the Bank shall pay or become liable to pay for or on
account of the mortgagor
... and either by direct advances or by reason of accepting or paying or
discounting any order draft cheque
promissory note Bill of Exchange or other
engagement ... or otherwise incurring liabilities for or on behalf of the
mortgagor ...
<P>

  (4)	ALSO ALL moneys costs (as between Solicitor and own client) charges and
expenses which the Bank shall pay or become liable
to pay in or incidental to
[i] preparing completing stamping or registering these presents or [ii] to
investigating or perfecting
or defending the title to the mortgaged premises or
[iii] exercising or attempting to exercise any right or remedy of the Bank
hereunder
or of any such demand as aforesaid or [iv] on account of or arising
out of any default by the Mortgagor in duly performing or observing
any of the
covenants or agreements on the part of the Mortgagor contained or implied
herein or in any other security over the mortgaged
premises or any part
thereof.
<P>

  (5)	ALSO ALL moneys payable or to become payable for discounts postages
commissions charges exchanges re-exchanges and other lawful
and accustomed
charges and expenses according to the usage and course of business of the
Bank."
<P>

The mortgage debenture further provides as follows:
<P>

"1	The Mortgagor will on demand duly pay to the Bank the moneys hereby
secured.
<P>

...
<P>

12	All moneys which the Bank may pay or expend under any power or authority
herein contained or implied or in consequence of any
default that may be made
by the Mortgagor in the performance or observance of any covenant or condition
of these presents and all
costs (including costs as between Solicitor and own
client) charges and expenses already or hereafter incurred by the Bank ... for
the purpose of giving effect to the security created by these presents ...
shall be moneys hereby secured as aforesaid ...
<P>

...
<P>

18	The moneys hereby secured shall at the option of the Bank (notwithstanding
anything hereinbefore contained) immediately become
due and payable and the
security hereby created shall immediately become enforceable without the
necessity for any demand or notice
... upon the happening of any one or more of
the following events:
<P>

(a)	if a petition is presented or an order is made or an effective resolution
is passed for the winding up of the Mortgagor ...
<P>

...
<P>

41	And except to the extent that such interpretation shall be excluded by or be
repugnant to the context whenever the same is used
herein the word `Mortgagor'
shall be deemed to mean and include the Mortgagor and its assigns the word
`Bank' shall be deemed to
mean and include the Bank and its assigns ..."
<P>

4	Part of the security provided by YDSI for the borrowing of $3.8 million was a
bank guarantee procured to be given by the ANZ in
favour of the Bank of Tokyo
Australia Limited ("BOT") in the sum of $2.65 million.  In respect of this a
guarantee was given to the
ANZ by DSC.
<P>

5	In 1994 there was a parting of the ways between Smith and Daly.  The form
which this took was that Smith bought all of Daly's
shareholdings in the Daly
Smith group of companies (save that in some cases Daly retained one share to
provide a second shareholder
for a company).  At that time, the DSC guarantee
to support the bank guarantee to the BOT for $2.65 million was replaced by two
individual
guarantees of $1.325 million given to the ANZ by each of Daly and
Smith.  At the same time the $2.65 million bank guarantee by the
ANZ to BOT was
replaced by two individual bank guarantees, each of $1.325 million and
supported by the guarantee of one of the two
shareholders.   The letter of
offer to Smith to this effect dated 9 March 1994 and the bank guarantee
guaranteed by him and executed
on 22 April 1994 were part of the confused
concatenation of documents which was central to the Court of Appeal's decision
referred
to below, and which was again relied on before me.  On 6 October 1994
BOT made demand on the ANZ for $1.325 million under the bank
guarantee
supported by Smith's guarantee and was paid on the same day.  On that day the
ANZ debited the sum of $1.325 million to
an account of Smith.
<P>

6	In October 1994 Smith commenced proceedings 4058/94 against YDSI, NYK and
another, claiming the payment of the $1.325 million
with which he had been
debited by the ANZ and "the amount of the guarantees [sic] fees outlaid by Mr
Smith for the provision of the
ANZ ... guarantees", or, alternatively, the
winding up of YDSI under the Corporations Law s 260 (now s 246AA) or s 461.  On
13 March
1995 Young J made an order in those proceedings for the winding up of
the company by consent.
<P>

7	On 10 April 1995 Smith commenced proceedings 1913/95 in this Division.  By
his amended statement of claim he sued the ANZ as first
defendant and YDSI as
third defendant.  After alleging the transactions referred to above he made the
following charges of law and
claims:
<P>

"10	In the premises:
<P>

a)	the plaintiff is entitled to be subrogated to the rights which the first
defendant had against the third defendant and its property
including the first
defendant's entitlement to recover the amount of $1,325,000.00 <b>and interest,
charges, expenses and costs</b> as moneys owed under the aforesaid Registered
Charge out of the third defendant's undertaking and property;
<P>

b)	the first defendant is obliged to assign the Charge to the plaintiff or
alternatively, is obliged to lend its name to any proceedings
for recovery of
the aforesaid moneys by the plaintiff against the third defendant;
<P>

c)	the second defendant is obliged to pay the aforesaid moneys to the plaintiff
on demand in satisfaction of the third defendant's
liability aforesaid to the
plaintiff.
<P>

11	The plaintiff claims accordingly:
<P>

(1)	Declarations or a declaration as the case may require that in the events
which have happened:
<P>

a)	the first defendant is a secured creditor of the third defendant under
Registered Charge No 43368 over the undertaking and assets
of the third
defendant for the whole of the amount of $1,325,000 paid out by it on 6 October
1994 to Bank of Tokyo Australia Limited
for and on behalf of the third
defendant <b>and interest</b> thereon at the first defendant's applicable rate
or rates from time to time<b> charges, expenses and costs</b>; and
<P>

b)	the first defendant is entitled to call for payment in full of the said
amount of $1,325,000 <b>and interest, charges, expenses and costs</b> from the
assets of the third defendant in the control of the second defendant; or
<P>

c)	alternatively, on 6 October, 1994, the plaintiff became entitled to be
subrogated to the first defendant's rights with respect
to the first
defendant's registered Charge No 43368 and thereby entitled to call for payment
in full of the aforesaid amount of $1,325,000
<b>and any interest, charges,
expenses and costs charged thereon</b> by the first defendant in priority to
all and any other debts, charges, costs and expenses of the third defendant"
[emphasis added].
<P>

8	When the proceedings came on for trial before Young J on 1 May 1995 the ANZ
in effect announced by counsel that it would submit
to the orders of the Court.
The next day it announced by its solicitor that it did not seek an order for
costs, stating that it was
entitled to its costs under the mortgage debenture.
In his judgment delivered on 16 June 1995 his Honour formulated four questions
as necessary to be answered in order for him to decide the issues before him.
Of those questions, relevant to the matter now in hand
are the first two, which
were as follows:
<P>

"1	Was the guarantee given by Mr Smith given on his own behalf or on behalf of
YDSI?
<P>

  2	What was the status of the charge given by the third defendant at the time
of payment of the ANZ Bank's debt?"
<P>

His Honour's answer to question 1 was that Smith paid the ANZ as a surety and
was entitled to be subrogated to whatever securities
the ANZ had, but, to the
second question, his Honour answered that the securities held by the ANZ were
not available to Smith under
the doctrine of subrogation.
<P>

9	Smith appealed to the Court of Appeal.  The appeal was numbered CA 40392/95.
It was heard on 30 November 1995 before Kirby P and
Priestley and Sheller JJA.
Judgment was delivered on 5 February 1996.  That judgment was subsequently
withdrawn, and the appeal was
further heard on 4 March 1996 before Priestley,
Sheller and Powell JJA.  The judgment finally disposing of it was delivered on
21
November 1996.  Before the second hearing, draft orders, which the appellant
asked the Court of Appeal to make if his appeal were
successful, had been
lodged with the Court of Appeal.  The draft orders were lodged about 16
February 1996 and were in the following
form:
<P>

"AND THE COURT DECLARES THAT:
<P>

3	Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ACN 005 357 522) (`ANZ') is
a secured creditor of Yusen Daley [sic] Smith International
Pty Limited (In
Liquidation) (`the company') under Registered Charge No. 43368 over the
undertaking and assets of the company for
the whole of the amount of
$1,325,000.00 paid out by ANZ on 6 October 1994 to Bank of Tokyo Australia
Limited for and on behalf of
the company and all moneys, costs, charges,
expenses and interest in or incidental thereto as are secured under the charge
<b>including costs</b> <b>incurred by ANZ in proceedings in the Equity Division
1913 of 1995 and these proceedings</b>.
<P>

4	Thomas Edwin Curtis Smith has the benefit of ANZ's rights under the said
Registered Charge in respect of the said amount of $1,325,000.00
<b>and moneys,
costs, charges, expenses and interest </b>and ANZ's remedies for enforcing
payment thereof.
<P>

AND THE COURT FURTHER ORDERS THAT:
<P>

...
<P>

7	The appellant has liberty to apply to a judge of the Court with respect to
the quantification of the said moneys, costs, charges,
expenses and interest"
[emphasis added].
<P>

Written submissions were made by counsel on both sides concerning the form of
these orders.  It would seem those submissions were
lodged after the hearing on
4 March 1996.  The submissions on behalf of YDSI are undated; the submissions
on behalf of the appellant
are dated 11 March 1996.  Uncertain from their form
is the order in which the respective submissions were prepared; perhaps it is
more likely that YDSI's were prepared as a response to the form of orders, and
that Smith's were prepared in reply to YDSI's; but
it probably does not matter.
YDSI's submissions contained the following:
<P>

"1	The second and third respondents submit that the last six lines should be
deleted from proposed order 3 if the appellant's case
on subrogation is
otherwise accepted.
<P>

  2	Proposed order 3 should also be amended:
<P>

a)	by deleting `is' from the second line and substituting `would have been'
and,
<P>

b)	adding after `for and on behalf of the company', the words `if it had not
been paid the said amount by Thomas Edwin Curtis Smith'.
<P>

  3	It is also submitted that the words afer `$1,325,000.00' should be omitted
from proposed order 4 if the appellant's case on
subrogation is otherwise
upheld.
<P>

  4	As to proposed order 3 -
<P>

a)	The last six lines should be deleted because this is a matter on which the
ANZ bank [sic], though a party, has made no such application;
<P>

b)	It is not conceded that any such claims by ANZ (if and when made) would be
secured under the charge.  The portion of the draft
Order asserting security
for ANZ's costs under the mortgage does not correctly reflect the effect of the
relevant provisions of the
Mortgage Debenture:  AB 98 S-U.  Such claims are
relevantly secured only in so far as they are liabilities or payments of the
bank
in or incidental to investigating, perfecting or defending the title to
the mortgaged premises.
<P>

  5	As to proposed order 4:
<P>

a)	The effect of this declaration would be to furnish to Mr Smith rights and
remedies beyond those which were or would have been
available to ANZ.  The
contentious words enable the appellant to `tack' his own claims for costs and
expenses into ANZ's security.
 This goes beyond the appellant's rights of
subrogation:  <b>Sydney Turf Club v. Crowley</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20NSWLR%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] NSWLR 724</a> at 734, per
Mason, J [sic].
<P>

b)	It is submitted that on the true construction of the mortgage debenture, the
clauses relating to the bank's costs, charges, expenses
and interest do not
extend to include costs, charges, expenses and interest claims of the
appellant.
<P>

c)	For example, the effect of the declaration would be that the appellant would
become entitled to costs as between solicitor and
own client under the mortgage
(AB 98S-T) and to appoint receivers to recover the same, whereas the mortgage
provides for those claims
to be limited to those which the bank shall pay or
become liable to pay, for certain limited purposes, as noted above."
<P>

Smith's submissions contained the following:
<P>

"1	The orders sought by the appellant, it is submitted, are perfectly
appropriate in a case such as the present.
<P>

2	The appellant would accept, however, that in proposed Order 3 the words in
the last four lines `including...these proceedings'
could be omitted.  Once
those words were omitted, there could be no objection to the form of order.  It
simply reflected the terms
of the charge.  The appellant does not, of course,
concede that it is not entitled to an order in the form originally sought.
<P>

3	If the appellant is successful, ANZ is a secured creditor.
<P>

4	Proposed Order 4 simply relects the effect of subrogation.  The appellant
seeks no more than ANZ's rights.
<P>

5	The orders sought are within the ambit of the claims made in the action (AB
3K-U)."
<P>

10	By its judgment of 21 November 1996, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.
It found that Young J's answer to question 1 was
correct but that his Honour's
answer to question 2 was not correct, and that the correct conclusion was that
Smith was subrogated
to the ANZ's right as a secured creditor of YDSI in regard
to the ANZ's payment of $1.325 million to BOT.  In view of certain of
the
submissions put before me, it is important to bear in mind what was said by
Priestley JA in affirming Young J's decision on question
1:
<P>

"In the end, counsel agreed that the critical issue was whether, on the one
hand, it was right to say that Mr Smith did not do what
he did on behalf of or
at the request of YDSI, or, whether, on the other hand, it would be right for
the court to infer that Mr Smith
(in the shoes of DSC) committed himself to his
1994 document either on behalf of or at the request of YDSI.
<P>

In making the submission that the former was the correct view to take, counsel
for the respondents emphasised the form taken by
the documentation which he
said was inconsistent with and prevented any inference that either DSC's July
1989 document or Mr Smith's
1994 document was given for, or on behalf of, or at
the request of YDSI.
<P>

There are two reasons why I do not accept this submission.  The first is that
in my opinion, on the facts as stated, taking into
account the documents, and
in particular taking into account the form of bank guarantee set out at p4 of
these reasons, the only
reasonable inference is that first DSC and next Mr Daly
and Mr Smith did what they did on behalf of YDSI and in respect of YDSI's
indebtedness.
<P>

The second reason is that acceptance of the respondents' submission would, it
seems to me, mean that Mr Smith had no recourse against
YDSI upon ANZ obtaining
payment from him of the $1.325 million when it debited that amount against his
account.  There are two aspects
of this consequence.  One is that it does not
seem to me to be open to the respondents at this stage of the appeal to rely on
an
argument having that effect.  That is because both before Young J and in the
argument before this court last year, the principal
question in the case was
presented as being whether the amount owed by YDSI to Mr Smith, the fact of
indebtedness being common ground,
was an unsecured or secured debt in the
winding up of YDSI.  The question was whether the debt was a secured debt by
subrogation
or whether, there being no entitlement to subrogation, it was
unsecured.  It was because that was treated as the principal issue
that
attention focused on the position of the mortgage debenture given by YDSI to
ANZ, whether it was still on foot at the relevant
time, and what its proper
construction was.
<P>

It seems likely to me that the fact that no question was raised about the
indebtedness of YDSI to Mr Smith reflected the view then
taken by the
respondents' legal advisers that that was the position which coordinately
involves the idea that Mr Smith's document
of 1994 committing himself to ANZ
was one by which he undertook a commitment for or on behalf of YDSI.  As I have
already indicated,
I think that such a view was correct.
<P>

In any event, however, it seems to me too late for that matter to be
investigated at this stage of the appeal, having been common
ground and the
parties having conducted their cases on that basis for so long.
<P>

In my view, therefore, what became the principal substantive submission (in the
second argument in this court) fails."
<P>

In making its orders the Court of Appeal omitted from the draft orders
submitted on behalf of Smith the words that appear in bold
in the draft orders
set out in [9] above.  All that was said in the reasons given by the Court of
Appeal concerning the form of the
orders was the following in the judgment of
Priestley JA:
<P>

"There was some discussion of the orders that would be made if the court came
to the conclusions I have reached on questions 1 and
2.  Each side put in a
written submission as to the appropriate form.  In the result I propose that
the final orders of this court
on the appeal should be:
<P>

1	Appeal upheld.
<P>

2	The orders made by Young J in the Equity Division of the  Supreme Court on 16
June 1995 be set aside.
<P>

3	Declare that
<P>

(i)	Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ACN 005 357 522) (`ANZ')
was at relevant times a secured creditor of Yusen
Daley [sic] Smith
International Pty Limited (In Liquidation) (`the company') under Registered
Charge No 43368 over the undertaking
and assets of the company for the whole of
the amount of $1,325,000.00 paid out by ANZ on 6 October 1994 to Bank of Tokyo
Australia
Limited for and on behalf of the company and all moneys, costs,
charges, expenses and interest in or incidental thereto as are secured
under
the charge.
<P>

(ii)	Thomas Edwin Curtis Smith has the benefit of ANZ's rights under the said
Registered Charge in respect of the said amount of
$1,325,000.00, and ANZ's
remedies for enforcing payment thereof.
<P>

...
<P>

6	Liberty to any party to apply to a judge of the Court with respect to the
quantification of the said moneys, costs, charges, expenses
and interest."
<P>

11	On 24 December 1996 the ANZ by deed assigned to Smith "all its right title
and interest in and under" the mortgage debenture
("the 1996 assignment").  The
consideration for the 1996 assignment was stated in the deed to be $1.325m.
Smith required the payment
to him by YDSI by 28 April 1997 of the $27,787.88
the subject of claim (2) in [16] below.  On 8 May 1997, Smith, purporting to
act
under the 1996 assignment, appointed John D Green ("Green") receiver under
the mortgage debenture.  In May and June 1997 the litigation
was reactivated in
two ways.  Various motions were filed in 1913/95, the proceedings which had
been to the Court of Appeal.  The
motion most relevant to the present
proceedings was a "cross motion" of Smith ("the cross motion") seeking,
pursuant to the reservation
of liberty in the Court of Appeal, a direction as
to whether he was a secured creditor under the mortgage debenture in respect of
any of four items lettered (a) to (d) as set out below:
<P>

<P>

The cross motion was before me at the end of June 1997, as was also an amended
summons in these proceedings.  They had been commenced
on 13 May 1997 by YDSI
taking out a summons against Smith and Green seeking to restrain Green from
acting as receiver.  By amendment,
the summons sought declaratory relief
generally to the effect that Smith had no rights under the mortgage debenture.
After some delay
relating to the availability of counsel, the cross motion was
fixed for hearing before me on 3 November 1997.  The amended summons
in these
proceedings was also listed before me on that day, not for hearing, but simply
to keep the matters together.
<P>

12	On 28 October 1997 in the duty list an application for an injunction was
made to Young J relating to the disbursement of moneys
by the liquidator of
YDSI.  His Honour refused to grant any relief.  In delivering reasons for his
judgment upon that application,
his Honour said, relevantly to the course of
proceedings now under consideration:
<P>

"The Court of Appeal's declaration 3(ii) as to Mr Smith's rights, when read
literally said that Mr Smith's rights are limited to
an amount of money which
has already been paid. Thus its rights on that construction would now be
exhausted however, it is hard to
see, if that is the proper construction, what
order 6 made by the Court of Appeal could possibly mean.  Possibly it was made
to refer
to the ANZ Bank alone.  If there is any problem about the Court of
Appeal's order, that should be raised on a motion before the Court
of Appeal
rather than as a matter raised on a side wind before a single judge."
<P>

13	When the the cross motion came before me on 3 November 1997, the whole day
was taken up by argument as to what course the proceedings
should follow, and
whether they should be adjourned from that day.  It was said on Smith's behalf
that he desired to make application
to the Court of Appeal for it to determine
the interpretation of its orders and, if appropriate, to modify or extend the
terms of
its referral to a single Judge.  Sharing as I did Young J's view as to
the appropriate forum for interpretation of the Court of Appeal's
order, I
acceded to that application, for reasons which I gave at the time.
<P>

14	A motion was then brought in the Court of Appeal, which listed in a schedule
the four items (a) to (d) as follows: 
<P>

"(a)  ANZ Bank Guarantee fees totalling $87,229.06 charged to Thanyule Pty
Limited and Daly Smith (Management Services) Pty Limited
by ANZ in respect of
the guarantees provided by ANZ for the third defendant.
<P>

(b)  Legal costs assessed on the solicitor/client basis incurred by the
plaintiff in the following matters-
<P>

(i) ED 4058/94;
<P>

(ii) ED 1913/95
<P>

(iii) CA 40392/95;
<P>

HC S12 OR 1006;
<P>

(c)  Legal fees incurred by ANZ Bank in proceedings No 1913/95 and debited to
YDSI Pty Ltd as a secured debt subject to Mortgage
Debenture registered No
43368.
<P>

(d)  Capitalised periodical interest additional to the principal sum of
$1,325,000.00."
<P>

These are substantially identical with those in the cross motion, set out in
[11] above, with one significant difference.  That
is, that the earlier item
(c) was replaced by one totally different.  The motion asked for a
determination whether the four items
could be said "to fall within the terms of
the said declarations 3(i) and 3(ii) and Order 6" of the Court of Appeal's
orders.  This
motion was heard and determined by Meagher JA on 24 November
1997.  His Honour said:
<P>

"It is as clear as can be that the amounts listed in the schedule do not come
within the terms of Court of Appeal order 3(i) and
Mr Neil QC, learned senior
counsel for the claimant did not claim that they did.  It is however claimed
with some vigour that they
come within the provisions of orders 3(ii) [sic].
Mr Street of senior counsel for the opponents claimed the contrary.
<P>

I am afraid I am convinced by what Mr Street said that none of the four items
in the schedule come within order 3(ii), and am also
convinced that order 6 of
the Court of Appeal's orders does not progress the claimants [sic] entitlement
to the order he seeks in
the present motion.
<P>

Merely by way of example if one looks at the first item in the schedule it is
in the following terms.  `ANZ bank guarantee fees,
totalling $87,229.06 charged
to Thanyule Pty [sic] and Daly Smith (Management Services) Pty Ltd by ANZ in
respect of guarantees provided
by ANZ for the third defendant.'  It is not
clear whether anyone has paid the amount of $87,229.06.  In particular it is
not clear,
that Mr Smith has done so.  What is more to point is that Thanyule
Pty Ltd and Daly Smith who are the alleged debtors in relation
to these
accounts are not parties in this litigation and do not seem to have anything to
do with it.  The amount has not been paid
by and there is no liability that it
should be paid by Thanyule Daly Smith International Pty Ltd [sic] the company
in liquidation
and the company referred to in the Court of Appeal orders.
Likewise if one dissects each of the other three heads in the schedule
one
comes, perhaps reluctantly to the conclusion, that none of them are within the
terms of the court of appeal orders.
<P>

For those reasons I would suggest that the notice of motion be dismissed with
costs because the declarations sought in par 2 of
that notice of motion
manifestly have no validity."
<P>

15	Thereafter Smith did not persist in his prosecution of the cross motion.  On
13 January 1998 Management Services executed a deed
of assignment ("the 1998
assignment"). <b> </b>The 1998 assignment listed in a schedule 14 monthly
payments made by Management Services to the ANZ, the first on 3 September 1993,
the last on 30 September 1994.  The total amount was $51,895.78.  The amount
paid prior to April 1994 was $35,333.28 and the amount
paid after April 1994
was $16,562.50.  The deed recited that the payments were made "for and on
behalf of YDSI on account of" the
bank guarantee fees and that the "liability
to pay the fee was a secured liability under the terms of" the mortgage
debenture.  No
consideration was stated in the deed.  By the 1998 assignment
Management Services assigned to Smith "all its right title and interest
in and
under" the mortgage debenture.  On 3 February 1998 Smith filed in these
proceedings a cross claim in pleading form claiming
declaratory relief,
relevantly as set out in [16] below.  I drew attention, late in the trial, to
the fact that the original cross
claim did not appear to accord with the case
as argued.  Smith has now propounded an amended cross claim, which it is said
accurately
reflects his case as argued.  Leave has not yet formally been
granted for the amendment, although both parties have put their final
submissions by reference to the document, and YDSI has indicated that there is
no objection to the amendment being made.  On 16 February
1998 the plaintiffs
as cross defendants filed a defence to the original cross claim containing
traverses, but also pleading substantive
defences by way of <i>res judicata</i>
and estoppel arising out of the decision in 1913/95 (including its
determination on appeal).  The cross defendants state that they
do not need to
amend their defence by reason of the proposed amendment of the cross claim.
<P>

<b>The Present Claims</b>
<P>

16	It is the defendant and cross claimant who is the proponent of the
substantive claims in these proceedings; by the amended cross
claim he claims
declarations that items in three categories are secured in his favour by the
mortgage debenture, so that he is entitled
to enforce that security in respect
of them.  Those three claims have a general correspondence with items (a) to
(c) raised before
Meagher JA.  YDSI's claim, made by the amended summons, is
that there should be a declaration that none of Smith's claims is so secured
and, consequentially, a declaration that Green's appointment as receiver was
invalid, since there was no debt at the time of the
appointment to found it.
The cross claimant's three claims, as finally propounded, were that the
following moneys should be declared
to be secured under the mortgage debenture
and were recoverable by Smith from YDSI:
<P>

(1)	Under par 55(a)(v) and (vi) of the amended cross claim, costs incurred by
or ordered in favour of Smith in proceedings 4058/94
and 40392/95.  This
corresponds with item (b) in the cross motion and in the Court of Appeal
motion.
<P>

(2)	Under par 55(a)(iv) of the amended cross claim, $27,787.88, alleged to have
been "owed to ANZ by YDSI that was paid to ANZ by
the Cross-claimant on 24
December 1996".  The facts relating to this claim are somewhat convoluted, and
are set out in more detail
in [21] below.  This claim corresponds with item (c)
in the cross motion and in the Court of Appeal motion.
<P>

(3)	Under par 55(a)(ii) and (iii) of the amended cross claim, $51,895.78 in
respect of the bank guarantee fees specified in the
1998 assignment.  They are
claimed under the general law, as paid in respect of the bank guarantee which
was counter guaranteed by
Smith, and paid by him to the ANZ under the
guarantee.  This corresponds with item (a) in the cross motion and in the Court
of Appeal
motion, which was in the sum of $87,229.06, but the balance over
$51,895.78 has been abandoned.
<P>

As already noted, no claim corresponding with item (d) in the cross motion and
in the Court of Appeal motion is made in these proceedings.
 As I understand
it, each claim is said to be made under the general law of subrogation and
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1965404/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1965404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965</a> ("the LRMP
Act").  Claim 3 is also made under the 1998 assignment.  In the very confused
state of these proceedings, despite earnest
rereadings of the material, I
remain unclear as to whether the claim to the $27,787.88 was or was not made
under the 1996 assignment.
 I elaborate in [28] below.  The assignments, of
course, did not exist at the time of the earlier proceedings, including the
Court
of Appeal motion before Meagher JA.
<P>

<b>The Law:  Subrogation</b>
<P>

17	When the principal debt has been paid off, a guarantor who has paid the
whole or part of it is entitled to be subrogated to the
rights of the creditor
in respect of the debt and to stand in the shoes of the creditor for the
purpose of enforcing any security
which the creditor held prior to the payment
of the debt:  see <b>Australasian Conference Association Ltd v Mainline

Surety </i>(4th Ed, 1982) 134; O'Donovan, <i>The Modern Contract of Guarantee
</i>(3rd Ed, 1996) 653.  In addition there is in force in New South Wales s 3
of the LRMP Act (originally the Mercantile Law Amendment
Act 1856 (Imp) s 5),
as follows:
<P>

"3	(1)	A person who, being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being
liable with another for a debt or duty, pays that debt,
or performs that duty,
is entitled:
<P>

(a)	to have assigned to that person, or to a trustee for that person, every
judgment, specialty or other security held by the creditor
in respect of that
debt or duty, whether or not that judgment, specialty or other security is
taken at law to have been satisfied
by the payment of the debt or the
performance of the duty; and
<P>

(b)	to stand in the place of the creditor and to use all the remedies, and, if
necessary, and on a proper indemnity, to use the
name of the creditor in any
proceedings to obtain from the principal debtor or any co-surety, co-contractor
or co-debtor (as the
case requires) indemnity for the advances made and loss
sustained by the person who paid the debt or performed the duty.
<P>

(2)	The payment of the debt or the performance of the duty by a surety is not a
defence to any such proceedings referred to in subsection
(1).
<P>

(3)	A co-surety, co-contractor or co-debtor is not entitled under this section
to recover from another co-surety, co-contractor
or co-debtor more than the
proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, that person is justly
liable."
<P>

This provision ensures that the security also continues to be available to the
guarantor even if discharged as between the original
parties to it.  However,
the doctrine of subrogation does not give the guarantor any greater rights than
the creditor had, nor can
the guarantor recover more than he has paid as
guarantor:  <i>The Laws of Australia </i>tit Contract [178]; O'Donovan <i>op
cit</i> 666.  This is illustrated by what was said by Mason JA (as his Honour
then was) in <b>Sydney Turf Club v Crowley </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20NSWLR%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 NSWLR 724</a> at 734:
<P>

"Where an insurer is subrogated to the rights of the insured against a third
party, the insured does not acquire an independent
cause of action in his own
right. He succeeds to the insured's cause of action against the third party, in
this case a right of action
on the policy issued by the Jockey Club. That right
of action remains in all respects unaltered; it is brought in the name of the
insured and it is subject to all the defences which would be available if the
action had been brought by the insured for his own
benefit. Thus payment in
full by the Government Insurance Office on account of the risk is a defence to
the action by the appellant
against the Jockey Club and it is no answer to that
defence that the action is brought for the benefit of the insurer."
<P>

And by Gibbs ACJ in the <b>Australasian Conference Association </b>case supra
at 348 - 349:
<P>

"In my opinion the doctrine of subrogation does not assist the Bank in the
circumstances of the present case.  It was said by Lord
Eldon that a right of
subrogation arises by force of `that equity, upon which it is considered
against conscience, that the holder
of the securities should use them to the
prejudice of the surety; and therefore there is nothing hard in the act of the
Court, placing
the surety exactly in the situation of the creditor':
<b>Aldrich v Cooper</b> 11  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281803%29%208%20Ves%20Jr%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1803) 8 Ves Jun 382</a>, at p 389  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20ER%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[32 ER 402</a>, at p 405]
...  As the statement of Lord Eldon indicates, and as is well settled, a surety
who has paid the debt due to the creditor
is entitled to stand in the
creditor's shoes; he has the creditor's rights, but only those rights ...
[T]he appellant concedes that
it has no right to the surplus of the money ...
and all parties accept this concession as correct. If, therefore, the Bank were
placed
in the shoes of the appellant, it would have no claim by virtue of
subrogation to the surplus of the money, because the appellant
itself has no
right to that surplus.  For these reasons the doctrine of subrogation has no
application to a case such as the present."
<P>

This means that to succeed in a claim such as the present the surety must
establish in respect of any item claimed:  (1) that he
expended a sum in
discharge of his liability as surety; and (2) that there was a liability for
the sum payable to the principal creditor
by the debtor and falling within the
security sought to be enforced.
<P>

<b>The Law:  <i>Res Judicata</i> and Estoppel</b>
<P>

18	The cross defendant relied on <i>res judicata </i>in the strict sense; issue
estoppel, as to which, in this context, see <b>Sandtara Pty Ltd v Abigroup Ltd

"where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication
by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court
requires the parties to that
litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under
special circumstances) permit
the same parties to open the same subject of
litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part
of the
subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they
have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted
part of their
case.  The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to
points upon which the Court was actually
required by the parties to form an
opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to
the subject of
litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable
diligence, might have brought forward at the time."
<P>

Their Honours continued at 602:
<P>

"In this situation we would prefer to say that there will be no estoppel unless
it appears that the matter relied upon as a defence
in the second action was so
relevant to the subject matter of the first action that it would have been
unreasonable not to rely on
it.  Generally speaking, it would be unreasonable
not to plead a defence if, having regard to the nature of the plaintiff's
claim,
and its subject matter it would be expected that the defendant would
raise the defence and thereby enable the relevant issues to
be determined in
the one proceeding.  In this respect, we need to recall that there are a
variety of circumstances, some referred
to in the earlier cases, why a party
may justifiably refrain from litigating an issue in one proceeding yet wish to
litigate the
issue in other proceedings eg expense, importance of the
particular issue, motives extraneous to the actual litigation, to mention
but a
few."
<P>

In short, where the earlier judgment has determined the right or cause of
action, the matter is <i>res judicata</i>; where that is not so, but an issue
has necessarily been decided between the parties in arriving at the earlier
judgment, there will
be an issue estoppel; and where a subject matter was so
closely related to the subject matter of the earlier proceedings that it
ought
reasonably have been raised and determined in those proceedings, there will be
an <i>Anshun </i>estoppel:  see <b>Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life
Association of Australia Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 543</a> at 556 - 558 per Clarke

<b>The Law:  Mortgagees' Costs</b>
<P>

19	I have been referred to various authorities relating to the awarding of
mortgagees' costs in mortgage actions.  In reality, the
issues that arise on
costs in these proceedings are questions of construction of the mortgage
debenture;  the questions are whether
various amounts fall within the paragraph
numbered (4) set out in [3] above.  Essentially, the construction of mortgages
by courts
proceeds on the same principles as the construction of other
documents:  <i>Fisher &amp; Lightwood's Law of Mortgage </i>(Aust Ed by Tyler,
Young &amp; Croft, 1995) [3.7].  Where a mortgage provided for the payment of
the mortgagee's costs on an indemnity
basis, the mortgagee was held entitled to
recover all costs except those unreasonably incurred:  <b>Gomba Holdings (UK)
Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20Ch%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] Ch 171</a> CA.  Although this mortgage
debenture speaks in terms of solicitor and client costs, in my view the result
for present purposes would
be the same.  In general terms, a mortgagee's costs
to be recoverable must be reasonably incurred:  see generally Tyler, Croft
&amp;
Young <i>op cit </i>[40.23].
<P>

<b>The Facts Relating to the Claims:  Costs</b>
<P>

20	This is, in monetary terms, the largest of the claims made.  The costs were
all costs incurred and paid by Smith in relation
to earlier proceedings.  There
is no doubt that Smith paid them.  As I understand it, it is agreed that the
costs paid by Smith on
a solicitor/client basis were $618,000.  Costs ordered
on a party/party basis, as assessed, total $247,000.  The claim that is made
is
in respect of the difference, namely, $371,000, subject to one matter.  That
matter is that the quantum of the assessed costs
is, on the evidence before me,
under challenge by Smith, so that it is possible that the amount of $247,000
paid may at some stage
be increased and the balance of the solicitor/client
costs claimed correspondingly reduced.  So far as relief in these proceedings
is concerned, if there is to be any relevant relief, that situation may be met
by the relief being declaratory at this stage.
<P>

<b>The Facts Relating to the Claims:  The $27,787.88</b>
<P>

21		On 19 May 1995 Gadens Ridgeway, solicitors, sent to the ANZ an account for
professional fees in the sum of $15,419.47 together
with a memorandum of fees
from Mr Arthur Emmett of Queen's Counsel for $8,100 and a memorandum of fees
from Mr RW White of junior
counsel for $3,250.  The ANZ paid the total of these
accounts, being $26,769.47.  Gadens Ridgeway's account was stated to be "Re:
Subpoena by" YDSI.  It is impossible to tell from the accounts what precisely
the work was in respect of.  Despite the description
in the accounts, the work
appears to have been preparation for and appearance at a Court hearing on 1 May
1995, in respect of which
day both counsel charged a brief on hearing fee.
This was the day on which, as noted in [8] above the ANZ announced a submitting
appearance.  Mr M D Hirst, the partner of Gadens Ridgeway who is shown by the
accounts to have done the bulk of the work, deposes
that the appearances were
before Young J and that the "ANZ appeared in the Equity Division proceedings
because it was joined as a
party."  No order for costs was made in its favour.
As again noted in [8], it did not ask for one, saying it would rely on the
mortgage
debenture.  On 24 May 1995 the ANZ wrote to Smith requesting payment
of those legal fees totalling $26,769.47 "in relation to the
recent legal
action undertaken between yourself and" YDSI.  The request was made in
"accordance with our Letter of Offer to yourself
dated 9 March 1994"
(presumably that referred to in [5] above).  The moneys were not paid in answer
to the request.  As late as 13
December 1996 Smith denied in a letter by his
solicitor that these costs fell within the security or were payable by him.
The 1996
assignment was executed on 24 December 1996.  Terese McCowen, Smith's
wife and a director of Management Services and DSC Australia,
on 23 December
1996 drew a cheque to the ANZ for $27,787.88 on DSC Australia which was debited
to that company's account on the same
day.  Despite the difference of this sum
from $26,769.47, the proceedings before me have been conducted on the basis
that the larger
sum represented the ANZ's costs in proceedings 1913/95.  It was
stated on the cheque requisition in Ms McCowen's hand that it was
for (so far
as is legible) "Legal - T Smith".  The amount of the cheque was in DSC
Australia's accounts debited to Smith's loan account.
 On 15 April 1997 the ANZ
wrote to Mr McLaughlin, Smith's solicitor, confirming that Smith paid
$27,787.88 to the ANZ on 24 December
1996 "by way of consideration for the
assignment by us to him of" the mortgage debenture.  Mr McLaughlin
characterised the payment
in the same way in a letter of 17 April 1997, under
cover of which he sent a copy of the ANZ's letter to Blake Dawson Waldron, the
solicitors for YDSI, requesting reimbursement of the sum to Smith.  On the
other hand, in a letter to Blake Dawson Waldron on 24
April 1997 Mr McLaughlin
said that the payment was made because it "was a condition precedent to the
assignment that the debt owing
by YDSI to the bank would be discharged prior to
the assignment".  In his affidavit sworn on 29 May 1997, he deposed that the
moneys
were "paid out to the Bank by Mr Smith as a condition of the assignment
to him by the Bank of the charge".  There does not appear
to be any evidence of
the negotiation as a result of which the 1996 assignment was given. 
<P>

<b>The Facts Relating to the Claims:  The Guarantee Fees</b>
<P>

22	This claim was reduced from $87,000-odd previously claimed to $51,895.78.
There is no dispute that the $51,895.78 was paid as
guarantee fees in respect
of bank guarantees given on behalf of YDSI.  YDSI itself met the bank guarantee
fees (then in respect of
the original bank guarantee of $2.65 million) until
1992.  In that year its bank account was frozen by the ANZ.  Initially, there
was some suggestion in correspondence that the unpaid fees might be met by
directors, but on 23 July 1992 Smith wrote to the ANZ
that "DSC shall have to
shoulder the burden and recover the money from YDSI in due course."  Thereafter
the payments were initially
made by DSC (Thanyule).  On 23 July 1993 a
direction was made that the guarantee fees be debited to the account of
Management Services
rather than that of DSC.  This direction was repeated on 18
August 1993.  There is no dispute that from 3 September 1993 that occurred.
When the original bank guarantee of $2.65 million was in April 1994 divided
into two separate bank guarantees of $1.325 million each,
and the bank
guarantee subsequently drawn down on was issued at the instance of Smith,
Management Services became a co surety with
Smith in respect of that bank
guarantee.  It does not appear to me clear, on the material before me, whether
Management Services
was a surety in respect of the earlier bank guarantee of
$2.65 million, or of the other bank guarantee issued in April 1994 (which
was
guaranteed by Daly), or whether any obligation in respect of the $2.65 million
bank guarantee was secured under a registered
mortgage debenture dated 19 March
1990 which it appears the ANZ held over the fixed and floating assets of
Management Services. 
It is conceded by Mr Neil, of Queen's Counsel for Smith,
that the payments totalling $51,895.78 were made by Management Services,
and
that no debit was made to any loan account of Smith with that company in
respect of those payments.  It is not conceded by YDSI
that the payments were
made in respect of an obligation of YDSI; it is asserted by Mr Street, of
Senior Counsel for YDSI, that there
was a separate agreement between the ANZ
and Management Services under which Management Services was a primary obligee
to pay those
bank guarantee fees, albeit they were in respect of a bank
guarantee of YDSI's obligations.
<P>

<b>Conclusion:  The Costs</b>
<P>

23	By the terms of the amended cross claim the claim in relation to costs
appears to be put on the basis of the general law of subrogation
only.  That
amended cross claim was specifically formulated as the final pleading basis on
which the cross claimant seeks relief
in the circumstances set out in [15]
above.  It is alleged in the amended cross claim that the costs "are moneys
secured under the
Charge aforesaid and recoverable by Smith as equitable
mortgagee by subrogation for and an [sic] account that Smith paid the aforesaid
$1.325 million and such moneys are covered by the terms of the charge as being"
and then portions are set out of the paragraph of
the mortgage debenture
numbered (4) where it appears in [3] above.  This claim does not appear on the
face of the pleading to be
made under s 3 of the LRMP Act or under either of
the assignments.  So far as the general law of subrogation is concerned, it was
conceded by Mr Neil QC that this claim contravened the principle set out in
[17] above, that to be recoverable by subrogation the
debt must have been a
debt owed, in the instant case, by YDSI to the ANZ.  These costs never were in
that category:  they were incurred
by Smith in respect of his conduct of
litigation and were paid by Smith.  It is contended that, nonetheless, they
fall within the
security provided by the mortgage debenture, so far as I can
understand, by reference to its terms, and are recoverable under it.
 In my
opinion this simply is not so.  If s 3 of the LRMP Act were relied on, the
situation would be no different.  Nor could either
of the assignments be
relevant.  In my opinion, these costs are not within the security.
<P>

24	It is not necessary, therefore, for me to determine the defence of estoppel
in relation to this item.  If I did have to determine
it, I should determine
that the defence of estoppel would succeed.  The reasons for which I should do
this are similar to my reasons
given below in [27] in relation to the claim
under the general law of subrogation to the $27,787.88.
<P>

<b>Conclusion:  The $27,787.88</b>
<P>

25	This claim is made in the amended cross claim in the following quite
simplistic terms:
<P>

"47	On 24 December, 1996, by Deed of Assignment made on that day, ANZ assigned
absolutely all its right title and interest in and
under the aforesaid Mortgage
Debenture to Smith.
<P>

48	Immediately before the assignment YDSI owed ANZ an amount of $27,787.88
secured under the Charge.
<P>

49	Smith paid that amount to ANZ on 24 December, 1996.
<P>

50	By reason of such payment Smith became a secured creditor of YDSI by
subrogation entitled to the benefit of the Mortgage Debenture
and to ANZ's
rights and remedies thereunder for recovery of the said amount and interest
loss or damage."
<P>

In my opinion, the central question in relation to this claim, so far as it is
based on the general law of subrogation, or on s
3 of the LRMP Act, is whether
Smith in fact paid the $27,787.88 to the ANZ as a payment made by a surety in
satisfaction of a debt
of YDSI to the ANZ.  This question itself comprehends
three questions:
<P>

1	Whether the $27,787.88 was in fact a debt of YDSI to the ANZ.
<P>

2	Whether the payment was made by Smith.
<P>

3	Whether it was made in his capacity or guise as a surety.
<P>

In seeking relief in respect of this claim Smith bears the onus of establishing
each of these matters.
<P>

26	So far as <b>question 1</b> is concerned, it seems to me that, although the
ANZ was present at those proceedings in a sense only because it was the
original
owner of the security to which subrogation was sought, it would not
have been in the position of having to make that appearance,
were it not for
YDSI's breach of its obligations.  The proceedings arose because YDSI had
breached its obligations under the mortgage
debenture in that it did not pay to
the ANZ the $1.325m paid on its behalf by the ANZ to the BOT; Smith paid the
sum and brought
the proceedings to recover it under the mortgage debenture.
The ANZ was necessarily joined as a party as the mortgagee under the
mortgage
debenture.  The ANZ's actions, in taking advice concerning this complex matter
and then announcing submission to the Court's
orders can hardly be
characterised as unreasonable, nor can the incurring of legal costs in taking
those actions.  In my opinion,
the correct conclusion is that the costs were
incurred by the ANZ "on account of or arising out of any default by the
Mortgagor"
under the mortgage debenture as provided in<i> </i>paragraph (4)
[iv] set out in [3] above.  They were therefore owing and secured to the ANZ
under the mortgage debenture.  So far as
<b>question 2</b> is concerned, the
contending versions were, on the one hand, that the payment was made by Smith
and, on the other hand, that it was
made by DSC Australia.  On the evidence, I
find that the payment was made by Smith.  The cheque was drawn by DSC Australia
on its
acount.  However, the narration in the cheque requisition appears to
indicate that the liability was Smith's, and I accept on the
evidence that the
amount was debited to his loan account with DSC Australia in the relevant year
(the company accounts showing the
movement in the loan account are in evidence,
as is an explanation of the movement).  It was Smith who was taking the
assignment
of the mortgage debenture; the correct characterisation of what
occurred is that the company lent the money to Smith, on whose account
it was
paid to the ANZ at the time of the assignment.  <b>Question 3</b> remains,
whether the $27,787.88 was paid by Smith in discharge of an obligation as
surety of YDSI's obligations, or whether it was
paid by him as the price of the
assignment he desired, in order to bolster his chances in making the claim for
$27,787.88 the subject
of the present litigation.  As in so many instances in
this case, despite the length and complexity of the litigation, the evidence
is
sparse and confused.  That there is not in evidence, either by way of documents
or otherwise, the negotiations or circumstances
immediately surrounding the
making of the payment or the execution and delivery of the assignment
constitutes a difficulty in the
way of Smith's case on this matter.  Certainly,
shortly before the payment was made, Smith was vigorously denying that these
costs
fell, as between the ANZ and YDSI, within the terms of the mortgage
debenture so as to be payable to the ANZ by YDSI.  The evidence
does not
disclose any withdrawal of this denial up to the point of payment.  The only
contemporaneous evidence going to what was
in Smith's mind at the actual time
of payment is Ms McCowen's note on the cheque requisition "Legal - T Smith",
which is quite equivocal
in this regard.  On the evidence the first references
after the payment, on behalf of both the ANZ and Smith, to the payment (in
Smith's case written by lawyers, who are presumably aware of the significance
of the word) characterise the payment as consideration
for the assignment.
There is some suggestion in the correspondence, eg, Mr McLaughlin's letter of
24 April 1997 referred to above,
that the money was paid as costs rather than
consideration for the assignment.  However, that rather self serving statement
was made
only upon challenge by Blake Dawson Waldron of Smith's claim that he
was entitled to have that sum treated as secured under the mortgage
debenture.
I do not ignore the fact that the 1996 assignment itself states a consideration
of $1.325 million.  That does not preclude
the $27,787.88 being consideration
for an agreement to grant the assignment; the $1.325 million would have been a
past consideration
in respect of that agreement.  Upon all the evidence, I
should find, if necessary, that the sum was paid by Smith as consideration
for
the 1996 assignment, and not in discharge of any liability as surety.  I do
find that Smith has not established that the payment
was made by him in his
capacity as surety, rather than on some other account.  Since it is not
established that the payment was made
by Smith as surety, his claim under the
general law of subrogation (or by reference to s 3 of the LRMP Act) in relation
to the $27,787.88
must fail.
<P>

27	In the case of this claim, equally as with the costs claim, I do not need to
determine the defence of estoppel.  However, if
I had to determine it, I should
uphold the defence.  The $27,787.88 is claimed under the rubric of costs.
Subrogation in relation
to costs under the mortgage debenture was claimed from
the outset of proceedings 1913/95 (see, for instance, the claim made in the
amended statement of claim as set out in [7]).  It does seem to be true, so far
as I can perceive, that at the trial before Young
J minds were concentrated
upon the issue relating to the $1.325 million.  But, whilst it was done
shortly, the question of whether
the security extended to costs was dealt with
in the judgment of the Court of Appeal:  see [9] and [10] above.  Upon doubts
arising
as to whether this item (inter alia) could be raised in the inquiry
ordered by the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal motion was
taken out and
determined before Meagher JA, as set out in [14] above.  It was submitted to me
that Meagher JA's decision that this
matter was not within the inquiry ordered
by the Court of Appeal was made on the ground that it was totally outside the
subject litigation
and therefore ought be agitated in separate proceedings.  It
may be possible, if one looks only at the order that the motion be dismissed,
to take this view.  However, I respectfully take the view, by reference to his
short reasons for judgment, that his Honour dealt
with the "validity" of the
claim that the item fell within the security so as to be a proper subject of
the inquiry ordered.  No
review of Meagher JA's order was sought.  The matter
thus commenced with a pleading that refers to costs and concluded with only
one
order that contains a possibly relevant reference to costs, followed by a
ruling of a Judge of Appeal that there is no validity
in the argument that this
claim is within that order.  On that basis it seems to me that it would be
appropriate to say that the
claim is <i>res judicata.</i>  If I am not correct
in that characterisation, in my mind either there would be an issue estoppel in
relation to this particular
matter or, if the matter is taken not to have been
so decided by the Court of Appeal as to attract doctrines of either <i>res
judicata</i> or issue estoppel, it is certainly a matter which Smith ought
reasonably to have raised and had determined by the courts in those
proceedings, so that the extended <b>Anshun</b> principle would apply.  For
these reasons, as I have said, I should uphold the estoppel defence if it were
necessary for me to do
so.
<P>

28	The claim for the $27,787.88 might be made out if it were made by Smith as
assignee under the 1996 assignment.  The pleadings
and written and oral
submissions in this case have been so confused that I find it difficult to
determine whether the claim has been
made on this basis.  The proposed amended
cross claim as set out in [25] above is unclear as to whether the claim is made
in that
way.  This is not very satisfactory, in view of what I have said in
[15] above as to the circumstances in which the amended pleading
is now
propounded.  The submissions were also most unclear.  It would be possible to
say that no such claim should now be acceded
to, since it has not been clearly
pleaded and put.  This I hesitate to do in the light of history.  This
litigation has been bedevilled
by excessive pugnacity on both sides, as Young J
has previously been moved to remark.  It has also been bedevilled by the
complexity
of the subject matter and by multiple proceedings.  It seems to me
that there is a case that Smith is entitled to relief on this
basis.  I have
found the payment of costs of $27,787.88 such as to fall within the mortgage
debenture as between the ANZ and YDSI,
so that that sum was secured to the ANZ
as against YDSI.  It has been found by the Court of Appeal that the mortgage
debenture is
still in force.  The ANZ's rights under the mortgage debenture
have been expressly assigned to Smith.  This occurred on 24 December
1996.  The
substantive judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered on 21 November 1996.
The 1996 assignment was not and could not
have been adverted to in the course
of proceedings 1913/95 and CA 40392/95 up to the time of the last mentioned
judgment.  In my
view there can therefore be no operative defence of estoppel
in respect of an independent claim by Smith under the 1996 assignment.
 In view
of the matters of history set out above, I am of the view that I should hear
further submissions concerning this potential
or actual head of claim.  I take
this course in the interest of the finality of litigation, to obviate the
possibility of further
proceedings and further defences of estoppel.
<P>

<b>Conclusion:  The Guarantee Fees</b>
<P>

29	The question of whether or not under the general law of subrogation Smith is
entitled to have these payments regarded as secured
to him under the mortgage
debenture turns upon the same three questions as were posed in relation to the
$27,787.88.  Those questions
may be stated as follows in relation to this
subject matter:
<P>

1	Whether the guarantee fees claimed were in fact owed by YDSI to the ANZ.
<P>

2	Whether the payments were made by Smith.
<P>

3	Whether they were made in his capacity or guise as a surety.
<P>

As to <b>question 1</b>, it has been argued that either Smith or Management
Services (or perhaps both) undertook primary liability for the fees either
before
or under the arrangements made in respect of the two bank guarantees of
$1.325 million each given in April 1994.  I do not accept
the argument that
Management Services contractually accepted liability for guarantee fees through
the directions in 1993 that its
account be debited with them.  Looking at the
1994 documentation relating to the bank guarantee given in respect of Smith's
half
share, there are certainly arguments open upon the face of what I have
described as the confused concatenation of documentation that
Smith (or
Management Services) assumed primary liability for the fees.  However, it is
submitted on behalf of Smith that it flows
from the decision of the Court of
Appeal of the central question in the appeal, as set out in [10] above, that
YDSI itself ought
be regarded as primarily liable for the fees, since Smith
requested and/or entered into the 1994 arrangement on its behalf.  Whilst
provision is not made in that documentation for payment of the guarantee fees
by YDSI, neither is provision specifically made for
its responsibility for the
$1.325 million, if that sum were called up under the guarantee, as indeed it
was.  The matter is not entirely
easy, but in my opinion the view that is
better and is in accordance with the Court of Appeal's earlier judgment is
that, as the
guarantee was taken out on behalf of YDSI, whoever else might be
liable to the ANZ for the fees, YDSI was itself liable.  In my opinion
this
conclusion is not precluded by the fact that YDSI was no longer a customer of
the ANZ, in the sense that it did not have an
operating account (although it is
referred to as "the customer" in the bank guarantee itself, one of the many
confusions in the set
of documents is that within its boundaries there are two
persons defined as "the customer").  Once this conclusion is reached, there
is
potential for the fees to fall within the security in favour of some other
person if that other person pays the fees in the guise
of surety.  This means
that it is necessary to answer <b>question 2</b>, Did Smith pay the fees?  My
conclusion is that he did not do so.  The fees were paid by Management
Services.  In the documentation,
the arrangement was that the fees should be
debited to Management Services' account.  Upon their being debited to that
account there
is no suggestion of there being a corresponding debit to a loan
account, unlike the situation with the $27,787.88.  At least from
April 1994,
Management Services was undoubtedly a surety for YDSI's liability for the
guarantee fees; it may have been so previously,
although this, yet again, is
not clear (as to which see [30] below).  The correct conclusion appears to me
to be that these payments
were made by Management Services.  I find that at
least those made after April 1994 in respect of the bank guarantee relating to
Smith's half share were made in its guise as a surety of YDSI's liability.  In
any event, I decline to find that any of the payments
of bank guarantee fees
claimed was made by Smith.  That is fatal to the argument that these payments
are secured under the mortgage
debenture in favour of Smith.  <b>Question 3</b>
does not arise in relation to these payments.  Nor is it necessary to consider
the defence of estoppel in relation to this claim.
<P>

30	However, the considerations are different in relation to the claim made to
the same moneys under the 1998 assignment.  I have
found in [29] that at least
those payments made after April 1994 in respect of the bank guarantee relating
to Smith's half share
were made by Management Services in its guise as a surety
of YDSI's liability to the ANZ.  In those circumstances Management Services
was
subrogated to the ANZ's rights under the mortgage debenture.  That entitlement
was assigned to Smith under the 1998 assignment.
 He is to that extent entitled
to the security of the mortgage debenture, and it should be declared
accordingly.  I find it difficult
to perceive, in the evidentiary maze of this
case, whether Management Services was also a surety in respect of the fees paid
on account
of the bank guarantee relating to Daly's half share, or on account
of the $2.65 million bank guarantee current up to April 1994.
 Further
submissions on the extent of the declaration appropriate on the state of the
evidence may be put when short minutes are
brought in.
<P>

<b>The Result</b>
<P>

31	It flows from my conclusions above that Smith as cross claimant is entitled
to at least some declaratory relief upon the amended
cross claim, as indicated
above.  So far as concerns YDSI's claim upon the amended summons for injunctive
relief in relation to the
appointment of the receiver, this cannot be
determined until I deal finally with the claim for the $27,787.88.  I shall
give directions
to permit the final determination of that matter.  There may be
argument at the same time as to the proper extent of the declaratory
relief in
respect of the guarantee fees   Short minutes may thereafter be brought in of
the orders which the parties contend are
appropriate once the final
determination has been made.  Questions of costs may be raised when the short
minutes are brought in.
