<b>FRIDAY 9 JULY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>4126/98 - JAMILA ROBB V DIRECTOR GENERAL DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES
&amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The plaintiff, who is the maternal
grandmother of a child, Isabella, who was born on 7 April 1998, seeks that
Isabella be made a ward
of court and that the plaintiff have her care and
control.
<P>

2   	In order to retain as much anonymity as possible, I will
refer to the parties by their first names.
<P>

3   	Isabella's parents are the second defendant Trina, the
plaintiff's youngest child, who is now aged 21, and the third defendant,
Domenico.  The second and third defendants are not married to each other and
they appear to be living in different homes, though
the third defendant says he
spends a lot time in the second defendant's home.
<P>

4   	The second defendant has another child Theron, a boy now
aged  three, having been born on 31 August 1995.  The third defendant
is not
Theron's father, as the second defendant only met him in 1997.  Theron is
currently living with Trina.
<P>

5   	On 7 July 1998 the second and third defendants signed a
general consent for Isabella's adoption.  They indicated a specific
desire that
Isabella be brought up in the Christian faith and not be placed with adoptive
persons of the Muslim faith.  Significantly
the plaintiff is of the Muslim
faith.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff did have the care and control of Isabella for
two weeks from about 16 June 1998.  I will deal with the circumstances
of that
in due course.
<P>

7   	From July 1998 the plaintiff reluctantly relinquished
Isabella to the Department of Community Services, the first defendant
in these
proceedings, and she has been in the care of approved foster parents since at
least September 1998.
<P>

8   	Unfortunately, it became apparent in late 1998 that
Isabella is suffering from some serious health problems. Just how serious
they
are and what impact they will have on her life is not yet clear, but it may
well be that as a result of what was found on Isabella's
CT scan that she will
have severe developmental problems, to say the least.
<P>

9   	The application made by the plaintiff by her summons of 1
October 1998 is for wardship.  Practically speaking, Isabella's fate
will
almost certainly be adoption, one way or the other.  Refusal of this
application may well lead to adoption of Isabella by one
of three couples whom
the Department has assessed as being suitable adopting parents. Granting this
application may well lead in
due course to a successful application for
adoption by the plaintiff, depending on what bonding takes place between the
plaintiff
and Isabella over the next few years.
<P>

10   	 This Court has wardship jurisdiction, which is part of
its inherent jurisdiction and exercised in two distinct types of cases.
 First,
there is protective wardship, where the court makes sure that minors are not
preyed upon.  Under protective wardship one
makes sure that the minor has the
rights, but no more than the rights, of any other citizen and bears in mind not
only the minor's
rights but also the rights of others.
<P>

11   	The second type of wardship is custodial wardship, where
the welfare of the child is paramount; as to the difference between
the two
classes of cases see <b>S v McC</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 24</a>, 48.
<P>

12   	However, the fact that the welfare of the child is
paramount does not mean that all other factors are irrelevant.  One takes
into
account, for instance, other factors such as the attitude and feelings of those
close to the infant.
<P>

13   	Secondly, when one is working out the welfare of the child
one does not limit oneself to financial welfare or to see which
of a number of
competing persons is the richest or most able to provide the best material
comforts for the child.  As Lord Esher
MR said over one hundred years ago in<b>
R v Gyngall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%202%20QB%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 2 QB 232</a>, 243:
<P>

"The Court has to consider ...  the whole circumstances of the case ... .
Prima facie it would not be for the welfare of a child
to be taken away from
its natural parent and given over to other people who have not that natural
relation to it.  Every wise man
would say that, generally speaking, the best
place for a child is with its parent.  If a child is brought up, as one may
say, from
its mother's lap in one form of religion, it would not, I should say,
be for its happiness and welfare that a stranger should take
it away in order
to alter its religious views.  Again, it cannot be merely because the parent is
poor and the person who seeks to
have the possession of the child as against
the parent is rich, that, without regard to any other consideration, to the
natural rights
and feelings of the parent, or the feelings and views that have
been introduced into the heart and mind of the child, the child ought
to be
taken away from its parent merely because its pecuniary position will be
thereby bettered.  No wise man would entertain such
suggestions as these ... .
It is the welfare of the child in the largest sense of the term that is to be
considered."
<P>

14   	Thus I have to assess whether, bearing in mind the welfare
of the child in the largest sense of the term, would an order for
wardship be
preferable to leaving the matters the way that they are?
<P>

15   	In one sense the making of a wardship order will be
permanent until the child becomes sixteen.  However, in a practical sense
the
order will not necessarily last that long for two reasons.  First, the court
will exercise regular superintendence and require
regular reports as to the
child's welfare and, secondly, as I said earlier, the probabilities are that
within the next five years
the child will be adopted under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/" class="autolink_findacts">Adoption of
Children Act 1965</a>.
<P>

16   	It is necessary to look at some of the history of the
persons involved in this case.  The plaintiff is now 46 years of age.
 She has
four children one son and three daughters.  Trina was born on 31 December 1977,
and so is now 21 years of age.  The plaintiff
and Trina's father separated in
1984.  Trina initially lived with her father, but then went and lived with her
mother.
<P>

17   	In 1993 there were one or two incidents between the
plaintiff and Trina.  The plaintiff says that the major incident was that
Trina
stayed away from her home and, contrary to the rules, went to premises occupied
by Timezone.  Her mother thought that Trina
was at her father's house, and when
she found her at Timezone she grabbed her by the hair and attempted to take her
home.  The police
intervened.  The plaintiff says that any tugging of the hair
was simply because the hair was the nearest place to tug and that in
due course
the mother and daughter were hugging each other.
<P>

18   	The other incident that happened about the same time was
that the plaintiff encouraged, it would seem, a man of the Muslim
faith from
Jordan or Syria in his early 20s to inspect Trina to see whether she was suited
for matrimony.  This appears to be culturally
correct in the Muslim faith, but
it was something that Trina did not find acceptable.  Trina reacted by leaving
the home.
<P>

19   	Trina says that she has been away from her mother with
virtually no communication for about five years.  The plaintiff says
that that
is not so and that there have been many contacts.
<P>

20   	Trina gave birth to Theron on 31 August 1995.
<P>

21   	After the birth of Isabella in April 1998 Isabella was
left with a Mr and Mrs D by way of an informal adoption arrangement.
  It would
seem that the Department came to hear about this and was not particularly
happy, and made that clear to Trina.  Trina
spoke to her sister Jasmein and on
16 June 1998 Trina and Jasmein were parties to an arrangement of delivering the
child to the plaintiff.
<P>

22   	Trina informed the Department and on 19 June 1998 the
Department wrote to the plaintiff saying that they were concerned that
Isabella
was in an illegal placement, but "as they have now been informed that Isabella
has been placed in the care of her grandmother
the Department no longer has
concerns about Isabella's legal status".  However, they said they would
carefully watch what was happening.
<P>

23   	I have seen Trina in the witness box.  It may be that she
was having a day when she was not feeling particularly happy with
the world,
and may not have given evidence to her best advantage, but she did not come
across as a very likeable person at all. 
She seemed particularly vindictive
towards her mother.  It may be that she considers herself to have good grounds
to be in that situation,
but certainly a sort of viciousness against her mother
came through from her evidence.  She did admit, however, that the plaintiff
was
experienced in child care.
<P>

24   	It seemed to me that it was more likely than not that the
reason why Trina delivered up Isabella to the plaintiff was more
a means of
getting the Department off her back, if I can use that expression, than with
any genuine assessment that the child would
be better with her grandmother than
with Mr And Mrs D or anyone else.  However, I really do not need to pursue that
very far because
it is only a peripheral  matter.
<P>

25   	On 1 July 1998 there was an incident at the Bankstown
Railway Station, which I do not need to go into in detail, but shortly
thereafter the child was put into the care of the Department and on 7 July 1998
Trina and Domenico signed adoption consent forms.
 As I say, they particularly
specified that the child was not to be brought up as a Muslim.
<P>

26   	The plaintiff gives a different story generally.  She says
that in mid-June 1998 Trina left Isabella with her on the basis
that she would
be cared for indefinitely; that she was happy to do this and although she has
had differences with Trina there is
still an open and loving relationship
between them and she is prepared to permit Trina to dictate wishes as to the
upbringing of
the child, to a certain extent, including the child's religious
upbringing, even though the plaintiff herself is strongly of the
Muslim
faith.
<P>

27   	I do not really think that there is much purpose in going
into the evidence as to what happened in June and July 1998.  What
is
significant, however, is this, the officers of the Department quite clearly
accepted virtually everything Trina said and gave
little credence to anything
the plaintiff said.
<P>

28   	When the matter first came before me for hearing on 11
March 1999 I heard the evidence of the plaintiff, Trina, Domenico and
an
officer of the Department.  Of the three I thought that Domenico was more
likely to be correct and presented as quite an articulate
and thoughtful young
man.
<P>

29   	Trina, as I said, appeared to be vindictive.  On the other
hand, the plaintiff appeared to have tremendous optimism as to
a rosy future
with Isabella, casting aside as just unlikely many of the problems that may
well occur.
<P>

30   	The departmental officer, however, gave the impression to
me that she had found the facts solely in the way Trina had put
them, without
exception, and had made her assessment of the plaintiff on that basis.  I
thought, in view of my own assessment of
Trina, that this was probably unwise
and also that the plaintiff deserved to have an impartial assessment made.  I
contemplated making
an order for wardship so that I could ensure that the
plaintiff got a fair deal.
<P>

31   	However, there was not time to finish the case that day
and I mouthed some of those thoughts.  I had been told that the Department
was
ready to reassess the situation, provided that the summons was dropped, and I
thought that this was again unfair to the plaintiff.
 However, when the matter
did not finish on 11 March a general agreement was reached between the lawyers
that the plaintiff would
be assessed as a potential adopting parent by a person
to be agreed on between the parties; that I would have that report in due
course and that the Department would consider the matter after the report was
in.
<P>

32   	Although there were some glitches, in due course the
report was made by a clinical psychologist Mary Anderson and that is
Exhibit
DX03.  That report was seen by the Supervisor of Permanent Care with the
adoption unit of the Department and she is of the
view,  following that report,
that the Department's attitude to the plaintiff remains the same.  The
Department does not favour this
application nor at this stage adoption of
Isabella by the plaintiff.
<P>

33   	In one sense I have fulfilled my task.  The law generally
gives to the Department, and to the Director General as the guardian
of the
child, the determination of what is in the child's interest.  This court has
its inherent power, its parens patriae jurisdiction,
but that is a reserve
jurisdiction to be exercised in time of need or where in consequence the court
sees that it needs to intervene.
 It is not exercised unless the ordinary
processes have somehow or other miscarried; that is to say whilst the court has
jurisdiction
to intervene it exercises its discretion not to intervene, save in
those cases.  One reason is that the legislature has primarily
committed the
matter to the Director General and, secondly, questions of costs are
relevant.
<P>

34   	However, as the matter has been fully argued, I will deal
with the respective contentions.  Mr M Anderson of counsel for the
plaintiff
puts that this is a case where the plaintiff has shown that it is best for the
child that there be a wardship order and
in due course possibly adoption of
Isabella by the plaintiff.
<P>

35   	He puts that the plaintiff herself was adopted as a child.
She went through the trauma of adoption and not knowing her roots
and she is
convinced that it is in the child's best interest that the child be kept within
the family circle.  She says that Trina
is, for the moment, exaggerating the
rift in relationships between mother and daughter and the plaintiff suspects
that that is because
of pressure that was being put on her by a third party,
rather than that being her true feelings.
<P>

36   	The plaintiff says that the question of her being a Muslim
is just a red herring.  She says that she is prepared to let the
child develop
with religious instruction from others, and that she will not compel the child
to follow in the Muslim faith.  She
says that with the assistance of the
appropriate government department despite her present situation, in which she
is sharing a house,
she will move into public housing with appropriate
accommodation for the child; that she genuinely loves the child; that she has
already cared for the child for a couple of weeks; (the mother concedes that
the plaintiff is an experienced parent).  Further, she
understands the child
will need medical treatment, she is prepared to give her that treatment and
both the short and long term interests
of the child are to be with the
plaintiff.
<P>

37   	Mr Bourke of counsel appeared for the Department on 11
March and Mr Singleton, solicitor, appeared today.  Both very carefully
and
fairly summarised the problems that the Department sees in making this
order.
<P>

38   	I think it is probably as good a way as any to go through
the eleven issues that Mr Singleton raised to come to an assessment
of what is
in the interests of the child.  I will list the issues first and then deal with
them one by one.
<P>

1.  The severance of the biological family.  
<P>

2.  The religious issue.  
<P>

3.  The parenting ability of the plaintiff. 
<P>

4.  The relationship of the plaintiff and the biological  mother.  
<P>

5.  The capacity of the plaintiff to deal with the child's medical problems.

<P>

6.  Accommodation and housing. 
<P>

7.  The problem of double severance.  
<P>

8.  The preference of the child's natural mother.  
<P>

9.  The intergenerational issue. 
<P>

10. The relationship of the plaintiff and the Department; and 
<P>

11.  The capacity of the court and the Department to make an assessment of
adoptive parents.
<P>

39   	1.   As I have said earlier, I consider that it is a very
strong factor that, if possible, children should remain within their
biological
families.  They there can develop natural relationships with blood brothers and
sisters and with uncles and aunts, and
the relationship by blood does, probably
because of compatibility factors and otherwise, very often lead to a happier
child generally.
<P>

40   	Thus I share the plaintiff's views, which she has formed
as a result of being adopted herself, of the general unsuitability
of being
removed from the biological family. This factor is strongly in the plaintiff's
favour.
<P>

41   	2.   The religious issue really falls into two parts.  The
first is whether the biological parents have made a valid assessment
of what is
good for the child's religious upbringing, or whether they have just said that
she is not to be a Muslim so as to exclude
the plaintiff from any possible
adoption.
<P>

42   	I believe that the truth is closer to the second
proposition than the first, but that when one analyses it properly the
experience
with the plaintiff has probably led to the determination that the
child should not be brought up a Muslim, rather than this being
just a
statement made to spite the plaintiff.
<P>

43   	Although Trina herself had no religious upbringing, she
says she has found Catholicism and she wants her child to be brought
up in that
religion.  As I said recently in <b>Re C &amp; The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/" class="autolink_findacts">Adoption of Children
Act</a></b>, 15 November 1994, unreported, the biological parent's specification of
the religion in which she wishes her child to be brought
up is a factor which
is not to be lightly ignored.  See also <b>Re M </b>(1967) 87 WN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Pt 1)</a> (NSW)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">48</a>.  On the other hand, I agree with both Mr Anderson and Mr Singleton when
they say it is not an issue which would veto an adoption
by a person who was
not of the religion that the mother specifies, and authorities such as<b> Re
E</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20NSWLR%20739" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 NSWLR 739</a> go along with this.
<P>

44   	The other part of the religious issue is the capacity of
the plaintiff to comply with the mother's wishes.  I have briefly
set out what
the plaintiff says about this matter, that is that she will not impede the
child being brought up in the Catholic religion
and will allow her to have
religious instruction from others.  On the other hand, the plaintiff has firm
religious views herself
and there is evidence from an expert in Islamic studies
that the Koran is the manifesto of how Muslims must endeavour to be, think
and
do and to pass on the faith to their children and their children's children is
what God requires of them.  Accordingly, he opines,
either the plaintiff
herself or those whose influence will be strong over the plaintiff in religious
matters will feel considerable
pressure not to honour the understanding and
have the child brought up in the Muslim faith.  This is a factor to take into
account.
<P>

45   	3.  As to the parenting ability of the plaintiff, there is
evidence that she has brought up four children and that she has
experience in
child care.  However, there is also the incidents between the plaintiff and
Trina in 1993.  The Timezone matter is
perhaps explicable, but the Muslim man
episode is not so.  It is quite clear from Exhibit PX01, which is the
Department's notes on
the incidents and later, that the Department did not
consider that the plaintiff emerged from those incidents wholly without blame.
There is also the problem that after her separation the children or some of the
children elected to live with the plaintiff's ex
husband.
<P>

46   	Thus there must be some suspicion about the parenting
ability of the plaintiff.
<P>

47   	4.   As to the relationship between the plaintiff and the
biological mother, my view is that although I have some distrust
of Trina's
evidence I believe that the plaintiff is adopting an overly optimistic view as
to the relationship.  The evidence indicates
to me that there has been little
contact over the last five years and the handing over of the child was to play
off the Department
against the plaintiff, rather than anything else.  I hope,
but cannot see, any evidence of the fact that the relationship may get
better,
but I think that if things stand as they are at the moment there is sufficient
ill-feeling, at least on Trina's side, for
the relationship not to be
normal.
<P>

48   	5.   As to the child's medical problems, as I have said
earlier these may well be severe, but no-one knows yet. Mr Singleton
said that
when one reads Mary Anderson's report (DX03) one gets the flavour that the
plaintiff was often expressing the thought that
she still wanted to care for
Isabella and that she would make arrangements for her care, but she did not
really show any deep appreciation
of just how significant those problems might
be and just what strain might be involved.
<P>

49   	6.   So far as accommodation is concerned, at present the
plaintiff is a "sub-tenant" with one room in a house which is rented
from the
Housing Commission by a gentleman whom the plaintiff describes as her
"flatmate".  There is no evidence as to how the flatmate
would appreciate or
not appreciate a young child around the house.
<P>

50   	However, Mr Anderson says that really this is just a
temporary matter as almost certainly if she does have the care and control
of
the child the plaintiff will get some public housing.  I think that comment is
probably right.
<P>

51   	7.   The child has been with foster carers for ten months
and Mary Anderson's report says that she has been stabilized in
her current
placement and is rapidly attaching to her current carers.  She goes on to say
that Isabella is likely to experience some
distress at being moved and movement
to long term placement needs to be carefully planned with some intensive
introductory period.
<P>

52   	Mr Singleton says if this application does not succeed
then the probability will be that the Department will make its assessment
of
the best adopting parents for the child and she will then move from her foster
parents once to the care of those new people. 
It may be that something will go
wrong and she will have to be moved again, but the odds are against it.
<P>

53   	On the other hand, if the child is now moved to the
plaintiff's care and then in due course to other adopting  parents there
will
be a double severance and this will affect the child emotionally much more.  An
answer to this is, of course, that the child
may never move from the
plaintiff's care because the plaintiff may adopt her.  However, it seems to me
that on balance this point
goes in favour of the Department.
<P>

54   	8.   The preference of the natural mother is for adoption
by outsiders and I agree with Mr Singleton that this factor has
to be taken
into account.
<P>

55   	9.   The intergenerational issue.  This Court takes the
view that it should be extremely careful before it makes an adoption
order in
favour of an aunt or a grandmother for the reason that the child gets confused
as to its familial relationships. In England
in<b> Re DX</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20Ch%20320" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] Ch 320</a> and
in this Court in<b> Re X </b>(1964) 81 WN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Pt 1)</a> (NSW) 335, it was said that an
order for adoption in favour of a child's grandparents will only be made in
exceptional circumstances
while the child's mother is alive.  I considered a
similar case recently in<b> Re W</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/662.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 662</a> in connection with an
adoption by an aunt.
<P>

56   	However, as Mr Anderson has pointed out, there have been,
despite that general rule, adoptions by grandmothers which have
been ordered by
the court and he gives as an example the decision of Waddell J in<b> Re The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/" class="autolink_findacts">Adoption of Children Act</a></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%205%20Fam%20LN%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 5 Fam LN 15.</a>  Recently too in <b>Re T</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20NZLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 NZLR 373</a> Tompkins J said that there was no such general proposition
that adoption orders should only be made in favour of grandparents in
exceptional circumstances and particularly in connection with people of Samoan
background one approaches the matter without any such
general rule.  Despite<b>
Re T</b>, it does seem to me that the general rule that has been adopted in
this State and in England is a salutary one and is generally supported
by the
evidence of psychologists that has been received in adoption matters over the
years.
<P>

57   	Again it is not a point upon which the plaintiff who is a
grandmother must fail, but it is certainly one that goes against
her.
<P>

58   	10.  The relationship between the plaintiff and the
Department is not good.  Whose fault it is does not matter.  Because of
the
child's medical problems, the Department will be involved in her nurture at
least in the foreseeable future and it does not help
the application if there
is that bad relationship.  Mr Anderson says that once this Court has vindicated
the plaintiff and given
her the child she will be happy personally and with the
Department, but I think, with great respect, that is a little too
optimistic.
<P>

59   	11.  The probabilities will be that if the child is
adopted outside the family she will be adopted by a couple, rather than
by a
single woman.  The maxim Mr Singleton gave me of "better two parents than one"
is, I think, one that fits in with the policy
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/" class="autolink_findacts">Adoption of Children Act
1965</a>.  Again, this is not a point which bars an application because the Act
does allow for adoption by one person alone under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19(2)</a> but, again, it is
something which makes one hesitate.
<P>

60   	Having listed those eleven points one must make an overall
assessment as to whether the order for wardship is in the child's
interest.
<P>

61   	It seems to me that the plaintiff starts off ahead as she
is the biological grandmother and the child will stay within the
family, but I
also consider that the assessment of the other points means that it has not
been demonstrated that it would be best
for the child to go with the plaintiff
as the carer and controller under the wardship of this Court and, accordingly,
the summons
must be dismissed.
<P>

62   	Since I delivered my reasons there has been discussion on
the question of costs which is a very difficult one.  Mr Singleton
submits that
because the Department was successful it should get its costs.  Mr Anderson, on
the other hand, says that this was a
case where an individual with small means
was suing a government department because there was no other way in which she
could get
redress and she has to a degree been vindicated, even though when
things are partially assessed she still lost.
<P>

63   	Although I think the general principle of the successful
party getting his or her costs with the unsuccessful party paying
those costs
does apply in this sort of case, the authorities tend to suggest that other
factors also come into play.  In cases between
husband and wife over custody
the court has often taken the view that orders against wives should often not
be made.  In many cases
wives were put off from seeking custody merely because
their husbands had more money and they would be bankrupted if they lost. 
On
occasion the court has ordered the father should pay the costs of an
application by the mother for custody in which she was unsuccessful.
 Often too
no order was made for costs such as in <b>Calder v Charlton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%209%20Fam%20LR%20285" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 9 Fam LR
285</a>, where both sides had made highly coloured allegations against each other,
some of which succeeded and some of which did not.  Again
when there is a fight
over wardship between two parties who are related to the child, a factor in the
equation is that it is not
in the child's interest to further alienate the
parties by making an order for costs;<b> Jolley v Payne</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%207%20Fam%20LR%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 7 Fam LR
81.</a>
<P>

64   	Insofar as this was an application of an administrative
law matter, the ordinary rules as to costs would seem to apply, save
that there
is some authority for the proposition that private citizens should not be
dissuaded from taking actions against departments
when something is awry for
fear of having to pay costs.
<P>

65   	I have wavered from side to side, but I think on balance
that the plaintiff should pay two-thirds of the Department's costs.
 I say
two-thirds because I do think that some of the material before the court and
some of the investigation that went into this
case really needed to be done in
the interests of the child.  That material includes Mary Anderson's report.  I
also bear in mind
that at least up to 11 March there was some genuine
apprehension by the plaintiff that she was not getting a fair go.  I do not
think
that it is really expedient to say anything more than that.
