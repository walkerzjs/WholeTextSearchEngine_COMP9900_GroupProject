FRIDAY 14 MAY 1999

<b>4795/98 - DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION  V  SYDNEY CONCRETE STEEL FIXING
PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: In this matter the applicant, Deborah Russell, as a
contributory, seeks orders including an order under s 482(1)
of the
Corporations Law for the termination of the winding up of the defendant
company, which was ordered to be wound up by the Registrar
of this Court on 6
May 1999.  The applicant also seeks on order that she be joined as a party to
the proceedings and that the summons
for winding up be dismissed.
<P>

2  	The evidence indicates that her notice of motion has been served
on the plaintiff/creditor, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation,
and that the
plaintiff neither supports nor opposes her application.  Additionally the
application has been served on the liquidator
and he also neither supports nor
opposes the application.  Both of those parties note their fees and I am
informed by counsel that
payment of the fees will be attended to today.
<P>

3  	When the matter first came before me on Wednesday 12 May 1999 I
was not satisfied that the evidence was sufficiently strong
to justify the
orders sought at that stage.  I, therefore, adjourned the matter to today to
give the applicant the opportunity to
present further evidence and to serve her
application on the parties to the proceedings.
<P>

4  	The applicant has now produced further evidence which satisfies
me that the substantive orders sought in her application should
be made.
<P>

5  	This is only one of a number of applications which have come
before the Court in the last few days of the kind which is quite
frequently
made.  Typically the problem arises because those in control of the company
have failed to take proper steps to deal with
a statutory demand and summons
for winding up, and consequently the company is ordered to be wound up in their
absence.  Sometimes
there is evidence that the director, or directors, of the
company have not acted swiftly enough to dispute the statutory demand and
resist the summons for winding up, though grounds were available.  Sometimes
the evidence is that instructions have been given to
an accountant or solicitor
to ensure that payment is made in a timely fashion and, for one reason or
another, those instructions
have not been complied with.  Other explanations
are possible.
<P>

6  	In <i>George Ward Steel Pty Limited  v  Kizkot Pty Limited
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2015%20ACLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 15 ACLR 464</a> Hodgson J considered what is required in an application
of this kind.  The headnote for the case states:
<P>

`A court will normally set aside a winding up order  if:
<P>

(a)	the order is made in the absence of the defendant company;
<P>

(b)	an application is brought promptly by the company;
<P>

(c)	notice is given to the liquidator, to the person who sought to have the
company wound up and to any creditor who appeared at
the hearing;
<P>

(d)	the evidence shows an explanation for the non-appearance;
<P>

(e)	there is consent or at least no opposition to the setting aside; and
<P>

(f)	the liquidator shows there is nothing in his investigations to date showing
a reason for the company to be stopped from trading.'
<P>

7  	What sometimes happens is that an application is brought which
literally complies with these requirements but says nothing significant
about
the solvency of the company or the capacity of the former managers to resume
management of it, except by virtue of affidavit
evidence supplied by a
director.  Typically nowadays the company is a one director company in which
the director is also the shareholder.
<P>

8  	It seems to me that an application which relies only on evidence
deposed to by a single director-shareholder without any external
confirmation
is unlikely to be adequate to persuade a court to exercise the discretion
conferred by s 482(1) or to exercise a discretion
to set aside the orders under
Part 40 rule 9(3) of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

9  	The present case conforms to the typical pattern only partly.  In
the present case the applicant is a contributory who was the
shareholder of the
company.  There are affidavits purporting to explain the company's
non-appearance at the winding up hearing and
relevant financial matters, given
by both the company's sole director and the company's external accountant.
<P>

10  	I nevertheless hesitated to make the orders when the matter came
first before me because the evidence showed that the debt
upon which the
plaintiff took winding up proceedings was a debt for group tax and that the
company had had a history of late payment
of group tax and prescribed payments
tax.  I was also concerned that according to a balance sheet annexed to the
external accountant's
affidavit as at 30 April 1999 the company's assets
included a very large amount described as `receivable-trade debtors' and I was
apprehensive that those debts might be, to a substantial degree, aged debts
which could be unrecoverable. The balance sheet also
identified a significant
amount for current liabilities to trade creditors without any further
explanation.
<P>

11  	In these circumstances, although there was evidence that the
plaintiff and the liquidator neither supported nor opposed the
application, I
thought it appropriate to adjourn the matter so that evidence could be obtained
particularising the company's history
of payment of group tax and prescribed
payments tax, and giving more information about trade debtors and trade
creditors.  The plaintiff
and the liquidator would have the opportunity to
appear at the adjourned hearing.
<P>

12  	Now that further information has been supplied along the lines
indicated, verified by the affidavit of the external accountant,
rather than
simply an affidavit by the director, it seems to me appropriate that an order
be made under s 482.
<P>

13  	I make the following orders on the motion:  Orders 3, 4, 5 and
7.  I note the matter referred to in paragraph 6 of the motion.
