MONDAY 13 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>20295/1995</u>	<u>BEVERLEY BIKWAN CHEONG by her Tutor THE PROTECTIVE
COMMISSIONER OF NSW v KING LEUNG WONG &amp; ORS</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff suffered injury in a motor vehicle accident that
took place on 6 April 1994.  She has brought these proceedings
to recover
damages.  There are now six defendants.  A number of Cross-claims have been
brought.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff was a passenger in a vehicle being driven by the
first defendant.  Prior to the accident, the vehicle's rear nearside
tyre had
begun to separate and detach from the tyre carcass.  The first defendant lost
control of the vehicle and it veered onto
the incorrect side of the road
colliding with a vehicle coming in the opposite direction.
<P>

3  	The second defendant is the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority Of New
South Wales (RTA).  The third defendant was the owner of a
Mobil Service
Station (known as "Mobil Westmead").  It was an authorised inspection station.
The fourth defendant was its nominee.
 The fifth defendant was an employee of
the third defendant.  The sixth defendant is the manufacturer of the tyre.
<P>

4  	On 16 March 1994, the vehicle was taken to Mobil Westmead to
obtain a safety inspection report.  The inspection was carried
out by the fifth
defendant (an authorised examiner).  A safety inspection report was issued.
<P>

5  	The second defendant is sued in negligence.  There are
allegations of breach of duty which relate to the adequacy of its system
in
relation to tyre inspections.  These are referred to as allegations of direct
negligence.  Also, it is alleged that the second
defendant is liable for the
negligence of the third, fourth and fifth defendants, each of whom are said to
be the agent of the RTA.
 The allegations are pleaded in an Amended Statement
of Claim.
<P>

6  	The proceedings were commenced in 1995.  Originally, the first
defendant was the only defendant in the proceedings.  The second
defendant
became a party in early 1997.  On 1 June 1999, it filed the Notice of Motion
now before the court.
<P>

7  	The Notice of Motion claims relief in the alternative.  The first
alternative is the summary dismissal of the claim brought
against it.  The
second alternative is the separate determination of certain questions.
<P>

8  	The application was heard on 30 November 1999.  The relevant
evidence comprised two affidavits.  The RTA relied on an affidavit
sworn by Mr
Randall.  It deposed to inter alia the authorised inspection scheme, the
inspection process and RTA audits.  The plaintiff
relied on an affidavit sworn
by Mr Martin.  It annexed documentation (including the Inspection Report,
Traffic Collision Report and
reports from an expert).  The expert material
expresses the opinion that a competent examiner, properly inspecting the tyre,
should
have been aware that there was a defect present within the tyre carcass
and that the tyre carcass was unsafe for the purpose of registration
of the
vehicle.
<P>

9  	The court has a discretion to grant summary relief.  It is
exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances of the particular
case
and so that justice is best served between the parties.  The applicant bears
the onus.
<P>

10  	The authorities have effectively imposed restriction on the
granting of summary relief.  The authorities say that it should
be given only
in what might be described as clear cases (see inter alia <u>Webster v
Lampard</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598).</a>
<P>

11  	The authorities have also seen a reluctance to summarily
terminate cases in which negligence is alleged.  The tort of negligence
is not
static.  Generally speaking, the courts have been loath to determine questions
as to the existence of a duty of care otherwise
than at a trial.  At a trial,
the court has the advantage of considering the alleged duty of care in the
context of all of the relevant
evidence.
<P>

12  	The area of tort liability of public authorities has been seen
as a complex one.  The relevant law is far from settled.
<P>

13  	I now turn to the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties.
Counsel for both the RTA and the plaintiff have prepared detailed
written
submissions.  The written material was supplemented by oral argument.  There
were appearances on behalf of the first, third,
fourth and fifth defendants and
the first cross-defendant, who each adopted what had been said on behalf of the
plaintiff.
<P>

14  	Broadly speaking, the RTA advances two general propositions.
Firstly, it says that no duty of care is owed to the plaintiff.
 Secondly, it
is said that it has no vicarious liability for the acts of the third, fourth
and fifth defendants.
<P>

15  	The court was referred to the <u>Traffic Act</u> 1909 (the Act).
Part 2 of the Act enables the making of regulations (including regulations to
provide for the purposes of determining
whether or not motor vehicles are
suitable for safe use or comply with the requirements of the Act).  The
regulations made thereunder
set up the scheme (it is referred to as the AIS
scheme) which for relevant purposes has been administered by the RTA as the
regulatory
body.  The regulations authorise the issue by the RTA of rules to be
observed by inter alia inspectors.  Rules have been issued.
 The relevant rules
include 1.02 and 104.02.  Rule 1.02 sets out the functions of the RTA.  Rule
104.02 requires the examiner to
visually inspect each tyre carcass and to
reject it if it fails to satisfy specified criteria.
<P>

16  	The RTA takes the stance that it has the functions of a
licensing authority with power to administer a scheme in the public
interest
for the inspection and registration of motor vehicles.  It contends that these
functions are performed by empowering suitably
qualified persons to conduct
inspections, by issuing rules and by cancelling or suspending authorities
granted.  It contends that
its functions go no further.  In particular, it is
said that it has no statutory responsibility for the carrying out of the work
which is said in this case to have been performed negligently.  It disputes
that there is any basis for an agency relationship with
any of the third,
fourth or fifth defendants.
<P>

17  	The RTA has referred the court to a number of authorities
(including <u>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20192%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 192 CLR 330</a>,
<u>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 424</a> and <u>Sasin v
Commonwealth </u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2052%20ALR%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 52 ALR 299).</a>  It looks to the distinction that has been
drawn between planning and operational decisions.  It is said that the RTA was
engaged
in matters of planning and that the plaintiff's claim against it is not
justiciable.
<P>

18  	The authorities support the view that no duty of care exists on
a public authority in relation to decisions dictated by finance,
economics,
social or political constraints.  However, it has been said that it may be
otherwise when the courts are called upon to
apply a standard of care to that
which is the product of administrative direction, expert or professional
opinion, technical standards
or general standards of reasonableness.
<P>

19  	The plaintiff has also referred the court to a number of
authorities (including <u>RTA v Scroop</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20MVR%20233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 MVR 233</a> and <u>Crimmins v
Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 59).</a>  The plaintiff says
that there is an arguable case that a non-delegable common law duty of care was
owed by the RTA in relation to
the exercise of its functions.
<P>

20  	In my view, this application can be determined without the need
to embark on further analysis of the relevant facts and relevant
law.  It seems
to me, in the circumstances of this case, that the RTA has fallen short of
satisfying the court that the plaintiff
does not have an arguable case.  In my
view, it is not one of those clear cases required by the authorities.  There
are questions
which can only be resolved at a trial.
<P>

21  	Accordingly, in this case, I am not satisfied that the onus has
been discharged.  It seems to me, that justice is best served
if the claim
proceeds to trial.
<P>

22  	I may add that there has been delay in the bringing of the
application.  Generally speaking, applications of this nature should
be
promptly made.  The RTA has taken a number of steps in the proceedings
(including the filing of a Defence and the bringing of
Cross-claims against the
third, fourth and fifth defendants) prior to the making of the application.
<P>

23  	This was not a matter agitated by the parties.  Accordingly, I
have not taken it into account.  However, had it been argued,
it seems to me
that it would have been a relevant circumstance of some weight in the
circumstances of this particular case.
<P>

24  	The alternative relief relates to questions concerning the RTA.
It may be that these questions could be principal matters for
determination at
the trial and take up much of the hearing time.  At first blush, the view could
be taken that, there would be a
lack of utility in having them separately
determined.  However the alternative was not argued and the court was asked to
put it aside
for present purposes.
<P>

25  	I refuse the application for summary dismissal.  The second
defendant is to pay the costs of the application.  The balance
of the Notice of
Motion is stood over generally.
<P>
