&amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>(On admissibility of imputations (b) and (c) in Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim)</b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In these proceedings the defamatory matter is allegedly
contained in remarks of the second defendant on radio station 2UE on 17
January
1995.  A transcript of the relevant parts of the broadcast will be annexure A
to this Judgment.
<P>

2	Objection is taken to the imputations (b) and (c) alleged in the Second
Further Amended Statement of Claim which are as follows:

<P>

	"(b)	That decent lawyers would deplore his conduct at the committal hearing
of David John Zammit for the murder of Toula Soravia
and
<P>

	 (c)	That he is unfit to be a lawyer".
<P>

In relation to imputation (b), objection is taken both on the grounds of form
and capacity and in relation to imputation (c), only
as to capacity.
<P>

3	In my view, objection to imputation (b) on the ground of form fails.  When
the broadcast is read as a whole I am satisfied that
the persons whom it is
alleged would deplore the conduct of the plaintiff are identified as decent
lawyers in general and amounts
to an allegation that decent lawyers would
consider that the conduct of the plaintiff at the relevant committal hearing
was deplorable.
<P>

4	The fact that it is, in one sense, put in the passive tense in my view is not
fatal.  However, I am satisfied that the broadcast
is not capable, when read as
a whole, of conveying the imputation alleged.
<P>

5	It is submitted that the passage can be read as meaning that the speaker is
familiar with the standards of Messrs Conti QC and
Sullivan QC and they are
decent and they will appreciate the comments because they know there are
persons in the profession who "do
not fit the bill" or are not up to standard.
But whilst I am appreciative of the principle that in considering the
electronic media
and particularly its transient form, the capacity of the words
used to convey the imputations should be given a more generous construction:
<b><i>Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR
158</a> at 165 to 166, nevertheless when this broadcast is considered as a whole,
particularly the references to the fact that Alan Sullivan
QC has tried to
explain why lawyers sometimes say the things they do and later that, as he
points out, lawyers are paid to act in
the best interests of their clients, I
cannot see how the words used, when taken as a whole in their context, would be
capable of
conveying the imputation that "decent lawyers" would deplore the
conduct of the plaintiff.  Imputation (b) should therefore be struck
out.
<P>

6	As to imputation (c), a number of similar considerations apply but it seems
to me that, having regard to the more generous construction
used in the
electronic media to which I have referred, the context of the matter complained
of as a whole would be capable of conveying
the imputation that the plaintiff
is unfit to be a lawyer, and I decline to strike out imputation (c).
