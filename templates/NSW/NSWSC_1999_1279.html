<P>

<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	On 20 March 1998 I delivered judgment in relation to an
application by the defendant that the plaintiff be ordered to amend
the
Statement of Claim by adding certain material to the matter complained of, and
I made such an order in favour of the defendant.
<P>

2   	I am told that on the same date an amended statement of
claim was filed and presumably served.  I ordered also that the plaintiff
pay
the defendant's costs of that application.
<P>

3   	The defendant now seeks an order that the costs be assessed
and payable forthwith, without waiting until the conclusion of
the proceedings,
and relies on the provisions of Pt 52A r 9(1) which provides as follows:
<P>

"Where before the conclusion of any proceedings, other than proceedings entered
in the Commercial List or the Construction List,
the Court makes an order for
the payment of costs or a motion is refused with costs, the costs shall not,
unless the Court otherwise
orders, be payable until the conclusion of the
proceedings."
<P>

4   	Then defendant's present application  is based on the
assertion that the plaintiff acted unreasonably in refusing to take the
course
proposed and ultimately ordered, in resisting the application.
<P>

5   	The fact that the plaintiff was unsuccessful in that
application does not of itself establish that the conduct was unreasonable
and,
for the purpose of the present application, I was reminded of some evidence
that had been placed before me on the previous application,
and also provided
with an additional affidavit setting out at least some of the steps that had
been taken by the plaintiff or on
his behalf in relation to the issues with
which I was then concerned.
<P>

6   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff's conduct was
unreasonable or, to use the term adopted by counsel for the defendant,
specious.  But the fact remains that the plaintiff was unsuccessful in the
application.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff opposed the orders proposed, asserting that
he had taken a proper position initially and that the material that
was
available to him was such as to make the adoption of that position reasonable.
The plaintiff further relied upon delay on the
part of the defendant in
bringing this application.
<P>

8   	As I have noted, judgment was delivered on 20 March 1998
and I was told that the amended Statement of Claim had been filed
on 20 August
1998.  In response to that, I was provided with correspondence which shows that
some attempts had been made on the part
of the defendant to have this
application listed before me to suit the convenience of both of the counsel
originally involved in
my own commitments and that appears to have been an
explanation for at least part of the delay.
<P>

9   	The discretion provided by r 9(1) is a wide one and appears
to me to be unconfined.  It is true that given the  way the rule
is framed, the
prima facie position is that costs do not become payable until the conclusion
of the proceedings.  But the rule is
not framed in such a was as to require any
specific set of characterisation of circumstances in order to justify the
making of an
order.  There was no material placed before me as to financial
consequences for either of the parties should an order be made or
not made.
<P>

10   	There has been little, if any, progress in the matter
since the filing of the amended Statement of Claim so far as I can see,
and it
would appear that both parties are responsible for that lack of progress.  But
it is something into which it is not appropriate
or necessary to enquire
further.  So I am left with a balancing exercise.  In my opinion the defendant
is entitled to the benefit
of the costs order already made and, in the absence
of any hardship or disadvantage to the plaintiff, I am unable to see why the
rule should be construed as though she had some additional hurdle to overcome I
order to receive the benefit of it.
<P>

11   	On balance it seems to me that I should make an order that
the defendant's costs ordered by me on 20 March 1998 be assessed
and payable on
the conclusion of that assessment, and I so order.
<P>

12   	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of this
application.
<P>

13   	I will stand the matter over to 22 October for argument
and I direct the defendant to file and serve a written outline of
argument
noting all issues to be raised on or before 24 September, and the plaintiff to
respond by 8 October.
<P>
