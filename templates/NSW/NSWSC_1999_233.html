<P>

<b>Friday 26 March 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>070092/96  -  REGINA  v  Anthony Stuart MOFFATT [No 3]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:
<P>

<b>	Background</b>
<P>

1	The accused, Anthony Stuart Moffatt, has been charged with having murdered
Richard James Fyfe on or about the 26th April 1996.
 He has also been charged,
in the alternative, with a number of other offences of lesser gravity.  The
matter proceeded before me,
as a Judge sitting alone.
<P>

2	On 26 April 1996, at 12.38 am, the New South Wales Ambulance Service was
called to premises, flat 41, 59 Gerrale Street, Cronulla.
 It responded at
once.  At 12.45 am two ambulance officers entered those premises.  The police
were already there.  A male person,
later identified as Richard James Fyfe, was
seated on the floor, slumped forward.  He was examined, and found to be
dead.
<P>

3	The case against Mr Moffatt substantially rests upon admissions said to have
been made by him to neighbours, police and in a recorded
interview.  The
accused was, at the time of these events, an alcoholic.  The deceased was also
an alcoholic.  There were two other
persons present in the flat  They too were
alcoholics.  The accused did not give evidence before me.  Issues have been
raised, however,
through cross examination, as to whether the accounts he gave
at various stages that evening were fantasy, or confabulation.
<P>

<b>Anzac Day 1996</b>
<P>

4	Mr Moffatt shared a flat (41/59 Gerrale Street, Cronulla) with Mr Ronald
Godfrey.  He was 36.  Mr Godfrey was considerably older.
 The 25th April 1996
was, of course, Anzac Day.  Mr Moffatt told Dr Wong that he and Mr Godfrey
watched the dawn service on television.
 They drank as they did so.  A resident
of a neighbouring flat (number 39), Ms Kelly Findlay, recalled seeing the
accused and Mr
Godfrey on the back verandah.  She put the time at between
8.00am and 8.30 am (T 93).  She believed that the accused was already
drunk.
<P>

5	The accused was in the habit of drinking a mixture of methylated spirits, and
water.  Indeed, such was his consumption, that he
made up the mixture in
plastic cordial bottles.  He then drank from the bottle.  He was seen to do so
by neighbours.  Photographs
taken of the flat shortly after Mr Fyfe's death
reveal the presence of cordial bottles.  Methylated spirits bottles were seen
by
neighbours throughout the flat, often near the front door (T 92).
Methylated spirits is, of course, an especially potent form of
alcohol.  Dr
Perl said this:  (T 111/112)
<P>

	"So these days, probably somewhere around 90 percent ethanol in a bottle of
methylated spirits."
<P>

6	At some point during the day (variously described as mid morning or mid
afternoon) a friend of Mr Godfrey, Mr William Williams,
came to the flat.  Mr
Williams had a 5 litre cask of wine (Ex N(1) Q 65;  T 70).  The drinking
continued.  It was Mr Moffatt's recollection,
when interviewed by police, that
they watched a video.
<P>

<b>The Arrival of the Deceased</b>
<P>

7	The deceased arrived at the flat in the early evening.  Mr Godfrey said it
was still daylight (T 53).  The accused put the time
at between 7.30 pm and
9.00 pm, although he acknowledged that his estimate may be astray, since he was
"not a clock watcher" (Q 75).
<P>

8	Mr Godfrey claimed not to have previously met the deceased.  It is clear,
however, that the deceased had been to the flat before.
 The neighbours
recognised him.  Indeed, they knew him by his name, Richard.  The accused, when
interviewed, told the police that
he recalled having met Richard Fyfe once
before (Q 71).
<P>

9	When the deceased arrived, he was already heavily under the influence of
alcohol.  Mr Moffatt, himself affected by alcohol, described
the deceased as
"about three-quarters pissed after he'd just left the pub" (Q 172).  The
deceased entered the flat.  He joined in
the drinking.  Mr Godfrey said this:
(T 53)
<P>

	"A.	...  I will explain.  The young fellow, he seemed to me to be a decent
young bloke and he came in out of the blue because I
had the door open and we
had a couple of drinks together, the lot of us and he said to me, he said, he
was smoking my cigarettes,
he said I'll go and get a packet of cigarettes and
another cask to square up.
<P>

	Q.	Cask of wine?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did he go and get another cask of wine?
<P>

	A.	Yes."
<P>

10	The accused had the same recollection.  He told Dr Wong the following:  (Ex
J, p 3)
<P>

	"The deceased at first drank what they had got but later went to the pub and
came back with some wine and smoke(s)."
<P>

<b>Argument Between the Accused and the Deceased</b>
<P>

11	The accused, when interviewed by police the following morning, described the
progressive deterioration in his relations with
the deceased.  The deceased
pestered him for a knife, which he had once owned but had given away.  He gave
the following answers
when interviewed:
<P>

	"Q77.	So what happened next?
<P>

	A.	Well, he turned around and he started causing some hassles around the
place, so I picked up the hammer.
<P>

	Q78.	When you say he was causing some hassles.
<P>

	A.	He was causing hassles around the place, he wanted to know where me knife
was and I already got rid of that a long time ago."
<P>

12	Mr Moffatt explained that, at their last meeting, he had shown the deceased
the knife.  His account continued:
<P>

	"A.	Yeah.  And he wanted to know where me knife was, I said, `I got rid of
it'.  And he turned round, kept pushing, pushing and
pushing.
<P>

	Q82.	OK.
<P>

	A.	And I turned around and picked up the hammer, so I ended up smashing the
joint up a little bit, didn't I?  Just a little bit.
<P>

	Q83.	So you didn't hit anyone at this time, you just ...?
<P>

	A.	No, I didn't hit anybody at that time, no, I was just smashing things.
Smashing into chests and smashin' up glasses, bustin'
mirrors.  Just smashin'
the place up.
<P>

	Q84.	OK.
<P>

	A.	You know, because all he wanted to know was where my knife was.
<P>

	Q85.	All right.
<P>

	A.	And I turned round and told him, `I haven't got me bloody knife here,' I
said, `I'm not gunna tell you this for the last time,'
and then he turned
around and he called me a dog.  So I grabbed him by the throat once, right, and
then Billy and the old fella pulled
me off, right.  I grabbed him by the throat
once and I said, `Don't ever call me a dog again.' ..."
<P>

13	Mr Moffatt's account is consistent with accounts he later gave to a number
of doctors.  On 16 September 1998, Mr Moffatt told
Dr Wong the following:  (Ex
J, p 4)
<P>

	"There was an argument when the deceased kept asking him about a knife which
was given to him by a friend but which he had given
away.  The deceased called
Mr Moffatt a dog."
<P>

14	He added:
<P>

	"He took a hammer and `smashed up the flat' and broke Ron's glassware."
<P>

15	Mr Moffatt's account to Dr Strum (Ex 2, p 9), was less expansive, though not
inconsistent.
<P>

16	Mr Godfrey remembered the accused breaking glass ornaments, and a mirror his
mother had given him (T 55).  The photographs taken
by the police show a broken
mirror (Ex C, photo 3), and broken ornaments (Ex C, photo 13).  The neighbours,
Ms Keane and Ms Findlay,
remember hearing "yelling and thumping" and the
smashing of glass (Keane T 61-62; Findlay T 82).  They fixed the time at about
midnight,
or shortly before.
<P>

17	Ms Findlay was sufficiently disturbed to investigate the noise.  She walked
along the corridor to the accused's flat.  The door
was slightly open.  She
remembered hearing the words, "Get him Tony".  She retreated to her flat.
There was silence for a further
10 to 15 minutes (T 85).
<P>

18	Mr Moffatt's account to the police suggests that he was insulted by the
deceased for a second time.  He was called a "mutt" which,
of course, is
another word for a dog.  When first describing what occurred, Mr Moffatt
appears to have telescoped the two insults,
so that they followed one upon
another.  The relevant part of his interview is as follows:
<P>

	"A85. ...  I grabbed him by the throat once and I said, `Don't ever call me a
dog again.'  So I sat back down there and he turned
around and he said, `You're
still a mutt.'  Bang, that was it.  I hit him on this side of the, the left
hand side with the hammer.
 I hit him in the middle of the chest with the
hammer and I hit him on the right hand side with the hammer and then I grabbed
him
by the throat and I just did not let go."
<P>

19	The police, in later questioning, sought to clarify the precise sequence.
The interview is in these terms:
<P>

	"Q130.	 How much later was the second time that you put your hands round his
throat?
<P>

	A.	I don't know, about three quarters of an hour, I'd say."
<P>

20	The second attack, as I will shortly describe, culminated in the death of Mr
Fyfe.  Immediately after the attack, Mr Moffatt
left his flat and approached
his neighbours in flat 39.  It is clear from the evidence of these neighbours
that there was a short
interval, perhaps 15 minutes, between the first incident
(after the deceased had called Mr Moffatt a "dog"), and the second (after
he
had been called a "mutt").
<P>

<b>The Final Assault</b>
<P>

21	Having been called a "mutt", the accused attacked Mr Fyfe.  It appears that
there were two stages to the attack:
<P>

&#183;	First, the accused struck Mr Fyfe with a hammer.
<P>

&#183;	He then placed his hands around the throat of Mr Fyfe, and began
strangling him.
<P>

22	Dealing with the first stage, the accused told police that he repeatedly
struck the deceased on the chest with the flat part
of a claw hammer (Q 90, Q
150).  He gave the following answers to the police:
<P>

	"A160. But I heard a lot of cracks.
<P>

	Q161.  All right.
<P>

	A.	`Cause I didn't hit him soft."
<P>

23	Mr Moffatt did not see blood, except his own blood on the handle of the
hammer.  A claw hammer (Ex E) was found at the premises.
 The police showed the
hammer to Mr Moffatt in the course of the interview.  Before it was produced,
Mr Moffatt accurately described
it.  He said this:
<P>

	"A145.  I recognise the hammer, it's got a black handle, with little serrated
holes in it and, I'll know the hammer, as soon as
you show it to me ...
<P>

	Q146.  I'll just show you ...
<P>

	A.	That's the one.
<P>

	Q.	... a black handled hammer now, is that, is that the hammer that you're
talking about?
<P>

	A.	That's the hammer I hit him with.
<P>

	Q147.  There's just some hair and things on the claw part of the hammer, do
you know ...
<P>

	A.	Probably his, I'm not sure."
<P>

24	The findings on post mortem were entirely consistent with this account.
There was significant bruising across the chest of the
deceased.  However, Mr
Fyfe had not bled externally.  The blood on the hammer was, as Mr Moffatt
surmised, his own.  It was not that
of the deceased (Ex L).  Mr Byron Collins,
pathologist, gave the following evidence:  (T 208)
<P>

	"Q.	If that hammer was indeed the implement that caused the fractures of the
deceased's fifth and sixth ribs, the force that the
hammer struck the ribs with
to cause the fractures, would you expect that force to again have an audible
crack as the ribs break?
<P>

	A.	Yes, it may well do.  The rib is bone and could certainly crack."
<P>

25	Having struck Mr Fyfe with the hammer, Mr Moffatt threw it away (Q 91).  He
placed his hands around the throat of Mr Fyfe, and
proceeded to strangle him.
He estimated that he had his hands around his throat for one and half to two
minutes.  The accused described
what occurred in these words:
<P>

	"A100.  His tongue was goin' blue while I was strangling him.
<P>

	Q101.  All right.
<P>

	A.	The only thing was he couldn't push me away.
<P>

	Q102.  He couldn't push you away?  He ...
<P>

	A.	No, no, when I'm coming in on top of somebody, I'm not easy, I'm not an
easy thing to push away.
<P>

	Q103.  So he was trying to push you off him?
<P>

	A.	He was trying to, but it didn't work."
<P>

26	The process culminated in an audible crack from the deceased's neck, and
then apparent lifelessness.  Mr Moffatt said this:
<P>

	"Q92.	OK.  How long did you hold him around the throat for?
<P>

	A.	Wouldn't have been any more than a minute and a half, two minutes.  Then I
... you know, where my hands were around him, my
fingers were down there like
that and my hands were around him, I just went, I just went crack and that was
it, he was dead."
<P>

27	In the same interview, the accused, having identified the hammer, said
this:
<P>

	"A168.  And that's the hammer I used.  But I hit him with the flat.  Flat on
the left, flat in the middle and flat on the right
side, then I put me hands
around his throat and I just didn't let go until he stopped breathing.  Looks
like I went a little bit
overboard, didn't I?"
<P>

28	Towards the end of the interview, the following was said:
<P>

	"Q191.  Tony, is there anything else that you want to tell me about what's
happened?
<P>

	A.	No, only the fact was, yeah, I hit him with the hammer and I choked him to
death, that's all."
<P>

29	The accused also said this:
<P>

	"Q183.  Did he ever go to sleep?
<P>

	A.	No.
<P>

	Q184.  From the time you got there until, up until this happened?
<P>

	A.	No.
<P>

	Q185.  He never dozed off?
<P>

	A.	No, the only time he went (to) sleep was when I put him there
permanent."
<P>

30	After hearing the crack in the neck, the final moments were described by Mr
Moffatt in these words:
<P>

	"A92.	... where my hands were around him, my fingers were down there like that
and my hands were around him, I just went, I just
went crack and that was it,
he was dead.
<P>

	Q93.	How do you know ...
<P>

	A.	Nothing much I could do after that.
<P>

	Q94.	How did you know he was dead?
<P>

	A.	His eyes rolled back in his head and his tongue turned blue.  And he wasn't
breathing.
<P>

	Q95.	Was that ...
<P>

	A.	Couldn't feel no pulse in his neck.
<P>

	Q96.	Was that before you let go of him or afterwards that his eyes rolled
back.
<P>

	A.	It was after I let go of him.
<P>

	Q97.	So you heard a crack and you let go of him?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q98.	His eyes rolled back then?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q99.	And his tongue started to go blue?
<P>

	A.	And his tongue went blue."
<P>

31	Mr Moffatt added:
<P>

	"Q104.  Right.  After you said you let go of him, did you check for his pulse,
did you say?
<P>

	A.	Yeah, I did, on his neck.
<P>

	Q105.  And could you feel any?
<P>

	A.	Nuh.  I even put a mirror, or a busted piece of glass to his face like
that, but he wasn't breathing.
<P>

	Q106.  Right.
<P>

	A.	So I knew he was dead.  So I didn't know what to do."
<P>

32	There was, as mentioned, a broken mirror in the flat.  The autopsy confirmed
various aspects of Mr Moffatt's account.  First,
there was extensive bruising,
and some abrasions, to the neck.  Secondly, there was an oblique fracture
running through the left
side of the thyroid cartilage.  In respect of the
latter, Dr Lawrence (who performed the autopsy) said this:  (T 12)
<P>

	 "Q.	If the accused in his account to police described hearing a crack as at
the time that he had his hands around the neck of
the deceased can you account
for any observation that you made that might be consistent with the accused
hearing a crack?
<P>

	A.	It is consistent with the fracture in the thyroid cartilage."
<P>

33	Dr Byron Collins provided the following evidence, based upon the actions of
the accused, as demonstrated in the recorded interview:
 (T 206/207)
<P>

	"Q.	I appreciate you haven't had the opportunity to see it, but if you would
assume that in the course of the police interview
with Mr Moffatt, he
demonstrated a motion that he applied to the neck of the deceased and he had
his thumbs separated but on an angle,
say a 45 degree angle (indicating)?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	If force was applied to each side of the neck in that manner ...
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	... and the force supplied by someone who was right-handed, that would
place the thumb on the left side of the thyroid cartilage?
<P>

	A.	It may do."
<P>

34	Dr Collins added:  (T 207)
<P>

	"Q.	When an oblique fracture of the thyroid cartilage occurs does it produce a
crack or an audible break?
<P>

	A.	It may do.  It's - the thyroid cartilage in this particular case appeared
to me from - as it did to Dr Lawrence, from the microscopy
to be largely
cartilaginous, so that is gristle that you might see on the end of a chop bone
or that sort of an area, but there were
some areas of boney formation or
degeneration through that cartilage which is a product of ageing and yes, that
could produce a crack.
<P>

	Q.	That would be a more brittle structure?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	And may well produce an audible crack that someone very close would
hear?
<P>

	A.	Well, that would be one explanation for a crack, yes."
<P>

35	Dr Collins, nonetheless, thought it unusual that other delicate structures
in the near vicinity of the thyroid cartilage had
not been damaged.  The
fracture of the thyroid cartilage in isolation would more commonly be
attributed to a direct blow to the throat
(T 200).
<P>

36	Drs Lawrence and Collins each gave evidence concerning the symptoms observed
by the accused in Mr Fyfe shortly before his death.
 Dr Lawrence said this:  (T
12)
<P>

	"Q.	I will just paraphrase.  I you could assume that there will be evidence in
this trial that the following morning, the morning
after the death of Mr Fyfe,
the accused gave a version to police that as at the time that he had his hands
around the neck of the
deceased, the deceased's tongue appeared to go blue and
his eyes appeared to roll back, do you attach any significance to those
observations,
if indeed they be accurate and reliable?
<P>

	A.	It appears to be a description of somebody being strangled to the point of
unconsciousness."
<P>

37	The symptoms having been described, Dr Collins gave the following evidence:
(T 214)
<P>

	"Q.	... what does that indicate to you, Doctor?
<P>

	A.	Well, it indicates that he is not well basically, he has lost control of
his musculature and his eyes and that sort of finding
is commonly seen in all
sorts of unconscious states and people who are immediately preceding death.
Again in people who may well
recover from whatever event has produced it.  It
is a non-specific finding basically, they don't indicate anything with any
degree
of certainty except that his cerebral and musculature functions and
cardiac functions are compromised.
<P>

	Q.	If those functions were compromised at precisely the moment that the neck
was being compressed, does that suggest a cause and
effect nexus?
<P>

	A.	Well, I think we have already discussed that and I have said yes, but I -
to a certain extent, but I can't separate them out
as to what it might be,
whether it is the neck situation, asphyxia, true asphyxia, the carotid sinus
stimulation or his cardiac problems.
 You know, it is quite possible that this
man, despite the fact that somebody's hanging on his neck and we don't know how
hard, had
a cardiac arrest separately and we can't sort that out."
<P>

38	When the ambulance officer arrived at the flat, he noticed the deceased had
a blue tinge around his face (T 156).
<P>

<b>The Accused's Intent</b>
<P>

39	In the course of the police interview, the following questions were asked of
the accused:
<P>

	"Q107.  When you had his, your hands around his throat ...
<P>

	A.	Yeah.
<P>

	Q.	... what were you trying to do to him?
<P>

	A.	Just shut him up, for calling me a dog and a mutt.  Just, you know, `Don't
say that sorta thing,' you know."
<P>

40	The police returned to this issue later in the interview.  The interview
included the following:
<P>

	"Q115.  All right.  What did you think was going to happen to him if you kept,
if you kept your hands around his throat like that?
<P>

	A.	I was gunna kill him, that's what I went out to do, kill him, and I
succeeded, didn't I."
<P>

41	A blood sample was taken from the accused by Dr Moynham at 8.00 am.  The
blood alcohol level of the accused was 0.18 grams/100
mls (Ex K).  Upon that
basis, it is possible to calculate the likely blood alcohol level at about
12.15/12.30 am, being the approximate
time of the incident.  Dr Moynham made
that calculation.  Because rates of elimination vary, the result must be
expressed as a range
of figures.  Dr Moynham calculated that Mr Moffatt's blood
alcohol reading at the time of the alleged offence would have been in
the range
of 0.277 to 0.375 grams/100 mls (T 96).  On the assumption, which appears
reasonable (cf Q 132), that Mr Moffatt and the
deceased had continued drinking
until shortly before the incident, Mr Moffatt's blood alcohol level was likely
to be towards the
lower end of the range, according to Dr Perl (T 97), whose
evidence I accept.
<P>

42	Even the lower figure is, by ordinary standards, a high level of
intoxication.  However, the ability of Mr Moffatt to function,
whilst affected
by alcohol, cannot be measured by ordinary standards.  Because he was an
alcoholic, used to regular heavy drinking,
he had developed significant
tolerance to alcohol.  The body is able to adapt to extremely high
concentrations of alcohol (T 95).
 Some indication of Mr Moffatt's level of
tolerance is provided by the video interview.  Dr Moynham estimated that Mr
Moffatt's blood
alcohol concentration at the time of that interview (6.15 am)
as being in the range of 0.206 to 0.232 grams/100 mls (T 99).  Yet,
Mr Moffatt
appeared throughout the interview to be remarkably lucid.  Dr Perl did not
believe his cognition was significantly impaired
(T 98).
<P>

43	Murder is a crime of specific intent.  The Crown must demonstrate that,
notwithstanding the level of intoxication, the accused
intended to kill the
deceased, or inflict grievous bodily harm.  Mr Moffatt, in the passage
extracted, said to the police that he
intended to kill Mr Fyfe.  His actions
would suggest that he did so.  Two matters, however, may indicate something
less than an intention
to kill.  First, Mr Moffatt used the flat part of the
hammer, rather than the head.  The head was likely to do more damage,
penetrating
its target.  Secondly, Mr Moffatt struck the deceased on the chest.
He might just as easily have aimed at the head, producing greater
harm.  On
balance, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Moffatt intended to
kill Mr Fyfe. However, I am satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused
intended to inflict grievous bodily harm.
<P>

<b>The Role of Messrs Godfrey and Williams</b>
<P>

44	Mr Godfrey and Mr Williams both asserted that they were asleep, drunk,
during what I have termed the "final assault" (T 54 and
T 71).
<P>

45	A neighbour, Ms Kelly Findlay, who entered the flat soon after Mr Fyfe's
death, recalled a conversation with Mr Godfrey.  Mr
Godfrey indicated that he
would tell the police (as he told this Court) that he did not know the
deceased.  According to Ms Findlay,
Mr Godfrey said this:  (T 92)
<P>

	"Q.	Ronnie said something like, `If I tell the truth I'll get in trouble
anyway because I clobbered the guy over the head with
a lump of wood'?
<P>

	A.	That's right."
<P>

46	Upon the basis of that evidence, the following questions were put to Mr
Godfrey:  (T 58)
<P>

	"Q.	Some time after the glass was smashed up, did you have an argument with
the man who finished up dead?
<P>

	A.	As I told you, he was a nice young bloke and he had caused no trouble, he
was quite welcome to be there with me and my mates,
whatever.
<P>

	Q.	You didn't get angry with him and hit him with a hammer or a stick or
something?
<P>

	A.	You have got to be joking, I would never kill.  I have shot rats and I have
shot snakes and I always taught my boy, don't kill
anything you can't eat,
right.
<P>

	Q.	I'm not saying that you killed him, I am just saying that you might have
hit him with a stick or a hammer?
<P>

	A.	No, there was nothing like that at all because he was just having a few
drinks with me and a smoke like me other friends do.
 Some come and go all the
time."
<P>

47	There is no evidence that the death of Mr Fyfe was caused by his being
struck with a lump of wood.  Indeed, neither Dr Lawrence,
nor Dr Collins,
thought that the blows to the chest of Mr Fyfe (which were consistent with the
hammer) were a likely cause of his
death (T 199).  Further, the accused made
the following statement to Sgt Hazlewood at 4.45 am, referring to Messrs
Godfrey and Williams
(T 118)
<P>

	"The old guys were pissed and they don't know Jack shit."
<P>

48	When the accused was interviewed later the same morning (the ERISP tape), he
provided the following answers, referring to the
interval between, what I have
termed, the first insult (when he was called a "dog") and the second (when he
was called a "mutt"):
<P>

	"A132.	 Yeah, well, we were sitting up drinkin', him and me, right?
<P>

	Q133.  Yeah.
<P>

	A.	Then the old fella and Billy were, they were, you know, they were passed
out, you know, and he turned around and just called
me a mutt for the second
time and I wouldn't accept it."
<P>

49	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has excluded the
actions of Messrs Godfrey and Williams as being implicated
in the death of Mr
Fyfe.
<P>

<b>After the Attack</b>
<P>

50	Having checked for Mr Fyfe's pulse, and having placed a mirror to his mouth,
and in each case found nothing, Mr Moffatt, in his
own words, "panicked" (A
135).  Mr Godfrey, by this time, was awake.  He suggested to Mr Moffatt that he
should pack a bag and leave.
 However, Mr Moffatt went down the corridor to
flat 39.  He sought their help.  One of the occupants, Ms Jodie Keane, recalled
Mr
Moffatt saying these words:  (T 64)
<P>

	"You have to help me, I've killed someone."
<P>

51	Mr Moffatt added:  (T 64)
<P>

	"I'm really sorry.  I didn't want yous to see this side of me.  It shouldn't
have happened."
<P>

52	Mr Moffatt appeared very upset.  He said to Ms Keane that the deceased had
called him a dog (T 65).
<P>

53	Another occupant of the same flat, Ms Findlay, remembered the conversation
in these terms:  (T 85)
<P>

	"Q.	Did he say something?
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>A.	Yes, he was very upset and he said that he thought he'd just
strangled a guy and he was dead."
<P>

54	The third occupant, Mr Both, recalled Mr Moffatt saying that he thought he
had just "killed a bloke" (T 151).
<P>

55	The group went to flat 41.  They checked the pulse of the deceased, and
found none.  They even attempted mouth to mouth resuscitation
(T 151).
However, Mr Fyfe was dead.
<P>

56	Mr Moffatt, in these circumstances, said to the gathering (as each
recollected) words to the following effect:  (T 68)
<P>

	"I'm going to the Seven Eleven to get some smokes and hand myself in."
<P>

57	Each remembered Mr Moffatt as having been extremely drunk.  Mr Both gave the
following evidence:  (T 153)
<P>

	"Q.	When Tony Moffatt talked he appeared to be hysterical?
<P>

	A.	Yes, they were very I'd say incoherent.  He didn't understand what
happened.  He just didn't know what he'd done."
<P>

58	Mr Moffatt's flat was on the third floor of the building.  Mr Both assisted
him down the stairs.  He described that journey in
these terms:  (T 155)
<P>

	"Q.	How was he as you walked down?
<P>

	A.	Staggering, he held onto me for support."
<P>

<b>The Arrest of the Accused</b>
<P>

59	The accused then walked towards the Police Station.  At 12.55 am he was
observed with two males sitting on the side of the road,
adjacent to the Police
Station.  Sgt Hazlewood then asked the three males to accompany him to the
station, which was a few metres
away.  Mr Moffatt was then detained.  The other
two males were released.  At 3.45 am, Sgt Hazlewood had the following
conversation
with the accused:  (T 117)
<P>

	"Well, I killed him because he called me a dog and the two other old cunts had
nothing to do with it.  They're both in their 60s
and I am 36.  It was no
problem.  I am taking it on the chin.  I killed him, I just choked him and
snapped his neck."
<P>

60	Later, Mr Moffatt repeated the same thing to Sgt Hazlewood at 4.45 am.  He
said this:  (T 118)
<P>

	"I hit him with a hammer to the chest and put my hands around his throat and
killed him.  The old guys were pissed and they don't
know Jack shit.  Well,
I'll do a lot of time, years over this one."
<P>

61	This conversation was not put to the accused when the ERISP was undertaken,
nor adopted by him.  No objection was taken to Sgt
Hazlewood's evidence at the
time it was given, although objection was made after the conclusion of the
evidence.  The evidence may
be admissible under s 424A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>,
or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  However, objection having been taken by
Counsel for the accused, the Crown did not press this evidence as an admission
by Mr Moffatt.
 I will therefore not so regard it.  It is, however, admissible
for another purpose.  There is an issue of confabulation (to which
reference
will be made shortly).  It is relevant to that issue.  It is yet another
account by the accused, consistent with accounts
given before and after.
<P>

62	Later the same morning the accused spoke to Sgt Jones, who had taken charge
of the case.  The conversation was recorded by Sgt
Jones in his notebook.  It
was later read to the accused, when he was interviewed on video tape.  The
notebook was signed.  It included
the following:
<P>

	"Q45.	... Then you said to me, `Well, I hit on the chest with the hammer and
put me hands around his ...'
<P>

	A.	On the left hand side, the middle and the right hand side.
<P>

	Q46.  Did you?  All right.  You said that and then you said, `Put your hands
round my throat because he called me a dog.'
<P>

	A.	That's right."
<P>

63	I accept that the accused made these statements.
<P>

<b>The Reliability of the Accused's Account</b>
<P>

64	Two issues were raised in respect of the police interview, the ERISP tape.
The issues are related.
<P>

&#183;	First, has the Crown excluded beyond reasonable doubt the possibility of
confabulation?
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, even if the interview is not fantasy, can it be relied upon
for the purposes of such issues as causation?
<P>

65	Dealing with the first issue, Dr Wong, a psychiatrist, believed that it was
unlikely that Mr Moffatt's account to the police
was invented, that is, that it
was confabulation.  First, although Mr Moffatt during the police interview was
intoxicated (according
to his blood alcohol level), and although a person who
is intoxicated is rather more likely to confabulate or exaggerate, it is
evident
from the interview that Mr Moffatt had developed significant tolerance
to alcohol.  He did not manifest signs of intoxication.  When
he signed the
notebook, his hand did not shake.  His speech was not slurred.
<P>

66	Secondly, Mr Moffatt's account is corroborated by witnesses who were
apparently sober, and by other evidence.
<P>

67	Thirdly, the accounts given by the accused, both contemporaneously and since
his incarceration, are consistent.  Immediately
after the incident, Mr Moffatt
spoke to neighbours.  Some hours later he spoke to Sgt Hazlewood and Det Sgt
Jones.  He was then interviewed
on video (the ERISP tape).  The fundamentals of
each version are the same, although they differ in the level of detail.  Mr
Fyfe
called him a dog.  The accused attacked Mr Fyfe with a hammer.  He then
strangled him to the point of apparent lifelessness.  He
believed that he had
killed him.  The accounts he gave much later to Doctors Wong and Strum are not
dissimilar, although incomplete.
<P>

68	I accept that the Crown, in these circumstances, has excluded
confabulation.
<P>

69	Turning to the second issue, how reliable is the account of the accused?
Specifically, is the Court able to rely upon his description
of the sequence,
and the timing of each aspect in that sequence?  The written submissions, made
on behalf of the accused, make the
point in these words:
<P>

	"But as a matter of common sense, the more intoxicated the person the less
accurate the version of events that the person will
give.  Drunks are not
reliable witnesses."
<P>

70	The submissions point to a number of matters.  They demonstrate, so it is
claimed, the unreliability of Mr Moffatt's account.
 First, the accused's
account is inherently implausible.  The accused asserted that he murdered
someone who was almost a complete
stranger.  He described a reaction to insult
which was a gross over-reaction.
<P>

71	Secondly, the accused described an argument concerning a knife.  Yet, it is
suggested, the accused had disposed of the knife
before Mr Moffatt met the
deceased for the first time.  Question 78 in the interview is said to
demonstrate that fact.
<P>

72	Thirdly, it is said that the accused's version to the police in the ERISP
tape is confused and contradictory.  His first account
of the incident (Q 81 to
Q 85), where the insults follow one upon another, does not sit comfortably with
his later account where
they are separated by three-quarters of an hour (Q 128
to Q 133).  Certain aspects of Mr Moffatt's account are said to be
improbable.
<P>

73	Fourthly, the accused described Mr Fyfe at the time of his arrival as "three
quarters pissed" (Q 172).  Mr Fyfe, some hours later,
at the time of his death,
was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.48 grams/100 mls.  Plainly, even
at the time of his arrival,
he was in an advanced state of intoxication.
<P>

74	Each professional witness who saw the ERISP tape was struck, as I was, by Mr
Moffatt's lucidity, and the consistency of his answers.
 Dr Perl saw the
explanation as the accused's extreme tolerance to alcohol, arising from his
prolonged heavy drinking (T 96).  His
answers were rational, and responsive (T
98).  He appeared to comprehend the questions put to him.  The answers he
provided were
appropriate.  His memory appeared unimpaired (T 100).
<P>

75	Dr Wong drew attention to particular answers which demonstrated the level of
Mr Moffatt's comprehension.  He sought clarification
of some questions (for
instance, Q 23).  He was prepared to disagree with the version put to him (Q
86/87).  He anticipated, correctly,
questions which the police were
endeavouring to ask (Q 27).  It is plain from his responses that he was not
reacting in a perfunctory
manner.  He was able to accurately paraphrase the
standard caution given by police.  He corrected a mistake by the police
concerning
his flat number.  He provided the level of his pension benefits,
accurate to the cent.
<P>

76	Dr Strum provided the following opinion:  (T 227)
<P>

	"Q.	Are you able to express any view as to his ability at that time - and
bearing in mind that quantity of intoxication - to make
a choice as to whether
or not he should speak or remain silent?
<P>

	A.	I saw the interview, I haven't seen it for some time but I was impressed
that it was, you know, it didn't indicate to me anything
in the way of
abnormality and I can't see any reason why he would not have been able to
choose that, to make that interview."
<P>

77	Turning to submissions made on behalf of the accused, it is convenient to
deal with the first three arguments together.  For
my part, I do not find the
account of Mr Moffatt implausible.  Indeed, I find the reverse.  It is plain
that Mr Moffatt had met Mr
Fyfe previously.  He had, apparently, shown him a
knife which he used to own.  There is no warrant from inferring from his answer
to question 78 that Mr Moffatt had disposed of the knife before their first
meeting.  Far from being confused and contradictory,
Mr Moffatt, in my
judgment, appears lucid and consistent.
<P>

78	There are three respects in which Mr Moffatt's answers may be unreliable.
First, his assessment of the level of intoxication
of Mr Fyfe was clearly awry.
However, that is perhaps not surprising.  It is the assessment by one alcoholic
of another.  Their yardstick
of normality is not that of the ordinary citizen.
Secondly, Mr Moffatt in his answer to question 92, does telescope the two
insults.
 Again that is not surprising.  Each insult was essentially the same.
The second was the more provocative because of the first. 
The two incidents
were, in other words, connected in Mr Moffatt's mind.  To me it is unremarkable
that he should mention both together.
 Thirdly, Mr Moffatt's estimate of the
time between the first insult (signified by the shattering of the glass), and
the second,
namely three-quarters of an hour, would appear to be wrong.  The
interval was more likely ten to fifteen minutes.  That, in my judgement,
does
not render Mr Moffatt's account unreliable.
<P>

79	There is substantial corroboration for the account given by Mr Moffatt.  Mr
Moffatt described the way in which he reacted to
Mr Fyfe's pestering concerning
the knife.  He broke a number of glass ornaments, and a mirror.  There were
broken ornaments, and
a broken mirror in the flat when the police arrived.
They were photographed.  The photographs form part of Exhibit C.  Mr Moffatt
claimed to have used a black claw hammer to strike the deceased on the chest.
Such a hammer was found at the flat.  The chest injuries
of Mr Fyfe were
consistent with having been inflicted by that hammer.  The accused said that he
heard cracking.  The injuries to
Mr Fyfe included broken ribs.  According to
the medical evidence, you could expect to hear ribs crack in the circumstances
described
by Mr Moffatt.  Mr Moffatt said that he did not draw blood from Mr
Fyfe.  He insisted that certain blood on the hammer came from
him.  The post
mortem, and the blood analysis undertaken in respect of the hammer, support his
assertions.  Mr Moffatt said that
he took hold of the deceased around the
throat.  There was bruising to the throat, consistent with his having done so.
He said that
he strangled Mr Fyfe until he heard a crack.  The autopsy revealed
a fracture to the thyroid cartilage.  Such a fracture, when inflicted
manually,
could be expected to produce a crack.  Mr Moffatt claimed to have checked
whether Mr Fyfe was breathing by placing a piece
of broken mirror, or glass, in
front of him.  There was, as mentioned, both broken mirror and glass in the
flat.  Mr Moffatt said
that after Mr Fyfe appeared lifeless, he left the flat.
He sought the assistance of neighbours.  His neighbours confirmed that he
did
so.  Mr Moffatt said that he would buy some cigarettes, and give himself up to
the police.  He was arrested metres away from
the Police Station, sitting by
the side of the road.
<P>

80	In assessing the evidence, and reaching the views I have expressed, I have
been conscious of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s165.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 165</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, relating to the warnings to
be given to a jury, where the matter proceeds before a jury.  Much, indeed most
of the evidence against
the accused is in the nature of admission (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s165.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
165(1)(a)).</a>  However, these were not admissions which were denied by the
accused.  Rather, the issue was whether they may be fantasy (confabulation),
or
unreliable by reason of his intoxication.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s165.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 165(1)(c)</a> specifically deals
with evidence which may be unreliable by reason of ill-health (mental of
physical) or such matters.  I take that
phrase to include alcoholism, and the
level of intoxication of the accused at the time he was interviewed.  In making
my findings,
I have been conscious of these warnings.
<P>

81	I am nonetheless persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the account given by
Mr Moffatt to the police is, except in the minor
respects which I have
identified, reliable.
<P>

<b>The Issue of Causation</b>
<P>

82	Dr Lawrence, having performed the post mortem, provided a medical
certificate to the Coroner.  He identified the direct causes
of death in these
terms:  (Ex A)
<P>

	"Combined effects of compression of the neck, blunt force chest injury &amp;
acute ethanol intoxication."
<P>

83	Dr Lawrence's report also described the following, under the heading, "Other
significant conditions contributing to the death
but not relating to the
disease or condition causing it":  (Ex A)
<P>

	"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"
<P>

84	The determination of the cause of death, based purely upon the autopsy
findings, was clearly a puzzle.  There were indications
of strangulation.
There was bruising to the neck and abrasions.  There was an oblique fracture to
the thyroid cartilage.  Yet there
were also odd features.  In strangulation the
veins of the neck and head are occluded.  There is a pressure build-up which
tends
to transmit its forces to the small delicate blood vessel walls around
the eyes, creating what are referred to as petechial haemorrhages.
 Here, there
was no convincing evidence of petechial haemorrhaging.  It is unusual but
possible to have strangulation without petechial
haemorrhages.  Dr Byron
Collins suggested a mechanism that may well furnish an explanation for their
absence.  He said this:  (T
209)
<P>

	"... where the death is not related to asphyxiation at all but to one of the
neck structures, one of the structures in the neck,
of the carotid artery and
that is the carotid sinus and that is an area in the arterial wall which is
sensitive to stimulation which
is connected with a number of autonomic nerves
within the body and particularly in this case, the vagus nerve which, if
stimulated,
can slow the heart.  Now this is certainly one mechanism in manual
strangulation or the touching of somebody's neck where they die
and it can
produce a very sudden slowing and catastrophic slowing of the heart."
<P>

85	There is no doubt that the deceased suffered from advanced coronary artery
disease.  One of the major arteries to the heart was
narrowed 75 percent (T
16).  Had there been no suggestion of trauma to Mr Fyfe, this condition would
have furnished an acceptable
cause of death.  A person whose heart is
compromised to that degree is liable to drop dead, without warning symptoms.
There was also
evidence of the deceased having previously suffered a myocardial
infarction, or heart attack.
<P>

86	The accused must, of course, take his victim as he finds him.  The issue is
whether Mr Moffatt, by his actions, accelerated the
death of Mr Fyfe.  Dr
Lawrence said this:  (T 16/17)
<P>

	"Q	Would sudden compression of the neck and forceful application of blows to
the chest contribute or accelerate such a dropping
dead?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Would you expect that someone who had that cardiovascular disease to that
degree, that if they did suffer a compression of the
neck so as to fracture the
thyroid cartilage and immediately preceding that sustained three blows to the
chest that caused rib fractures,
would you expect that to accelerate death in
someone who had such a cardiac disease?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I would expect it."
<P>

87	Dr Byron Collins' view was no different.  He said:  (T 213)
<P>

	"... then somebody who has a pre-existing heart condition such as coronary
artery disease and the blood supply is already compromised
because of that
situation and then it is further compromised, particularly the oxygen content
thereof, by stopping the person from
breathing properly, then yes, that would
increase the likelihood of that person having an abnormal cardiac rhythm and
even a fatal
cardiac arrhythmial."
<P>

88	The deceased, as mentioned, had a blood alcohol level of 0.48 grams/100 mls
at the time of his death.  In a heavy drinker, who
has developed tolerance, a
blood alcohol level of 0.5 grams/100 mls is regarded as approaching a lethal
level.  However, there is
considerable variation between individuals, depending
upon their make-up, and drinking history.
<P>

89	Where a person dies from the effects of a lethal dose of alcohol,  they may
either lapse into a coma, or may irritate the heart,
causing sudden arrhythmia
and death.
<P>

90	It was submitted, on behalf of the accused, that, given the complexity of
the medical conditions from which the deceased suffered,
as revealed by the
autopsy, the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the
actions of the accused which caused
death.  Put another way, the Crown had not
excluded as possibilities, which may be regarded as unreasonable or irrational,
that Mr
Fyfe had died as a consequence of alcoholic poisoning, or a spontaneous
unrelated heart attack (cf <b><i>Puckeridge v The Queen</i></b> (CCA,
unreported, 3 November 1998)).
<P>

91	The High Court in <b><i>Royall v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20172%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 172 CLR 378</a>, made
a number of observations upon the issue of causation.  Mason CJ, Deane and
Dawson JJ, and Gaudron and Toohey JJ each cited,
with approval, the comments of
Burt CJ in <b><i>Campbell v The Queen</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20WAR%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) WAR 286</a>, where the
following was said:  (at 290)
<P>

	"(It is) enough if juries [are] told that the question of cause for them to
decide is not a philosophical or a scientific question,
but a question to be
determined by them applying their common sense to the facts as they find them,
they appreciating that the purpose
of the inquiry is to attribute legal
responsibility in a criminal matter."
<P>

92	The judgments of individual members of the Court differ in their formulation
of the test to be applied.  Brennan J believed that
the accused's act or
omission "must contribute significantly to the death of the victim" (at 398).
Deane and Dawson JJ said that
it would be sufficient if the accused's conduct
"is a substantial or significant cause of death" (at 411).  The "causal
connection
must be sufficiently substantial to enable responsibility for the
crime to be attributed to the accused" (at 412).  Toohey and Gaudron
JJ
believed the jury will inevitably concentrate its attention upon "whether the
act of the accused substantially contributed to
the death" (at 423).  McHugh J
believed that the wrongful act must be "an operating cause and a substantial
cause" (at 444).
<P>

93	The possibility was raised, in the examination of witnesses, that perhaps
because of his level of intoxication, the accused did
not observe the collapse
of Mr Fyfe, and his death (from alcohol or an unrelated heart attack), so that
the injuries which Mr Moffatt
may have inflicted were inflicted after death.
<P>

94	There are, however, a number of difficulties with that suggestion.  First,
it is of course contrary to the account given by Mr
Moffatt to his neighbours,
to Sgt Hazlewood, to Sgt Jones, and ultimately in the recorded interview, all
of which are entirely consistent
with each other.
<P>

95	Secondly, the accused described the deceased before the attack in these
words:
<P>

	"Q179.  Did, did he complain before you did, you choked him and everything,
did he complain of being crook or anything, or was
he, was he OK?
<P>

	A.	No, he was fine, he was ...
<P>

	Q180.  ...
<P>

	A.	Yeah, he was drinkin' piss as much as what I was.
<P>

	Q181.  Right.  But he was all right?
<P>

	A.	Yeah, he was all right as far as I know.
<P>

	Q182.  He didn't complain to you about anything?
<P>

	A.	No.  Not that I know of."
<P>

96	Thirdly, one of the findings on autopsy was haemo-aspiration.  There was a
lot of blood in the upper airway.  Dr Lawrence said
this:  (T 11)
<P>

	"Q.	Now does the observation of haemo-aspiration, does that suggest to you
that at the time the ribs were fractured that the deceased
was still alive?
<P>

	A.	Yes, to breathe in the blood you would need to be making chest
movement."
<P>

97	Fourthly, the account of the accused included a description of Mr Fyfe
attempting to push him away in the course of the strangulation.
 Plainly, Mr
Fyfe was alive at that point.
<P>

98	The report provided by Dr Lawrence included the following:  (Ex A, p 10)
<P>

	"Based on reports from individuals present at the time, there is a temporal
relationship between the injuries and death.  Further,
it is reported that the
victim was talking and making purposeful movements prior to the assault."
<P>

99	Dr Lawrence, in re-examination by the Crown, gave the following evidence,
which I accept:  (T 50)
<P>

	"Q.	If you assume that whilst the accused was being throttled, as my friend
puts to you, that he tried to push the assailant off
and that at that stage
there was a crack, the eyes rolled and the tongue turned blue and at a very
short time after that, the assailant
checked for pulse and checked for
breathing and both were absent?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Does that suggest that there is a temporal link between the compression of
the neck and the death?
<P>

	A.	Yes, it does.
<P>

	Q.	Does that suggest to you that given that temporal link, that there is a
causal nexus between the compression of the neck and
the ultimate death?
<P>

	A.	That is what it implies, yes.
<P>

	Q.	Does that suggest to you that the compression of the neck was an operating
and substantial cause in the ultimate death?
<P>

	A.	That's why I have given the combined effects of neck compression with the
others.
<P>

	Q.	But, apart from the conclusions you drew in relation to the autopsy
examination alone, if you factor in that account from the
accused that there
was pushing off, crack, eyes rolling, tongue blue, and then no signs of life,
that rapid, temporal connection;
 does that suggest that the compression of the
neck was an operating and substantial causal factor in the death?
<P>

	A.	Yes."
<P>

100	The precise mechanism of death may be obscure, given the cardiac history of
the deceased, and his state of intoxication.  However,
approaching the matter
in a common sense way, as I am enjoined to do, I am satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that the actions of
the accused caused the death of Richard James Fyfe.
They were the substantial, and operating cause.  They contributed significantly
to his death.
<P>

<b>The Elements of the Offence</b>
<P>

101	The Crown, therefore, has proved beyond reasonable doubt the elements of
murder, namely:
<P>

&#183;	First, the death of Richard James Fyfe on 26 April 1996.
<P>

&#183;	Second, that the actions of the accused in striking Mr Fyfe with a
hammer, and thereafter strangling him, caused that death.
<P>

&#183;	Third, that these actions were unlawful, in that they were not in self
defence.
<P>

&#183;	Fourth, that the accused at the time he struck Richard James Fyfe, and
strangled him, intended to inflict grievous bodily
harm.
<P>

Two matters were raised relevant to the possible reduction of the charge to
manslaughter, namely:
<P>

&#183;	First, there is an issue of provocation.  The onus is, of course, upon
the Crown to exclude beyond reasonable doubt that
there was provocation <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
23(4)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>).
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, the issue of diminished responsibility.  The onus is upon the
accused to establish diminished responsibility upon
the balance of
probabilities.
<P>

102	I will now deal with each of those issues.
<P>

<b>The Issue of Provocation</b>
<P>

103	First, it is plain that the accused, in fact, lost self control.  Secondly,
it is also clear that it was the conduct of the
deceased, in repeatedly calling
Mr Moffatt a dog, which induced that loss of control.  The real issue,
therefore, concerns the third
element of provocation:  was the conduct of the
deceased such that it could have induced an ordinary person, in the position of
the
accused, to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intention,
relevantly, to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased?
<P>

104	In dealing with that issue one must first take account of the position of
the accused <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 23(2)(b)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>).  In <b><i>Stingel v The Queen</i></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 312</a>, the Court said this:  (at 326)
<P>

	"The content and extent of the provocative conduct must be assessed from the
viewpoint of the particular accused.  Were it otherwise,
it would be quite
impossible to identify the gravity of the particular provocation."
<P>

105	Having placed itself in the shoes of the accused, so that the full force
and sting of the insult is understood, an objective
test is then applied.  In
the same case the Court explained that test in the context of the Tasmanian
Criminal Code.  The ordinary
person test is:  (at 327)
<P>

	"... to provide an objective and uniform standard of the minimum powers of
self-control which must be observed before one enters
the area in which
provocation can reduce what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.  While
personal characteristics or attributes
of the particular accused may be taken
into account for the purpose of understanding the implications and assessing
the gravity of
the wrongful act or insult, the ultimate question posed by the
threshold objective test of s 160 (2) relates to the possible effect
of the
wrongful act or insult, <i>so understood and assessed</i>, upon the power of
self-control of a truly hypothetical `ordinary person'.  Subject to a
qualification in relation to age ..., the
extent of the power of self-control
of that hypothetical ordinary person is unaffected by the personal
characteristics or attributes
of the particular accused."  (emphasis in
original)
<P>

106	In <b><i>Green v The Queen</i></b> (1996-97) 191 CLR 334, Brennan CJ
identified the issue arising under s 23(2) of the Crimes Act (NSW) in these
words:  (at 340)
<P>

	"Paragraph (b) requires the jury to take full account of the sting of the
provocation actually experienced by the accused, but
eliminates from the jury's
consideration any extra-ordinary response by the accused to the provocation
actually experienced.  Thus
extra-ordinary aggressiveness or extra-ordinary
want of self-control on the part of an accused confer no protection against
conviction
for murder.
<P>

	The objective test prescribed by par (b) turns not on what the ordinary person
<i>would have done</i> in response to the provocation experienced, but on what
the ordinary person <i>could have been induced to intend</i>."  (emphasis in
original)
<P>

107	Here, there is no question that the accused found the repeated insults of
the deceased (in calling him "a dog", and then "a
mutt") grossly offensive.  He
explained why to Dr Strum:  (Ex 2, p 9)
<P>

	"I asked Mr Moffatt why it mattered that he had been called `a dog'.  He told
me that he was `old school crim' which meant that
he had a criminal record and
had been in gaol and found it offensive to be called `a dog'."
<P>

108	That being the context, the objective standard is then applied.  The
ordinary person, for these purposes, is a person of the
same age as the accused
with ordinary powers of self control, not effected by alcohol.  The written
submissions made on behalf of
the accused acknowledged that the reaction of the
accused was abnormal.  It was not a reaction which an ordinary person, in the
position
of the accused, could, by reason of such insults, have been induced to
intend.  The submission said this, referring to the ERISP
transcript:
<P>

	"About three quarters of an hour later (Q130) the deceased repeated an insult
(Q85) and the accused, while seated on a chair (Q121)
hit the deceased three
times with a hammer (Q85) then started strangling the deceased, who was seated
on the end of a bed (Q124)
and did so for a minute until `I went crack' and he
was dead.
<P>

	The account does not correspond with `normal' reactions to insults.  The
average man does not take to a friend's glassware with
a hammer because a
stranger asks about a piece of property no longer possessed.  The average man
does not commit murder because of
being called a `dog'."
<P>

109	The Crown, therefore, has excluded beyond reasonable doubt the defence of
provocation.
<P>

<b>Diminished Responsibility</b>
<P>

110	In order to establish the defence of diminished responsibility, the accused
must show, on the balance of probabilities, the
following:
<P>

&#183;	First, that he suffered from an abnormality of mind.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, that the abnormality is permanent (rather than transient), and
arises as a consequence of arrested or retarded
development, induced by disease
or injury, or through inherent causes.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, that the abnormality substantially impaired the mental
responsibility of the accused in respect of what he did.
<P>

111	Dr Wong, called by the Crown, did not believe that Mr Moffatt was suffering
from an abnormality of mind (Ex J).
<P>

112	Dr Strum, however, came to a different view.  He reviewed the evidence
concerning the possibility of Organic Brain Syndrome.
 Given Mr Moffatt's
history of alcoholism, he thought it likely that there may be such damage.
There were symptoms consistent with
that diagnosis.  However, his view in
September 1998, when he examined Mr Moffatt, was expressed, finally, in these
terms:  (Ex 2,
p 15)
<P>

	"At the time of interview I noticed that, mentally, Mr Moffatt seemed to be
functioning very well.  There was no disorientation.
 He was able to abstract
adequately.  His general knowledge was good and there was no evidence of an
Organic Brain Syndrome."
<P>

113	Dr Strum, nonetheless, thought that Mr Moffatt's symptoms suggested a
personality disorder, whether Borderline Personality Disorder
or Anti-Social
Personality Disorder.  Further investigation was required, including CT scans,
to clarify whether there was, in fact,
organic brain damage.
<P>

114	A neuro-psychologist, Ms Alexandra Walker, saw the accused in March 1999.
She carried out a number of tests.  The tests, however,
were inconclusive.  She
said this:  (Ex 3, p 4)
<P>

	"The cognitive difficulties described above are relatively subtle, with frank
impairment evident on one test only.  The question
thus arises as to whether
these findings result from acquired damage to the brain or were present
pre-morbidly.  The finding of isolated
impairment on a test may occur in the
apparent absence of brain pathology and therefore is not always considered
abnormal.  In this
case, however, there is no doubt that a significant amount
of alcohol was consumed over a long period, and this is likely to have
resulted
in some damage to the brain.  In addition, the pattern of cognitive impairment
is consistent with that described in the
literature of alcohol-related brain
damage."
<P>

115	Dr Strum was provided with that report (and a further report by Ms
Robilliard, a psychologist).  He then gave the following
evidence:  (T 232)
<P>

	"Q.	Given the psychological assessment contained in those two reports, is it
still your view that at the relevant time Mr Moffatt
suffered from an
abnormality of mind?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I think it is a possibility.  I put the emphasis on mild.  The
abnormality of mind would have been in terms of frontal
lobe damage leading to
personality disorder.  I mean, the abnormality is not one leading to cognitive
disorder, although there may
have been some present.  It was one leading to a
personality disorder with poor judgment and poor impulse control.  I put it no
more
than a possibility."
<P>

116	I accept that the accused did suffer from an abnormality of mind.  I
believe the personality disorders described by Dr Strum
can be so
characterised.  I further believe that in 1996 they were well entrenched.  The
real issue, therefore, concerns whether
the third element of diminished
responsibility has been established, namely, whether the abnormality of mind
substantially impaired
the mental responsibility of the accused for what he
did.
<P>

117	In respect of that issue Dr Strum said this:  (T 234)
<P>

	"HIS HONOUR:  Q.  Significantly or substantially impaired?
<P>

	A.	I do know that.  I have been told in court that there has been some
conflict on that.
<P>

	Look, I think it is going to have to be up to the Court to make its mind up on
this one.  I think it is on the borderline of that.
 I think it was impaired
but I'm not sure to what extent it was impaired.  Five percent, 10 percent, 15
percent.  Certainly not 50
percent.  So, yes, there was impairment, but I wish
I could be more helpful on the third limb.  I can't be."
<P>

118	He added:  (T 234/235)
<P>

	"CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Q.  You certainly would not describe the impairment as
significant?
<P>

	A.	Well, it is significant insofar as his whole life has been a mess and he
has behaved like this before and now finds himself
before the Courts.  Any
impairment that can do this to a person must be significant.  But I still am
not sure whether it was just
that abnormality of mind or other things that
operated to cause him to act as he did.  I think that there was impairment but
I think
it was - it was certainly there.  How substantial it was I am really
not sure.  I think those other factors have to be taken into
account but I do
not think it is for me to do."
<P>

119	His final position, in respect of whether the abnormality substantially
impaired the mental responsibility of the accused was
as follows:  (T 235)
<P>

	"Q.	That is what we are talking about?
<P>

	A.	Yes, it is.  Well, I will say yes, but not with the fullest of
confidence."
<P>

120	I am, however, not persuaded that the abnormality of mind, rather than
other matters, including alcohol, substantially impaired
the mental
responsibility of the accused.  The accused knew what he was doing.  He knew
that he was inflicting serious harm.  He
was acutely aware of his
responsibility once Mr Fyfe became lifeless.  Indeed, he readily acknowledged
that responsibility to everyone
with whom he spoke that morning.
<P>
