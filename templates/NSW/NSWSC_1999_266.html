<b><u>30065/98  -  ELJON PTY LIMITED  v  THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STATE
REVENUE</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an appeal against an assessment of stamp duty
brought pursuant to s 124A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a></b> 1920 as amended
(hereinafter referred to as the Act). 
<P>

2	By its Notice of Objection the plaintiff claims that the defendant
Commissioner erred:
<P>

(a)	in failing to understand that no property was settled by a putative "Trust
Deed" of 27 October 1997; and
<P>

(b)	in finding that the properties were acquired under the terms of a putative
Trust.
<P>

3	A preliminary point was taken by the defendant Commissioner that the
principal ground of appeal urged on behalf of the plaintiff
was not available
to it because its subject matter was not raised by the plaintiff in its Notice
of Objection.
<P>

4	In this regard the defendant argued that the issue raised in the ground of
appeal was not the subject of any ground of the Notice
of Objection.
Accordingly it was put the appeal to this Court being limited by s 124A to the
grounds of the original objection the
matter was not capable of being raised in
these proceedings. I shall return to this point later in these reasons.
<P>

5	The matter arises out of a joint venture in which three parties proposed to
purchase three adjoining properties in Edward Street,
Baulkham Hills, demolish
them and build nine town houses for sale. The parties concerned were a Mr John
McCabe (who is a director
of the plaintiff company), a Mr Tony Macri and a
company called Blairgrove Pty Limited. 
<P>

6	As part of the process of managing the joint venture the three parties and
the plaintiff company entered into an agreement which
was entitled "Deed of
Trust". The document so entitled bears the date 27 October 1997. It nominates
the plaintiff company as the
trustee and Messrs McCabe, Macri and Blairgrove
Pty Limited as the first, second and third beneficiaries respectively.
<P>

7	The Deed is in the following terms:
<P>

	"DEED OF TRUST
<P>

<center>	THIS DEED made the 27th day of October 1997</center>
<P>

	BETWEEN:
<P>

	ELJON PTY LIMITED CAN 060 690 717 of 5 Lisbon Court, Castle Hill in the State
of New South Wales (hereinafter called `the Trustee')
on the first part
<P>

	AND
<P>

	JOHN MCCABE of 5 Lisbon Court, Castle Hill in the said State (hereinafter
called `the First Beneficiary') of the second part
<P>

	AND
<P>

	TONY MACRI of 2 Stephen Street, Hornsby in the said State (hereinafter called
`the Second Beneficiary') of the third part
<P>

	AND
<P>

	BLAIRGROVE PTY LIMITED CAN 073 374 437 of 128 Great North Road, Five Dock in
the said State (hereinafter called `the Third Beneficiary')
of the fourth
part
<P>

	WHEREAS
<P>

	A.	The Trustee has purchased the whole of the properties contained in Folio
6E/406520, 5/23686 and 4/23686 situate at 32-36 Edward
Street, Baulkham Hills
(hereinafter called `the property'); and
<P>

	B.	The First, Second and Third Beneficiaries have paid all of the purchase
price of the property together with all costs and disbursements
relating to the
purchase thereof; and
<P>

	C.	The beneficial owner of the property at the time of the purchase was the
First, Second and Third Beneficiaries as tenants in
common in equal shares.
<P>

	NOW THIS DEED WITNESSES AS FOLLOWS:-
<P>

	1.	The Trustee hereby declares that it holds the property on Trust for the
First, Second and Third Beneficiaries as tenants in
common in equal shares.
<P>

	2.	The First, Second and Third Beneficiaries jointly and severally indemnify
the Trustee in respect of all suits, claims and demands
in respect of the
Trustee's purchase, ownership and sale of the property excepting only the
Trustee's liability to each of the beneficiaries
as a Trustee.
<P>

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and
affixed their seals on the day and year first hereinbefore
written."
<P>

8	The document then contains the common seals of Eljon Pty Limited and
Blairgrove Holdings Pty Limited which are duly affixed and
the witness
signatures of Messrs McCabe and Macri.
<P>

9	As of 27 October 1997 no purchase of the properties nominated in the document
entitled "Deed of Trust" had been completed. Nor
indeed had the first, second
and third beneficiaries paid any part of the purchase price or any costs and
disbursements relating
to those purchases. It thus follows (and about this
there was no issue) that the first, second and third beneficiaries were not
beneficial
owners as at 27 October 1997.
<P>

10	The fact was that on 27 October 1997 a contract for the purchase of the
premises known as 32 Edward Street were exchanged. The
evidence does not reveal
whether or not that exchange happened before the document entitled "Deed of
Trust" was sealed and signed
by the parties to it. Contracts for the purchase
of 34 and 36 Edward Street were not exchanged until 5 November 1997.
<P>

11	The purchase of 32 Edward Street was completed on 8 January 1998. The
purchase of 36 Edward Street on 6 April 1998 and that of
34 Edward Street on 8
May 1998.
<P>

12	For the purposes of this appeal the defendant Commissioner conceded that all
monies payable by the beneficiaries for the purchase
of the subject properties
were in fact paid by 8 May 1998. The concession was made only for the purposes
of this appeal, it being
made plain that should this in fact not be so the
defendant Commissioner would not be estopped from dealing with the matter
otherwise
should the need arise.
<P>

13	The Commissioner assessed duty on the document entitled "Trust Deed" under
para (2)(a) under the heading "Declaration of Trust"
found in the Second
Schedule to the Act. The duty levied under this paragraph amounted to $26,315.

<P>

14	It was the plaintiff's contention that in fact duty should have been levied
under para (1) under that heading in the Second Schedule
which would have
resulted in the amount of duty payable being $10.00.
<P>

15	Paragraph (2)(a) is in the following terms:
</p>
<TABLE><TR valign="TOP" align="center">
<TD colspan=1 align="center"><p>Nature

<P>

(2)(a)  Any instrument declaring that any property vested or to be vested in

16	
</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE><p>
<P>

In determining that the duty payable was to be calculated pursuant to para
(2)(a) and not para (1) the defendant Commissioner ruled
that para (1) only
applied to declarations of (a resulting) trust over property at the time of
execution of the declaration of trust,
is already vested in the trustee.
<P>

17	In so doing the defendant relied upon what had fallen from the High Court in
<b>Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Pendal Nominees</b> <b>Pty Ltd &amp;
Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%2d89%29%20167%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988-89) 167 CLR 1</a> at 16. There Mason CJ observed that the language
of para (1) was unmistakably different to that used in para (2)(a). He went on
to
say:
<P>

	"In particular, the words "or to be vested" which appear in the latter
paragraph are absent from the former. The history of these
provisions reveals
that these words were specifically added to par (2)(a) but that the legislature
did not see fit to insert them
in par (1). A clear distinction was thus made
and persuasive reasons would be needed to imply the presence in para (1) of
words which
appear to have been consciously excluded."
<P>

18	The exclusion Mason CJ was referring to was the exclusion by the
legislature.
<P>

19	The plaintiff's prime contention was that the defendant Commissioner erred
in concluding the duty payable on the instrument under
the provisions of para
(2)(a) and should in fact have assessed the duty payable under para (1) that is
in the sum of $10 rather than
$26,315.
<P>

20	Its argument was that the document was entitled Deed of Trust and was held
as an escrow upon the completion of the purchase of
properties and thus
inoperative from the date it bore, 27 October 1997 until 8 May 1998 when the
settlement of the conveyance of
the last of the properties involved was
completed.
<P>

21	The argument commenced with a reference to a statement made by Mason J (as
he then was) in <b>DKLR Holding Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp
Duties (NSW)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 431:</a>
<P>

	"... liability of an instrument to stamp duty is to be ascertained by
reference to the circumstances which exist when the instrument
is executed...
."
<P>

22	Reliance was also placed upon what fell from Brennan J (as he then was) to
like effect at p 470 in the same case.
<P>

23	The argument continued that the document was not first executed for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38(1)</a> of the Act in accordance with the definition given to
execution of documents under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> because it was put that it was not executed
within the meaning given by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(1)</a> of the Act. 
<P>

24	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 38(1)</a> is in the following terms:
<P>

	"38.(1)  Every person primarily liable with respect to any instrument or
matter of the nature mentioned in this Act is personally
liable to the Crown
for the payment of the duty so chargeable on such instrument immediately upon
the first execution thereof, and
every such person may be sued for the amount
of such duty as for a debt due to the Crown."
<P>

25	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> is in the following terms:
<P>

	"26.  For the purposes of this Act an instrument is deemed to be first
executed the first time that it is signed and sealed, or
signed (as the case
may be) by any party thereto:
<P>

26	The definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(1)</a> is as follows:
<P>

	" `Executed,' with reference to instruments under seal, means signed and
sealed, and with reference to instruments not under seal
means signed."
<P>

27	One difficulty which emerges in dealing with this particular aspect of the
argument advanced is that the limitation imposed by
the general rule adverted
to by Mason J was excepted by him when construing para (2).
<P>

28	Para (2) as it then appeared in the Second Schedule at the time of the
delivery of the decision in <b>DKLR Holding (No 2)</b> is in the same terms as
the present para (2)(a). What Mason J said was this:
<P>

	"The general rule is that the liability of an instrument to stamp duty is to
be ascertained by reference to the circumstances which
exist when the
instrument is executed, though the court can have regard to subsequent events
in order to discover the true position
as the time of execution (Wm Cory &amp;
Son Ltd, [1965] AC at p 1105, per Lord Reid). In other circumstances the
general rule might
require us to narrow the category of instruments falling
within par (2), confining it to declarations effective on their execution
to
create trusts. But the express references in par (2) of the statutory
description to property `to be vested' and which `shall
be held' make it clear
that the operation of the paragraph cannot be so limited."
<P>

29	I shall return to this aspect later in these reasons. The plaintiff rightly
contended that while all deeds are instruments under
seal, not all instruments
under seal are deeds.
<P>

30	Again, rightly the plaintiff submitted that to be validly executed a deed is
required to be signed, sealed and delivered for
the purposes of the common law.

<P>

31	It was argued that as the document was an escrow it was not delivered under
8 May 1998. The concept of a delivery of a deed at
common law has been dealt
with in a number of authorities. Blackburn J in <b>Xenos v Wickham</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281867%29%20LR%202%20HL%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1867)
LR 2 HL 296</a> at 312 said:
<P>

	"... no particular technical form of words or acts is necessary to render an
instrument the deed of the party sealing it. The mere
affixing of the seal does
not render it a deed; but as soon as there are acts or words sufficient to show
that it is intended by
the party to be executed as his deed presently binding
on him, it is sufficient. The most apt and expressive mode of indicating such
an intention is to hand it over, saying: `I deliver this as my deed;' but any
other words or acts that sufficiently show that it
was intended to be finally
executed will do as well. And it is clear on the authorities, as well as the
reason of the thing, that
the deed is binding on the obligor before it comes
into the custody of the obligee, nay, before he even knows of it; though, of
course,
if he has not previously assented to the making of the deed, the
obligee may refuse it."
<P>

32	Lord Denning M R in <b>Vincent v Premo Enterprises (Voucher Sales) Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20QB%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 QB 609</a> at 619 observed as follows:
<P>

	" `Delivery' in this connection does not mean `handed over' to the other side.
It means delivered in the old legal sense, namely,
an act done so as to evince
an intention to be bound. Even though the deed remains in the possession of the
maker, or of his solicitor,
he is bound by it if he has done some act evincing
an intention to be bound, as by saying: `I deliver this my act and deed.' He
may,
however, make the `delivery' conditional: in which case the deed is called
an `escrow' which becomes binding when the condition is
fulfilled."
<P>

33	As Lord Denning stated in <b>Alan Estates Ltd v W G Stores Ltd &amp;
Anor</b> [1982] Ch 511 at 520, the doctrine of escrow is a relic of mediaeval
times. In essence it means the document is in suspense. See
<b>Watkins v
Nash</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=44%20LJ%20Ch%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">44 LJ Ch 505.</a> That is to say the operation of a deed when in escrow is
suspended until the conditions of the suspense are fulfilled.
<P>

34	In <b>Alan Estates Ltd</b>, Lord Denning put the matter this way at 520:
<P>

	"... what is the effect of an escrow before the conditions are fulfilled? One
thing is clear. Whilst the conditions are in suspense,
the maker of the escrow
cannot recall it. He cannot dispose of the land or mortgage it in derogation of
the grant which he has made.
He is bound to adhere to the grant for a
reasonable time so as to see whether the conditions are to be fulfilled or not.
If the conditions
are not fulfilled at all, or not fulfilled within a
reasonable time, he can renounce it. On his doing so, the transaction fails
altogether.
It has no effect at all. But if the conditions are fulfilled within
a reasonable time, then the conveyance or other disposition is
binding on him
absolutely. It becomes effective to pass the title to the land or other
interest in the land from the grantor to the
grantee. The title is then said to
`relate back' to the time when the document was executed and delivered as an
escrow. But this
only means that no further deed or act is necessary in order
to perfect the title of the grantee. As between grantor and grantee,
it must be
regarded as a valid transaction which was effective to pass the title to the
grantee as at the date of escrow: see Perryman's
Case <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1572/284.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1572] EngR 284</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281599%29%205%20Co%20Rep%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1599) 5 Co Rep 84a."</a>
<P>

35	In the same case Sir Denys Buckley, sitting as a member of the Court of
Appeal at 528, stated:
<P>

	"When the conditions of an escrow are fully satisfied, so that it becomes an
immediately operative deed, that effect relates back
to the date of its
delivery in escrow, but not for all purposes - only for such purposes as are
necessary to give effect to the transaction
(Security Trust Co v Royal Bank of
Canada  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] AC 503</a>, 517 per Lord Cross of Chelsea), which I take to mean all
the terms and provisions of the instrument which remain capable of being
given
effect to implement the bargain between the parties."
<P>

36	Ackner LJ at 524 expressed a dissenting view. The plaintiff argued that
despite what had fallen from the Court of Appeal in <b>Alan Estates Ltd</b> the
better view was that the deed bearing date 27 October 1997 did not become
operative until 8 May 1998 because it only served to
record or confirm an
implied or resulting trust as an expressed trust. It would thus be incorrect to
infer that it had a retroactive
effect to 27 October 1997.
<P>

37	Accordingly it was argued that the Deed of Trust did not satisfy the
criterion of being first executed as of 27 October 1997
in accordance with the
meaning given to "execution" by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38(1)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> and the definition found in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
3(1)</a> of the Act. Thus as of 27 October 1997, so the argument ran, the Deed of
Trust was inoperative for all purposes.
<P>

38	It was sought to distinguish <b>Commissioner of Stamp Duties NSW v Pendal
Nominees</b> <b>Pty Ltd</b> because it was put the Deed in the present case
was, as has already been mentioned, first executed as an escrow.
<P>

39	This argument, in my view, appears to founder for a number of reasons.
<P>

(1)	As I have indicated above the limitation upon which the plaintiff relies as
expressed by Mason J in <b>DKLR Holding (No 2)</b> was expressed by that judge
in relation to the verbiage of the very paragraph of the Second Schedule with
which the court is dealing
here.
<P>

(2)	Not only does the submission that the "Deed became operative on 8 May 1998"
appear to be contradicted by what fell from Lord
Denning and Sir Denys Buckley
in <b>Alan Estates Ltd</b> but also a clear expression of principal by Tadgell
J in <b>Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Comptroller of
Stamps</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20VR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] VR 70</a> at 79. There Tadgell J, having found that the
instrument in question was in fact delivered in escrow went on to observe as
follows:
<P>

	"All these contingencies, however, happened; and they had happened at the time
the instrument was assessed to stamp duty. The burden
of the authorities is
that, when the conditions of an escrow are satisfied, so that it becomes an
immediately operative deed, it
takes effect as between the parties to it as
from its delivery in escrow. "
<P>

He then referred to a number of authorities including <b>Alan Estates
Ltd</b>.
<P>

(3)	Liability for duty under the Act depends solely on whether the instrument
responds to the description in para (2)(a) "as at
the time of first execution".
See <b>Nichols Cabramatta Wholesale Stationery Supplies Pty Ltd v Commissioner
of Stamp Duties NSW</b> (1993) 93 ATC 4647 at 4651.
<P>

(4)	The preamble to the definition section of the Act <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(1)</a> commences "In this
Act, unless the context or subject matter otherwise indicates or requires:"
which plainly refers to "context or
subject matter" meaning not the context or
subject matter of an instrument but of the relevant provisions "in this
Act".
<P>

(5)	There is nothing in para (2)(a) of the Second Schedule which requires that
an instrument needs anything more than being signed
or sealed. Ex facie, a
deed, which is unarguably an instrument for the purposes of the Act is liable
to duty immediately on signing
and sealing without reference to delivery. See
Hill<b> Stamp Duties</b> para 1.80 and the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> of the Act.
<P>

(6)	Even if the document entitled "Deed of Trust" had no legal operation, the
authorities make it clear that para (2)(a) renders
such an instrument liable to
duty under the paragraph. In <b>DKLR Holding (No 2)</b> at 471 Brennan J
said:
<P>

	"Instruments which have no legal operation as well as instruments which are
effective declarations of trust are brought to charge
by par (2) if their terms
answer the statutory description. It is not necessary to enquire as to the
likelihood of the property becoming
vested in the declarant, or as to the
intentions or expectations of the declarant or of the person in whom the
property is presently
vested. It follows that an instrument which declares that
property comprised in the instrument shall be held in trust by the declarant
is
chargeable, for unless the property comprised in the instrument is presently
vested in the declarant, it must be property to be
vested in him. Construing
par (2) in this way, the terms of the instant declaration answer the statutory
description and the instrument
is brought o charge accordingly." See also
<b>Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties NSW</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%2060%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 60 SR (NSW) 539</a> at
545-546.
<P>

40	It follows from these considerations that the document entitled "Trust Deed"
even if an escrow was at least an instrument which
was first executed for the
purposes of the Act by the plaintiff on 27 October 1997.
<P>

41	Furthermore, if for the purposes of para (2)(a) the escrow conditions must
be first fulfilled before the instrument, which is
also a deed, is first
executed for the purposes of the Act then on the authorities of <b>Alan Estates
Ltd</b>  and <b>Ansett Transport Industries (Operations)</b> the document in
question was first executed by the plaintiff on 27 October 1997.
<P>

42	In <b>Tooheys Limited &amp; Ors v Commissioner of Stamp Duties NSW</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20105%20CLR%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 105 CLR 602</a> at 609 and 611 in dealing with the phrase "to be vested" in
the then clause 2 of the Second Schedule (which as I have already mentioned
is
identical with the present para (2)(a)) the High Court held that where contrary
to what a "Trust Deed" stated, a sum of 50,000
was not contributed to a
superannuation fund until after the execution of the deed established the fund,
that sum was held to be
assessable under the "to be vested" phrase in the
paragraph.
<P>

43	While there were dissenting views in the High Court relating to one aspect
of the judgment of the Full Court of NSW on a point
which bears no relevance to
this matter, all judges of the High Court agreed that whilst the judgment of
the NSW Full Court which
was written by Walsh J, correctly construed the then
extant para (2) of the Second Schedule of the Act.
<P>

44	In <b>Toohey's Ltd &amp; Ors v Commissioner of Stamp Duties</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] SR
(NSW) 539</a> at 545, Walsh J said:
<P>

	"For the description of an instrument contained in para (2) under the heading
`declaration of trust' in the schedule is not so
phrased as to be confined to
declarations which create or which evidence a trust which is thereby or has
already been completely
constituted in such a way that property is then
irrevocably subjected to the trust, and that the trusts are thenceforth
immediately
enforceable. Because of the inclusion of the words `vested or to be
vested' and the words `is or shall be held in trust', the description
extends
to cases where no property is as yet vested in the proposed trustee, and it
extends to cases in which no trust presently
operative is declared. Thus it
extends, in my opinion, to instruments which would not be classified, in the
ordinary language of
an equity lawyer, as being declarations of trust. The
question is not, therefore, whether this deed is, in the ordinary sense of
the
term, a declaration of trust, but whether it satisfied the statutory
description. It is only to be expected that this description
would go beyond
the ordinary sense of the term, since `ordinary' declarations of trust as
included in the definition of `conveyance'
and are thus chargeable without
recourse to the provision now under consideration."
<P>

45	Accordingly, the fact that none of the property referred to in the subject
"Trust Deed" was not vested in the plaintiff at the
time of the execution of
the deed, that no operative trust may not have been constituted by the deed,
that the words "to be vested"
do not occur in the deed and that the recital is
incorrect in stating that the plaintiff had purchased all properties does not
exclude
the "Trust Deed" from liability under para (2)(a).
<P>

46	Additionally, the High Court has construed the words "to be vested" as
importing mere futurity. In <b>DKLR Holding (No 2)</b> at 471 Brennan J
said:
<P>

	"The property `to be vested' is the property `comprised therein'. The phrase
`to be vested' imports futurity, in contrast with
`vested'. `Vested' speaks of
property presently vested in the declarant, `to be vested' speaks of property
to be vested in him in
the future. In Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp
Duties (NSW), (1961) 105 CLR at 612 Dixon CJ said of this provision:
<P>

	`the words `any property vested or to be vested' seem to me to be directed
simply to the two cases, namely the case of the declaration
of a trust of
property then vested in the person who declares the trust and the second case
of a declaration of trust in advance
of the vesting in the person who declares
it of property which it is intended to make the subject of the trust.'
<P>

47	Neither the words of para (2)(a) nor the judgment of Dixon CJ in <b>Toohey's
Ltd</b> suggest that anything more than futurity of vesting is imported by the
words `to be vested'. The intention referred to by Dixon CJ
is not an intention
to vest the property in the declarant but to make the property the subject of
the trust when vested. That intention,
expressed by the declarant in the
instrument, is the only intention imported in para (2)(a) and it is imported by
the words `shall
be held in trust' not by the words `to be vested'."
<P>

48	In <b>Pendal Nominees Pty Ltd</b>, Mason J having observed that in <b>DKLR
Holding (No 2)</b> Brennan J (as did Gibbs CJ) considered the words "to be
vested" imported a mere futurity concluded that perhaps contrary to what
he
himself had said in <b>DKLR Holding (No 2)</b> the construction given to para
(2)(a) by Gibbs CJ and Brennan J should now be adopted. He went onto observe at
15:
<P>

	"The liability of an instrument to duty should not call for an inquiry into
the intention of the maker of the instrument. The fact
that the maker takes the
trouble to execute the instrument is enough to bring para (2)(a) into
operation. Actual intention or expectation
is not a criterion of operation of
the sub-paragraph."
<P>

49	It is apparent from the facts that at the time when the "Trust Deed" was
signed and sealed by the plaintiff and the other parties,
none of the three
properties had vested in the plaintiff. If the contract relating to 32 Edward
Street had been in fact exchanged
before the signing and sealing of the "Trust
Deed" the only interest which the plaintiff would have had was an equitable
interest.
See <b>Stern v McArthur</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 489</a> at 522.
<P>

50	In short as of 27 October 1997 all three properties fell squarely within the
phrase "to be vested" in para (2)(a). Accordingly,
in my view the principal
submission made on behalf of the plaintiff must fail.
<P>

51	In relation to this submission, as I have noted above, objection was taken
to it being argued on the basis that it had not been
raised in the Notice of
Objection by the plaintiff to the Commissioner.
<P>

52	In the Notice of Objection the plaintiff's objection which it was claimed
founded the appeal included the following:
<P>

1.	It was put that the expression "void and inoperative" was sufficient to
found the argument which I have set out and dealt with
above. It is true that
in dealing with review matters there is authority for the proposition that in
determining whether the ground
of appeal can be argued by a tax payer the
courts should not interpret grounds of objection made technically, narrowly or
with rigidity.
See Dixon J in <b>A L Campbell &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Federal
Commissioner of Taxation</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2082%20CLR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 82 CLR 452</a> at 461. To like effect, Williams
J in <b>H R Lancey Shipping Co Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner ofTaxation</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%209%20ATD%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 9 ATD 267</a> at 273. 
<P>

53	These authorities were in the context of the then extant s 185 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a></b> 1936 which required an objector to "state
fully and in detail" the grounds upon which he relies. Under this Act the only
requirement
is for an objector to lodge a statement in writing of the grounds
of his objection.
<P>

54	Here there was no suggestion made that the Deed of Trust was in fact void.
Albeit the argument was that at the time it was signed
and sealed, it was
inoperative.
<P>

55	The grounds of the objection taken were as follows:-
<P>

(a)	the Trust Deed is void and inoperative because at the date of the
declaration (27 October 1997) it was not properly constituted,
the contracts of
sale relating to the relevant property (nos 32, 34 and 36 Edward Street,
Baulkham Hills) being contrary to the premises
set out in the Trust Deed;
<P>

(b)	para (2)(a) does not apply because the Trust Deed failed to declare that
any future property was to be vested in the objector;
and
<P>

(c)	the liability should be computed by reference to each individual property
rather than the aggregate amount.
<P>

56	In addition to its argument that the grounds of objection should not be
looked at narrowly, the plaintiff contended that this
point fell within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 100</a>
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/" class="autolink_findacts">Taxation Administration Act</a></b> 1996 NSW. That section, which has
operated since 1 July 1998 provides:
<P>

	"The appellant's and respondent's cases on the appeal are not limited to the
grounds of the objection."
<P>

57	The summons in this matter was filed on 25 June 1998. The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/" class="autolink_findacts">Taxation
Administration Act</a></b>, by Schedule One, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a> does not apply to any Notice of
Decision or Determination of the Commissioner made prior to 1 July 1998.
Accordingly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 100</a> cannot be called in aid by the plaintiff in this matter.
<P>

58	In <b>Szajntop v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2042%20FCR%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 42 FCR 318</a> at
327.9, it was held that the question to be posed is whether the Commissioner
could reasonably be expected to gather from the written
objection that he was
being asked to apply his mind to the contention then being raised.
<P>

59	In my view the escrow point could not be thought to be a matter which the
Commissioner could reasonably have been expected to
gather from either the
written objection or the correspondence.
<P>

60	In my view the matter raised with which I have dealt is so far distant from
any concepts taken in the grounds of objection that
in fact the points taken by
the defendant should in fact be upheld. However, in any event I have dealt with
the matter on its merits.
<P>

61	Finally, the plaintiff submitted in the alternative as follows:
<P>

	"If it is held that the Deed was first `executed' as at 27 October 1997, even
though the first party delivered it as an escrow
then a legal fiction is
necessarily created. In other words, the Deed is read `as if' it was
unconditional. In such a case there
is no requirement to investigate the truth
of the recitals. On its face it answers the description set out in paragraph 1
under the
head of Declaration of Trust. It is `a fundamental principle of the
law relating to stamp duties that duty is levied on instruments
not on the
underlying transactions per Mason J in DKLR Holding (No 2) Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 431</a> at 449. Thus the Deed is
to be assessed nominal duty of $10. There is no warrant to impose duty under
paragraph 2(a). To do so is
to make an unworkable alloy of fact and fiction. It
is simply impermissible to read into the deed that the properties were `to be
vested' so as to fall under paragraph 2(a). To do so would be to contradict the
words of the Deed which recites in the <u>past tense</u> that an implied trust
as at 27 October 1997 was effectively established; see paras, A, B and C. As
such it satisfied paragraph 1."
<P>

62	In particular the construction adopted by Walsh J in the Full Court in
<b>Toohey's Ltd,</b> to which I have made reference, is in my view decisive of
this argument. Here as in <b>Toohey's</b> case, the property (in
<b>Toohey's</b> case money, in this case real property) did not become trust
property until after the execution of the instrument. Accordingly this
submission, like the primary submission, must fail.
<P>

63	It follows there will be a judgment for the defendant plus costs.
