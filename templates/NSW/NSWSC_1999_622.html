<b>2244/98 - JOHN R TURK &amp; SONS (ARTARMON) PTY LTD  v  NEWMONT TELEVISION
PTY LIMITED </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE, REVISED 18 JUNE 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Newmont Television Pty Limited (In Liquidation) was
wound up by order of the Court made on 26 October 1998.  Christopher
Wykes, who
is an official liquidator, was appointed to be liquidator.
<P>

2  	The company was registered in November 1993 and operated a
business for the production of television programs from that time.
 As
liquidator Mr Wykes has conducted investigations into the affairs of the
company including communications with clients and suppliers,
interview of
directors, examination of the books of the company, discussion with the
company's bankers and creditors and the conduct
of an examination of certain
persons, including the directors under ss 596A and 596B of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

3  	He has identified the major assets of the company at the time of
winding up to be -
<P>

(a)	         a potential preference action against a creditor for approximately
$80,000;
<P>

(b)	a potential claim with respect to the transfer of the program called
`Bright Ideas' from the company to a related entity; and
<P>

(c)	         a potential insolvent trading action against the directors of the
company.
<P>

4  	The total amount of the proofs of debt is approximately
$1,426,436.  In Mr Wykes' view, unless the legal proceedings referred
to as
assets of the company are successful and result in additional funds being
received, there will be no dividend to the creditors
in the liquidation.
<P>

5  	The potential preference claim is disputed by the creditor.  Mr
Wykes' evidence is that a successful result in the insolvent
trading claim and
the action in relation to the transfer of `Bright Ideas' would depend on there
being sufficient assets of the defendants
to those proceedings to make the
legal proceedings viable in the interests of creditors. Mr Wykes has presented
evidence to the effect
that one of the directors who would be a defendant,
Robert Delamont, and his company Delco Productions are without assets and he
says he believes that the third potential defendant, Barry Newman, has
insufficient assets to warrant commencement of proceedings
against him. 
<P>

6  	Mr Wykes has received a proposal for a deed of company
arrangement to be entered into pursuant to arrangements involving Mr
Delamont
and his company Delco Productions which could, if successfully implemented,
result in the company receiving some payment
over a period of three or four
years.  The payment would enable the company to make a distribution to
creditors which is hoped to
be in the vicinity of eighteen cents in the
dollar.
<P>

7  	In light of his legal advice and information available to him as
to the financial circumstances of the potential defendants,
Mr Wykes has formed
the commercial judgment that the proposed deed of company arrangement may be in
the interests of the creditors
of the company subject to certain conditions.
He therefore proposes, in order to give creditors the opportunity to consider
the deed
of company arrangement, that he be appointed under s 436B(2) as the
administrator of the company, and he seeks the leave of the Court
to permit
that appointment to occur.
<P>

8  	On 4 June 1999 a meeting of the committee of creditors in the
liquidation of the company resolved that Mr Wykes be instructed
to approach the
Court for leave to appoint himself administrator under s 436B(2).  The largest
non-related creditor of the company,
the Australian Taxation Office which is
owed approximately $335,518, according to the evidence of Mr Wykes has no
objection to his
appointment as administrator and indeed its representative on
the committee of inspection voted in favour of the motion to instruct
him to
approach the Court.  Only one member of the committee of inspection, the
representative of Bizreport Pty Limited, opposed
the motion but that creditor
has consented to representation on the committee of creditors should the
proposed administration proceed.
<P>

9  	The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has been
informed by Mr Wykes of his intention to appoint himself administrator.
 ASIC
was invited to attend the meeting of the committee of inspection held on 4 June
199.  The evidence of Mr Wykes is that the
representative of ASIC with whom he
had been dealing told him that `ASIC will attend the meeting if we believe it
warranted', but
ASIC did not attend.
<P>

10  	Mr Wykes says that he is unaware of any inappropriate advantage
which would be gained by his appointment as administrator.
 He draws attention
to the understanding of the actions and history of the company and its
directors and the company's affairs which
he has gained in his position as
liquidator and says, if he is appointed administrator, the company will have
the advantage of saving
costs which might otherwise be incurred by an
administrator becoming familiar with the company's affairs and conducting
investigations.
<P>

11  	Finally, he says that before his appointment as liquidator by
the Court he was unaware of the existence of and had no dealings
with the
company, its directors or related entities; and since his appointment he has
formed no personal relationship with the directors
and believes he would be
able to perform the duties of an administrator independently and in the
interests of creditors.
<P>

12  	In these circumstances, I am persuaded that it is appropriate to
make an order granting leave under s 436B(2) forthwith.  The
effect of my
making the order is not to terminate or extinguish the liquidation.  It will be
necessary at a later stage for an application
to be made to that effect, after
the creditors have had the opportunity to consider a report from Mr Wykes as
administrator and the
proposed deed of company arrangement.  The fact that a
further application will be needed is relevant to the question whether the
Court should insist that ASIC be given specific notice of the application.  In
my view it is sufficient that in the present circumstances
ASIC was informed
that a meeting of the committee of inspection would be held to consider the
proposal to appoint Mr Wykes as administrator
and was invited to attend that
meeting and that at this stage the effect of my orders is merely to give the
creditors the opportunity
to consider the proposed deed of company arrangement
in circumstances where a further application will need to be made to terminate
the liquidation.  While I believe that in the circumstances adequate notice has
been given to ASIC of the present application, I
propose to make a direction to
the effect that ASIC be notified of today's order.
<P>

13  	Generally the approach to be taken by the Court to an
application for leave under s 436B(2) is explained in the judgment of
Hodgson J
in <i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Food Corp Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20796" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13
ACSR 796.</a>  There his Honour said the main question is whether the liquidator is
an appropriate person to be an administrator.  
<P>

14  	Given that Mr Wykes has had no association with the company and
its directors before being appointed liquidator by this Court
and that on his
evidence he has not built up any personal relationship with directors after the
appointment and that he has accumulated
understanding of and information about
the company in the performance of his duties as liquidator, I am persuaded that
he is an appropriate
person for that appointment.
<P>

15  	Mr Wykes seeks ancillary orders along the lines of the orders
made by Bryson J in <i>The Cobar Mines Pty Limited (Receiver and Manager
Appointed) (In Liquidation)</i> (No 2661 of 1998, unreported, 18 December
1998).  Subject to one modification, I am persuaded that the ancillary orders
sought by
Mr Wykes should be made.
<P>

16  	The first ancillary order is to dispense with the meeting of
creditors which would otherwise be required under s 436E within
five business
days of the appointment of the administrator.  There are two reasons for making
this order.  The first is that the
company has been the subject of a procedure,
namely its liquidation, in which creditors have been given the opportunity to
express
their views and have appointed a committee of inspection which approves
the present course of action.  The second is that the orders
which I shall make
ensure that a meeting of creditors will be convened within a short period to
consider the proposal for a deed
of company arrangement and at that meeting
creditors will have the option of deciding to continue with the liquidation.
<P>

17  	The second ancillary order is that the present committee of
inspection be the committee of creditors in the administration.
 The
appointment of a committee of creditors is a matter which would normally be
attended to at the meeting of creditors convened
under s 436E.  It seems to me
that no useful purpose would be served in having that matter considered in the
circumstances described
above and that it is, therefore, appropriate that the
existing committee should be given continuity in this way.
<P>

18  	The third ancillary order is an order authorising Mr Wykes as
administrator to convene what would normally be a second meeting
of creditors
in an administration, that is, the meeting under s 439A at a date earlier than
the time contemplated by s 439A(2). 
In my opinion, it is strongly in the
interests of creditors that the proposed deed of company arrangement be
presented to them expeditiously
and in my view it would be inappropriate to
require them to wait until the expiration of the time specified in s 439A(2)
and (5).

<P>

19  	I therefore propose to authorise the administrator to convene
the meeting earlier but my intention is to go further.  It seems
to me in this
case appropriate to direct the administrator that the meeting be convened on or
before a specified early date.   Mr
Wykes has no objection to that course of
action and accordingly my order will direct that the meeting be convened to be
held on or
before Friday 18 June 1999.  
<P>

20  	I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Notice of
Motion.  I make an order in terms of paragraph 4 adding the
words `and I direct
that the meeting be convened to be held on or before Friday 18 June 1999'.
<P>

21  	I note the undertaking of the applicant's solicitor to notify
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission of the contents
of these
orders.
