<div>IN THE SUPREME COURT <br><br>OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br><br>EQUITY
DIVISION<br><br><br><br><br><br>MASTER MACREADY<br><br><br><br>Friday 21 May
1999<br><br><br><br><b>3131/98 JASMINE ROSARIA D&#8217;ALBORA v ANTHONY
D&#8217;ALBORA</b><br><br><br><br><b>JUDGMENT</b><br><br><br>1 <b>MASTER
MACREADY:</b> This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in respect
of the estate of the late Ethel Doreen Quinn who died on 22 February 1997. She
was survived by her daughter Sharon Quinn,
two grandchildren, the plaintiff,
Jasmine D&#8217;Albora and the defendant, Anthony D&#8217;Albora. The
grandchildren are the children
of the daughter, Sharon Quinn. Sharon has been
given notice of the proceedings and she makes no claim.<br><br>2 By her will
made 8 February 1996 the deceased left the whole of her estate to the defendant
and appointed him Executor. <br><br>3 The assets of the deceased at the date of
death consisted of her property 57 Boondilla Road, The Entrance and cash of
$10,131.60.
The house has been sold and the estate reduced to cash.
Administration, funeral and other testamentary expenses have been paid and
the
balance, namely, $158,051.46 has been distributed to the defendant. He has
subsequently purchased a house using that money and
some borrowed
funds.<br><br>4 There are costs which have been incurred by the parties in the
proceedings. The defendant&#8217;s costs on the basis of the hearing
would be
for two days was $12,092. In the event the matter has only proceeded for one
hearing day. The plaintiff&#8217;s costs on
a two day basis were estimated at
$15,400. <br><br>5 As there are difficulties in this case in determining whether
the plaintiff was at any particular time wholly or partly dependent
upon her
grandmother, the deceased it is necessary to ensure that the chronology of the
family history is understood. I turn to that
question. The plaintiff who was
born on 10 February 1971 is now 28. The defendant was born on 20 June 1973 and
is now 25. In the
mid to late 1970s the plaintiff&#8217;s parents lived at
Kingsford and then Mallabar. At that time the plaintiff&#8217;s maternal
grandparents were living at Maroubra. <br><br>6 In 1977 the grandparents moved
to the Entrance. They first lived in a caravan and then the property which they
purchased at 57 Boondilla
Road, The Entrance. <br><br>7 In 1981 the
parties&#8217; parents separated. They divorced some time in 1982 or 1983 and
the two children, the parties to the proceedings,
spent one year in St
Anthony&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Home at Croydon. At the end of that period of
one year the parties&#8217; father
was granted custody of the children. They
moved back to live with him and his new wife Lisa D&#8217;Albora. She had
already 4 children
of her own before meeting the parties&#8217; father. They
subsequently had another child.<br><br>8 In 1987 the plaintiff left high school
having completed Year 11 and she went to TAFE for a year to do a course.
<br><br>9 In 1988 the defendant moved to the Entrance to live with his maternal
grandparents on a full time basis while he completed high
school. He completed
high school in 1992 and then moved to Sydney.<br><br>10 In 1993 the father of
the parties moved out of the Housing Commission home at Merrylands which he had
been occupying and between
them the lease was transferred to the plaintiff who
remained in occupation in that Housing Commission home. <br><br>11 On 10 April
1996 the parties&#8217; maternal grandfather died. He had been suffering from
Alzheimers disease. In July 1996 the
plaintiff was evicted from the Housing
Commission house as she could not meet the rent. Her life then had a period of
disarray. <br><br>12 On 22 February 1997 the deceased died and probate of the
will was granted on 19 June 1997. <br><br>13 On 30 June 1997 a notice of
intended distribution was published. On 28 July 1997 contracts for the sale of
the house were exchanged.<br><br>14 On 28 November 1997 the defendant purchased
a property at 18 Ferndale Close, Wentworthville, for $233,000. He borrowed
$110,000
to do so and presently would owe approximately $107,000 on that
mortgage. <br><br>15 On 14 July 1998 the summons in this matter was issued.
There seems to have been no correspondence prior to this date warning of
the
commencement of these proceedings. <br><br>16 As I have already indicated the
plaintiff in order to establish that she is an eligible person must show that
she was at any particular
time wholly or partly dependent upon the deceased. The
plaintiff&#8217;s case on this aspect is based upon allegations that she resided
during holiday periods with her maternal grandparents and was dependent upon
them for accommodation, food, clothing and other necessities
of life. The
particular periods over which the plaintiff alleges that this occurred are not
easy to ascertain but there appear to
be four different periods.<br><br>17 The
first is a period of 12 months shortly after deceased and her husband commenced
to reside in a caravan at the Entrance in 1977.
At this stage the plaintiff
would have been approximately six and the defendant approximately four. Not
surprisingly neither the
plaintiff nor the defendant gave evidence of these
occasions. However evidence was given by the parties&#8217; mother. Her evidence
was that during this period 12 months following the grandparents moving to the
Entrance the two children resided during each of the
school holidays in May and
August and Christmas. The reason given was that the parties&#8217; mother was
working at Parramatta and
was unable to care for the children. Apparently the
father also had difficulties in this regard. The father of the parties, Antonio
D&#8217;Albora gave evidence in this case. While he responded to some of the
plaintiff&#8217;s and other witnesses&#8217; affidavits
he gave no evidence to
dispute this particular period when the children resided with the grandparents.
The arrangements for support
of the children when they were with the
grandparents in these holiday periods was dealt with by the parties&#8217;
mother who gave
evidence that she did not provide any financial assistance at
that time. She also gave evidence that the deceased bought additional
clothing
for the children at a local second hand clothing store at the Entrance during
the times that the children were in their
care. As I have mentioned no evidence
was given by the father of the children as to this period and, accordingly,
there is no reason
why I should not accept the evidence of the parties&#8217;
mother on the fact that the plaintiff did reside with her grandparents
for each
of the three holiday periods during that year and that no monies were provided
by the mother or father to assist with their
support during this period. There
is no evidence as to the ownership of the house of the grandparents at The
Entrance but this is
not critical. To the extent that there was accommodation
provided even if the home was in the name of the grandfather rather than
the
deceased grandmother one would think at a practical level that the provision of
accommodation required the consent of both the
relevant parties and thus in that
sense the deceased may have, even though not the owner of the house, been party
to the provision
of the accommodation.<br><br>18 The next period which is
alleged is the period of one year during which the children were both in St
Anthony&#8217;s Children&#8217;s
home at Concord. This was in 1983 when the
plaintiff was 12 and the defendant was 10. <br><br>19 According to the plaintiff
the children were allowed out at weekends but did not go to either of their
parents. Apparently they
spent the weekend time at their father&#8217;s
parents&#8217; home or with other relatives. The plaintiff says that during that
year
while they were at St. Anthony&#8217;s they spent all of the school
holidays with the deceased and her husband at The Entrance. The
defendant refers
to this period in his evidence and concedes that some of the school holidays
were spent at the deceased&#8217;s
house at The Entrance.<br><br>20 The father
of the parties gave evidence in which he responded in a general way to the
allegations in respect of this period and
also the period which I will consider
next which is from 1983 to 1987. The effect of his evidence was that the
plaintiff did not
spend all of her school holidays at The entrance and would
visit once or twice a year some times only for short periods. He suggested
that
the visits would last from two days up to a week. The father suggested that in
this period and the next period he would give
some money to the deceased to help
support the children when they visited. No details were given and particularly
it is not suggested
that he turned his mind to the cost of providing
accommodation. In respect of another later period when the defendant was living
there full time the father conceded that although he did send monies those would
not have been sufficient to support Anthony. <br><br>21 If one stand back and
looks at the situation of the parties of particular note was that this is the
year in which the parents were
arguing over the divorce and were not looking
after the children. I think it is highly likely that at least some of the
holidays
in this year while they were in the home were spent at the
grandparents. Even though there might have been some provision of help
by the
father I would doubt that it would have covered in effect the cost of providing
a roof over the children&#8217;s head during
these holidays that they spent with
the grandparents. <br><br>22 The next period covers the period after 1983 and up
until 1987. By the end of 1983 both of the children had moved back to live
with
their father and his second wife together with all her children. The plaintiff
says that she would spend weekends and school
holidays with the grandparents at
The Entrance and that this continued until 1987. She put an estimate on the time
she would spend
each year with her grandparents of three months. Cross
examination suggested that this would be a combination of both weekend time
and
holidays. To my mind it is something of an exaggeration. The defendant&#8217;s
answer to this evidence is that he and his sister
would visit the grandfather on
special occasions and during school holidays. He said that they did not spend
all of the holidays
but usually spent a few weeks with them. By 1987 the
plaintiff was 16 and the defendant 14. I have already mentioned the
father&#8217;s
evidence on this aspect and suggestions that he sent money. The
defendant also indicated that they were given pocket money for minor
matters
when they did go to visit the grandparents.<br><br>23 Some evidence was also
given by Gwen Simmonds a friend of the deceased. She was a member of the same
bowling club and had met the
deceased in about 1980. She recalls in that 1988
the plaintiff and the defendant would visit on weekends and she also recalled
the
defendant living there while he completed his high school education. After
this was completed in 1992 she noticed the plaintiff coming
up more frequently.
She also recalls a statement by the deceased to the effect that the children
first came when they were very small
and that she used to have the children for
school holidays and Christmas.<br><br>24 Considering all the evidence I do not
accept the plaintiff&#8217;s assertions that she spent all her holidays at this
time at The
Entrance. It seems more likely that she spent a large number of
holidays at The Entrance residing with the grandparents and that
there was some
provision by the father towards her expenses the amount of which is not
clear.<br><br>25 The next period which is alleged by the plaintiff is a period
from 1990 to 1991. The plaintiff alleges that from the beginning
of 1990 until
November 1991 she was on unemployment benefits living with her father at
Merrylands and in the Housing Commission house.
She said that during the period
she continued to stay with her grandparents at holiday times. There is no
suggestion in this evidence
that she spent the whole of her holidays and it is
in quite vague terms. The defendant&#8217;s response was that at that time he
was completing Year 11. He says that the plaintiff did not spend any holidays
with the grandparents but she did make a couple of
visits during the period
which consisted of day trips or staying overnight. Given the lack of precision
in the plaintiff&#8217;s
evidence I am not prepared to accept that there were
any substantial periods of residence during this period.<br><br>26 The Court of
Appeal has considered the question of dependency in a number of cases. Initially
for example in <b>Ball v Newey </b>(1988) 13 NSWLR at 1989 the Court did not
decide whether dependence could be other than financial. <br><br>27 In
<b>Petrohilos v Hunter</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 343</a> at 346 the Court once again
considered the meaning of dependency. At page 346 the Court had the following to
say:-<br><br>"I would respectfully disagree with the master in both respects.
The word "dependent" is an ordinary English word, and whether a person
is or has
been wholly or partly dependent upon another is a question of fact. No doubt one
of the commonest forms of dependence is
a financial one, in the sense that the
dependence flows from the fact that accommodation, food, clothing and other
necessities or
amenities of life are provided by the person who owns or is
otherwise entitled to the accommodation and pays for the other things.
But I do
not think that the word, as used in the statute or otherwise, has this very
limited meaning. In ordinary parlance, young
children are properly and commonly
said to be dependent on their mother as well as their father, regardless of
where the money comes
from. A contrary view, that young children are not
dependent on their mother if she has no independent means, seems to me to be a
misuse of the language. This accords with what Samuels JA said in<b> Ball v
Newey </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 489</a> at 491, that "'Dependent" in the ordinary sense of
the word, means the condition of depending on something or on someone for what
is needed." If the correct view were that the context of the statute requires a
limitation of the word to 'financial or material'
matters as McLelland J said in
<b>Re Fulop Deceased</b> or to 'other forms of dependence analogous to but
distinct from financial dependence' as Samuels JA suggested in <b>Ball v
Newey</b> (at 491), then surely a mother's services to a young child satisfy the
test. The child could not survive without the provision of
those services; he or
she needs them. To suggest that, in a money sense, they are valueless, is simply
wrong. If the provision of
accommodation by a father for a young child, that is,
having the child live in a house which he owns and lives in, can make the child
partly dependent upon the father, as it undoubtedly can, I am unable to see why
the provision by a mother to her children, living
with her, of the services
essential for their well-being does not make them partly dependent upon her. In
my opinion it does. The
same considerations apply to a step-child or his or her
step-mother, when the child lives with the step-mother and is looked after
by
her. I appreciate that a different view has been taken by others, as for
example, by Powell J in <b>Dunn v Public Trustee </b>(Powell J, 1 June 1989,
unreported), but I would respectfully disagree with that view. In my opinion the
plaintiff was partly dependent
upon the deceased, certainly for many years of
her childhood and probably until her marriage, although no doubt her dependence
diminished
in the latter years of this period."<br><br>28 In <b>McKenzie v.
Baddeley</b> (Court of Appeal unreported 3 December 1991) his Honour Mr. Justice
Meagher, although in the minority, further discussed dependency
and described it
as "financial economic or material dependency not a mere emotional dependency".
Importantly in that case the majority
held that the word "partly" in the phrase
"partly dependent" does not mean "substantially". <br><br>29 In <b>Williams v
Legge </b>(Court of Appeal 16 March 1993) the Court in considering a case of a
young child needing mothering pointed out that the absence of
financial
dependence is not conclusive.<br><br>30 The defendants have referred me to the
decision of mine <b>Smith v Public Trustee</b> on 28 July 1994 when I had to
consider questions of dependency as well as whether the person was part of the
household. On that occasion
I commented on the plaintiff&#8217;s evidence that
it amounted to no more than that the plaintiff was at the most looked after on
a
few occasions when his mother went into hospital at some time between his birth
and when he was 5 years of age. I could draw no
conclusion about how long or
frequently this occurred. I added the comment, &#8220;The evidence so far as
school holidays are concerned
I think they are not of significance. Holidays are
simply that and I would not think that that would assist.&#8221; I concluded
that
even though the plaintiff was wholly dependent during the periods he was at
the household the minimal extent of those visits meant
that they were not such
that they can be described as significant. That case was one where the question
really was whether the part
dependency was such as could be described as
significant.<br><br>31 In the present case there are a number of periods which
have to be considered. The first is the period in 1977 for a year when
the
plaintiff was six. As I have found there were three school holidays when the
plaintiff was looked after by her grandparents.
The period, particularly bearing
in mind that there was also a Christmas holiday period were not insignificant
and given the age
of the plaintiff at this time there could be no doubt that the
plaintiff was totally dependent upon the grandparents for that period.
In 1983 I
have concluded that there were several periods of holidays when the plaintiff
resided with the grandparents. She was at
that stage 12 and given her age, even
if there was some provision of funds to meet her costs by her father, there
would have been
dependency to the extent of the care that would be required to
look after a 12 year old girl and provide her with an appropriate
home
environment. <br><br>32 The next period is from 1983 to 1987. By the end of this
period the plaintiff was 16. She had been spending several of her holidays
each
year with the grandparents residing there probably for up to two weeks at a time
although probably at some stage a bit less.
Obviously as her age increases the
dependency becomes less but even by provision of accommodation and a family
environment one would
have thought that there was partial dependency during this
period. <br><br>33 It is necessary to look at whether in fact a combination of
these periods could be described as significant. The first of these
was brought
about because the mother simply was not available to look after the children and
neither, apparently, was the father.
The second was because the parents of the
children were waring amongst themselves and provision had to be made for the
children&#8217;s
accommodation elsewhere both in a home and during the holidays
with the grandparents. In the last period it was no doubt because
of the cramped
accommodation in the father&#8217;s home. In my view given that this pattern
applied over quite a number of years
the dependency I think could be described
as more than minimal or perhaps significant. Accordingly I am satisfied that the
plaintiff
is an eligible person.<br><br>34 It is also necessary if the Court is
to make an order in favour of the plaintiff that it should be satisfied as
required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s9(1)</a> of the Act that there are factors warranting the making of the
application. In<b> Re Fullop Deceased </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 679</a> at 681 McLelland J
as he then was said the following:-<br><br>&#8220;Since the sub-section applies
only to certain classes of applicants, it suggests that these classes of
applicants need to demonstrate
some basis for their claims additional to that
required of other classes. The difference between the two sets of classes of
applicants,
in broad terms, seems to be that the classes not affected by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s9(1)(lawful</a> and defacto spouses and children) are as such generally regarded as
natural objects of testamentary recognition by a deceased (Cf
<b>The Wills
Probate Administration Act </b>1898, s61B), whereas the classes affected by
s9(1) (former spouses, and some time dependent grandchildren or household
members) are
as such not generally so regarded. This suggests that the
&#8220;factors&#8221; referred to in the subsection are factors which when
added
to facts which render the applicant an &#8216;eligible person&#8217; give him or
her the status of a person who would be generally
regarded as a natural object
of testamentary recognition by the deceased.&#8221;<br><br>35 In the present
case two areas of evidence emerged which, leaving aside the contact between the
plaintiff and the deceased which
I have referred to above, suggests that the
plaintiff has established the factors warranting the making of the application.
The first
of these concerns statements by the deceased about her testamentary
intentions. <br><br>36 The first of these statements was said by the plaintiff
to have occurred on Christmas Day in December 1996. The plaintiff and the
defendant were present and the deceased in conversation according to the
plaintiff said, &#8220;My will states that everything is
to go to Anthony but
everything is to be divided equally between you&#8221;. According to the
plaintiff the defendant replied with
words to the effect, &#8220;Yes, Grandma,
I&#8217;ll do it&#8221;. This conversation is denied by the defendant. I have
also earlier
referred to Mrs Simmonds a friend of the deceased and she gave
evidence of two conversations when reference was made to property.
The first is
somewhat ambivalent and it may relate to a transfer but the second indicates
clearly testamentary intention. The deceased
apparently relayed to Mrs Simmonds
a discussion she had had with a solicitor about costs of wills and putting more
people in the
will which is somewhat improbable. However, the conversation
indicated that the plaintiff was relying in leaving her property to
Anthony on
his promise to look after Jasmine. Also in this period after the death of the
deceased&#8217;s husband there were discussions
between the plaintiff and two of
her friends and the deceased. One of them, Mr Grima, gave evidence of a
statement made at lunch
time by the deceased that when she died the house was to
pass to Jasmine and Anthony. The parties&#8217; father gave evidence that
about
3 months before her death the deceased said that she was going to leave
everything to Anthony because if she gave it to Jasmine
her savings would be
spend on the wind. For present purposes I think the most important evidence is
that of Gail Maree Savage. She
was a home carer assistant looking after the
deceased between 1994 and 1997. As she was an independent person who was able to
observe
the coming and going of the plaintiff and the defendant to the
deceased&#8217;s house and the effect that had upon the deceased.
She reported
one conversation when the deceased said in February 1996 after the making of the
will, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave
the property in Anthony&#8217;s name. For
I know he will look after Jasmine. Anthony says that Jasmine is irresponsible
with money,
her life is a mess and she couldn&#8217;t look after herself. I know
that Anthony will look after her.&#8221;<br><br>37 Even putting the
deceased&#8217;s intentions at this level which I am quite happy to accept it
indicates that the deceased was
concerned that there should be some provision
for Jasmine and that she was trusting, no doubt based upon statements made to
her by
Anthony, that he would take appropriate care of Jasmine and that she
would receive something. This to my mind indicates that the
deceased regarded
the plaintiff as a natural object of testamentary beneficence as she was
actively considering how to make provision
for her. <br><br>38 The other area is
the question of the help and assistance provided by the plaintiff to the
deceased. <br><br>39 An overall consideration of the evidence tends to suggest
that both parties visited the deceased over the years from 1992 to her
death.
Evidence was given by Mrs Savage of the reports made by the deceased to her
about the plaintiff helping and she observed when
the plaintiff was staying her
cleaning the house and undertaking household chores and maintenance. There was
also an occasion when
the plaintiff attended with some friends and spent many
hours cleaning out either the garage or a storeroom. I record that the defendant
himself also, not at the same time, but on other occasions was involved in this
cleaning and clearing out work. Although it is not
a matter of a total care for
the deceased it was at least some assistance to her. The deceased had the
assistance of Home Care who
also managed the mowing of her lawns and other
matters about the house.<br><br>40 If one stands back and puts into context the
relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased and bears in mind the
periods
of time during the plaintiff&#8217;s upbringing that she was dependent
upon the deceased, one can see that she was not a mere stranger
but someone who
could be described as a natural object of testamentary recognition. Accordingly,
I am satisfied that there are factors
warranting the making of the
application.<br><br>41 In applications under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> </b>the
High Court has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out
the two stage approach that a Court must take. At page 209 it said the
following:-<br><br>"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for
the applicant 'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and
advancement in life'? The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in all
the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for the
applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty. <br>The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves
similar considerations. Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may
need to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and
what is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark
upon the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant. In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court could
refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper maintenance.
Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's arrangements
to pay creditors."<br>42 As required by the High Court I turn to consider the
plaintiff&#8217;s situation. She is a single woman aged 28 years of age and
has
no dependents. She shares rented accommodation and contributes to the rent of
those premises. She works at Woolworths on the
night shift on a casual basis and
apparently on the latest information before the Court was earning $300 to $350 a
fortnight. The
difference between what she receives and the Social Security
payments is made up by Social Security the amount of which is not clear
on the
evidence. She pays rent of $85 a week and $25 for food and her transportation
expenses are approximately $40 a week. <br><br>43 So far as her assets are
concerned the only ones that she has are her clothes, a bedroom suite, an
antique record player a television
and a microwave oven. She has no car or real
estate. The plaintiff does not have skills apart from some computer course she
has undertaking
at Skill Share at Blacktown. She is registered to obtain
unemployment and I accept she has been trying to obtain a job. There was
some
suggestion that she was doing work on a cash basis with a friend but I do not
accept that this is happening. The friend pays
her fares and perhaps takes her
to lunch occasionally in return for some clerical work. The plaintiff is in good
health although
she has in the past had difficulties. Her employment for the
future is not secure and it is perfectly obviously that she has absolutely
nothing behind her.<br><br>44 I have above dealt with the relationship between
the plaintiff and the deceased and I will not repeat it. <br><br>45 It is of
course only appropriate for the court to make an order if the Court is satisfied
that the plaintiff has been left without
adequate and proper provision for her
maintenance, education or advancement in life. In this case the plaintiff has
not articulated
in her affidavit evidence the way in which she says appropriate
provision should be made. There is nothing to suggest that she wishes
to
undertake further courses nor it is suggested that there is a particular asset
which she wishes to purchase or she considers should
be provided. In this regard
I am reminded by what was said by Sheller JA in the Court of Appeal in Singer v
Berghouse on 23 July
1992. There his Honour had the following to
say:-<br><br>"Sheller JA (Cripps JA agreeing) said: 'I must say that I find it
extraordinary that the appellant presented scant or no evidence
as to her
present income and outgoings or as to her intentions or needs for the future or
as to what lump sum provision applying
appropriate discount tables would be
required to meet these claims or needs, if they existed. In my opinion, in the
circumstances
of this case, for the court, in the absence of any such evidence,
to make an order for the payment to the appellant of a lump sum
is to do no more
than act on speculation and, contrary to the prohibition contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s9(2)</a> of
the Act, to alter the deceased's disposition of his property in the absence of
proof that he has inadequately provided for the
appellant.'"<br><br>46 However
notwithstanding this total absence of evidence some things do stand out about
the plaintiff and that is that she has a
difficult employment situation and has
nothing behind her. Some start in life at this age may well help her to change
the course
of her life.<br><br>47 It is also of course necessary to consider
others having a claim on the bounty of the testator. The only relevant person in
this
category is the defendant. The defendant is now a single man and he has no
dependents. He is in regular employment earning $31,000
gross which amounts to
$596.15 per week. This is expended on his outgoings in respect of his living
expenses, his car and home. As
I have earlier mentioned he has a property at 18
Ferndale Close, Wentworthville, worth $230,000 and a Toyota Starlet car worth
$14,000.
He has a home loan of $107,000 and a personal loan from Westpac in the
amount of $4,000. He is 26 years of age and in good health.
<br><br>48 Some of
the relationship between the defendant and the deceased I have touched upon
earlier in this judgment. It is apparent that
he spent even more time with the
deceased than the plaintiff given the period when he was residing full time with
the deceased during
his high school education. I do not doubt that although he
moved away in 1992 that the defendant was of assistance to the deceased
particularly after her husband died.<br><br>49 I have already indicated that the
estate has been distributed to the defendant. Under s 24 the Court may designate
as notional
estate property if the Court is satisfied that an order for
provision ought to be made on the application. Accordingly, it is necessary
to
decide this question.<br><br>50 The plaintiff certainly has a need for some
provision to give her a start in life. She was perhaps not quite in the same
position
as the defendant who seems to have spent more time in his formative
years with the deceased. Importantly the plaintiff is not in
a secure financial
situation in contrast to the defendant. Leaving aside questions which arise
under sections 27 and 28 and taking
into account the amount of the estate, the
relationship between the two parties and the deceased and their personal
situation, I
think it would be appropriate for some order for provision to be
made on the plaintiff&#8217;s application. <br><br>51 The only relevant property
which the Court could designate as notional estate is the property into which
the deceased&#8217;s estate
has been translated, namely, the defendant&#8217;s
residence at 18 Ferndale Close, Wentworthville. Under s 28 the Court cannot
designate
property as notional estate unless it is satisfied that the estate is
insufficient to make the appropriate provision. This is the
case in the present
matter. It also under s 28 shall not make an order designating as notional
estate property in excess of that
necessary to allow the making of provision
that in a Court&#8217;s opinion should be made.<br><br>52 More important in this
case are the provisions of s 27 of the Act which are in the following
terms:-<br><br>"(1) On an application in relation to a deceased person, the
Court shall not make an order designating property as notional estate
of the
deceased person unless it has considered: <br>(a) the importance of not
interfering with reasonable expectations in relation to property; <br><br>(b)
the substantial justice and merits involved in making or refusing to make the
order; and <br><br>(c) any other matter which it considers relevant in the
circumstances. <br><br>(2) In determining that property should be designated as
notional estate of a deceased person, the Court shall have regard to:
<br><br>(a) the value and nature of property the subject of any relevant
prescribed transaction or distribution from the estate of the deceased
person;
<br><br>(b) where, in relation to any such prescribed transaction, consideration
was given, the value and nature of the consideration; <br><br>(c) any changes
over the time which has elapsed since any such prescribed transaction was
entered into, any such distribution was
made or any such consideration was given
in the value of property of the same nature as the property the subject of the
prescribed
transaction, the distribution or the consideration, as the case may
be; <br><br>(d) whether property of the same nature as the property the subject
of any such prescribed transaction, any such distribution or any
such
consideration could, during the time which has elapsed since the prescribed
transaction was entered into, the distribution was
made or the consideration was
given, as the case may be, have been applied so as to produce income; and
<br><br>(e) any other matter which it considers relevant in the
circumstances."<br>53 Under s 27(1)(a) the Court has to consider the importance
of not interfering with the reasonable expectations in relation to the
property.
Such reasonable expectations may well occur in a number of circumstances. For
example, a beneficiary who receives a property
may have spent money on the
property or worked on the property. In the present case this is not applicable
as the only matters that
the defendant has attended to is helping and cleaning
up rubbish in the yard. Another common area where one often sees in this matter
is where there is a promise in relation to the property and the acting by an
intended beneficiary on the fact of that promise. An
example is a promise to
leave a property provided someone works hard for many years to assist the
testator. <br><br>54 In the present case none of these circumstances appear and
importantly the defendant gives no evidence of any reasonable expectation.
<br><br>55 Under s 27(1)(b) a Court has to consider the substantial justice and
merits involved when making or refusing to make the order.
In this case this is
of some importance. The defendant has given evidence that he cannot borrow any
more on the property because
his salary will not support a higher level of
borrowing. He has in fact taken out a personal loan of some $4,000 which was
necessary
for him to fund his defence of the litigation. Another matter that has
to be considered is the impact of costs as a result of the
application. Although
if the defendant were successful he would probably be entitled to an order for
costs against the plaintiff.
It is clear that the plaintiff has no funds from
which to pay such costs. Accordingly, the defendant, even if successful in the
action
is likely to have to bear his own costs. He may be able to do so from
other assets because he owns a car worth some $14,000. However,
it seems to me
that it is highly likely that if the plaintiff is successful the defendant will
have to sell the property. Not only
will he have to meet the legacy which the
Court considers appropriate but also costs of the plaintiff.<br><br>56 Under s
27(1)(c) the Court must consider any other matter which it considers relevant in
the circumstances. There was tendered
on the defendant&#8217;s behalf the
publication of the Notice under s 35 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></b>. As I
have mentioned above the deceased died on 22 February 1997, Probate was granted
19 June 1997, Notice of Intended Distribution
was published on 30 June 1997 and
after the sale of the property the defendant purchased a house on 28 November
1997. Thereafter
it was not until 14 July 1998 that the Summons was issued. It
was of course within the time allowed under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the Act. I did not have the
benefit any submissions from the defendant as to what weight I should place upon
the publication of
the Notice of Intended Distribution. No doubt the defendant
considered that the publication of the notice assisted its case in resisting
the
designation of property as notional estate. The Notice of Intended Distribution
is in the appropriate form for the purposes of
s 35 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a></b>, s 60 of<b> The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a> </b>and s 92 of <b>The Wills and Probate and
Administration Act</b>. Section 35 of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></b> is in the
following terms:-<br><br>&#8221;(1) Where the administrator of the estate of a
deceased person has given notices in the manner and form prescribed by rules
of
court of his intention to distribute the property in the estate after the
expiration of a specified time, he may, at the expiration
of the time specified
in the notices or, as the case may require, in the last of the notices,
distribute that property having regard
only to the applications in relation to
the deceased person of which he has notice at the time of the distribution.
</div>
<div>(2) An administrator who distributes property in the estate of a deceased
person in accordance with subsection (1) is not liable in
respect of that
property to any person of whose application in relation to the deceased person
he did not have notice at the time
of the distribution.&#8221;<br>57 Section 35
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> applies to "applications". By virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(2)</a>
this means "an application to the court for an order for provision..." On the
face of it this would not include what might be called
potential claims proposed
to be made under the act. As applications to the court are made by a summons
joining the executor as defendant
(Part 77 rule 55 and 60) in practical terms
the section can only be referring to applications where proceedings have been
commenced
but not yet served on the defendant executor. <br><br>58 This
construction is supported by the use of the word in other parts of the act. For
example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a>, 27, 28 and, more importantly, s 31. This last section refers
to the "right to make an application" when dealing with releases. A
reference to
the working paper (1974) and report ( 1977) of the Law Reform Commission shows
the predecessor of the section as clearly
applying to proceedings which had been
commenced. <br><br>59 It can be noted that because of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(4)</a> of the Act a court,
when it comes to deal with an application, can, so far as the estate of the
deceased person is concerned, only
make an order out of the amount of that
estate which remains undistributed at the date of the order. Thus for example
one cannot
have a situation where the court gives a specific bequest of a
particular property, which cannot be satisfied because of an earlier
distribution of that property. The protection given by s 35(2) seems to be a
protection against some personal liability towards an
eligible person whose
claim has been defeated by the actions of the executor in the sense that the
court is not able to make an order
because of the distribution. This seems to be
a different personal liability from that to which s 60 and s 92 is directed,
namely,
a liability to a beneficiary on a devastavit or to a creditor on the
legal representative's personal liability for the debts of the
deceased to the
extent of the estate assets. <br><br>60 What then is the situation if one has an
executor who has notice of a proposed claim shortly after the date of death. He
advertises
and then distributes, say six months after the date of death.
Proceedings are commenced after six months but within 18 months and
at the
hearing the court, because of the distribution, either refuses the application
or substantially reduces the application. In
these circumstances might the
executor still have a personal liability from which he is not protected by s
35(2) as that section
in terms only applies to applications not proposed
applications? <br><br>61 This depends upon the nature of the personal liability
which an executor might have which is recognised in s 35. That liability
cannot
be based upon a liability to a beneficiary. This is because the applicant will
only become a beneficiary (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14)</a> if there is a successful application. There
cannot be a successful application if the property has been distributed because
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(4).</a> <br><br>62 The Law Reform Commission report and the Parliamentary
debates do not elucidate what is the basis of this personal liability. The
section seems to be a carry over from ss 11 and 12 of the Testators Family
Maintenance and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act 1916</a>. That act did not have an
equivalent to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(3)</a> provided for a
certified copy of the order to be attached to the probate. The entitlement to
the benefit of the court's order seems
to be based upon the order itself, not a
status as a beneficiary. See <b>Union Fidelity Trustee Co of Aust Ltd v
Montgomery</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1976%201%20NSWLR%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1976 1 NSWLR 134.</a> <br><br>63 As can be seen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> refers to
applications. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 11</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a> of the Act were in the following terms:-
<br><br>"11(1)Where an executor or administrator has given such or the like
notices as in the opinion of the court before which an application
under this
Act is made would have been given by the Supreme Court in its equitable
jurisdiction in an administration suit for creditors
and others to send in to
the executor or administrator their claims against the estate of the testator or
intestate, as the case
may be, such executor or administrator may, at the
expiration of the time named in the said notices, or the last of the said
notices,
for sending in such claims, distribute the assets of the testator or
intestate, as the case may be, or any part thereof, amongst
the persons entitled
thereto, having regard to any application under this Act of which such executor
or administrator has then notice.
<br>(2) Such executor or administrator shall
not be liable for the assets, or any part thereof, so distributed to any person
of whose
application under this Act he has not had notice at the time of such
distribution. <br><br>(3) Nothing in this section shall prevent the court from
ordering that any provision under this Act shall be made out of any assets
so
distributed. <br><br>12. An executor of a testator who has died prior to the
passing of this Act shall not under any circumstances be liable to any person
claiming under this Act in respect of any assets which such executor has
lawfully distributed prior to the passing of this Act."
<br>64 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12</a> might
reflect a concern that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> made it clear that there was a personal liability on
an executor. <br><br>65 Two cases give an indication of the basis of the
personal liability. The first of these is <b>Guardian Trust of New Zealand v
Public Trustee Ltd</b> ( <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1942/1942_1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1942] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1942%29%20AC%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1942) AC 115.</a> This was a case where there was a
distribution pursuant to a grant after notice that an application may be made to
revoke the grant.
The grant was later revoked. The Privy Council at p127 said
the following:- <br><br>"There does not appear to be any statute in force in New
Zealand that governs the case. It falls, therefore, to be decided in accordance
with the well established principles of equity. One of those principles is that
if a trustee or other person in a fiduciary capacity
has received notice that a
fund in his possession is, or may be, claimed by A, he will be liable to A if he
deals with the fund in
disregard of that notice should the claim subsequently
prove to be well founded. This principle has, indeed, been recognised by the
New
Zealand legislature in dealing with cases which are closely akin to the present
one." <br><br>66 Of importance is the reference to notice of potential claims.
<br><br>67 In <b>Re Simpson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%20CH%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) CH 38</a> at 42.43 Vaisey J who was concerned
with an application under the Inheritance (Family Provisions) Act 1938 made the
following observations:-
<br><br>"If these legacies have been paid, as I
understand they have, the matter comes before me in a form which adds further
embarrassment
to an already embarrassing jurisdiction. I wish to be distinctly
understood - I have said it before and I say it again, and I hope
some notice
will be taken of it - that where an application under the Inheritance (Family
Provision) Act, 1938, is either pending
or impending, that is to say, during the
first six months after grant of representation, if it is a case in which there
is any risk
of such a thing happening, the executor distributes the estate at
his risk. If beneficiaries come and pester him and say that they
want their
legacies and pressure is put on other beneficiaries to allow these anticipatory
payments to be made, in my judgment it
is the duty of the executor to resist any
such pressure. I think it must be said that where the court has to deal with a
matter under
this Act the estate should be there intact . Of course, duties and
debts, and that sort of thing, can be paid - there is no question
about that -
but no distribution to beneficiaries should be made while there is any
possibility or expectation that an application
under this Act will be made."
<br><br>68 The six months His Honour is referring to is the period allowed for
an application under the act. Noticeable again is the reference
to " possible"
claims. The English Act did not have a provision in the nature of s 35. These
comments have been referred to with
approval by McGregor J in Re Winwood  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20NZLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959)
NZLR 246</a> and in <b>Re Gimblett</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20NZLR%20664" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) NZLR 664.</a> In the second case he
considered that an executor who distributed with undue haste before the
expiration of the period allowed for
claims under the Act would incur a personal
liability to an applicant even if he had no notice of a potential claim. At p
666 he
said:- <br><br>"Under the provisions of the Family Protection Act s 9 a
party claiming the benefit of the Act is entitled to make application within
a
period of twelve months from the date of the grant in New Zealand of
administration in the estate. By s 10(2) of the Act no action
shall lie against
the administrator by reason of his having distributed any part of the estate, if
the distribution was properly
made by the administrator after the expiration of
six months from the date of the grant of administration in the estate of the
deceased,
and without notice of any application or intended application under
this Act in respect of the estate. In the present case, although
the
administrators had no notice of any application or intended application under
the Act, the estate was distributed before the
expiration of six months from the
date of the grant of administration. The provision is a negative provision, but
in view of the
fact that an applicant has a period of twelve months from the
grant of administration to make application it seems to me that it
was improper
in the circumstances that here exist for the administrators to distribute the
estate before the expiration of the period
of six months from the date of grant
of administration without prior notice to the widow and without full particulars
being given
to her of the assets. Reference can also be made to subs (6) of this
section, although it is not fully applicable, whereby the Court
is empowered,
where the administrator has made a distribution which cannot be disturbed under
the provisions of this Act, to make
an order in respect of the assets or to make
an order that any person to whom the assets were distributed pay to any
applicant a
sum not exceeding the value of the assets." <br><br>69 This personal
liability was referred to by Master Windeyer, as he then was, in <b>Heuston v
Barker</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 354</a> at 362 but the question was not decided by him in
that suit. The Master does not seem to have been referred to the authorities I
have referred to above. <b>Dickey on Family Provision After Death</b> at p 178
et seq refers to the problem and a number of other authorities in support of the
personal liability. <br><br>70 After the English and New Zealand decisions I
have referred to there were changes to acts in a number of jurisdictions. See s
99A
of the Victorian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/aapa1958259/" class="autolink_findacts">Administration and Probate Act 1958</a> and s 93 of the
Queensland Succession Acts Amendment Act of 1968 which merely adopted the New
Zealand provisions referred to in <b>Re Gimblett</b>. Those provisions allow
early distribution in respect of dependants, distributions with consent and a
distribution provided there
is no notice of an intended claim after six months,
the time for applications being 12 months. Section 35 has been enacted in a
state
of the law which recognised that there was a personal liability on an
executor if he distributed an estate before the time for making
claims under the
Act had expired. That this is so is demonstrated by the terms of s 17 which is
as follows:-<br><br>&#8220;(1) On an application made to the Court by the
administrator of the estate of a deceased person or by any other person who,
in
the opinion of the Court, has sufficient interest in proceedings in respect of
the estate or notional estate of a deceased person,
the Court may, if it is
satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is
reasonable to make an order under
this section, order that, in respect of an
application in relation to the deceased person by a specified person, the period
within
which the application shall be made shall be such period (being a period
expiring before the expiration of the period of 18 months
after the death of the
deceased person) as the Court specifies. <br>(2) An application by a person
under this section all not be deemed to be an admission by the person of any
matter for any purpose.<br><br>(3) An administrator shall not be regarded as
being under any duty to make an application under this section.&#8221;<br>71 In
this respect the Law Reform Commission saw this procedure as avoiding a not
uncommon problem of vague threats of action by aggrieved
next of kin which
remain unpursued with the result that the Executors cannot prudently distribute
until after the expiration of the
time for applications under the Act, sometimes
to the detriment of needy beneficiaries.<br><br>72 In this case there is no
evidence that the defendant was given notice of a proposed claim by the
plaintiff prior to the distribution.
<br><br>73 He was not cross-examined on
whether he expected that the plaintiff might make a claim but in any event it
would seem that he would
have a personal liability as a result of the
distribution. Accordingly on the proper construction of s 35 it cannot be said
that
he should have some favourable consideration because a Notice of Intended
Distribution has been published.<br><br>74 On the contrary, s 17 provides a
mechanism for him to achieve such protection. The only possible claimants in
this case could have
been his sister or his mother. He did not take the
opportunity of making an application and therefore was at risk of the effects
of
an application.<br><br>75 If one takes this factor into account along with the
matters I have mentioned when considering the justice and the merits, there
is
no reason why an order should not be made designating his home as notional
estate to the extent necessary. There are no particular
matters which need
consideration under 27(2).<br><br>76 The plaintiff has sought a legacy of
$50,000. In my view an appropriate provision, bearing in mind the lack of
evidence, is $30,000.<br><br>77 I order that:- <br>1. The property 18 Ferndale
Close, Wentworthville be designated as notional estate to the extent necessary
to meet the legacy in order
2 and the costs in order 3.<br><br>2. The plaintiff
receive out of the notional estate of the deceased a legacy of
$30,000.<br><br>3. I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff&#8217;s costs on a
party and party basis.<br><br>4. I give liberty to apply for further enforcement
of these orders or any necessary ancillary orders.<br><br>5. Interest is not to
run on the legacy in paragraph 2 until the expiration of two months from
today&#8217;s date.</P>
