<b><u>70021/98  -   REGINA  v   ADONIS KHOUZAME</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b> </b>On 11 August 1999 Adonis (Eddie)
Khouzame was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter of Caglar
Vurangunes and guilty
of assaulting Gokhan Kumru occasioning him actual bodily
harm.
<P>

2   	It is necessary to find facts consistent with those
verdicts of the jury for the purpose of sentence.  I am aware of course
that
the evidence contained a variety of versions and details of events and the
following refers to matters about which I am satisfied
to the requisite
criminal standard of proof.
<P>

3   	In the late afternoon of Sunday 9 November 1997 three
teenaged boys, the victims whose names I have mentioned and Erdinc (Eddie)
Tustas arrived in North Street Guildford in a motor car owned by Gokhan Kumru's
mother.  The boys were of Turkish ethnicity.  At
least one of them was
acquainted with Sarah Dawson, a girl who lived in a house in that street.  The
exact order of comings and goings
is confused but some social exchange took
place between the boys and Sarah Dawson as well as with other girls who were
passing in
the street, Ruby Raad and Lisa McCoy.  At some stage the prisoner's
sister Ashty Khouzame was in the vicinity.  I should state that
I do not accept
Ashty Khouzame as a witness of truth. Whilst the motive of the boys for their
presence was undoubtedly flirtatious,
I find that nothing was said or done by
any of them towards any girl which could reasonably be regarded as offensive or
provocative.
 I note that to a large extent Eddie Tustas remained aloof.  
<P>

4   	Ruby Raad resided in the house next door to the prisoner
and his family.  Although just under sixteen years of age, she was
engaged to
be married.  Her ten year old brother Mohammed took some objection to his
sister's conversing with the visiting males.
 He threatened to tell her fiance.
Truthfully he could tell that person no more than that his sister was part of a
group of boys
and girls chatting with each other in a public street in daylight
hours.  However, the boy Mohammed entered upon the prisoner's premises
and
began calling out loudly and his behaviour attracted the prisoner to the front
balcony of the upper storey of the house.  
<P>

5   	Verbal abuse came to be exchanged between the prisoner on
the balcony and the visitors who remained outside of the premises
in the
street.  The prisoner testified that in part of the exchange he offered the
mild reproof  "can you leave my sister and cousin
alone and leave".  I do not
accept that the prisoner made such a genteel request but even in that version
of his there is implication
that his state of mind included a desire for the
visitors to egress from the area.  I prefer as more credible the recounting of
Gokhan
Kumru who testified:
<P>

"He looked down towards me and he said, `Get the fuck out of here', this and
that, and I answered back to him and I said, `What's
your problem mate?' and he
said, `I'll show you my problem', and he come down."
<P>

6   	The prisoner did not claim that there had been any
preceding complaint from any one of the girls nor that he had observed any
one
of the visiting boys misconduct himself nor had he seen them do anything which
would cause apprehension that they were about
to misconduct themselves.  I am
satisfied that no one of the girls had told him that any attention being paid
to her was unwelcome.
 Ruby Raad was not the prisoner's cousin nor does the
evidence suggest that her fiance was a member of his family.  The prisoner
and
Ruby Raad shared a Lebanese ethnicity.
<P>

7   	I am satisfied that the prisoner perceived that the boys
were not going to depart immediately and that he formed an intention
to drive
them away.  He descended to the front door where he stripped off his upper
garment.  This was not a peacemaking gesture.
 The prisoner armed himself with
a piece of wood which apparently had been used as a garden stake.  I am
satisfied that the items
admitted into evidence are the component parts of that
piece of wood.  The label of garden stake should not give any false impression
about the substantial nature of the implement which the prisoner chose to
wield.
<P>

8   	With this implement the prisoner struck Caglar Vurangunes a
blow to the head, the force of which brought him to his knees and
caused the
damage which set in train ultimate fatality.
<P>

9   	A number of the prisoner's male relatives emerged from the
house in close order behind him.  His brother Joseph attacked Gokhan
Kumru and
the prisoner (and possibly others) joined in.  That victim sustained injuries
including a bloodied and swollen face and
bruising on the arm and back.  The
victims made their way to the car which was driven away.  Joseph Khouzame had
by then acquired
the wood and struck the departing car a blow which broke it
into pieces.  The foregoing are basic relevant facts.  The evidence of
course
contained a host of peripheral details many of which were the subject of
contradiction.  It is not necessary to resolve inessential
disputes.
<P>

10   	Another brother of the prisoner, Brian Khouzame tried to
restrain his brothers.  Shortly after the departure of the car he,
the prisoner
together with other male members of his family approached Mrs Dawson and her
daughter Sarah who were near their home
further down the street.  Mrs Dawson
testified "they just all came marching up to me, a whole group of men and I was
very frightened."
  Brian Khouzame addressed Sarah Dawson including the words
"Don't bring any fucking Turks into the street".  This circumstance is
not an
element in any crime for which the prisoner stands to be punished but his
undissenting presence whilst his brother made this
statement does nothing to
contradict the conclusion that I have reached that he had formed an intention
to drive the visiting youths
away from the street.  Save the rantings of a ten
year old boy the prisoner had been given no cause to form such an intention.
<P>

11   	At trial the prisoner claimed that he feared attack from
the youths and that he had armed himself with the wooden piece and
fanned it in
front of him in self defence.  He claimed that the victim sustained injury to
his head when he intruded himself into
the arc in which the waving wood
travelled.  I do not accept that anything of the sort happened nor that the
blow  was preceded by
mutual pushing and shoving between the prisoner and the
victim.
<P>

12   	At the sentence hearing it was argued that I should find
that the prisoner struck only a single blow rather than accept testimony
of
some witnesses who spoke of multiple blows being struck by the prisoner.  As I
have found, the blow struck by the prisoner brought
the youth to his knees and
I infer that the prisoner was well aware that he was thereafter at no real risk
of retaliation from him.
 For the purposes of sentence I accept that it is only
proved beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner struck one blow to Caglar
Vurangunes but it was a blow which is adequately described by common parlance
as a "king hit".   
<P>

13   	I record that I also reject the prisoner's version that
his contact with Gokhan Kumru was initiated by the latter placing
him in a head
lock.
<P>

14   	The jury's verdict demonstrated that they were not
satisfied that the prisoner intended to do grievous bodily harm to Caglar
Vurangunes and I approach the issue of sentence on the basis that the killing
was the consequence of an unlawful and dangerous act
by the prisoner, namely
the battery with the wood piece.  I do not ignore the post mortem measurement
which suggested the greater
than average vulnerability of the victim to a blow
to the head but this was not a case of a moderate blow causing unexpectedly
grave
damage, the violence  in this instance was a full bodied blow with a
substantial weapon.  
<P>

15   	I turn to some subjective matters.  The prisoner was aged
nineteen at the time of these offences.  I have read the report
of the
psychologist Ms Duffy concerning Mrs Vurangunes which was tendered as a victim
impact statement.  I have considered it as
required by Pt 6A of the Criminal
Procedure Act and I do not find it appropriate to use its content to affect the
determination of
punishment.
<P>

16   	The prisoner has no prior convictions.  He comes from a
close and supportive family.  He obviously impressed the probation
officer who
prepared the pre-sentence report as well as a psychologist Ms Robilliard.  Her
interpretation of test results was also
favourable although if, as she
assessed, his typical mood states demonstrate "warmth, tenderness, non
competitiveness and avoidance
of tension and conflict" she offers little
assistance for analysis of the violent pre-emptive strike which he undertook on
Sunday
9 November 1997.
<P>

17   	This brings me to a matter which has troubled me, namely
whether the prisoner has come to accept responsibility for what he
has done and
whether he is remorseful and contrite.  Of course, he is not obliged so to be
but it has been put that I should find
these matters in his favour and reflect
them in mitigation of sentence.  
<P>

18   	I have rejected, as necessarily did the jury, the
prisoner's claim of self defence but it is a useful guide to the reality
of his
recognition of responsibility to observe some matters concerning that claim.  I
raised the issue with counsel who asked me
to accept as I do, that many of the
letters of support tendered at the sentencing hearing had been obtained at the
behest of family
members when the issues of trial had not been determined.
Even so, Ms Robilliard, for example, saw the prisoner at Parklea on 9th
of this
month and she reported (inter alia)
<P>

 "he said it was the first fight he had had in his life and he was `frightened
and scared... I did not know what to do'. In his
own mind Adonis believes he
acted in self defence, however, he entertains profound remorse over the
victim's death.  He said he regularly
prays for the victim and the victim's
family as well as his own."
<P>

19   	I have found there was no fight antecedent to the
prisoner's arming himself with the piece of wood and the fact was that he
struck an essentially defenceless victim.  Although the prisoner has stated to
Ms Robilliard that he entertains remorse over the
victim's death, his
persistent claim of acting in self defence contradicts the proposition that he
has recognized his responsibility
for the death.
<P>

20   	Accepting that some of the testimonials were prepared
before verdict, it must also be observed that some bear dates subsequent
to it.
None of the authors of the letters comprising Exhibit 2 revealed any detailed
knowledge of the prisoner's act.  I do not propose
to analyse all twenty three
letters and two extracted samples will suffice for demonstration.  Mr El-Adhami
knew that the prisoner
had been convicted of manslaughter but asserted that he
did not believe that the prisoner was "capable of such an act".  The finding
of
the jury was otherwise.  This is a letter dated September 14th.  Mr Jad
Pavkovic whom I assume to be a relation of the prisoner's
fiancee Angela
Pavkovic stated that he (the prisoner) "does not deserve to be held in prison
for a crime he did not commit".  This
letter is dated September 4th.  The
content of the letters does not persuade me that the prisoner has profound
remorse for the victim's
death as opined by the psychologist.  It is of
interest to note that Mrs Tuma a witness called at the sentence hearing
understood
and still thought that "from what (she had) heard it was an act of
self defence".  She had apparently been at a court hearing in
1998 when self
defence was an issue being raised but she said the prisoner called her from
remand two weeks before giving evidence.
 He did not take the opportunity then
to alter her understanding.
<P>

21   	I accept the assertions in the various letters comprising
the exhibit mentioned that, these crimes apart, the prisoner is
a person of
good character.  They have not persuaded me that he is contrite for his
offences and I have concluded that he clings
to the myth that his action was
justified in whole or in part by some need for self defence.  The consequence
of that finding is
not, of course to increase sentence but I do not make the
finding invited by counsel that the prisoner has genuine remorse and contrition
so as to attract particular leniency.
<P>

22   	As I have said, the prisoner's prior good character is
supported by these referees together with the opinions of the probation
and
parole officer and the psychologist Ms Robilliard.  The combination promotes a
finding which I make that the prisoner is so far
as I can predict, unlikely to
re-offend.  In terms of the question of rehabilitation there should be a
determination favourable to
the prisoner. The need for sentence to reflect
personal deterrence is therefore of a low order.  
<P>

23   	The issue of general deterrence cannot be ignored.  The
prisoner did not speak the offensive words to Mrs Dawson that I have
quoted and
although he was present and in company at the time of their utterance, I do not
attribute to him the specific motive which
those words suggest but it was
nevertheless his intention to make the visitors quit the area.  Whatever was
the inspiration for the
confrontation outside the prisoner's house, his use of
a significant implement to assault an unarmed youth must meet with observable
condemnation.  The community would expect that such an assault leading to death
would attract an appropriate degree of punishment.
 
<P>

24   	During submissions it was said that of all crimes
manslaughter could be said to have the broadest spectrum of culpability
ranging
from what might be described as just beyond accident to just short of murder.
That situation can be said to be recognized
by s24 of the Crimes Act which
specifies a maximum penalty of twenty five years penal servitude for
manslaughter with a proviso that
a judge in an appropriate case for which
nominal punishment is deemed sufficient may discharge a jury from giving any
verdict.  In
my assessment the prisoner's crime of manslaughter lies at neither
extreme. I do not overlook the victim's particular vulnerability
but it is
repeated that the killing was in stark terms the result of an armed attack by
the prisoner.  
<P>

25   	I do not accede to the submission of counsel that a
sentence to be served by way of periodic detention would be appropriate.
<P>

26   	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> requires that the additional term
component of a  sentence not exceed one third of the minimum term unless there
are special circumstances.
 I consider that there are such circumstances which
justify extension of the additional term component during which the prisoner
will potentially be at conditional liberty on parole.  He is still a
comparatively young man being committed to custody on a first
occasion.  After
his release it is desirable that he have objective assistance over a
significant period from a person independent
of his close knit family to guide
him in accepting the reason for his incarceration and re-entering the community
with a mature and
appropriate attitude.  An officer of the Probation and Parole
Service would fulfil that role.  
<P>

27   	The prisoner was in custody for 38 days after being
charged and before being bailed.  He was returned to custody after the
jury's
verdict.  I will backdate the sentences to take account of these
circumstances.
<P>

28   	Adonis Khouzame for the manslaughter of Caglar Vurangunes,
you are sentenced to penal servitude for five years, such sentence
to consist
of a minimum term of three years commencing on 3 July 1999 and to expire on 2
July 2002, together with an additional term
of two years to commence on 3 July
2002.  
<P>

29   	For assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Gokhan
Kumru you are sentenced to a fixed term of penal servitude for three
months
commencing on 3 July 1999 and to expire on 2 October 1999.  That fixed term is
imposed as it is to be served concurrently
with part of the minimum term
component of the sentence just imposed for manslaughter.
<P>

30   	You will be eligible for parole on 2 July 2002.
<P>
