<b><u>REGINA   BARRY RUSSELL NARDONI</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b> Barry Russell Nardoni pleaded guilty
before me on indictment for manslaughter of Kylie Anne Neil.  
<P>

2   	The prisoner and the victim lived together in a de facto
relationship in a tiny bedsitter flat in what appears to be have been
a large
complex of such dwellings made available by the Housing Commission in
Northcliff Drive Warrawong.  As at 25 July 1997 the
prisoner was aged twenty
six and the victim aged eighteen.  They had commenced their association in
Victoria but had led a somewhat
nomadic existence which it is not necessary now
to detail but it appears that they had at least formed an intention to stay for
a
time in the Wollongong area.  They had some discussions with an acquaintance
who was in occupation of a two bedroom flat about whether
or not an exchange of
their accommodation might not be able to be arranged.  
<P>

3   	I am satisfied that the relationship between the parties
was substantially affected by the circumstance that neither of them
followed
any occupation and their time was largely spent imbibing intoxicating liquor
and partaking of marijuana.  The evidence leads
me to suspect that other
illicit substances may have been ingested from time to time but I am not
satisfied of this to the requisite
standard. 
<P>

4   	The violence of the prisoner towards Kylie Neil was
evidenced by his appearance at Port Kembla Local Court on 13 May 1997 where
he
was fined for an offence of malicious injury and, significantly, placed on a
recognizance to be of good behaviour for two years
and to accept the
supervision of the Parole and Probation Service for an assault upon Kylie Neil.
That recognizance was current at
the time of the killing.  It is convenient to
note at this point that the prisoner has a prior record including convictions
in Victoria,
Queensland and South Australia.  I do not regard his prior record
as trivial but many of the offences are of nuisance type and none
approach the
seriousness of the conviction on the current indictment.
<P>

5   	On Friday morning 25 July 1997 the prisoner and the victim
acquired a slab of beer and a bottle of Cougar brand whiskey and
began to drink
it.  They were joined towards midday by an acquaintance Norman Rausch who was
despatched to the supermarket later
to obtain a further ten bottles of beer
after the original supplies of liquor had been completely consumed.  By 5 pm in
the afternoon
or thereabouts I am satisfied that the parties could be described
as being in an alcoholic fog.  In that haze the prisoner became
inspired to
attack his de facto partner.  I am unable to determine exactly what provoked
his rage, if anything, but it is clear that
he was exercising no control over
his passion and violently attacking Kylie Neil.  Another acquaintance Rachael
Marrello was in a
nearby flat and, as did others, she heard the sounds of the
violent encounter.  She heard Kylie Neil saying "I am trying to talk
to you and
you just keep bashing me".  She heard screaming and she came to investigate.
She saw the prisoner striking the victim
on many occasions once causing her to
be forced into a screen door.  
<P>

6   	Rachael Marrello sought to rescue Kylie Neil.  The two
women quit the premises.  They were followed by Norman Rausch but Miss
Marrello
remonstrated with him and guided her to a women's refuge.  Miss Marrello urged
her to leave the prisoner but Miss Neil said
that she stayed with him because
he was faithful to her and did not "play up like other guys" with whom she had
kept company.  Miss
Marrello's comment was that nobody else would put up with
the prisoner.  
<P>

7   	Whilst at the refuge Miss Neil complained of having a
headache but understandably although tragically this was thought not
to be of
any great significance by the welfare worker who was present as there was the
history of the attack and it was obvious that
Miss Neil had consumed a
considerable quantity of intoxicating liquor.  She told people at the refuge
that she had remembered a place
where she could have some accommodation for the
night.  There was none available at the refuge. Police were called.  They
escorted
her to a police vehicle and took her to premises in Matthews Crescent,
Port Kembla.  On the way she told police that she had simply
had a blue with
her boyfriend.  It was apparent to police that she had been partaking of
intoxicating liquor but they did not assess
her as being abnormal in the sense
of displaying signs of injury or medical distress.
<P>

8   	The address at Port Kembla was in fact the flat belonging
to Norman Rausch with whom she and the prisoner had been drinking
earlier in
the day.  After Miss Neil had been dropped at the premises she encountered a
woman Linda Sheppheard who was in possession
of a key to the flat given to her
by Norman Rausch.  She was inside the flat with a friend Jason Collier.  Miss
Sheppheard answered
a knock on the door and saw Kylie Neil whom she gauged to
be intoxicated.  She identified herself as Barry's girlfriend - that is
to say
the girlfriend of the prisoner - and asked whether she could come in and wait
for Norm (Rausch).  She was told to wait outside
because Miss Sheppheard and Mr
Collier were going down the road.  By this time it was dark.  They left but
returned half an hour
later and found Kylie Neil still waiting in the foyer
crying.  In response to enquiry she said that Barry had belted her. She
complained
of a headache.  Miss Sheppheard invited her to lie on Mr Rausch's
bed until he came home and then she (Miss Sheppheard) lay down
on a mattress on
the floor and went to sleep.  Jason Collier was on a lounge near a window.  
<P>

9   	Some time in the middle of the night Norman Rausch came
home.  Miss Neil was moved from the bed but complained of cold and
of an aching
head.  She camped on the floor where she was covered with some clothing for
warmth.
<P>

10   	On the Saturday morning Miss Sheppheard awoke and
perceived that Kylie Neil was deceased.  She and Jason Collier separately
left
and advised Norman Rausch to ring an ambulance and the police.  This he did.
<P>

11   	Post mortem examination showed that there had been a head
injury to the right side of the face between the eye and the ear
which had
caused a depressed skull fracture as well as distortion of the brain and
tonsillar herniation.  The pathologist certified
head injury as a direct cause
of death,  the effects of cannabis and alcohol as other significant conditions
contributing to the
death.
<P>

12   	As I sought to emphasize at the sentencing hearing, I have
accepted the plea of guilty by the prisoner as indicating an acknowledgment
that an unlawful and dangerous act by him in battering the victim caused her
death and, in his presence, that acknowledgment was
affirmed by counsel.  It is
also important to bear in mind that the count in the indictment does not
involve any allegation of intent
by the prisoner to cause really serious
injury.
<P>

13   	It is not possible to identify any particular blow struck
by the prisoner which caused the death.  The prisoner accepts however
that it
was his attack upon her which was causative of the death and although his
memory of the events is fogged both by extravagant
consumption of intoxicating
liquor and later partaking in smoking of cannabis he has through his counsel
explicitly accepted that
I should look to the evidence of witnesses as to what
occurred rather than to his own recollection (possibly reconstructed) of milder
aggression such as he has described to police and other enquirers.
<P>

14   	An extract from a letter by the prisoner handed up at the
sentencing proceedings includes these statements:
<P>

"I understand completely the trouble I am in.  When I was told of Kylie's death
I was very shocked.  For the past two years, I have
pleaded my innocence.  I
know I was very drunk that day, and cannot remember exactly what happened.  But
when I heard or seen in
my police brief that a man who lived under the house
where she was found told of hearing two sets of four to five thumps on his
ceiling,
right at the time of death and when they said Kylie's g-string
underwear were on back to front, I just freaked out and thought the
worst. And
not to mention the different stories of the people that were in the house at
the time.  But now I have had time to think,
I really have no idea if Kylie
could have struck her head on anything.  My mind has been very clouded since
that day and because
I have admitted to assault I must stand up and take
responsibility for my action."
<P>

15   	I have made some obvious corrections to the text of the
letter.  The prisoner goes on to express his confidence in divine
omniscience
and justice.
<P>

16   	Some matters referred to in that text merit elaboration.
The reference to thumps on the ceiling is to a statement by a Mr
Goodyear who
was resident in the flat immediately below Mr Rausch that is to say in the flat
within which during the night the deceased,
Linda Sheppheard and Jason Collier
were present later joined by Norman Rausch himself.  There is nothing in the
material which would
enable determination of what exactly Mr Goodyear was
hearing.  Certainly Kylie Neil was at some stage moved from the bed onto the
floor but there was a separation in the group of noises and indeed they were so
loud that Mr Goodyear inserted ear plugs in order
to enable himself to sleep.
Jason Collier is now said to be also deceased.  A further statement from Linda
Sheppheard reveals that
about a week after the death she encountered Jason
Collier who revealed to her that he had slept with the victim on the night that
she died.  By his statement he obviously meant that he had had sexual
intercourse.  Post mortem examination had detected semen on
vaginal smears and
these had been subjected to DNA tests.  These tests affirmatively demonstrated
that the source could not have
been the prisoner.  
<P>

17   	It may be said that, given the prisoner's plea of guilty,
these circumstances are not now directly relevant but in my view
they add very
powerful enhancement to the value of the demonstration of contrition manifest
in the plea of guilty.  I do not think
it necessary for me to spell out why I
come to that view.  As I have indicated, I regard this as a case where a
finding of remorse
can be made and I make it with considerably more confidence
than could be the case if I were left to rely upon subjective matters
alone.

<P>

18   	That leads me to turn to some subjective matters
concerning the prisoner.  He had the disadvantage of early life in an unstable
family situation although within the community this is regrettably not unusual.
When the family split however, he for a time joined
his father who went to
England whilst his sisters remained with his mother.  In the course of time he
came back to Australia but
by the age of fourteen he was virtually living as an
itinerant moving from the streets into accommodation at charitable hostels and
the like.  He descended into alcoholism and very substantial use of marijuana.
He has claimed that any use of other drugs was no
more than experimental.
<P>

19   	By the time of the death of Kylie Neil the prisoner's life
was at a low ebb and his existence had a pointlessness about it.
 Kylie Neil
had joined him at that level and whilst I do not regard that as a matter of
culpability I believe he should recognize
and does recognize his responsibility
to an extent for that situation.
<P>

20   	I have seen the prisoner several times now in Court.  It
is difficult to coordinate his appearance with the descriptions of
him as at
mid 1997.  I have read the report of the psychologist Ms. Barrier and I note
her assessments of his personality traits.
 I am impressed with his assertions
of intent towards rehabilitation made to the probation and parole officer and I
find some support
for that impression in the conduct of the prisoner during a
period of bail during last year and until earlier this year.  He has
re-established contact with his mother who has remarried and settled in
Queensland.  Whilst on bail he resided with her and he obtained
employment in a
bakery manufacturing pies and seems to have diligently applied himself to that
employment.  It is his expressed hope
upon release to return to Queensland and
his mother has indicated her preparedness to have him.
<P>

21   	I consider the prisoner's prospects of successful
rehabilitation to be reasonable, indeed reasonably good but given his long
unpromising background, it is in my view desirable that he have an extended
period of close supervision whilst on parole.  For that
reason I hold that
there are special circumstances justifying the extension of the additional term
component of sentence beyond that
which would emerge from direct application of
the formula in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>.
<P>

22   	Despite these good impressions, I must not overlook that
life has been extinguished by the act of the prisoner and it is an
aggravating
circumstance that his offence was committed whilst on a recognizance which
specifically related to attack by him upon
her.  Whilst I do not regard his
prior record as gross, it disentitles him to leniency which might otherwise be
made available if
it did not exist.
<P>

23   	The prisoner was in custody from arrest on 30 July 1997
until released on bail on 4 February 1998.  He was returned to custody
on 18
April 1999 and has remained there.  Until today he has on my calculation been
in custody for one year and thirty two days.
<P>

24   	The total sentence imposed upon the prisoner must reflect
the objective seriousness of his offence but the orders made should
be such as
to encourage the prisoner to continue his seemingly remarkable efforts towards
rehabilitation.  I mention in that regard
that I take into account in his
favour the content of the letter from Reverend Richard Howarth.  I should also
record that I have
read the content of the victim impact statement but in
accordance with published authority I do not utilize its content to aggravate
my assessment of appropriate penalty.  
<P>

25   	I have come to the conclusion that in all the
circumstances an appropriate sentence is six years penal servitude.  This I
will reduce to five years to take into account previous custody.  I am
conscious that that period of pre-sentence custody exceeds
one year by thirty
two days. The assessment of six years represents a considerable reduction from
what I would regard as objectively
appropriate for the taking of life whilst in
a drunken rage.  My conclusion, taking all matters into account, is that I
should impose
a sentence of five years from today.
<P>

26   	Barry Russell Nardoni, for the manslaughter of Kylie Neil
you are sentenced to penal servitude for five years to consist of
a minimum
term of two years commencing today 12 November 1999 and to expire on 11
November 2001 together with an additional term
of three years to commence on 12
November 2001.
<P>

27   	You will be eligible for parole on 12 November 2001.
