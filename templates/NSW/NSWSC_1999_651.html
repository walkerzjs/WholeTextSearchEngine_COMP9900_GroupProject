<b>JUDGMENT NO. 28</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	On 26 May 1999, I gave certain rulings in relation to the
admissibility of evidence.  I said I would publish my reasons at
a later time.
These are my reasons.
<P>

2   	The accused's case included evidence that, on the night of
the stabbing of the deceased, 17-18 May 1997, the accused were transported
by
Mr Mahmoud Sleiman (a relative of the accused Emad Sleiman) in the latter's
Ford Laser motor car, registration number SLN 660.
 Mr Mahmoud Sleiman had
said, in evidence, that he had purchased the motor vehicle from a Mr Mansour
shortly before 17-18 May 1997.
<P>

3   	I gave the Crown leave to adduce evidence in question in a
case in reply, with a view to showing that the vehicle was, in fact,
elsewhere
that night, namely, at the Tienda Motel, The Entrance.  Evidence was adduced on
the voir dire for the purpose of the ruling.
 That evidence was as follows.
<P>

4   	Mrs Townsend, the daughter of the manager of the motel,
gave evidence that she was on duty on the night of 17-18 May 1997.
 She said it
was the practice of the motel and a practice which she followed for a
registration form to be filled out for each guest,
which included the name and
address of the guest, the registration number of the guest's motor vehicle, the
date of check in and
the charge for the room.  She said it was also the
practice and her practice to personally check the registration number of a
guest's
motor vehicle.  
<P>

5   	Mr P Baker, Mrs Townsend's father and the manager of the
motel at the relevant time, gave evidence that a search had been conducted
for
the relevant batch of registration forms, and they could not be found.  I was
satisfied that the form in question could not be
produced.
<P>

6   	Detective Senior Constable Trench gave evidence that, at
the request of Acting Detective Sergeant McNab, he attended at the
Tienda
Motel, The Entrance on 15 October 1997<b>,</b> where he inspected a
registration form relating to a stay at the motel by a Mr Mansour earlier in
1997.  He said that he recorded
the name, address, car registration, payment
details and dates from the form either on the fax which had been received from
Acting
Detective Sergeant McNab or on a separate sheet of paper. He said he was
able to give that evidence without refreshing his recollection
from any
document but not the detailed particulars of what he saw and recorded.
Detective Senior Constable Trench said that he faxed
his original note of those
particulars to Acting Detective Sergeant McNab or a typed up record of those
particulars.  He said he
had been unable to find the document faxed to Acting
Detective Sergeant McNab but was able to produce the cover sheet or header
relating
to the transmission.  That was tendered as an exhibit on the voir
dire.
<P>

7   	Acting Detective Sergeant McNab said in his evidence on the
voir dire that, having requested Detective Senior Constable Trench
to make
inquiries at the Tienda Motel and having received a reply from him, he (Acting
Detective Sergeant McNab) keyed in a running
sheet on 20 October 1997
incorporating the information he had received.  This document was produced and
tendered on the voir dire.
 It stated that the records of the Tienda Motel, The
Entrance, showed that some time on 17 May 1997 Cyril Mansour booked into the
motel, and that the registration number of his car was SLN 660.  (There was
other evidence tending to show that Mr Mansour had occupied
a room in the motel
on the night of 17-18 May 1997 and had checked out late on 18 May 1997.)
Acting Detective Sergeant McNab said
that he had searched for the document
faxed by Detective Senior Constable Trench and it could not be found.
<P>

8   	I held that the running sheet was admissible (in an edited
form incorporating the salient details) pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)(a)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48(4)(a)</a> provides that a party may adduce
evidence of the contents of a document that is not available to the party by
tendering a document
that is an summary of or an extract from the document in
question.
<P>

9   	I further held that Detective Senior Constable Trench
should have leave, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a>, to use the running sheet to try to revive
his memory.  That section provides that a witness must not, in the course of
giving evidence,
use a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact
or opinion unless the court gives leave.
<P>

10   	I further held that Detective Senior Constable Trench
could give oral evidence of what he saw in the registration form pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
48(4)(b)</a>, using the running sheet to refresh his recollection.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
48(4)(b)</a> provides that a party may adduce evidence of the contents of a
document that is not available to the party by adducing oral evidence
of the
contents of the document in question.
<P>

11   	I made it a condition of those rulings that the Crown lead
evidence in the trial as to the manner in which the documentation
came into
existence.  That was to give the accused the opportunity of bringing out any
matter adverse to the reliability of the chain
of proof of the contents of the
registration form.
<P>

12   	My reasons for these rulings were as follows.  It was
clear that the original of the registration form was a business record
of the
kind referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69</a> and that proof of the contents of the form would,
accordingly, be evidence of the fact.  It followed that, if the contents of the
form could be proved, that would stand as evidence that vehicle, registration
number SLN 660, was at the Tienda Motel, The Entrance,
with Mr Mansour
overnight on 17-18 May 1997 and, accordingly, had not been used to transport
the accused that night.
<P>

13   	That the registration form was a document not available to
the Crown, within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)</a>, was also clear on the evidence led on
the voir dire.
<P>

14   	I was satisfied that the running sheet was a summary of or
an extract from the registration form within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)</a> and was,
accordingly, admissible as evidence of the contents of the form pursuant to
that section.
<P>

15   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 32(2)</a> prescribes matters which the court is to
take into account in deciding whether to give leave to a witness to use a
document to refresh
the witness's recollection.  The matters specified are
expressed to be without limiting the matters that the court may take into
account.  The specified matters are:
<P>

"(a)	whether the witness will be able to recall the fact or opinion adequately
without using the document; and
<P>

(b)	whether so much of the document as the witness proposes to use is, or is a
copy of, a document that:
<P>

(i)	was written or made by the witness when the events recorded in it were
fresh in his or her memory; or
<P>

(ii)	was, at such a time, found by the witness to be accurate."
<P>

16   	Having regard to the evidence given on the voir dire, I
was satisfied that Detective Senior Constable Trench would be unable
to recall
the relevant content of the registration form without using the running sheet
to refresh his recollection.  That answered
para (a) above.
<P>

17   	As to paragraph (b) above, there are two relevant matters
to be stated.  First, there is a question as to whether the facts
of the case
come within the ambit of paragraph (b).  Whether they do is a matter which the
court is obliged to take into account.
 Secondly, the matter specified in
paragraph (b) is not a condition for the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32.</a>  It is a matter to
be taken into account and it is a matter to be taken into account without
limiting the matters that the court
may take into account in deciding whether
to give leave
<P>

18   	I was of the opinion that the facts of the case did not
come within the ambit of paragraph (b).  The running sheet was not
written or
made by Detective Senior Constable Trench.  Nor was it examined by the witness
and found to be accurate when the inspection
of the registration form was fresh
in his mind.  However, the document - purportedly and according to the evidence
- recorded what
Detective Senior Constable Trench had seen when he inspected
the registration form.  The kind of information recorded in the document
was
also important.  Relevantly, the only material content was a date, a name and
the registration number of a motor vehicle.  That
is not the kind of
information likely to be inaccurately transcribed or corrupted in transmission
from one police officer to another
in the course of a criminal investigation.
Evidence given by Detective Senior Constable Trench, using the document, was
likely to
be reliable.  Indeed, there was no serious doubt in my mind that the
running sheet accurately recorded what Detective Senior Constable
Trench had
seen in the registration form.
<P>

19   	In <i>Horne v MacKenzie</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1839/1007.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1839] EngR 1007</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281839%29%206%20Cl%20%26%20F%20628" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1839) 6 Cl &amp; Fin 628</a>, a
surveyor made notes at the time of an inspection.  Subsequently, he wrote up a
printed report from his notes, and he made jottings
on his copy of the report
reflecting other details in his notes which had not been incorporated in the
report.  Objection was taken
to the surveyor refreshing his recollection as to
what he had seen on the inspection from the printed report and the jottings.
The
trial judge ruled against the objection.  His Lordship said that the report
was "made from his (the surveyors') original notes, but
it is not a literal
transcript of them; but in substance it is the same".  On appeal, it was held
that the trial judge was right
to allow the witness to refresh his recollection
from the report and the jottings written on it. 
<P>

20   	The point of the decision is that the report and jottings
were not made at a time which was "contemporaneous" with the event,
that being
the terminology in which the common law rule was cast (now "fresh in the mind"
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32).</a>  
<P>

21   	In<i> Kwok Si Cheng</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2063%20Cr%20App%20R%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 63 Cr App Rep 20</a>, a police
officer was permitted, over objection, to refresh his memory from a statement
he had prepared from his note book.  The
note book was no longer available.  On
appeal, Lawton LJ said (at 24):
<P>

"What seems to us to be the position is this.  If the statement in this case,
or any other transcription of notes in other cases,
is substantially what is in
the notes and there is evidence to that effect, then the judge should allow the
witness to refresh his
memory from the statement or transcription as the case
may be.  But if, after investigation, it turns out that the statement or
transcription
bears little relation to the original note, then a different
situation arises.  The judge in the exercise of his discretion would
be
entitled to refuse to allow a witness to refresh his memory from such an
imperfect source of information."
<P>

22   	In both of the cases I have cited, the later document was
prepared by the maker of the original, contemporaneous notes.  I
do not see
why, however, there should be any difference in principle where the later
document is made by some other person, provided
that the later document
incorporates substantially the same information as appeared in the original
contemporaneous notes.  Factually,
that was so in the present case.
<P>

23   	Because the running sheet did in substance record the same
information as was recorded by Detective Senior Constable Trench
in his
original note of what he saw in the registration form and because that note was
made contemporaneously with his observation
of what appeared in the
registration form, it was appropriate to give the witness leave to use the
running sheet to revive his memory
of what he had seen in the registration
form, notwithstanding that the running sheet was not a document made by the
witness or found
by the witness to be accurate when his observation was fresh
in his memory.  
<P>

24   	In <i>Hadid v Australis Media Limited</i> (Judgment No 10,
1 November 1996, unreported), I refused to allow a witness to refresh his
recollection from notes of a conversation
made by another person.  I held that,
the notes not being within the ambit of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(2)(b)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> did not apply.  On
consideration, I think it would be wrong to hold, as a universal rule, that
there is no scope for the operation
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> without answering to the
considerations mentioned in para (b) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(2).</a>  (I<b> </b>would mention that
there was a second point in my judgment in <i>Hadid</i> - not presently
relevant - which provided an alternative reason for what was ultimately decided
there.)
<P>

25   	In the present case, for the reasons I have given, I
decided that oral evidence of the contents of the registration form could
be
given by Detective Senior Constable Trench, using the running sheet to revive
his memory of what he had observed when he inspected
it.
<P>

26   	Thus, the contents of the registration form - itself
admissible as a business record - could be proved by tendering the running
sheet as a summary or extract pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)(a)</a>, and also by adducing oral
evidence from Detective Senior Constable Trench pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)(b)</a>
utilising the running sheet to revive his memory of its contents.
