THE SUPREME COURT
<P>

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

15 March 1999
<P>

<u>11516/98   -   Jennifer Madden bhnf Joseph Madden v</u>
<P>

<u>New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	The plaintiff suffered personal injury in a motor vehicle accident.  Marsdens
were instructed to act on her behalf.  She brought
proceedings in the District
Court to recover damages.  Mr Wheelahan QC and Mr Maxwell were briefed to
appear on her behalf.  The
hearing took place before his Honour Judge Taylor.
The plaintiff recovered judgment in the sum of $1,392,980.74.  On 16 April
1996,
Taylor DCJ made orders for costs.  The defendant was ordered, inter alia,
to pay the costs of the plaintiff on an indemnity basis
for the period from 7
November 1994 to the date of judgment.
<P>

2	The order for indemnity costs was made pursuant to Part 19A rule 9 of the
<i>District Court Rules</i>.  The judgment sum awarded to the plaintiff
exceeded an earlier offer of compromise
<P>

3	A bill of costs was prepared.  It is dated 18 July 1996 and in the sum of
$395,680.54 (including professional costs in the total
sum of $187,585.64).
Proceedings were commenced for an assessment of the costs.  The application for
assessment was referred to a
Costs Assessor (Mr Cockle).  After receiving
submissions from the parties (including objection to part of the bill in the
total sum
of $169,832.74), he issued a Certificate As To Determination Of Costs
on 24 April 1998.  He assessed the costs in the sum of $260,925.18.
 His
assessment either disallowed or reduced certain items.  These are identified in
a Schedule to the Certificate.
<P>

4	The plaintiff seeks to challenge the disallowance and reduction of the items.
A Summons was filed on 19 June 1998.  By that time,
the prescribed period for
the bringing of proceedings had elapsed (it is said that it expired on 22 May
1998).  The plaintiff now
applies for an extension of time.  The application is
opposed.  An Amended Summons was filed on 6 October 1998.  Relief is apparently
sought pursuant to both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 208L</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">208M</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act,
1987</a> </i>(the <i>Act</i>).  By consent, the claim for relief under the
<i>Act</i> and the application for an extension of time were heard together.
<P>

5	The plaintiff had entered into a Conditional Fee Agreement which is dated 7
November 1994 (there may have also been individual
agreements made with
counsel).  It was placed before the Costs Assessor.  The Agreement enabled the
legal representatives to charge
the client a success fee (which is described in
the <i>Act</i> as a "premium") of up to 25% of the agreed fee in certain
circumstances (it was said to be in view of, inter alia, "the speculative
nature of the claim").  It also specified the fee rates to be charged by legal
representatives.  Such an agreement is permissible
by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s186.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 186</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s187.html" class="autolink_findacts">187</a> of the <i>Act</i>.  These are contained in Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> which
is headed "Costs agreements".  These provisions regulate costs arrangements
between legal representatives and their clients.
<P>

6	During the second reading speech of the <i>Legal Profession Reform Bill</i>
it was said that there may be a premium to take account of the risk involved
"but the fee must not vary according to the benefit
received by the client".
<P>

7	In this case, the legal representatives sought to charge a premium in the
maximum of 25%.  The charges appear as items in the
bill of costs.  The items
were disallowed by the Costs Assessor.  The total of the items was in the order
of about $35,000.  Further,
he either disallowed or reduced charges for
loadings, conferences and other disbursements.  The total of these charges is
relatively
modest.
<P>

8	It is common ground that the Costs Assessor was bound to have regard to any
relevant rules of the Court (section 208F).  For present
purposes, the relevant
rule is Part 39A rule 13 of the <i>District Court Rules</i>.  It is in the
following form:-
<P>

	On an assessment on the indemnity basis, all costs shall be allowed except in
so far as they are of an unreasonable amount or have
been unreasonably
incurred, and any doubts which the assessor may have as to whether the costs
were reasonably incurred or were reasonable
in amount shall be resolved in
favour of the receiving party.
<P>

9	The material before the Court may be found in Exhibit A.  This is largely the
material that was before the Costs Assessor.  There
are two affidavits sworn by
Elyse White (these are relevant to the question of default).  The plaintiff
sought to read an affidavit
sworn by Mr Coombs.  The defendant objected to the
reading of the affidavit.  It comprised material that had not been placed
before
the Costs Assessor.  I decided that this material should not be received
in the hearing of these proceedings.  I shall return to
that matter in due
course.
<P>

10	The question of the contingency fee was dealt with by the Costs Assessor as
a preliminary matter.  The decision was made during
November 1997.  The parties
were notified of the decision by letter dated 12 November 1997 (a copy of the
letter forms part of Exhibit
A).  The letter contains material which may be
said to express the reasoning process behind the decision.  The letter makes
specific
reference to a variety of matters and, inter alia, it both referred to
and set out rule 13.  It contains, inter alia, the following:-
<P>

	"I do not interpret this rule as imposing upon the Costs Assessor a duty to
assess party/party costs in accordance with each and
every agreement entered
into on a solicitor/client basis.'
<P>

	`Having considered the submissions of the parties and the matters to which I
have referred, I reach the conclusion that it would
be unreasonable for the
Respondent to incur the additional 25% costs agreed to between the Plaintiff
and solicitor pursuant to the
costs agreement.  I am not at liberty to apply
the terms of the costs agreement unless I am of the opinion that it is a cost
which
the Respondent might reasonably incur.
<P>

	For the above reasons, I am not prepared to assess party/party costs by
increasing the assessment by 25% mark up pursuant to the
contingency fee
agreement."
<P>

11	After having made that decision, the Assessor then proceeded to complete the
assessment process.  This was done when he issued
the Certificate in 1998.
<P>

12	Counsel for the plaintiff have handed up written submissions.  The principal
contention is that there has been error of law.
 It is said that the Costs
Assessor asked himself the wrong question and thereby assessed the costs on a
fair and reasonable basis
(rather than on an indemnity basis).  Further, it is
said that either he failed to give reasons or that the reasoning process
disclosed
was insufficient.  These arguments have been advanced by way of
general submission in respect of each item disallowed or reduced.
<P>

13	In my view, it is clear that the Costs Assessor directed his mind to the
provisions of rule 13.  This rule requires the Costs
Assessor to allow all
costs unless he is satisfied that they are of an unreasonable amount or have
been unreasonably incurred.
<P>

14	I consider that the determination is consistent with him both having had
regard to that rule and correctly applying its provisions.
 I am not satisfied
that this challenge is made out by the plaintiff.
<P>

15	The exercise of determining whether costs are unreasonable in the sense
contemplated by the rule is a factual one.  Each case
is going to turn on its
own particular facts.  In this case, it was clearly open to the Costs Assessor
to decide that costs (including
the contingency fees) were unreasonable in the
relevant sense.
<P>

16	Since the decision of <u>Attorney-General of NSW &amp; Anor v Kennedy Miller
Television Pty Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d8%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-8) 43 NSWLR 729</a>, there is binding authority that a
costs assessor should provide reasons.  The Court has been referred to
authorities containing
dicta concerning the matter of what will discharge an
obligation to give reasons (including <u>Kennedy Miller</u> and <u>Soulemezis v
Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247).</a>  It must be borne in mind
that the Court is dealing with a decision made by a costs assessor and not a
judicial officer.  Many of
the cases concern the discharge of the duty owed by
a judicial officer.  In the cases, observations have been made as to what is
required of a decision maker.  It has been said that lengthy or elaborate
reasons are not required; in most cases, a word or two
may suffice and it is
necessary that the essential ground upon which the decision rests should be
articulated.  Whilst there is a
plethora of dicta, it may be that ultimately
the question has to be dealt with on a case by case basis.
<P>

17	A costs assessor is bound to issue a certificate.  He is not required to
deliver a determination in the nature of a judgment.
 There is no prescribed
format for the disclosure of the reasoning process.  It has been done in
conjunction with the prescribed
form of the Certificate.  The Costs Assessor
may deal with it in correspondence.  In some instances, the reasoning process
may be
discernible from a combination of sources.
<P>

18	In this case, it may be said that the reasoning process could have been
articulated with greater polish and eloquence.  Be that
as it may, in my view
it emerges with sufficient clarity.  The thrust of what is conveyed is that, in
disallowing or reducing items,
the Costs Assessor has been satisfied that what
was either disallowed or reduced was unreasonable in the sense contemplated by
the
rule.  It seems to me that this is so when regard is had to correspondence
and other documentation (including submissions and objections)
as well as the
Certificate together with the attached Schedule.  For completeness, I should
mention, inter alia, one disallowed item
appears from the material to be mere
duplication.  Whilst this may not strictly fall within the compass of the
indemnity costs rule,
it could not be said that the disallowance of a
duplication was erroneous.
<P>

19	It may also be observed that there can be cases where, strictly speaking,
the duty has not been discharged yet the appellate
process is not effectively
negated.  The rationale behind the determination may sufficiently appear from
material that is available
to the parties and the Court (see <u>Bacha v
Patterson</u> (3 December 1998)).
<P>

20	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law which would
justify the disturbing of the determination.  Whilst
the plaintiff concentrated
on this challenge to the determination, the process does claim relief of the
nature provided by section
208M.  The impression was given that resort was had
to this provision largely for the purpose of using it as a vehicle for the
admissibility
of fresh evidence.  Under this provision, the Court may grant
leave to appeal.  This power is exercised having regard to the circumstances
of
the particular case before the Court and so that justice is best served between
the parties.  As in the case of section 208L,
the onus rests on the plaintiff
to demonstrate an entitlement to relief.  The defendant contends that this
Court does not have jurisdiction
to entertain the application for leave in this
case.  It is said that, by virtue of subsection (2), the District Court only
has the
jurisdiction.  There may well be considerable force in that argument.
However, the point was not fully argued and it is unnecessary
to further pursue
it.  On the assumption that this Court does have jurisdiction, I am not
satisfied that the plaintiff has demonstrated
any entitlement to the granting
of leave.
<P>

21	I should mention that the defendant has advanced a number of other
arguments.  For a variety of reasons (including questions
going to the validity
of such conditional costs agreements as were made), it says that it would be a
futile exercise to send the
matter back to the Costs Assessor for
re-determination.  The arguments relate to matters which were not agitated
before the Costs
Assessor.  It is said that they could be raised before him if
the matter was sent back to him for re-determination.  In the light
of the
views already expressed, it is not necessary to dwell on these arguments.
<P>

22	There is material handed up by the defendant which it says supports the view
that it was not contemplated that a contingency
fee would fall within what may
be regarded as indemnity costs.  It may lend support for the determination that
has been made by the
Costs Assessor.  It suggests that the Costs Assessor may
have taken a view that was popular with other Costs Assessors.  I mention
it
for completeness only, as it has not been taken into account in dealing with
the questions raised on this appeal.
<P>

23	As things presently stand, there is no competent appeal before the Court.
The plaintiff needs an extension of time.  I have explored
the merits of the
grounds of appeal.  In the light of the views expressed, it would be futile to
grant an extension of time.  I should
add that, when exercising the
jurisdiction to extend time, it is usually relevant to have regard to the
explanation offered for the
failure to bring the appeal within the prescribed
time.  In this case, the explanation offered falls short of what may be
regarded
as satisfactory.  In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that I
should grant an extension.
<P>

24	I should briefly return to the matter of the rejected affidavit.  Section
208L does not contemplate the receiving of fresh evidence
on the hearing of an
appeal (subsection (3) contemplates the receiving of, inter alia, fresh
evidence on a re-determination).  The
appeal is restricted to a matter of law
arising in the proceedings to determine the application.  Section 208M
contemplates that
fresh evidence may be received in the hearing of the appeal
itself.  In this case, even if the Court had jurisdiction, I am not satisfied
that the plaintiff is entitled to a granting of leave.  If the assumption be
made that the Court has jurisdiction to entertain an
application under section
208M, I am not satisfied that any grounds have been disclosed for receiving
fresh evidence.  In any event,
I am not satisfied that the fresh evidence has
relevance to the matters agitated in the proceedings.
<P>

25	Before concluding the judgment, it is necessary to refer to one further
matter.  After apparently completing the submissions
in reply, Counsel for the
plaintiff arose to raise a fresh ground of appeal.  It has not been expressly
raised in any documentation
and the defendant had no notice of it.  It relates
to a question involving a sum in the order of about $60,000.  The defendant was
not in a position to deal with the matter and it would not have been in the
interests of justice to proceed further with it at the
time.  I have reserved
to the plaintiff liberty to apply for an amendment of the Summons, should she
be so advised.  On this matter,
inter alia, the question of jurisdiction may be
of relevance.  I have advised the parties that I propose to proceed with the
determination
of the matters that have been argued before me.  Counsel do not
oppose the taking of this course.
<P>

26	Until the reserved question has been dealt with, I cannot make final orders
on the Summons.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs
of the Summons to date.
