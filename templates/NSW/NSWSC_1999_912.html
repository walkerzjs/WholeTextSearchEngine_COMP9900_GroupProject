JUDGMENT: 
<P>

THE SUPREME COURT
<P>

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

NEWCASTLE REGISTRY
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 10 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>N00132/1995</u>	<u>ELIZABETH ANNE BELLAMY v CLARENCE ROBERT BENNETT</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on
24 July 1995.  The plaintiff suffered personal injury in a motor
vehicle
accident (the particulars of the injuries include severe head injury and closed
diffuse axonal brain injury).  Her claim
is for damages.
<P>

2  	The proceedings have now been listed for call-over at Newcastle
on 17 September 1999.  It is thought that the plaintiff may
be seeking a
hearing at the call-over.
<P>

3  	The solicitors for the plaintiff had been Friend &amp; Hazard.
This firm served on the solicitors for the defendant a document
dated 24 July
1997 which has been described by a solicitor for the defendant as Draft <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Part 33</a>
Particulars.  For sometime thereafter the plaintiff had been represented by
Scott Sheils &amp; Glover.  The solicitor for the plaintiff
is now Peter R
Glover.
<P>

4  	By letter dated 28 January 1999 the solicitors for the defendant
sought the following from the plaintiff's then solicitors Scott
Sheils &amp;
Glover:-
<P>

"Kindly provide to us particulars of the plaintiff's pre and post-accident
treating doctors.
<P>

In respect of pre-accident treating doctors kindly provide to us the full names
and addresses of those doctors for the period of
five years prior to the date
of accident".
<P>

5  	In a subsequent letter dated 9 February 1999, the solicitors for
the defendant also sought the execution of an authority directed
to the Health
Insurance Commission.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff took the stance that she was not obliged to comply
with these requests and did not do so.
<P>

7  	On 15 April 1999, the defendant filed a Notice of Motion seeking
orders that the request be complied with.  The application
was heard by the
Acting Prothonotary on 24 May 1999.  He had before him two affidavits sworn by
Christine Barbara MacGregor (a solicitor
in the employ of the solicitors for
the defendant).  The Acting Prothonotary reserved his decision.  The decision
was delivered on
2 August 1999.  The Acting Prothonotary dismissed the Notice
of Motion and ordered that the defendant pay the costs of the motion.
<P>

8  	On 24 August 1999, the defendant filed a further Notice of
Motion.  Its seeks relief pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p61" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 61</a> r 3 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Rules</u> 1970</a>.  This provision enables a review to be had of a decision of a
Registrar.
<P>

9  	The decision was reviewed on 7 September 1999.  For the purposes
of the review the court had placed before it the material that
had been
tendered on the application heard by the Acting Prothonotary.
<P>

10  	The authorities establish that on a review the aggrieved party
should provide some proper basis (which may be inter alia something
found to be
wrong or lacking) for disturbing the decision under challenge (see inter alia
<u>Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd v Atamian</u> (Court of Appeal, unreported, 18
June 1996)).  For purposes of additional clarity, I stress that this does not
mean that some error
of principle or otherwise needs to be demonstrated.
<P>

11  	After conducting the review, I reached the conclusion that no
proper basis had been demonstrated by the defendant for the disturbing
of the
decision of the Acting Prothonotary.
<P>

12  	During the review, the defendant abandoned the claim for relief
in relation to the execution of the authority.  The only relief
sought was an
order that the plaintiff provide the full names and addresses of her
pre-accident treating doctors for the period of
five years prior to the date of
the accident.
<P>

13  	The defendant presents this application as a party seeking an
order for further and better particulars of the plaintiff's claim.
 Although
there was some brief mention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p26" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 26</a> r 1, (and it is unclear whether this
matter was agitated before the Acting Prothonotary), the thrust of the case was
that the defendant
was entitled to an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p16" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 16</a> r 7.
<P>

14  	The rules distinguish between pleadings (Pt 15) and particulars
(Pt 16).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p16" class="autolink_findacts">Part 16</a> r 1 imposes a general obligation to give the necessary
particulars of any matter pleaded.  There are other rules which identify
particulars
which are to be given in specified instances.  Rule 7 confers a
discretionary power to order a party to file and serve certain particulars
(of
any matter stated in the party's pleading or in any affidavit ordered to stand
as a pleading (sub-rule (1)(a)) and relating to
general or other damages
claimed by the party (sub-rule (1) (c)).  The discretion to make an order can
only be exercised in those
cases where what is sought as particulars falls
within the ambit of sub-rules (1) (a) and (1) (c).
<P>

15  	When the requirements of sub-rules (1) (a) and (1) (c) have been
met, the court will look to the discretionary considerations
agitated by the
parties.  The court is not disposed to make orders which lack utility (such as
where the particulars sought are not
necessary).
<P>

16  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Part 33</a> r 8A applies to proceedings in this Division in which a
claim is made for damages in respect of personal injuries.  Sub-rule (2)
prevents the filing of a notice to set down for trial in such proceedings
unless the plaintiff has served a statement setting out
certain prescribed
information (including particulars) and providing certain documents.  The
subject matter of the present dispute
does not fall within the ambit of the
material contemplated by such a statement.
<P>

17  	The defendant has taken an aggressive stance in relation to the
matter of compliance with its request.  The case was forcefully
argued during
the review.  The bringing of an appeal was intimated.
<P>

18  	It was submitted that the defendant was in substance seeking an
order for particulars of the plaintiff's claim.  In my view
that contention is
untenable.  In the course of argument, it was also said that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 33</a> particulars
form part of the pleadings in a personal injury case.  In my view, that
contention is also untenable.  For completeness,
it should be stressed that
what is sought in this case is not further particulars of something alleged in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 33</a> particulars.
<P>

19  	It is abundantly clear that the defendant is not in fact seeking
an order for particulars of any matter pleaded in the Statement
of Claim or for
particulars of any claim for damages made by the plaintiff.  It is in substance
an application for an order that
the plaintiff provide information (the names
and addresses of doctors who treated her during the five years prior to the
date of
the accident) which it is hoped may throw up something of use in the
defending of her claim.  It is largely in the nature of a fishing
expedition.
The function of particulars is well established by authority.  The defendant's
request falls well outside the scope of
that function.  It may be added that
the request was not even limited to matters in issue (such as treatment
relevant to the injuries
particularised in the Statement of Claim).
<P>

20  	I do not consider that the defendant has made out a case for
relief under either <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p16" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 16</a> r 7 or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p26" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 26</a> r 1.  In my view, the review has not
provided any proper basis for disturbing the decision of the Acting
Prothonotary.
<P>

21  	I order that the Notice of Motion filed on 24 August 1999 be
dismissed.  The defendant is to pay the costs of the Notice of
Motion.
