<u>12279 of 1991  ANNE MARIE ROLFE v ANTHONY JOHN EDBROOKE &amp; ORS.</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 2 May 1991
(shortly before the relevant limitation period expired).
 The process propounds
a claim for damages founded on negligence against two defendants.  It is
alleged that the injury was suffered
on or about 4 May 1985 when the plaintiff
was performing nursing duties and lifted the late Doris Mary Blanchard (the
deceased).
 The first defendants were partners in a business conducted under
the name "Gordon Trained Nurses Club".  The deceased died on 4
April 1988.  The
purported second defendant is named as "The Estate of Doris Mary Blanchard (by
the Legal Personal Representative)."
<P>

2	It appears that the first defendants ran a nursing employment agency for
about 9 years.  They had a number of nurses on their
books (in the range of 50
to 100 nurses).  Nurses were placed inter alia in public hospital and private
situations.  A remuneration
in the nature of a fee was received for these
services.
<P>

3	The plaintiff was in doubt as to which of the first defendants or the
deceased was her employer at the time of injury.  This doubt
is reflected in
the plaintiff's pleadings.
<P>

4	On 4 December 1987, the plaintiff brought proceedings in the Compensation
Court against the deceased.  In July 1988, the first
defendants were added as
parties to those proceedings.  It was in contemplation that those proceedings
would resolve the question
of employment.  Subsequent to the death of the
deceased, the plaintiff's legal advisers appear to have proceeded on the basis
that
Robert Blanchard and William Blanchard were the deceased's' legal personal
representatives (there is no evidence placed before this
Court of a grant of
probate or letters of administration).  They became parties in the Compensation
Court proceedings.
<P>

5	The Compensation Court proceedings had a long history.  There was a hearing
before Judge Gibson.  His Honour died before delivering
his reserved decision.
The proceedings then came before Judge Burke.  He delivered his decision on 4
February 1993.  On 4 March 1993,
an appeal was brought from that decision.  On
29 August 1995, the Court of Appeal delivered its decision.  As the appeal was
successful,
the proceedings were sent back to the Compensation Court and came
before Judge Duck.  His Honour delivered his decision on 22 December
1997.  The
finding was made that the second defendant was the employer of the plaintiff at
the time of injury.  On 30 January 1998,
the second defendant brought an appeal
from the decision.  The first defendant did not receive notice of the appeal
until 9 February
1998.  The appeal was discontinued on 31 August 1998.
<P>

6	A number of solicitors have acted for the plaintiff.  These proceedings were
commenced on her behalf by Vandervords.  Later, Andrew
Fegent became her
solicitor.  Keddies now act for her.
<P>

7	In July 1993, Andrew Fegent sent a copy of the Statement of Claim together
with Notice of Change of Solicitor to both Curwood
&amp; Partners (who had the
conduct of the Compensation Court proceedings on behalf of the deceased), and
Connery &amp; Partners
( who had the conduct of the proceedings on behalf of
the first defendants).  Further correspondence passed between the solicitors.
It was arranged that no further action would be taken adverse to the interests
of the defendants until the Compensation Court proceedings
had been dealt with
by the Court of Appeal (in the absence of adequate notice).  In the course of
this correspondence, Curwood &amp;
Partners had informed Andrew Fegent that
inter alia "We do not believe that any person liable to be sued has been named
in the document
in any event".  It is common ground that in July 1993 the
process was stale and that the forwarding of the copy Statement of Claim
did
not constitute service of the process.
<P>

8	In late January 1998, Mrs Edbrooke (one of the first defendants) received
some erroneous advice from her solicitor.  It led her
to believe that the
litigation brought by the plaintiff was then at an end.  This led her to
destroy about 8 or 9 fruit boxes of
documents.  These were documents that were
associated with the proceedings in the Compensation Court.  It seems to be the
case that
the business activities of the first defendants had ceased some years
prior to that time.  The plaintiff had first come onto their
books in about
1980.
<P>

9	The plaintiff did not purport to serve the Statement of Claim on the first
defendants until about November 1998.  Robert Blanchard
was not served with it
until 16 December 1998.  William Blanchard was not served with it until 24
December 1998.
<P>

10	There are three Notices of Motion before the Court.  The first was filed by
the first defendants on 2 December 1998.  It seeks
an order that the
proceedings be set aside.  The second Notice of Motion was filed by the
plaintiff on 19 January 1999.  It seeks
inter alia validation of service of the
process.  The third Notice of Motion was filed by the second defendants on 15
February 1999.
 It seeks relief similar to that sought by the first
defendants.
<P>

11	At the time of purported service, the process was indisputably stale and not
valid for service.  It had ceased to be valid under
the Supreme Court Rules
many years earlier (see Part 7 rule 7).  The rule in its present form makes the
process valid for 1 year
from the date on which it is filed (previously it had
been valid for a 2 year period), unless the Court otherwise orders.  If it
is
served outside the period of its validity, there is authority to say that the
service should be regarded as an irregularity.
<P>

12	The parties look to s 81 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> for relief.  It is in
the following terms:-
<P>

	"81 (1)  Where, in  beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any
stage in the course of or in connection with any
proceedings, there is, by
reason of anything done or left undone, a failure to comply with the
requirements of this Act or of the
rules whether in respect of time, place,
manner, form or content or in any other respect--
<P>

	(a)  the failure shall be treated as an irregularity
<P>

	and shall not nullify the proceedings, or any step taken in the proceedings,
or any document, judgment or order in the proceedings;
 and
<P>

	(b)  subject to the subsections (2) and (3), the
<P>

	Court may, on terms, set aside wholly or in part the proceedings or any step
taken in the proceedings or any document, judgment
or order in the proceedings
or exercise its powers under this Act and the rules to allow amendments and to
make orders dealing with
the proceedings generally."
<P>

The Court is prohibited from exercising the discretionary power conferred by
(b) where the application is not made within a reasonable
time and the
applicant has taken a fresh step after becoming aware of the irregularity
(sub-section (3)).  The plaintiff does not
rely on the prohibition.  I should
add that section 81 contemplates that the application is to be made by a party.
The terms of the
section make it applicable where there has been a failure to
comply with the requirements of the Act or of the rules.
<P>

13	The rules confer other powers on the Court to order dismissal of the process
(inter alia where there is an entitlement to summary
relief and/or there has
been a want of prosecution).
<P>

14	The plaintiff relies on a affidavit sworn by her solicitor (Mr Barakat).
The first defendants rely on an affidavit sworn by Mrs
Edbrooke.  The purported
second defendant relies on an affidavit sworn by Mr Hensley.  The first
defendants also tendered Exhibit
1.
<P>

15	The plaintiff's Notice of Motion was misconceived and otiose.  As I have
said, when the section has application the authorities
regard purported service
as an irregularity.  During the course of argument, mention was made of seeking
relief by way of confirmation
of service.  No source of power was identified to
enable this relief to be granted in the circumstances of this case <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Part 9</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule
11</a> enables confirmation of informal service where service is impractical).
When the section has application, the affected parties are
placed in a position
where they are obliged to move promptly for relief.
<P>

16	It is convenient to first look at the position of the purported second
defendant.  Mr Parker of counsel appeared in that interest.
 It was no secret
that his real instructions came from an insurer.  The difficulty for the
plaintiff is that the Statement of Claim
does not name any legal entity as the
second defendant.  The plaintiff's legal advisers had been put on notice of
this problem as
early as 1993.  Despite having the benefit of that notice,
nothing was done to rectify the problem in these proceedings.  Counsel
for the
plaintiff was given many opportunities to make submissions on how this problem
could be overcome.  He was unable to provide
an answer.  The Court was left
with a situation where there has been an abortive attempt to serve this process
on two persons who
were not parties to the proceedings and there was an insurer
purporting to appear for them and have the process set aside.  The end
result
is that the purported service is of no effect and the insurer lacks status to
have the proceedings set aside or dismissed.
It was not a situation in which
section 81 could come to the aid of the plaintiff.
<P>

17	I now turn to the application made by the first defendants (it should be
noted that the submissions made on their behalf were
largely adopted by the
purported second defendant).  It is common ground that certain estoppels arise
from the compensation proceedings
(inter alia the plaintiff is estopped from
asserting that the first defendants were her employers at the time of the
injury).  It
seems to be clear that the real case now sought to be advanced by
the plaintiff for damages was against the insurer of the purported
second
defendant.  The first defendants are uninsured and it is said that they do not
have assets to meet any judgment that may be
recovered against them.  I gained
the impression that the plaintiff was now merely seeking to retain the first
defendants as parties
to the proceedings as a precautionary measure.  At best,
the thinnest of cases only can be advanced against the first defendants.
 It
was put in terms that there had been a breach of duty by the first defendants
in failing to advise the plaintiff that she should
have used a lifting device
in the course of her employment with others.  This allegation really has in
contemplation the concept
of the first defendants (who were conducting an
employment agency) having a duty to interfere in the conduct of work performed
pursuant
to contractual relations made between the plaintiff and the employer.
I bear in mind that the law of negligence is not static and
that a claim
founded on negligence can often be difficult to categorise as hopeless.  The
claim in this case has been described as
being highly speculative.  In my view,
putting the case at its highest, its prospects of success are extremely
limited.
<P>

18	The injury was suffered about 14 years ago.  The relevant contractual
relationships between plaintiff and first defendants came
into being about 19
years ago.  There is no relevant writing.  The contractual arrangements
(together with other relevant matters)
will have to be discerned inter alia
from conversations which took place many years ago.
<P>

19	Memories will have faded.  There is a loss of documentation.  Some of it may
have relevance to the issues which may be agitated
at a trial.  Whilst the
catalyst for the destruction of documents was the erroneous advice given by the
solicitor for the first defendants,
the delay in the advancing of these
proceedings by the plaintiff has also played a part.  There is medical evidence
to support the
view that the many years of litigation have been the stressor
for anxiety and depression suffered by Mrs Edbrooke.  There was a relapse
in
December 1998.  She has been diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive
disorder and from a generalised anxiety disorder which
is related to the
litigation.  The prognosis for recovery is dependent upon the removal of the
stress of litigation.  It would be
cruel to her if she has to continue with the
position of these proceedings hanging over her head for years to come.  Apart
from actual
prejudice, there is the presumptive prejudice that flows from the
enormous delay in this case.
<P>

20	There were other matters agitated.  It is not necessary to pursue all of
them.  Perhaps I should mention two of them.  One relates
to the matter of
bringing Cross-claims.  The relevant limitation period for the bringing of
Cross-claims between parties in the positions
of the first and second
defendants has expired.  The other relates to the question of alternative
rights (such as against legal advisers).
 The plaintiff may have such rights.
If that be so, the authorities say that it is not a matter to be given great
weight.
<P>

21	There is a real lack of utility in allowing the plaintiff to proceed with
her claim against the first defendants.  The first
defendants bear the onus of
the satisfying the Court that the process should be set aside.  I take the view
that this lack of utility
of itself is probably a decisive factor.  However,
when regard is had to all of the other relevant circumstance as well, that view
is strongly reinforced.  Accordingly, in the relevant circumstances of this
case, I am satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

22	I order that the proceedings brought by the plaintiff against the first
defendants be set aside and dismissed.  The plaintiff
is to pay the costs of
the Notice of Motion brought by the first defendants.  I dismiss the Notice of
Motion brought in the interests
of the purported second defendant.  I reserve
the question of costs of that Notice of Motion.  I dismiss the Notice of Motion
filed
by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of that Notice of
Motion.  The Exhibit may be returned.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-22 are the reasons for judgment of Master
Malpass.
