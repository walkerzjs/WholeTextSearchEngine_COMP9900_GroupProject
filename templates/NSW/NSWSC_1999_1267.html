<P>

98/004		<b>REGINA   v   KEITH REGINALD MARSHALL</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:    This is an application pursuant to s 13A of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> for the determination of a minimum term and an additional
term.
<P>

2  	In June 1989 the applicant, Keith Reginald Marshall, stood trial
charged with the murder of a thirty-eight year old man, Richard
Stanley
Burridge.  The jury found him guilty of that offence and on 14 July 1989 I
sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for
life.  It was necessary, of
course, as s 19 of the <i>Crimes Act</i> then provided, that such sentence be
imposed unless it appeared that the applicant's culpability for the crime was
significantly
diminished by mitigating circumstances.  I did not find the
applicant's culpability to be significantly diminished.  Before sentencing
the
applicant I had regard to evidence that the prisoner had been drinking
intoxicating liquor prior to the commission of the offence
but in my remarks on
sentence I stated:
<P>

<i>"The evidence does not establish on the probabilities therefore that the
prisoner was affected by intoxicating liquor at the time
that this murder was
committed.  The evidence does not establish on the probabilities any
circumstance whereby the prisoner's culpability
for the crime of which the jury
has found him guilty was significantly diminished.  No mitigating circumstances
having been established,
I have no alternative but to sentence the prisoner to
penal servitude for life."</i>
<P>

3  	The applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against
his conviction but that appeal was dismissed.
<P>

4  	It is now over ten years since the applicant was sentenced, so
there is no barrier to this application by reason of s 13A(3)
of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.
<P>

5  	Under s 13A(4A) I am required, in considering the application:
<P>

<i>"to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which
the life sentence was imposed, and all offences wherever
committed, of which
[the applicant] has been convicted at any time..."</i>
<P>

<b>The circumstances surrounding the offence</b>
<P>

6  	Pursuant to Practice Note 57 a statement of the facts of the case
was filed and served upon the applicant disclosing the following
circumstances:
<P>

<i>"(i)	Background to events of Friday, 13 May, 1988</i>
<P>

<i>9.	At the relevant time the applicant resided at 2/256 Stanmore Road
Stanmore with a flat mate Helen Miles.  Also temporarily resident
with them was
the step sister of Ms Miles.</i>
<P>

<i>10.	The victim Rick Burridge resided with his de facto Glenda Browne
(`Silky') at Unit 1 18 Middleton St. Petersham.</i>
<P>

<i>11.	The persons named in the two preceding paragraphs were all well
acquainted with each other.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	Events of 13 May, 1988</i>
<P>

<i>12.	At about midday on 13 May, 1988 the applicant visited the Petersham unit
where the victim, Ms Miles and Ms Browne were present.</i>
<P>

<i>13.	After a conversation in the unit the applicant and Mr Burridge went
outside and were observed by a nearby resident to be involved
in a scuffle in
the street.  The applicant was seen to be jabbing at Burridge with a
knife.</i>
<P>

<i>14.	When they returned to the unit on this occasion Ms Miles saw that the
applicant had two knives in his pocket and both men were
observed to have blood
on their hands.  The applicant left the unit early in the afternoon and
subsequently returned to his Stanmore
flat where he was visited by a man named
Riley.</i>
<P>

<i>15.	Meanwhile at the Petersham Unit Burridge and the two females continued
drinking alcohol as they had been doing earlier in the
day.</i>
<P>

<i>16.	In the late afternoon the applicant demonstrated to his visitor Riley
his skill with knives before both men left the flat shortly
before 7.00 pm en
route to the Petersham unit.</i>
<P>

<i>17.	The applicant forced his way into the unit after smashing at least one
of the glass panes on the front door and once inside was
confronted by Rick
Burridge.</i>
<P>

<i>18.	The applicant demanded that Helen Miles come back to his place and was
told by Burridge to `piss off and leave her (Helen Miles)
alone'.</i>
<P>

<i>19.	A struggle then took place between the two men during which the
applicant inflicted at least seven knife wounds to the body of
the victim
before leaving the scene.  He visited at least one hotel where he consumed
alcohol before returning to his Stanmore flat.</i>
<P>

<i>20.	Police and ambulance officers who arrived at the scene at about 7.30 pm
observed the victim lying on his back in the front bedroom
of the unit with his
legs in the hallway.</i>
<P>

<i>21.	He ceased breathing shortly thereafter and attempts to revive him by
police and paramedics at the scene and on the way to Royal
Prince Alfred
Hospital failed as did further resuscitation attempts at the Hospital.</i>
<P>

<i>22.	At 2.00 am on 14 May, 1988 Detectives went to the applicant's Stanmore
flat and were eventually allowed into the flat after he
had initially prevented
them from gaining entry.</i>
<P>

<i>23.	After informing the applicant that he was under arrest for inflicting
the fatal wounds on Burridge Detective Halpin asked him
the location of the
knives he had used and received the response `Silky's got them'.</i>
<P>

<i>24.	Detective Bramann then showed him two knives which he had found in the
flat which appeared to be bloodstained and asked him whether
they were the
knives he had used.  The applicant's response was `I haven't seen those for
months'.</i>
<P>

<i>25.	He was then transported to Petersham Police Station where he consented
to a blood sample being taken.</i>
<P>

<i>26.	Commencing at 4.55 am and concluding at 7.20 am the applicant took part
in a six page signed Record of Interview in which he denied
stabbing Rick
(Burridge) and claimed that he had seen `Silky' (Glenda Browne) stab him
apparently accidentally, while he and Burridge
were scuffling with each
other...</i>
<P>

<i>27.	At a post mortem examination of the deceased carried out by her early in
the morning of 14 May, 1988 Dr Sylvia Hollinger observed
seven stab wounds to
the body of the victim located as follows:  (1) &amp; (2) right side of upper
chest (3) &amp; (4) to the right
groin one of which wounds was wide and gaping
and had entered the inferior vena cava; (the large vein which enters the right
atrium)
causing extensive internal bleeding, (5) &amp; (6) to middle of abdomen
and (7) to the left groin.  The Doctor certified the cause
of death to be
multiple stab wounds.</i>
<P>

<i>28.	There was evidence at trial about the blood alcohol level of the
applicant and the deceased to the effect that the respective
levels were .06
and .210.  It should be borne in mind that the applicant's blood was obtained
some nine hours after the offence and
he consumed alcohol at a hotel(s) after
leaving the murder scene.</i>
<P>

<i>29.	There was also evidence in the Crown case at trial from a Mark Madigan,
who shared a cell with the applicant, to the effect that
after first stating it
was `Silky' who had stabbed Burridge, the applicant admitted a couple of days
later that he had done the stabbing
as he was `going to fix Ricky for good'.
He added that he was trying to `pin it on Silky'.</i>
<P>

<i>30.	In his case at trial the applicant made a statement to the jury which
was substantially in accord with his record of interview
to police and included
the claim that he had not stabbed the victim but Silky apparently had when she
lunged at them while they were
scuffling."</i>
<P>

7  	As required under Practice Note 57 the applicant responded to the
service of the statement of facts, indicating he accepted
such statement save
as to the following:
<P>

<i>"(i)	The `scuffle' referred to paragraph 13 did not occur on the street but
in the front yard of the premises.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	The applicant denies demonstrating his skill with knives to Riley as
alleged in paragraph 16.</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	The applicant denies that he forced his way into the unit as alleged
in paragraph 17.</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	The applicant denies he prevented or attempted to prevent the
Detectives from gaining entry to the flat as alleged in paragraph
22.</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	The applicant denied he `claimed that he has seen Silky (Glenda Browne)
stab him apparently accidentally' in the Record of Interview
referred to in
paragraph 26."</i>
<P>

8  	For present purposes I do not consider anything turns on the
matters disputed by the applicant in the above paragraphs (i) to
(iv).  As to
(v), the following questions and answers are recorded in the record of
interview which police conducted with the applicant
on 14 May 1988:
<P>

<i>"Q29.	What happened when you went back to the unit about teatime last
night?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I said Are you there Helen and Rick came out with an iron bar and told me
Helen's not going home she's staying here and told me
to piss off.  And then
started to swing the bar.  It struck me on the hand and the head.  Silky came
running down the hall brandishing
a knife I tried to avoid the knife and in the
scuffle Silky must have stabbed him instead of me.</i>
<P>

<i>Q30.	Did you actually see Silky stab Rick with a knife?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q31.	What did this knife look like?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was a kitchen handle knife.  Not as long as that bone handled one you
showed me, about ten inches long.</i>
<P>

<i>Q32.	How many times did you see Silky stab Rick?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Once.</i>
<P>

<i>Q33.	Where on Rick's body did Silky stab him?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I seen her lunge with the knife, I don't know if it actually
penetrated."</i>
<P>

9  	I observe that each page of the record of interview, including
the page upon which the above questions and answers are recorded,
was signed by
the applicant and I accept that the applicant made the responses attributed to
him by the answers to the above questions.
<P>

10  	I have regard to the circumstances surrounding the offence as
outlined in the above statement of facts, save for the matters
not accepted by
the applicant as above identified.  I do, however, have regard to the record of
interview and the questions and answers
thereof above set out.  Plainly the
applicant sought to convey to the police that it was "Silky" who wielded the
knife.
<P>

<b>The applicant's convictions</b>
<P>

11  	The applicant was born on 13 March 1938 so that he is now
sixty-one years of age.  He has been in custody continuously since
his arrest
on the relevant murder charge on 14 May 1988.  He has a formidable criminal
record beginning at the age of nineteen. 
In all there are forty convictions
recorded against the applicant; they include many offences for dishonesty,
convictions for robbery,
assault with intent to rob, assault, assault police,
and I note that in July 1979 the applicant was sentenced to five years penal
servitude in the Central Criminal Court for two offences of maliciously
inflicting grievous bodily harm.  The statement of facts
presented to the
sentencing judge in 1979 was tendered on this application.  That statement
discloses that the applicant used a knife
to stab two victims on 26 December
1978.  Fortunately they survived, but it is disturbing that the applicant did
not learn from his
earlier experience not to use a knife as a weapon again.
<P>

12  	The applicant has many convictions for offences under the
<i>Motor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/" class="autolink_findacts">Traffic Act</a></i>.  In all, the applicant's criminal record is a bad
one, and it reflects a problem with alcohol abuse.
<P>

<b>Report of the Serious Offenders' Review Council</b>
<P>

13  	I have had the advantage of considering a report from the
Serious Offenders' Review Council.  This gives some picture as to
the
applicant's progress whilst he has been in prison.  He has thus far served his
sentence in a number of institutions that include
Parklea, Lithgow and Long
Bay.  In December 1997 he was placed at the Industrial Training Centre at Long
Bay where he enjoys now
a C1 classification.  His progress in prison appears to
have been reasonable but I do note references that he does not seem to have
acknowledged his problem with alcohol and I do note further that in 1993 he was
asserting his innocence of the murder and was blaming
his wife for it.
<P>

14  	In March 1998 an assessment committee reviewed the applicant at
the Industrial Training Centre and reported:
<P>

<i>"His work and conduct reports were, as usual, good.  His damaged musical
instruments had been repaired and he was again teaching music.
 [The applicant
apparently has skill as a musician but his instruments had been damaged by
other inmates.]  He was still however
refusing to have contact with drug and
alcohol and psychological services.  The committee stressed the importance of
his contacting
the services for assessment and if necessary
counselling."</i>
<P>

15  	The Serious Offenders' Review Council concluded its report dated
13 October 1998 as follows:
<P>

<i>"In the event that the Supreme Court grants Marshall's application for the
re-determination of his sentence, then the Serious Offenders
Review Council
will develop a plan for his management during the remainder of any minimum term
imposed. Subject to satisfactory behaviour,
conduct and attitude, Marshall will
be progressively reduced in security classification leading, hopefully, to his
inclusion in unescorted,
external, pre-release leave, such as Day Leave and
Work Release programs, in preparation for his eventual return into the
community."</i>
<P>

16  	A supplementary communication from the Serious Offenders' Review
Council dated 26 October 1999 contained more recent information
as to the
applicant.  The case officer's assessment of 26 November 1998 is in these
terms:
<P>

<i>"Inmate Marshall cooperates very well and is not a problem Inmate.  He is
well groomed and looks healthy.  He seems to be a Jack of
all Trades and
participates in many activities, mainly the Gaol Music Band.  He keeps contact
to his family through phone calls and
gets visits."</i>
<P>

17  	The supplementary material was generally favourable, although
again I note an entry as late as 3 December 1998 when the applicant
was
maintaining his innocence in respect of the murder.
<P>

18  	The applicant's conduct overall in the prison system in the
period of some eleven years seven months that he has been in custody
for this
crime has been good.  Mr Webb, who appeared on the applicant's behalf,
submitted that the applicant has made a useful contribution
in prison life.  He
has learned the skill of hairdressing, having recently been issued with a
licence, he has utilised his skills
as a musician and has contributed to prison
concerts and he has, according to references tendered, worked well in various
other prison
activities.
<P>

19  	Mr Taylor, psychologist, assessed the applicant in April 1999.
The two features I mentioned earlier appearing from his prison
history are
reflected again in the psychologist's report.  The first of these is the
applicant's denial that he has had an alcohol
problem.  The second of these
features is that when he saw Mr Taylor he was still denying that he had killed
the deceased and he
was still asserting that the guilty party was his de facto
wife.  In blaming his wife I observe he appears to have shifted blame
away from
the woman referred to in his record of interview as "Silky".
<P>

20  	Mr Taylor commented upon the failure of the applicant to accept
responsibility for his crime, and expressed an opinion as to
the risk of the
applicant re-offending if released:
<P>

<i>"Mr Marshall was able to discuss his plans for the future, should he be
released.  He stated that he still has contact with his sister
and stated that
he would be able to live with her.  He is also still very much involved in his
music and feels that he would have
the opportunity to play professionally if he
is released.</i>
<P>

<i>Actuarial assessment of his potential to reoffend was assessed at being in
the average range.  This assessment however does not take
into account his
present age or aspects of his behaviour over the last ten years in gaol.  When
these are taken into account it seems
very likely that his potential to
reoffend would be lower than the assessment provided by the Statistical
Information on Recidivism
Scale.</i>
<P>

<i>By way of conclusion then I was unable to find any indication from the
information available to me to suggest that Mr Marshall would
reoffend in the
future.  The aspect of his stated alcoholism is a matter which could properly
be monitored as could other aspects
of his functioning."</i>
<P>

21  	The evidence indicates that the applicant has not yet faced up
to the fact that he murdered the deceased.  There are the various
records that
refer to this, and there is the report of Mr Taylor.  When last he gave
evidence before me following his conviction
and before sentence in 1989 he did
not acknowledge his guilt, and he claimed that it was Silky who had the knife.
On the present
application he has given no evidence.
<P>

22  	The lack of contrition is a relevant matter for me to consider
on this present application, impacting as it does upon the applicant's
rehabilitation:  see <i>R v White</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 23 June 1998) and
<i>R v Stephens</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 80.</a>  It is also relevant that the applicant,
notwithstanding his obvious alcohol problem in the past, has not freely
acknowledged the
problem and submitted adequately to counselling for it.
<P>

23  	In considering this application I have regard to all the various
matters addressed in s 13A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.
<P>

24  	It has not been contended by the Director of Public Prosecutions
that it would be inappropriate to grant this application.
 Indeed, the
application of the applicant is not opposed, and after reflection I have come
to the conclusion that I should accede
to the application.  During the
remainder of the minimum term which I intend to fix, in the interests of the
applicant's rehabilitation,
he should undertake further counselling for alcohol
abuse and attention should be directed to what appears to be a failure on his
part to accept his guilt.  Doubtless the applicant's progress in these areas
will be assessed when he is being considered for parole
in due course.
<P>

25  	The objective features of this crime I regard as very serious.
There were a number of knife wounds as disclosed in the post
mortem findings I
recorded earlier.  The conclusion is inescapable that the applicant must have
inflicted those wounds at the very
least with an intention to cause serious
bodily injury and the jury's verdict demonstrates that the jury so found.  The
Court of
Criminal Appeal has repeatedly stressed the abhorrence with which the
use of a knife as a weapon is regarded:  see, for example,
<i>Rothapfel</i>
(unreported, NSWCCA, 4 August 1992).
<P>

26  	I have regard to Mr Taylor's opinion concerning the risk of the
applicant re-offending.  I have regard to sentences imposed
by this court in
other crimes of murder, whilst recognising that each case depends very largely
upon its own particular facts.
<P>

27  	I have concluded that the appropriate sentence in this case is
one of nineteen years penal servitude and I now fix a minimum
term of thirteen
years six months and an additional term of five years six months.  The sentence
is to be backdated to 14 May 1988
since which date the applicant has been
continuously in custody for this crime.  The minimum term will thus expire on
13 November
2001.  The additional term of five years six months will commence
on 14 November 2001 and expire on 13 May 2007.  I specify 14 November
2001 as
the first date upon which the applicant is to be eligible for release on
parole.
