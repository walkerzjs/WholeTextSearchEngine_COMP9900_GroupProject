<P>

<b>Friday, 19 March 1999</b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1	These are my reasons for admitting a number of items identified as PXVD1
through 4, on the terms set out.  These items were first
admitted on the voir
dire for the purpose of argument as to admissibility,.  They are sufficiently
identified in the transcript.
 They, and Annexure A referred to below, are
advanced by the Plaintiffs to quantify the claimed damage, insofar as that
damage is
determined by reference to sponsorship payments from Telstra
Corporation Ltd ("Telstra") in relation to the Defendant.
<P>

2	Annexure A to an affidavit of Mr Bryce dated 16 March 1999 consists of what
purports to be a schedule of payments, prepared by
Telstra in response to the
Plaintiffs' subpoenas. It is sought to be adduced as recording Telstra's
sponsorship payments, in relation
to the Defendant. The principal issue is
whether Annexure A is admissible either as a business record <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s69</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>") assisted by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)(d)</a> and (e)) or under
general discretion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s190</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>). The Defendant contends that it should be
excluded as hearsay falling outside the exception for business records, on the
basis that
it was prepared for the purpose of the present proceeding; see
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. This is on the basis that the affidavit was furnished in
response to the Plaintiffs' subpoenas identified in paragraph 6 of that
affidavit; those subpoenas have now been produced and are contained in
PXVD2.
<P>

<b>FACTUAL AND FORENSIC CONTEXT</b>
<P>

3	The Plaintiffs seek to read both the affidavit of 16 March 1999 and an
earlier affidavit of Mr Bryce dated 21 September 1998,
though the latter
affidavit bears primarily on documentation recording certain payments made by
Telstra for the period between 1
January 1995 to 30 June 1996.  For present
purposes, I can simply note that those latter payments are separately to be
proven by
the Plaintiffs in a manner which they have yet to indicate in any
detail and are not the subject of my present ruling.
<P>

4	Annexure A to the affidavit of Mr Bryce of 16 March 1999, as I have said,
purports to set out details of payments made in connection
with the sponsorship
undertaken by Telstra after 1 July 1996, as recorded in the relevant accounting
system described in paragraph
7 of that affidavit following the methodology
elaborated in paragraphs 8 and 9.
<P>

5	I should note at this point that Mr Bryce gave oral evidence and submitted
himself for cross-examination, and I will refer, where
relevant, to that
evidence.
<P>

6	The material in Annexure A is described in paragraph 9 of Mr Bryce's
affidavit of 16 March 1999 as essentially the capture of
earlier computer
recorded data incorporated into reports produced in response to the relevant
subpoenas but after making two categories
of alteration to the data. The first
is described as a formatting alteration, and the second an alteration which
seeks to remove
certain accrual reverse entries.
<P>

7	I should note as to the latter, that the Plaintiffs do not seek to have
admitted into evidence the totals (and sub-totals) that
appear in Annexure A,
correctly recognising that the deletion of the "accrual reversal entries" could
affect such totals.
<P>

8	The admissibility of Annexure A is opposed by the Defendant on a number of
grounds.  Insofar as the material in Annexure A is
objected to on the ground of
relevance, I am satisfied that such objection could not be sustained.
<P>

9	Clearly enough the evidence in Annexure A could rationally affect the
assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact
in issue in the
present proceeding. That fact in issue is whether payments were made in
connection with a sponsorship of a kind which
would give rise to commission
payable to the Plaintiffs, were the Plaintiffs successful in establishing
liability. That said, it
is of course the case that the proper construction of
clause 4 of the relevant consultancy agreement will ultimately have an
important
bearing upon whether the Plaintiffs are or are not able to make out
that crucial aspect of their case.
<P>

10	However, the objections of the Defendant go beyond relevance. In particular
they are based firstly upon the premise that the
relevant Annexure A is
excluded as hearsay and fails to be reinstated as admissible under the
"business record" exception contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

11	The Defendant did not in the end press the argument that Annexure A was not
a business record. Rather it framed its objection
on the basis that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)(a)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> was applicable to exclude application of the business records
exception from the hearsay rule.  Subsection (3)(a) provides that the
relevant
exception does not apply to a representation "prepared or obtained for the
purpose of conducting, before or in contemplation
of or in connection with, an
Australian ...... proceeding."
<P>

12	Resolving whether or not Annexure A was prepared for the purpose of the
present proceeding is not without difficulty on the present
state of the
evidence before me. Clearly enough Annexure A constitutes a report prepared in
order to answer the subpoena of the Plaintiffs.
 However, that does not of
itself preclude Annexure A from coming within the relevant exception. This is
provided that the representations
constituted by it were representations in
business records that were previously made and <i>not</i> in contemplation of,
or in connection with the proceeding. In the present case, they have simply
been reproduced from existing computer
records but with formatting changes
and/or other deletions of irrelevant material. This is said to be as
contemplated by the provisions
facilitating proof of documents in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)(d)</a> and
(e) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

13	There is some tension between <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)</a> and the various gateways contained in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a>.  (It is not disputed that the gateway
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(4)</a> would not appear to be applicable in the circumstances,
having regard to the definition of the expression  "not available to a party"
contained in clause 5 of the Dictionary in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.) In particular
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)</a> could not override <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)</a>, in specifically precluding the exception to
the hearsay rule applying where <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)</a> in its terms are made out. Retrieval to
meet a subpoena with no change save from electronic to printed form could not
cause <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)</a> to apply. Likewise, mere omission of items which do not alter the
effect of what is sought to be admitted should not cause <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)</a> to apply. But
when adjustments go further than that, in order to meet the requirements of
litigation, the position may well be different
and requires to be tested.
<P>

14	These earlier gateways permit the proof of contents of documents by a device
that reproduces such contents. Thus <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)(d)</a> contemplates that a device to
reproduce information in electronic storage may, in the process of rendering it
available for use by
the court, both retrieve the electronic information and
collate it so it is thus useable.
<P>

15	The evidence given by Mr Bryce did not go beyond that contained in paragraph
9 of his affidavit in referring to the data being
formatted for use in an excel
spread sheet. It therefore would remain a matter for further examination
whether the "formatting" in
question was, or was not, such as to satisfy
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)(d)</a>, or was rendered inadmissible by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(3)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> as
having been reproduced with greater adaptation than mere retrieval and
collation. The Plaintiffs did not satisfy their onus of
proof in that regard
but that is not the end of the matter as I explain.
<P>

<b>Waiver of Evidence Rules -- s190(3)</b>
<P>

16	In all the circumstances, I consider that the proper course is rather to
deal with the matter by way of a waiver of the relevant
rules of evidence under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>. This is in the following terms.
<P>

"<b>(3)</b>	In a civil proceeding, the court may order that any one or more of
the provisions mentioned in subsection (1) do not apply in relation
to evidence
of:
<P>

(a)	the matter to which the evidence relates is not genuinely in dispute; or
<P>

(b)	the application of those provisions would case or involve unnecessary
expense or delay."
<P>

17	The matters a court may take into account in deciding whether to exercise
that power of waiver are set out more exhaustively
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(4)</a>, which I quote
below
<P>

"<b>(4)</b>	Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account
in deciding whether to exercise the power conferred by subsection
(3), it is to
take into account:
<P>

(a)	the importance of the evidence in the proceeding; and
<P>

(b)	the nature of the cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject
matter of the proceeding; and
<P>

(c)	the probative value of the evidence; and
<P>

(d)	the powers of the court (if any) to adjourn the hearing, to make another
order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence."
<P>

18	The present evidence is clearly important. Without it, the Plaintiffs cannot
quantify the amount of commission claimed and the
evidence is clearly only
obtainable for practical purposes in any comprehensive sense from Telstra. Its
probative value is subject
to further testing. But on the material before me is
likely to be of considerable importance in relation to damages, were liability
established.  Finally, adjourning the hearing is not likely to give scope for a
direction which would yield any more reliable --
and non hearsay -- version of
this material.
<P>

19	There is no doubt that the power to dispense with the rules in exceptional
cases is desirable, where this can fairly be done
to both parties. Thus
situations may arise which are not dealt with in the rules of evidence,
requiring flexibility to meet such
situations; see ALRC report 38 "Evidence" at
para 1025 citing Moffitt J in the <i>Pacific Acceptance Corporation Ltd v
Forsyth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2092%20WN%28NSW%29%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 92 WN(NSW) 29.</a> Thus, for example, the Federal Court
exercised power of waiver to facilitate survey evidence; <i>McDonald System of
Australia Pty Ltd v McWilliam's Wines Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20ATPR%2040%2d136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) ATPR 40-136.</a> Prima
facie, electronically recorded accounting data collated to provide only the
relevant material in answer to a subpoena, but
not so as to render misleading
or inaccurate what is represented, falls into a similar category, where strict
application of the
hearsay rule would otherwise work injustice. The question is
whether the conditions for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)</a> are made out, such that my discretion to
admit can then be exercised, with such considerations in mind.
<P>

20	The evidence given by Mr Bryce was to the effect that while recourse to the
primary records to attempt to reconstruct or verify
the position between 1
January 1995 and 30 June 1996 in relation to sponsorship payments would be a
difficult and expensive task,
for the period <i>after</i> 30 June 1996 the
position becomes relatively straightforward. It would involve perhaps some two
days of work to identify the primary
records from which Annexure A was
compiled.
<P>

21	Mr Bryce explained in his evidence that Annexure A depends upon identifying
sponsorship payments by reference to a particular
project, here sponsorship of
the Defendant. That identification involves allocation of a job number, as
occurred in the present case
after 30 June 1996. That job number was then used
so that an invoice was identified as belonging to that job number, and was thus
allocated to the relevant sponsorship.
<P>

22	His evidence was that such allocation when originally made was unlikely to
be erroneous.  He also said that reference to the
relevant primary material
to-day would be unlikely to show an allocation error, though he did not exclude
that possibility in a particular
case. But he also said that such verification
would in many cases not be possible.
<P>

23	I have some doubt as to whether therefore that exercise of correlating the
primary documents with the Annexure is capable of
demonstrating error though it
conceivably could. That does not preclude the Defendant having the opportunity
to essay that task if
it wishes.  Accordingly, in making the orders that I do,
I will include that the relevant primary material in the possession of Telstra
from which Annexure A has been compiled, should be made available to both
parties.
<P>

24	The critical matter to determine under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)</a> is whether either the matter
to which the evidence relates "is not genuinely in dispute" or whether
application of the relevant provisions,
in this case of the hearsay rule,
"would cause or involve unnecessary expense or delay," such as otherwise to
justify the discretionary
admission of this evidence.
<P>

25	So far as the latter is concerned, I am satisfied that the application of
the hearsay rule in the present circumstances to exclude
the admissibility of
Annexure A would cause or involve unnecessary expense or delay. It may indeed
not only do that, but be fundamentally
prejudicial to the Plaintiffs' proper
opportunity to establish, if it can, the damage that it has suffered.  This is
in circumstances
where, concededly, payments totalling $570,000, according to
the Defendant's acknowledgment, were made in 1995 and 1996. The Defendant
asserts that these constitute "the total sponsorship between the Defendant and
Telstra (see PXVD4) whilst the Plaintiffs say the
total is much higher, and
rely on Annexure A to establish that case.
<P>

26	The dispute accordingly relates to an amount above that figure. It would be
certainly productive of unnecessary expense or delay
to require the Plaintiffs
somehow to prove their case by reference to the primary material, when that
primary material has already
been collated in the form of Annexure A by a
party, namely Telstra, which could certainly not be said to be in the
Plaintiffs' camp.
<P>

27	Whether it could be said that the matter to which the evidence relates is
not genuinely in dispute is perhaps more arguable.
 The Defendant contends that
it does genuinely dispute not only the name of the payee being in truth the
payee, where the payee is
not identified as the Defendant, but also whether the
correct allocation has been carried out.  As against that, the PXVD4 in
conjunction
with PXVD2 indicates that the point had not been taken by way of
dispute earlier than the present hearing before me, in relation
to material of
a similar character but terminating at an earlier date.
<P>

28	The expression "the matter to which the evidence relates", appearing in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)</a> was paraphrased by Sperling J in <i>Cheryl Joan Roma v H J Wilson
Carriers Pty Ltd</i> (Sperling J, 9 August 1996, unreported) as "the matters of
fact contained in the materials in question". Here the matters of fact
contained in the materials in question are recorded in Annexure A to the
affidavit of Mr Bryce.  When one reads PXVD4, the Defendant's
disputation of
the overall amount is not expressed to be by reference to the unreliability of
such a schedule but is more generally
expressed. Thus it is said by the
Defendant's solicitors, "Your letter does not identify the nature of the claim
nor the legal justification
for the amount claimed".
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

29	However, even if one accepts that the Defendant genuinely disputes, now if
not then, the matters of fact contained in Annexure
A, I am satisfied that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)(b)</a> affords a sufficient basis in the present context to permit the
admissibility of Annexure A, for the reasons earlier stated.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

30	I order that the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> be
dispensed with in relation to Annexure A to the affidavit of Mr Bryce of 16
March 1999 (omitting the final and cumulative totals)
on terms that Telstra
Corporation Limited produce to the Plaintiffs and Defendant within twenty-one
days the primary documents, to
the extent Telstra Corporation are reasonably
able to do so, from whence Annexure A was obtained, unless both parties advise
Telstra
Corporation Limited that they do not require such primary documents.
