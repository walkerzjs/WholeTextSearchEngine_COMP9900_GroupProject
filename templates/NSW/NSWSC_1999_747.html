<P>

TUESDAY 27 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>13466/1995</u>	<u>THE ESTATE OF THE LATE HARRY DAVIS &amp; ANOR v HEATHER
LORRAINE WHEELIHAN</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced on 13 September 1995.  They came
on for hearing on 23 June 1999.  On that day, a proposed Amended
Statement of
Claim was handed up in Court.  Leave was given to make certain of the
amendments appearing in that document.
<P>

2  	The parties have relied on affidavit evidence.  The principal
deponent supporting the plaintiff's case is Mr Reeve (the solicitor
for the
plaintiff).  The defendant relies on affidavits sworn by herself and her
daughter (Fiona). Mr Reeve, the defendant and Fiona
have been cross-examined.
The parties have tendered documentation.
<P>

3  	The defendant is the registered proprietor of a residential
property at 6 Boundary Street Narrabri (the property).  In about
April 1994,
Fiona became acquainted with James Walton (Walton).  At that time, the
defendant had a loan with the Westpac Bank and
the amount outstanding was about
$8,000.00.  It was secured by a mortgage.  It seems that there had been a
Defence Service Loan.
 She had a personal loan with that Bank and about
$19,000.00 was outstanding.  She was also paying interest on a loan taken out
in
Fiona's name with the ANZ Bank.  The loan was for $7,000.00.  The purpose of
this loan was to fund a business course for Fiona. 
A relationship developed
between Fiona and Walton.  The involvement continued thereafter (probably at
least until Walton went to
prison in about May 1995).
<P>

4  	In about July 1994, Walton arranged a loan for $20,000.00 (a
"Household Continuing Credit Account") with Household Finance Services
(HFS).
The loan was taken out in the name of the defendant.  Walton had promised her
that he would make the payments due under the
loan.  He had earlier told her
that he wanted "to help pay Fiona's loan back".  Whilst she has said that there
is a forged signature
on the loan documentation, she participated in the
process that saw the loan being granted.  In the documentation, Walton is
mentioned
as "son in law" and the reason for the loan is said to be
"Renovations".  HFS lodged a caveat against the title to the property (there
may have been an equitable mortgage).  The evidence from the defendant is
unhelpful as to whether or not Walton made any payments
due under this loan.
<P>

5  	By about September 1994, Walton wanted to re-finance the loan
with HFS.  He told the defendant that he was going to borrow $40,000.00
to pay
off the house loan, the car loan, Fiona's ANZ loan, and the loan from HFS.
Again, the loan was to be in the defendant's name
and Walton said that he would
make the payments due under it.
<P>

6  	Mr Reeve conducts a legal practice at Tewantin in Queensland.  It
would seem that one part of his practice was to act for mortgagees.
 One of his
clients was the late Mr Harry Davis.  On 5 October 1994, he was contacted by Mr
Pierce who conducts business under the
name of Consumer Mortgage Australia
(CMA) as mortgage brokers.  It seems that the application documentation had
been taken to Mr
Pierce by Fiona.  An application for a loan in the sum of
$40,000.00 secured by mortgage was made on behalf of a client (Heather
Wheelihan).  The documentation was signed by the defendant.  It was forwarded
under cover of a letter dated 6 October 1994, which
contained the
following:-
<P>

"Please find enclosed application for finance for Mrs Weelian.  Please also
note that her son James (who you might remember as Nudge
in the TV series Hey
Dad) will be making the payment on the loan.  My client has agreed to an
interest rate of 12%."
<P>

Agreement was reached for such a loan with an interest rate of 12%.  Mr Reeve
prepared mortgage documents and these were forwarded
by letter to the
defendant.  The mortgage was signed by the defendant and her signature was
witnessed by Walton.  Thereafter, communication
was had with Walton and
executed documentation was returned to Mr Reeve.  The defendant says that it
was sent to him by Walton and
Fiona.
<P>

7  	A settlement took place on 2 November 1994.  On the same day, a
letter was sent by Mr Reeve to the defendant confirming that
settlement had
taken place and providing details of the application of the loan moneys.
Westpac was paid the sum of $8,726.81 and
a discharge of mortgage was obtained
from it.  A part of the loan was applied to meet costs and commission.  In
accordance with instructions
received from Walton, a cheque for the balance
made out to the defendant in the sum of $28,123.19 was sent to the Westpac Bank
at
Chatswood for deposit in an account styled "H L Wheelihan account number 732
- 090 - 500431".  As this was in fact Walton's account
the Bank deposited the
cheque in an account standing in the name of the defendant (an account at
Narrabri).  Thereafter, the defendant
paid all but a part of these moneys (such
part being in the sum of $2,123.19) to Walton (rather than apply them in
payment of the
outstanding loans).  Why this was done was left unexplained by
her.  There is material which throws up conflicting suggestions (Exhibit
A).
One suggestion is that the loan was obtained to enable Walton to meet his own
commitments.
<P>

8  	It may be said, at the very least, that Mr Reeve has handled the
transaction in a manner that was casual.  His conduct has been
the subject of
criticism.  However, largely any deficiencies in the conduct of the transaction
by him are not material to the matters
in issue in this case.  One matter does
require specific mention.
<P>

9  	Mr Reeve had overlooked the matter of the caveat lodged by HFS.
Some communication took place with Walton (see inter alia paragraph
28 of Mr
Reeve's affidavit sworn on 23 January 1998).  This did not lead to Walton
paying out HFS.  Thereafter arrangements were
made by Mr Reeve with HFS to have
the caveat withdrawn.  This was effected in June 1995 by Mr Davis paying out
the moneys claimed
by HFS.  The caveat was withdrawn and the mortgage was
registered.
<P>

10  	There has been default under the mortgage.  Only two payments
have been made (a sum of $400.00 on 18 November 1994 and the
sum of $400.00 on
16 December 1994).  These payments were made by the defendant.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff seeks both a monetary judgment and possession of
the property.  There are two real issues.  Firstly, whether
or not the
defendant is entitled to relief under either the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</u>
1980</a> (the Act) or other doctrines.  Secondly, whether or not an agreement was
made entitling the plaintiff to recover from the defendant
the moneys paid to
HFS to obtain the withdrawal of the caveat.  Save as to her claim for relief,
it is not disputed by the defendant
that the plaintiff has a prima facie case
founded upon default under the mortgage.
<P>

12  	In the course of the hearing Walton has been referred to as the
villain.  He has received from the defendant a significant
part of the advance
moneys.  He presented himself to the defendant and Fiona as an actor (the
suggestion that he played the role
of "Nudge" is apparently false) and a person
of wealth who could not presently put his hands on his money (it was said to
have been
tied up in a trust scheme until he was 25 years of age).  He was
presented by them as a person who repeatedly assured them that he
would pay
"everything".  Both the defendant and Fiona say in their respective affidavits
that they placed great trust in Walton.
<P>

13  	In one of her affidavits, the defendant deposed to the
following:-
<P>

"At all times I believed I was not taking out a mortgage.  I only acted in the
belief that Jamie Walton was going to service all
the loan. I acted as I did
because I believed Jamie Walton was honest and trustworthy and was acting for
my best interests."
<P>

14  	In her oral evidence, the defendant gave the impression that she
had been subjected to some pressure by Walton to sign documentation.
 Whilst
the affidavit material tended to convey the impression that the imprisonment of
Walton arose out of other activities, there
was oral and other material which
suggested that his conduct in relation to the loan transactions was at least
one of the reasons
why he was now in prison. The oral evidence of Fiona
revealed that she had visited him in prison (at least "a few times").  However,
inexplicably, she was simply unable to remember whether the visits numbered 5
or 50.
<P>

15  	At the end of the evidence, it could be said that the nature of
the relationship had between the Wheelihans and Walton remained
somewhat
puzzling and the conduct of the defendant and Fiona seemed to be inexplicable.
This may be because their evidence was unhelpful
in many respects and neither
of them gave a full nor frank picture of what really happened.  I shall mention
a few matters that emerged
from the evidence.  It appears that Walton and Fiona
lived together at some stage (at least about two months).  It appears that for
some time he stayed with the defendant at Narrabri whilst Fiona was in Sydney.
He was said to be burning or tearing up mail that
he did not want the defendant
to see.  Surprisingly, this conduct apparently did not bring about any
disturbance of the relationship.
 One feature of the relationship does seem to
be that if his promises to them had been fulfilled, the Wheelihans would have
received
the benefit of having their many debts paid off by him.
<P>

16  	Largely, the circumstances of the defendant may be gleaned from
her affidavits.  I shall merely mention some of the matters
that emerge from
the evidence.  She is a widow.  Her husband died in 1992.  She receives a
pension.  She works part-time as a casual
housemaid.  She was born on 3 August
1946.  She has lived in Narrabri all her life.  She attended Narrabri High
until the 8th grade.
<P>

17  	I shall now mention some of the matters, appearing from her
evidence, which she puts forward as relevant to her case.  She
says that she
did not understand the contract and merely signed what was put in front of her.
She says "I did not read the papers
which I was asked to sign".  She says that
"I received no independent legal or expert advice prior to the execution of the
mortgage".
 She says that none of the provisions of the mortgage were explained
to her as to their legal and practical effect.  She said that
she had only a
limited understanding of the nature of the provisions of the mortgage.
<P>

18  	I have closely observed the demeanour of the witnesses during
the giving of evidence.  In assessing credibility, I have had
regard both to
demeanour and evidence.
<P>

19  	The credibility of Mr Reeve is not of any real significance in
this case.  I formed the impression that he did his best to
give honest and
reliable evidence.  Although placed in circumstances of some embarrassment, he
gave the impression of being frank
and candid.  Largely, I accept his
evidence.
<P>

20  	Whilst the Court has great sympathy for the position in which
the defendant is placed, it is still necessary to observe that
there were
aspects of her evidence which were less than impressive.  She was often
disposed to give unresponsive answers to questions.
 On some occasions there
was no answer and at times she resorted to reading her affidavit before
providing any response.  In a number
of respects, her evidence was less than
frank.  There were differences in presentation between her affidavit and oral
material. 
Her evidence is at odds with what may be gleaned from other material
(such as Exhibit A).  I was left with the impression that the
case presented by
the evidence of the defendant and Fiona did not accord with what in fact was
the real position.  She has given
evidence that I do not accept.
<P>

21  	I shall specifically refer to one particular matter.  I do not
accept her evidence that she believed that she was not taking
out a mortgage or
evidence to the effect that she lacked understanding as to what a mortgage was
about.  She gave the impression
of being keen to stress what she says had been
said to her by Walton and to avoid disclosing her actual knowledge.  Prior to
the
granting of the subject mortgage, she had been involved with a prior
mortgage.  She conceded that she knew what a mortgage was. 
She conceded that
she was aware that if the payments were not maintained she could lose her home.
She conceded that she was aware
that if Walton did not make the payments she
would have to.  Despite some less than impressive evidence to the effect that
Walton
either burnt or tore up (or both) correspondence, she received the
mortgage documents from Mr Reeve.  She saw that they had "Mortgage"
on them
prior to signing them.  Both in her affidavit and her oral evidence, she speaks
of them as "the mortgage papers" (see para.
14 and p. 41).  Her expressed
concern at not wanting to give a mortgage, reinforces the view that she had an
appreciation of what
a mortgage involved.  In her affidavit Fiona deposes that
her mother said "These are the mortgage papers involved with this loan"
(see
para. 14).  She was aware that the prior mortgage would be discharged and
replaced by the subject mortgage.  She has conceded
that the consolidation of
the various debts into one loan at least ultimately, had some attraction for
her.
<P>

22  	There was also the evidence of Fiona.  In the main, it seems to
be non-contentious, that considerable of her evidence lacks
relevance.  There
were discrepancies between her evidence and that of the defendant.  To the
extent that it may be of significance,
I observe that she has given evidence
that I do not accept.
<P>

23  	Counsel have made submissions in writing.  These submissions
have been supplemented orally.  For present purposes, it is not
necessary to
repeat the detail of the matters raised in the submissions.
<P>

24  	Firstly, I shall turn to the matter of the relief claimed by the
defendant.  Apart from seeking relief under the Act, the defendant
also looks
to the principles of unconscionability and undue influence.  Save for what has
been referred to as an extension of <u>Garcia v The National Australia Bank</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20155%20ALR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 155 ALR 614</a>, the defendant accepts that her strongest case is that which
is propounded under the Act.  In the circumstances of this case, I am
not
satisfied that any case is made out for relief under the principles of
unconscionability or undue influence.  It was put that
this should be seen as a
mother and son case and that <u>Garcia </u>should be extended to such a
situation.  In my view, leaving aside the question of whether or not
<u>Garcia</u> can be so extended, <u>Garcia</u> has no application in the
circumstances of this case.
<P>

25  	During submissions, counsel referred the Court to many
authorities.  Largely, they include the authorities which are usually
quoted in
cases of this nature (including <u>West v AGC (Advances) Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR
610</a></u>, <u>Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 1</a></u>,
<u>Beneficial Finance Corporation v Karavas  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 256</a></u>).  The
observation may be made that whilst other cases provide guidance, each case
tends to turn on its own particular facts and
the considerations of the public
interest.
<P>

26  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> confers a discretion on the Court to grant any one or
more of the heads of relief identified therein where it finds that certain
threshold requirements have been satisfied (inter alia, where it finds a
contract to have been unjust in the circumstances relating
to it at the time it
was made).  See <u>Nguyen v Taylor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 48</a> at 55-57 and 71-72
and <u>Younan &amp; Anor v Beneficial Finance Corporation Limited</u> (Court of
Appeal, 21 November 1994).  It may grant relief if it considers it just to do
so and for the purpose of avoiding as far
as practicable an unjust consequence
or result.
<P>

27  	In my view, the defendant falls well short of satisfying the
relevant threshold requirements and/or demonstrating an entitlement
to relief.
I do not propose to further canvass all of the relevant circumstances.
However, I will advert further to some of them.
<P>

28  	Whilst by at least February 1998 she had retained the services
of a solicitor, it appears that she did not seek any expert
advice prior to the
execution of the mortgage.  The defendant's evidence does not assist as to the
reasoning process behind the obtaining
of legal assistance at that time.  It
may have been precipitated by the activities of Walton and directed to
obtaining relief against
him.  In any event it does suggest that she knew
advice could be obtained if she had wanted it.  Her evidence does not suggest
that
she in fact wanted any advice in relation to the mortgage prior to its
execution.  It does not inform as to whether or not any such
advice would have
dissuaded her from proceeding with the mortgage.   Whilst the provisions of the
mortgage were not explained to
her by the mortgagee, she had an understanding
of a mortgage.  She was aware that she could lose her home.
<P>

29  	The lender was approached through a mortgage broker on behalf of
the defendant.  There was some negotiation as to the interest
rate.  There was
an acceptance of the interest rate required by the lender.  There is material
which suggests that the lender was
led to believe that the loan was required
for the purpose of a consolidation of debts.  This was not unusual in the case
of the type
of mortgage transaction handled by Mr Reeve on behalf of his
clients.  It appears that these were transactions which came into being
when a
borrower could not get finance elsewhere.  The mortgage was given for a short
period at a fixed interest rate.  The concern
for the mortgagee was that there
was sufficient security in the event of default.  The lender was aware of some
urgency.  Again,
this was not an usual matter.  The involvement of the putative
"Son" and the material indicating that he would be making the payments
was not
such in the circumstances of this case as to put the mortgagee on notice.
<P>

30  	The mortgage documents were sent to the defendant by the
mortgagee and were received by her.  She executed them.  Also, she
did what was
necessary to bring about the discharge of the existing mortgage, so that the
subject mortgage could replace it.  She
knew that she was giving a mortgage
over the property.
<P>

31  	The advance was in fact made to and received by her.
Thereafter, she handed over a significant part of it to Walton.  Why this
was
done and what happened to these moneys was left unexplained by the defendant.
There is material which suggests that initially
a bank cheque was obtained to
pay out the HFS loan and that then there was a change of mind which saw funds
being credited to Walton's
account in accordance with directions given by the
defendant.
<P>

32  	Her evidence was calculated to give an impression that differed
from what really happened.  She sought to convey the impression
that the only
benefit received was having the existing mortgage paid out and receiving a
small part of the advance.  Not only did
she receive the moneys advanced, as
matters presently stand she has had the benefit of the HFS loan being paid out
by the mortgagee
(who may not be able to recover these moneys from her).  What
she did not get is the benefit of what had been promised to her by
Walton.  If
this had happened, she would have been debt free with the debts having been
paid by Walton.
<P>

33  	The general policy of the law is that parties should honour
their contracts (<u>Baltic Shipping</u> at p.9).  It is unfortunate that part
of the loan moneys have been lost to her.  But the fact is that the loss was a
consequence
of her own foolishness.  The mortgagee was not aware of the
relationship involving the defendant and Walton and I am not satisfied
that it
is something of which he should have been aware.  It is one of those cases,
where the plaintiff may be said to fall within
the category of an innocent
party (<u>Karavas</u> at P. 277).
<P>

34  	The mortgage was in standard form.  Save as to one matter, it
was not said that any of the provisions of the mortgage itself
would attract
relief.  No complaint was made about the interest rate of 12% (which was the
subject of negotiation).  There was some
complaint about the penalty interest
rate (which was 15%).  I am not satisfied that this complaint is of any
substance.
<P>

35  	I now turn to the question of the agreement alleged by the
plaintiff as the basis for the recovery of the amount paid to effect
the
withdrawal of the caveat.  The agreement was alleged to have been made by
Walton as agent for the defendant with Mr Reeve.  It
is said to arise from what
is deposed to in paragraph 28 of the affidavit sworn by Mr Reeve on 23 January
1998.
<P>

36  	In my view, this claim was doomed to failure.  I am not
satisfied that Walton had authority to enter into any agreement of
that nature.
I am not satisfied that what is deposed to in the affidavit would in any event
give rise to an agreement of the nature
as alleged (or an agreement at all).
Further, I am not satisfied that there was the requisite consideration to
support the alleged
agreement.
<P>

37  	It may be that there is some other basis on which these moneys
may be recovered (such as pursuant to the terms of the mortgage
or on a common
money count).  Be that as it may, these matters were not raised in the pleading
and were not canvassed during the
hearing and I put them aside.  The only claim
propounded was that founded on the alleged agreement.
<P>

38  	I order that the Cross-claim be dismissed.  I order that the
defendant pay the costs of the Cross-claim.  I order that the
claim founded on
the alleged agreement be dismissed.  Save as to the making of these orders,
there may be a problem at this stage
in taking the matter further.  There is an
entitlement to relief under the mortgage.  It may suffice if relief is
restricted to a
judgment for possession.  The proceedings may not be presently
properly constituted on the plaintiff's side of the record.  The plaintiff
died
some time ago and the proceedings presently seem to be maintained in the name
of a non-legal entity (the Estate of the late
Harry Davis).  This is a matter
which would seem to require attention before further orders can be made.  When
this aspect of the
matter has been satisfactorily dealt with, counsel for the
plaintiff should prepare Short Minutes of Order.  It seems to me that
the
defendant should bear the costs of the plaintiff's claim, save for that part
which was founded on the alleged agreement.
