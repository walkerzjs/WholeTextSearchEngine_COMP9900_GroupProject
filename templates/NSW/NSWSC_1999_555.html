Sydney 11 June 1999
<P>

Elspan International Limited v. Eurocopter International Pacific Ltd and
ors.
<P>

Proceedings 55047/97 and 55046/98
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	On 14 October 1998 the second defendant (`the Arbitrator'), made an interim
award in an arbitration between the plaintiff, Elspan
International Limited
(`Elspan') and the first defendant, Eurocopter International Pacific Limited
(`Eurocopter') with respect to
a cross-claim brought by Elspan against
Eurocopter.  Elspan was awarded an amount of $18,874 plus interest.  Costs were
reserved
and remain reserved.
<P>

2	There are before the Court two sets of proceedings in which Elspan seeks to
impugn the award.
<P>

3	In proceedings 55047 of 1998, Elspan seeks orders pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
42(1)(a)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a> (NSW</i>) (`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>')
setting aside parts of the Award on the ground that there is said to have been
legal and/or technical misconduct on the part of
the Arbitrator or
alternatively, the Arbitrator is said to have misconducted the proceedings.
Those parts of the Award which Elspan
seeks to be set aside are:
<P>

	(a)	Paragraphs 51-54 and the rejection by the Arbitrator of Elspan's claim for
$3,600 for higher strength concrete in wall panels.
<P>

	(b)	Paragraphs 63-69 leading to Elspan's claim of a further amount of $78,300
in respect of jacking.
<P>

	(c)	Paragraphs 103-105 leading to the rejection of Elspan's claim of $10,625
for awning canopies.
<P>

	(d)	Paragraphs 109-111 leading to the rejection of Elspan's claim of
$14,343.28 for a hangar crane.
<P>

	(e)	Paragraphs 117-123 leading to the rejection of Elspan's further claim of
$21,752 for doors.
<P>

4	Orders are sought remitting the issues submitted to the Arbitrator for
determination but said to have been left undetermined by
him, namely:
<P>

	(a)	the scrap value of steel in the steel building;  and
<P>

	(b)	the value of plans for the works.
<P>

5	The orders seek for these matters to be remitted to a new Arbitrator, or
alternatively to the Arbitrator, for determination.
<P>

6	Eurocopter is the first defendant.  The Arbitrator is joined as second
defendant.  An order is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 44(a)</a> and/or 44(c) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, removing the second defendant as Arbitrator.
<P>

7	As against both defendants, Elspan seeks pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11(1)(a)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> that the Court appoint a new Arbitrator to deal with those matters remitted
to the Arbitrator and to finalise all outstanding issues.
 Alternatively,
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 43</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, Elspan seeks that those parts of the
Arbitrator's award dealing with the matter of concrete strength and identified
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> of the Notice of Contentions be remitted to the Arbitrator to be
reconsidered in the light of the Court's judgment and for the Arbitrator
to
determine the further issues submitted to him for determination but not
determined by him.
<P>

8	The second set of proceedings, number 55046 of 1998, are also proceedings
brought against Eurocopter.  Elspan seeks leave to appeal
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
38(4)(b)</a> as read with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(i)</a> and (ii) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, against those parts of the Award identified in Elspan's contentions
section (C) of the Summons.  Section (C) deals with a number
of discrete
matters which will be referred to below.  In a number of instances, the matters
which require consideration and are dealt
with in the two summonses are the
same but plainly different principles apply.
<P>

	<b>Background to the Arbitration</b>
<P>

9	On 19 February 1990, Aerospatiale Holdings Australia Pty Limited
(`Aerospatiale Holdings') and Elspan entered into a contract
for the design and
construction of an office and hangar complex at Bankstown Airport.  The
agreement had a contract sum of some $2.4million.
 Elspan is a company
incorporated in Hong Kong.
<P>

10	The design of the two-level office building was described by the Arbitrator
in paragraph 2 of the Award as `a lift slab building
whereby the first and roof
slabs were cast at ground level and subsequently lifted into position by a
jacking process'.  Post-tensioned
concrete is said to have been employed in the
ground floor raft slab at grade, the suspended slabs and wall panels.  The
steel structure
of the hangar involved an innovative design and construction
method involving post-tensioning principles.
<P>

11	Work on that project is said to have commenced in about February 1990.
Disputes arose thereafter between the parties concerning
the execution of the
works and an arbitration clause in the original agreement was enlivened
following which, in about July 1991,
Mr J.I. Muirhead was appointed as
Arbitrator.  Following a period of negotiation, a second agreement was entered
into and it is this
agreement which is the subject of the arbitration leading
to the Award now in dispute.  Parties to this second agreement were
Aerospatiale
Helicopters Australia Limited (which was described as the owner)
Aerospatiale Holdings and Elspan.  Subsequently, Aerospatiale Helicopters
Australia Limited changed its name to Eurocopter International Pacific Limited
(`Eurocopter').  The agreement in effect named Elspan
(Australia) Pty Limited
as Elspan's representative in performance of its obligations under the
agreement in Australia - clause 16.2.
 The agreement was described by the
Arbitrator as one in respect of which Elspan was to complete the remaining
works for a contract
sum of $910,400.  The scope of the remaining works was
particularised in a schedule `A' to the second agreement and payment stages
were set out in a schedule `D'.  [Award paragraph 4]
<P>

12	Elspan was required to bring the remaining works to practical completion by
24 January 1992 or such date as may be extended pursuant
to the agreement.  The
remaining works under the second agreement commenced, but further disputes
arose and on 10 February 1992,
Eurocopter purported to terminate the agreement
and took possession of the site.  It was common ground before the Arbitrator
that
Eurocopter had paid Elspan the total sum of $581,000 under the second
agreement.
<P>

13	Disputes which then arose resulted in a dual arbitration and reference to
the Honourable Gordon Samuels AC QC under the provisions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and
pursuant to Part 72 of the <i>Supreme Court Rules</i>.  That dual process
apparently arose as the disputes involved parties other than those who were
parties to the Arbitration Agreement
in the second agreement.
<P>

14	Mr Samuels only considered Eurocopter's claim against Elspan, Elspan's
cross-claim being stayed pending Elspan providing security
for Eurocopter's
costs.  Ultimately, in the combined referee's report and award of 23 July 1993,
Mr Samuels found in favour of Elspan
as follows:
<P>

	(a)	Eurocopter's claims of its lawful termination were dismissed.
<P>

	(b)	Eurocopter's purported termination was held itself to amount to a
repudiation.
<P>

	(c)	Elspan's notice of 24 February 1992 was held to have effect as an
acceptance of that repudiation and a termination by Elspan
of the Agreement.
<P>

	(d)	Because Eurocopter's unjustified termination amounted to a breach of the
Agreement, the mutual waivers for which clause 2.2(b)
provided, were
enlivened.
<P>

15	Mr Samuels' report was brought down on 23 July 1993.
<P>

16	On 27 May 1994, Mr Samuels brought down a referee's report and decision
(award) on costs.  In that award, Mr Samuels made certain
findings in relation
to Mr Peter Ellen's conduct before the Tribunal which the Arbitrator, Mr
Markham, adopted pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> - see paragraph 11 award.
<P>

17	On 28 July 1994, Mr Samuels awarded that Elspan provide security for
Eurocopter's costs and stayed the cross-claim until security
was provided.  At
that time, Elspan's cross-claim pleaded a claim in quantum meruit, unjust
enrichment and four other heads of damages.
 Elspan then elected to only pursue
its claim in quantum meruit and subsequently in an interim award, Mr Samuels
reduced the security
previously ordered to be paid and continued the stay of
proceedings until the security was provided.
<P>

18	On 3 April 1996 by consent of the parties, Hunter J ordered that Mr Markham
be appointed Arbitrator in the arbitration in place
of Mr Samuels.  The Court
consented to the parties agreement that the Arbitrator have jurisdiction in
terms of security for costs
and a stay.
<P>

19	After some further applications before the Arbitrator, relating to an
amendment foreshadowed by Elspan to its cross-claim, so
as to include loss of
profits in addition to a quantum meruit, and in relation to a stay application,
Elspan elected only to press
its cross-claim for a quantum meruit and provided
the security as ordered.  The security for costs decision of the Arbitrator
included
a finding that some evidence given in the hearing was relevant to the
cross-claim and should not be adduced again at the later hearing,
other than by
reference.
<P>

20	Eurocopter's original defence to the cross-claim sought a set-off against
any quantum meruit in respect of rectification of defects
and unsatisfactory
workmanship, but Eurocopter subsequently abandoned that limb of its defence.
<P>

21	Elspan's cross-claim was pleaded as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The cross-Claimant alleges that the value of the work completed and
material supplied to complete "the Remaining Works" exceeds the
total sum paid
by the Cross-Respondent to the Cross-Claimant in respect of such work and
materials.</i>
<P>

<i>	The Cross-Claimant claims in quantum meruit for the value of the work
completed and materials supplied to complete "the Remaining
Works" and for
which it has not been paid by the Cross-Respondent.'</i>
<P>

22	During its case, Elspan extended its quantum meruit claim to include
obligations incurred for elements of work not supplied and
further, a claimed
entitlement to interest, being a special detriment, on certain Hong Kong loan
accounts with Westpac.  The cross
claim finally pressed sought an amount of
approximately A$1.195 million.
<P>

23	As part of the background material, it is necessary to note that the
Arbitrator held hearings from 30 April 1996 to 22 September
1997, during which
14 full hearing days were occupied.  Counsel for Eurocopter had suggested that
the issues be narrowed by the parties
attempting to reach agreement wherever
possible and at the same time to identify the areas in dispute.  The Arbitrator
who had thought
this to be a good idea had said "I believe that the most
effective way of doing this would be to have a short adjournment and for
counsel for both parties to sit down with the affidavits and statements of
Messrs Ellen, Stone and Islaub and reach agreement where
possible on those
paragraphs which are not to be read".  This was followed with the Arbitrator
stating, "Yes, obviously, if there
is an item which is not agreed, then the
paragraph has got to remain (sic) and be read".  This was the background to the
non-reading
of certain paragraphs of Mr John Ellen's affidavit.
<P>

24	The Arbitrator required the expert quantity surveyors to prepare a joint
report which they did on 27 June 1997 (`the Joint Report').
 The quantity
surveyor called by Eurocopter was Mr Moir.  The quantity surveyor called by
Elspan was Mr Horley.
<P>

25	Certain further questions were put to the quantity surveyors who prepared a
second report.
<P>

26	In the Joint Report, Eurocopter's quantity surveyor marked some items which
it claimed had been paid for under the first contract
by Aerospatiale.  The
Arbitrator rejected the submission that Eurocopter would be entitled to claim a
set-off of the amount of such
items.  
<P>

27	As has already been mentioned, the parties agreed on a list of factual
issues.  This agreement took place on 28 June 1997.  The
agreed list of issues
for determination was reduced to writing in Exhibit P5.  [See Tab 27 of Exhibit
PX]
<P>

	<b>The Relevant Principles</b>
<P>

28	As Brooking J stated in <i>Stannard v Sperway Constructions Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1990/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] VicRp 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20VR%20673" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) VR 673</a> at 678:
<P>

	<i>`. . . "Misconduct", when used in relation to Arbitrators, is a term of art
and one which, as the inclusive definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> accepts, cannot be succinctly
defined.  It is rather like the elephant - we know it when we see it.  If we
are in doubt we may gain
assistance from the books, where we will however find
no rigid definition of the species but instead statements of principle and
multifarious examples of their application.'</i>
<P>

29	In <i>Doran Constructions Pty Limited v Health Administration Corporation of
NSW &amp; Anor</i> (Unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 10 October
1994) Kirby P at pages 8 to 9 made a number of observations with respect
to use
of the word `misconduct' referred to in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  These included the statement
that the term may not, by the authorities, amount to much more than such a
mishandling of the arbitration
as to be likely to amount to a substantial
miscarriage of justice.  However, the mere failure to put a party on notice of
an argument
as to a point which might be decided against it might not, in the
context of an arbitration, necessarily amount to misconduct.
<P>

30	Mere delay must be adjudicated in context on each occasion. 
<P>

31	Elspan seeks leave to appeal against the interim award in respect of
questions of law arising out of the Award pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
As no consent has been given to the bringing of an appeal, the leave of the
Court is required for the bringing of the appeal [section
38(4)(b) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>].
<P>

32	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 38(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> provides:
<P>

	<i>`The Supreme Court shall not grant leave under sub-section (4)(b) unless it
considers that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	having regard to all the circumstances, the determination of the
question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights
of one or more
of the parties to the arbitration agreement;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	there is :</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	a manifest error of law on the face of the award;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	strong evidence that the arbitrator or umpire made an error of law,
and that the determination of the question may add, or may
be likely to add,
substantially to the certainty of commercial law.'</i>
<P>

33	Elspan asserted, as I understood it, that the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
38(5)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(i)</a> or (ii) were satisfied.
<P>

34	The principles dealing with applications of this type were generally dealt
with in <i>Horizons Corporation Pty Ltd v Lahey Constructions Pty Ltd
</i>(Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 November 1998, Einstein
J).  In that decision, the principles laid down by the New
South Wales Court of
Appeal in <i>Promenade Investments Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2026%20NSWLR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 26 NSWLR 203</a> and in <i>Natoli v Walker</i> (Unreported, Court of Appeal,
26 May 1994) were repeated.  In short, as those decisions make clear, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
38(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> sets a number of thresholds which must be surmounted by an
applicant before leave to appeal can be granted.
<P>

35	It is unnecessary to here repeat those statement of principle which are
adopted.  In particular, the expression `error of law
in the face of the
award', is used in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> to indicate something evident or obvious rather than
arguable.  The word `manifest' requires swift and easy persuasion and rapid
recognition of a suggested error.
<P>

36	A number of the issues raised by Elspan were relevant to both the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a>
and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38</a> proceedings, although obviously put in different (but
sometimes overlapping) ways in each suit.  The convenient way forward is to
deal with Elspan's claims, as appropriate making plain whether and if so how, a

	<b>The credit findings against Mr John Ellen</b>
<P>

37	Mr John Ellen, a director of Elspan Australia, was described by the
Arbitrator in paragraph 23 of the Award as `the authorised
representative of
Elspan in the cross-claim'.  Mr John Ellen gave evidence.  During the original
and the second agreements, Mr Ellen
was responsible for the management of the
construction works on site.
<P>

38	In paragraphs 24, 25 and 26 of the Award, the Arbitrator stated as
follows:
<P>

	<i>'24.	During the hearing before Mr Samuels on Eurocopter's and Aerospatiale
Holdings' claims, in the main, Mr Ellen conducted Elspan's
defence.  Mr Samuels
had found at that time, that he regarded Mr John Ellen as, on the whole, a
reliable witness who endeavoured
to describe events as he believed them to have
occurred.  Later in his report, he qualified this by saying that, as might be
expected,
Mr Ellen's evidence was affected by his advocate's role and that he
was adversely influenced by his understandable attempts to give
evidence from
the Bar table.</i>
<P>

<i>	25.  	In his later report and decision on costs dated 27 May 1994, the
former learned Arbitrator came to the conclusion that Mr John
Ellen had
deliberately decided not to inform the Tribunal of the substantial legal work
undertaken by Elspan's solicitor and that
this was in order to obtain the
forensic advantage in procedural matters that a litigant in person might enjoy
(P19-P21).  This deception
was clearly of concern to Mr Samuels as it is to me.
In my opinion, it demonstrates bias on Mr Ellen's part over a continuing
period.
 </i><cite>Mr Ellen's credibility was the subject of several attacks by
counsel for Eurocopter during the hearing and in submissions</cite><i>.  I will
return to this matter later.</i>
<P>

<i>	26.	During the security for costs hearing, I accepted that Elspan was
probably owned by Muse Consultants Limited.  </i><cite>In that hearing, Mr
Ellen gave evidence that Muse owned no assets.  I found this evidence to be
non-persuasive, absent supporting
documents</cite><i>.  I made this finding at
a time when I had not read Mr Samuels' report and decision on costs.'
</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

39	In paragraphs 46 and following of the Award, the Arbitrator dealt with
matters touching Elspan's claim for additional concrete
additives.  This was a
claim for the value of higher strength concrete in wall panels.
<P>

40	Paragraphs 46 through to 54 inclusive, are in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>'46.	The quantity surveyors assumed that the wall panels were constructed
with a characteristic concrete strength F'c of 35 or 32
MPa.  Based on concrete
test cores out from the </i><cite>floor slabs</cite><i>, Mr Ellen told Mr
Horley:</i>
<P>

<i>	"That the strength of concrete used in the wall panels is 65MPa"</i>
<P>

<i>	47.	Assuming this fact, Mr Horley recommended that the value of the
concrete in the wall panels be increased by $3,600.  Mr Moir
generally agreed
on the same assumption.</i>
<P>

<i>	48.	What Mr Ellen did not do was to refer Mr Horley to page 1 of Schedule B
of the second agreement which specified that the wall
panels were to have a
characteristic concrete strength F'c of 40MPa. F'c or more correctly f'c is
defined in AS 3600 - 1988, the
Concrete Structures Standard.</i>
<P>

<i>	49.	I have not been able to identify with certainty what concrete strength
was specified for the floor and roof slabs.  Page 26 of
the specification,
which formed part of the original agreement, scheduled the concrete strengths,
as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	"Minimum Design F'c = 40MPa and 50MPa"</i>
<P>

<i>	50.	From this, I think it is reasonable to infer from Elspan's
specification that F'c 50 MPa concrete was probably specified for
the suspended
slabs.  With grade 50 MPa concrete specified, compressive strength test results
in the range of 55 MPa to above 60
MPa could be expected and this is consistent
with the core strength tests.</i>
<P>

<i>	51.	Mr Ellen in his affidavit said that the same specification concrete was
used throughout the works and that the effective concrete
strength was 65.5
MPa.  Effective concrete strength is not a term normally used by engineers.  On
this issue, I have formed the view
that Mr Ellen, who is an experienced
engineer, deliberately sought to mislead Mr Horley and the tribunal, to
Elspan's advantage,
in an attempt to increase a sum agreed by the quantity
surveyors.</i>
<P>

<i>	52.	As the quantity surveyors had assumed a panel strength of F'c 32 or 35
MPa and Elspan's specification stated F'c 40 MPa, an increase
of $600 is
appropriate for the concrete wall panels.</i>
<P>

<i>	53.	Based on Mr Samuels' adverse finding on Mr Ellen's conduct, Mr Ellen's
evidence on the Muse matter, both referred to earlier
and his deception, which
seems to me deliberate, on the concrete panel strength issue, I have
significant reservations concerning
Mr Ellen's credibility.  As a consequence,
I do not accept Mr Ellen's evidence unless it is corroborated by independent
documents
or other credible material.</i>
<P>

<i>	54.	Mr Ellen also sought an extra allowance in the concrete wall panels for
the use of a wax emulsion, retarder and superplasticiser
additives which he
said were not available in Australia.  Later in oral evidence, he quantified
this as an extra cost of $3,108.85
to what the quantity surveyors had agreed.
Mr Moir's evidence was that the rates used would cover the cost of additives
and I accept
this.  I say in passing, that concrete additives of the kind
described were available and in use in Australia in 1990 and 1991.'</i>
<P>

41	In paragraph 16 of his affidavit, sworn on 2 July 1997, Mr John Ellen had
maintained that `the effective compressive strength
of the concrete was
65.5Mpa, based upon an average of the core samples divided by 0.85 as per the
concrete code, being slightly more
than double the strength assumed by Mr
Horley'.
<P>

42	Elspan has pointed out that the contents of paragraph 16 of Mr Ellen's
affidavit was not challenged in cross-examination by Eurocopter's
counsel.
Read before the Court was an affidavit made by Mr John Ellen on 18 December
1998 in which, in paragraph 7.91 he deposes
that he was not cross-examined on
his statement in paragraph 16 of his affidavit of 2 July 1997.  He further
deposes that the Arbitrator
did not question him on those allegations and that
neither the Arbitrator nor Eurocopter's counsel put to him that there was a
conflict
between the allegations in paragraph 16 and any provision of the
second contract.  He further deposes as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Had I been afforded an opportunity to explain, I would have stated that
"effective concrete strength" is the actual concrete strength
that we sought to
achieve and did achieve on the project greater than the concrete specifications
provided for in the contract. 
The reason I use the word "effective" is that
the concrete strength is arrived at by calculation as specified in my affidavit
and
is clearly laid down in the Concrete Code and that this figure differs from
concrete core compressive strength as used in the "Eurocopter"
tests.</i>
<P>

<i>	Furthermore, that the core samples which were obtained by Eurocopter for
the floor slabs were similar in value to the compression
tests taken by Elspan
for other concrete structures in the project.  I could have provided the
results of these tests if asked for.
 In addition, if I had been asked about
whether I had referred Mr Horley to the concrete specifications in the contract
I would have
said that I did provide the contract together with those
specifications to Mr Horley and I expected him to produce his report taking
into account those specifications.  I did not pick up his error until I was
working on my affidavit.  In summary I would have confirmed
my affidavit
evidence had I been given the opportunity.'</i>
<P>

43	Mr Ellen also deposed that he had not been cross-examined in regard to the
assets of Muse and that it had not been put to him
that any evidence which he
gave concerning Muse was false.
<P>

44	Elspan submits that for these reasons, there has been misconduct on behalf
of the Arbitrator which has unjustly prejudiced Elspan.
 Elspan submits that
the Arbitrator did not act fairly and did not give the appearance of acting
fairly and impartially.
<P>

45	Eurocopter accepts that the Arbitrator erred in paragraph 26 of the Award
when he stated that in the hearing [this was the security
for costs hearing],
Mr Ellen had given evidence that Muse owned no assets.  Eurocopter accepts that
the Arbitrator's finding that
Mr Ellen deliberately sought to mislead the
expert witness, Mr Horley, [paragraph 51 Award] was not put to Elspan's counsel
by the
Arbitrator during the proceedings.
<P>

46	Paragraph 51 of the Award has already been set out.
<P>

47	Eurocopter submits that those matters did not lead to procedural unfairness
and did not amount to misconduct.  Nine reasons are
put forward for this
submission.  These are as follows:
<P>

	<i>`10(i)	In paragraphs 25 and 26 of his award, the arbitrator was considering
the finding of the previous arbitrator, Mr Samuels QC,
that Mr John Ellen had
deliberately deceived Mr Samuels.  In his award, paragraph 26, the present
arbitrator recalled that he made
the (erroneous) finding regarding John
Elspan's evidence about the assets of Mews at a time when he was not aware of
Mr Samuels'
finding of deception.  He said that in effect in paragraph
26.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The arbitrator based his credit finding in paragraph 53 on three
matters:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the previous arbitrator's adverse finding of deception by Mr Ellen;
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the (erroneous) finding by the present arbitrator on the Mews matter;
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Mr Ellen's attempted deception of the expert, Mr Horley, as found in
paragraph 51 of the award (which finding was not based upon
the erroneous
finding as to the Mews matter).</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	In paragraph 53 of his award, the arbitrator relied upon:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	two matters of proven deception, viz the deception of Mr Samuels
(paragraph 25) and the attempt to deceive Mr Horley (paragraph
51);  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	one matter of evidence that he found merely to be "non-persuasive",
viz, John Ellen's evidence that Mews had no assets (paragraph
26).  Only this
last matter was an error.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The arbitrator had ample grounds to draw the conclusion against John
Ellen's credit at the end of paragraph 53.  The written
submissions of
Eurocopter to the arbitrator had made numerous assertions against the credit
and truthfulness of John Ellen, and in
those submissions the arbitrator was
urged not to accept any of Mr Ellen's evidence.  John Ellen's credit was also
dealt with in
Elspan's submissions to the arbitrator in reply, commencing at
paragraph 1 of those submissions.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The relevant finding in paragraph 50, as to concrete strength, was not
based upon the Ellen credit finding in paragraph 53, rather
it was based upon
the arbitrator's assessment of the specification and documentary evidence of
concrete strength, and upon Mr Ellen's
attempted deception of Mr Horley.  Such
reliance upon the attempted Horley deception was without error.  The finding in
paragraph
50 was not based on error.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	It is submitted that the findings upon concrete strength (paragraphs
46-52) contain no error, and the arbitrator was not incorrect
in his approach
in determining concrete strength by reference to Elspan's specification and
compressive test results and by his refusal
to rely upon a mere assertion by
John Ellen as to alleged actual concrete strength.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	It is submitted that the findings as to concrete additives (paragraph
54) were not in error.  The arbitrator accepted the evidence
of the expert, Mr
Moir, that the rates used covered the cost of additives.  Mr Moir's evidence on
that point was not challenged.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	Ultimately, the finding of deception by John Ellen was not part of
the reasoning process wherein the arbitrator accepted the
evidence of the
expert.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	Further, the approach taken by the arbitrator was not different to
that of the parties, that is they presented their evidence
in the joint report
of the expert for each of the parties and the arbitrator applied that evidence
in paragraph 54:  compare Giles
J in Motrix Supplies Pty Limited v Bonds &amp;
Kirby Pty Limited (unreported, Supreme Court NSW, 12 September 1990).'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Eurocopter's outline submissions, 6 May 1999, Part B]
<P>

48	Eurocopter's alternative submission is put in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`Alternatively, if Elspan was prejudiced by the error regarding Mr Ellen's
evidence as to the Mews assets, it is submitted that the
error did not
"unjustly prejudice" Elspan, within the principle stated by Isaacs J in
Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners v Hancock.
 First, as stated in (iii)(b)
above, it was only one of three matters relied upon, and was the least sinister
in that the arbitrator
had found that aspect of evidence to be "non
persuasive".  Secondly, the arbitrator was, in effect, restating his finding in
paragraph
32 of the reasons for his decision in the security for costs
application dated 17 December 1996 as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	". . . The evidence about Mews, in the absence of financial statements and
Trust Deed(s) was clouded, however I accept it as the
probable owner of Elspan.
Viva voce evidence of Mr John Ellen that Mews owned no assets was not
persuasive absent supporting documents,
which Mr Williamson said he examined
prior recommending [sic] approval of the HK3.5m loan in November 1991."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Williamson was the Westpac Banking officer called by Elspan.</i>
<P>

<i>	Elspan now seeks to demonstrate that that finding was in error.  It was
incumbent upon Elspan via its legal advisors to have pointed
out that error to
the arbitrator long ago.  As between the parties, it is not just for Elspan to
have allowed it to stand to this
time, and now challenge it as "misconduct"
upon the arbitrator's reapplication of his previous finding that remained
uncorrected.'</i>
<P>

49	Elspan's submission was that both on the basis of procedural fairness and
legal principle, it was necessary that an allegation
of deliberate deceit be
put to any witness specifically before a finding adverse to that witness on
that point could possibly be
made.  In this regard, Elspan cited inter alia
<i>Boston Clothing Co v Margaronis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20580" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 580</a> at 590 A - B where
Kirby P said:
<P>

	<i>`I am inclined to agree with Burke CCJ that the practical rule of fairness
enshrined in the Browne v Dunn principle required that
the suggested
contradictions in the worker's history should have been put to the worker
before they were used as a basis not of challenging
the opinions resting on
them but of challenging the truth of the worker's evidence.  No such challenge
was put to the worker by counsel
for the employer in his economical
cross-examination.  If the Commissioner himself intended to rely upon the
evidence in the way
he did, procedural fairness required that he should have
drawn the suggested inconsistencies which were troubling him to the notice
of
the worker or of counsel.  Then the worker would have the opportunity of
explaining the suggested inconsistencies.  Her counsel
would have had the
chance of calling oral evidence from her medical advisers to supplement the
written opinions which they had provided.
 In the course adopted by the
Commissioner, there was a real risk of injustice to the worker.  Burke CCJ
recognised that risk and
his review dealt with it.'</i>
<P>

50	Elspan's submission was that in the premises, the Arbitrator had committed
legal and/or technical misconduct or alternatively,
that there had been a
breach of procedural fairness.  Elspan submitted that those serious credit
findings for which it is submitted
`there was absolutely no basis', must remain
with the Arbitrator and will have probable impact on his mind in dealing with
the costs
of the Arbitration.
<P>

51	Elspan, although seeking to set aside those parts of the Award referred to
in paragraph 2, ultimately accepted in argument that
those findings on the
credit of Mr John Ellen, impacted on the Arbitrator's mind in making his
interim award insofar as three particular
claims were concerned and insofar as
the Arbitrator's pending decision on costs, not yet argued, were concerned..
The three claims
are :
<P>

	(a)	The claim for additional concrete additives - 	$3,600
<P>

	(b)	The rejection of Mr John Ellen's evidence that the amount of deposit
reflected in the long span lease of the jacking equipment,
a factor leading to
the rejection of the higher claim for jacking -	$78,300
<P>

	(c)	The finding that the Valley Steel invoices relating to awning canopies
where insufficient to find that Elspan either paid for
the canopies or had a
continuing obligation to pay for them -	$4,293
<P>

52	These matters will be referred to below.
<P>

53	As to costs, Elspan submitted that it had a justifiable lack of confidence
in the Arbitrator now determining costs.
<P>

54	It is clear then that Elspan's complaint is that Mr John Ellen was not
cross-examined by counsel for Eurocopter in relation to
specific facts
ultimately found by the Arbitrator and further, that Mr John Ellen was not
given notice by the Arbitrator in relation
to the Arbitrator's finding of
deception about the issue of concrete strengths.
<P>

55	Eurocopter's response to those complaints is as follows:
<P>

	<i>`(i)	John Ellen's credit was very much in issue throughout the entire
arbitration and </i><cite>it was put specifically to him that he was prepared
to deceive the Arbitrator on any issue if he thought it would provide a
forensic
advantage to Elspan</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	There could be no doubt that Elspan's counsel was aware that John
Ellen's credit was under attack on every issue.  Counsel for
Elspan referred to
the credit attack on John Ellen and said that he had been `attacked quite
viciously' .</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The Browne v Dunn point was not taken by Elspan in the Arbitration.'
</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

56	Eurocopter submits that Elspan's complaint in effect is that, as to every
fact in issue involving Mr John Ellen's evidence, and
as to every finding on
credit to be made, each of those matters were required to be specifically put
to Mr John Ellen before a finding
could be made adverse to Elspan.  Eurocopter
submitted and I accept, that that contention is incorrect for a number of
reasons which
include the following:
<P>

	(i) 	The rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> does not apply where the witness is on
notice that his version is in contest.
<P>

	(ii)	That notice may come from the pleadings;  <i>Seymour v ABC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2019%20NSWLR%20219" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 19
NSWLR 219</a> at 224-225 per Glass JA.
<P>

	(iii)	That notice may come from the other side's evidence or the other side's
opening; <i> Browne v Dunn</i> (1894) 6R 67 at 70 (HL).
<P>

	(iv)	That notice may come from the general manner in which the case is
conducted:  <i>Seymour v ABC</i> at 236 per Mahoney JA.
<P>

	(v)	Where there is a general attack on a witness's credit, made known to the
witness, either through pleadings or cross-examination,
counsel is permitted to
argue, and the Court is permitted to make findings, that a witness is
deliberately giving false evidence
without the necessity of putting that to the
witness.  In <i>Thomas v Van Den Yssel</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2014%20SASR%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 14 SASR 205</a> at 207, Bray CJ
said in discussion of the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i>:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>But these principles cannot, in my view, be applied without
qualification to a challenge to a witnesses credit generally</cite><i>,
particularly the credit of a Plaintiff in an action for damages for personal
injuries in relation to his evidence about his symptoms
and incapacities.
Damages are always in issue.  Such a Plaintiff knows that the Defendant will
contend that his injuries do not deserve
the sum which he himself has placed on
them.  And in many other cases the witness must know that the other side will
contend that
he is not telling the truth, and even in some cases that he is
deliberately not telling the truth.  </i><cite>I cannot assent to the
proposition that counsel cannot argue or the Court find that a witness is
deliberately giving false evidence
unless the witness is asked some such
question as "I put it to you that your evidence is false", or "I suggest that
that is a deliberate
lie" or the like</cite><i>.  Indeed a successful objection
might be taken to such evidence as needlessly offensive.'   </i>[Emphasis
added]
<P>

57	I note that in <i>Bulstrode v Trimble</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1970/104.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] VicRp 104</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20VR%20840" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] VR 840</a> Newton J extensively
reviewed the application of the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> and at page 848
his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>`. . . if a witness's evidence . . . was contradicted by other evidence
which appeared worthy of credence, the fact that the witness
had not been
cross-examined would, or might be of little importance in deciding whether to
accept his evidence.'</i>
<P>

58	In <i>Re Brace</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20WLR%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 WLR 595 (CA)</a>, a debtor denied service of a
bankruptcy petition.  The debtor and another person swore affidavits in which
they contended that there
had been no service of the petition.  The creditor
tendered an affidavit of the process server who swore that he had served the
debtor
with the petition.  He was cross-examined about that.  The debtor and
his witness were `present in Court and were tendered for cross-examination'
(page 596);  `. . . the witnesses were there and were offered for
cross-examination';  per Sellers LJ at 597.
<P>

59	Counsel for the creditor did not examine them.
<P>

60	The Registrar found against the debtor.  The debtor appealed on the ground
that the Registrar was not entitled to decide the
question of service without
hearing cross-examination of the debtor and his witness.  The appeal failed.
At page 579 Sellers LJ said:
 `I can see no occasion for cross-examination at
all'.  At page 598, Russell LJ said:
<P>

	<i>`This is not a case in which the debtor was shut out from leading further
or supplementary evidence.  The only complaint is that there
was no
cross-examination of him and his witness, which it is said might have given
them an opportunity (so to speak) to show their
paces.  The point is
hopeless.'</i>
<P>

61	The application of the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> is to be found in
principles enunciated by Mahoney J in <i>Seymour v ABC.  </i>At page 236, his
Honour discussed the principles to be applied where a witness is on notice that
his evidence is in contest.  His
Honour said:
<P>

	<i>`Where in a civil case, a witness is not cross-examined, it may normally be
assumed that the evidence of that witness is not in contest
. . . But the
circumstances of the particular case may negative such an assumption . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Similarly, failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an
assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is
clear from the
manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be
contested . . .  The nature of the
defendant's case and the particulars given,
and otherwise the conduct of it may make it sufficiently clear that such an
assumption
is unwarranted and that there has been no surprise or prejudice
concerning the matter.'</i>
<P>

62	In <i>Seymour</i>, because there was a general contest as to the veracity of
the appellant Seymour, the Court of appeal held that there was no unfairness
where the defendant's counsel sought a finding (but did not put to the
plaintiff in cross-examination), that it was to be inferred
that he was a party
to the fraud, knowingly associated with it and an associate of criminals.
<P>

63	I accept Eurocopter's submission that Elspan and its legal advisers cannot
seriously assert that it was not assumed throughout
the arbitration that the
evidence of Mr Ellen was in contest.  Elspan and its legal advisers were
plainly under no illusion that
Mr John Ellen's evidence was contested in its
entirety.  This is made plain by :
<P>

	(i)	The challenges in the cross-examination of Mr Ellen before the
Arbitrator;
<P>

<i>	</i>(ii)	Eurocopter's express reliance and cross-examination of Mr John
Ellen as to the finding of deception by Mr Samuels QC;
<P>

<i>	</i>(iii)	Eurocopter's written submissions and Elspan's written and oral
submissions in reply before the Arbitrator;
<P>

<i>	</i>(iv)	The fact that Elspan made no submission before the Arbitrator on
<i>Browne v Dunn</i> principles and sought no opportunity to recall witnesses
or deduce further evidence;
<P>

<i>	</i>(v)	The fact that Elspan did not assert injustice to the Arbitrator.
<P>

64	I accept that Elspan's actions left the Arbitrator in no doubt but that he
was to approach the matter upon the assumption that
Mr John Ellen's evidence
was in contest on every issue and as to all aspects of his evidence.  This is
clear from the following material
which was before the Arbitrator:
<P>

	(i)	Mr Samuels QC had recorded the severity of the challenge to Mr John Ellen
by Eurocopter in the second arbitration before him
as follows:  (Page 19.9 of
Mr Samuels' report of 23 July 1993):
<P>

<i>	`Mr McDougall mounted the strongest of attacks upon the credit of each of
them, urging me to disregard their evidence entirely in
the resolution of any
conflict, save for external corroboration and so forth.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(ii)	The challenges in the proceedings before the Arbitrator to be
found in the transcript on 5 July 1997 appended as Appendix `A'
to this
Judgment and in particular page 106 lines 20-30;  page 109 line 28;  page
112-113 and particularly lines 27 on page 112 onwards
where Mr Samuels'
deception finding was put to Mr John Ellen;  page 112 line 34 where the
transcript reads:
<P>

<i>	`Mr Faulkner:  I put it to you Mr Ellen that you are prepared to deceive
the arbitrator on any issue if you think it will provide
a forensic advantage
to Elspan in these proceedings.  That is correct isn't it?';</i>  
<P>

<i>	</i>page 126 lines 23-51;  page 130 line 39-43
<P>

65	Also appended to this Judgment as Appendix `B', are Eurocopter's written
submissions before the Arbitrator - the appendix being
extracts of those
written submissions which speak for themselves.
<P>

66	Appended to this Judgment as Appendix C, are Elspan's written submissions in
reply before the Arbitrator and portions of Elspan's
oral submissions to him.
As will be seen from paragraph 1 of the written submissions, Elspan submitted
that:
<P>

	<i>`Eurocopter's submissions are replete with emotive language such as the
allegation in paragraph 3.4 that Mr John Ellen's evidence
was completely
disingenuous, the allegation in paragraph 3.8 that Elspan had made a special
distinction, the allegation in paragraph
4.2 that Elspan's evidence was
disingenuous and opportunistic, and the allegation in paragraph 10 that it was
characteristics of
Elspan's lack of frankness that preliminaries are still
challenged.'</i>
<P>

67	The oral portion of Mr Jacobs' address before the Arbitrator appearing at
page 245 of the transcript and reproduced in Appendix
`C', includes the
following :
<P>

	<i>`. . . an unfortunate note has been injected in this case.  . . . Not only
has Mr John Ellen been attacked quite viciously, with respect,
and really
without any foundation being laid for such an attack . . .'.</i>
<P>

68	I accept Eurocopter's submission that Elspan is bound by the course which it
adopted at the trial.  In <i>Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal Airports
Corporation</i> (Unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 15 October 1997),
the following passage from <i>University of Wollongong v Metwally (No. 2)</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2059%20ALJR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 59 ALJR 481</a> at 483 was applied:
<P>

	<i>`It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case.  Except
in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary
to all principle to
allow a party, after a case has been decided against him, to raise a new
argument which, whether deliberately
or by inadvertence, he failed to put
during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so.'</i>
<P>

69	In <i>Bulstrode v Trimble</i> at 849, Newton J said:
<P>

	<i>`I know of no case where it has been held that where evidence of a witness
upon a particular matter is allowed to pass without cross-examination,
but
evidence of a substantial character is called by the opposite party in direct
contradiction thereof, the judge or jury is required
in law to accept the
former evidence.  And, in my view, this is plainly not the law.'</i>
<P>

70	Eurocopter submits that as to all issues presently under consideration,
opposing evidence of a substantial character was before
the Arbitrator.  It is
submitted that in each instance, the evidence of Mr John Ellen was elicited to
contradict expert evidence
in an attempt to increase the amounts allowed by the
Joint Report of the two experts who had, of course, included Elspan's expert
witness.  It is submitted that the evidence of Mr John Ellen as a whole was
contested and that it was made quite plain to him and
his counsel that that was
so.  It seems to me that these submissions require to be accepted.
<P>

71	It is important that it is understood that what was in issue was plainly
known to Mr John Ellen and to counsel for Eurocopter
and in particular, that
all matters which are the subject of Elspan's present application were in
issue.  In this regard, Eurocopter
points out the following factors:
<P>

	`<i>.	Elspan and Eurocopter called expert evidence via a quantity surveyor for
each - Mr Horley for Elspan and Mr Moir for Eurocopter.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The experts produced a joint report which Eurocopter accepted in its
entirety.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Elspan did not accept the joint report and through John Ellen's evidence,
sought to challenge the joint report and contend for
higher amounts.  That was
so for the following items:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	Concrete strength;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	Concrete additives;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	Cost of jacking;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	Amount allowed for the `complex works';</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	Amount for preliminaries;</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	Amount for design;</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	Decommissioning of site;</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	Amount for shipping containers.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Elspan persuaded the Arbitrator to allow supplementary questions to be
put to the experts.  Elspan then challenged those supplementary
answers,
including those of their expert Mr Horley.'</i>
<P>

72	In so far as the issues in contest being known to Elspan are concerned, they
were referred to by the Arbitrator in the Award,
paragraph 38, where the
Arbitrator stated that following receipt and consideration of the experts'
joint report `Elspan counter attacked
announcing that it challenged some
significant aspects of the joint report and filed a further late affidavit of
Mr Ellen dated 2
July 1997 . . .'.
<P>

73	Eurocopter points out that as to the matters in the Joint Report which
Elspan contested through Mr John Ellen's evidence, Eurocopter
sought to uphold
the experts' joint report.  Hence, as to each issue, Mr John Ellen and his
counsel were on notice that his version
was in contest.
<P>

74	Eurocopter then submit that the Arbitrator was bound to make his decision
upon the material before him.  The submission is that
in full knowledge of all
issues, the parties had placed before the Arbitrator all evidence that they
wished him to have.  The submission
is that as Newton J in <i>Bulstrode v
Trimble</i> said at 848, the tribunal was `. . . fully entitled to decide the
case upon the evidence which the parties by their legal advisers
chose to place
before him;  indeed this was his primary function'.
<P>

75	As a result of those submissions, Eurocopter puts that there was no
unfairness to Elspan as regards the findings made against
Elspan and against Mr
John Ellen by the Arbitrator.
<P>

76	Elspan then submits that the only error which the Arbitrator made was with
regard to the finding that Mr John Ellen had given
evidence about assets of
Muse.  It is said that this did not amount to misconduct when seen in
context.
<P>

77	I have given close consideration to the respective arguments put in relation
to the Arbitrator's clear error in paragraph 26
of his Award in having stated
that in the security for costs hearing Mr Ellen had given evidence that Muse
owned no assets and that
the Arbitrator found that evidence to be
non-persuasive absent supporting documents.  There is no doubt that the
Arbitrator was in
error in stating that Mr Ellen had given evidence that Muse
had no assets.  As earlier pointed out, Mr John Ellen deposed before
this Court
in paragraph 7.17.4 that he had not given any such evidence.
<P>

78	In the context earlier referred to, in which the credit of Mr John Ellen was
so very plainly at issue as a general matter, it
does not seem to me that the
Arbitrator misconducted himself by finding that Mr Ellen had deliberately
sought to mislead Mr Horley
without that matter having been put to the
plaintiff's counsel or to Mr John Ellen by the Arbitrator during the
proceedings.
<P>

79	In consequence, the question which arises is as to the Arbitrator's error
with respect to the Muse evidence matter.  The Arbitrator
clearly misconducted
himself in that regard.  But to what extent, if any, does his misconduct on
that matter require segments of
the Award to be set aside?
<P>

80	Having given the matter some close consideration and particularly bearing in
mind the fact that the reservations which the Arbitrator
expressed as to Mr
Ellen's credibility in the Award and in particular in paragraph 53 of the Award
[but see also paragraph 51 . .
.] to my mind at the end of the day, fairness
does not dictate that any section of the Award, be set aside on that basis.

<P>

	<b>The Claim for Additional Concrete Additives</b>
<P>

81	The challenge to the Arbitrator's finding in this regard is squarely based
upon the matters already referred to.   I do not accept
that the Arbitrator was
not entitled in the context of this case to find that Mr Ellen had deliberately
sought to mislead Mr Horley
and the Tribunal to Elspan's advantage in an
attempt to increase a sum agreed by the quantity survey.  Whilst it is a close
question
as to whether the Arbitrator's error should permit any section of the
Award to be set aside, it seems to me that the Arbitrator had
an entitlement
resting on more than one basis to express the reservations which he did in
relation to Mr Ellen's credit.  The fact
that the Arbitrator came to an
erroneous finding in relation to the Muse matter does not necessarily mean that
the general credit
findings based on entirely valid considerations, require to
be set aside.  I reject Elspan's claim to set aside any sections of the
report
by reason of the Arbitrator's error with respect to the Muse matter.
<P>

82	I turn now to examine the further particular claims pursued pursuant to
section 42 against the above background.
<P>

	<b>Jacking</b>
<P>

83	Elspan's submission in this regard is as follows:
<P>

	<i>`7.1	In paras.63-69 of "the Award" (Item 50 of the joint report Exhibit"
EXPT) the Second Defendant:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Adopted the quantity surveyor's estimate in an amount of $72,720.00, as
the fair market value of the jacking;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	noted in paragraphs 28 and 63 of his reasons that the Plaintiff had
failed to produce documentary confirmation of or an invoice
from Longspan (a
company in the Elspan group), to the Plaintiff for the leasing charges, or
evidence of payment of the rental under
the lease;  for lifting
equipment;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	held in paragraph 66 that he could refer to items 4 and 5 of Schedule
"D";  see the documents contained in Tab 2 p.58 at 59,
of the second contract
to ascertain what the Plaintiff and the first Defendant allowed for lifting.
In his holding that Schedule
"D";  see the documents contained in Tab 2 p.58 at
59, related to the value of Items of work under the Second Contract, the Second
Defendant overlooked the finding of the Honourable Gordon Samuels QC. on 23
July 1993 that Schedule "D";  see the documents contained
in Tab 2 p.58 at
59,identified stages in the execution of the work when the Superintendent would
be required to certify for payments,
and his own finding in paragraph 4 of his
reasons that Schedule "D";  see the documents contained in Tab 2 p.58 at 59,
recorded payment
stages (milestones for payments).</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	found in para.67 of "the Award" that Schedule "D";  see the documents
contained in Tab 2 p.58 at 59, to the Second Building Contract
dated 5
September 1991, provided in Items 4 and 5 a total amount of $106,000.00 for
lifting, which was less than the amount determined
by the quantity surveyors
ie. $72,720.00 for slab lifting and $7,430.00 for slab raising and concrete
infills (together with a portion
of the preliminaries);</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	found that, "Elspan was seeking (in the second contract) to recover
about $100,000 in total for lifting and slab bracing. "and
this was well below
the amount allowed by the quantity surveyors for direct costs of lifting and
special supervision;</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	found in paragraph 68 that although the quantity surveyors joint report
on the quantum meruit to be allowed for lifting costs
may have been based on an
erroneous interpretation of the "Elspan"/Longspan lease, he was sure that they
had benchmarked their total
allowance for lifting against the cost of form work
for conventionally constructed, suspended post-tensioned slabs and the amounts
in items 4 &amp; 5 of Schedule "D";  (a document that came into existence
during the negotiations leading up to the second building
contract), see the
documents contained in Tab 2 p.58 at 59.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.2	It was not put to Mr. John Ellen either by the Second Defendant or by
First Defendant's counsel in cross-examination that either:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Schedule "D";  see the documents contained in Tab 2 p.58 at 59, to the
second Building Contract was a quantification of the contract
sum;  see
para.7.11.1 of Mr. John Ellen's Founding Affidavit of 18 December 1998, see the
documents contained in Tab 2 pp.57-60;
 and/or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	That Items 4 and 5 thereof represented the contract sum for jacking and
lifting;  see para.7.11.1 of Mr. John Ellen's Founding
Affidavit of 18 December
1998, see the documents contained in Tab 2 pp.57-60.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.3	Had this issue been raised with Mr. John Ellen by the Second Defendant
or in cross-examination by First Defendant's counsel,
the Second Defendant
would have been informed that Schedule "D";  see the documents contained in Tab
2 p.58 at 59, to the Second
Building Contract was a list of milestone payments
and not a list containing the contract values for any items of work;  and
further
that in any event, the items in Schedule "D";  see the documents
contained in Tab 2 p.58 at 59, relating to lifting and jacking were
not
confined to Items 4 and 5, but included Items 2A and 3;  see para.7.11.2 of Mr.
John Ellen's Founding Affidavit of 18 December
1998, see the documents
contained in Tab 2 pp.57-60.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.4	The Second Defendant's holdings in paragraphs 4 on the one hand and in
paragraphs 66, 67, 68;, and 69 on the other, of the interim
award, as to the
function and effect of Schedule "D";  (see the documents contained in Tab 2
p.58 at 59), are contradictory., see
the documents contained in Tab 33
pp.1302-1303.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.5	The fact found by the second Defendant that the Plaintiff did not
produce documentary confirmation of the Plaintiff's obligation
to "Longspan"
for the rental payment under the "Elspan" "Longspan" lease was one of the
factors that impacted on his mind in rejecting
the Plaintiff's claim for the
lifting charges.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.6	This issue was not put to Mr John Ellen by the Second Defendant, nor
was Mr John Ellen cross examined on it by First Defendant's
counsel.  See
paras.7.12.1 and 7.12.2 of Mr. John Ellen's Founding Affidavit of 18 December
1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.7	No opportunity was afforded to the Plaintiff to clear up the
matter.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.8	Nor was this issue, an issue of fact referred to the Second Defendant
in Exhibit "P5" for determination;  for Exhibit "P5" see
the documents
contained in Tab 28 pp.1229-1230.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.9	The assumptions made by the Second Defendant (and which impacted on his
mind in rejecting the Plaintiff's claim for jacking),
in paragraph 68 of the
interim award and as summarized in paragraph 9(1)(d) of the Plaintiff's
contentions in the Plaintiff's Summons,
were not put by the Second Defendant to
the quantity surveyors in conclave or at all.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.10	The Plaintiff was not given an opportunity of refuting or dealing with
them during the arbitration.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.11	In summary, on this issue the Plaintiff alleges that the Second
Defendant inter alia relied on the assessment by the quantity
surveyors in
their joint report of the quantum meruit to be allowed for lifting, in the
knowledge that the quantity surveyors might
have erred in respect of their
interpretation of the terms of the "Elspan/Longspan" Lease, but he discarded
that factor because of
his benchmark assumptions that were neither put to the
quantity surveyors nor Mr. John Ellen.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.12	In the premises, the Plaintiff alleges that the Second Defendant has
committed legal and/or technical misconduct, alternatively
that the Second
Defendant has misconducted the proceedings, and that the Second Defendant's
rejection of the Plaintiff's claim for
jacking should be set aside and the
matter remitted to a new Arbitrator for determination.'</i>
<P>

84	To my mind, Elspan's submissions do not show relevant misconduct by the
Arbitrator.  The Arbitrator's reasoning in paragraphs
28-33 and 55-69 reveals
that he had regard to Items 4 and 5 of Schedule `D' as only one of several
matters to be considered but ultimately
did not apply those items.  The
Arbitrator adopted the quantum agreed jointly by both quantity surveyors - see
particularly the last
sentence of paragraph 67 of the Award.  He adopted the
quantum agreed upon by both quantity surveyor expert witnesses which was based
upon their professional assessments and not upon Schedule `D'.  
<P>

85	Elspan's submissions overlook, it seems to me, an important finding of the
Arbitrator set out in paragraph 32 of the Award. 
Paragraph 32 of the Award was
in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>'32.	Mr Horley, in his 20 June 1997 report, allowed a sum of $220,940 for
preliminaries which included the supervision of jacking.
 In his 26 June 1997
report in reply, Elspan's expert stated:</i>
<P>

<i>	"I note the statement in item 23.3 of the affidavit of John Ellen dated
23/6/97 that, in his opinion, the cost of lifting the roof
and office slabs was
$164,000.00 compared to my assessment of $72,720.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	In my opinion the difference between the two amounts is due to my allowing
the supervisory costs of this process in the preliminaries
section.  This
allowance in preliminaries explains my contention that preliminaries appear
high."'</i>
<P>

86	The preliminaries are of course the indirect costs in the nature of
overheads and may be compared, for example, with items which
are purchased or
materials which are purchased or labour which is paid for directly by way of
the works.  Particularly important
here is the fact, as the Arbitrator
indicates, that Mr Horley had allowed a sum of $220,940 for preliminaries,
which sum included
the supervision of jacking.  Mr Morley, being Elspan's own
expert, stated that Mr John Ellen had allowed the supervisory costs of
the
relevant process in the costs of that process.
<P>

87	In the result, no Section 42 misconduct is shown.  Insofar as Elspan relies
on this item in its section 38 claim, that claim
is without substance.  The
Arbitrator was engaged upon the task of ascertaining as a fact, the reasonable
value of Elspan's lifting
work.  He did so on the evidence.  He made no error.
There is no issue of law.  The issue does not, it seems to me, arise on the
face of the Award.  There is clearly no evidence of error of law, and if,
contrary to my view, an error of law is arguably exposed,
it is neither plain
in the sense of being obvious, nor manifest in the sense that there was little
or no doubt that an error it was.
 This is a factual consideration.
<P>

88	The section 38(5)(b)(ii) claim fails for the same reasons there being no
strong evidence of the making of an error of law.
<P>

	<b>Awning Canopies</b>
<P>

89	Elspan's complaint in relation to awning canopies is as follows:
<P>

	<i>`8.1	In regard to the Plaintiff's claim for the value of awning canopies
(Items 5 &amp; 10 of the Quantity Surveyors' Joint Report),
the Second
Defendant in para.104, held that there was no documentary evidence provided by
the Plaintiff, see the documents contained
in Tab 33 p.1309,</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Confirming the existence of the fabricated canopies;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	That payment had been made for the canopies, and if not;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	That a debt remained owing to Valley Steel;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	What the fate was of the canopies;</i>
<P>

<i>	and that it was within the Plaintiff's power to produce the evidence
referred to in sub-paras.(a)-(d) above.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.2	In para.105, see the documents contained in Tab 34 p.1309, the Second
Defendant held that having regard to the reservations in
respect of Mr. John
Ellen's evidence (and for which see para.53 of the interim award, Tab 33
p.1300, he did not consider that the
Valley Steel invoices annexed to the
affidavit of Mr. John Ellen sworn on 23 June 1997 and marked "M" (Exhibit
"P8"), Tab 17 Annexure
"M", were sufficient proof on the balance of
probabilities that the Plaintiff either paid for the canopies or had a
continuing obligation
to pay for them.  In the premises, he dismissed the
Plaintiff's claim under this heading for the sum of $10,625.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.3	Mr. John Ellen in para.14 of his affidavit sworn 23 June 1997, Exhibit
"P8", see the documents contained in Tab 17, annexed the
Valley Steel invoices
to the Plaintiff for the aforesaid canopies, and stated that these invoices
reflected the cost of the aforesaid
canopies </i><cite>to</cite><i> the
Plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.4	This evidence was neither challenged in cross-examination or in
submissions by the First Defendant, see paras.7.13.1 - 7.13.3
of Mr. John
Ellen's Founding Affidavit of 18 December 1998, see the documents contained in
Tab 17 pp.0746-0747.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.5	At no stage during the Arbitration did the Second Defendant ask Mr.
John Ellen any questions concerning the allegation made by
him in para.14.2 of
his aforesaid affidavit that the invoices annexed to the aforesaid affidavit
reflected the cost to the Plaintiff
of the aforesaid awning canopies.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.6	In the issues of fact which the parties submitted in Exhibit "P5", see
the documents contained in Tab 27 pp.1229-1280, to the
Second Defendant for
determination, the issues concerning these items were as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>		Para.2 "As to Item 5 (awnings) and 10 (work shop crane):</i>
<P>

<i>		(i)	Has Eurocopter paid for them;</i>
<P>

<i>		(ii)	Were they supplied by Elspan to Eurocopter.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.7	The facts forming the basis of the Second Defendant's rejection of this
claim were not issues of fact referred to the Second
Defendant by the parties
for determination.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.8	Notwithstanding the afore going, the Second Defendant rejected this
claim on the basis that the Plaintiff had failed to prove
that it had paid for
the canopies, alternatively that the debt was still owing.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.9	In the premises, the Second Defendant has committed legal and/or
technical misconduct, alternatively the Second Defendant has
misconducted the
proceedings.'</i>
<P>

90	This is another area in respect of which Elspan seeks to revert to the
credit findings related to Mr John Ellen.  That attack
fails.
<P>

91	The exercise upon which the Arbitrator was engaged, was to determine as a
fact the reasonable remuneration for Elspan regarding
the canopies.  That
required the Arbitrator to ascertain if Elspan had in fact done anything for
which it could be recompensed. 
He found that it had not.  To my mind there was
no error.  There is no issue of law raised by this consideration and no error
arises
on the face of the Award.  There is certainly no strong evidence of
error of law. 
<P>

92	I further note in relation to the same matter, that invoices were annexed to
the affidavit of Mr John Ellen before this Court,
sworn on 18 December 1998 at
Tabs 15 and 17.  These were the documents before the Arbitrator.  They are
copies of invoices issued
to Elspan Australia Pty Limited which was not a party
to the Arbitration.  No invoice was issued to Elspan International Limited.
 To
my mind, the evidence adduced before me from Mr John Ellen, took the matter no
further.  No reason was advanced for Elspan's
failure to produce the document
called `guarantee' before the Arbitrator.  The Arbitrator must further be taken
to have been well
aware of the identity and role of Elspan Australia Pty
Limited.
<P>

	<b>Hangar Crane</b>
<P>

93	Elspan's submissions on this topic are as follows:
<P>

	<i>`9.1	In para.111 of "the Award", see the documents contained in Tab 33
p.1310, the Second Defendant held that there was insufficient
evidence to find
on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff either paid for the hangar
crane, or had a continuing obligation
to pay for it.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.2	Furthermore, the question whether or not the Plaintiff had paid for the
hangar crane or incurred liability to make payment was
not submitted to the
Second Defendant for determination, Exhibit "P5", see the documents contained
in Tab 27 pp.1229-1280.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.3	On 27 June 1997, the Second Defendant informed the parties that his
understanding was that the only issues of fact left in contention
were those
marked with a single asterisk in "the joint report.", see para.7.14.1 of Mr.
John Ellen's Founding Affidavit of 18 December
1998, Tab 29
pp.1233-1234.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.4	As there was no indication to the contrary by the Second Defendant at
the time Mr. Ellen's affidavit "P8", Tab 29 pp.1133-1234,
was read, the
Plaintiff's legal representatives were of the view that the First Defendant no
longer contended that the Plaintiff
could not recover for Item 12, referred to
in the Quantity Surveyor's Joint Report, Exhibit "EXPT1" in Tab 24
pp.1199-1212, (ie.
The hangar crane) and that the only issue that remained in
contention on this aspect was whether that the First Defendant or Aerospatiale
had already paid for it, see paragraph 7.13.2 Tab 17 pp 746-747, as read with
the documents in Tab 29 pp.1133-11234 and para 7.15.1,
Tab 17 pp 746 and
1124-1131.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.5	The sole factual issues submitted for determination by the parties to
the Second Defendant in regard to the hangar crane Item
12, were set out in
para.4 of the List of Joint Issues, Exhibit "P5", see the documents contained
in Tab 27 pp.1229-1280, viz:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Has Eurocopter paid for them (sic) the crane;  (emphasis added)
[</i><cite>not the Plaintiff</cite>
<P>

<i>	(b)	They (sic) (the hangar crane) supplied by Elspan to Eurocopter.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.6	It was against this background that paragraph 14.8 of Mr. Ellen's
affidavit "P8", see the documents contained in Tab 17 p.746
was not
read.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.7	Notwithstanding the agreement reached in para.4 of Exhibit "P5", as
with the the (sic) documents contained in Tab 27 pp.1229-1280,
the Second
Defendant rejected the Plaintiff's claim of $14,343.28 on issues of fact not
submitted to him for determination ie </i><cite>that set out in paragraph 9.7
above</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.8	In paragraph 109 of the Second Defendant's interim award, Tab 33 p.1310
the Second Defendant noted that it was common ground
that the Hangar Crane was
not delivered on site.  In note 1 of Table 2, see the documents contained in
Tab 33 p.1313, the Second
Defendant recorded that the aforesaid crane was not
supplied.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.9	In paragraph 110 of the interim award, the Second Defendant recorded
that there was evidence that the Hangar Crane had been manufactured
off site,
Tab 33 p.1310.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.10	the finding by the Second Defendant in paragraph 109 of the interim
award, Tab 33 p.1310, and in note 1 to Table 2, see the
documents contained in
Tab 33 p.1313, that the Hangar Crane was either not delivered to the site or
"supplied", appears to have impacted
on the Second Defendant's mind in
rejecting the Plaintiff's claim for a quantum meruit under this heading.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.11	In those findings he overlooked:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the recordal in Schedule "D";  Tab 2 p.58 at 59, that it was certified
(by the Superintendent) that the crane had been ordered
by Elspan;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The finding by the first Arbitration that the Superintendent's
certification was correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.12	But the non delivery to the site or the non "supply" do not appear in
the Second Defendant's reasons for the rejection of this
claim.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.13	In the premises, the Plaintiff alleges that the Second Defendant has
committed legal and/or technical misconduct, in the alternative
the Second
Defendant has misconducted the arbitration.'</i>
<P>

94	In effect, Elspan's submissions contend that no issue was live as to whether
Elspan had a liability to pay.  I accept Eurocopter's
submission that it was
Elspan who opened this topic in its final submissions in reply (paragraph
5.3.1) before the Arbitrator by
asserting that Elspan had `incurred a liability
of $14,343.28 in respect of the hangar roof crane'.  Elspan had made that
submission
to the Arbitrator based upon `restitution' [see paragraph 99 of the
Award].  Elspan's counsel had relied on an authority where the
claimant had
expended money and had successfully sought restitution.  I accept Eurocopter's
submission that an issue was therefore
open as to whether the plaintiff had
expended money on the hangar crane, thus giving it an entitlement based on
restitution.  The
Arbitrator was obliged to deal with that issue on the
evidence before him.
<P>

95	I accept Eurocopter's submission that the Arbitrator considered carefully
the submission on restitution [Award paragraphs 99-102],
including as to the
hangar crane [paragraph 102].  The Arbitrator found that there was no evidence
that Elspan had either paid for
the crane or had a continuing obligation to pay
for it  [paragraph 111].  He was searching for `evidence of an expense
incurred'
[paragraph 100].  He found in effect that nothing had occurred upon
which to found an entitlement in quantum meruit.
<P>

96	Elspan's present assertion [Submissions paragraph 9.3-9.6] that Elspan's
advisers did not read paragraph 14.8 of Mr John Ellen's
affidavit because of
their interpretation of what matters remained in dispute, following comments by
the Arbitrator on 27 June 1998,
does not seem to take into account the fact
that Elspan's counsel sought to read paragraph 14.8 of Mr John Ellen's
affidavit in final
submissions but the Arbitrator refused to permit it on the
grounds that this would be unfair to Eurocopter unless it was able to
cross-examine on the orders and invoices referred to in Mr Ellen's paragraph
14.8, which are not in evidence..  [See paragraph 110
of the Award]
<P>

97	I further accept Eurocopter's submission that it is not correct to submit
[see Elspan's submissions paragraph 9.4] that the only
issue remaining as to
the hangar crane was as to whether Eurocopter or Aerospatiale had paid for it.
Item 2 in Exhibit P5 as regards
awnings and hangar crane, was described as :
<P>

	(i)	Has Eurocopter paid for them?
<P>

<i>	</i>(ii)	Were they supplied by Elspan to Eurocopter?
<P>

98	No error of law, no strong evidence of any such error of law and no
misconduct has been shown with respect to the hangar crane
issue.
<P>

	<b>Steel Doors</b>
<P>

99	Elspan's Submissions in this respect are as follows:
<P>

	<i>'10.1	In para.123 of the interim award, see the documents contained in Tab
33 p.1312, the Second Defendant rejected the Plaintiff's
claim for the
difference between $21,752.00 being the amount which the Plaintiff claimed for
steel doors (Item 55 of the joint report)
and the amount of $5,770.00 made up
of the items listed by the Second Defendant in para.122 of his award viz
$15,982.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.2	the Second Defendant in para. 123 of the interim award, see the
documents contained in Tab 33 p.1312, gave as his reason for
rejecting the
claim of $15,982.00 that there was no documentary evidence confirming the fate
of the remaining doors, payment by the
Plaintiff or that a debt remained
owing.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.3	The Second Defendant also held that the evidence was insufficient to
find on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff either
paid for the
remaining doors or had a continuing obligation to pay for them.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.4	In para.14.19 of Mr. John Ellen's affidavit sworn on 23 June 1997,
Exhibit "P8", Tab 17 p.744 at 746, and the invoices annexed
to that affidavit
marked "L", Mr. John Ellen alleged that the cost to the Plaintiff of the
aforesaid doors was in the amount as claimed.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.5	This evidence was not challenged in cross-examination, see para.7.15.1
of Mr. John Ellen's Founding Affidavit sworn 18 December
1998 together with the
material contained in Tab 17 pp.746 and 1124-1131.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.6	The Second Defendant at no stage challenged the authenticity of the
invoices, Annexure "L" to Mr. John Ellen's affidavit of
23 June 1997, Exhibit
"P8", or put to Mr Ellen that the Plaintiff did not have any liability for
payment of the amounts reflected
therein, see para.7.15.1 of Mr. John Ellen's
Founding Affidavit sworn 18 December 1998 together with the material contained
in Tab
17 pp.746 and 1124-1131.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.7	The question whether the Plaintiff paid for the remaining doors or had
a continuing obligation to pay for them was in any event
not one of the issues
of fact put to the Second Defendant in Exhibit "P5", for the Second Defendant's
determination, see the documents
contained in Tab 27 pp.1229-1281.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.8	In the premises, the Plaintiff submits that the Second Defendant has
committed legal and/or technical misconduct or alternatively
misconducted the
proceedings by :</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Deciding this issue against the Plaintiff when there was no challenge
to Mr. John Ellen's affidavit in para.14.19 of his affidavit
of 23 June 1997
Exhibit "P8" and the invoices attached thereto marked "L".</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	not providing an opportunity to the Plaintiff to deal with the Second
Defendant's reservation concerning the question whether
the Plaintiff paid for
the remaining doors or had a continuing obligation to pay for them;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	by deciding this issue on a question not submitted by the parties to
him for determination.'</i>
<P>

100	The exercise upon which the Arbitrator was engaged was to determine as a
fact, reasonable remuneration for Elspan regarding
the steel doors.  That
required the Arbitrator to ascertain if Elspan had in fact done anything for
which it ought to be recompensed.
 He found that it had in the sum of $5,770.
There is, therefore, no error.  There is no misconduct.  In fact the Arbitrator
proceeded
correctly on the assumption that Eurocopter had not paid for the
subject doors and had stated that he could not determine `the fate
of the
remaining doors and that he could not find that Elspan either paid for the
remaining doors or had a continuing obligation
to pay for them'.  Contrary to
what Elspan now submits, that finding was in answer to Exhibit P5 Issues of
fact, item 4 - as to whether
the doors were supplied by Elspan to Eurocopter.
Eurocopter, it seems to me, is correct in its submission that it was not an
answer
to item 4(i) as to whether Eurocopter had paid for them [see the
Arbitrator's Award paragraphs 117-123].  See also the similar logic
adopted by
the Arbitrator in his Award as to the hangar crane (paragraphs 109-112) and the
awning canopies (paragraph 103-105).
<P>

101	It is clear, considering the whole of the relevant parts of the
Arbitrator's Award, that he had determined this issue (contrary
to Elspan's
present contention) on the basis that the doors were not supplied and that
Elspan was unable to establish that it had
provided anything to Eurocopter
which was of value in the context of quantum meruit beyond the items that he
expressly found were
delivered and which he allowed in full at $5,770.  Elspan
was therefore unable to establish that it had incurred any obligation upon
which to found an entitlement to quantum meruit for the balance.
<P>

102	No misconduct is shown, no error of law is shown and no strong evidence of
an error of law is shown.
<P>

	<b>Failure to deal with Items </b>
<P>

103	This is a matter which is dealt with only in Elspan's Section 38 case.  The
submissions here are as follows:
<P>

	<i>`6.1	The following issues were referred by agreement between the parties to
the Arbitrator for determination in Ex. "P5", Tab 28 pp.01229-01230:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Item 17 - Plans of steel building and concrete building:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	did Elspan prepare and provide drawings (is Eurocopter in possession of
the drawings);</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	if so, is Elspan entitled to the sum of $30,000.00 or some other sum
for these drawings;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Scrap:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	was Elspan paid by Eurocopter for the steel building;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	if not, has the scrap been utilised and does Eurocopter owe Elspan a
sum for it.  If so, what amount?</i>
<P>

<i>	6.2	The Arbitrator in "the Award" failed to deal with either of the issues
referred to above.'</i>
<P>

104	To my mind, Eurocopter's submissions in this regard require to be accepted.
They were that Elspan had established, through cross-examination
of Mr Stone,
that Eurocopter had taken and copied some drawings.  Neither party had sought
to adduce any evidence of the value of
the drawings and the experts were not
asked questions about them.  I accept that it should be assumed that Elspan
chose not to open
the issue with its expert, bearing in mind that the experts
were asked, and did provide, evidence (design fee of 7.4%) as to the
value of
other drawings.  The design fee issue is dealt with below.
<P>

105	Eurocopter submitted and I accept, that except for Elspan establishing
through cross-examination of Mr Stone that Eurocopter
had taken and copied some
drawings, nothing further was said in the proceedings about the issue.  Neither
Elspan nor Eurocopter mentioned
the claim in their respective submissions.  Mr
Jacobs QC submitted that this was incorrect and that in his submissions below
at paragraph
5.5, that matter was raised.  This is incorrect as it seems to me,
when one examines that paragraph as it is in the middle of a heading
entitled
`Design Fee'.  See generally the structure of Elspan's submissions below, where
for example paragraph 3.5 dealt with the
awning canopy;  paragraph 3.6 dealt
with the hangar;  paragraph 3.8 dealt with equipment supply;  paragraph 5 dealt
with the design
fee;  paragraph 6 dealt with lifting and so on.  Paragraphs 5.5
and 5.6 make plain that the submissions below dealt with only the
design fee
claim.
<P>

106	The Arbitrator was, it seems to me, entitled to assume that the issue was
abandoned.  Plainly, the Court may have regard to
evidence as to how the case
was presented - see Brownie J in <i>Graham Evans &amp; Co Pty Ltd v EPF
Formwork Pty Ltd</i> (1992) 8 BCL 147 at 149 per Brownie J.  No error of law on
the face of the award is established.  See generally <i>Horizons Corporation
Pty Ltd v Lahey Constructions Pty Ltd</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of New
South Wales, Einstein J, 27 November 1998) dealing with the entitlement of the
Court to take into
account the manner in which the Arbitration was conducted,
when an issue of this nature arises.
<P>

	<b>Design Fee</b>
<P>

107	The complaint pleaded pursuant to the Section 42 claim in this regard is as
follows:
<P>

	<i>'15.1	In Table 2 of the Award, the Second Defendant determined the quantum
meruit to be allowed for the design fee at 7.4% of the
quantum meruit of
$558,542.00, in an amount of $41,332.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.2.1	Mr Horley when questioned by counsel for the Plaintiff stated that
he calculated the design fee in an amount of $62,700 on
a contract value of
$910,000.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.2.2	and stated that both he and Eurocopter's expert were agreed in this
respect (see T/R 15 lines 43-54 and T/R 16- 1 - 40 of
27 June 1997).</i>
<P>

<i>	15.2.3	In response to a question from the Arbitrator at T/r 27 June 1997 (p
7 lines 36-45), Mr Horley stated that the design fee
should be calculated on
7.4% of the net value of the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.3	The Arbitrator in his additional reasons dated 4 November 1998
referred to cross-examination of Mr Horley by Mr Woods as a basis
for
concluding that the 7.4% should be applied to the sum of $581,892.00, without
referring to the uncontradicted evidence above.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.4	In so doing, the Arbitrator ignored the uncontradicted evidence of the
agreement between the two experts and also the answer
given to the Arbitrator
by Mr Horley.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.1	In paragraph 45 of his reasons, the Arbitrator stated that the
aforesaid amount of 7.4% should be calculated on the net value
of the work
undertaken by the Plaintiff under the "second contract."</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.2	In the Arbitrator's calculations of the quantum meruit at p 25 of
his reasons he allowed 7.4% of the quantum meruit, and not
the value of the
work undertaken under the second contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.3	Therefore, there is a conflict in the award, which the Arbitrator's
additional reasons of 4 November fail to clear up.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.4	Mr Horley stated in evidence that the figure of 7.4%, was given to
him by Mr Moir.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.5	The Arbitrator's determination of the quantum meruit for the design
fee was based upon his acceptance of Mr Horley's evidence
as to the percentage
of 7.4% to be applied.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.6	Mr Moir stated that the percentage of 7.4% had been given by him by
Mr. Stone as the allowance built into the "first contract"
for design.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.5.7	In therefore accepting the percentage of 7.4% as the basis for his
determination of the quantum meruit for the design fee,
the Arbitrator ignored
the evidence that this percentage was based on a statement by Mr Stone to Mr
Moir as the sum built into the
"first contract" as a design fee.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.6	In the premises, the Second Defendant has committed legal and/or
technical misconduct, alternatively has misconducted the proceedings.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Amended Summons 55047/98]
<P>

108	To my mind, the exercise upon which the Arbitrator was engaged was clearly
to determine, as a question of fact, the reasonable
remuneration for such
design work as had been undertaken at the date of repudiation and termination.
As to that question of fact,
the Arbitrator accepted the joint evidence of the
experts.  He was not bound to adopt another course.  The question, it seems to
me, is one of fact alone.  It does not appear to me that there has been any
error shown.  It does not appear to me that there has
been any misconduct of
the Arbitrator shown.
<P>

109	One has to approach the exercise by considering that in paragraph 42 to 45
of the Award, the Arbitrator accepted that for the
provision of full design
services for the complete work involved in the second contract, the figure of
7.4% would be appropriate
for the design element within the second contract
lump sum of $910,400 pursuant to clause 3.6 of the second contract.
<P>

110	In paragraph 43, the Arbitrator observed that `it seems clear that the
majority of design work, including that for the remaining
works, was undertaken
during the original agreement', (that is during the work done on the first
contract).
<P>

111	In paragraph 42, the Arbitrator observed the time records relating to Mr
Peter Ellen's design of the second contract were not
produced and that the
design work described by Mr Peter Ellen in relation to the second contract
could be described as relatively
minor.
<P>

112	It seems clear then that the Arbitrator in paragraph 44 for those reasons
determined that the most satisfactory method of determining
a design fee for
such of the second contract works was by reference to that proportion of the
work that had been undertaken at the
date of repudiation, thereby recognising
that some design work would remain not done at the time of termination.  Hence,
the design
fee was allowed on the value of the work as assessed by the experts
as having been performed by Elspan under the second contract.
<P>

113	Eurocopter submitted that 7.4% of the value of the work done at the date of
termination ($558,542 - see Table 2 page 25 of the
Award), was a reasonable
method of determining value of design work carried out by Elspan.  I accept
that submission as correct.
 Both experts agreed as to the appropriateness of
that calculation.  Eurocopter pointed out that reading paragraphs 42 to 45 of
the
Award, it is clear beyond argument that 7.4% of $558,542 was very generous
as a design fee in relation to the second contract for
work actually done,
because most of that design work was in fact done under the first contract.
Eurocopter points out that counsel
for Elspan never specifically challenged the
statement on page 3 of the experts' Joint Report which stated:
<P>

	<i>`In relation to design we note that 7.4% of the net cost of the works is
allowed for design fees in the first contract.'</i>
<P>

114	Finally, Eurocopter submitted that during the examination of the quantity
surveyors during the conclave on 27 June 1997, senior
counsel for Elspan
elicited a response from his client's expert witness, Mr Horley, to the effect
that the appropriate method of
determining the design fee in the present
circumstances was 7.4% of the `net construction costs of the work',  (T 16(8))
following
Mr Horley's answer at T14(1-40) that the appropriate value for the
present project was 7.4% of $581,892.  Eurocopter submitted that
the following
examination by counsel for Elspan of both experts on that day and the later
opportunity to seek supplementary evidence
from them, elicited no further
specific enquiry from counsel for Elspan who did not put to either of the
experts the specific proposition
presently contended for, namely that the 7.4%
should be based upon the second contract value as a whole, rather than upon a
value
which took into account that all the design work had not been
completed.
<P>

115	To my mind, the suggestion that there is a conflict in the Award and that
it was inappropriate for the Arbitrator to proceed
by allowing for the design
fee at 7.4% of the quantum meruit allowed, does not expose any error and does
not expose any misconduct
by the Arbitrator.
<P>

116	The important point to bear in mind is that the Arbitrator had to determine
what design fee should be allowed in a circumstance
where there was an issue as
to how much design work had been undertaken at the date of repudiation and
termination.  The amount of
design fee could only be assessed if one was able
to work out how much design work had been carried out.  The Arbitrator elected
as a factual matter, to determine the reasonable remuneration for the design
work as had been undertaken.  He was entitled to apply
the 7.4% to the quantum
meruit and not to the value of the work undertaken under the contract.  It
cannot be said that he overlooked
the fact that the design responsibility for
the work covered by the second building contract was for its entirety and not
merely
for the work done up to the stage of its unlawful termination.
<P>

	<b>Special Detriment</b>
<P>

117	Elspan's submissions as part of its section 42 challenge in relation to
this issue were as follows:
<P>

	<i>'12.1	In paragraph 139 of the Award, Tab 33 p1317, the Second Defendant
gave as one of his reasons for rejecting the Plaintiff's claim
for special
detriment, (i.e. the amount of interest due to Westpac, Hong Kong, in respect
of the back to back facility provided by
Westpac, Hong Kong for the funding of
the second contract), that the Plaintiff did not produce direct evidence that
there was any
indebtedness by the Plaintiff to Westpac at the date of the
arbitration.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.2	In Mr Andrew Williamson's affidavit, "Ex.A8" paragraph 8, Tab 12 page
576 and page 666-668 it is stated that as the Plaintiff
failed to repay the
capital and interest under the Westpac loan, additional interest had been
incurred.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.3	There was no cross-examination of Mr Andrew Williamson, Mr John and/or
Mr Peter Ellen on this question, see paras. 7.16.1 and
7.16.2 of Mr John
Ellen's affidavit of 18 December 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.4	It was impermissible for the Second Defendant to have come to the
conclusion to which he did, which was in breach of the principles
of procedural
fairness / natural justice.'</i>
<P>

118	Elspan also claimed compound interest as part of the Section 38 challenge
and in this regard, Elspan's submission are as follows:
<P>

	<i>`8.	Compound Interest</i>
<P>

<i>	8.1	The relevant facts are :</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Schedule "D" to the second contract required Eurocopter to set up an
irrevocable documentary letter of credit for the entire
contract sum.  The
whole tenor of Schedule "D" is that timely payment was of critical importance
to Elspan;  Tab 4,p 57-58.</i>
<P>

<i>	At the very least, Eurocopter knew that Elspan could not fund the
construction costs itself and that Elspan was financed by a Westpac
bank
loan.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Westpac Banking Corporation provided Elspan with a loan facility in
November 1991 in an amount of HK$3.5 million, secured by
a mortgage over a
separate cash deposit account into which payments were made on behalf of
Aerospatiale on the Bankstown project
through a letter of credit established by
that company with the French bank, Credit Lyonnaise, in Sydney.  The purpose of
the loan
was to provide Elspan with working capital and to cover any gaps in
project payment receipts (Mr Andrew Williamson, para,2, 16 December
1993); Tab
12, p.574.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	In January 1992, after commencement of the second contract, the Elspan
loan facility was extended by a further amount of HK$1.2
million (para.5,
Williamson);Tab12,p. 574.</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	The interest rate payable under the loan facility was 1.5% above the
lender's prime lending rate from time to time.  See clause
6(a) of the Loan
Agreement attached to Mr Williamson's affidavit.  The interest rates charged
from 5 November 1991 - 29 October 1993
appear from Exhibit "L" to Mr
Williamson's affidavit sworn 16 December 1993, Tab 12, pp.663-665.</i>
<P>

<i>	Interest accrued up to 31 March 1993 and was in an amount of HK$25,041.17.
See page 126 of Mr Williamson's affidavit, at Tab 12,
p.665.</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	The terms of the loan with Westpac provided for the application of the
milestone payments to be paid by Eurocopter through Credit
Lyonnais [sic]
directly to Westpac, whereupon the monies were to be applied to the reduction
of the principal and interest of the
loan.  (Mr Peter Ellen, para.19, 21 June
1996);  Tab 10, p.231.</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	Provided the milestone payments were made and the contract went to
completion, the loan from Westpac would be fully discharged.
 (Para.20, Mr
Peter Ellen's affidavit);  Tab 10, p 231.</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)	Because Eurocopter was intimately involved in the negotiations leading
to the establishment of schedule "D" and "E" of the contract
and the provisions
of security for the loan, it knew that by repudiating the contract and
preventing Elspan from completing the contract,
Elspan would be placed at
immediate risk of default under the loan.  (Mr Peter Ellen, para.22);  Tab 10,
p.231.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.2	Elspan is liable to pay Westpac compound interest on either the amount
of $3.5 million or $1.2 million and that has been brought
about by Eurocopter's
wrongful repudiation.  Elspan has therefore suffered this "real detriment" and
is entitled to be compensated
in that amount on that basis, irrespective of
whether or not the </i><cite>Hungerfords</cite><i> principles referred to below
apply.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.3	Alternatively, Elspan contends that it is entitled to compound interest
on the amount of the quantum meruit awarded by the Arbitrator.
 It is stressed
that this is not to be confused with the claim for compound interest by way of
a "real detriment" referred to above.
 The two claims are juristically
distinct, although if Elspan is awarded the former, it cannot get the latter as
there would be an
overlap.</i>

- the House of Lords, by a bare majority held that compound interest could not
be claimed in a claim for unjust enrichment.  There
appears to be no Australian
authority one way or the other as to whether or not compound interest as
compensation can be awarded
in a quantum meruit claim.  Santow J in
</i><cite>Budget Stationery Supplies Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank
</cite><i>(unreported, Sup Ct NSW 25 September 1996) considered this issue in
obiter dicta as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	"The final question, even if these hurdles were cleared, is what basis of
interest (simple at common law or compound in equity) would
be recoverable by
way of common law restitution.  I refer here to the decision of the House of
Lords in </i><cite>Westdeutsche Landesbank Cirozentrale [sic] v Islington
London Borough Council </cite><i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20WLR%20802" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 WLR 802</a> denying compound interest,
through by bare majority.  Lord Goff (at 817B) in dissent concluded that
compound interest should have
been awarded, relying inter alia upon
</i><cite>Hungerfords v Walker</cite><i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20171%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 171 CLR 125</a> at 148.  However in
light of my earlier conclusions I do not need to deal with that difficult
question."</i>
<P>

<i>	Lord Goff held as follows in </i><cite>Girozentrale</cite><i> at <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20AllER%20961" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2
All.ER 961</a> @ 976 d-f:</i>
<P>

<i>	"With great respect I myself consider that, if the jurisdiction to award
compound interest is available where justice so demands,
it cannot be so
confined as to exclude any class of case simply because that class of case has
not previously been recognised as
falling within it.  I prefer therefore to
read the passage quoted from Lord Brandon's speech as Mason CJ. And [sic]
Wilson J. read
in </i><cite>Hungerfords v Walker</cite><i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20171%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 171 CLR 125</a>
at 148, as providing examples (ie not exclusive examples) of the application of
the underlying principle of justice."</i>
<P>

<i>	Lord Goff was clearly of the view that had he been free to follow the High
Court in </i><cite>Hungerfords</cite><i>, he would have awarded interest at
compound rates.</i>
<P>

<i>	The tenor of Santow J's judgment was that if His Honour were to have
decided the </i><cite>Girozentrale</cite><i> case, His Honour would have agreed
with Lord Goff, whose powerful dissent, based as it was on the High Court's
decision in </i><cite>Hungerfords</cite><i>, is a very persuasive indicator of
how an Australian court would decide if faced with the matter.  Accordingly, it
is submitted that
there is strong evidence of an error of law on the face of
the Award.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is to be emphasised that compound interest as compensation is claimed in
this arbitration first as compensation for the "real
detriment" that Elspan has
suffered, i.e. the compound interest which it is contractually obliged to pay
Westpac;  alternatively
compound interest on the amount of the quantum meruit
awarded by the Arbitrator.</i>
<P>

<i>	An analysis of the case shows that when interest by way of damages became
allowable in England, the plaintiff in order to be successful,
was required to
show that the damages claimed fell within the "second limb" in </i><cite>Hadley
v Baxendale</cite><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281854%29%209%20Exch%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1854) 9 EX 341</a>, viz. that the defendant had actual
knowledge at the time that the contract was concluded of the circumstances that
would give rise
to the loss on wrongful repudiation.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.7	The majority in </i><cite>Hungerfords</cite><i> swept away the
distinction between the first and the second limb in </i><cite>Hadley v
Baxendale</cite><i> and held that it was not necessary to establish actual
knowledge of the loss that would be sustained upon breach, at the time the
contract was executed.  Although it is submitted that on the probabilities,
because of the special deal struck with Westpac, with
Eurocopter's knowledge,
Eurocopter knew that Elspan would have had to be paid by Eurocopter in order to
enable Elspan to discharge
the special loan taken from Westpac to complete the
Bankstown project, proof of actual knowledge by Eurocopter is not required. 
In
any event, as Giles J observed in </i><cite>Multiplex Constructions v Abgarus
Pty Limited</cite><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 504</a> at 521G, (dealing with presumed
intention in this day and age) parties to a construction contract know that "at
the date of contract
... delay in achieving practical completion will
necessarily result in additional holding costs.  Such damages ... fall within
the
first rule in </i><cite>Hadley v Baxendale</cite><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281854%29%209%20Exch%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1854) 9 Ex 341.</a> . . .
 In other words, such losses flow naturally from a breach, in the ordinary
course of things".'</i>
<P>

119	To my mind, Elspan's claims are simply answered.  The Arbitrator accepted
the proposition that Elspan had an arguable legal
entitlement to claim special
detriment `if a real detriment can be identified' - see Award paragraph 134.
The Arbitrator then proceeded
to examine the evidence to ascertain if Elspan
had shown that there had been a `special detriment' as alleged and at paragraph
141
he held as a factual matter that he was unable to identify any special
detriment related to interest on the Hong Kong loans.  Earlier
he had, in
paragraph 139, referred to the doubt as to whether or not Westpac had written
off the balances of the two Hong Kong loans
and had stated that if the loans
were current at the time of the hearing and later, it would have been in
Elspan's power to produce
direct evidence to that effect, but that it had not.

<P>

120	To my mind, Elspan's special detriment claims require to be rejected.  It
was open to the Arbitrator to find as he did.  The
finding of fact that the
Arbitrator was unable to identify any special detriment relating to interest on
the Hong Kong loans if they
still existed at paragraph 141, does not indicate
manifest error on the face of the Award nor misconduct by the Arbitrator.  The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(ii)</a> claim is rejected.
<P>

121	There is no doubt but that the question of whether or not compound interest
may be claimed in a claim for unjust enrichment
is a difficult question.  I do
not see that it is necessary for that question to be decided here.
<P>

	<b>Decommissioning Costs</b>
<P>

122	Elspan's submissions pursued pursuant to its <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38</a> case, in relation
to this matter are as follows:
<P>

	<i>`1.1	In paragraph 41 of the Arbitrator's interim award of 14 October 1998
Tab.33 p.01298, the Arbitrator held that because of the
provisions of Clause
14.5 of the "Second Building Contract" dated 5 September 1991, Tab.2 p.31, the
Plaintiff was precluded from
claiming on a quantum meruit for decommissioning
the building site.</i>
<P>

<i>	1.2	As a consequence of the repudiation of the Building Contract by the
Defendant, the Plaintiff was compelled at a premature stage
to decommission the
site and incur expenses in so doing.</i>
<P>

<i>	1.3	The incurring of such expenses constituted a real "detriment" or
material damage sustained by the Plaintiff;  </i><cite>Jennings Construction
Ltd. v Q.H.&amp;.M. Birt Pty. Limited</cite><i> (unreported Sup.Ct. NSW 16
December 1988) per Cole J. (as he then was);  in circumstances where these were
incurred before the Plaintiff
could recoup its contractual benefit (the
contract price) and an amount representing such real "detriment" or material
damage is
recoverable by way of a quantum meruit.</i>
<P>

<i>	1.4	Alternatively and in any event the contractual terms of the repudiated
agreement insofar as they relate to the entitlement of
the innocent party are
not determinative of a quantum meruit;  </i><cite>Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty.
Limited v Paul</cite><i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 221.</a></i>
<P>

123	Clause 14.5 of the second agreement read as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Following termination, completion or suspension of the Remaining Works the
Owner shall give Elspan access to the Site for the purpose
of removing its
temporary buildings, plan, tools, equipment, goods, materials and things
("Equipment") the property of Elspan and
Elspan agrees not to interfere with or
disrupt work being undertaken by contractors employed by the Owner.  Elspan
shall remove the
equipment within 14 days of the termination, completion or
suspension.  Elspan shall make no claim upon the owner for costs incurred
by it
in removing its Equipment . . .'</i>.
<P>

124	J.W. Carter `Breach of Contract', Second Edition, Law Book Company Limited,
1991, examines the extent to which contractual terms
continue to operate after
a termination of performance for breach or repudiation  [paragraphs 1224
through to 1262].  As the author
makes plain, a contractual term intended to
operate after termination may or may not create a primary contractual duty.
Irrespective
of the nature of the term, whether or not the term operates after
termination depends on the intention of the parties.  It is more
difficult to
establish an intention that the term is to operate where the term creates a
primary legal duty.  However, `there is
no rule to the effect that the mere
fact of breach prevents reliance on a term, otherwise intended to operate after
termination'.
 [Paragraph 1260]
<P>

125	At paragraph 1224 the author, in examining the extent to which contractual
terms continue to operate after a termination of
performance for breach or
repudiation, draws the distinction between `terms which create primary
contractual duties in the sense
that their breach gives rise to a liability in
damages', and `terms which regulate the rights and liabilities of the parties
without
creating any primary contractual duties'.  That distinction is
significant because of the general rule that termination for breach
or
repudiation discharges both parties from the obligation to perform their
contractual duties.
<P>

126	At paragraph 1232, the author points out that the general principle at
common law is that the operation of exclusion clauses,
whatever their nature,
depends upon the construction of the contract.
<P>

127	To my mind, no error of law and certainly no manifest error of law has been
demonstrated by the Arbitrator's decision in Award
paragraphs 38 to 41.  The
holding was that Eurocopter was entitled to rely upon contract clause 14.5 as
applying to the parties rights
on termination.  In<i> Van Der Sterren (H&amp;E)
v Cibernetics (Holdings) Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2044%20ALJR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 44 ALJR 157</a>, the High Court
accepted that a clause limiting the time within which the plaintiff was to
notify defects in goods was a clause available
to the defendant, even if it had
committed a breach justifying termination.  In <i>Life Savers (Australasia) Ltd
v Frigmobile Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 431</a>, Hutley JA at 434-435
dealt with circumstances in which exception clauses should be left to operate
according to their terms.  His
Honour cited <i>H &amp; E Van Derran </i> per
Walsh J at 434.  Walsh J had said at 158:  `The terms of exception clauses must
sometimes be read down if they cannot be applied
literally without creating an
absurdity or defeating the main object of the contract'.  As Hutley JA pointed
out, similar language
had been used by Barwick CJ in <i>Port Jackson
Stevedoring Pty v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1912/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20139%20CLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 139 CLR
231</a> at 238.  His Honour could see no bar to the Court, following <i>Photo
Production</i> <i>Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20827" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 827.</a>
<P>

128	There was no manifest error of law in my view, to be found in the
Arbitrator's holding in relation to decommissioning costs.
<P>

129	In any event, Eurocopter's submissions made plain that the quantity
surveyor experts for both parties had jointly allowed (in
`preliminaries') a
sum for progressive cleaning up.
<P>

130	Eurocopter pointed out that the experts had not been examined about quantum
for `decommissioning'.  Eurocopter pointed out that
at paragraph 75 of his
Award, the Arbitrator disallowed a claim for $65,000 for `start up' costs on
the basis that such claim and
quantum were not put to either quantity surveyor
and that the quantity surveyors were ` . . . correct in not treating start up
costs
separately given their approach to costing the preliminaries'.
<P>

131	Eurocopter pointed out as follows:
<P>

	<i> `The experts were cross-examined (27 June 1997 - see TP. Pages 4 -19, Tab
25), and senior counsel for Elspan sought and was granted
leave to ask
supplementary questions in writing of the experts upon the "Issues of Fact"
(Ex.P5) see TP 35-40 of 28 June 1997 on
the issue.  The supplementary questions
became exhibit Expt 2A, and question 9.0 was in the following terms:</i>
<P>

<i>	"Is Elspan entitled to a sum for de-commissioning and cleaning up the site?
If so, in what amount?"</i>
<P>

<i>	That question was answered in the supplementary joint report of the experts
of 4 July 1997, exhibit Expt 2B.  The answer to question
9.0 was as
follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	"The joint report allows for preliminaries for a 12-week period.  The
labour included in the preliminaries allows for progressive
site cleaning.
There is no special allowance for any cleaning up or de-commissioning after
termination."</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	There was, in the proceedings, no real distinction between
"de-commissioning" and "site clean up".  Elspan's submissions now
refer to it
virtually exclusively as "de-commissioning" but, in cross examination before
the arbitrator, Mr John Ellen was content
to refer to it s "site clean up" for
a claim for $10,000;  transcript 5 July 1997, pages 118(46); (48-54).  During
his examination
in chief, Elspan's counsel had referred to it as "site clean up
costs"; TP91 (27).</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	It is submitted that it is clear from the joint supplementary report
that the expert quantity surveyors considered that all reasonable
costs after
termination were included in the amount of $184,780 for preliminaries.'</i>
<P>

132	Elspan's claims including the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(ii)</a> claim, with respect to
this item are rejected.
<P>

	<b>Delay</b>
<P>

133	Elspan's submissions in this regard pressed in its <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42</a> case, were as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`2.1	Substantial periods of time still remain unaccounted for even making
full allowances for all the factors which Mr Markham in
his undisputed oral and
written statements referred to the affidavits of Mr W Biggs sworn 18th December
1998 and Mr John Ellen sworn
18th December 1998 claims to have caused his delay
in making the award.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.2	Furthermore some of the statements made by him are not supported by the
facts which he has disclosed.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.3	On the 29th May 1998, Mr Biggs received a fax from Mr Markham Tab "D",
in which Mr Markham blamed the delay on a priority reference
having been sent
to him by the Supreme Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	On 25 August 1998, Tab "J" to Mr W Biggs' affidavit, Mr Markham stated that
on several occasions the quality time allocated to writing
the Award was
consumed by other hearings extending unexpectedly, due to circumstances outside
his control.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.4	From the chronology, (extracted from Mr Markham's Fax of the 10th
November 1999, Tab "U"), from the 22nd September 1997 to 9
January 1998, Mr
Markham sat as Arbitrator for not longer than one day ie. in the </i><cite>Dorr
Oliver</cite><i> case, when he had a preliminary conference on the 8th December
1997 see para 2 of Tab "U", p.42 and a hearing of unspecified length
in an
unnamed matter in December 1997, see para. 11 p.43.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.5	So therefore from the 22nd September 1997 to the 9th January 1998,
there was a substantial slab of time (say 100 days, less the
time devoted to
the matters stated in para 2.1 above), available to the Arbitrator in which he
could have written his award.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.6	Consequently, his statement to Mr Biggs on 9 January 1998, and for
which see para.4 of Mr Biggs' affidavit sworn 18th December
1998 that "The
delay is due to other matters", presumably relates to "other matters" not
stated in the Arbitrator's fax of 10th November
1998, Tab "U" to Mr Biggs'
affidavit.  The delay during that period is unexplained.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.7.1	On 12 May 1998, Tab "B", he told Mr Biggs that he started working on
Elspan in January 1998.  He had set aside time in February
1998 for the writing
of the Award, but an urgent matter which had ran out to 7 weeks precluded
that.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.7.2	The above statement must be read with his fax of 29th May 1998 Tab
"D", in which Mr Markham stated that a block of time for
the writing of this
award was set aside at the end of February - early March, but this was
overridden by a "priority reference" (</i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i>).</i>
<P>

<i>	2.8    	The Arbitrator's fax Tab "U" discloses that between the 9th January
1998 and the 12th May 1998:	</i><cite>Days</cite>
<P>

<i>	(a)  He was away from 11th - 16th January 1998;	5</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  There was a half day conference </i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i> on 27th
January 1998;	&#189;</i>

28th January 1998;	1</i>
<P>

<P>

<i>	(i)  There was the report in </i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i> 28 April 1998 (not
stated how long it took to write);</i>
<P>

<i>	and nothing else until the 12th May.</i>
<P>

<i>	              Total	</i><cite>47</cite>
<P>

<i>	over a period of 9th January - 12th May 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.9	Over a period of some 6 weeks, from 25th March - 12th May 1998 only 5
days were taken up with sitting as Arbitrator, there was
time (not stated)
taken for the writing of the </i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i> report.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.10	Even allowing for </i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i> (both the hearing and
writing of the report), what is not explained is why the rest of this fairly
lengthy period was not used for
the writing of the Award.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.11	As stated above, Mr Markham said on 12 May 1998 Tab "B", that he had
set aside time in February 1998 to write his Award.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.12	In his letter of 25 August 1998 Tab "J", Mr Markham said that
"Unfortunately on `several' occasions the quality time allocated
to this
important task has been consumed by other hearings extending unexpectedly due
to circumstances outside my control".</i>
<P>

<i>	2.13	In paragraph 15 of his fax of 10 November 1998, Tab "U", he said that
he had set aside the period 29 June to 15 July to write
the Award, ie. Some 2
weeks.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.14	In all his statements purporting to explain his delay, the only
specific times detailed by him as having been set aside for
the writing of the
Award over the period 22 September 1997 to 14 October 1998, were two 2 week
periods ie 2 weeks at the end of February
/ beginning March 1998, and 2 weeks
say from 29 June to 15 July, 1998. The use of the word "several", in his fax of
25th August 1998
was infelicitous.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.15	In paragraph 12 of Mr Biggs' affidavit he states that on 21st August
1999, Mr Markham told him inter alia that the matter was
complex and he did not
have quality time to devote to it.  But as analysed above there were
substantial periods of apparently available
time within which to write the
Award.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.16	Upon analysis, the only hearings of any length covering the entire
period was the matter of </i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i>, and the two week
arbitration in the unnamed matter commencing 15 June 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.17	By a coincidence the two periods which were used for the
</i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i> hearing and the writing of the
</i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i> Award, were apparently the two periods which he had
set aside to write his Award in Elspan.  He admits as much in the first
paragraph
after his point 18 in his letter of 10 November 1998 (Ex. "U"
p.4).</i>
<P>

<i>	2.18	Accordingly, the "other matters" were in reality two other matters,
being </i><cite>Kezarne</cite><i>, and the unnamed matter.  Neither were
"priority" matters, nor were they matters beyond his control.</i>
<P>

<i>	It follows from the above analysis that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	The Arbitrator's progressive reasons for delay are not substantiated by
his formal response of the 10th November 1998;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Contrary to the assertion in his letter of 25th August 1998, other
hearings did not extend unexpectedly "due to factors outside
[his]
control";</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Most of the other matters which post dated Elspan were within his
control and consumed very much less time than the 13 months
delay
period;</i>

134	Plainly misconduct within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42</a> may include a mistake
in procedure which unjustly prejudices a party.  <i>Cf Melbourne Harbour Trust
Commissioners v Hancock</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1927/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1927] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281927%29%2039%20CLR%20570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1927) 39 CLR 570</a> at 588 per Isaacs J.
<P>

135	In <i>Doran Constructions Pty Ltd v Health Administration Corporation of
NSW</i> (1996) 12 BCL 59 Kirby P observed that legal authorities make plain a
number of well established propositions.  While these are not
strict rules of
law, they are instances of alleged `misconduct' as found by the Courts.
<P>

136	Kirby P outlined the propositions as follows:
<P>

	<i>`(1)	The "misconduct" referred to in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> does not necessarily involve,
at least in the context of arbitration, personal turpitude on the part of the
arbitrator.  See eg.
London Export Corporation Limited v Jubilee Coffee
Roasting Company Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%201%20WLR%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] 1 WLR 661 (CA)</a> at 676.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	In fact, the term may not, by the authorities, amount to much more than
such a mishandling of the arbitration as to be likely
to amount to a
substantial miscarriage of justice.  See Williams v Wallis and Cox  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%202%20KB%20478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] 2 KB
478 (DC)</a> at 485.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)	The mere failure in an arbitration to follow normal court procedures
will not necessarily constitute misconduct in the context
of an arbitration.
This is especially so if a degree of informality was contemplated by the
contract between the parties or by their
subsequent agreement.  See The Owners
of the MV Myron v Tradax Export SA  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20QB%20527" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 QB 527 (QB)</a> at 535.</i>
<P>

<i>	(4)	The mere failure to put a party on notice of an argument as to a point
which might be decided it may not, in the context of an
arbitration,
necessarily amount to misconduct.  See Edible Oils, above at 97.</i>
<P>

<i>	(5)	A misconception, even of the nature of the contentions which the
parties to the arbitration are putting to the arbitrator, may
not necessarily
amount to misconduct.  See Macpherson Train &amp; Company Limited v J Milhem
&amp; Sons  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 2 Lloyds Rep 396.</a></i>
<P>

137	Elspan asserts that by reason of the Arbitrator's delay in making the
award, the Arbitrator ought be removed as Arbitrator pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s44(a)</a>, there
having been misconduct on the part of the Arbitrator or the Arbitrator having
misconducted the proceedings. It is on these
same grounds that Elspan puts its
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> case. Elspan submits that the grounds on which 'misconduct' may be found
include:
<P>

	<i>13.3...</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the Second Defendant's culpable delay in making his award to the
plaintiff; </i><cite>Succula Ltd and Pomona Shipping Co Ltd v Harland and Woolf
Ltd</cite><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 Lloyd's Rep 381</a> at 384, and </i><cite>Lewis Emanuel
&amp; Sons Ltd v Sammut</cite><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20629" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] 2 Lloyd's Rep 629</a>, coupled with
prejudice, </i><cite>Boncorp Pty Ltd v Thames Water Asia/Pacific Pty
Ltd</cite><i> (1996) 12 BCL 139, and or a justifiable lack of confidence in the
second Defendant being able to properly complete his task, </i><cite>State
Construction Pty Ltd v Boulderstone - Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd</cite><i>
(unreported SA Sup Ct 27 March 1997);</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the lack of frankness in Second Defendant's explanation for the
delay</i>
<P>

<i>	...</i>
<P>

<i>	13.4	In amplification of the submission that the Plaintiff has been
prejudiced by the delay, there are the following considerations:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Because of the extraordinary culpable and unexplained delay in making
the interim award, and the rush in so doing that followed
when the Second
Defendant was threatened with an application for his removal, the Second
Defendant forgot the evidence ...and was
generally driven into error;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the delay has resulted in the Plaintiff losing interest on costs
invested in the arbitration and also put up as security for
costs</i>
<P>

138	In considering Elpan's argument that the Arbitrator's delay in giving his
determination amounted to misconduct, I have had regard
to the relevant
authorities.
<P>

139	In <i>Haskins &amp; Anor v Brae-Villa Homes Pty Ltd</i> (Unreported,
Supreme Court of Vic, 15 Dec 1995, Nathan J) Nathan J made it clear that he was
prepared to accept that a ground for
seeking relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> is delay of the
Arbitrator where the Arbitrator was "tardy in the process of arbitration to
such a degree, that it should be seen
that he misconducted himself" (at page
5). However, his Honour found that in the circumstances of the case, the delay
between the
hearing and the delivery of the Interim Award some six months later
was not productive of misconduct of the Arbitrator. This is because,
as a
finding of fact, the reasons for the delay were manifold, including a delay
generated by the applicants themselves and by the
respondents. 
<P>

140	Delay in the context of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> had previously been considered by Byrne J in<i>
Boncorp Pty Ltd v Thames Water Asia/Pacific Pty Ltd</i> (1996) 12 BCL 139. In
that case, the plaintiff submitted that the Arbitrator's long delay in
publishing the award (some eight and
half months), the reasons given for the
delay, and the terms of the award itself led to an inference that the
Arbitrator misconducted
himself inasmuch as he did not decide the dispute on
its merits and did not bring to task a fair and unprejudiced mind.  In
dismissing
the application, his Honour concluded at 142:
<P>

	<i>'The period of time which has elapsed from the completion of the hearing
and the publication of the award is doubtless a matter of
regret. Doubtless,
also, it made the award writing task of the arbitrator so much more difficult.
But I do not consider that the
legitimate interests of either party were
prejudiced as a result. I conclude that the fact of delay and the terms of the
award do
not lead to the kind of inference for which Boncorp contended.'</i>
<P>

141	Similarly, in <i>State Construction Pty Ltd v Boulderstone - Hornibrook
Engineering Pty Ltd</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of SA, 27 March 1997,
Matheson J) Matheson J held that although the Arbitrator took a longer time
than
was desirable in ruling on a pleading, in the circumstances of the case
such delay did not amount to misconduct. His Honour held
that neither the
Arbitrator's statement that his decision would be delivered "in about a week's
time", or the failure of the Arbitrator
to provide reasons for the delay, which
exceeded six months, really advanced the plaintiff's argument in all the
circumstances of
the case.  
<P>

142	Clearly, Elspan's submissions as to the effect of the Arbitrator's delay
(in combination with other factors) require to be weighed
in the particular
circumstances before the Court when raised.
<P>

143	None of the matters here relied upon by Elspan satisfy me that the delay
that was here involved and the matters relied upon
in association with it
amounted relevantly to misconduct.  This is not to say that the Arbitrator
approached the matter with expedition.
 His delay in handing down the Award is
to be regretted.  However, none of the matters relied upon by Elspan to my
mind, show that
the delay which undoubtedly occurred, resulted in a particular
prejudice to Elspan.
<P>

144	There is further the consideration that Elspan elected to await the
decision of the Arbitrator and clearly enough to abide the
decision if it was
favourable to Elspan.  Conduct of that type was dealt with by Bingham J in
<i>Shield Properties &amp; Investments Limited v Anglo Overseas Trade Co
Ltd</i> [12 January 1985] 273 (6216) Estate Gazettes 69.
<P>

145	In that case, the respondents to an arbitration applied to set aside or
remit the award of a sole arbitrator under sections
22 or 23 of the Arbitration
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> (1950) UK on the grounds of misconduct or procedural irregularity.  The
`misconduct' complained of was that the applicant, contrary
to preliminary
direction by the Arbitrator, referred to `without prejudice' negotiations
between the parties in submissions before
the Arbitrator.
<P>

146	Bingham J, in examining the circumstances which gave rise to the complaint,
noted that while the respondent referred to the
transgression by the applicants
in counter-submission to the Arbitrator, they did not seek to halt the
proceedings, or to require
a decision by the Arbitrator that the negotiations
had been without prejudice, or to require an undertaking that the reference
would
be ignored.  In short, they allowed the matter to proceed.
<P>

147	His Honour stated at 73:
<P>

	<i>`It seems to me that the situation was clearly one in which the tenants had
an election.  Either they made a bold and unequivocal
protest and raised the
matter, either seeking a determination or seeking to halt the proceedings
entirely on the basis that the arbitrator
could no longer fairly dispose of the
matter or they could allow the matter to continue.  It seems to me plain on the
information
before me that they adopted that latter course and I bear in mind
that even if the material was brought to his attention, and should
not have
been, he had a discretion to continue if satisfied that no injustice would be
done by doing so.  Had the matter been explored
I have no doubt that he would
have indicated that he paid no attention to that evidence at all and I very
strongly suspect that the
matter would have proceeded on that understanding.
But, be that as it may, it was, I think, up to the tenants to make their
position
plain, to make a stand if they wished to insist on this point and not
to allow the arbiration [sic] to proceed, reserving their right
to challenge
the result on this ground if it proved to be unattractive to them.
Accordingly, as it seems to me, this ground of challenge
fails.'</i>
<P>

148	To my mind, the delay, and/or the delay in combination with the other
matters complained of, do not amount to misconduct on
the part of the
Arbitrator, or the Arbitrator having misconducted the proceedings.  Elspan's
submissions in this regard are without
substance.  They are rejected.
<P>

	<b>Costs and Further Orders</b>
<P>

149	I reject Elspan's submissions that in the circumstances, the Arbitrator
ought no longer be permitted to determine costs of the
arbitration.  There is
no lack of confidence in the Arbitrator determining that matter entirely
impartially.  The Arbitrator's own
conduct which has been found to amount to
relevant misconduct does not lead to a holding that he has not retained the
degree of impartiality
necessary to enable him to determine costs.
<P>

150	Short Minutes of Order should be brought in.  Costs may be argued when
Short Minutes are brought in.
<P>

Appendices A to C are not included
