THE SUPREME COURT

OF NEW SOUTH WALES

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 30 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>11139/1996</u>	<u>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION v PENELOPE G CAPPER (ALSO
KNOWN AS PENELOPE G PICKERING)</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	During a period of about nine to twelve years ago, the plaintiff
served assessments on the defendant.  The liability was in
the order of
$360,000.00.  In January 1995, application was made for waiver of the tax
liability.  In March 1995, the application
was refused by the plaintiff.  A
similar application by certain of other siblings had been allowed.
<P>

2  	These proceedings were commenced on 7 March 1996.  The
proceedings are founded on the unpaid assessments.  On 13 May 1999, by
consent
there was an entry of judgment for the plaintiff.  The defendant applied for a
stay of proceedings.  The application came
before Registrar Irwin.  On 20 May
1999, the Registrar delivered his decision.  It is a written decision.  The
application was refused
with costs.
<P>

3  	There had been proceedings brought in the Federal Court (pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39B</a> (1) of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</u> 1903</a>).  The proceedings have been
dismissed.  The defendant then brought proceedings (QG 153/97) pursuant to the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act</u> 1977</a> (The Federal Court
proceedings).  In the Federal Court proceedings, the defendant seeks a review
of the decision refusing the application
for waiver of tax liability.  The
proceedings have been fixed for hearing to take place on 13, 14 and 15 October
1999.
<P>

4  	The Federal Court proceedings are relevant to part only of the
defendant's existing tax liability.  Since the matter has been
before the
Registrar, the defendant has made a further application.  This is an
application made to the Tax Relief Board for release
from payment of the
balance of the liability.  The Court has been told that this application has
been made on the basis of hardship.
<P>

5  	The defendant now seeks a review of the decision of the
Registrar.  A hearing took place on 19 July 1999 (strictly speaking
it was not
a review because the defendant had sought to adduce fresh evidence).  The Court
had before it the material placed before
the Registrar together with a further
affidavit sworn by Mr Peace on 14 July 1999 (it deposed to matters that had
transpired since
the decision of the Registrar).  The review principles were
not in contest.  The applicant bears the onus of satisfying the Court
that the
decision of the Registrar should be disturbed.
<P>

6  	The Court has a discretionary power to grant a stay (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/index.html#p44" class="autolink_findacts">Part 44</a>
rule 5 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules 1970</a>).  In the exercise of its discretion,
the Court has regard to the relevant circumstances of the particular case
before it and is
concerned that justice is best served between the parties.
The applicant bears the onus of demonstrating an entitlement to relief.
<P>

7  	The Court has been referred to a number of decided cases
(including <u>Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Mackey</u> 82 ATC 4563,
<u>Alexander &amp; Ors v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (Receivers Appointed)
&amp; Anor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 685</a> and <u>DCT v HO</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20ATR%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">32 ATR 269).</a>
<P>

8  	There has been reference to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/s14zzr.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 14ZZR</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/s14zzm.html" class="autolink_findacts">14ZZM</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/" class="autolink_findacts">Taxation Administration Act</u> 1953</a>.  These sections make provision to the
effect that the fact that an appeal or a review is pending in relation to a tax
decision does
not in the meantime interfere with or affect the decision and any
tax may be recovered as if no appeal or review was pending.  It
is common
ground that the application for review pending in the Federal Court proceedings
is not a review in the sense contemplated
by these sections.  Nevertheless, it
is contended by the plaintiff that these provisions implement a legislative
policy which has
application in the present case.
<P>

9  	There is authority to the effect that such provisions disclose
legislative policy and that it is a matter to which weight should
be
attached.
<P>

10  	In this case, the tax liability due under the assessments has
merged in the judgment of this Court.  The effect of the sections
is really not
dissimilar to the principles of general law which relate to judgments (viz a
judgment is presumed to be correctly entered
and is liable to be enforced until
it is disturbed (by appeal or otherwise)).
<P>

11  	The defendant contends that the decision of the Registrar is
flawed by reason of a number of errors.  It seems to me, that
for present
purposes it is not necessary to pursue these contentions.  The real question is
whether or not the decision should be
disturbed and a stay granted.
<P>

12  	The prospects of success of the pending application for review
in the Federal Court proceedings are far from clear.  What is
known is that a
similar application for waiver made by certain of the other siblings was
successful.  The pending review relates
to part only of the tax liability.
There is a lack of material to contemplate the prospects of success of the
application for release.
 In the light of the material, the Court is not really
in a position to make a preliminary assessment of the defendant's prospects
of
being relieved of her tax burden.
<P>

13  	This is not a case in which it can be said that recovery back of
the judgment moneys (if the applications made by the defendant
are successful)
would be improbable.  On the defendant's case, such a situation would not
arise.  There is material in which it is
asserted that the defendant lacks the
financial resources to satisfy the judgment.
<P>

14  	The attitude of the plaintiff is unhelpful.  Whilst there is no
pending threat of execution of the judgment, the position taken
by the
plaintiff has engendered some fear or uncertainty that bankruptcy proceedings
may be brought.  The plaintiff is prepared to
say little more than that it is
presently considering its position.
<P>

15  	In the past, there has been a demonstrable lack of urgency both
in the steps taken to recover the tax and the prosecution of
these proceedings.
The plaintiff has taken bankruptcy action in relation to certain of the other
siblings.  However, in this case,
it would seem unlikely that the defendant
could be made bankrupt prior to the disposition of the pending application.
The Federal
Court proceedings have a hearing date in October next.  Further, if
any proceedings are brought, there is the prospect of them being
adjourned
until inter alia the Federal Court proceedings are disposed of.
<P>

16  	If the Federal Court proceedings are resolved adversely to the
plaintiff, any bankruptcy proceedings brought prior to the determination
could
prove abortive and see the plaintiff throwing away costs.  A sudden flurry of
activity from the plaintiff in this matter would
seem unusual and may be
productive of little advantage.  Commonsense would indicate that further action
should abide inter alia the
result of the Federal Court proceedings.
<P>

17  	The present state of affairs arises because of the attitude
adopted by the plaintiff.  Whilst there is no pending threat of
enforcement
action, the plaintiff is not prepared to give any indication that it will not
take action either pending the disposition
of the Federal Court proceedings or
until further notice.  If such a stance had been taken, the defendant may not
have been led to
a position where she felt the need to bring an application for
a stay.
<P>

18  	Be that as it may, it does not seem to me that the material
placed before the Court throws up circumstances justifying the
grant of a stay.
In my view, the defendant has failed to discharge the relevant onus.  In these
circumstances, there is no basis
for disturbing the decision of the
Registrar.
<P>

19  	I dismiss the Notice of Motion filed on 17 June 1999.  The
question of costs has its complications.  In the circumstances of
this case, I
consider that justice is best served if each party bears their own costs and I
so order.
<P>
