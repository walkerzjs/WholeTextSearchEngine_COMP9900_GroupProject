CORPORATIONS - Winding Up - Summons to Produce Books - Application to Set
Aside
<P>

Summons to produce books required production of correspondence between
connected entities of the corporation and their auditor.
 Application brought
to set aside relevant paragraphs, except to the extent that the items in
question related or appeared to relate
to the corporation.  There was evidence
that the financial viability of the corporation was bound up with that of the
connected entities.
 HELD that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it
could be inferred that all the correspondence was, or appeared to be,
relevant
to the corporation; and that no justification was shown for imposing any
limitation on the paragraphs.

<b><u>APPLICATION OF DORAN CONSTRUCTIONS PTY. LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>(IN LIQUIDATION)</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   I am dealing with two Notices of Motion which seek to set aside
certain paragraphs of two summonses brought under
s.596A of the Corporations
Law, except to the extent that the items in such paragraphs relate, or appear
to relate, to Doran Constructions
Pty. Limited (in liquidation), or its
affairs.
<P>

2	The summonses have been brought by the liquidator of Doran Constructions Pty.
Limited, and in those circumstances s.569D(2) authorises
only a requirement
that the person summoned produce books that are in the person's possession and
relate to that corporation or to
any of its examinable affairs.  "Examinable
affairs" is defined in s.9 of the Corporations Law in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>"Examinable affairs", in relation to a corporation means:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	the promotion, formation, management, administration or winding up
of the corporation; or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	any other affairs of the corporation (including anything that is
included in the corporation's affairs because of section 53);
or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(c)	the business affairs of a connected entity of the corporation, in so
far as they are, or appear to be, relevant to the corporation
or to anything
that is included in the corporation's examinable affairs because of paragraph
(a) or (b).</i></b>
<P>

3	The particular paragraphs of the summons which are challenged have the same
content, although they are numbered differently in
the different summonses.  I
will set out in the judgment paragraphs 345, 346 and 348-354 of the summons
which was issued to Peter
Joseph Doran.  Those paragraphs are in the following
terms:
<P>

	<b><i>345.	A copy of the recommendations by Ernst and Young in 1991 regarding
the reconstruction of the companies that together comprise
the Doran
Group.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	346.	Copy of all correspondence and working papers generated by the
Directors, the employees, the in-house accountant, the external
accountant or
the auditor of any company within the Doran Group, relating to the
rationalisation of the companies within the Doran
Group giving rise to
correspondence between Ernst &amp; Young and DH and/or any other company in the
Doran Group regarding the rationalisation
within the Group.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	348.	All correspondence between either DC, CH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the year ended 30 June 1992.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	349.	All correspondence between either DC, DH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the year ended 30 June 1993.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	350.	All correspondence between either DC, DH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the year ended 30 June 1994.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	351.	All correspondence between either DC, DH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the year ended 30 June 1995.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	352.	All correspondence between either DC, DH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the year ended 30 June 1996.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	353.	All correspondence between either DC, DH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the year ended 30 June 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	354.	All correspondence between either DC, DH, DCA, DPS and Price
Waterhouse for the period ended 31 December 1997.</i></b>
<P>

4	The letters "DC" in some of those paragraphs refer to Doran Constructions
Pty. Limited.  The letters "DH" refer to Doran Holdings
Pty. Limited (which is
a connected entity of Doran Constructions).  The letters "DCA" refer to Doran
Constructions Australia Pty.
Limited (which at least in recent years has been
the holding company of Doran Constructions).  The letters "DPS" refer to Doran
Property
Services Pty. Limited, another subsidiary of Doran Constructions
Australia.  The four companies together are generally referred to
as the Doran
Group.
<P>

5	There are in evidence searches of these companies which disclose that, as at
January this year at least, Price Waterhouse or Price
Waterhouse Coopers was
the auditor of each of these companies.  There are in evidence two letters from
that firm to the liquidator
dated respectively 27th May 1998 and 11th August
1998.  
<P>

6	The first of those letters refers to a loan of money from Doran Holdings to
Doran Constructions Australia to enable Doran Constructions
Australia to
purchase shares in Doran Constructions and Doran Property Services from Doran
Holdings, the loan totalling about $4.8
million.  The letter asserts that this
transaction was completed as part of the restructure of the Group that was
recommended by
Ernst &amp; Young in 1991, and which was completed in 1992.  The
letter went on to assert that proper consideration was calculated
and paid, and
that this was part of a continuing process to simplify and rationalise the
Doran Group.
<P>

7	The second letter of 11th August 1998 contains assertions that in about 1995,
there was a loan owing by Doran Constructions Australia
to Doran Constructions
of $4.1 million which was expected to be repaid in full over time.  It was
asserted there was a potential
for approximately $1.4 million to be repaid in a
relatively short period of time by the call up of a loan to Doran Property
Services
by Doran Holdings.  The letter went on to assert that the remainder
would be paid over time through dividends from Doran Constructions
Australia's
subsidiaries, Doran Constructions and Doran Property Services.  It then went on
to note that the $4.1 million loan was
reduced by $1.6 million over a three
year period by 28th November 1997.  The earlier letter had noted that, on that
day, the remaining
debt of about $2.5 million was forgiven by Doran
Constructions Australia in order to allow a members voluntary liquidation to
proceed.
<P>

8	Mr. Martin for the applicants concedes that this material justifies an
inference that the financial viability of Doran Constructions
over the years
between about 1991 and 1997 was bound up with the financial viability of the
three other companies in the Group. 
However, he submits that this does not
support an inference that all items in the paragraphs to which I have referred
are relevant
to, or appear to be relevant to, Doran Constructions or its
affairs.  He submits that many of such items may not be so relevant,
and may
not appear to be so relevant; and that accordingly the applicants are entitled
to have those paragraphs limited to the items
that are, or appear to be,
relevant to Doran Constructions.
<P>

9	In my opinion, that conclusion is not justified.  In my opinion, prima facie
all correspondence between a company and its auditors
over a period of time
will be relevant to the financial viability of that company.  It may be that
there is some correspondence which
is not so relevant; but if all one knows is
that there is a question of financial viability, and that there is
correspondence between
the corporation and its auditors, the probability is
that all such correspondence will be relevant to that viability.  It seems to
me that if the corporation or persons knowing all the details of that
correspondence choose not to put before the Court any material
to suggest that
there is any such correspondence which is not so relevant, the Court is well
justified in drawing the inferences
that it is all relevant.  That is the
position in this case.  And if all the correspondence is relevant to the
viability of one or
other of the four companies, it thereby becomes relevant to
Doran Constructions and its affairs, as set out in paragraph 8.  
<P>

10	In those circumstances, it seems to me that there is no justification for
imposing a limitation on the paragraphs in the summons
issued on behalf of the
liquidator.  The effect of such a limitation would be to put it in the hands of
the person being summonsed
to make a decision as to whether or not  a
particular document is relevant, or appears to be relevant, to Doran
Constructions or
its affairs.  It may be in some circumstances appropriate to
do that.  In this case, it seems to me that it has not been shown to
be
appropriate or justified to take that course.  On the evidence before me, it
seems that I can infer, and in my opinion I should
infer, that all documents in
the particular categories do relate to the corporation or its examinable
affairs.
<P>

11	I stand this matter over to 9th March 1999 for Short Minutes to be brought
in.
