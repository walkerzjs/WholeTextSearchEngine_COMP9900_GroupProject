<b>JUDGMENT (On Plaintiff's Notice of Motion re "<i>structure</i>" of
trial)</b>
<P>

1   	By Notice of Motion filed in Court on 18 October 1999 the
plaintiff applies for the following orders:
<P>

<i>"1.	That the plaintiff not be cross-examined by the defendant until the
hearing of all the defence evidence on its truth defences
in both
actions.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Alternatively, that the plaintiff's cross-examination by the defendant
after giving evidence in relation to the damages section
be limited to damages
and cross-examination in respect of truth be subject to cross-examination after
the plaintiff has given evidence
in relation to the truth question.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Alternatively, for such orders as the Court deems fit".</i>
<P>

2   	A cognate application was made on 9 February 1999 and
decided adversely to the plaintiff ([1999] NSWSC 28:  DLJT: 4).
<P>

3   	The import of the application as explained by Mr Marsden
(who argued it himself) was that the cross-examination of the plaintiff
upon
his having giving evidence on damages be either (a) adjourned until the
plaintiff has given evidence on justification;  or (b)
he be allowed to give
evidence on damages in his justification case (that is, in rebuttal of the
defence case on justification) or
(c) that the cross-examination of the
plaintiff after he has given evidence (in a case in chief, as I understand it),
on damages
be restricted to damages.  The plaintiff says that of the three
alternatives the last only is likely to cause the defendant any
disadvantage.
<P>

4   	I am asked to exercise the powers and discretion provided
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> and SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 2. 
<P>

5   	It is submitted that I should take either of the first or
second courses and make an order accordingly on the basis of "<i>fairness"</i>
in the light of the peculiar nature of this defamation action.
<P>

6   	The imputations found by the jury, it is submitted, are of
the utmost gravity.  It is of course part of the plaintiff's case
on damages
that they are false.  As to the gravity of the imputations that, in the normal
course, is a factor to be taken into account
if and when damages are to be
assessed.  For the purposes of this interlocutory application it is sufficient
for me to acknowledge
that the imputations are, of course, very serious.  I do
not propose to embark upon a qualitative comparison between the imputations
here found by the jury and imputations that have been litigated in other
defamation actions.  In the course of submissions Mr Marsden
remarked that he
would rather falsely be accused of being a murderer than be falsely accused of
being paedophile.  The seriousness
of the imputations as a factor by itself is
not persuasive.  It is of the essence of defamation actions that imputations
are serious
and alleged to be false on the issue of damages.
<P>

7   	The touchstone of Mr Marsden's position is the asserted
unfairness of him being in "<i>double jeopardy</i>".  That state of affairs
would come about by his being cross-examined twice on the issue of
justification.  In what I will for the
sake of convenience call the "<i>normal
course</i>" the plaintiff in a defamation action in which there is a defence of
justification, and in which the plaintiff in chief relies upon
the falsity of
the imputations for damages, would expect to be cross-examined on any evidence
he gave as to hurt to feelings by reason
of the falsity of the imputations and
to have put to him the defence case on justification.  Upon the defence
presenting <i>its </i>evidence on justification in support of the issue on
which it bears the onus, the plaintiff, again, in the <i>"normal course</i>"
can call his case in rebuttal.  In the event of the calling of the plaintiff's
case in rebuttal, the plaintiff goes into the witness
box again, the ambit of
the testimony of the plaintiff in those circumstances would be circumscribed.
As far as cross-examination
is concerned and this appears to have been conceded
by Mr Wheelhouse for the defendant, in the normal course, the plaintiff could
not be required to be cross-examined again on the same subject matters that
were put to him in cross-examination during his giving
evidence in his case in
chief.  Further, of course, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 41</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i> must be
taken into account.
<P>

8   	Insofar as concern was expressed, by way of example, in
relation to one anticipated witness for the defendant, it is said that
it would
be unfair to the plaintiff to be cross-examined on allegations this witness
would be called to make in circumstances where
the plaintiff knew that the
witness has made varying statements concerning the alleged events.  When there
exists accepted forensic
mechanisms for dealing with a situation of the kind
that gives rise to concern in the plaintiff, whilst the statement of concern
might be noted it is not persuasive to the point where I can make rulings the
effect of which is merely to obviate some concern in
the plaintiff which exists
in the face of the <i>"normal course" </i>being followed in this piece of civil
litigation.  
<P>

9   	I am of the view that the ultimate objective sought by the
making of this application is essentially that same as that sought
in the
application upon which I gave judgment on 9 February.  Certainly there have
been changes in circumstances;  the defendant
case has been expanded on the
issue of justification as a result of my ruling on 23 June 1999 (DLJT: 44).  In
my earlier judgment
I drew attention (paragraph 19) to the distinction between
the particularisation of a defence case and the evidence called in support
of
it.  The situation presently exists where I have required the defendant to
provide to the plaintiff proofs of evidence of the
witnesses the defendant
proposes to call on the issue of justification.  The plaintiff's knowledge of
the defence case is, to that
extent, now far better than it was in February
even taking into account the amendments, if not, by reason of the circumstances
in
which the leave to amend was granted.
<P>

10   	Both Mr Marsden and Mr Wheelhouse reminded me of the
authorities to which I referred in my judgement of 9 February 1999 and
I do not
propose to repeat what I said in relation to them (paragraphs 21-27), those
case being <b><i>Jerome v Anderson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%2044%20DLR%20%282d%29%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 44 DLR (2d) 516</a>; <b><i>Beevis
v Dawson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%201%20QB%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 1 QB 195</a>;  <b><i>Downs Irrigation Cooperative
Association Limited v National Bank of Australasia Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20Qd%20R%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) Qd R
130.</a>
<P>

11   	Mr Marsden also relied upon, as a material change, the
state of his legal representation.  Mr Marsden, as I have said, argued
this
application in person.  Mr M Hall of junior counsel has over the last week
appeared for Mr Marsden in relation to other interlocutory
matters;  Mr
Reynolds S.C. will be appearing in relation to two interlocutory matters, as I
understand it;  Mr Donohoe Q.C. is available
for some time to represent Mr
Marsden in regard to the damages component of his case.  As far as I can
understand it, there is a
suggestion that subject to when the event occurs, Mr
Barker Q.C. may well be available to represent Mr Marsden when the defendant
presents its case on justification.  This is a state of uncertainty which it
has to be acknowledged gives rise to satisfaction in
nobody.  But again it is
not a factor of such persuasion as to oblige me or compel me to order the
departure from the "<i>normal course</i>" by itself or together with the other
factors to which I have referred.  A litigant in person enjoys of course some
indulgences;
 that litigant is bound by the same rights and rules and
obligations as any other litigant and as any other litigant who may be
represented.
 Any indulgence granted to a litigant in person is not at the
expense of the interests of justice as it affects both parties to the
particular cause.
<P>

12   	It was argued by Mr Wheelhouse that in effect I would be
giving judicial advice and by acceding to the plaintiff's application
would in
effect be taking a position which is simply a matter entirely for him (cf.
<b><i>Urban Transport Authority of NSW v Nweiser</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2028%20NSWLR%20471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 28 NSWLR 471</a>
per Clarke JA at 476A-D).  I consider there to be merit in the substance of
this submission.  Not being persuaded that there is any
basis for making any
order of the kind sought by the plaintiff on the grounds of fairness and in
accordance with any discretion I
have under the Act, the Rules or at common
law, that should be the end of the matter.  Otherwise to take any step along
the lines
suggested by the plaintiff would be in effect taking a decision that
is entirely in his hands.  As Mr Marsden quite candidly remarked
in the event
of his application failing it will then be "<i>his call</i>".  
<P>

13   	I am not persuaded that there is any reason to depart from
the approach I took in my judgment of 9 February 1999 or discretely
that any
basis has been made out to grant the relief sought in the present
application.
<P>

14   	The Notice of Motion is dismissed.
