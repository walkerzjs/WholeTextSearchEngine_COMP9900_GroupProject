<b>50046/1999 - STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LIMITED v ROSS WILLIAM
MITCHELL-PATERSON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Case</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, State Bank of New South Wales Limited, for
which Mr G. Lucarelli of Counsel appeared, brought proceedings against
the
defendant, Mr Ross William Mitchell-Paterson, by a Summons filed on 12 April
1999, which sought orders that the defendant pay
to it $998,556.01, interest
thereon and costs on an indemnity basis.
<P>

2   	The Summons pleaded that by written lease agreements
entered into between the plaintiff and Power Distribution (Australia)
Pty
Limited, as hirer, ("the hirer"), it agreed to lease certain goods to it, which
it did, and that the hirer agreed to pay rental
instalments under the terms of
those agreements.  It pleaded that the defendant gave a written guarantee to it
of the hirer's obligations
under each lease; that the hirer fell into arrears
in payment of the rental instalments due under those agreements; that, on 27
January
1999, an amount of $1,088,691 was owed by the hirer to the plaintiff;
and that on that date the plaintiff made written demand on
the defendant for
the payment of it, which was not met.  It further pleaded that as at 7 April
1999 the amount owing by the defendant
to the plaintiff, pursuant to the
guarantees, was that for which it sued.
<P>

<b>Judgment For The Plaintiff</b>
<P>

3   	The proceedings came before me for directions on 30 April
1999.  Ms Rowe, Solicitor, appeared for the plaintiff and Mr S. McAnulty
of
Counsel appeared for the defendant.  I was informed that discussions were
proceeding in an attempt to resolve the matter, and,
by consent, I stood it
over until 7 May 1999.  On that day Ms Rowe mentioned the matter on behalf of
both parties and I was asked,
by consent, to direct that the defendant file and
serve a Defence and an Affidavit of Facts and Circumstances by 4 pm on 20 May
1999.
 The defendant thus assumed, by consent, an obligation, on 7 May 1999, to
file and serve these documents within thirteen days.  I
listed the matter for
further directions on 21 May 1999, on which day Ms Rowe appeared and I granted
leave to the plaintiff to sign
judgment in the Registry, subject to compliance
with the Rules of Court and notwithstanding that the proceedings were commenced
by
way of Summons.  The circumstances in which that occurred appear in the
judgment I gave on that date.  Put shortly Ms Rowe informed
me that she had
been told by Mr McAnulty that the defendant would not be filing a Defence or
further defending the proceedings. 
The defendant did not appear, as I had
noted.  I have no doubt that what Ms Rowe told me was the truth, the contrary
has never been
suggested and she has subsequently verified by an affidavit her
conversation with Mr McAnulty.  Mr McAnulty has given no evidence
denying that
conversation or casting any doubt or qualification on it.  The defendant,
however, has denied that he gave Mr McAnulty
any such instructions, but Mr
McAnulty has not been called to support that denial.
<P>

<b>Application To Set Aside Judgment  </b>
<P>

4   	On 22 June 1999 the defendant filed a Notice of Motion to
set aside the judgment entered on 21 May 1999 and for an order that
pending the
determination of the Notice of Motion the proceedings be stayed.
<P>

5   	On 2 July 1999 Mr A.Houen of Counsel, who appeared for the
defendant, mentioned the matter on behalf of the parties and, by
consent, I
stood the Notice of Motion over to 16 July 1999.  On that date Mr P.T. Sweney,
who appeared for the plaintiff, mentioned
the matter on behalf of both parties
and, by consent, I stood it over until 6 August 1999.
<P>

6   	On 6 August 1999 the matter came before Einstein J.  The
defendant applied to his Honour for an adjournment to enable him to
file
additional evidence in support of his Notice of Motion.  His Honour noted the
circumstances in which that occurred, and acceded
to his application for
further time:-
<P>

<b>".. but only to the extent of a direction that the further evidence be filed
and served by 19 August 1999."</b>
<P>

His Honour gave further directions for the conduct of the matter.
<P>

7   	On 20 August 1999 the matter came before me.  Mr Lucarelli
appeared for the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in person.
 I stood the
Notice of Motion over for hearing to Friday, 27 August 1999 and directed the
defendant to file any further evidence
upon which he wished to rely in support
of it.
<P>

8   	On 27 August 1999 the hearing of the Notice of Motion
commenced, the defendant appearing in person.  He applied for a further
adjournment on several grounds, which I have set out in my reasons of 27 August
1999 in which I referred to the fact that both Einstein
J, on 6 August 1999,
and I, on 20 August 1999, had made it clear that if the defendant wished to
proceed with his Notice of Motion
he must be ready to do so "so far as Einstein
J was concerned, last week, and so far as I was concerned, to-day".  I
continued:-
<P>

<b>"Nothing which has been put before me satisfies me that there should be any
further adjournment of the Notice of Motion and the application
is
refused."</b>
<P>

9   	The defendant conducted the hearing of the Notice of Motion
on 27 August 1999.  Towards the conclusion of the hearing on that
day I
suggested to the parties that they take certain matters to which I referred at
Tp.29 into consideration:-
<P>

<b>".. because I am not going to allow this hearing to become in effect a trial
of the action, although it seems to me that there are
certain issues, triable
issues which are emerging and perhaps the quickest way of resolving this would
be to have an early hearing
of the whole of the proceedings.  That, of course,
would involve my setting aside the judgment.  What I have just said is not to
be taken as a concluded view, but as a view on which I would like the parties
to reflect between now and 1 October 1999."</b>
<P>

<b>The Need For A Defence</b>
<P>

10   	The matter came back before me on 24 September 1999 when I
was presented with Short Minutes of Order whereby the plaintiff
consented to
the judgment's being set aside.  The Short Minutes also sought directions to
ready the substantive matter for hearing.
 I made directions, once again by
consent, that the defendant file and serve a Defence, an affidavit of facts and
circumstances giving
rise to the Defence and any draft Cross-Claims by 4 pm on
14 October 1999, and I stood the matter over for directions to 15 October
1999.
The plaintiff had originally pressed for the date 8 October 1999 for the filing
by the defendant of the documents to which
I have just referred, but I acceded
to the defendant's request that it be extended to 14 October 1999 to give him
the time he was
seeking, and stood the matter over to 15 October 1999.   I
stress that the defendant was given the time he sought to file the documents,
which it was not in issue were required from him.
<P>

11   	On 15 October 1999, the defendant was represented by Ms N.
Mikhael of Counsel, who made a further application for an adjournment
to allow
the defendant to file and serve his Defence, an affidavit of facts and
circumstances and any Cross-Claims.  The application
was supported by an
affidavit of the defendant in which he relied, substantially, on the inability
to obtain legal assistance.  This
was the essential basis of his previous
request for further time, which had been granted.  However, it did not alter
the simple fact
that the defendant was in breach of directions given by the
Court at his request.
<P>

12   	In reasons I gave on that day I set forth the history of
the proceedings, and I said:-
<P>

<b>"So far as I am concerned, the matter has now reached a stage where the
Court is going to have to take some fairly drastic action.
 I say that because
the defendant has had since May of 1999 to prepare any Defence and Cross-Claims
upon which he wishes to rely.
 If I may say so, his cross-examination of the
witness before me and the way in which he generally dealt with the matter
showed that
he has a lively appreciation of the issues which are involved and,
whilst it has been said on a number of occasions that they are
complex, as I
have just said, it appeared to me, at least prima facie, that the defendant has
a good grasp of the factual and some
of the legal issues involved in the
matter."</b>
<P>

My reference to "May of 1999" was, of course, a reference to the consent
directions for filing a defence.  I referred to the fact
that I was aware that
the defendant should have a reasonable opportunity to put forward his defence,
and that I considered that he
had had such an opportunity, but that I thought
there was "just sufficient evidence" in his affidavit of 15 October 1999 "to
indicate
to me that he has been taking some steps to obtain legal advice
without success, but this is not the type of excuse which can be
used on any
sort of a permanent basis to prevent the matter going forward.  Indeed, I think
it should be borne in mind that one matter
which may have operated upon the
plaintiff in agreeing to the judgment being set aside was the prospect of a
reasonably early hearing,
and I am not going to have that expectation thwarted
by continued delay on the part of the defendant".
<P>

13   	I noted that the defendant was then seeking a further
three weeks and that I proposed, with the minor exception of one day,
to grant
that.  I continued:-
<P>

<b>"If there is non-compliance with these orders, I propose to grant leave to
the plaintiff on the next occasion to move for judgment
in consequence of the
defendant's default.</b>
<P>

<b>I note that the defendant is in Court and I am sure, firstly, that he has
heard what I have said and, secondly, that he fully understands
what I have
said.  If he does not, I have no doubt that Miss Mikhael, who appears on his
behalf, will explain it to him."</b>
<P>

14   	In the course of discussion, at a time when the defendant
was present, I said:-
<P>

<b>"Miss Mikhael, what I propose, subject to anything further Mr Lucarelli
seeks to do, is to give your client the three weeks he is
seeking.  If the
Defence and Cross-Claim are not on then, if there is to be a cross-claim, I
will grant the plaintiff leave to move
without formal motion for summary (sic).
On that occasion it has got to be understood that the type of matter referred
to in Mr Mitchell-Paterson's
affidavit will not necessarily be a sufficient
excuse for further delay and something has to be done about this matter.  He
has obtained
a large indulgence from the Court, or from the parties really, but
the matter is far from satisfactory and it is starting to get
to the stage
where it is totally unsatisfactory."</b>
<P>

I am then recorded as noting that the defendant was in Court and was making a
note of what was being said, and that I had no doubt
that he understood what I
was saying.  These statements of my observations were not challenged.  The
transcript concluded with Counsel
stating that she would explain it "all once
again to Mr Mitchell-Paterson".
<P>

15   	The effect of the orders I made on 15 October 1999 was to
extend the time within which the Defence and affidavit of facts
and
circumstances was to be filed to 4 pm on Thursday, 11 November 1999.  I stood
the matter over until Friday, 12 November 1999.
 Once again, save for one day,
the Court had acceded to the defendant's application.
<P>

16   	The various matters to which I have referred are set forth
in the judgments of 21 May 1999, 6 August 1999, 27 August 1999
and 15 October
1999.  There is a complete transcript of the various proceedings.
<P>

<b>Should The Defendant Be Afforded A Further Opportunity?</b>
<P>

17   	It is difficult to conceive of a case in which a defendant
has obtained a greater opportunity from the Court to defend the
proceedings.
Firstly, having had judgment signed against him by default and after he had
consented to directions to file his Defence,
he was successful in having the
plaintiff agree to its being set aside, on the basis that a regime was put in
place for a speedy
hearing.  It therefore became incumbent upon him to file a
Defence and, if he wished, a Cross-Claim.  He has had ample opportunity
to do
that, all the times he has sought, to date, being granted to him in the face of
the plaintiff's opposition.
<P>

18   	On 12 November 1999, the defendant appeared in person and
made a further application for an adjournment of two weeks, so that
he could
prepare his Defence and the affidavit of facts and circumstances.  It was
supported by his affidavit of 12 November 1999.
 That traced the history of his
attempts to obtain legal representation, a theme which had run through much of
his earlier evidence,
and submissions in support of an application for
extensions of time to comply with the directions of the Court.  It also set
forth
the problems being occasioned to him and various members of his family,
and submitted that he had made "every reasonable effort"
to comply with the
orders.  He submitted that:-
<P>

<b>".. it is simply the result of a litany of failure to obtain the right legal
advice due to no fault of my own."</b>
<P>

One might add that none of this was the fault of the plaintiff.
<P>

19   	The defendant said that he had prepared a draft Defence
or, more accurately, portion of a draft Defence, and he tendered that
as
Exhibit A.  That does not disclose anything like a defence to the fairly
straightforward claim which has been brought by the plaintiff.
 The defendant
said, essentially, that he relied upon the material in the affidavit and
Exhibit A in support of the application to
further extend the time for two
weeks.  That would take the time being sought by the defendant to 26 November
1999.
<P>

20   	It is to be borne in mind that the defendant was aware, at
least from 22 June 1999, that there was judgment against him and,
I have no
doubt, he was aware that in order to have the judgment set aside it would be
necessary for him to file a Defence.  He had,
of course, consented in May 1999
to file a Defence within thirteen days.  On 24 September 1999 I gave the
defendant the three week
period he sought to file his Defence and affidavit of
facts and circumstances and, on 15 October 1999, I gave him the period which
he
had sought to do that.  I made clear on that occasion that any further
opportunity may well not succeed.  His then counsel assured
me that this would
be further explained to the defendant, although even without such an
explanation I have not the slightest doubt
the defendant understood the
obligations on him.  All his submissions acknowledge that.  In my view the
Court has extended every
opportunity to the defendant to put forward a Defence,
which he has failed to do.  I should add that not only has the defendant been
dilatory in relation to the matters to which I have just been referring, but
also in respect of the prosecution of the Notice of
Motion to set aside the
judgment.
<P>

21   	I am acutely aware of the requirement that due process and
procedural fairness should be accorded to all litigants.  However,
in
considering that concept, one must have regard to the rights of all parties.
As I have said it is difficult to imagine any greater
indulgences that the
Court could have offered to the defendant than those which it has in this case.
I accept that he has had difficulties
in obtaining legal advice.  However, that
does not detract from the fact that he has had, at least from 24 September
1999, in which
to file his Defence and affidavit of facts and circumstances.
That accords with the period he has requested.  To take 24 September
as the
starting date is to take the view most favourable to the defendant, in the
sense that from the time he moved to set aside
the judgment he must have been
aware, if not earlier, that he would be required to file a Defence.  I am also
aware that the plaintiff,
if put to proof, must prove its case.  However, the
defendant has not sought to deny that he signed the guarantees; that the hirer
leased and used the goods; that the hirer failed to pay the leasing charges;
that demand for payment has been made; and that payment
has not been paid.  Nor
has the defendant raised any other defence.  In those circumstances, the only
matters to be proved by the
plaintiff are the amount outstanding, the interest
payable and the entitlement to costs on an indemnity basis.
<P>

22   	In my view the time has now come when the Court must, in
fairness to the plaintiff and in the due administration of the justice,
bring
an end to the situation.  It is one in which the defendant has consistently
failed to comply with directions of the Court for
which he has asked.  There is
no guarantee that a Defence and affidavit of facts and circumstances will be
filed within a further
two weeks and, in so far as the draft document, which is
Exhibit A, is said to be part of the Defence it is quite clear that it does
not
deal with the basic matters in issue between the parties.  I appreciate that it
is only part of the Defence and that it is only
a draft, but it does not seek
to grapple with the fairly basic propositions pleaded by the plaintiff and, in
my opinion, there can
be no feeling of reasonable satisfaction that if further
time is allowed that will occur.
<P>

23   	In the result I am of the view that the application for
the adjournment must be refused.
<P>

24   	The consequence of that is that there is no defence and,
in my opinion, the failure by the defendant to comply with the various
directions of the Court, which have been given to ensure the efficient and due
administration of justice, must be that the plaintiff
is entitled to judgment
and I propose to so order.
<P>

<b>Costs Of The Notice Of Motion Filed On 19 August 1999</b>
<P>

25   	On 19 August 1999 the defendant filed a Notice of Motion
seeking to join not only the plaintiff but Australian and New Zealand
Banking
Group Limited, Group and General Finance Proprietary Limited, Avco Financial
Services Limited and St George Bank Limited.
 Subsequently he acknowledged that
that Notice of Motion must be dismissed and it was.  I reserved, however, the
question of costs
to see whether the matters raised in the Notice of Motion
would find any articulation in any Cross-Claim he saw fit to file.  This
has
not occurred and, in these circumstances, I am of the view that the defendant
must pay the costs of all respondents to that Notice
of Motion in so far as
orders have not already been made to that effect.
