<b>TUESDAY 2 FEBRUARY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1169/99 - GENE SIMRING &amp; ANOR V SCOTT MARINCHEK</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>  On 22 October 1998 the plaintiffs and the defendant
entered into a contract in the 1996 edition for the sale by the plaintiffs to
the defendant of property at 2/103 Brighton Boulevarde, North Bondi which is
lot 2 in strata plan 2455.  The purchase price was $525,000
with the usual ten
percent deposit.
<P>

2	     Strata plan 2455 was a plan which was registered on 27 October 1966
under the Conveyancing (Strata Titles) Act 1961. It showed
the areas and
boundaries of the lots as required by s 4 of that Act.
<P>

3	     That Act was repealed by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act
1973</a>, which altered the way in which lots were measured and in schedule 4
contained transitional and savings provisions as to how lots
and former common
property under the 1961 Act were to be treated thenceforth.
<P>

4	     The purchaser's solicitor had a surveyor survey the current lot and the
surveyor reported that the lot had an area of 91.8
square metres, whereas the
lot on the strata plan appeared to have an area of 106.463 square metres.  On
27 November 1998, the purchaser's
solicitor claimed compensation for this error
and misdescription in the amount of $72,307.52.
<P>

5	     The vendors' solicitors replied that as far as they could see any
discrepancy was as a result of the change of measurements
brought about by the
introduction of the 1973 Act and that there was no error or misdescription at
all. The purchaser's solicitor,
however, stuck to his guns and said in his
letter of 18 December 1998:
<P>

"By a significant amount, the area shown on Strata Plan 2455 does not
accurately describe (and, in fact, misdescribes) the actual
area of Lot 2."
<P>

6	     On the 22 January 1999 the vendors issued the current summons seeking
first a declaration that upon the true construction
of the contract the
purported claim is not a valid claim for compensation for an error or
misdescription in the contract, and in
due course an order for specific
performance.
<P>

7	     Today the purchaser filed a notice of motion seeking a stay pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a>.  The matters raised by the
first prayer of the summons and the notice of motion were heard together this
morning.
<P>

8	     It is necessary to set out cl 6 of the 1996 edition of the contract and
a summary of cl 7.  Clause 6 reads:
<P>

<b>"6.  Error or Misdescription</b>
<P>

The purchaser can (but only before completion) claim compensation for an error
or misdescription in this contract (as to the property,
the title or anything
else and whether substantial or not)."
<P>

9	     Clause 7 is headed "Claims by purchaser" and provides that a claim, if
it is to be made, is to be made before completion;
that upon a claim being made
the vendor can elect whether to rescind or not in certain circumstances, and if
the vendor does not
rescind then the contract is to be completed, the claim or
ten percent of the purchase price, whichever is the lesser, is to be paid
to
the stakeholder; the claim must be finalised by an arbitrator and then the
result of the arbitration governs.
<P>

10	     However, the purchaser is not entitled in respect of the claim to more
than the total amount claimed.  I note in passing
that this is rather odd
because it appears that it may mean that the purchaser can never get any costs
if wholly successful in the
arbitration, but that is only a matter that may be
considered next time when the form of the standard contract is reviewed, rather
than something that need trouble us in the instant case.
<P>

11	     The basal arguments of the purchaser are that it is not necessary to
evaluate the claim made by the purchaser; as soon as
the purchaser makes what
he says is a claim for compensation then it is necessary to go through the
process set out in cl 7.2; if
this process involves a reference to arbitration
then the ordinary rule is that on the insistence of either party the court
should
stay litigation pending the result of the arbitration.
<P>

12	     The argument on the vendors' side is that a claim for compensation must
be at least something which could possibly succeed
and that if one does not
have a claim that is in that area then the process does not take place at all.
Even if that were wrong,
the vendors' solicitor says that the arbitration
process only comes into play after the vendors have made their decision whether
or not to rescind.  It was also argued that in any event this would not be a
case where the court would restrain the proceedings
and compel the parties to
go to arbitration because the matter is a pure question of law which can be
dealt with by the court very,
very simply and clearly and the parties should
not be forced to go to an arbitration.
<P>

13	     There has been some debate in the authorities as to what is a claim for
an error or misdescription in this contract. In<b> Tefbao Pty Ltd v Stannic
Securities Pty Ltd</b> (1990) 5 BPR 11,189, McLelland J, following an earlier
decision of mine, held that the words "error or misdescription" did not extend
to an error in a certificate of title.  However, the decision of the Court of
Appeal in<b> Batey v Gifford</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 710</a>, because it overruled that
previous decision of mine, may also have affected the authority of the<b>
Tefbao</b> <b>case</b> and, accordingly, I will approach the matter on the
basis that cl 6 of the contract does cover a wide area of claims for
compensation.
<P>

14	     However, it does seem to me that the parties can't have intended that
whenever the purchaser states that he or she has a
claim for compensation for
an error that cl 7 must automatically apply.  The words must be read down to
some  extent and it would
seem to me the very minimum that one reads them down
is that there must be an arguable claim for compensation or a claim for
compensation
which is not so unarguably bad that it must fail.  Unless there is
a claim for compensation with at least a ghost of a chance of
succeeding, then
it could not have been the intention of the parties to subject themselves to an
expensive arbitration process which
may involve them in not only the hearing
fees for both advocates but also the costs of the arbitration.
<P>

15	     It is thus necessary to see whether the existing claim is one which
could possibly succeed.  This is not to evaluate it,
but merely to see whether
if the facts relied on by the purchaser are established, whether it would be
possible for the arbitrator
to find that there is compensation due.
<P>

16	     On the matters that have been raised, the so-called error is the
difference between the area shown in the strata plan and
the area as
surveyed.
<P>

17	     In all these cases one must look to see what was sold, as opposed to
what the purchaser is getting.  The purchaser has been
sold property 2/103
Brighton Boulevarde and the property in lot 2/SP2455.  There is no mention in
the description of the area of
land that is to be conveyed.
<P>

18	     However, the title search and the strata plan are annexed to the
contract and form part of the contract under cll 20.1 and
20.2.  However, it
must be noted that under cl 20.3 an area, bearing or dimension is only
approximate, though the difference in area
in this case might be said to be
outside the area of what could be said to be approximate.
<P>

19	     What then does the strata plan show?
<P>

20	     In my mind, all it shows is that as at the date the plan was registered
the land had the dimensions which are set out in
the plan.  There is nothing in
the material before me to show that at that stage there was any misdescription
at all because the
method of measurement at that stage probably required the
statement to be made that was made.
<P>

21	     The description of land in a certificate of title may not be exactly
the description of the land as at the present time.
 The most obvious example
applies where one has a sketch on the certificate of title of a boundary which
is a watercourse.  There,
even though there might be a sketch of a watercourse
on the certificate of title, the present position of the watercourse on the
ground will show the true boundary.
<P>

22	     This matter was considered recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal
in<b> Leader (Registrar of Titles) v Beames</b>, 13 November 1998 unreported
but noted in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJ 27.</a>  In that case the court held that incorrect
boundaries shown on a certificate of title were not a matter that affected the
ownership
of the land.  The decision of Griffiths CJ in<b> Overland v Lenehan
</b>(1901) 11 QLJ 58 is to the same effect.
<P>

23	     This reasoning ties in with the exception to indefeasibility of the
wrong description of boundaries which occurs in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act 1900</a>.
<P>

24	     Thus a statement in a certificate of title as to area in a strata plan
lodged under the 1961 Act contains no error or misdescription.
<P>

25	     Clearly the contract here contains no error or  misdescription and the
claim for compensation cannot succeed and, accordingly,
there has been no valid
claim for compensation under cl 6 of the contract.
<P>

26	     If that is not right, then one would have to look at cl 7.  Clause 7.1
gives the vendor an option to rescind. However, ordinarily
when a vendor,
knowing of an option to rescind, issues proceedings for specific performance,
the vendor elects against rescinding
because otherwise it is not entitled to
the specific performance which it claims by its deliberate act.  This is so
even though as
in this case the summons for specific performance focuses on a
declaration as to the real dispute between the parties. This was laid
down by
the Supreme Court of Michigan in<b> Cameron v Sowicka</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=227%20NW%20717" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">227 NW 717</a> (1929),
which has been followed in Canada in<b> Smith v Patel </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2082%20DLR%20%283d%29%20103" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 82 DLR (3d)
103</a>, and has been the position taken by the standard books on conveyancing in
both Australia  and Canada (see Butt,<b> Standard Contract for Sale of Land in
New South Wales </b>2nd ed (LBC, Sydney, 1998) para 6.17 and Di Castri,<b>
Canadian Law of Vendor and Purchaser</b> 2nd ed (Carswell Co, Toronto, 1976)
para 329).
<P>

27	     If I had to rule on it I would have thought on the material before me
the vendors have waived any right to rescind under
cl 7.1.  It follows I do not
favour the argument of Mr Anderson, the solicitor for the vendors, that the
time for arbitration has
not yet arrived.  However, I also do not favour the
submissions of Mr Bulley of counsel for the purchaser, that the court would
stay
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a>.
<P>

28	     Although the mere fact a question of law is involved is not sufficient
to take the case out of the normal rule that where
parties have agreed to an
arbitration there should be a stay, where there is a short simple question of
conveyancing, it seems to
me that it would not be an appropriate exercise of
the discretion to require the parties to go through an expensive arbitration
process
for little real return.
<P>

29	     Accordingly, the notice of motion for stay is dismissed with costs, and
I make declaration 1 in the summons.
<P>

30	     There is no need for any further order at the moment because the
parties will either appeal this decision and then settle
or settle the
conveyancing aspects of the contract without any further order, but for more
abundant caution I will stand the matter
over to the Registrar's list on 1
March 1999 at 9.30 am, with liberty to restore earlier.
<P>

31	     The defendant must pay the plaintiffs' costs of today. The exhibit may
stay with the papers.
<P>

                                oOo
